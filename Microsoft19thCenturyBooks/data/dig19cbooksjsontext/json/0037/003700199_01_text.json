The vicinity of Henry the Third of England, who, although individually a weak mo narch, allowed himself sometimes to be directed by able and powerful counsellors, and the divisions be tween the principal nobility of Scotland, facilitated the designs of ambition, and weakened the power of resistance ; nor can it be doubted, that during the early part of this reign, the first approaches were made towards that plan for the reduction of Scotland, which was afterwards attempted to be carried into effect by Edward the First, and defeated by the bravery of Wallace and Bruce. But in order to show clearly the state of the kingdom upon the accession of this monarch, and more especially in its relations with England, it will be necessary to go back a few years, to recount a story of private revenge, which happen ed in the conclusion of the reign of Alexander the Second, and drew after it important consequences. A tournament, the frequent amusement of this warlike age, was held near Haddington. At this play of arms, Walter Bisset, a powerful baron, who piqued himself upon his skill in his weapons, was foil ed by Patrick Earl of Athole.1 An old feud which existed between these families, embittered the defeat, and Athole was found murdered in his house, which, 1 Henry Earl of Athole had two daughters, Isobel and Fernelith.

ALEXANDER III. 3 probably for the purpose of concealment, was set on fire by the conspirators. The suspicion of this slaugh- ter, which, even in an age familiar with ferocity, seems to have excited unwonted horror, immediately fell upon the Bissets ; and although Walter was the per- son present at the tournament, the popular clamour pointed to William, the chief of the family.1 He was pursued by the nobility, who were incited to vengeance by the Earl of March, and David de Hastings, and would have been torn to pieces, had not the interfe- rence of the King protected him from the fury of the friends of Athole. Bisset strenuously asserted his in- nocence. He offered to prove, that he had been fifty miles distant from Haddington when the murder was committed ; he instantly excommunicated the assas- sins, and all who might have supported them, in every chapel in Scotland ; he offered combat to any man who dared abide the issue, but he declined a trial by jury, on account of the inveterate malice of his ene- mies. The king accepted the office of judge, and the Bissets were condemned, their estates forfeited to the Crown, and they themselves compelled to swear upon the Holy Gospel, that they would repair to Pa lestine, and there, for the remaining days of their lives, pray for the soul of the murdered earl. 1 Lord Hailes remarks, 8vo ed. p. 189, that Fordun, he should have said Bower, says the author of the conspiracy, was Walter.

Walter Bisset, however, instead of Jerusalem, sought the English court.1 There, by artfully repre senting to Henry that Alexander owed fealty to him and that, as Lord Superior, he ought to have been first consulted before judgment was given, and describing Scotland as the ally of France, and the asylum of his expatriated rebels,2 he contrived to inflame the pas sion of the English monarch to so high a pitch, that Henry determined on an immediate invasion. Nor was the temper with which Alexander received this information, in any way calculated to promote conci liation. To the complaints of the King of England, that he had violated the duty which he owed to him as his Lord Paramount, the Scottish monarch an swered, that he neither did, nor ever would, consent to hold from the King of England the smallest por tion of his kingdom of Scotland.3 His reply was warmly seconded by the spirit of his nobility. They fortified the castles situated on the marches, and the king soon found himself at the head of an army of nearly a hundred thousand foot soldiers and a thou sand horse. Henry, on the other hand, led into the field a large body of troops, with which he proceeded 1 Chronicon, Melross, p. 207. 8 Math. Paris, pp. 587, 645. Speed's Chronicle, p. 527.

De Couci, in passing a river on horseback, was unseated, dragged in the stirrup, run through the body with his own lance, and drown ed into the bargain.

The accoutrements and discipline of these two powerful armies, which were commanded by kings, and included the flower of the nobility of both countries, are highly extolled by Mathew Paris.1 The Scottish cavalry, he says, were a fine body of men, and well mounted, although their horses were neither of the Spanish nor Italian breed ; and the horsemen were clothed in armour of iron net-work. The English army far surpassed the Scottish in cavalry. It included a power of five thousand men-at-arms, sumptuously accoutred-. These armies came in sight of each other at a place in Westmoreland called Ponteland ; and the Scots prepared for battle, by confessing themselves to their priests, and expressing to each other their rea diness to die in defence of the independence of their country. As Alexander, however, was much beloved in England, the nobility of that country coldly se conded the rash enterprise of their king, and showed no anxiety to hurry into hostilities. Richard, Earl of Cornwall, brother to Henry, and the Archbishop of York, thought this a favourable moment for propo sing an armistice ; and, by their endeavours, such great and solemn preparations ended in a treaty of peace, without a lance being put in rest. Its terms were just, and favourable to both countries.2 1 M. Paris, pp. 436, 437.

Henry appears prudently to have waved all de mand of homage from Alexander for the kingdom of Scotland; and the Scottish monarch, on the other hand, who possessed land in England, for which, al though the English historians assert the contrary, he does not appear to have ever refused homage, consent ed, for himself and his heirs, to maintain fidelity and affection to Henry and his heirs, as his liege-lord, and not to enter into any league with the enemies of England, except in the case of unjust oppression. It was also stipulated, that the peace formerly entered into at York, in the presence of Otto, the Pope's le gate, should stand good ; and that the proposal, there made, of a marriage between the daughter of the King of England, and the son of the King of Scots, should be carried into effect. Alan Durward, at this time the most accomplished knight, and the best mili tary leader in Scotland, Henry de Baliol, and David de Lindesay, with other knights and prelates, swore on the soul of their lord the king, that the treaty should be kept inviolate by him and his heirs.1 Thus ended this expedition of Henry's into Scot land, formidable in its commencement, but peaceable and bloodless in its result ; - and such was the rela tive situation of the two countries, when Alexander 1 The original charter granted to Henry by Alexander may be found in Mathew Paris, p. 646.

ALEXANDER III. 7 the Third, yet a boy in his eighth year, mounted the Scottish throne. The mode in which the ceremony of his coronation was performed, is strikingly illustrative of the man ners of that age. The Bishops of St Andrews and Dunkeld, with the Abbot of Scone, attended to of ficiate ; but an unexpected difficulty arose. Alan Durward the great justiciary remarked, that the king ought not to be crowned before he was knight ed, and that the day fixed for the ceremony was un lucky. Durward was then at the head of the Scottish chivalry, and expected that the honour of knighting Alexander would fall upon himself.1 But Comyn Earl of Menteith, who loved the boy for his father's sake, insisted that there were frequent examples of the consecration of kings before they had worn the spurs of a knight ; he represented that the Bishop of St Andrews might perform both ceremonies ; he cited the instance of William Rufus having been knighted by Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury ; and he ear nestly urged the danger of delay. Nor was this danger ideal. Henry the Third, in a letter to the Pope, had artfully represented Scotland as a fee of England, and had requested his Holiness to interdict the ceremony of the coronation from taking place until Alexander obtained the permission of his feudal superior.2 Fortunately, the patriotic arguments of the Earl of Menteith prevailed.

It is difficult to believe, that, even in those days of credu lity, the nobility could digest the absurdities of this savage genealogist.2 Henry of England, at this time influenced by the devotional spirit of the age, had resolved on an expe dition to the Holy Land ; and in order to secure tranquillity to his dominions on the side of Scotland, the marriage, formerly agreed on, between his daugh- 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 81. 2 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. pp. 80, 81, 82.

A thousand knights, in robes of silk, attended the bride, on the morn of her nuptials ; and after some days spent in tournaments, feasting, and other circumstances of feudal revelry, the youthful couple, neither of whom had reached their eleventh year, returned to Scotland. \" Were I,\" says Mathew Paris, in one of those bursts of mo nastic eloquence which diversify his annals, \" to ex plain at length the abundance of the feasts, the variety and the frequent changes of the vestments, the delight of the plaudits occasioned by the jugglers, and the multitude of those who sat down to meat, my narra tive would become hyperbolical, and might produce irony in the hearts of the absent.

When Alexander performed homage for the lands which he held in England, Henry, relying upon the facility incident to his age, insidiously proposed that he should also render fealty for his kingdom of Scotland. But the boy, with a spirit and wisdom above his years, replied, \" That he had come into England upon a joyful and pacific er rand, and that he would not treat upon so arduous a question without the advice of the states of his king dom ;\" upon which the king dissembled his mortifi cation, and the ceremony proceeded.2 Alan Durward, who, as high justiciar, was the Scottish King's chief counsellor, had married the na tural sister of Alexander, and, during the rejoicings at York, was accused by Comyn, Earl of Menteith, and William, Earl of Mar, of a design against the crown. The ground on which this accusation rested, was an attempt of Durward, in which he was second ed by the Scottish chancellor,3 to procure from the court of Rome the legitimation of his wife, in order, said his accusers, that his children should succeed to 1 Math.

Henry, too, adopted measures not likely to se cure the confidence of the Scottish people. He sent into Scotland, under the name of guardian to the king, Geoffry de Langley, an insolent and rapacious noble, who was immediately expelled. He procured Innocent the Fourth to grant him a twentieth of the ecclesiastical revenues of that kingdom, nominally for the aid of the Holy Land, and really for his own uses, and he dispatched Simon de Montfort, the Earl of Leicester, on a mission, described as secret in his in structions,2 but the object of which was apparent from the increasing animosity of the disputes between the Scottish nobility. Many English attendants, some of them persons of rank and consequence, accompa nied Margaret into her new kingdom ; and between these intruders and the ancient nobility of Scotland, who fiercely asserted their privileges, disputes arose, which soon reached the ears of the English court.

He had accompanied Henry in his expedition to Guienne, where, by his courage and address, he regained the confidence of that capricious monarch ;2 and he now prevailed upon the king to dispatch the Earl of Gloucester, and Maunsell, his chief secretary, to the Scottish court, for the purpose of dismissing those ministers who were found not sufficiently obsequious to England.3 In sending these noblemen upon this mission, Henry en tered into a solemn agreement not to attempt any injury against the person of the Scottish King, or to insist upon his being disinherited, or to endeavour to dissolve the marriage engagements,4 the particular history of which is involved in much obscurity, but which strongly, though generally, demonstrate, that 1 Math.

At the head of the party which steadily opposed the in terested designs of Henry, was Walter Comyn, Earl of Menteith, whose loyalty we have seen insisting on the speedy coronation of the young king, when it was attempted to be deferred by Alan Durward. Many of the principal nobility, and some of the best and wisest of the clergy, were found in the ranks of the same faction. The Earl of Gloucester and his associates accord ingly repaired to Scotland ; and, in concert with the Earls of Dunbar, Strathern, and Carrick, surprised the Castle of Edinburgh, relieved the royal couple from the real or pretended durance in which they were held, and formally conducted them to the bridal chamber although the king was yet scarcely four teen years of age.1 English influence appears now to have been predominant ; and Henry, having heard of the success of his forerunners, Maunsell and Glou cester, and conceiving that the time was now come for the reduction of Scotland under his unfettered control, issued his writs to his military tenants, and assembled a numerous army. As he led this array towards the borders, he took care to conceal his real intentions, by directing, from Newcastle, a solemn engagement, that in this progress to visit his dear son Alexander, he should attempt nothing prejudicial 1 Math.

The government of Scotland was remo delled, a new set of counsellors appointed, and the party of the Comyns, with John Baliol and Robert de Ros, completely deprived of their political influ ence. In the instruments drawn up upon this occa sion, some provisions were inserted which were loudly complained of by the Scottish party, as derogatory to the dignity of the kingdom ; the abettors of England were stigmatized as conspirators, who were equally obnoxious to prelates, barons, and burgesses ; and the Bishop of Glasgow, the Bishop Elect of St Andrews, the chancellor, and the Earl of Menteith, indignantly refused to affix their seals to a deed, which, as they asserted, compromised the liberties of an independent country.2 A regency was now appointed, which included the whole party of the clergy and the nobility who were favourable to England,3 to whom were intrusted the 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. i. pp. 560, 561.

Nor are our more modern historians, who have not submitted to the task of examining the original authorities, at all free from the same fault. Maitland gives almost a transcript of Buchanan.

It was difficult and protracted ; so that in the interval the king and the Comyns, having time to collect a large army, found themselves in a situation to insist upon terms which were alike favourable to their own power, and to the independence of the country.

Men forgot their respect for the kingly authority, and de spised the restraint of the laws ; the higher nobles enlisted under one or other of the opposite parties, plundered the lands, and slew the retainers of their rival barons ; churches were violated, castles and ham lets razed to the ground, and the regular returns of seed-time and harvest interrupted by the flames of private war. In short, the struggle to resist English interference was fatal, for the time, to the prosperity of the kingdom, and what Scotland gained in inde pendence, she lost in security and national happiness. At this crisis, when they had effectually succeeded in diminishing, if not destroying, the English influ ence, the Comyns lost the leader, whose courage and energy were the soul of their councils. Walter Comyn, Earl of Menteith, died suddenly. It was reported in England that his death was occasioned by a fall from his horse ;2 but a darker story arose in Scotland. The Countess of Menteith had encouraged a criminal pas sion for an English baron named Russel,3 and was 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. i. New Ed. p. 378. 2 Math.

Horton arrived at the period when the parliament was assembled, and found the nobility very jealous of this perpetual interference of England. They deem ed these visits incompatible with the dignity of an in dependent country, and the messenger of Henry met with great opposition.2 The nature of the message increased this jealousy. It was a request that Alex ander and his queen should repair to London, to treat of matters of great importance, but which were not communicated to the parliament ; and it was not sur prising that the nobility, profiting by former expe rience, should have wisely taken precautions against any sinister designs of Henry.

Alexander, accordingly, in the month of October, repaired with a concourse of his nobility to the court tf England, and left his queen, whose situation now speedily promised an heir to the Scottish throne, to follow him by slow stages, with the Bishop of Glas gow. On her approach to St Albans, she was met by her younger brother Edmund, who received her with a splendid retinue, lodged her sumptuously, and con ducted her in the morning to London. The object of this visit of Alexander was not solely to gratify the King of England. He was anxious to exercise his rights over the territory of Huntingdon, which he held of the English crown, and the payment of his wife's portion had been so long delayed, that he wished to reclaim the debt. The reception of the royal persons appears to have been unusually magnificent, and the 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. i. pp. 713, 714. Math. Westminster, p. 376."], [39, "1261.

Having secured this, Alexander returned to his kingdom, aud in the month of February 1261, his young queen was delivered at Windsor of a daughter, Margaret, afterwards married to Eric King of Nor way.2 In the beginning of the following year, Henry seems to have interposed his good offices, to prevent a rup ture between Alexander and Haco King of Norway, regarding the possession of the western islands, the petty chiefs of which had for a long period been feu datory to the Norwegian crown.3 Their habits of constant war and piratical excursion had at this time rendered the Norwegians a formidable people, and their near vicinity to Scotland enabled them at a very early period to overspread the whole of the West- 1 Math.

The little sovereignties of these islands, under the protection of a warlike government, appear to have been in a flourishing condition. They were crowded with people ; and the useful and orna mental arts were carried in them to a higher degree of perfection than in the other European countries. A poet of the north, in describing a dress unusually gorgeous, adds, that it was spun by the Sudureyans.1 And even in science and literature, this remarkable people had, in their colonies especially, attained to no inconsiderable distinction.2 The vicinity of such enterprising neighbours was particularly irksome to the Scottish kings, and they anxiously endeavoured to get possession of these is lands. When treaty failed, they encouraged their subjects of Scotland to invade them ; and Alan, Lord of Galloway, assisted by Thomas, Earl of Athole, about thirty years before this, carried on a successful war against the isles, and expelled Olaf the Black, King of Man, from his dominions.3 These Scottish chiefs had collected a large fleet, with a proportiona bly numerous army, and it required all the exertions of the Norwegian King to re-establish his vassal on his island throne. After this, the authority of Norway became gradually more and more precarious through- 1 Johnson's Lodbrodkar Guida, stanza xv. and explanatory note. 2 Macpherson's Illustrations, ut supra, voce \" His.\" 3 Johnston, Antiquitates Celto-Normannic\u00e6, p. 30.

The expres sions used in threatening this invasion, may convince us that the Norwegians had not only acquired the sovereignty of the isles, but had established them selves upon the mainland of Scotland ; for the Scottish king declares, \" that he will not desist till he hath set his standard upon the cliffs of Thurso, and sub dued all that the King of Norway possessed to the westward of the German Ocean.\" 1 Alexander the Second, however, lived only to conduct his fleet and army to the shores of Argyleshire ; and, on the King's death, the object of the expedition was abandoned.2 During the minority of Alexander the Third, all idea of reducing the isles seems to have been aban doned, but when the King was no longer a boy, the measure was seriously resumed ; and after an unsuc- 1 Chronicle of Man, p. 43. 2 Math.

Their expedition was accompanied with circumstances of ex treme cruelty. The Scottish soldiers, if we may believe the Norwegian Chronicles, not contented with the sack of villages and the plunder of churches, in their wanton fury raised the small children on the points of their spears, and shook them till they fell down to their hands : barbarities which might be thought in credible, were we not acquainted with the horrid atro cities which, even in our own days, have accompanied piratic warfare.2 Such conduct effectually roused Haco, the Norwe gian King. He determined to revenge the injuries offered to his vassals, and immediately issued orders for the assembling of a fleet and army, whilst he re paired in person to Bergen, to superintend the prepa rations for the expedition. The magnitude of these spread an alarm even upon the coasts of England. It was reported, that the Kings of Denmark and Nor way, with an overwhelming fleet, had bent their course against the Scottish islands ; 3 and although the ap parent object of Haco was nothing more than the 1 Chronicle of Man, p. 45. 2 The Chronicle of Man says, the Earl of Ross was assisted by Keamach and the son of Macalmal.

On the 7th of July the fleet set sail from Herlo ver. The king commanded in person. His ship, which had been built at Bergen, was entirely of oak, of great dimensions,1 and ornamented with richly car ved dragons, overlaid with gold. Everything at first seemed to favour the expedition. It was midsum mer, the day was fine, and innumerable flags, pennons, and gonfanons, flaunted in the breeze ; the decks were crowded with knights and soldiers, whose armour glit tered in the sun ; and the armament, which was consi dered as the most powerful and splendid that had ever sailed from Norway, bore proudly away with a light wind for Shetland, which it reached in two days.2 Haco thence sailed to Orkney, where he proposed to separate his forces into two divisions, and to send one of these to plunder in the firth of Forth, whilst he himself remained in reserve, with his largest ships and the greater part of his army, in Orkney. It happened, however, that the higher vassal and retainers, who appear to have had a powerful influence in the general direction of the expedition, refused to go anywhere without the king himself, and this project was aban- 1 Norse Account of this Expedition, with its translation, publish ed by Johnston, p. 25.

This coun try, exposed from its situation to perpetual piratic in vasions, was, as we have seen, in 1249, under the do minion of Norway. But this did not long continue. The exertions of the Scottish government succeeded in reducing the inhabitants \u2014 hostages were exacted for their fidelity ; 3 and now we find this remote dis trict in the state of a Scottish province, exposed to the exactions of Norway. No aid, however, ap peared from Scotland, and the Caithnesians quietly submitted to the tribute which Haco imposed upon them. It is remarked by the Norwegian Chronicle, that when their king lay with his fleet in Ronaldsvoe, \" a great darkness drew over the sun, so that only a little ring was bright round his orb.\" The ancient historian thus afforded to modern science the means of exactly ascertaining the date of this great expedi tion. The eclipse was calculated, and it was found to have taken place on the 5th of August 1263, and to have been annular at Ronaldsvoe in Orkney ; a fine example of the clear and certain light reflected by the 1 Norse Account, p. 43. 2 Observations on the Norwegian Expedition, Antiquarian Trans actions, p. 363, vol. ii. 3 The Chronicle of Melrose is thus evidently wrong in placing this expedition in 1262."], [45, "1264.

Early in August, thc king sailed across the Pentland firth, having left or ders for the Orkney men to follow him when their preparations were completed ; thence he proceeded by the Lewes to the Isle of Sky, where he was joined by Magnus, the Lord of Man ; and from this hold ing on to the Sound of Mull, he met Dugal, and other Hebridean chiefs, with their whole forces. The united armament of Haco now amounted to above a hundred vessels, most of them large, all well provided with men and arms ; and, on the junction of the fleet, the details of piracy commenced. A division of the forces first took place.1 A squadron of fifty ships, under Magnus and Dugal, was sent to plunder in the Mull ; five ships were dispatched for the same purpose to Bute; and the king himself, with the rest of the fleet, remained at Gigha, a little island between the coast of Kan tire and Isla. He was here met by King John, one of the island chiefs, whom Alexander the Second had in vain attempted to seduce from his fide lity to Norway. John was now, however, differently situated, and a scene took place which is strongly il lustrative of feudal manners. Haco desired him to follow his banner, as was his duty ; upon which the island prince excused himself. He affirmed, that he had taken the oaths as a vassal of the Scottish King ; that he held of him more lands than of his Norwegian master ; and he entreated Haco to dispose of all those estates which he had conferred on him. This reason- 1 Norse Account of the Expedition, p. 49,"], [46, "1264. 30 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. ing, although not agreeable to his powerful superior, was apparently such as Haco could not dispute ; and after a short time John was dismissed, not only un injured, but with presents.1 Indeed, many of these island chiefs found them selves, during this northern invasion, in a very dis tressing situation. On one hand, the destroying fleet of Haco lay close to the shores of their little terri tories, eager to plunder them should they manifest the slightest resistance. On the other, they had given hostages for their loyal behaviour to the King of Scotland,' and the liberty, perhaps the lives, of their friends, or their children, were forfeited if they deserted to the enemy. In this cruel dilemma was Angus, Lord of Kantire and Isla, apparently a per son of high authority in these parts, and whose alle giance the Scottish King seems to have adopted every method to secure. He held his infant son as a hos tage : a solemn instrument was drawn out, which de clared his territories subject to instant forfeiture if he deserted, and the Barons of Argyle were compelled to promise that they would faithfully se$e the King against Angus of Isla, and unite in accomplishing his ruin, unless he continued true to his oaths.2 But the power of the King of Scotland was remote, the vengeance of piratical warfare was at his door ; and 1 Norse Account of the Expedition, p. 51.

ALEXANDER III. 31 Angus, with another island prince, Murchad of Kan tire, submitted to Haco, and delivered up the whole lands which they held of Alexander. A fine of a thousand head of cattle was esteemed a proper punish ment for their desertion from Norway ; and when they renewed their oaths to Haco, he promised, what he did not live to perform, to reconcile them to the offended Majesty of Scotland.1 In the meantime, the squadron which had been dispatched towards the Mull of Kantire, made a de scent upon the peninsula, and wasted it with fire and sword ; but in the midst of their havock, and when they were proceeding to attack the greater villages, they received letters from Haco, forbidding them to plunder, and commanding them to rejoin the king's fleet at Gigha.1 Haco next dispatched one of his cap tains, with some small vessels, to join the little squadron which had sailed against Bute ; and intelligence soon after reached him, that the Castle of Rothsay, in that island, had been taken by his soldiers, and that the Scottish garrison had capitulated. A pirate chief, named Roderic, who claimed Bute as his inheritance, but who had been opposed by the islanders, and out lawed by Alexander, was at this time with Haco. His knowledge of the seas in these quarters made him useful to the invaders, and the power of Haco enabled him to gratify his revenge. He accordingly laid waste thc island, basely murdered part of the garrison of Rothsay, and leading a party of plunder- 1 Norse Account of the Expedition, pp. 55, 56."], [48, "1264 32 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. ers from Bute into Scotland, carried fire and sword into the heart of the neighbouring country. : While the king's fleet lay at Gigha, Haco recei ved messengers from the Irish Ostmen, with propo sals of submitting themselves to his power, under the condition that he would pass over to Ireland with his fleet, and grant them his protection against the at tacks of their English invaders, who had acquired the principal towns upon the coast. In reply to this proposal, the king dispatched Sigurd, the Hebri dean, with some fast-sailing ships, to communicate with the Ostmen ;2 and in the meantime, he himself, with the whole fleet, sailed round the point of Kan tire, and, entering the firth of Clyde, anchored in the Sound of Kilbrannan, which lies between the island of Arran and the mainland of Kantire. 1 Norse Account of the Expedition, pp. 63. 67. This valuable historical chronicle is interspersed with pieces of poetry, descriptive of the events which occurred.

The hapless throwers of the dart fell near the swan-frequented plain, while south from our floating pines marched a host of warriors.\" 2 Norse Account of the Expedition, p. 67. These Ostmen, or Easterlings, appear to have been the descendants of the Norwe gians, or Ostmen, who long inhabited the eastern coast of Ireland, and founded some of its best towns. They were still, in 1201, so considerable, that, at a recognition taken of the diocese of Lime rick, the arbitrators were twelve English, twelve Irish, and twelve Ostmen.

But the whole naval armament of Haco, amounting to a hun dred and sixty ships, as it entered the Firth of Clyde, became conspicuous from the opposite shores of Kyle, Carrie, and Wigton ; and the more immediate dan ger of a descent, induced the Scottish government to think seriously of some terms of pacification.

They were honourably received by Alexander, and dismissed with a promise, that such terms of ac commodation as the Scottish King could consent to, should be transmitted to Haco within a short time ; and in the meanwhile a temporary truce was agreed on.

En voys were now dispatched from Alexander to Haco, and the moderate demands of the King of Scotland make it apparent, that, at this moment, he was not prepared to resist the fleet and army of Norway. He claimed Bute, Arran, and the two islands of the Cumrays, all lying in the Firth of Clyde, as the pro perty of Scotland ; but it appears that he was willing to have given up to Norway the whole of the Isles of the Hebrides.1 These terms, so advantageous to Haco, were, fortunately for Scotland, rejected \u2014 no pa cification took place ; and the fleet of Norway bore in through the narrow strait, between the larger and the lesser Cumray, thus menacing a descent upon the coast of Ayrshire, which is scarcely two miles dis tant. The crews had now run short of victuals, the wea ther was daily becoming more threatening, a strong Scottish force of armed peasants had gathered on the shore, aud Haco was anxiously exhorted by his offi cers to give orders for a descent on the coast, were it only to recruit, by plunder, the exhausted state of their provisions.2 This measure, it seems, he was un willing to adopt, without a last message to the King of Scotland ; and for this purpose he sent an ambas sador3 to Alexander, whose commission was worded in the true style of ancient chivalry. He was to propose 1 Norse Account of the Expedition, p. 71. 2 Ibid, pp. 73, 75. 1 Kolbein Rich was his name"], [51, "1264. 35 ALEXANDER III. \" That the sovereigns should meet amicably at the head of their armies, and treat regarding a peace, which if, by the grace of God, it took place, it was well ; but if the attempt at negotiation failed, he was to throw down the gauntlet from Norway, to challenge the Scottish monarch to debate the matter with his army in the field, and let God, in his pleasure, deter mine the victory.\" Alexander would agree to no explanation, but \" seemed in no respect unwilling to fight ;\" : upon which the envoy returned from his unsatisfactory mis sion, and the truce was declared at an end. Haco now dispatched a fleet of sixty ships up the Clyde, into Loch Long, under the command of Mag- nus, King of Man, and with him four Hebridean chiefs, and two principal Norwegian officers. They penetrated and plundered to the head of Loch Long ; they then took to their boats, and dragging them across the narrow neck of land between Arrochar and Tarbat, launched them into Loch Lomond, the islands of which lake were then full of inhabitants. To these islands the Scots had retreated for security, no doubt, little anticipating the measure, which the lightness of the Norwegian craft, and the active perseverance of this bold people, enabled them to carry into execution. Their safeholds now became the scenes of plunder and bloodshed ; the islands were wasted with fire, the shores of this beautiful lake completely ravaged, and the houses on its borders burnt to the ground.2 After 1 Norse Account of the Expedition. 2 Ibid, pp. 78, 79.

But the measure of Norwegian success was now full, the spirit of the Scottish nation was highly exasperated, time had been given them to col lect their forces, and, as had been foreseen, the ele ments began to fight on their side. Upon their re turn to their fleet in Loch Long, they encountered so dreadful a storm, that ten of their vessels were com pletely wrecked.1 King Haco still lay with the rest of the fleet in the Firth of Clyde, near the little islands of the Cumrays, when, on Monday, the 1st of October, a second tempest came on, accompanied with such tor rents of hail-stones and rain, that the Norwegian chro nicler ascribes its extreme violence to the horrid pow ers of enchantment, a prevalent belief at this period.2 The wind blew from the south-west, making the coast of Ayrshire a lee shore to the fleet, and thus increa sing its distress to a very great degree.

The transport then fell alongside in such a manner, that her anchor grap pled the cordage of the King's ship ; and Haco, per ceiving the storm increasing, and finding his own ship beginning to drag her anchors, ordered the cable of the transport to be cut, and let her drift to sea. When morning came, she and another vessel were seen cast ashore. The wind still increased, and the king, imagining that the powers of magic might be controlled by the services of religion, rowed in his long boat to the islands of the Cumrays, and there, amid the roaring of the elements, ordered mass to be sung.1 But the tempest increased in fury. Many vessels cut away their masts ; his own ship, although secured by seven anchors, drove from her moorings, five galleys were cast ashore, and the rest of the fleet violently beat up the channel towards Largs.2 Meanwhile, Alexander had neglected no precau tion which was likely to ensure the discomfiture of this great armament. Before it appeared on the coast, the warders in the different castles which commanded a view of the sea, were directed to keep a strict look out, a communication by beacons was established with the interior of the country,3 and now when the tem- 1 Norse Account of the Expedition, p. 85. 2 Ibid. 3 Observations on the Norwegian Expedition against Scotland, pp. 390, 391."], [54, "1264. 38 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. pest seemed to threaten the total destruction of their enemies, a mixed multitude of armed peasants hover- ed on the surrounding heights, observing every mo- tion of the Norwegian fleet, and ready to take instant advantage of its distress. Accordingly, when the five galleys, with their armed crews, were cast ashore, the Scotch rushed down from the heights and attacked the stranded vessels. The Norwegians defended themselves with great gallantry, and Haco, as the wind had a little abated, succeeded in sending in some boats with reinforcements, and soon after em- barked himself, with the intention of joining his sol- diers ; but as soon as the king's men appeared, the Scotch retired, satisfying themselves with returning during the night, to plunder the transports.1 When morning broke, the king came on shore with a large reinforcement, and ordered the transports to be light- ened, and towed to the ships. Soon after, the Scottish army appeared at a distance, upon the high grounds above the village of Largs ; and as it advanced, with the sun's rays glancing from the spears and cuirasses, it was evident to the Norwegians, that a formidable body of troops were about to attack them. The ca- valry, although they only amounted to fifteen hundred horsemen, made a noble appearance on the heights, most of them being knights or barons from the neigh bouring counties, armed from head to heel, and mounted on Spanish horses, which were clothed in complete armour.2 All the other horses were defend- 1 Norse Account of the Expedition, p. 91. - Ibid, pp. 94, 95"], [55, "1264. ALEXANDEl! Us. 39 ed with breast-plates ; and besides this cavalry, there was a numerous body of foot soldiers, well accoutred, and for the most part armed with spears and bows.1 This force was led by Alexander, the high steward of Scotland. On the shore, at this time, was a body of nine hundred Norwegians, commanded by three principal leaders ; two hundred men occupied in ad vance a small hill which rises behind the village of Largs, and the rest of the troops were drawn up on the beach. With the advance also was the king, whom, as the main battle of the Scotch approached, his officers anxiously entreated to row out to his fleet, and send them farther reinforcements. Haco, for some time, pertinaciously insisted on remaining on shore ; but as he became more and more exposed, the barons would not consent to this, and at last prevail ed on him to return in his barge to his fleet at the Cumrays. The van of the Scottish army now began to skirmish with the advance of the Norwegians, and greatly out-numbering them, pressed on both flanks with so much fury, that, afraid of being surround ed and cut to pieces, they began a retreat which soon changed into a flight. At this critical moment, when everything depended on Haco's returning with ad ditional forces before the main body of the Scotch had time to charge his troops on the beach, a violent storm came on, which completed the ruin of the Nor wegian fleet, already shattered by the former furious gales. This cut off all hopes of landing a reinforce- 1 Norse Account of the Expedition, p. 95."], [56, "1264. 40 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. ment, and they were completely routed. Indeed, with out a miracle, it could not have been otherwise. The main body of the Scotch very far outnumbered the force of the Norwegians ; 1 and their advance, under Ogmund, flying back in confusion, threw into disor der the small battalia which were drawn up on the beach. Many of these attempted to save themselves, by leaping into their boats and pushing off from land ; others endeavoured to defend themselves in the trans port which had been stranded ; and between the an ger of the elements, the ceaseless showers of missile weapons from the Scotch, and the impossibility of re ceiving succour from the fleet, their army was great ly distressed. Their leaders, too, began to desert them, and their boats became overloaded and went down.2 The Norwegians were now driven along the shore, but they constantly rallied, and behaved with their accustomed national bravery. Many had pla ced themselves in and around some stranded vessels ; and while the main body retreated slowly, and in good order, a conflict took place beside the ships, where Piers de Curry,3 a Scottish knight, was encountered and slain. Curry appears to have been a person of some note, for he and the Steward of Scotland are the only Scottish soldiers whose names have come down to us as acting a principal part upon this occasion.

In this he was soon satisfied ; for a Norwegian, who conducted the retreat, irritated by his defiance, engaged him in single combat, and, after a short resistance, killed him by a blow which severed his thigh from his body, the sword cutting through the greaves of his armour, and penetrating to his saddle.1 A conflict now took place round the body of this young knight, the plunder of whose rich armour the retreating Norwegians could not resist ; their little square was thrown into confusion, and, as the Scotch pressed on, the slaughter became great. Haco, a Norse baron, and near in blood to the king, was slain, along with many others of the principal leaders ; and the Norwegians would have been en tirely cut to pieces, if they had not at last succeed ed in bringing a reinforcement from the fleet, by landing their boats through a tremendous surf.2 These new troops instantly attacked the Scotch upon two points, and their arrival reinspirited the Norsemen, and enabled them to form anew. It was now evening, and the day had been occupied by a protracted battle, or rather a succession of obstinate skirmishes. The Norwegians, although they fought 1 Norse Account of the Expedition, p. 99. 2 Ibid. p. 101."], [58, "1264 42 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. with uncommon spirit, had sustained severe loss, and they now made a last effort to repulse the Scotch from the high grounds immediately overhanging the shore. The desperate impetuosity of their attack succeeded, and the enemy were driven back after a short and fu- rious resistance.1 The relics of this brave body of in- vaders then reimbarked in their boats, and, although the storm continued, arrived safely at the fleet. Du- ring the whole of this conflict, which lasted from morning till night, the storm continued raging with unabated fury, and the remaining ships of Haco were dreadfully shattered and distressed. They drove from their anchors, stranded on the shore, where thousands perished \u2014 struck against shallows and rocks, or found equal destruction by running foul of each other; and the morning presented a beach covered with dead bo- dies, and a sea strewed with sails, masts, cordage, and all the melancholy accompaniments of wreck.5 A truce was now granted to the king ; and the interval was employed in burying his dead, and in raising above them those rude memorials, which, in the shape of tumuli and huge perpendicular stones, still remain to mark the field of battle. The Norwegians then burnt the stranded vessels, and, after a few days, ha ving been joined by the remains of the fleet, which 1 Norse Account of the Expedition, p. 103. \" At the conflict of corslets on the blood-red hill, the damasked blade hewed the mail of hostile tribes, ere the Scot, nimble as the hound, would leave the field to the followers of our all-conquering king.\" 2 Fordun, c. 16.

ALEXANDER III. 43 had been sent up Loch Long, their shattered navy weighed anchor, and sailed towards Arran.1 In Lamlash Bay the king was met by the commis- sioners whom he had sent to Ireland, and they assured him that the Irish Ostmen would willingly maintain his army, until he had freed them from the dominion of the English. Haco was eager to embrace the pro- posal. He appears to have been anxious to engage in any new expedition which might have the effect of banishing their recent misfortunes from the minds of his soldiers, and afford him another chance of victory, with the certainty of replenishing the exhausted pro- visions of the fleet ; but their late disasters had made too deep an impression, and on calling a council, the Irish expedition was opposed by the whole army.2 The fleet therefore steered for the Hebrides, and in passing Isla, again levied a large contribution on that island. Haco, however, now felt the difference be- tween sailing through this northern archipelago, as he had done a few months before, with a splendid and conquering fleet, when every day brought the island princes as willing vassals of his flag, and retreating as he now did, a baffled invader. His boat crews were attacked, and cut off by the islanders. He appears to have in vain solicited an interview with John the Prince of the Isles. The pirate chiefs who had joined him, disappointed of their hopes of plunder, returned 1 Observations on the Norwegian Expedition, Antiquarian Trans actions, vol. ii. p. 385. 2 Norse Account of the Expedition, p. 109."], [60, "1264. 44 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. to their ocean-homes ; and although he went through the forms of bestowing upon his followers the islands of Bute and Arran, with other imaginary conquests, all must have seen, that the success and power of Scotland rendered these grants utterly unavailing.1 The weather, too, which had been his worst enemy, continued lowering, and winter had set in. The fleet encountered in their return a severe gale off Isla, and after doubling Cape Wrath, were met in the Pentland Firth by a second storm, in which one ves sel, with all on board, went down ; and another nar rowly escaped the same fate. The king's ship, how ever, with the rest of the fleet, weathered the tem pest, and at last arrived in Orkney, on the 29th of October.2 It was here found advisable to grant the troops permission to return to Norway, as, to use the simple expression of the Norwegian Chronicle, \" many had already taken leave for themselves.\" At first the king resolved on accompanying them ; but although the Chronicle endeavours to conceal the truth, it is evident that anxiety of mind, the incessant fatigues in which he had passed the summer and autumn, and the bitter disappointment in which they ended, had sunk deep into his heart, and the symptoms of a mortal distemper began to show themselves in his con stitution. His increasing sickness soon after this con- fined him to his chamber; and although for some 1 Norse Account of the Expedition, pp. Ill, 113, 117. 2 Ibid. p. 119."], [61, "1264. 45 ALEXANDER III. time he struggled against the disease, and endeavour ed to strengthen his mind by the cares of government, and the consolations of religion, yet all proved in vain. At last, feeling himself dying, the spirit of the old Norse warrior seemed to revive with the decay of his bodily frame, and after some time spent in the ser vices of the church, he commanded the Chronicles of his Ancestors the Pirate Kings to be read to him. On the 12th of December, the principal of the no bility and clergy, aware that there was no hope, at tended in the king's bedchamber. Though great ly debilitated, Haco spoke distinctly, bade them all affectionately farewell, and kissed them. He then re ceived extreme unction, and declared that he left no other heir than Prince Magnus. The Chronicle of King Swerer was still read aloud to him when he was indisposed to sleep, but soon after this his voice became inaudible, and on the 15th of December, at midnight, he expired.1 Such was the conclusion of this memorable expedi tion against Scotland, which began with high hopes and formidable preparations, but ended in the disap pointment of its object, and the death of its royal leader. It was evidently a fatal mistake in Haco to delay so long in petty expeditions against the West ern Islands. While it was still summer, and the weather fair, he ought at once to have attempted a descent upon the mainland ; and i. id he done so, Alex ander migrit have been thrown into great difficulties. 1 Norse Account of the Expedition, p. 131."], [62, "46 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1264 Delay and protracted negotiation was the policy of the Scotch. They thus avoided any general battle, and they knew that if they could detain the Norwe gian fleet upon the coast till the setting in of the winter storms, its destruction was almost inevitable. Boece, in his usual inventive vein, covers the field with twenty-five thousand dead Norwegians, and al lows only four ships to have been saved to carry the king to his grave in Orkney. But all this is fiction ; and the \" great battle of Largs\" appears to have been nothing more than a succession of fortunate skir mishes, in which a very formidable armament was effectually destroyed by the fury of the elements, and the bravery of the Steward of Scotland. The accounts of the death of Haco, and the news of the queen having been delivered of a son, were brought to King Alexander on the same day.1 He was thus freed from a restless and powerful enemy, and he could look forward to a successor of his own blood. He now lost no time in following up the ad vantages already gained, by completing the reduc tion of the little kingdom of Man, and the whole of the Western Isles. For this purpose he levied an army, with the object of invading the Isle of Man, and he compelled the petty chiefs of the Hebrides to furnish a fleet for the transport of his troops. But the King of Man, terrified at the impending ven- 1 Wynton, vol. i. pp. 389, 390.

ALEXANDER III. 47 geance, sent envoys with messages of submission, and fearful that these would be disregarded, set out him self, and met Alexander, who had advanced on his march as far as Dumfries.1 At this place the Island Prince became the liegeman of the King of Scotland, and consented that in future he should hold his king dom of the Scottish crown, binding himself to furnish to his lord paramount, when required by him, ten galleys or ships of war, five with twenty-four oars, and five with twelve. A military force was next sent against those unfortunate chiefs of the Western Isles, who during the late expedition had remained faithful to Haco.2 Some were executed, all were reduced, and the disputes with Norway were finally settled by a treaty, in which that country agreed to yield to Scotland all right over Man, the \u00c6bud\u00e6, and the islands in the Western Seas. The islands in the South Seas were also included, and those of Orkney and Shetland specially excepted. The inhabitants of the Hebrides were permitted the option of either re tiring with their property, or remaining to be govern ed in future by Scottish laws. On the part of the King and the Estates of Scotland, it was stipulated that they were to pay to Norway four thousand merks ' Fordun a Goodal, B. x. c. 18. vol. ii. p. 101.

The King of Man received investiture as a vassal of Alexander, and all parties solemnly engaged to fulfil their obligations under a penalty of ten thousand merks to be exacted by the Pope.1 Ottobon de Fieschi was at this time the Papal legate in England, and to defray the expenses of his visita tion, he thought proper to demand a contribution from each cathedral and parish church in Scotland. The king, however, with the advice of his clergy, peremptorily refused the demand, appealed to Rome, and when Ottobon requested admittance into Scotland, steadily declared that he should not set his foot over the Borders. The legate next summoned the Scottish bishops to attend upon him in England wherever he should hold his council, and he required the clergy to dispatch two of their number, who were heads of monasteries, to appear as their representa tives. This they easily agreed to, but the represen tatives were sent, not as^ the willing vassals of the pa pacy, but as the proud members of an independent church. Such, indeed, they soon showed themselves ; for when the legate procured several canons to be 1 The treaty will be found in Fordun by Hearne, p. 1353-5. It is dated 29th July 1366. In the account of the treaty, Lord Hailes has made a slight error, when he says that the patronage of the Bishoprick of Sodor was reserved to the .Archbishop of Drontheim. The patronage was expressly ceded to Alexander, but the ecclesias tical jurisdiction was reserved in favour of the Archbishop of Dron theim. 73"], [65, "1268. 49 ALEXANDER III. enacted regarding Scotland, the Scottish clergy posi tively disclaimed obedience to them. Incensed at this conduct, Clement the Fourth shifted his ground, and demanded from them a tenth of their benefices, to be paid to Henry of England, as an aid for an approaching crusade. The answer of Alexander and his clergy was here equally spirited. Scotland it self, they said, was ready to equip for the crusade a body of knights suitable to the strength and re sources of the kingdom, and they therefore rejected the requisition of his Holiness. Accordingly, David, Earl of Athole, Adam, Earl of Carrie, and William, Lord Douglas, with many other brave barons and noble knights, assumed the cross, and sailed for Pales tine.1 In consequence, however, of the Papal grant, Henry attempted to levy the tenth upon the benefices, in Scotland. The Scottish clergy refused the contri bution, appealed to Rome, and in addition to this, adopted measures, which were singularly bold, and ex cellently calculated to secure the independence of the Scottish Church. They assembled a provincial coun cil at Perth, in which a bishop of their own was chosen to preside, and where canons for the regula tion of their own church were solemnly enacted. This they contended they were entitled to do, by the Bull of Pope Honorius the Fourth, granted in the year 1 Fordun a Goodal, B. x. c. 24. Hume's Douglas and Angus, vol. i. p. 27.

These canons remain to this day an interesting speci men of the ancient ecclesiastical code of Scotland.1 About this time happened an incident of a roman tic nature, with which important consequences were connected. A noble knight, Robert de Brus, son of Robert de Brus, Lord of Annandale and Cleveland, was passing on horseback through the domains of Turnberry, which belonged to Marjory Countess of Carrie.2 The lady happened at the moment to be pursuing the diversion of the chase, surrounded by a retinue of her squires and damsels. They encoun tered Bruce. The young countess was struck by his noble figure, and courteously entreated him to remain and take the recreation of hunting. Bruce, who, in those feudal days, knew the danger of paying too much attention to a ward of the king, declined the invitation, when he found himself suddenly surround ed by the attendants ; and the lady, riding up, seized his bridle, and led off the knight, with gentle violence, to her castle of Turnberry. Here, after fifteen days, 1 These canons were printed by Wilkins in his Concilia, and in a small 4to, by Lord Hailes.

Bruce married the countess, with- out the knowledge of the relations of either party, and before obtaining the king's consent ; upon which Alexander seized her castle of Turnberry and her whole estates. The kind intercession of friends, how- ever, and a fine of gold, atoned for the feudal delin- quency, and conciliated the mind of the monarch. Bruce became, in right of his wife, Lord of Carrie ; and the son of this marriage of romantic love was the great Robert Bruce, the restorer of Scottish liberty.1 Two years previous to this, died Henry the Third of England,2 after a reign of nearly fifty years. His character possessed nothing great or noble ; his ge- nius was narrow ; his temper wavering ; his courage, happily, little tried ; and he was addicted, like many weak princes, to favouritism. At times he had per- mitted himself to be guided by able ministers ; and the vigour, talents, and kingly endowments of his son, Edward the First, shed a lustre over the last years of his reign, which the king himself could never have given it. At the coronation of Edward his successor, Alexander and his queen, the new king's sister, attended with a retinue of great pomp and splendour. He took care, however, to obtain a letter under Edward's hand, declaring that this friendly visit should not be construed into anything prejudicial to the independence of Scotland,3 a policy 1 Fordun a Goodal, B. x. c. 29. 2 On 16th Nov. 1272. 3 Ayloffe's Calendars of Ancient Charters, 328, 342.

The designs of Edward upon Scotland had not yet, in any degree, betrayed themselves, and the kingly brothers could not fail to be on cordial terms. Both were in the prime of manhood; Alexander having entered, and Edward having just completed, his thirty fourth year. Scotland, still unweakened by the fatal controversies between Bruce and Baliol, was in no state to invite ambitious aggression. The kingdom was peaceful, prosperous, and loyal, possessing a war like and attached nobility, and a hardy peasantry, lately delivered, by the defeat of Haco, and the wise acquisition of the Western Isles, from all disturbance in the only quarter where it might be dreaded ; and from the age of Alexander and his queen, who had already born him three children, the nation could look with some certainty to a successor. Edward, on the other hand, who had lately returned from Palestine, where he had greatly distinguished himself, received his brother-in-law with that courtesy and kindness which was likely to be increased by his long absence, and by the perils he had undergone. All went prosperously on between the two monarchs for some time. A dispute which had occurred with the Bishop of Durham, in which that prelate com-"], [69, "1277. ALEXANDER III. 53 plained to Edward that Alexander had encroached upon the English marches, was amicably settled, and Edward, occupied entirely with his conquest of Wales, and according to his custom, whenever engaged in war, concentrating his whole energies upon one point, had little leisure to think of Scotland. The insidious disposition of the English king first showed itself re garding the feudal service of homage due to him by his Scottish brother, for the lands which he held in England ; and he seems early to have formed the scheme of entrapping Alexander into the performance of a homage so vague and unconditional, that it might hereafter be construed into the degrading acknowledg ment that Scotland was a fief of England. In 1277 we find him writing to the Bishop of Wells, that his beloved brother, the King of Scotland, had agreed to perform an unconditional homage, and that he was to receive it at the ensuing feast of Michaelmas.1 This, however, could not possibly be true, and the event showed that Edward had either misconceived or mis stated the purpose of Alexander. He appeared be fore the English parliament at Westminster, and of fered his homage in these words : \u2014 \" I, Alexander, King of Scotland, do acknowledge myself the liege man of my lord Edward, King of England, against all deadly,\" terms which, at first sight, appear uncon ditional enough ; but after having thus offered his fealty, Alexander requested that the oath should be 1 Rymer, F\u0153deia, vol. ii. p. 109."], [70, "1278. 54 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. taken for him by Robert de Brus, Earl of Carrie, which being granted, that noble earl took the oath, in these words : \u2014 : \" I, Robert, Earl of Carrie, according to the autho rity given to me by my lord the King of Scotland, in presence of the King of England, and other pre lates and barons, by which the power of swearing upon the soul of the King of Scotland was conferred upon me, have, in presence of the said King of Scotland, and commissioned thereto by his special precept, sworn fealty to Lord Edward, King of England in these words : \u2014 ' I, Alexander, King of Scotland, shall bear faith to my Lord Edward, King of England, and his heirs, with my life and members, and worldly sub stance, and I shall faithfully perform the services, used and wont, for the lands and tenements which I hold of the said king.' \" Which fealty being sworn by the Earl of Carrie, the King of Scotland confirmed and ratified the same.1 Such is an exact account of the homage performed by Alexander to Edward, as given in the solemn instrument by which the English mo narch himself recorded the transaction. The conduct of Edward was crafty and ungenerous, that of Alex ander firm, open, and temperate. He probably had not forgotten the insidious snare in which Edward's 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. ii. p. 126. Tyrrel, vol. iii. p. 22, misled by Knighton, B. iii. c. i. erroneously says, that the homage was performed by Alexander at Edward's coronation, and adds, by an other error, that historians do not say whether it was for Scotland, or for the Earldom of Huntingdon."], [71, "1281. 55 ALEXANDER HI. father had attempted to entrap him, when still a boy, and these repeated stratagems might justly have in- censed him. But he wished not to break with Ed- ward ; he held extensive territories in England, for which he was willing, as he was bound in duty, to pay homage, yet he so guarded his attendance at Edward's coronation, and his subsequent oath of fealty, that the independence of Scotland as a kingdom, and his own independence as its sovereign, were not touched in the most distant manner ; and the King of England, baffled in his attempt to procure the unconditional homage which he expected, was forced to accept it as it was given. It is material to notice that in the in- strument drawn up afterwards, recording the transac- tion, but which the King of Scotland and his nobi- lity either never saw, or refused to acknowledge, Ed- ward declares his understanding that this homage was merely for the Scottish king's possessions in England, by reserving his absurd claim of homage for Scotland, whenever he or his heirs should think proper to make it. This matter being concluded, Alexander began to seek alliances for his children. He married his daugh ter Margaret, to Eric, King of Norway, then a youth in his fourteenth year. Her portion was fourteen thou sand merks, the option being left to her father to give one- half of the sum in lands, provided that the rents of thc lands were a hundred merks yearly for every thou sand retained. The price of land at this early period of our history seems therefore to have been ten years'"], [72, "1281. 56 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. purchase.1 The young princess, accompanied by Wal ter Bullock, Earl of Menteith, his countess, the Ab bot of Balmerino, and Bernard de Monte-alto, with other knights and barons, sailed for Norway ; and on her arrival was honourably received and crowned as queen. The alliance was wise and politic. It pro mised to secure the wavering fealty of those proud and warlike island chiefs, who, whenever they wished to throw off their dependence on Scotland, pretended that they were bound by the ties of feudal vassalage to Norway, and whose power and ambition often re quired the presence of the king himself to quell them.2 This marriage was soon after followed by that of Alexander the Prince of Scotland, then in his nine teenth year, to Margaret, a daughter of Guy, Earl of Flanders. The ceremony was conducted with great pomp, and fifteen days' feasting, at Roxburgh. Such alliances, so far as human foresight could reach, pro mised happiness to Alexander, while they gave an al most certain hope of descendants. But a dark cloud began to gather round Scotland, and a train of cala mities, which followed in sad and quick succession, 1 The marriage-contract, which is very long and curious, is to be found in Rymer, vol. ii. p. 1079, dated 25th July 1281.

ALEXANDER III. 57 spread despondency through the kingdom.1 The Prince of Scotland, who from infancy had been of a sickly constitution, died not long after his marriage, leaving no issue ; and intelligence soon after came from Norway that his sister, Queen Margaret, was also dead, having left an only child, Margaret, gene rally called the Maiden of Norway. David, the second son of Alexander, had died when a boy, and thus the King of Scotland, still in the flower of his age, found himself a widower, and bereft by death of all his children. To settle the succession was his first care ; and for this purpose a Parliament was held at Scone, on the 5th of February 1283-4. The states of Scotland there bound themselves to acknowledge Margaret, Princess of Norway, as their sovereign, failing any children whom Alexander might have, and failing any issue of the Prince of Scotland deceased. The Parliament in which this transaction took place, ha ving assembled immediately after the death of thc prince, it was uncertain whether the princess might not yet present the kingdom with an heir to the crown. In the meantime, the king thought it prudent to make a second marriage, and chose for his bride a young and beautiful woman, Joleta, daughter of the Count de Dreux. The nuptials were celebrated with great pomp, (April 15, 1285,) and in presence of a splendid concourse of the French and Scottish nobility, at Jed- 1 The Queen of Scotland died soon after Edward's coronation, in 1274-5.

In the midst of the rejoicings, aud when music aud pastime were at the highest, a strange masque was exhibited, in which a spectral creature like Death, glided with fearful gestures amongst the revellers, and at length suddenly vanished. The whole was probably intended as an excellent mum mery ; but it was too well acted, and struck such ter ror into the festive assembly,1 that the chronicler, For dun, considers it as a supernatural shadowing out of the future misfortunes of the kingdom. These mis fortunes too rapidly followed. Alexander, riding late, in winter time, near Kinghorn, was counselled by his attendants, as the night was dark, and the road pre cipitous, not to pass Inverkeithen till the morning. Naturally courageous, he insisted on galloping for ward, when his horse suddenly stumbled over a rocky cliff above the sea, fell with its rider, and killed him on the spot.2 He died in the forty-fifth year of his age, and the thirty-seventh of his reign ; and his death, at this particular juncture, may be consi dered as one of the deepest amongst those national calamities which chequer the history of Scotland. Alexander's person was majestic ; and although his figure was too tall, and his bones large, yet his limbs were well formed, and strongly knit. His counte nance was handsome, and beamed with a manly and sweet expression, which corresponded with the cou rageous openness and sincerity of his character. He was exceedingly firm and constant in his purposes, yet, 1 Fordun a Goodal, B. x. c. 40. Holinshed, vol. i. p. 409. - Triveti Annales, p. 267. He died, March 16, 1285."], [75, "1285. ALEXANDER III. 59 guided by prudence and an excellent understanding, this quality never degenerated into a dangerous ob stinacy. His inflexible love of justice, his patience in hearing disputes, his affability in discourse, and facility of access, endeared him to the whole body of his people, whilst his piety, untinctured with any slavish dread of the Popedom, yet mixed with humi lity to heaven, rendered him the steadfast friend of his own clergy, and their best defender against the en croachments of the Romish church. In his time, therefore, to use the words of the honest and affec tionate Fordun, \u2014 \" The church flourished, its minis ters were treated with reverence, vice was openly dis couraged, cunning and treachery were trampled un der foot, injury ceased, and the reign of virtue, truth, and justice, was maintained throughout the land.\" We need not wonder that such a monarch was long and affectionately remembered in Scotland. Attended by his justiciary, by his principal nobles, and a military force, which awed the strong offenders, and gave con fidence to the weak aud oppressed, it was his custom to make an annual progress through his kingdom, for the redress of wrong, and the punishment of evil-doers. For this purpose, he divided the kingdom into four great districts, and on his entering each county, the sheriff had orders to attend on the kingly judge, with the whole militia of the shire,1 and to continue with the court till the king had heard all the appeals of that county, which were brought before him. He then continued his progress, accompanied by the she- 1 Fordun a Goodal, B. x. c. 41."], [76, "60 1285.

In this manner the people were freed from the charge of supporting those overgrown bands of inso lent retainers which swelled the train of the Scottish nobles, when they waited on the king in his progresses ; and as the dignified prelates and barons were inter dicted by express laws from travelling with more than a certain number of horse in their retinue, the poor commons had leisure to breathe, and to pursue their honest occupations. In Alexander's time, many vessels of different countries came to Scotland, loaded with various kinds of merchandise, with the design of exchanging them for the commodities of our kingdom. The king's mind, however, was unenlightened on the subject of freedom of trade ; and the frequent loss of valuable cargoes by pirates, wrecks, and unforeseen arrestments on light occasions, had induced him to pass some se vere laws against the exportation of Scottish mer chandise. Burgesses, however, were allowed to traffic with these foreign merchantmen, and in a short time the kingdom became rich in every kind of wealth, in the productions of the arts aud manufactures, in mo ney, in agricultural produce,1 in flocks and herds, so 1 Yhwmen, pewere Karl, or Knawe Dat wes of mycht an ox til hawe, He gert that man hawe part in pluche ; Swa wes come in his land enwche ; Swa than bogowth, and ester lang Of land wes mesure, ane ox-gang."], [77, "1285. 61 ALEXANDER III. that many, says an ancient historian, came from the West and East to consider its power, and to study its polity. Amongst these strangers, there arrived in a great body the richest of the Lombard merchants, and offered to build royal settlements in various parts of the country, especially upon the mount above Queensferry, and on an island near Cramond, provi ded the king would grant them certain spiritual im munities. Unfortunately, the proposal of these rich and industrious men, for what cause we cannot tell, proved displeasing to the states of the realm, and was dismissed ; but from an expression of the historian, we may gather, that the king himself was desirous to encourage them, and that favourable terms for a settle ment would have been granted, unless death had stept in, and put an end to the negotiation.1 The conduct pursued by this king, in his inter course with England, was marked by a judicious union of the firmness and dignity which became an inde pendent sovereign, with the kindliness befitting his near connexion with Edward ; but warned by the ungenerous attempts which had been first made by the father, and followed up by the son, he took care, that when invited to the English court, it should be so- Mychty men that had ma Oxyn, he gert in pluchys ga.

Margaret, the grand-daughter of Alexander, and grand-niece to Edward the First, who had been solemnly acknowledged heir to the Crown in 1284, was in Norway at the time of the king's death. A Parliament, therefore, assembled at Scone, on the 11th of April 1286, and a regency, consisting of six guardians of the realm, was, by common consent, ap pointed. The administration of the parts of Scotland to the north, beyond the Firth of Forth, was intrust ed to Fraser, Bishop of St Andrews, Duncan, Earl of Fife, and Alexander, Earl of Buchan. The govern ment of the country to the south of the Forth, was committed to Wishart, the Bishop of Glasgow, John Comyn, Lord of Badenoch, and James, the High Steward of Scotland.1 Nothing but the precarious life of an infant now stood between the crown of Scotland, and the claims of various powerful competitors, whose relationship to the royal family, as it raised their hopes, encouraged them to collect their strength, and gave a legal sanc tion to their ambition.

On being informed of the state of confusion into which i Fordun a Hearne, p. 951."], [80, "1286. 64 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. the death of Alexander was likely to plunge a king dom which had been for some time the object of his ambition, the project of a marriage between the young queen and his son the Prince of Wales, was too ap parent not to suggest itself. But this monarch, al ways as cautious of too suddenly unveiling his pur poses as he was determined in pursuing them, did not immediately declare his wishes. He contented himself with observing the turn which matters should take in Scotland, certain that his power and influence would in the end induce the different parties to ap peal to him, and confident that the longer time which lie gave to these factions to quarrel among themselves, and embroil the country, the more advantageously would this interference take place. The youth of the King of Norway, father to the young Princess of Scotland, was another favourable circumstance for Edward. Eric was only eighteen. He naturally looked to Edward, the uncle of his wife, for advice and support, and fearful of trusting his infant and only daughter, scarce three years old, to the doubtful allegiance of so fierce and ambitious a nobility as that of Scotland, he determined to keep her for the pre sent under his own eye in Norway. Meanwhile a strong party was formed against her, amongst the most powerful of the Scottish Barons. They met, (Sept. 20, 1286) at Turnberry, the castle of Robert Bruce, Earl of Carrie, son of Robert Bruce, Lord of Annandale and Cleveland. Here they were join ed by two powerful English barons, Thomas de Clare, brother of Gilbert, Earl of Gloucester, and Richard n"], [81, "1286. MARGARET. 65 de Burgh, Earl of Ulster.1 Thomas de Clare was nephew to Bruce's wife, and both he and his brother, the Earl of Gloucester, were naturally anxious to sup port Bruce's title to the crown, as the descendant of David Earl of Huntingdon, brother of King William the Lion.2 Nor was the scheme in any respect a des perate one, for Bruce already had great influence. There assembled at Turnberry, Patrick, Earl of Dun bar, with his three sons ; Walter Stewart, Earl of Menteith ; Bruce's own son, the Earl of Carrie, and Bernard Bruce ; James, the High Steward of Scot land,3 with John his brother ; Angus, son of Donald the Lord of the Isles, and Alexander his son. These barons, whose influence could bring into the field the strength of almost the whole of the West and South of Scot land, now entered into a bond, or covenant, by which it was declared, that they would thenceforth adhere to and take part with one another, on all occasions, and against all persons, saving their allegiance to the King of England, and also their allegiance to him who should gain the kingdom of Scotland by right of descent from King Alexander, then lately decea sed.4 Not long after this, the number of the Scottish 1 Ridpath's Border Hist. p. 164. 2 Gough, in his Additions to Cambden's Britannia, vol. i. p. 265, mentions, that Gilbert, Earl of Gloucester, brother of Robert de Brus's wife, having incurred the resentment of Edward the First, was dispossessed of all his lands ; but the king afterwards restored him, and gave him his daughter in marriage.

Regents was reduced to four, by the assassination of Duncan, Earl of Fife, and the death of the Earl of Buchan, while another of the regents having pursued an interest at variance with the title of the young queen, and joined the party of Bruce, heart-burnings and jealousies arose between the nobility and the go vernors of the kingdom. The event which the saga city of Edward had anticipated now occurred. The States of Scotland were alarmed at the prospect of civil commotions, and in a foolish imitation of other foreign powers, who had applied to Edward to act as a peacemaker, sent the Bishop of Brechin, the Abbot of Jedburgh, and Geoffrey de Moubray, as ambassadors to the King of England, requesting his advice and mediation towards composing the troubles of the kingdom.1 At the same time, Eric King of Norway dispatched plenipotentiaries to treat with Edward regarding the affairs of his daughter the queen, and her kingdom of Scotland. The king readily accepted both offers ; and finding his presence no longer necessary in France, returned to Eng land, to superintend in person those measures of in trigue and ambition which now entirely occupied his mind. \" Now,\" said he, to the most confiden tial of his ministers, \" the time is at last arrived when Scotland and its petty kings shall be reduced under my power.\"2 But although his intentions were declared thus openly in his private council, he 1 Fordun a Goodal, p. 138, vol. ii. places this embassy in 1286.

At his request, the Scottish Regents ap pointed the Bishops of St Andrews and Glasgow, assisted by Robert Bruce, Lord of Annandale, and John Comyn, to treat in the presence of the King of England regarding certain matters proposed by the Norwegian commissioners, and empowered them to ratify whatever was there agreed on, \" saving al ways the liberty and honour of Scotland ;\" and pro vided that from such measures nothing should be like ly to occur prejudicial to that kingdom and its sub jects.1 To this important conference the king, on the part of England, sent the Bishops of Winchester and Durham, with the Earls of Pembroke and Warren. The place appointed was Salisbury ; but previous to the meeting of the plenipotentiaries, Edward secretly procured a dispensation from the Pope for the mar riage of his son, the Prince of Wales, to the young Princess of Norway, as the youthful pair were within the forbidden degrees.2 No hint, however, of this projected union was yet suffered to transpire ; and the commissioners met at Salisbury, where a treaty was drawn up, in which no direct allusion was made to the marriage, although it included provisions which bore upon this projected union. It was there stipulated by the commissioners for Norway, that the young queen should be sent into the kingdom of Scotland or England, untrammelled by any matrimonial engagement, before the feast of All 1 Rymor, vol. ii. p. 431.

This wide and ex traordinary clause evidently gave Edward the power of detaining the heretrix of the crown for an almost indefinite period in England ; and its being inserted in this treaty, proves, that although Bruce, by ac cepting the office of Commissioner, appeared to have abandoned his son's claim to the crown, Edward was nowise satisfied that the interest which looked to a male successor to the crown, was not still pretty high in Scotland. By the third article, the States of Scot land undertook, before receiving their queen, to find security to the King of England, that the said lady should not marry without his counsel and consent, and that of the King of Norway. The Scottish commissioners next engaged for themselves, that the quiet of the kingdom of Scotland should be establish ed before the arrival of the queen, so that she might enter her dominions with safety, and continue there in at her pleasure. With regard to the removal of guardians, or public officers in Scotland, it was deter mined, that should any of these be suspected persons, or troublesome to the King of Norway, or the Queen of Scotland, they should be removed, and better per sons appointed in their place, by the advice of the good men of Scotland and Norway, and of persons se lected for this purpose by the King of England ; and"], [85, "1289- 69 MARGARET. it was stipulated, that these English commissioners were ultimately to decide all disputes regarding pub lic measures, which might occur between the mini sters of Scotland and Norway, as well as all diffe rences arising amongst the Scottish ministers them selves. It was finally agreed, that in the middle of the ensuing Lent, there should be a meeting of thc Estates of Scotland at Roxburgh, by which time the Scottish plenipotentiaries engaged, that everything to which they had now consented should be fulfilled and ratified in the presence of the commissioners of England.1 Of this convention three copies were made : one in Latin, which was transmitted to the King of Norway, and two in French, retained for the use of the Scots and English. At this period, the majority of the nobility of both countries were of Norman- French extraction, and Norman-French was alike in England and Scotland the language in which all state affairs were conducted. By this treaty, which gave so much power to Ed ward, and left so little to the Estates of Scotland, it is evident that some of the Scotch commissioners were in the interest of the English King. Bruce, Lord of Annandale, had either altered his ambitious views, or he trusted that a temporary concealment of them, and the dissatisfaction which such a convention must occasion in Scotland, might ultimately turn to his advantage. Edward, in the meantime, neglected nothing which could secure or increase the power which he had so dexterously acquired. He directed a letter 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, pp. 446, 447."], [86, "70 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1289. to the Estates of Scotland, requiriug them to be obe dient to their regents, and informing them, that he meant to send into that country some of the members of his council, from whom he might receive correct information of its condition.1 Although a dispensa tion from the Pope was already obtained, no allu sion to the intended marriage between Prince Edward and the young queen had been made throughout the whole treaty : Edward, with his usual calm foresight, seems privately to have directed the Scottish com missioners at Salisbury, three of whom were regents, to sound the nobility of Scotland on their return, and discover the feelings of the people regarding the pro jected union. Accordingly, as soon as the import ant project became generally known, a meeting of the Estates of Scotland assembled at Brigham, a village on the Tweed, near Roxburgh, and from thence di rected a letter to Edward, which was signed by all the dignified clergy, and by all the earls and barons, of the realm. It stated, that they were overjoyed to hear the good news which were now commonly spo ken of, \u2014 \" that the Apostle had granted a dispensa tion for the marriage of Margaret, their dear lady and their queen, with Prince Edward.\" It requested King Edward to send them early intelligence regard ing this important measure, and assured him of their full and ready concurrence, provided certain reason able conditions were agreed to, which should be spe cified by delegates, who would wait upon him at his Parliament, to be held next Easter at London .= 1 Rymer, vol. ii. p. 445.

The nobili ty of Scotland could not be more anxious than Ed ward for the arrival of the intended bride ; but the king employed a more effectual way than entreaty, by dispatching to Norway one of his ablest counsel lors, Anthony Beck, Bishop of Durham, who, under the plausible name of pensions, distributed money among the Norwegian ministers, and obtained a so lemn promise, that she should immediately be sent to England.1 So assured of this was Edward, that, on the arrival of the Scottish envoys to his Parliament held in Easter, he came under an engagement to pay three thousand marks to Scotland, if Margaret did not reach England, or her own country, before the Feast of All Saints. He next appointed the Bishop of Durham, and five other plenipotentiaries, to attend a meeting of the Scottish Estates, which was held at Brigham, (July, 1290) intrusting them with full powers to conclude that solemn treaty, on the basis of which the marriage was to take place, and, after due conference, to concur in those securities which the Scottish Estates demanded for the preservation of the independence of their country. The principal articles of this treaty of Brigham 1 Rvmer, vol. ii. p. 479."], [89, "1290. MARGARET 73 are of the utmost importance, as illustrating the jus tice and the inveteracy of that long war, which af terwards desolated the kingdoms. It was agreed by the English plenipotentiaries, that the rights, laws, liberties, and customs of Scotland were to be inviolably observed in all time coming, throughout the whole kingdom and its marches, saving always the rights which the King of England, or any other person, has possessed, before the date of this treaty, in the marches or elsewhere ; or which may accrue to him in all time coming. It was stipulated also, that fail ing Margaret and Edward, or either of them, without issue, the kingdom should return to the nearest heirs, to whom it ought of right to return, wholly, freely, absolutely, and without any subjection; so that nothing shall either be added to, or taken from the rights of the King of England, of his heirs, or of any other person whatever. The queen, if she should survive her husband, was to be given up to the Scottish na tion, free from all matrimonial engagement ; and, on the marriage, to be secured in a jointure befitting her rank. The kingdom of Scotland was for ever to re main separate and undivided from England, free in itself, and without subjection, according to its ancient boundaries'and marches. With regard to the ecclesi astical privileges of the country, it was provided, that the chapters of churches, which possessed the right of free election, were not to be compelled to travel forth of Scotland for leave to elect, or for the presen tation of the bishop or dignitary, or for the performance of fealty to the sovereign. No crown-vassal, widow,"], [90, "1290. 74 H1ST0RY OF SCOTLAND. orphan, or ward of the crown, was to be under the ne- cessity of performing their homage or relief out of the kingdom, but a person was to be appointed in Scot- land to receive the same, by the authority of the queen and her husband. From this clause was reserved the homage which ought to be performed in the presence of the king, and fealty having been once sworn, sasine of the land was immediately to be given by a brief from Chancery. It was anxiously and wisely provided, that no native of Scotland was in any case whatever to be compelled to answer out of the kingdom regarding any civil covenant or criminal delinquency which had taken place in Scotland, as such compulsion was contrary to the ancient laws and usages of the realm, and that no Parliament was to be held without the boundaries of the kingdom, as to any matters affecting the condi- tion of its subjects. Until the arrival of the queen, the great seal of Scotland was to be used in all mat ters relating to God, the church, and the nation, as it had been used during the life and after the death of the late king ; and on the queen's arrival in her dominions, a new seal, with the ancient arms of Scot land alone, and the single name of the queen engra ved thereon, was to be made, and kept by the chan cellor; it being moreover provided, that the chan cellors, justiciars, chamberlains, clerks of the rolls, and other officers of the realm, were to be natives of Scotland, and resident there. All charters, grants, relics, and other muniments touching the royal dig nity of the kingdom of Scotland, were to be deposi- ted in a safe place within that kingdom, and to be"], [91, "1290. 75 MARGARET. kept in sure custody under the seals of thc nobility, and subject to their inspection until the queen should arrive, and have living issue ; and before this event took place, no alienation, incumbrance, or obligation, was to be created in any matters touching the royal dignity of the kingdom of Scotland ; and no tallage, aids, levies of men, or extraordinary exactions to be demanded from Scotland, or imposed upon its inhabi tants, unless for expediting the common affairs of the realm, or in the cases where the kings of Scotland have been wont to demand the same. It was pro posed by the Scotch that the castles and fortresses should not be fortified anew upon the marches ; but the English commissioners, pleading the defect of their instructions, artfully waved the discussion of this point. To all the articles in the treaty, the guardians and community of Scotland gave their full consent, under the condition that they should be ra tified within a certain time.1 If not so confirmed, they were to be esteemed void ; but Edward was too well satisfied with the terms of the negotiation to postpone this condition, and accordingly, without de lay, pronounced the oath which was required. His next was one of those bold and unwarrantable steps, which frequently marked the conduct of this ambi tious and unprincipled monarch. He pretended that without the presence of an English governor, he could not fulfil the terms of his oath to maintain the laws of Scotland; and although no such authority was given him by thc treaty, he appointed Anthony 1 Before the feast of the Virgin's Nativity,"], [92, "76 1290. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Beck, Bishop of Durham, to the office of Governor of Scotland, in the name of Margaret the queen, and his dear son Edward, and for the purpose of acting in concert with the regents, prelates, and nobles, in the administration of that kingdom, according to its an cient laws and usages.1 Edward had already gain ed to his interest two of the Scottish regents ; by this measure he trusted that he could overrule their deliberations at his pleasure ; and, grown confident in his power, he intimated to the Estates, \" that certain rumours of danger and perils to the kingdom of Scot land having reached his ears, he judged it right that all castles and places of strength in that kingdom should instantly be delivered up to him.\" 2 This de mand effectually roused the Scots, and Sir William Sinclair, Sir Patrick Graham, and Sir John Foulis,3 with the other captains of the Scottish castles, per emptorily refused, in the name of the community of Scotland, to deliver its fortresses to any one but their queen and her intended husband, for whose behoof they were ready to bind themselves by oath to keep and defend them. With this firm reply Edward was obliged to be satisfied ; and sensible that he had over rated his influence, he patiently awaited the arrival of the young queen. It was now certain that she had sailed ; the guardians of the realm, accompanied by commissioners from England, were preparing to re ceive her, and all eyes, in both countries, were turned 1 Rymer, vol. ii. pp. 487, 488. 2 Rymer, vol. ii. p. 488. 3 These three knights had been high in the confidence of Alex ander the Third.

She was only in her eighth year. This fatal event, which may justly be called a great national calamity, hap pened in September 1290, and its first announcement struck sorrow and despair into the heart of the king dom. In 1284, the crown had been solemnly settled on the descendants of Alexander the Third, but the parliament and the nation, confident in the vigorous manhood of the king, and the health of his progeny, had looked no farther. All was now overcast. The descendants of Alexander were extinct, aud Bruce and Baliol, with other noble earls or barons who claim ed kindred with the blood-royal, began, some secret ly, some more boldly, to form their schemes of ambi tion, and gather strength to assert them. Previous to the report of the queen's death, a convention of the Scottish Estates had been held at Perth, to receive Edward's answer to the refusal of delivering their castles. To this meeting of the Estates Robert Bruce, Lord of Annandale, indignantly refused to come, and a great part of the nobility made no concealment of their disgust at the insolent demands of the English king. When the sad news was no longer doubtful, the miseries attendant on a contested throne soon be gan to show themselves. Bruce assembled a great force, and suddenly came to Perth. Many of the no bility declared themselves of his party, and the Earls of Mar and Athole joined him with all their follow ers. If the nation and its governors had been true to"], [94, "78 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1290. themselves, all might yet have gone well, but the money and power of England had introduced traitor ous councils. One of the guardians, William Fraser, Bishop of St Andrews, a man of a dark intriguing spirit, and a creature of the King of England, ad dressed a letter to Edward upon the first rumour of the queen's death, informing him of the troubled state of the country, and the necessity of his interposition to prevent the nation from being involved in blood. \" Should John de Baliol,\" says he, \" present himself before you, my counsel is, that you confer with him, so that, at all events, your honour and interest may be preserved. Should the queen be dead, which heaven forefend, I entreat that your highness may ap proach our borders, to give consolation to the people of Scotland, to prevent the effusion of blood, and to enable the faithful men of the realm to preserve their oath inviolable, by choosing him for their king, who by right ought to be so.\" 1 Edward's mind was not slow to understand the full import of this treacherous counsel ; and the death of the young queen, the divisions amongst the Scottish nobility, and the divided state of the national mind as to the succession, presented a tempting union of cir cumstances, too favourable for his ambition to resist. The treaty of Brigham, although apparently well calcu lated to secure the independence of Scotland, contained a clause which was artfully intended to leave room for the absurd and unfounded claim of the feudal supe riority of England over this country ; and even before the death of the Maid of Norway, Edward, in writs, i Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. ii.p. 1091."], [95, "1290.

His interference, indeed, had already been solicited by the Bishop of St Andrews, and, in all probability, by others of the Scottish nobility ; but there is not thc slightest authority for believing, that any national proposal was made by the Scottish Parliament, re questing Edward's decision as arbiter, in a question upon which they only were entitled to pronounce judgment. The motives of Edward's\" conduct, and the true history of his interference, are broadly and honestly stated, in these words of an old English his torian : \u2014 \" The King of England, having assembled his privy-council, and chief nobility, told them, that he had it in his mind to bring under his dominion the king and the realm of Scotland, in the same manner that he had 6ubdued the Kingdom of Wales.\" 2 For this purpose, he deemed it necessary to collect an army, and issued writs to his barons and mili tary tenants, commanding them to meet at Norham, with horse, arms, and all military service, on the 3d June 1291.3 The sheriffs of the counties of York, 1 Prynne, Ed.

Lancaster, Westmoreland, Cumberland, and North umberland, were also directed to summon all who owed the king service within their jurisdiction, to re pair to the rendezvous with their full powers, and, in the meantime, Edward requested the clergy and no bility of Scotland to have a conference with him at Norham on the 10th of May, to which they consent ed. Edward opened the deliberations in a speech de livered by his Justiciary, Roger Brabason, in which, after an introductory eulogium upon the godlike and regal attribute of justice, and the blessings attendant on the preservation of peace and tranquillity in a king dom, he proceeded to observe, that the sight of the great disturbances, which on the death of Alexander the Third had arisen in the kingdom of Scotland, was highly displeasing to him ; and that, for the purpose of doing justice to all who had claims upon the crown, and for the confirmation of peace in the land, he had requested its nobility to meet him, and had himself travelled from remote parts, that as Lord Paramount he might do justice to all, without encroaching upon the rights of any man. \" Wherefore,\" concluded the Justiciary, \" our Lord the King, for the due accom plishment of this design, doth require your hearty re cognition of his title of Lord Paramount of the king dom of Scotland.\" 1 This unexpected demand struck dismay and embarrassment into the hearts of the Scot tish assembly. They declared their entire ignorance that such a right of superiority belonged to the King of England, and added, that at the present conjunc- 1 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 33. 11"], [97, "1291.

They requested time to consult and deliberate with their absent members. Edward at first would give them only one day, but on their insisting that a longer interval was absolutely necessary, the king granted them three weeks, to pre pare all that they could allege against his pretensions. This delay Edward well knew would be productive of some good consequences towards his great scheme, and, at any rate, could not possibly injure his ambitious views. Before these three weeks elapsed, his army would meet him at Norham. He had already cor rupted Fraser the Regent3 by his secret intrigues, and the money and promises which he judiciously distribu ted, had induced no less than ten competitors to come forward, and claim the Scottish crown. In this way, by the brilliant prize which he held out to the most power- 1 Wallingford, p. 56. 2 Hemingford, p. 33. 3 On Aug. 13, 1291, Edward made a pilgrimage from Berwick to St Andrews, probably to consult with his friend the bishop.

All hoped that if they resigned to Edward this right of superiority, they might receive a kingdom in return ; and all felt, that to rise up as the defenders of the independency of a country, which was then torn by mutual distrust and civil disorder, which was without a king, without an army, and with the most powerful of its nobility leagued against it, would be a desperate undertaking, \u2014 and especially desperate against so able a general, so profound a po litician, and so implacable an enemy, as Edward. I say not this to palliate the disgraceful scene which followed, nor to insinuate that any circumstances can occur which entitle the subject of a free country to sacrifice its independence ; but to prove that the transaction, which was truly a deep stain upon our history, was the act not of the Scottish nation, or of the assembled states of the nation, but of a corrupted part of the Scottish nobility. To return to the story. On the 2d of June, eight of the competitors for the crown assembled, along with many of the prelates, nobles, and barons of Scotland, on a green plain called Holywell haugh, opposite to Norham Castle. These competitors were, \u2014 Robert Bruce ; Florence, Earl of Holland ; John Hastings ; Patrick Dunbar, Earl of March ; William de Ross ; William de Vescy ; Walter Huntercombe ; Robert de Pynkeny; and Nicolas de Soulis. The Bishop of Bath and Wells, then Chancellor of England, spoke for the king. He told them, that his master"], [99, "1291. MARGARET. 83 having on a former occasion granted to them three weeks to prepare their objections to his claim of being Lord Paramount, and they having brought forward no absolute answer to invalidate his right, it was the in tention of the King of England, in virtue of his ac knowledged right of superiority, to examine and de termine the difference as Lord Paramount of Scot land. The Chancellor then turned to Robert Bruce, and demanded whether he was content to acknow ledge Edward as Lord Paramount of Scotland, and willing to receive judgment from him iu that charac ter ; upon which Bruce clearly and expressly answered, that he recognised him as such, and would abide by his decision. The same question was then put to the other competitors, all of whom returned the same an swer. Sir Thomas Randolph then stood up, and de clared that John Baliol, Lord of Galloway, had mis taken the day, but would appear on the morrow ; which he did, and then solemnly acknowledged the superio rity of the English king. At this fourth assembly, the chancellor protested in the name of the king, that although with the view of giving judgment to the competitors, he now asserted his right of superiority, yet he had no intention of excluding his hereditary right of property in the kingdom of Scotland, but re served to himself the power of prosecuting such right at whatever time, and in whatever way, he judged ex pedient.1 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. ii. p. 551."], [100, "1291 84 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. The king in person next addressed the assembly. He spoke in Norman-French, recapitulated the pro ceedings, and with many professions of his extreme affection for the people of Scotland, declared his in tention not only to pronounce a speedy decision in the controversy, but to maintain the laws and re-esta blish the tranquillity of the country. John Comyn, Lord of Badenoch, called the Black Comyn, who had married a sister of Baliol, now came forward as a com petitor for the crown, and acknowledged the superiority of Edward ; after which, the claimants affixed their signatures to two important instruments. The first declared, that, \" Forasmuch as the King of England has evidently shown to us, that the sovereign seignory of Scotland, and the right of hearing, trying, and terminating our respective claims, belong to him, we agree to receive judgment from him, as our Lord Paramount. We are willing to abide by his deci sion, and consent that he shall possess the kingdom to whom he awards it.\" l By the second deed, posses sion of the whole land and castles of Scotland was de livered into the hands of Edward, under the pretence, that the subject in dispute ought always to be placed in the hands of the judge ; but on condition that Edward should find security to make a full restitution within two months after the date of his award, and that the revenues of the kingdom should be preserved for the future sovereign. It was determined, after so- Hemingford, vol. i. p. 34. Ryiner, F\u0153dera, vol. ii. p. 529."], [101, "1291. MARGARET. 85 lemn consultation with the prelates and earls, that, in order to prepare the point in dispute for an ultimate decision, Baliol and Comyn for themselves, and the competitors who approved of their list, should choose forty \" discreet and faithful men\" as commissioners ; that Bruce, for himself, and the competitors who abided by his nomination, should choose other forty ; and that Edward, the king, should select twenty-four commissioners, or, as he thought fit, a greater or lesser number. These commissioners were to meet in a body, to consider the claims of the competitors, and to make their report to the king. On the 11th of June the four regents of Scotland delivered the kingdom into the hands of Edward ; and the captains and governors of its castles, finding that the guardians of the realm, and the most powerful of its nobility, had abandoned it to its fate, gave up its fortresses to his disposal. And here, in the midst of this scene of national humiliation, one Scottish baron stood forward, and behaved worthy of his country. The Earl of Angus, Gilbert de Umfraville, who com manded the important strengths of Dundee and For far, declared, that as he had received these, not from England, but from the Estates of Scotland, he would not surrender them to Edward. A formal letter of indemnity was now drawn up, which guaranteed the Earl of Angus from all blame ; and, in name of the claimants of the crown, and of the guardians of the realm, enjoined him to deliver the castles of which he held the keys. This removed the objection of Um-"], [102, "86 1291. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. fraville, and Dundee and Forfar were placed in the hands of Edward. The King of England, satisfied with this express acknowledgment of his rights as Lord Paramount, immediately redelivered the custody of the kingdom into the hands of the regents, giving the man injunction to appoint Alan, Bishop of Caith ness, an Englishman, and one of his own creatures, to the important office of chancellor ; and to nomi nate Walter Agmondesham, another supple agent of England, as his assistant. To the four guardians, or regents, Edward next added a fifth, Bryan Fitz alan, an English baron ; and having thus secured an effectual influence over the Scottish councils, he pro ceeded to assume a generous and conciliating tone. He promised to do justice to the competitors within the kingdom of Scotland,1 and to deliver immediate possession of the kingdom to the successful claimant ; upon the death of any king of Scotland who left an heir, he engaged to wave his claim to those feudal services, which, upon such an occasion, were rigidly exacted by lords superior in smaller fiefs, with the exception of the homage due to him as Lord Para mount ; but he stipulated, that, in the event of a disputed succession occurring, the kingdom and its castles were to be again delivered into his hands.2 The first act of this extraordinary drama now drew to a conclusion. The great seal, which had been brought from Scotland for the occasion, was delivered to the joint chancellors, the Bishop of Caithness and 1 Rymer, vol. ii p. 532. : Ibid. vol. ii. p. 601."], [103, "1291. MARGARET. 87 Walter Agmondesham. The four guardians, in the presence of a brilliant concourse of English and Scot tish nobility, swore fealty to Edward as Lord Superior, while Bruce, Lord of Annandale, with his son, the Earl of Carrie, John de Baliol, the Earls of March, Mar, Buchan, Athole, Angus, Lennox, and Men teith, the Black Comyn, Lord of Badenoch, and many other barons and knights, followed them in taking the oaths of homage. A herald then proclaimed the peace of King Edward as Lord Paramount, and the king added a protestation, that his consent to do justice in this great cause within Scotland, should not preclude him from his right of deciding in any similar emer gency within his kingdom of England. The assem bly then broke up, after an agreement that its next meeting should be at Berwick on the 2d of August, on which day the King of England promised to de liver his final judgment upon the succession to the crown of Scotland.1 It was now only the 13th of July, and Edward de termined to employ the interval till the 2d of Au gust in a progress through Scotland, for the purpose of receiving the homage of its inhabitants, and exa mining in person the disposition of the people, and the strength of the country. He proceeded, by Edin burgh and Stirling, as far as Perth, visiting Dun fermline, St Andrews, Kinghorn, and Linlithgow; and at these places imperiously called upon persons of all ranks, earls, barons, and burgesses, to sign the 1 Rymer, vol. ii. p. 558."], [104, "1291. 88 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. rolls of homage, as vassals of the King of England.1 In the more remote districts, which he could not visit, he appointed officers to receive the oaths, and enforce them by imprisonment upon the refractory ; 2 and ha ving thus examined and felt the temper of the coun try, which he had determined to reduce under his dominion, he returned to Berwick, where, in the pre sence of the competitors, with the prelates, earls, and barons of both countries, assembled in the chapel of the castle, he, on the 3d of August, opened the pro ceedings. First of all, he commanded the hundred and four commissioners or delegates, to assemble in the church of the Dominicans, adjoining to the castle, and there receive the claims to the crown. Upon this, twelve claimants came forward. These were, I. Florence, Count of Holland, descended from Ada, the sister of King William the Lion. II. Patrick Dunbar, Earl of March, descended from Ilda, or Ada, daughter of William the Lion. III. William de Vescy, who claimed as grandson of Marjory, daughter of William the Lion.3 IV. William de Ross, descended from Isabella, daughter of William the Lion. V. Robert de Pynkeny, descended from Marjory, daughter of Henry, Prince of Scotland, aud sister of William the Lion. VI.

Robert de Bruce, descended from Isabel, se cond daughter of the same prince ; and lastly, XII. John de Baliol, who claimed the crown as the descendant of Margaret, the eldest daughter of William the Lion.1 The petitions of these various claimants having been read, Edward recommended the commissioners to con sider them with attention, and to give in their report at his next parliament, to be held at Berwick on the 2d of June, in the following year. This was a judicious and artful delay. It was intended to give the commis sioners an interval of nine or ten months, to institute their inquiries, yet it served the more important pur pose of accustoming the nobility and people of Scotland to look to Edward as their Lord Paramount. Accord- 1 Rymer's F\u0153dera, pp. 578, 579."], [106, "90 1292. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. ingly, when the parliament assembled at Berwick on the appointed day, and when Eric, King of Norway, appeared by his ambassadors, and insisted on his right to the crown of Scotland, as the heir of his daughter Margaret, his petition, and the claims of the first nine competitors, were easily disposed of. They were liable to insuperable objections ; some on account of the notorious illegitimacy of the branches from which they sprung, which was the case with the Earl of March, along with the barons William de Ross and De Vescy ; others were rejected because they affirm ed that they were descendants of a sister of the Earl of Huntingdon, when the direct representatives of a brother of the same prince were in the field. Indeed, before the final judgment was pronounced, these fri volous competitors voluntarily retired. They had been set up by Edward, with the design of removing the powerful opposition which might have arisen to his schemes, had they declared themselves against him, and to excuse his delay in giving judgment, by throwing an air of intricacy over the case. This ob ject being gained, the king commanded the commis sioners to consider, in the first place, the claims of Bruce and Baliol, thus quietly overlooking the other competitors, whose rights were reserved, never to be again brought forward, and virtually deciding that the crown must be given to a descendant of Da vid, Earl of Huntingdon. The scene which fol lowed was nothing more than a premeditated piece of acting, planned by Edward, and not ill performed by thc Scottish commissioners, who were completely"], [107, "1292. MARGARET. 91 under his influence. The king first required them to make oath, that they would faithfully advise him by what laws and usages the question should be deter mined ; they answered, that they differed in opinion as to the laws and usages of Scotland, and its appli cation to the question before them, and therefore re quired the assistance of the English commissioners, as if from them was to proceed more certain or accu rate advice upon the law of Scotland. A conference with the commissioners of the two nations having taken place, it was found that the differences in opi nion were not removed. The English commissioners modestly refused to decide until they were enlighten ed by the advice of an English parliament, and the king, approving of their scruples, declared his reso lution to consult the learned in foreign parts, and re commended all persons of both kingdoms to revolve the case in their minds, and consider what ought to he done. He then appointed a parliament to assem ble at Berwick on the 15th of October, at which he intimated he would pronounce his final decision. On the meeting of this parliament at the time ap pointed, Edward required the commissioners to give an express answer to these two questions : 1st, By what laws and customs they ought to regulate their judg ment ? or, in the event of there being either no laws for the determination of such a point, or if the laws of England and Scotland happen to be at variance, what is to be done ? And, 2d, Is the kingdom of Scotland to be regarded as a common fief, and is the succession to the crown to be regulated by thc same principles"], [108, "1292. 92 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. which apply to earldoms and baronies ? The commis sioners replied, that the laws and usages of the two kingdoms must rule the question ; but if none exist ed applicable to the case, the king must make a new law for a new emergency ; and that the succession to the Scottish crown must be decided in the same man ner as the succession to earldoms, baronies, and other indivisible inheritances. The king then addressed himself to Bruce and Baliol, and required them to allege any further arguments in explanation of their right ; upon which they entered at great length into their respective pleadings upon the question. Bruce insisted, that Alexander the Second had de clared to persons yet alive, that he was next heir to the crown, when the king despaired of having heirs of his own body ; and that an oath had been taken by the people of Scotland to maintain the succession of the nearest in blood to Alexander the Third, fail ing the Maid of Norway and her issue. He main tained, that a succession to a kingdom ought to be decided by the law of nature, rather than by the principles which regulated the succession of vassals and subjects ; by which law, he, as nearest to the royal blood, ought to be preferred ; and that the cus tom of succession to the Scottish crown, by which the brother, as nearest in degree, excluded the son of the deceased monarch, supported his title. He contend ed that a woman, being naturally incapable of go vernment, ought not to reign ; and, therefore, as De vorguilla, the mother of Baliol, was alive at the death of Alexander the Third, and could not reign, the"], [109, "1292. MARGARET. 93 kingdom devolved upon him, as the nearest male of the blood royal. To all this Baliol replied, that as Alexander the Second had left heirs of his body, no conclusion could he drawn from his declaration ; that the claimants were in the court of their Lord Paramount, of whose ancestors, from time immemorial, the realm of Scot land was held by homage ; and that the King of England must give judgment in this case as in the case of other tenements held of the crown, looking to the law and established usages of his kingdom ; that, upon these principles, the eldest female heir is prefer red in the succession to all inheritance, indivisible as well as divisible, so that the issue of a younger sister, although nearer in degree, did not exclude the issue of the elder, though in a degree more remote, the succession continuing in the direct line. He main tained, that the argument of Bruce, as to the ancient laws of succession in the kingdom of Scotland, truly militated against himself; for the son was nearer in degree than the brother, yet the brother was prefer red. He observed, that Bruce's argument, that a woman ought not to reign, was inconsistent with his own claim ; for if Isabella, the mother of Bruce, had no right to reign, she could transmit to him no claim to the crown ; and besides all this, he had, by his own deliberate act, confuted the argument which he now maintained, having been one of those nobles who swore allegiance to Margaret, the Maiden of Nor way. The competitors, Bruce and Baliol, having thus ad-"], [110, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1292. 94 vanced their claims, King Edward required of his great council a final answer to the following question, solemnly exhorting the bishops, prelates, earls, barons, and commissioners, to advise well upon the point : \u2014 \" By the laws and customs of both kingdoms, ought the issue of an elder sister, but more remote by one degree, to exclude the issue of the younger sister, al though one degree nearer ?\" To this the whole coun cil unanimously answered, that the issue of the elder sister must be preferred ; upon which Edward, after affectedly entreating his council to reconsider the whole cause, adjourned the assembly for three weeks, and appointed it to meet again on Thursday the 6th of November. On this important day, in a full meet ing of all the competitors, the commissioners, and the assembled nobility of both countries, the king de clared, that, after weighing Bruce's petition, with all its circumstances, and deeply considering the argu ments on both sides, it was his final judgment, that the pretensions of that noble person to the Scottish crown must be set aside, and that he could take nothing in the competition with Baliol. The great drama, however, was not yet concluded ; for the king having ordered the claims of Baliol, and the other competitors which were only postponed, to be further heard, Bruce declared, that he meant to prosecute his right, and to present a claim for the whole or a part of the kingdom of Scotland, under a different form from what he had already followed. Upon this, John de Hastings, the descendant of the third daughter of David, Earl of Huntingdon, stood up, and affirmed"], [111, "1292. MARGARET. 95 that the kingdom of Scotland was partible, and ought, according to the established laws of England as to partible fiefs, to be divided equally amongst the de scendants of the three daughters. This plea was founded upon an opinion of one of the French law yers, whom Edward had consulted ; and Hastings had no sooner concluded, than Bruce again presented himself, and, adopting the argument of Hastings, claimed a third part of Scotland, reserving always to Baliol, as descended from the eldest sister, the name of king, and the royal dignity. Edward then put the question to his council, \" Is the kingdom of Scotland divisible ; or, if not, are its escheats or its revenues divisible ?\" The council answered, \" That neither could be divided.\" Upon which, the king, after ha ving taken a fevi days more to re-examine diligently, with the assistance of his council, the whole of the petitions, appointed the last meeting for the hearing of the cause to be held in the castle of Berwick, on the 17th of November. On that great and important day, the council and parliament of England, with the nobility of both coun tries, being met, the various competitors were sum moned to attend ; upon which, Eric, King of Norway, Florence, Earl of Holland, and William de Vescy, withdrew their claims. After this, Patrick, Earl of March, William de Ross, Robert de Pynkeny, Nicolas de Soulis, and Patrick Galythly, came forward in per son, and followed the same course. John Comyn and Roger de Mandeville, who did not appear, were pre sumed to have abandoned their right ; and the ground"], [112, "96 1292. HTSTORY OF SCOTLAND. being thus cleared for Edward's fiual judgment, he solemnly decreed, that as the kingdom of Scotland was indivisible, and as the King of England must judge of the rights of his subjects according to the laws and usages of the people over whom he reigns, by which laws the more remote in degree of the first line of descent is preferable to the nearer in degree of the second ; therefore, John Baliol shall have seisin of the kingdom of Scotland, with reservation always of the right of the King of England, and of his heirs, when they shall think proper to assert it. After ha ving delivered judgment, Edward exhorted Baliol to be careful in the government of his people, lest by giving to any one a just cause of complaint, he should call down upon himself an interference of his Lord Paramount. He commanded the five regents to give him seisin of his kingdom, and directed orders to the governors of the castles throughout Scotland, to de liver them into the hands of Baliol.1 A degrading 1 Rymer's F\u0153dera, vol. ii. p. 590.

The great seal of Scot land, which had been used by the regents since the death of Alexander the Third, was, in the presence of Edward, Baliol, Bruce, and a great concourse of the nobility of both kingdoms, broken into four parts, and the pieces deposited in the treasury of the King of England, to be preserved as an evidence of the pretended sovereignty and direct dominion of that kingdom over Scotland.1 Next day Baliol swore fealty to Edward in the Castle of Norham, who gave a commission to John de St John to perform the ce remony of his coronation, by placing the new monarch upon the ancient stone seat of Scone. This ought to have been done by Duncan, Earl of Fife, but he was then a minor, and in the custody of Edward. Baliol was accordingly crowned upon St Andrew's day, and soon after, he passed into England, and concluded the last act of this degrading history, by paying his ho mage to Edward at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, on the day after Christmas.2 Forts.

Baliol had scarce taken possession of his kingdom, when an event occurred which recalled him to a sense of his miserable subjection, and brought out the cha racter of Edward in all its insolent severity. It had been a special provision of the treaty of Brigham, that no Scottish subject was to be compelled to an swer in any criminal or civil suit, out of the bounds of the kingdom of Scotland ; but, in the face of this provision, Roger Bartholomew, a citizen of Berwick, entered an appeal to the court of the King of Eng land, from a judgment of those regents which he had appointed in Scotland during the interregnum.

He then, with that apparent air of justice and impartiality which he often threw over his worst aggressions, required the opinion of some of the ablest Scottish prelates and judges, with re gard to the law and custom of their kingdom in one of the cases brought before him, and commanded his council to decide according to the opinion which they delivered.2 Irritated, however, by his being reminded of the treaty of Brigham, he openly declared, by his justiciary Brabason, that although, during the va cancy of the kingdom of Scotland, he had been indu ced to make promises which suited the time, now when the nation was ruled by a king, he did not in tend to be bound by them, to the effect of excluding complaints brought before him from that kingdom, or of preventing him from dispensing justice, and ex ercising the rights of his sovereign dominion, accord ing to his power and pleasure. To give the greater 1 Rymer, vol. ii. p. 596. 8 Ryley's Placita, p. 145. Ridpath's Border History, pp. 185, 186."], [117, "1292. JOHN BALIOL. 101 weight to this imperious and shameless declaration, the King of England summoned Baliol and his prin cipal prelates and nobles into his own royal chamber at Newcastle, and there made Brabason repeat his resolutions upon the matter in question ; after which, Edward himself rose up, and, in the French language, spoke to the same tenor. \"These are my firm deter minations,\" said he, \" with regard to all complaints or appeals brought before me from Scotland ; nor will I be bound by any former promises or concessions made to the contrary. I am little careful by what deeds or instruments they may be ratified ; I shall exercise that superiority and direct dominion which I hold over the kingdom of Scotland, when and where I please ; nor will I hesitate, if necessary, to summon the King of Scotland himself into my presence within the kingdom of England.1 Baliol's spirit sunk under this haughty declaration, and he and the Scottish nobility who were then in his train, pusillanimously consented to buy their peace with Edward, by a solemn renunciation of all those stipulations and promises regarding the laws and liberties of Scotland, which had been made in the treaty of Brigham, and which, so long as they continued in force, convicted the King of England of the most flagrant disregard of his oath solemnly pledged to Scotland. On this being agreed to, Ed ward ordered the public records and ancient historical muniments of the kingdom, which had formerly been 1 Rymer's F\u0153d. vol. ii. p. 597. Tyrrel's England, vol. iii. p. 71."], [118, "102 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1292. transmitted from Edinburgh to Roxburgh, to be de livered to the King of Scotland. He also, out of special favour, commanded seisin of the Isle of Man to be given to him,1 and, softened by these concessions, Baliol returned to his kingdom. But it was only to experience fresh mortification, and to feel all the mi series of subjection and vassalage. The policy of Edward towards Scotland and its new king, was at once artful and insulting. He treated every assumption of independent sovereignty with rigour and contempt, and lost no opportunity of summoning Baliol to answer before him to the com plaints brought against him ; he encouraged his sub jects to bring these complaints by scrupulously admi nistering justice according to the laws and customs of Scotland ; and he distributed lands, pensions, and pre sents, with well-judged munificence amongst the pre lates and the nobility. Baliol had large estates both in England and Normandy, and in all the rights and privileges connected with them, he found Edward certainly not a severe, almost an indulgent superior. To Baliol the vassal, he was uniformly lenient and just.2 To Baliol the king, he was proud and unbend ing to the last degree. An example of this soon oc curred. The Earl of Fife died, leaving his son Duncan a minor, and his earldom under the protection of the 1 Edward, in 1290, when Margaret was alive, had taken under his protection her kingdom of Man, at the request of its inhabitants.

He was dispossessed by the bishop, and, on complaining to Edward, was, at the king's command, restored to his estates by a sentence of the Scottish regents. When Baliol held his first parliament at Scone, Macduff was summon ed to answer for his having taken forcible possession of lands, which, since the death of the last Earl of Fife, were in the custody of the king. He attempt ed a defence, but was found guilty, and suffered a short imprisonment. On his release, he carried his appeal to the King of England, and Edward imme diately summoned Baliol to answer in person before him, to the allegations of Macduff.1 To this order Baliol paid no regard, and Edward again commanded him to appear. This was not all. He procured his parliament to pass some regulations regarding the at tendance of the King of Scots, which, from their harshness and severity, seem to have been expressly intended to hurt and exasperate, and Baliol found that in every case of appeal he was not only to be dragged in as a party, but that his personal at tendance was to be rigidly exacted. The first was a grievous, the last an intolerable burden, to which no one with even the name of a king could long submit.2 Meanwhile, dissembling his chagrin, he appeared in the parliament held after Michaelmas, where Macduff 1 Rymer's F\u0153dera, vol. ii. p. 606.

When the cause of this Scottish noble came on, Baliol was asked what defence he had to offer. \" I am,\" said he, \" the King of Scotland.

This Baliol peremptorily declined, de claring that he would neither name a day, nor con sent to an adjournment. Upon this the English Par liament proceeded to pronounce judgment, and decla red that the King of Scotland, having offered no de fence, having made a reply which went to elude and weaken the jurisdiction of his liege lord, in whose court as a vassal he had claimed the crown of Scot land, was guilty of manifest and open contempt and disobedience, in consequence of which the parliament advised the King of England, not only to do full jus tice to Macduff, and to award damages against Baliol, but as a punishment for his feudal delinquency, to seize three of his principal castles in Scotland, to re main in the hands of the English monarch until he should make satisfaction for his contempt and disohc-"], [121, "1293. 105 JOHN BALIOL. dience.1 Before this judgment of the parliament was publicly made known, Baliol presented himself to Edward, and thus addressed him : \u2014 \" My lord, I am your liegeman for the kingdom of Scotland, and I entreat you, that as the matters wherewith you now are occupied concern the people of my kingdom no less than myself, you will delay their consideration until I have consulted with them, lest I be surprised from want of advice ; and this the more especially, as those now with me neither will, nor dare give me their opinion, without consulting with the Estates of the kingdom. After having advised with them, I will, in your first parliament after Easter, report the result, and perform what is my duty.\" It was evident that the resolutions of the parlia ment were unnecessarily violent, and could not have been carried into effect without the presence of an army in Scotland. The King of England aware of this, and dreading to excite a rebellion, for which he was not then prepared, listened to the demand of Baliol, and delayed all proceedings until the day after the Feast of the Trinity, in 1294.2 Not long after this, Edward, who was a vassal of the King of France for the duchy of Aquitaine, be came involved with his lord superior, in a quarrel si milar to that between himself and Baliol. A fleet of English vessels belonging to the Cinque Ports, had encountered and plundered some French merchant 1 Prynne's Edward I , p. 554. 2 Ridpath's Border History, p. 189.

As he dreaded a war with France, Edward proposed to investigate, by com missioners, the causes of quarrel ; but this seemed greatly too slow a process to the irritated feelings of the French King, and, exerting his rights as lord superior, he proudly summoned Edward to appear in his court at Paris, and there answer, as his vassal, for the injuries which he had committed. This order was, of course, little heeded ; upon which Philip, sit ting on his throne, gave sentence against the English king, pronounced him contumacious, and directed his territories in France to be seized, as forfeited to the crown.1 Edward soon after renounced his allegiance as a vassal of Philip, and, with the advice of his par liament, declared war against France. To assist him in this war, he summoned Baliol, and others of the most powerful of the Scottish nobles, to attend him in person with their armed vassals ; but his insolent and overbearing conduct had entirely disgusted the Scots. They treated his summons with scorn, and instead of arming their vassals for his assistance, they assembled a parliament at Scone. Its first step was, under the pretence of diminishing the pub lic charges, to dismiss all Englishmen from Baliol's court ; and having thus got rid of such trouble some spies upon their measures, they engaged in a treaty of alliance with France,2 and determined upon. 1 Tyrrel's England, vol. iii. p. 79.

Many estates in Scotland were at this time held by English barons, and many also of the most powerful of the Scottish nobility possess ed lands in England. Anxious for a general union against the common enemy, the Scottish estates in the hands of English barons were forfeited, and their proprietors banished, while those Scottish nobles who remained faithful to Edward had their lands seized and forfeited.1 In this way Robert Bruce lost his rich lordship of Annandale. It was given to John Comyn, Earl of Buchan, who instantly assumed the rights of a pro prietor, and took possession of its Castle of Lochmaben \u2014 an injury which in that fierce age could never be for gotten. Edward, although enraged at the conduct of the Scottish Parliament, and meditating a deep re venge, was at this time harassed by a rebellion of the Welsh, and a war with France. Dissimulation and policy were the weapons to which he had recourse, whilst he employed the interval which he gained in sowing dissension among the Scottish nobles, and col lecting an army for the punishment of their rebellion. To Bruce, the son of the competitor for the crown, whose mind was irritated by the recent forfeiture of his estates, he affected uncommon friendship, regretted his decision in favour of the now rebellious Baliol, decla red his determination to make him king, and direct ed him to inform his numerous and powerful friends in 1 Hemingford, p. 83, vol. i.

Besides this, Comyn, Earl of Buchan, who now main ly directed the Scottish councils, was his enemy, and held violent possession of his lordship of Annandale. To join with him was impossible; and accordingly this powerful baron and his son, afterwards king, with Dunbar, Earl of March, and Umfraville, Earl of Angus, repaired to Edward, and solemnly renewed to him their oaths of homage.2 The weak and undeci ded character of Baliol was ill calculated to remove this disunion amongst the Scottish nobles ; and the party who then ruled in the Scottish parliament, dreading a submission upon the part of their king, se cluded him from all power, confined him in a strong mountain fortress, and placed the management of af fairs in the hands of twelve of the leading nobles.* The measures adopted by these guardians were de cided and spirited. They, in the name of Baliol, drew up an instrument, renouncing all fealty and allegiance to Edward, on account of the manifold and grievous injuries committed upon his rights and property as King of Scotland.4 They dispatched ambassadors to France, who concluded a treaty of marriage and alliance, by which the niece of Philip, daughter of the Count of Anjou, was to be united to the eldest son of Baliol \u2014 the French king enga- 1 Fordun a Hearne, p. 971. - Hemingford, vol. i. p. 102. 3 Math.

Indeed, nothing could be more favourable for Edward than the miserably disunited state of Scotland. He knew that three powerful fac tions divided the country, and hindered that firm po litical union, without which, against such an enemy, no successful opposition could be made. Bruce, and his numerous and powerful followers, adhered to Eng land. The friends of Baliol, and that part of the na tion which recognised him for their lawful sovereign, beheld him a captive in one of his own fortresses, and refused to join the rebels who had imprisoned him ; and the party of Comyn, which had invaded England, were either so destitute of military talent, or so divi ded amongst themselves, that a handful of the citi zens of Carlisle compelled them to retreat with loss into their own country. These advantages, the re sult of his own able and insidious policy, were easily perceived by the King of England. It was now his time for action, and for inflicting that vengeance upon his enemies, which, with this monarch, the longer it was delayed, was generally the more sure and terrible. He assembled a numerous and well-appoint ed army. It consisted of thirty thousand foot, and 1 Hemingford, p. 87. Ridpath, p. 194. Trivet, p. 288."], [126, "1296. 110 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. four thousand heavy-armed horse. He was joined by the warlike Bishop of Durham, at the head of a thousand foot and five hundred horse ; and with this .combined force, and the two sacred banners of St John of Beverly and St Cuthbert of Durham carried before the army,1 he marched towards Scotland. It appears, that some time before this, Edward had thought pro per to grant a prolongation of the term agreed on for the decision of the question of Macduff, and had re quired Baliol to attend him as his vassal at Newcas tle-upon-Tyne.3 On arriving there, he summoned the King of Scotland ; and after waiting a few days for his appearance, advanced to the eastern border, and crossed the Tweed with his main army below the Nunnery of Coldstream. On the same day the Bi shop of Durham forded the river at Norham, and the whole army, marching along the Scottish side, came before the town of Berwick, then in the hands of the Scots.3 Edward was determined to make himself master of this devoted city.

The king summoned it to surrender, and offered it terms of accommodation, which, after two days' consideration, were refused. Edward, upon this, did not immediately proceed to storm, but drew back his army to a field near a nun nery, about a mile from the town, and where, from the lying of the ground, he could more easily conceal his dispositions for the attack. He then dispatched a large division, with orders to assault the town by a line of march which concealed them from the citizens ; and he commanded his fleet to enter the river at the same moment that the great body of the army, led by himself, were ready to storm.2 The Scottish garrison fiercely assaulted the ships, burnt three of them, and compelled the rest to retire ;3 but they, in their turn, were driven back by the fury of the land attack.

All the horrors of a rich and populous city sacked by an inflamed soldiery, and a commander thirsting for vengeance, now suc ceeded. Seventeen thousand persons,1 without dis tinction of age or sex, were put to the sword ; for two days the city ran with blood like a river \u2014 none were spared. The churches, to which the miserahle inha bitants had fled for sanctuary, were violated, and defi led with blood, spoiled of their sacred ornaments, and turned into stables for the English cavalry.2 In the midst of this massacre a fine trait of fidelity occurred. The Flemings at this period carried on a lucrative and extensive trade with Scotland, and their principal factory was established in Berwick. It was a strong building, called the Red-hall, and they were bound to defend it to the last extremity against the English. True to their engagements, thirty of these brave merchants held out the place against the whole English army. Night came, and still it was not ta ken. Irritated by this obstinate courage, the English set it on fire, and buried its faithful defenders in the burning ruins.3 The massacre of Berwick, which took place on Good Friday, was a terrible example of the vengeance which Edward was ready to inflict upon his enemies. Its plunder enriched his army, and it never recovered its commercial importance and pros perity. Sir William Douglas, who commanded the 1 Knighton, p. 2480. * Fordun, b. xi. c. 54, 55.

Wherefore, I renounce that fealty and homage, which have been extorted from me, and do resolve openly to oppose myself, in defence of my kingdom, against Edward of Eng land.\"2 Edward received this letter with angry contempt. \" The senseless traitor !\" said he ; \" of what folly is he guilty !

Enraged at the dreadful vengeance inflicted on Berwick, the Scottish army, under the Earls of Ross, Menteith, and Athol, made a second inroad into Eng land, and, imitating the example of Edward, with merciless severity ravaged Redesdale and Tindale, carrying away a great booty, and sparing neither sex nor age.1 The flames of towns and villages, and the ashes of the ancient monasteries of Lanercost and Hexham, marked their destructive progress ; but the vengeance of the Scots was shortlived, and their plans unconnected. That of their enemy was the very opposite ; it was deep-laid in its plans, simul taneous in its movements, and remorseless in its con templation of consequences. The castle of Dunbar was at this time one of the strongest, and, by its situation, most important in Scot land. Its lord, Patrick, Earl of Dunbar, served in the army of Edward ; but his wife, the Countess, who held the castle, and hated the English, entered into a secret negotiation with the Scottish leaders, for its delivery into the hands of her countrymen. The Earls of Ross, Athol, and Menteith, the Barons John Comyn, William St Clair, Richard Seward, and John de Mowbray, with thirty-one knights, and a strong force, threw themselves into the place, and, assisted by the Countess, easily expelled the few soldiers who remained faithful to England.2 On being informed of 1 Rymer, vol. ii. p. 887.

JOHN BALIOL. 115 this loss, Edward determined upon recovering it at all hazards, and for this purpose dispatched the Earl of Surrey with ten thousand foot, and a thousand heavy- armed horse. When summoned by Warrene, the gar- rison agreed to surrender, unless relieved within three days ; and the Scots, anxious to retain so important a place, led on the whole of their army, and possessed themselves of a strong and excellent position on the high ground above Dunbar. Forty thousand foot, and five thousand horse, encamped on the heights, near Spot ; and, confident of rescue, the garrison of the castle insulted the English from the walls, as if al- ready beaten. Surrey, on the first appearance of the Scottish army, steadily advanced to attack it. On ap- proaching the high ground, it was necessary to deploy through a valley ; and in executing this movement, the Scots observed, or imagined they observed, some confusion in the English ranks. Mistaking this for flight, they precipitately abandoned their strong po- sition on the hills, and rushed down with dreadful shouts upon the enemy. Meanwhile, before the lines could meet, the English earl had extricated himself from the valley, and formed into compact order. The Scots, ruined, as they had often been by their teme- rity, perceived their fatal error when it was too late. Instead of an enemy in flight, they found an army under perfect discipline, advancing upon their bro- ken and disordered columns ; and having in vain en deavoured to regain their ranks, after a short resist ance they were completely routed. Three hundred and fifty years after this, Cromwell, on thc same"], [132, "1296. 116 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. ground, defeated the army of the Scottish Covenanters, which occupied exactly the same admirable position, and with equal folly and precipitancy deserted it. Sur rey's victory was complete, and for the time decided the fate of Scotland. Ten thousand men fell on the field, or in the pursuit. Sir Patrick de Graham, a valiant knight, and \" noble among the noblest,\" disdained to ask for quarter, and was slain in circumstances which extorted the praise of the enemy.1 A great multitude, including the principal of the Scottish nobility, were taken prisoners ; and, next day, the King of England coming in person with the rest of his army before Dunbar, the castle surrendered at discretion. The Earls of Athol, Ross, and Menteith, with four barons, seventy knights, and many brave esquires, submitted to the mercy of the conqueror. All the prisoners of rank were immediately sent in chains to England, where they were for the present committed to close confinement in different Welsh and English castles.2 After some time, the king com pelled them to attend him in his wars in France ; but even this partial liberty was not allowed them, till their sons were delivered into his hands as hos tages.3 Edward was not slow to follow up the advantages which this important success had given him.

It was at his instigation that lngeram de Umfraville surrendered the castle of Dumbarton,2 and gave up his daughters, Eva and Isobel, as hostages. Soon after, the strength of Jed burgh was yielded to his mercy,3 and his victorious army being reinforced by a body of fifteen thousand men from Wales, he was enabled to send home that part of his English force, which had suffered most from fatigue in this expedition. With these fresh le vies he advanced to Edinburgh, made himself master of the castle after a siege of eight days,4 passed rapidly to Stirling, which he found abandoned ; aud while there, the Earl of Ulster, with a new army of thirty thousand foot and four hundred horse, came to join the king, and complete the triumph of the English arms. Edward continued his progress without opposi tion to Perth, where he halted to keep the feast of the nativity of John the Baptist, with circumstances of high feudal pomp and solemnity, feasting his friends, creating new knights, and solacing himself and his barons.

This determination was none other thau that of an absolute and unconditional resignation of him self and his kingdom to the will and mercy of his conqueror; to which Baliol, who was now the mere shadow of a king, without a crown, an army, or a no bility, dejectedly and patiently submitted. In pre sence of the Bishop of Durham, and the barons of England, stript of his regal ornaments, and standing as a criminal, with a white rod in his hand, he per formed a most humiliating feudal penance. He con fessed, that, misled by evil counsel and his own weak ness, he had grievously offended his liege lord ; he recapitulated his various transgressions, his league with France, and his hostilities against England ; he acknowledged the justice of the invasion of his king dom by Edward, in vindication of his violated rights ; and three days after this, in the castle of Brechin, he resigned his kingdom of Scotland, its people, and their homage, into the hands of his liege lord Edward, of his own free will and consent.2 After this humiliating ceremony, Baliol delivered his eldest son, Edward, to the King of England, as a hostage for his future fide- 1 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 98. - Prynne's Edward I. pp. 650, 651 .

Thus ended the miserable and inglorious reign of John Baliol, a prince whose good dispositions might have insured him a happier fate, had he been opposed to a less terrible and ambitious enemy than Edward the First ; or had the courage and spirit, in which he was not deficient, been seconded by the efforts of a brave and united nobility. But Edward, with a po licy not dissimilar to that which we have adopted in our Eastern dominions, had succeeded in preventing all union amongst the most powerful Scottish barons, by arraying their private and selfish ambition against their love of their country ; by sowing dissension in their councils, richly rewarding their treachery, and treating with unmitigated severity those who dared to love and defend the liberty of Scotland ; and Baliol's character was not of that high stamp, which could unite such base and discordant materials, or baffle a policy so deep, and a power so overwhelming. 1 Langtoft, Chron. vol. ii. p. 280.

The spirit of the Scottish people was for the time completely broken, and Edward, as he continued his expedition from Perth to Aberdeen, and from thence to Elgin in Murray, did not experience a single check in his progress ; while most of the Scottish barons, who had escaped death or imprisonment, crowded in to renounce the French alliance, and renew their oaths of fealty. On his return from the north to hold his parliament at Berwick, in passing the ancient cathe dral of Scone, he took with him the famous and fatal stone chair, in which for many ages the Scottish kings had been crowned and anointed. This, considered by the Scots as their national palladium, along with the Scottish sceptre and crown, the English monarch placed in the cathedral of Westminster, as an offer ing to Edward the Confessor, and a memorial of what he deemed his absolute conquest of Scotland ; ' a con quest, however, which, before a single year had elapsed, was entirely wrested from his hands. Edward was desirous of annihilating everything which could pre serve the patriotic feeling of the country which he had overrun. With this object, when at Scone, he mutilated the ancient chartulary of that abbey, the historical notices in which were perhaps fatal to his pretended claim of superiority, carrying off some of its charters, and tearing the seals. Our historians af- 1 Fordun a Goodal, B. xi. c. 25. Hemingford, vol. i. p. 37. p. VJiK"], [137, "1296. JOHN BALIOL. 121 firm, that in his progress he industriously sought out and destroyed every monument connected with the antiquity and independence of the nation. The cha racter of Edward, and his conduct at Scone, give the greatest probability to the truth of the assertion.1 On the 28th of August, the king held his parlia ment at Berwick, for the purpose of receiving the fealty of the clergy and laity of Scotland. Multi tudes of Scotchmen of all ranks resorted to him \u2014 earls, barons, knights, and esquires. The terror of his arms, the well-known severity of his temper, which made imprisonment and the immediate confiscation of their estates the consequence of their refusal, the ex ample of their nobility, who now felt, too late for re medy, the sad effect of their dissensions, all combined to render this submission to Edward a measure as unanimous as it was humiliating ; and the oaths of homage, the renunciation of the French alliance, and the names of the vassals, which fill thirty-five skins of parchment, are still preserved amongst the Eng lish archives.2 After the battle of Dunbar, Bruce, Earl of Carrie, who was then in the service of Eng land, reminded Edward of his promise to place him on the throne. \" Have I nothing to do,\" said the haughty monarch, \" but to conquer kingdoms for you ?\" Judging it probably a more befitting occupa tion, the King of England empowered the Earl of Carrie and his son, the younger Bruce, to receive 1 Innes' Critical Essay on the Ancient Inhabitants of Scotland, pp. 554, 555.

Edward next directed his attention to the settle ment of his new dominions ; and the measures which he adopted for this purpose were equally politic and just. He commanded the sheriffs of the several coun ties in Scotland, to restore to the clergy their forfeit ed lands, and he granted to the Scottish bishops for ever, the privilege of bequeathing their effects by will, as fully as the right was enjoyed by the prelates of England. The widows of those barons whose hus bands had died before the French alliance, and who had not since then been married to the king's ene mies, were faithfully restored to their estates ; but, effectually to secure their allegiance, the English Guardian of Scotland was permitted, at his option, to take possession of the castles and strengths upon their lands. He even assigned pensions to the wives of many of his Scottish prisoners ; and few of those who held office under the unfortunate Baliol were dis possessed. The jurisdictions of Scotland were suffered to remain with those who possessed them,under ancient and hereditary titles ; no wanton or unnecessary act of rigour was committed, no capricious changes intro duced, yet all means were adopted to give security to 1 Rymer, Feed. vol. ii. p. 714."], [139, "1296. 123 PERIOD OF WALLACE. his conquest. John Warrene, Earl of Surrey, was made Guardian of Scotland, Hugh de Cressing ham, Treasurer, and William Ormesby, Justiciary. Henry de Percy, nephew of Warrene, was appointed keeper of the county of Galloway and the sheriffdom of Ayr ; the castles of Roxburgh, Berwick, Jedburgh, and Edinburgh, were committed to English captains ; a new seal, in place of the ancient Great Seal of Scot land, surrendered by Baliol, and broken into pieces at Brechin, was placed in the hands of Walter de Ag mondesham, an English Chancellor, and an Exche quer for receiving the king's rents and taxes was in stituted at Berwick, on the model of that at West minster.1 PERIOD OF WALLACE. Edward had scarcely made this settlement of Scot land, and set out for his own dominions, when he found, that instead of the acclamations due to a conqueror, he was to be received at home with the lowering coun tenances of discontent and rebellion. He had incur red a heavy expense in his Scottish expedition, and he was now anxious to carry on with vigour his war with Fiance ; but the clergy of England, headed by a proud and firm prelate, Winchelsy, Archbishop of Canterbury, demurred as to the supplies which he de manded ; and a powerful party of the barons, led by 1 Madox, Hist, of Exchequer, p. 550.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. the Constable and the Marshal of England, refused to pass over into France, and indignantly retired from Parliament, with a great body of their armed re tainers. These discontents in England encouraged the peo ple of Scotland to rise against their English oppres sors. Although deserted by their nobility, a spirit of determined hatred against England, was strongly ma nifested by the great body of the nation. Through out the whole country, numerous bands of armed pea sants infested the highways, and in contempt of go vernment plundered the English, and laid waste their lands. Their numbers increased, and their successes soon became alarming. They besieged the castles garrisoned by the English, took prisoners, committed all kinds of rapine and homicide ; and the impression made upon the mind of Edward, may be judged of by a letter still remaining, addressed to his treasurer, Cressingham, commanding him not to scruple to spend the whole money in his exchequer to put down these violent disorders.1 The patriotic principle which seems at this time to have entirely deserted the highest ranks of the Scottish nobles, whose mean and selfish dissensions had brought ruin and bondage upon their country, still burned pure in the breasts of these broken men and rebels, as they are termed by Edward.

This was William Wallace, or Walays, the second son of Sir Malcolm Wallace of Ellerslie, near Pais ley, a simple knight, whose family was ancient, but neither rich nor noble.1 In those days bodily strength and knightly prowess were of the highest consequence in commanding respect and ensuring success. Wal lace had an iron frame. His make, as he grew up to manhood, approached almost to the gigantic, and his personal strength was superior to the common run of even the strongest men. His passions were hasty and violent ; a strong hatred to the English, who now in solently lorded it over Scotland, began to show itself at a very early period of his life ; and this aversion was fostered in the youth by an uncle, a priest, who, deploring the calamities of his country, was never weary of extolling the sweets of liberty and the mi series of dependence.2 The state of national feeling in Scotland, at this time, has been already described ; and it is evident, that the repressing of a rising spirit of resistance, 1 Wynton's Chron. B. viii. chap. 13. Fordun a Goodal. vol. ii. p. 169.

Upon the part of the English, all this was wanting. Warrene, the governor, had, on account of ill health, retired to the north of England. Cres singham, the treasurer, was a proud, ignorant eccle siastic : Edward, before he departed, had left orders that all who had not yet taken the oath of fealty, in cluding not only the lesser barons, but the burghers and inferior gentry, should be compelled to do so un der severe penalties, exacted by military force; and Ormesby, the justiciary, had excited deep and gene ral odium, by the intolerable rigour with which these penalties were extorted. The intrepid temper of Wallace appears first to have shown itself in a quarrel with one of the Eng lish officers, who insulted him. Provoked by his taunts, Wallace, reckless of the consequences, stabbed him with his dagger, and slew him on the spot.1 The consequence of this was to him the same as to many others, who at this time preferred a life of dangerous freedom to the indulgence and security of submission.2 He was proclaimed a traitor, banished his home, and driven to seek his safety in the wilds and fastnesses of his country. It was here that he collected by de grees a little band, composed at first of a few brave men of desperate fortunes, who had forsworn their vassalage to their lords, and refused submission to Edward, and who at first carried on that predatory 1 Wynton, B. 8. c. 13.

PERIOD OF WALLACE. 127 warfare against the English, to which they were im pelled as well by the desire of plunder, and the ne cessity of subsistence, as by the love of liberty. These men chose Wallace for their chief. Superior rank, for as yet none of the nobility or barons had joined them, his uncommon courage and personal strength, and his unconquerable thirst of vengeance against the Eng lish, naturally influenced their choice, and the result proved how well it had fallen. His plans were laid with so much judgment, that in his first attacks against straggling parties of the English, he was ge nerally successful; and if surprised by unexpected numbers, his superior strength and bravery, and the noble ardour with which he inspired his followers, enahled them to overpower every effort which was made against them. To him these early and desultory excursions against the enemy were highly useful, as he became acquaint ed with the strongest passes of his country, and ac quired habits of command over men of fierce and tur bulent spirits. To them the advantage was recipro cal, for they began gradually to feel an undoubting confidence in their leader ; they were accustomed to rapid marches, to endure fatigue and privation, to be on their guard against surprise, to feel the effects of discipline and obedience, and by the successes which these ensured, to regard with contempt the nation by whom they had allowed themselves to be overcome. The consequences of these partial advantages over the enemy were soon seen. At first few had dared to"], [144, "1297- 128 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. unite themselves to so desperate a band. But confi dence came with success, and numbers flocked to the standard of revolt. The continued oppressions of the English, the desire of revenge, and even the romantic and perilous nature of the undertaking, recruited the ranks of Wallace, and he was soon at the head of a great body of Scottish exiles.1 When it was known that this brave man had rai sed open banner against the English, Sir William Douglas,2 who had been taken by Edward at the siege of Berwick, and restored to his liberty, upon swear ing fealty, disregarding his oath, joined the Scottish force with his whole vassals. Ormesby, the Eng lish Justiciary, was at this time holding his court at Scone, and Surrey, the Guardian, had gone to at tend the English Parliament. Wallace, by a rapid march surprised the Justiciary, dispersed his follow ers, and whilst he himself escaped with the greatest difficulty, took a rich booty and many prisoners.3 This exploit giving new confidence to their little army, they more openly and boldly ravaged the coun try, and put all Englishmen to the sword. As cir cumstances allowed, they either acted together, or en gaged in separate expeditions. Whilst Wallace 1 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 1 18.

PERIOD OF WALLACE. 129 marched into Lennox, the castles of Disdeir and San quhar were taken by Douglas, and when their united strength afterwards broke in upon the west of Scot land, they were joined by some of the most powerful of the Scottish nobility. The Steward of Scotland, and his brother, Sir Andrew Moray of Bothwell, Alexander de Lindesay, and Sir Richard Lundin, with a spirited prelate, Wishart, Bishop of Glasgow, were amongst the number.1 Their united forces, led by the military skill, and animated by the personal intrepidity of Wallace, con tinued to be successful in repeated attacks upon the English, and these successes were frequently followed, as was to be expected, by many circumstances of cruelty and violence. Their revenge seems especially to have been directed against the English ecclesias tics who were possessed of Scottish livings. A pub lic edict, passed by the Scottish Estates in 1296, had banished these intruders from Scotland, and this edict Wallace improved upon with a refinement in cruelty. The unhappy priests had their hands tied behind their backs, and in this helpless state were thrown from high bridges into rivers, their dying agonies affording sport to their merciless captors.2 The conduct of the younger Bruce, afterwards the heroic Robert the First, was at this eventful period exceedingly vacillating and inconsistent. His large possessions in Carrick and Annandale, made him 1 Hailes, vol. i. p. 246. 2 Hen. Knighton, p. 2514. apud Twysden, vol. i. VOL. I.

His power caused him to be narrowly watched by England ; and as his in constant character became suspected by the Wardens of the Western Marches, they summoned him to treat on the affairs of his master the king at Car lisle. Bruce, not daring to disobey, resorted thither with a numerous attendance of his friends and vas sals, and was compelled to make oath on the conse crated host, and the sword of Thomas-a-Becket, that he would continue faithful to the cause of Edward. To give a proof of his fidelity, he ravaged the estates of Sir William Douglas, then with Wallace, seized his wife and children, and carried them into Annan dale. Having thus defeated suspicion, and saved his lands, he assembled his father's vassals, talked lightly of an extorted oath, from which the Pope would ab solve him, and urged them to follow him, and join the brave men who had taken arms against the English. This, however, they refused, probably because their master and overlord, the elder Bruce, was then with Edward. Robert, however, nothing moved by the disappointment, collected his own vassals, marched to join Wallace, and openly took arms against the English.1 1 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 120. Knighton, p. 2514-"], [147, "1297. PERIOD OF WALLACE. 131 The news of this rebellion reached the King of England, as he was preparing to sail for Flanders. He at first disregarded it, and as many of the most powerful of the Scottish nobles were then either pri soners in England, or in attendance upon himself, and ready to embark for the continent, he was easily per suaded that it would be instantly put down by the authority of the governor. Anthony Beck, however, the martial Bishop of Durham, was dispatched in great haste into Scotland, and Edward, finding from his account, that the revolt was of a very serious nature, commanded the Earl of Surry to call forth the military force on the north of the Trent, and, without delay, to reduce the insurgents.1 This, how ever, was no easy matter.- Surry sent his nephew, Henry Percy, before him into Scotland, at the head of an army of forty thousand foot and three hundred armed horse. Percy marched through Annandale to Lochmaben, where, during the night, his encamp ment was suddenly surprised by the Scotch, and at tacked with great fury. It was very dark, and Percy's men knew not where to rally. In this emergency they set fire to the wooden houses, where they Jay, and guided to their banners by the blaze, repulsed the enemy, and marched towards Ayr,2 for the pur pose of receiving the men of Galway to the peace of the king, It was here told them that the Scottish army was not four miles distant ; and Percy, having 1 Hemingford, p. 122.

This force, which equalled the Eng lish in foot, although inferior in horse, was sufficient, under able conduct, to have given battle to Percy, but it was enfeebled by dissension amongst its lead ers ; and although Wallace was there to direct them, the pride of these feudal barons would not submit to be commanded by him. Accordingly, most of these chiefs became anxious to negotiate terms for them selves, and to save their lands. Sir Richard Lundin, a Scottish knight, who had till now refused allegiance to Edward, went over with his followers to the army of Percy, declaring it to be folly to remain longer with a party at variance with itself. Bruce, the Steward of Scotland, and his brother, Alexander de Lindesay, Sir William Douglas, and the Bishop of Glasgow, made submission to Edward, and entreated his forgiveness for the robberies and slaughters which they had committed. An instrument, commemora ing this desertion of their country, to which their seals were appended, was drawn up in Norman French, and a copy transmitted to Wallace j1 but this brave man treated it with high disdain. Although the greater nobles had deserted the cause, he knew that many of their vassals had enthusiastically attached themselves to his person and fortunes.2 He could 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, dated 9th July 1297, vol. ii. p. 774. 2 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 125."], [149, "1297. PERIOD OF WALLACE. 133 muster also a large body of his own tried and veteran followers, and putting himself at the head of these, he retired indignantly to the north. Sir Andrew Moray of Bothwell was the only baron who accompanied him. The conduct of the Scottish nobility, who had ca pitulated to Percy, was irresolute and contradictory. Edward had accepted their offers of submission ; but although they would not act in concert with Wallace, whose successes had now effectually raised the spirit of the nation, they drew back from their agreement with Percy, and delayed the delivery of their hosta ges, until security should be given them for the pre servation of the rights and liberties of their country. Sir William Douglas and the Bishop of Glasgow, however, considered that they were bound to abide by the capitulation signed at Irvine ; and finding them selves unable to perform their solemn articles of agree ment, they voluntarily surrendered to the English.1 It was the fate of this intriguing prelate > to be trusted by neither party. Wallace, whose passions were fiery and impetuous, loudly accused him of treachery, at tacked his castle, ravaged his lands, and led his family captive ; whilst the King of England declared that, under this surrender of himself at the castle of Rox burgh, he concealed the purpose of organizing a con spiracy for betraying that important fortress to the Scots.2 Notwithstanding the capitulation at Irvine; 1 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 124.

In Aberdeenshire the revolt was especially serious, and Edward direct ed his writs to the bishop and sheriffs of the county, commanding them to punish the rebels for the mur ders and robberies which they had heen committing, and to be on their guard against an intended attack upon the castle of Urquhart, then held by William de Warrene.1 What were the particular successes of Wallace and his brethren in arms, during the sum mer months, which elapsed between the treaty at Ir vine and the battle of Stirling, we have no authentic memorials to determine.2 That they had the effect of recruiting his army, and giving him the confidence of the whole of the vassalry of Scotland, is certain ; for Knighton, an old English historian, informs us, \" that the whole followers of the nobility had attach ed themselves to him, and that although the persons of their lords were with the King of England, their heart was with Wallace, who found his army rein forced by so immense a multitude of the Scotch, that the community of the land obeyed him as their leader and their prince.\"3 Edward, in the meantime, dis satisfied with the dilatory conduct of Surry, in not sooner putting down a revolt, which the king's ener getic and confident spirit caused him to treat too lightly, superseded him, and appointed Brian Fitz- 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, pp. 41, 42. vol. i. 2 From 9th July to 3d September, 3 Knighton apud Twysden, p. 2516."], [151, "1297. PERIOD OF WALLACE. 135 Alan governor of Scotland. At the same time he liberated, from their imprisonment, in various castles through England, the Scottish nobles and barons taken at the battle of Dunbar, and carried them along with him to Flanders. Their forfeited lands were restored ; but to secure their fidelity, the king compelled their eldest sons to remain in England as hostages.1 Others of the Scottish nobles, whose fide lity was less suspected, were permitted to return home, under a promise of assisting in the reduction and pa cification of the country ; and as many of the most powerful and warlike English barons as he could spare from his expedition to Flanders, were directed to re pair to Scotland, with all the horse and foot which they could muster, and to co-operate with Fitz-Alan and Surry.2 Having taken these precautions, King Edward passed over to Flanders on tbe twenty-se cond of August.3 It was fortunate for the Scots, that Warrene, thc Earl of Surry, evinced great remissness in insisting on the fulfilment of the treaty of Irvine. He was on bad terms with Cressiugham the Treasurer, a proud and violent churchman, who preferred the cuirass to the cassock ;* and it is probable, that his being su perseded in his government of Scotland, and yet com manded to remain with the army, was an indignity 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, pp. 44, 45.

The Scottish barons still delayed the delivery of their hostages, and cautiously awaited the event of the war, whilst Wallace, at the head of a powerful army, having succeeded in expelling the English from the castles of Forfar, Brechin, Montrose, and nearly all their strongholds on the north of the Forth, had just begun the siege of the castle of Dundee, when he received intelligence that the English army, under the command of the Earl of Surry, and Cressingham the Treasurer, was on its march to Stirling. Well ac quainted with the country there, his military skill taught him of what importance it would be to secure the high ground on the river Forth, above Cam bus-kenneth, before Surry had passed the bridge at Stirling ; and having commanded the citizens of Dundee, on pain of death, to continue the siege of the castle, he marched with great expedition, and found, to his satisfaction, that he had anticipated the English, so as to give him time to draw up his army before the columns of Cressingham and Surry had reached the other side of the river. The nature of the ground concealed the Scottish army, which amounted to forty thousand foot, and a hundred and eighty horse. Wallace's intention was to induce the main body of the English army to pass the bridge, and to attack them before they had time to form. 1 Rymer, vol. ii. p. 794,"], [153, "1297. PERIOD OF WALLACE. 137 Surry was superior in numbers. He commanded a body of fifty thousand foot soldiers, and a thousand armed horse. Lord Henry Percy had marched from Carlisle towards Stirling, with a reinforcement of eight thousand chosen foot and three hundred horse ; but Cressingham the Treasurer, dreading the expense of supporting so great a force, with an ill-judged eco nomy, had given orders for the disbanding these suc cours, as he considered the army in the field to be sufficient for the emergency.1 The Steward of Scot land, the Earl of Lennox, and others of the Scottish barons, were at this time with the English army, and on coming to Stirling, requested Surry to delay an attack till they had attempted to bring Wallace to terms. They soon returned, and declared that they had failed in their hopes of pacification, but that they themselves would join the English force with sixty armed horse. It was now evening, and the Scottish barons, in leaving the army, met a troop of English soldiers returning from forage. Whether from acci dent or design, a skirmish took place between these two bodies, and the Earl of Lennox stabbed an Eng lish soldier in the throat. This, of course, raised a tumult in the camp ; a cry rose that they were betray ed by the Scotch; and there can be little doubt that Lennox and his friends were secretly negotiating with Wallace, and only waited for a favourable opportunity of joining him. Crying out for vengeance, the English soldiers carried their wounded comrade before their ge- 1 Hemingford, p. 127"], [154, "138 1297. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. neral, and reproached him with having trusted those who had broken their faith, and would betray them to the enemy. \" Stay this one night,\" said he, \" and if to-morrow they do not keep their promise, you shall have ample revenge.\" He then commanded his sol diers to be ready to pass the bridge next day ; and thus, with a carelessness little worthy of an experien ced commander, who had the fate of a great army dependent on his activity and foresight, he permitted Wallace to tamper with his countrymen in the Eng lish service, to become acquainted with the numbers and array of the English force, and to adopt, at his leisure, his own measures for their discomfiture. Early next day, five thousand foot soldiers and a large body of Welshmen passed the bridge by sun rise, and soon after repassed it, on finding that they were not followed by the rest of the army, and that the Earl of Surry was still asleep in the camp. Af ter an hour the earl awoke, the army was drawn up, and as was then usual before any great battle, many new knights were created, some of whom were fated to die in their first field. It was now the time when the Scottish barons ought to have joined with their sixty horse, and Surry, having looked for them in vain, commanded the infantry to pass the bridge. This order was scarcely given when it was again re called, as the Steward of Scotland and the Earl of Lennox were seen approaching, and it was hoped, brought good news and offers of pacification. But the contrary was the case. They had failed, they said, in all their efforts to prevail on the Scottish"], [155, "1297. PERIOD OF WALLACE. 139 army to listen to any proposals, and had not been able to persuade a single horseman or foot soldier to desert. As a last resource, Surry, who seems to have been aware of the strong position occupied by the Scotch, and of the danger of passing the bridge, dispatched two friars to propose terms to Wallace, who made this memorable reply ; \u2014 \" Return to your friends, and tell them that we came here with no peaceful intent, but ready for battle, and determined to avenge our' own wrongs and set our country free. Let your masters come and attack us, we are ready to meet them beard to beard.\" 1 Incensed at this cool defiance, the English presumptuously and eagerly demanded to be led on. Upon which, Sir Richard Lundin, a Scottish knight, who had gone over to the enemy at Irvine, anxiously implored them to be still : \" If,\" said he, \" you once attempt to pass the bridge, you are desperately throw ing away your lives. The men can only pass two by two. Our enemies command our flank, and in an in stant will be upon us. I know a ford not far from hence where you may cross by sixty at a time. Give me but five hundred horse, and a small body of foot, I shall turn the enemy's flank, whilst you, lord earl, and the rest of the army, may pass over in perfect se curity.\" This was the sound advice of a veteran sol dier who knew the country ; but although it convin ced some, it only irritated others, and among these last, Hugh Cressingham the Treasurer. \" Why, my lord,\" cried he to Surry, who was prudently hesitating, 1 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 126."], [156, "140 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1297. \" why do we protract the war, and spend the king's money ? Let us pass on as becomes us, and do our knightly duty.\" J Stung with this reproach, Surry weakly submitted his better judgment to the rashness of this petulant churchman, and commanded the army to defile over the bridge. Sir Marmaduke Twenge, a knight of great experience and courage, along with Cressing ham himself, led the van, and when nearly the half of the army had passed the bridge, perceiving that the Scots kept their strong ground on the heights, Twenge, with chivalrous impetuosity, gave orders for a charge, and made the heavy-armed cavalry spur their horses up the hill. The consequence of this precipitate movement was fatal to the English. A part of the Scottish army had by this time made a detour and possessed themselves of the foot of the bridge,2 and Wallace, the moment that he saw the communication between the van and the rear of the English force thus cut off, and all retreat impossible, rushed rapidly down from the high ground, and attack ing Twenge and Cressingham, before they had time 1 \" Mirum dictu,\" exclaims Hemingford, in an animated reflec tion on the madness of Surry's conduct, \" sed terribile, quid in eventu, quod tot et tanti discreti viri dum scirent hostes impromptu, strictum pontem ascenderint, quod bini equestres, vix et cum diffi cultate simul transire potuerunt.\" Hemingford, vol. i. p. 128. 2 Hemingford, 128. \u2014 \" Descenderunt de monte, et missis viris lanceariis occupaverunt pedem pontis, ita quod extunc nulli patebat transitus vel regressus.\" See also Walsingham, p. 73."], [157, "1297. PERIOD OF WALLACE. 141 to form, threw them into inextricable disorder. In an instant all was tumult and confusion. Many were slain, multitudes of the heavy-armed horse plunged into the river, and were drowned in making a vain effort to rejoin Surry, who kept on the other side, a spectator of the discomfiture of the flower of his army. In the meantime, the standard-bearers of the king and of the earl, with another part of the army, passed over, and shared the fate of their companions, being instantly cut to pieces. A spirited and chi valrous scene now took place. Sir Marmaduke Twenge, on looking round, perceived that the Scotch had seized the bridge, and that he and his soldiers were cut off from the rest of the army. A knight advised, in this perilous crisis, that they should throw themselves into the river, and swim their horses to the opposite bank. \" What,\" cried Twenge, \" vo lunteer to drown myself, when I can cut my way through the midst of them, back to the bridge ? Never let such foul slander fall on us, my dear friends !\" So saying he put spurs to his horse, and driving him into the midst of the enemy, hewed a passage for himself through the thickest of the Scottish columns, and rejoined his friends, with his nephew and his ar mour-bearer, in perfect safety. Meanwhile the Scots committed a dreadful slaugh ter of those who remained. It is the remark of the historian Hemingford, who writes from the informa tion of eye-witnesses, that in all Scotland there could not be found a place better fitted for the defeat of a"], [158, "1297- 142 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. powerful army by a handful of men, than the ground which Wallace had chosen.1 Thousands perished in the river ; and as the confusion and slaughter increa sed, and the entire defeat of the English became ine vitable, the Earl of Lennox and the Steward of Scot land, who, although allies of the King of England, were secretly in treaty with Wallace, threw off the mask, and led a body of their followers to destroy and plunder the flying English. Surry, on being joined by Sir Marmaduke Twenge, remained no longer on the field, but having hastily ordered him to occupy the castle of Stirling, which he promised to relieve in ten days, he rode, without drawing bridle, to Ber wick ; a clear proof of the total defeat of the powerful army which he had led into Scotland. From Ber wick he proceeded to join the Prince of Wales in the South, and left the country which had been intrusted to him, exposed to ravage and desolation. Although the English historians restrict the loss of soldiers in this fatal and important battle to five thousand foot, and a hundred heavy-armed horse,2 it is quite evi dent that nearly the whole English army was cut to pieces. Cressingham the Treasurer was amongst the 1 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 128. 2 So say Hemingford and Knighton.

Now the English army consisted of fifty thousand foot and one thousand horse. Hemingford, p. 127. See Notes and Illus trations, letter H."], [159, "1297. PERIOD OF WALLACE. 143 first who fell, and the Earl of Surry fled alone, and at full speed, from the field. Hemingford allows, that the plunder which fell into the hands of the Scots was very great, and that waggons were filled with the spoils. Smarting under the cruel inso lence and rapacity with which they had been treated by the English, the Scots were not slow now to take their revenge, nor was Wallace of a temper to restrain his soldiers. Few prisoners seem to have fallen into their hands, and the slaughter was proba bly general and indiscriminate. So deep was the de testation in which the Scots held the character of Cressingham the Treasurer, that his dead body was mangled, the skin torn from the limbs, and in savage triumph cut into pieces.1 The decisive nature of the defeat is, perhaps, most apparent, from the important consequences which attended it. To use the words of Knighton, \" this awful beginning of hostilities roused the spirit of Scotland, and sunk the hearts of the English.\" 2 Dundee immediately surrendered to Wallace, and rewarded his army by a rich booty of arms and money.

A dreadful dearth and famine, no unfrequent ac companiment of the ravages of war, now fell severely upon the country, and Wallace, profiting by the panic inspired by his victory at Stirling, resolved upon an immediate expedition into England. To enable his own people to lay in, against the time of scarcity, the provisions which would otherwise be consumed by his numerous army, and to support his soldiers during the winter months in an enemy's country, were wise objects. Previous, however, to his marching into England, he commanded, that from every county, barony, town, and village, a certain proportion of the fighting men, between sixteen and sixty, should be levied. These levies, however, even after so glorious a victory as that of Stirling, were tardily made. The vassals of Scotland, tied up by the rigid fetters of the feudal law, could not join Wallace without the au thority of their overlords ; and as most of the Scot tish nobility had left hostages for their fidelity in the 1 Leland Collect, vol. i. p. 541, from the Scal\u00e6 Chronicon. 16"], [161, "1297. PERIOD OF WALLACE. 145 hands of Edward, and many of them possessed great estates in England, which, upon joining Wallace, would have immediately been forfeited, they did not yet dare to take the field against the English. A jealousy too, of the high military renown and great popularity of Wallace, prevented all cordial co-opera tion. And the contempt with which this deliverer of his country must have regarded the nobility, who yet sheltered themselves under the wing of Edward, was not calculated to allay this feeling. The battle of Stirling was fought on the 11th of September, and on the twenty-fifth of that month the English go vernment, in great alarm for the success of Wallace, sent letters to the principal Scottish nobility, praising them for their fidelity to the king, informing them that they were aware the Earl of Surry was on his way to England, (a delicate way of noticing the flight of Warrene from Stirling,) and directing them to joiu Brian Fitz-Alan, the governor of Scotland, with all their horse and foot, in order to put down the trea sonable rebellion of the Scots. The only nobles with whom the English government did not communicate, were the Earls of Caithness, Ross, Mar, Athole, Fife, and Carrick. Fife, however, was a minor ; the others, we may presume, had by this time joined the party of Wallace.1 The great majority of the nobles being still against 1 John Comyn, of Badenoch ; Patrick, Earl of Dunbar ; Umfra ville, Earl of Angus ; Alexander, Earl of Menteith ; Malise, Earl of Strathern ; James, the Steward of Scotland ; John Comyn, Earl VOL.

Gibbets were erected in each barony and country town ; and some burgesses of Aberdeen, who had disobeyed the summons, were hanged.1 After this example, he soon found himself at the head of a numerous army ; and having taken with him, as his partner in command, Sir Andrew Moray of Bothwell, a gallant youth, and afterwards regent of the kingdom, he marched towards the north of England and threatened Northumberland.2 Such was the terror inspired by the approach of the Scots, that the whole population of this county, with their wives and little ones, their cattle and household goods, deserted their dwellings, and took refuge in Newcastle. The Scots, to whom plunder was a prin cipal object, delayed their advance ; and the North umbrians, imagining the danger to be over, returned home ; but Wallace, informed of this by his scouts, made a rapid march across the border, and dreadfully wasted the two counties of Cumberland and Northum berland with fire and sword, carrying off an immense booty, and having the head-quarters of his army in the forest of Rothebury. \" At this time,\" says Hem ingford, \" the praise of God was unheard in any of Buchan ; Malcolm, Earl of Lennox ; and William, Earl of Su therland; Nicholas de la Haye, Ingelram de Umfraville, Richard, Fraser, and Alexander de Lindesaye, were the nobles written to by the English government.

But these were slight suc cesses, and the Scots roved over the country from the Feast of St Luke to St Martin's day, inflicting upon it all the miseries of unrestrained rapine and blood shed.\"1 After this, Wallace assembled his whole army, and proceeded in his destructive march to Carlisle. He did not deem it prudent, however, to attack this city, which was strongly garrisoned, and contented himself with laying waste Cumberland and Annandale, from Inglewood Forest to Derwentwater and Cocker mouth.2 It was next determined to invade the county of Durham, which would have been easily accomplish ed, as three thousand foot and a hundred armed horse were all that could be mustered for its defence. But the winter now set in with great severity. The frost was so intense, and the scarcity of provisions so grie vous, that multitudes of the Scots perished by cold or famine, and Wallace commanded a retreat. On re turning to Hexham, where there was a rich monas tery which had already been plundered and deserted 1 Hemingford, p. 132, vol. i. From 18th Oct. to 11th Nov, 2 Fordun a Hearne, p. 980,"], [164, "1297. 148 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. on the advance, a striking scene occurred. Three monks were seen in the solitary chapel. Thinking that the tide of war had passed over, they had crept back to repair the ravages it had left, when suddenly they saw the army returning, and fled in terror into a little oratory. In a moment the Scottish soldiers with their long lances were upon them, and brandish ing them over their heads, called out to them, on peril of their lives, to show them the treasures of their mo nastery. \" Alas,\" said one of the monks, \" it is but a short time since you yourselves have seized our whole property, and you know best where it now is.\" At this moment Wallace himself came into the ora tory, and commanding his soldiers to be silent, re quested one of the canons to celebrate mass. The monk obeyed, and Wallace, all armed as he was, aud surrounded by his soldiers, reverently attended ; when it came to the elevation of the host, he stept out of the oratory to cast off his helmet aud lay aside his arms, but in this short absence the fury and avarice of his soldiers broke out. They pressed on the priest, snatched the cup from the high altar, tore away its ornaments and the sacred vestments, and even stole the book in which the ceremony had been begun. When Wallace returned to the chapel, he found the priest in horror and dismay, and gave orders that the sacrilegious wretches who. had com mitted the outrage, should be sought for and put to death. Meanwhile he took the canons under his spe cial protection. \" Remain with me,\" said he, \" it is that alone which can secure you. My soldiers are"], [165, "1297.

I cannot justify, and I dare not pu- nish them.\" l The monastery of Hexham was dedi- cated to the Patron Saint of Scotland, and enjoyed a perpetual protection from King David. Wallace, to atone for the outrage, granted a charter of protec- tion to the priory and convent, by which its lauds, men, and movables, were admitted under the peace of the king, and all persons interdicted on pain of the loss of life and members, from doing them injury.

The Scots now advanced to Newcastle, but finding the garrison prepared to stand a siege, they contented themselves with ravaging the adjacent country, and having collected a great booty, they allotted their part to the Galwegians who were with the army, and march ed homewards.2 In revenge for this terrible visitation from Wal lace, Lord Robert Clifford collected the strength of Carlisle and Cumberland, and twice invaded Annan dale with an army of twenty thousand foot and a hun dred horse. On passing the Solway, it was proclaim ed by sound of trumpet, that every soldier should plunder for himself, and keep his own booty ; on hear ing which, the infantry with undisciplined rapacity 1 Hemingford, vol. i. pp. 133, 134.

Three hundred and eight Scots were slain, ten villages or hamlets burnt, and a few prisoners taken. This happened at Christmas. In his second inroad, the town of Annan, and the church of Gysborne, were burnt and plundered.1 An nandale belonged to Robert Bruce, and the destruc tion of his lands and villages determined him once more to desert the English, and join the party of Wallace. Soon after his return from his expedition into Eng land, Wallace, in an assembly held at the Forest Kirk in Selkirkshire, which was attended by the Earl of Lennox, William Douglas, and others of the principal nobility, was elected Governor of Scotland, iu name of King John, and with consent of the com munity of Scotland.2 Strengthened by this high title, which he had so well deserved, he proceeded to re ward his friends and fellow-soldiers, to threaten and punish his enemies, and, despising the jealousy and the desertion of a great majority of the nobility, to adopt and enforce those public measures which he considered necessary for securing the liberty of the country. He conferred the office of Constabulary of Dundee upon Alexander Skirmishur, or Scrimgeour, and his heirs, for his faithful aid in bearing the royal banner of Scotland.3 By a strict severity, he restrain- ''Knighton, p. 2522. 2 Crawford, Hist, of House of Douglas, p. 22.

In each shire, barony, lordship, town, and burgh, he appointed a muster-book to be made, of the number of fighting men which they contained, between the age of sixteen and sixty,2 and from these he drew at pleasure, and in case of refusal, under pain of life and limb, as many recruits as he thought requisite. In a short time, such were the effects of his firm and cou rageous dealing in the government, that the most powerful of the nobility were compelled, by the fears of imprisonment, to submit to his authority, although in their hearts they envied him his high elevation, and whenever an opportunity presented itself, took part with the King of England.3 But although few of the earls had joined him, the lesser barons and gentry repaired in great numbers to the banner of the Governor, and willingly supported him with all their retainers.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. pled and rapid success with which it was attended, determined the English Regency to summon a par liament at London, on the 10th of October.1 To this assembly came the Earl of Norfolk and the Earl of Hereford, the one Marshal and the other Constable of England, with so powerful a body of their retain ers, that they overawed its proceedings ; and aware of the trying emergency in which the rebellion of the Scots had placed the king, they resolutely declared, that no aids or levies should be granted against the Scots, unless the Great Charter, and the Charter of the Forests, were solemnly ratified, along with an addi tional clause, which prohibited any aid or tallage from being exacted, without the consent of the pre lates, nobles, knights, and other freemen. Edward was startled when informed of these demands. His affairs still detained him in Flanders, where accounts had reached him of the whole of Scotland having been wrested from his hand by Wallace ; he was still en gaged in a war with France, and thus surrounded by difficulties, it was absolutely necessary for him to make every sacrifice to remain on good terms with his barons.2 He accordingly, after three days' deli beration, consented to confirm all the charters which had been sent over to him ; and having wisely secu red the affections of his nobility, he directed letters to the earls and barons of England, commanding 1 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 138. 1 Tyrrel, Hist.

These seasonable favours granted to the nobility, and the good grace with which Edward bestowed them, although, in truth, they were extorted from him much against his inclination, rendered the king highly popular ; so that at York, on the day appoint ed, there was a great and splendid muster of the mili tary force of the kingdom. There came there the Earl Marshal and the Great Constable of England, the Earl of Surry, the King's Lieutenant against the Scots, the Earls of Gloucester and Arundel, Lord Henry Percy, John de Wake, John de Segrave, Guido, son of the Earl of Warwick, and many other powerful earls and barons.2 Having waited in vain for the Scottish nobles whom Edward had summoned to attend, an order which it is probable the dread of Wallace rather than the love of their country com pelled them to disobey, the English nobles appointed a general muster of the whole army to be held eight days after, at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, purposing from 1 The Confirmation of Magna Charta and the Charta de Foresta, is dated at Ghent, Nov. 5, 1297.

Here they accordingly met, and the army, both in numbers and equipment, was truly formidable. There were two thousand choice cavalry, armed both horse and man at all points, along with two thousand light horse, and a hundred thousand foot, including the men of Wales. With this force they marched across the border, and advanced to Roxburgh. This important fortress was then besieged by Wallace ; and the gar rison, worn out by a long leaguer, were in a state of great distress, when the army of Surry made its ap pearance, and the Scots thought it prudent to retire. After relieving \" their wounded countrymen,\" the English skirmished as far as Kelso, and returned to occupy Berwick, which had been in the hands of the Scots since the battle of Stirling. They found it de serted, and brought a joyful and seasonable relief to the castle, the garrison of which had stoutly held out, although the rest of the town was in possession of the enemy.1 Edward, in the meantime, having learnt in Flan ders what a noble army awaited his orders, was rest less and impatient till he had joined them in person. His anger against the Scots, and his determination to inflict a signal vengeance upon their perfidy on again daring to defend their liberties, had induced him to make every sacrifice, that he might proceed with an overwhelming force against this country. For this pur pose, he hastened to conclude a truce with the King of 1 Knighton, 2525. Triveti Annales, p. 311."], [171, "1298. 155 PERIOD OF WALLACE. France, and to refer their dispute to the judgment of Boniface thc Pope.1 He wrote to the Earl of Surry not to march into Scotland till he had joined the army in person ; and having rapidly concluded his affairs in Flanders, he took shipping, and landed at Sand wich, where he was received with great rejoicing and acclamation.2 Surry, on receiving letters from the king to delay his expedition, had only retained with him fifteen hundred horse, and twenty thousand foot, having dismissed the rest of his immense army. The moment Edward set his foot in England, he directed his writs, by which he summoned the whole military power of England to meet him at York, on the Feast of Pentecost, with horse and arms, to proceed against the Scots.3 He also commanded all the earls and barons, with two knights of every shire, and the representa tives from the towns and burghs, to attend his par liament to be held in that city, and summoned the nobility of Scotland, unless they chose to be treated as vassals who had renounced their allegiance, to be there also on the day appointed.4 To this summons the barons of Scotland paid no regard.

Meanwhile Edward, in whose mind superstition was a strong fea ture, having commanded his army to rendezvous at Roxburgh on the 24th of June, made a pilgrimage to the shrine of St John of Beverley. The sacred standard of this saint, held in deep reverence by the king and the army, had been carried with the host in the former war, and it is probable Edward would not lose the opportunity of taking it along with him in this expedition. On coming to Roxburgh, he found himself at the head of an army more formidable in their number, and more splendid in their equipment, than even that which had been collected by the Earl of Surry six months before. He had seven thousand horse, three thousand heavy-armed, both men and horse, and four thousand light cavalry. His infantry consisted at first of eighty thousand men, mostly Welsh and Irish ; but these were soon strengthened by the arrival of a power ful reinforcement from Gascony, amongst whom were five hundred horse, splendidly armed, and admirably mounted. On reviewing his troops, Edward found, that the Constable and Marshal, with the barons of their party, refused to advance a step, until the con firmation of the Great Charter, and the Charter of the Forests, had been ratified by the king in person ; so jealous were they of their new rights, and so sus picious lest he should plead, that his former consent,"], [173, "1298. PERIOD OF WALLACE. 157 given when in foreign parts, did not bind him within his own dominions.'- Edward dissembled his resent ment, and evaded their demand, by bringing forward the Bishop of Durham, and the Earls of Surry, Nor folk and Lincoln, who solemnly swore, on the soul of their lord the king, that on his return, if he obtained the victory, he would accede to their request.2 Com pelled to rest satisfied with this wary promise, which he afterwards tried in every way to elude, the refrac tory barons consented to advance into Scotland. Meanwhile that country, notwithstanding the late expulsion of its enemies, was little able to contend with the superior numbers and admirable equipment of the army now led against it. It was cruelly weak ened by the continued dissensions and jealousy of its nobility. Ever since the elevation of Wallace to the rank of Governor of Scotland, the greater barons had envied his assumption of power, and looking upon him as a person of ignoble birth, had seized all op portunities to resist and despise his authority.3 These mean and selfish jealousies were increased by the ter ror of Edward's military renown, and in many by the fear of losing their English estates; so that at the very 1 Hemingford, p. 159. vol. i. 2 \" Quod in reditu\" suo, obtenta victoria, \" omnia perimpleret ad votum.\" Hemingford, p. 159.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. time when an honest love of liberty, and a simulta neous spirit of resistance, could alone have saved Scot land, its nobility deserted it at its utmost need, and refused to act with the only man whose military ta lents and prosperity were equal to the emergency. The Governor, however, still endeavoured to collect the strength of the country. John Comyn of Bade noch, the younger, Sir John Stewart of Bonkyll, bro ther to the Stewart, Sir John Graham of Abercorn, and Macduff, the granduncle of the Earl of Fife, con sented to act along with him, whilst Robert Bruce, maintaining a suspicious neutrality, remained with a strong body of his vassals in the castle of Ayr. The plan adopted by Wallace for the defence of Scot land, was the same as that which was afterwards so successfully executed by Bruce. It was to avoid a general battle, which, with an army far inferior to the English, must have been fought at a disadvan tage ; to fall back slowly before the enemy, leaving Some garrisons in the most important castles, driving off all supplies, wasting the country through which the English were to march, and waiting till the scarcity of provisions compelled them to retreat, and gave him a favourable opportunity of breaking down upon them with full effect. Edward had determined to penetrate into the west of Scotland, and there he purposed to conclude the war. He directed a fleet with supplies for his army, to sail round from Berwick to the Firth of Forth ; and having left Roxburgh, he proceeded by moderate marches into Scotland, laying waste the country, and anxious for a sight of his enemies. No"], [175, "1298. PERIOD OF WALLACE. 159 one, however, was to be found, who could give him any information regarding the Scottish army, and he proceeded through Berwickshire to Lauder,1 and without a check to Templeliston, now Kirkliston, a small town between Edinburgh and Linlithgow. Here, as provisions began already to be scarce, he de termined to remain, in order to receive the earliest intelligence of his fleet, and, in case of accidents, to secure his retreat. At this time he learnt that fre quent sorties were made against the foraging parties of his rear division, by the Scottish garrison in the strong castle of Dirleton, and that two other fortali ces, which he had passed on his march, were likely to give him annoyance.8 Upon this he dispatched his favourite martial bishop, Anthony Beck, who sat down before the castle ; but on account of the want of pro per battering machines, found it too strong for him. He then attempted to carry it by assault, but was driven back with loss ; and as his division began to be in extreme want, the bishop sent Sir John Mar- maduke to require the king's pleasure. \" Go back,\" said Edward, \" and tell Anthony that he is right to be pacific, when he is acting the bishop, but that in his present business he must forget his calling. As for you,\" continued the king, addressing Marmaduke, \" you are a relentless soldier, and I have often had to reprove you for too cruel an exultation over the death of your enemies ; but return now whence you came, and be as relentless as you choose. You will have 1 Prynne, Edward I., p. 788. - Hemingford, vol. i. p. 160."], [176, "160 1298. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. my thanks, not my censure ; and look you do not see my face again, till these three castles are razed to the ground.\"1 In the meantime, the besiegers were providentially relieved from the extremities of want, by the arrival of three ships with provisions ; and the bishop, on re ceiving the king's message, took advantage of the re newed strength and spirits of his soldiers, to order an assault, which was successful, the garrison having sti pulated, before surrender, that their lives should be spared.2 Edward, when at Kirkliston, had raised some of the young squires in his army to the rank of knight hood ; and these new knights were sent to gain their spurs, by taking the other two fortalices. On coming before them, however, they found that the Scots had abandoned them to the enemy, and having destroyed them, they rejoined the main army.3 These transactions occupied a month, and the army began again to suffer severely from the scarcity of pro visions. The fleet from Berwick was anxiously looked for, and Edward foresaw, that in the event of its ar rival being protracted a few days longer, he should be compelled to retreat. At last a few ships were seen off the coast, which brought a small but welcome sup ply ; but the great body of the fleet was still detained by contrary winds, and a dangerous mutiny broke out in the camp. The Welsh troops had suffered much 1 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 160. 8 Ibid. p. 161. Walsingham, p. 75. 3 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 161,"], [177, "1298. PERIOD OF WALLACE. 161 from famine, and a present of wine having been sent to them by the king, their soldiers, in a paroxysm of intoxication and national antipathy, attacked the Eng lish quarters in the night, and sacrilegiously murder ed eighteen priests. Upon this the English cavalry hastily ran to their weapons, and breaking in upon the Welsh, slew eighty men. In the morning the Welsh, of whom there were forty thousand in the army, exasperated at the death of their companions, threatened to join the Scots. \" Let them do so,\" said Edward, with his usual cool courage ; \" Let them go over to my enemies ; I hope to see the day when I shall chastise them both.\" This day, however, was, to all appearance, distant. The distress for provisions now amounted to an absolute famine. No intelligence had been received of the Scottish army. As the Eng lish advanced, the country had been wasted by an in visible enemy; and Edward, wearied out, was at length compelled to issue orders for a retreat to Edin burgh, hoping to meet with his fleet at Leith, and thereafter to recommence operations against the ene my. At this critical juncture, when the military skill and wisdom of the dispositions made by Wallace be came apparent, and when the moment to harass and destroy the invading army in its retreat had arrived, the treachery of its nobles again betrayed Scotland to her enemy. Two Scottish lords, Patrick, Earl of Dun bar, aud the Earl of Angus, privately, at day-break, sought the quarters of the Bishop of Durham, and informed him that the Scots were encamped not far off, in the forest of Falkirk. The Scottish earls, who VOL. i. i"], [178, "162 1298. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. dreaded the resentment of Edward, on account of their late renunciation of allegiance,1 did not venture to seek the king in persen. They sent their intelli- gence by a page, and added, that having heard of his projected retreat, it was the intention of Wallace to surprise him by a night attack, and to hang upon and harass his rear. Edward, on hearing this welcome news, could not conceal his joy. \" Thanks be to God,\" he exclaimed, \" who hitherto hath extricated me from every danger. They shall not need to fol- low me, since I shall forthwith go and meet them.\" Without a moment's delay, orders were issued for the soldiers to arm, and hold themselves ready to march. The king was the first to put on his armour, and mounting his horse, rode through the camp, hasten- ing the preparations, and giving orders, in person, to the merchants and sutlers who attended the army to pack up their wares, and be ready to follow him. At length all was prepared, and at three o'clock the whole army was on its advance from Kirkliston to Falkirk, astonished at the sudden change in the plan of operations, and at the slow and deliberate pace with which they were led on. It was late before they 1 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 165. Hailes, for what reason it is not easy to determine, has omitted the important fact, that the intelligence regarding the position of the army was brought by two Scottish earls. He could not have overlooked it, as he quotes the very page of Hemingford, where it is noticed ; but it is singular that his lordship has attempted to disprove the undoubted fact, \" that thc defeat at Falkirk was brought about by the dissensions amongst the Scottish leaders,\" and that a principal proof of these dissensions is to be found in thc passage which he has omitted."], [179, "1298. PERIOD OF WALLACE. 163 reached a heath near Linlithgow, on which they en camped for the night. They were not allowed the refreshment of disarming themselves ; but to use the striking words of Hemingford, \" each soldier slept on the ground, using his shield for his pillow ; each horseman had his horse beside him, and the horses themselves tasted nothing but cold iron, champing their bridles.\" In the middle of the night, a cry was heard. King Edward, who slept on the heath whilst a page held his horse, was awakened by a sudden stroke on his side. The boy had been careless, and the horse, in changing his position, had put his foot on the king as he slept. Those around him cried out that their prince was wounded ; and this, in the confusion of the night, was soon raised into a shout, that the enemy were upon them, so that they hastily armed themselves, and prepared for their defence. But the mistake was soon explained. Edward had been only slightly hurt ; and as the morning was near, he mounted his horse and gave orders to march. They passed through Linlithgow a little before sun rise, and on looking up to a rising ground, at some distance in their front, observed the ridge of the hill lined with lances. Not a moment was lost. Their columns marched up the hill, but on reaching it the enemy had disappeared ; and as it was the feast of St Mary Magdalen, the king ordered a tent to be raised, where he and the Bishop of Durham heard mass. These lances had been the advanced guard of the enemy ; for while mass was saying, and the day became brighter, the English soldiers could"], [180, "164 1298. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. distinctly see the Scots in the distance arranging their lines, and preparing for battle. The Scottish army did not amount to the third part of the force of the English, and Wallace, who dreaded this great disparity, and knew how much Ed ward was likely to suffer by the protraction of the war and the want of provisions, at first thought of a retreat, and hastened to lead off his soldiers ; but he soon found that the English were too near to admit of this being accomplished without certain destruc tion, and he therefore proceeded to draw up his army, so as best to avail himself of the nature of the ground, and to sustain the attack of the English. He divi ded his infantry into four compact divisions, called Schiltrons,1 composed of his lancers. In the first line the men knelt, with their lances turned obliquely out wards, so as to present a serried front to the enemy on every side. In this infantry consisted the chief strength of the Scottish army, for the lancers stood so close, aud were so linked or chained together, that to break the line was extremely difficult.2 In the spaces between these divisions were placed the archers, and in the rear was drawn up the Scottish cavalry, con sisting of about a thousand heavy-armed horse.3 1 See Notes and Illustrations, letter I. 2 \" Ther formost courey ther bakkis togidere sette, There speres poynt over poynt, so sare, and so thikke And fast togidere joynt, to se it was ferlike, Als a castelle thei stode, that were walled with stone, Thei wende no man of blode thorgh tham suld has gone.\" Langtoft's Chronicle, book ii. 1. 305.

After hearing mass, the King of England, being in- formed of the Scottish disposition of battle, hesitated to lead his army forward to the attack, and proposed that they should pitch their tents, and allow the sol- diers and the horses time for rest and refreshment. This was opposed by his officers as unsafe, on account of there being nothing but a small rivulet between the two armies. \" What then would you advise ?\" asked Edward. \" An immediate advance,\" said they ; \" the field and the victory will be ours.\" \u2014 \" In God's name, then, let it be so,\" replied the king ; and without de- lay, the barons who commanded the first division, the Marshal of England, and the Earls of Hereford and Lincoln, led their soldiers in a direct line against the enemy.1 They were not aware, however, of an exten- sive moss which stretched along the front of the Scot- tish position, and, on reaching it, they were obliged to make a circuit to the west to get rid of the obstacle. This retarded their advance ; meanwhile the second line, under the command of the Bishop of Durham, being better informed of the nature of the ground, in advancing inclined to the east with the same object. The bishop's cavalry were fiery and impetuous. Thir- ty-six banners floated above the wood of spears, and showed how many leaders of distinction were in the field ; but Anthony Beck, who had seen enough of war to know the danger of too precipitate an attack, 1 Lord Hailes, p. 260, says \u2014 \" Bigod, at the head of the first line, rushed on to the charge.\" This is written for effect.

We are all soldiers to-day, and bound to do our duty.\" So saying, they hastened for ward, and in a few minutes engaged with the first co lumn of the Scots ; whilst the first line, which had extricated itself from the morass, commenced its attack upon the other flank. Wallace's anxiety to avoid a battle, had, in all probability, arisen from his having little dependence on the fidelity of the heavy-armed cavalry, commanded by those nobles who hated and feared him ; and the event showed how just were his suspicions, for the moment the lines met, the whole body of the Scottish horse retired without striking a blow.1 The columns of infantry, however, with the in termediate companies of archers, kept their ground, and a few of the armed knights remained beside them. Amongst these, Sir John Stewart, brother of the High Steward, in marshalling the ranks of the arch ers from the forest of Selkirk, was thrown from his horse. The faithful bowmen tried to rescue him, but 1 Fordun a Hearne, p. 981. \" Nam propter conceptam maliciam, ex fonte invidi\u00e6 generatam, quam erga dictum Willelmum Cumi nenses habebant, cum suis complicibus campum deserentes, ill\u00e6si evaserunt.\" See also Hemingford, p. 164 \u2014 \" Fugerunt Scottorum equestres absque ullo gladii ictu.\"\u2014 And Wynton, book viii. cap. 15, 1.47."], [183, "1298. 167 PERIOD OF WALLACE. in vain. He was slain, and the tall and athletic figures of those who fell round him drew forth the praise of the enemy.1 On the death of this leader the archers gave way, but the columns of the Scottish infantry stood firm, and their oblique lances pointing every way, presented a thick wood, through which no attacks of the cavalry could penetrate. Edward now brought up his reserve of archers, who showered their arrows upon them, and volleys of large round stones, which covered the ground where they stood. This continued and galling attack, along with the reiterated charges of the cavalry, at last broke the first line, and the heavy-armed horse, pouring in at the gap which was thus made, threw all into confu- sion, and carried indiscriminate slaughter through their ranks. Macduff, along with his vassals from Fife, was slain;2 and Wallace, with the remains of his army, having gained the neighbouring wood, made good his retreat, leaving nearly fifteen thousand men dead upon the field.3 On the English side, only two men of note fell ; one of them was Sir Bryan de Jaye, Master of the Scottish Templars, who, when pressing before his men in the ardour of the pursuit, was en tangled in a moss in Calendar wood, and slain by some 1 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 165. 2 Wynton, book viii. cap. 15, 1. 45. 3 Tyrrel, vol. iii. p. 130, who quotes as his authority the Nor wich Chronicle and the Chronicle of John Eversden \u2014 both Eng lish authorities.

The other was a companion of the same order, and of high rank.1 The remains of the Scottish army retreated from Falkirk to Stirling. Unable to maintain the town against the English army, they set it on fire, and Edward, on entering it on the fourth day after the battle, found it reduced to ashes.2 The convent of the Dominicans, however, escaped the flames, and here the king, who still suffered from the wound given him by his horse, remained for fifteen days, to recover his health. Meantime he sent a division of his army across the Forth into Clackmannanshire and Menteith, which, after ravaging the country, and plundering the villages, advanced in its destruc tive march through Fifeshire. The whole of this rich and populous district was now especially ob noxious, on account of the resistance made by Mac duff and the men of Fife at Falkirk. It was accord ingly delivered up to complete military execution, and, to use the words of an ancient chronicle, \" clene brent.\"3 The city of St Andrews was found deserted by its inhabitants, and delivered to the flames.

Having left a garrison there, he proceeded to Abercorn,1 near Queensferry, where he had hoped to find his long-expected fleet, with supplies from Berwick ; but his ships were still detained. He then marched to Glasgow, and through the district of Clydesdale, by Bothwell, to Lanark, from which he proceeded towards the strong castle of Ayr, then in the hands of the younger Bruce, Earl of Carrie. Bruce fled at the approach of the king, after having set fire to the castle, and Edward marched into Galloway with the intention of punishing this refrac tory baron, by laying waste his country.2 The army, however, began again to be grievously in want of provisions, and the king, after having for fifteen days struggled against famine, was constrained to return through the middle of Annandale, and to be content ed with the capture of Bruce's Castle of Lochmaben,3 from which he proceeded to Carlisle. Thus were the fruits of the bloody and decisive battle of Fal kirk plucked from the hands of Edward by famine and distress, at the moment he expected to secure them ; and after leading against Scotland the most numerous and best appointed army which had per haps ever invaded it, and defeating his enemies with great slaughter, he was compelled to retreat while still 1 Trivet, p. 313, calls this place \" Abourtoun juxta Queenes ferrie;\" and Hearne, the editor, in a note, observes it may mean Aberdour.

Edward, when at Lochmaben, had, without consulting them or their brother nobles, dis- posed of the Island of Arran to Thomas Bisset, a Scottish adventurer, who, having invaded and seized the island, about the time of the battle of Falkirk, pretended that he had made a conquest of it for the King of England. This was done in violation of a solemn promise, that without advice of his council, he would adopt no new measures ; and to atone for so ir regular a proceeding, a parliament was held at Car lisle, in which the king, who as yet was master of but a very small part of Scotland, assigned to his earls and barons the estates of the Scottish nobles. These, 1 Lord Hailes, 4to edit. vol. i. p. 263, erroneously ascribes the successes of Edward in this campaign, to the precipitancy of the Scots. The Scots were anything but precipitate. They wasted the country, and purposely retired from Edward ; nor did they fight, till the Earl of Dunbar and the Earl of Angus treacherously brought information where the Scottish army lay, and enabled Ed ward, by a rapid night-march, to surprise them. Edward owed his success to the fatal dissensions amongst the Scots, and to the su perior numbers and equipment of his army. Fordun a Hearne, p. 985, observes, after stating that Edward was obliged to retreat, \" Quod Deo procurante factum esse non ambigitur.

His army was now greatly reduced by the desertion of Norfolk and Hereford, and the soldiers who remained were weakened with famine and the fatigues of war. To commence another campaign at this late season was impossible, but he instantly issued his writs for the assembling of a new army, to chastise the obsti nate and reiterated rebellions of the Scots, and he ap pointed his barons to meet him at Carlisle, on the eve of the day of Pentecost.2 He also commanded the speedy collection of the money granted by the clergy of the province of York, to assist him in his war with Scotland, and dispatched letters to the no bles of England, ordering their attendance in the army destined against Scotland.

The Comyns had threatened to impeach him of treason for his conduct during the war ; and the Bruces, next in power to the Comyns, appear to have forgot their per sonal animosity, and united with their rivals to put him down. To these accusations the disaster at Fal kirk gave some colour, and he chose rather to return to the station of a private knight, than to retain an ele vation, wlfich, owing to the jealousy of the nobility, brought ruin and distress upon the people.2 His great name does not again recur in any authentic record, as bearing even a secondary command in the wars against Edward, nor indeed do we again meet with him in any public transaction, until eight years after this, when he fell avictim to the unrelenting vengeanceof that prince.

John Baliol, whom the Scots still acknowledged as their rightful monarch, had remained a prisoner in England, since 1296. On the conclusion of a truce between the Kings of France and England in 1297,2 the articles of which afterwards formed the basis of the negotiations at Montreuil/ and of the important peace of Paris,4 Philip demanded the liberation of Baliol, as his ally, from the Tower. He required, also, that the prelates, barons, knights, and other nobles, along with the towns and communities, and all the inhabitants of Scotland, of what rank and condition soever, should be included iu the truce, and that not only Baliol, but all the other Scot tish prisoners, should be liberated, on the delivery of hostages. These demands were made by special messengers, sent for this purpose by Philip to the King of England;6 and it is probable that John 1 Rymer, Feeder, p. 915. new edit, part ii.

Comyn the younger, the Earl of Athole, and other Scottish barons, who had left Edward on his embark ation at Hardenburgh in Flanders,1 and repaired to the Court of France, prevailed upon Philip to be thus urgent in his endeavours to include them and their country in the articles of truce and pacification. Ed ward, however, had not the slightest intention of al lowing the truce to be extended to the Scots. He was highly exasperated against them, and was then busy in collecting and organizing an army for the pur pose of entirely reducing their country. He did not, at first, however, give a direct refusal, but observed, that the request touching the king, and the realm, and nobles of Scotland, was so new and foreign to the other articles of truce, that it would require his most solemn deliberation before he could reply.2 Imme diately after this, he marched, as we have seen, at the head of an overwhelming army into Scotland, and, after the battle of Falkirk, found leisure to send his answer to Philip, refusing peremptorily to deliver up Baliol, or to include the Scottish nobles in the truce, on the ground, that at the time when the articles of truce were drawn up, Philip did not consider the Scots as his allies, nor was there any mention of Ba liol or his subjects at that time.3 \" If,\" said Ed ward, \" any alliance ever existed between Baliol and Philip, it had been deliberately and freely renoun- 1 Walsingham, p. 75.

Edward, however, who, at the time he made this reply, had defeated Wallace at Falkirk, and disper sed thc only army which stood between him and his ambition, continued firm, notwithstanding the earnest remonstrances of Philip. The mediation of the Pope was next employed ; and at the earnest request of Boniface, the king consented to deliver Baliol from his imprisonment, and to place him in the hands of the Pope's Legate, the Bishop of Vicenza. \" I will send him to the Pope,\" said Edward, \" as a false se ducer of the people, and a perjured man.\" 2 Accord ino-ly, Sir Robert Burghersh, the Constable of Dover, conveyed the dethroned king, with his goods and 1 The important public instrument from which these facts re garding the negotiations between Edward and Philip are taken, bas been printed for the first time in the new edition of Rymer's F\u0153 dera, vol. i. part ii. p. 898.

The crown was seized by Edward, and hung up in the shrine of St Thomas the Martyr ; the Great Seal was also retained, but the money was permitted to remain in his coffers. On meeting the Papal Legate at Whitsand, Burghersh formally de livered to this prelate the person of the ex-king, to be at the sole disposal of the Pope ; but a material condition was added, in the proviso \" that the Pope should not ordain or direct anything in the kingdom of Scotland concerning the people or inhabitants, or anything appertaining to the same kingdom, in be half of John Baliol or his heirs.\" Edward's obsequi ousness to the Holy See even went farther, for he conferred on the Pope the power of disposing of Ba liol's English estates. These estates were many and extensive. They were situated in nine different counties, and gave a commanding feudal influence to their possessor. But the king had not the slightest intention of paying anything more than an empty compliment to Boniface, for he retained the whole of Baliol's lands aud manors in his own hand, and some years afterwards, bestowed them upon his nephew, John of Bretagne.1 The late King of Scotland was conveyed by the messengers of the Pope to his lands and castle of 1 Rymerj F\u0153der. new edit. vol. i. part ii. p. 1002.

He was embroiled in serious disputes with his barons ; some of the most valuable prerogatives of his crown were being wrested from his hands ; he was deeply engaged with his negotiations with France ; he was on the eve of his marriage ; but nothing could divert him from the meditated war. He held a great council of his nobility at Westmin ster, concerning the Scottish expedition. At Mid summer he took a journey to St Albans, for the pur pose of imploring the assistance of that saint.2 In September he was married at Canterbury, to the sister of the King of France ; and on the seventh day after his marriage, he directed his letters to Edmund Earl of Cornwall, to meet him with horse and arms at York, on the 10th of November.3 He commanded public prayers to be made for the success of his arms in all the churches of the kingdom, and enjoined the friars predicants to employ themselves in the same pious office.

They al leged that the early severity of the winter, the impas sable and marshy ground through which they would be compelled to march, with the scarcity of forage and provisions, rendered any military expedition against Scotland impracticable and desperate.1 The barons, besides this, had other and deeper causes of discontent. The great charter, and the perambulation of the forests, had not been duly observed, according to promise ; and without waiting remonstrance, they withdrew to their estates. Edward, in extreme anger, marched forward, with a very small force, and seemed determined to risk a battle ; but being informed of the strong position of the Scottish army and of the reso lute spirit with which they awaited his advance, the king submitted to the necessity of the case, and re treated to England.\" The English, who were belea gured in Stirling, after making a brave and obstinate defence, had begun to suffer the extremities of famine.

In the course of the following year, Edward, inde fatigable in the prosecution of his great object, again invaded Scotland, and found that the enemy, profit ing by experience, had adopted that protracted war fare, which was their best security, avoiding a battle, and cutting off his supplies.1 Encamping in Annan dale, he besieged and took Lochmaben, and afterwards sat down before the castle of Caerlaverock, strongly situated on the coast of the Solway Firth. After some resistance, this strength was likewise taken aud garrisoned,2 and the King marched into Galloway, where he had an interview with the bishop of that diocese, who, having in vain attempted to mediate a peace, the Earl of Buchan and John Comyn of Bade noch, repaired personally to Edward, and had a vio lent interview with the king. They demanded that John Baliol, their lawful king, should be permitted peaceably to reign over them ; and that their estates, which had been unjustly bestowed upon his English nobles, should be restored to their rightful lords. Ed ward treated these propositions, which he considered as coming from rebels, with an unceremonious refusal ; and after declaring that they would defend themselves to the uttermost, the king and the Scottish barons parted in high wrath. 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. i. part ii. new edit. p. 920.

During this time, the Scottish army showed itself on the opposite side of the river ; but on being attacked by successive columns, under the Earl of Surry, the Prince of Wales, and the king himself, they rapidly retreated to their impassable morasses and mountains. Through this rough and difficult ground, the heavy armed English soldiers could not penetrate ; and the Welsh, whose familiarity with rocky passes rendered them well-fitted for a warfare of this kind, obstinately refused to act. Baffled in his attempts at pursuit, Edward stationed his head-quarters at Dumfries, and employed himself in taking possession of the different towns and castles of Galloway, and in receiving the submission of the inhabitants of that district.1 Towards the end of October, we still find him at Dumfries ; and having spent five months on an expedition which led to no important success, he found himself compel led, by the approach of winter, to delay till another sea son all his hopes of the entire subjugation of Scotland. Affecting, therefore, to listen, now when it suited his convenience, to the representations of the plenipoten tiaries sent from the King of France, he granted a truce to the Scots ; and with the dissimulation which 1 Rymer, vol. i. new edition, p. 921.

Edward, however, cautiously added, that he acceded to the wishes of Philip, out of favour to him as his dear friend and relative, not as the ally of Scot land ; nor would he give his consent to the cessation of arms, until the ambassadors of Philip agreed to consider it in this light : so careful was he lest any too hasty concession should interrupt his meditated ven geance, when a less refractory army and a milder sea son should allow him to proceed against his enemies.1 The king was induced, by another important event, to grant this truce to the Scots. This was no less than an extraordinary interposition upon the part of the Pope, commanding him, as he reverenced his sacred authority, to desist from all hostilities ; and asserting that the kingdom of Scotland did now belong, and from the most remote antiquity had appertained, to the Holy See. The arguments by which the Roman church supported this singular claim, were, no doubt, suggested by certain Scottish Commissioners, whom Soulis the Regent, in a former part of this year, had sent on a mission to Rome, to complain of the grievous injuries inflicted by Edward upon Scotland, and to request his Holiness's interposition in behalf of their afflicted country.2 Boniface accordingly, influenced, as is asserted, by 1 Fordun a Hearne, p. 983.

After such arguments, his Holiness proceeds to ex hort the king in the name of God, to discharge out of prison and restore to their former liberty all bishops, clerks, and other ecclesiastical persons whom he had incarcerated, and to remove all officers whom by force and fear he had appointed to govern the nation under him ; and he concluded by directing him, if he still pretended any right to the kingdom of Scotland, or to any part thereof, not to omit the sending of com missioners to him fully instructed, and that within six months after the receipt of these letters, he being ever ready to do him justice as his beloved son, and most inviolably to preserve his right.1 In presenting this dignified and imperious man date, the archbishop, in presence of the English nobles and the Prince of Wales, added his own admonitions on the duty of a reverent obedience to so sacred an authority, observing that Jerusalem would not fail to protect her citizens, and to cherish, like Mount Sion, those who trusted in the Lord.

On Win chelsea's re-admission, the king, in a milder and more dignified mood, thus addressed him : \u2014 \" My Lord Archbishop, you have delivered me, on the part of my superior, and reverend father, the Pope, a certain admonition touching the state and realm of Scotland. Since, however, it is the custom of England, that in such matters as relate to the state of that kingdom, advice should be had with all whom they may concern, and since the present business not only affects the state of Scotland, but the rights of England ; and since many prelates, earls, barons, and great men, are now absent from my army, without whose advice I am unwilling finally to reply to my Holy Father, it is my purpose, as soon as possible, to hold a council with my nobility, and by their joint advice and determination, to transmit an answer to his Holiness by messengers of my own.\" It was particularly dangerous for Edward to break with the Pope at this moment, for the peace with France was unconcluded, and Gascony still remain ed in the hands of the Holy See, which had not yet 1 Walsingham, p. 78. - Prynne, Edward I. p. 883."], [203, "1300. INTERREGNUM. 187 decided to whom it should rightly belong. The King of England, therefore, affected to use the most solemn deliberation in the preparation of his answer. He disbanded his army; he summoned a parliament to meet at Lincoln ; he wrote to the Chancellors of both Universities, commanding them to send to this parliament some of their most learned and expert ci vilians, to declare their opinion as to the right of the King of England to be Lord Paramount of Scotland ; and he gave directions to the abbots, priors, and deans of the religious houses in England, that they should diligently search for and examine the ancient chroni cles and archives of their monastery, and collect and transmit to him by some one of their number, not only all matters illustrative of the rights competent to the King of England in the realm of Scotland, but everything which in any way related to that king dom.1 On the meeting of the parliament at Lincoln, the king, after having conciliated the good-will of his no bility, by the confirmation of the great charters of li berties, and of the forests, the last of which he had evaded till now, ordered the Pope's bull to be read to the earls and barons assembled in parliament ; and, after great debates amongst the lawyers who were present, the nobility of England directed a spirited letter to the Pope, with a hundred and four seals ap pended to it.2 In this epistle, after complimenting 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, new edit. vol. i. p. 923. 8 Tyrrel. vol. iii. p. 146."], [204, "188 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1301. the Holy Roman Church upon the judgment and caution with which she respected and inviolably pre- served the rights of every individual, they proceed to remark, that a letter from the Holy See had been shown to them by their lord, King Edward, relating to certain matters touching the state and realm of Scotland, which contained divers wonderful and hi- therto unheard-of propositions. It was notorious, they remark, in these parts of the world, that from the very first original of the kingdom of England, the kings thereof, as well in the times of the Britons as of the Saxons, enjoyed the superiority and direct do- minion of the kingdom of Scotland, and continued either in actual or in virtual possession of the same through successive ages. They further declare, that in temporals, the kingdom of Scotland did never, by any colour of right, belong to the Church of Rome ; that it was an ancient fief of the crown and kings of England, and that the kings of Scotland, with their kingdom, had been subject only to the kings of Eng- land, and to no other. That with regard to their rights, or other temporalities in that kingdom, the kings of England have never answered, nor ought they to answer, before any ecslesiastical or secular judge, and this on account of the freedom and pre- eminence of their royal dignity, and the custom to this effect observed through all ages. Wherefore they conclude, \u2014 having diligently considered the let- ters of his Holiness, it is now, and for the future shall be, the unanimous and unshaken resolution of all and every one of them, that their lord the king, concern-"], [205, "1301.

And they added, \" that they would not permit the king to do, or even to attempt, such strange and un heard-of things, even if he were willing so far to for get his royal rights. Wherefore they reverently and humbly entreat his Holiness to permit the king to possess his rights in peace, without diminution or disturbance.

A pilgrimage to the shrine of St Thomas a Becket, and other holy places, was undertaken by the king previous to his putting himself at the head of his army ; and this being concluded, he passed the borders, and besieged and took the Castle of Bonkill in the Merse. The Scots contented themselves with laying waste the country ; and aware of the hazard of risking a battle, they attacked the straggling parties of the English, 1 Tyrrel, vol. iii. p. 147.

An early winter set in with extreme severity, and many of the large war-horses of the English knights perished from cold and hunger ; but Edward, who knew that the Scots only waited for his absence, to rise into rebellion, determined to pass the winter at Linlithgow. Here, accordingly, he built a castle,2 established the head quarters of his army, and kept his Christmas with his son and his nobles. The treaty of peace between Edward and Philip of France was still unconcluded ; and as Philip conti nued a warm advocate for Baliol and the Scots, Ed ward, moved by his remonstrances, gave authority to his envoys at the French court to conclude a truce with Scotland, under certain conditions.3 The en voys, however, were sharply reproved by the king and his nobles, for giving the title of King of Scots to Baliol, and permitting, as the basis of the truce, the alliance between France and his enemies.4 Edward 1 Chron.

Having concluded this truce at Linlithgow, Edward proceeded to Roxburgh, and from this, by Morpeth and Durham, returned to London.1 The perseverance and courage of the Scots were ill supported by their faithless allies. Boniface soon de serted them, and with extreme effrontery, forgetting his former declarations, addressed a letter of admoni tion to Wisheart, the Bishop of Glasgow, command ing him to desist from all opposition to Edward. Wisheart had been delivered from an English prison some time before, and, on taking a solemn oath of fealty, had been received into favour ; but unable to quench his love of liberty, or perhaps of intrigue, he had recommenced his opposition to the English, and the Pope addresses him as the \" prime mover and in stigator of all the tumult aud dissension which has arisen between his dearest son in Christ, Edward, King of England, and the Scots.\" ' At the same time his Holiness, with the like inconsistency, addressed a Rymer, F\u0153d. vol. i. new edition, p. 938, signed at Linlithgow, 26th Jan. 1302 ?

ButPhilip, having been defeated in Flanders, became anxious at all risks to conclude a peace with England, and to concentrate his efforts for the reduction of the revolted Flemings.3 Edward, who had hitherto sup ported the Flemings, entertained the same wish to direct his undivided strength against the Scots, and a mutual sacrifice for allies was the consequence. Thc English King paved the way for this, by excluding the Earl of Flanders from the number of his allies, in the former truce ratified at Linlithgow ; and Philip, in return, not only left out the Scots in the new truce concluded at Amiens, but entirely excluded them in the subsequent and final treaty of peace, not long afterwards concluded at Paris.4 Previous, however, to the conclusion of this treaty, so fatal to the Scots, the army of Edward experienced a signal defeat near Edinburgh. 1 Rymer, vol. i.

John de Segrave had been appointed Governor of Scotland, and Edward, much incensed at the conti nued and determined animosity of the Scots, who, on the expiry of the truce, had recommenced the war with great vigour, directed letters to Ralph Fitz- William, and twenty-six of his principal barons. By these he informed them, that he had received intelli gence from Segrave of the success of his enemies, who, after ravaging the country, and reducing, burning, and seizing his towns and castles, threatened, unless put down with a strong hand, to invade and lay waste England. \" For which reason,\" adds the king, \" we request, by the fealty and love which bind you to us, that you will instantly repair to John de Segrave, with your whole assembled power of horse and foot.\" He then informs them of his resolution to be with his army in Scotland sooner than he at first intended, and that, in the meantime, he had dispatched thither Ralph de Manton, his clerk of the wardrobe, who would pay them their allowances, and act as his trea surer as long as they continued on the expedition.1 Segrave marched from Berwick towards Edinburgh, about the beginning of Lent, with an army of twenty thousand men,2 chiefly consisting of cavalry, com manded by some of Edward's best and oldest leaders. Amongst these were Segrave's brothers, very gallant knights,3 and Robert de Neville, a noble baron, who 1 Rymer, Feed. vol. i. new edit, part ii. p. 947.

The first division was led by Segrave himself, the second probably by Ralph de Manton, who, in virtue of his office as paymaster, was called Ralph the Cofferer, the third by Neville. Early in the morning of the 24th February, Segrave and his sol- diers were slumbering in their tents, in careless secu- rity, when a boy rushed in, and called out that the enemy were upon them. The news proved true. Sir John Comyn the Governor, and Sir Simon Fraser, hearing of the advance of the English, had collected a small army of eight thousand horse, and marching in the night from Biggar to Roslin, surprised the ene- my in their encampment. Segrave's division was en- tirely routed, he himself, after a severe wound, was made prisoner, along with sixteen knights, and thirty esquires, his brother and son were seized in bed, and the Scots had begun to collect the booty, and calcu- late on the ransom, when the second division of the English army appeared. A cruel but necessary or der was given to slay the prisoners ; and this having been done, the Scots immediately attacked the ene my, who, after an obstinate defence, were put to flight with great slaughter. The capture of Ralph the Cof- 1 Rymer, vol. i. new edit. p. 608. Trivet, p. 336."], [212, "196 1302.

Worn out by their night march, aud fatigued by two successive attacks, the little army of the Scots thought of an immediate re treat. But this, probably, the proximity of Neville's division rendered impossible ; and after again resort ing to the same horrid policy of putting to death their prisoners, an obstinate conflict began, which termi nated in the death of Neville, and the total defeat of his division.1 There occurred in this battle a stri king but cruel trait of national animosity. Ralph the Cofferer had been taken prisoner by Sir Simon Fraser, and this paymaster of Edward, though a priest, like many of the ecclesiastics and bishops of those fierce times, preferred the coat of mail to the surplice. On the order being given to slay the prisoners, Sir Ralph begged his life might be spared, and promised a large ransom. \" This laced hauberk is no priestly habit,\" observed Fraser ; \" where is thine albe, or thy hood ? Often have you robbed us of our lawful wages, and doue us grievous harm. It is now our turn to sum up the account, and exact its payment.\" Saying this, he first struck off the hands of the unhappy priest, and then severed his head with one blow from his body.2 The remains of the English army fled to Edward, 1 See Notes and Illustrations, letter N. s Langtoft, vol. ii. p. 319."], [213, "1J02. INTERREGNUM. 197 in England, and the Scots, after reposing from their fatigues, collected and divided their booty, which was exceeding rich both in armour and in prisoners, and returned home with honour.' This persevering bravery of the Scots in defence of their country, was unfortunately united to a credulity which made them the dupes of the insidious policy of Philip. Although left out of the treaty concluded at Amiens, the French monarch had the address to persuade the Scottish deputies then at Paris, that having concluded his own affairs with Edward, he would devote his whole efforts to mediate a peace be tween his allies and their enemies ; and he entreated them, in the meantime, to remain with him at the French court, until they could carry back to Scot land intelligence of his having completed the negotia tion with Edward on behalf of themselves and their countrymen. The object of Philip, in all this, was to prevent the return of the deputies, amongst whom were some of the most warlike and influential of the Scottish nobles, previous to the expedition which Ed ward was about to lead against their country. Un suspicious of any treachery, they consented to remain, and in the meantime they directed a letter to the Governor and nobility of Scotland, in which they en couraged them to be of good courage, and to perse vere in their defence of the liberties of their country. \" You would greatly rejoice,\" they say in this letter, \" if you were aware what a weight of honour this last 1 Wynton, vol. ii. p. 117."], [214, "198 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1303. conflict with the English has conferred upon you throughout the world. Wherefore, we beseech you earnestly, that you continue to be of good courage. And if the King of England consents to a truce, as we firmly expect he will, do you likewise agree to the same, according to the form which the ambassadors of the King of France shall propose by one of our num ber, who will be sent to you. But if the King of England, like Pharaoh, shall grow hardened, and con* tinue the war, we beseech you, by the mercy of Christ, that you quit yourselves like men, so that by the as sistance of God, and your own courage, you may gain the victory.\" \\ To gain the victory, however, over the determined perseverance and overwhelming military strength of the English king, was no easy task. The distress of Scotland, from its exposure to the continued ravages of war, had reached a pitch which the people of the land could endure no longer. They became heart broken for a time, under a load of misery and suffer ing, from which they could see no relief but in absolute submission; the Governor Comyn, the late Guardian Wallace, and the few patriot nobles who were still in the field, found it impossible to keep an army toge ther, and all men felt assured that the entire subju gation of the country was an event which no human power could possibly prevent or delay. If Edward, at this crisis, again resumed the war, it was evident that nothing could oppose him. We may judge then 1 Rymer, Feed. vol. i. new edit. p. 955, June 8, 1303."], [215, "1303. INTERREGNUM. 199 of the desolating feelings of this devoted land, when word was brought that the King of England had once more collected the whole armed force of his dominions, and, leading his army in person, had passed the Bor der. The recent defeat at Roslin had chafed and in flamed his passions to the utmost, and he declared that it was his determined purpose either to reduce the country to entire subjection, or to raze it utterly with fire and sword, and turn it to a desert, fit only for the beasts of the field. In recording the history of this last miserable campaign, the historian has to tell a tale of heart-broken submission, and pitiless ra vage ; he has little to do but to follow in dejection the chariot wheels of the conqueror, and to hear them crushing under their iron weight all that was free, and hrave, and true-hearted, in the land of his fathers. Edward separated his army into two divisions. He gave the command of one to his eldest son, the Prince of Wales, who directed his march westward into Scot land,1 whilst the king himself, at the head of the se cond division, proceeded eastward by Morpeth and Roxburgh, and reached the capital without chal lenge or interruption in the beginning of June 1303. The whole course of the king, as well as that of the prince, was marked by smoke and devastation, by the plunder of towns and villages, the robbery of granges and garners, the flames of woods, and the destruction of the small tracts of cultivated lands which yet re mained. Wherever he turned his arms, the inhabit- !

From Edinburgh Edward continued his victorious progress by Linlithgow and Clackmannan to Perth, and afterwards by Dundee and Brechin proceeded to Aberdeen. From this city, pursuing his march north ward, he reached Banff, and from thence he push ed on to Kinloss in Moray. Leaving this, he struck into the heart of Moray, and for some time establish ed his quarters at Lochendorb, a fortress strongly situated upon an island in a lake.1 Here Edward re ceived the oaths and homage of the northern parts of the kingdom,2 and, it is probable, added to the fortifi cations of the castle. It is curious to find that, after a lapse of near five hundred years, the memory of this great king is still preserved in the tradition of the neighbourhood ; and that the peasant, when he points out to the traveller the still massy and noble remains of Lochindorb, mentions the name of Edward I. as connected in some mysterious way with their history. From this remote strength, the king, penetrating into Aberdeenshire, reached the strong and important castle of Kildrummie in Garvyach,3 from whence he 1 See Notes and Illustrations, letter O. 2 Fordun a Hearne, p. 989. 3 He was at Kildrummie on the 8th of October 1303, and at Dundee on the 20th of the same month.

Thence, probably by Perth, he marched to Stirling and Cambusken neth, visited Kinross, and finally proceeded to take up his winter quarters at Dunfermline early in the month of December, where he was joined by his queen.1 In this progress, the castle of Brechin shut its gates against him. It was commanded by Sir Thomas Maule, a Scottish knight of signal intrepidi ty, and such was the impregnable nature of the walls that the battering engines of the king could not for many days make the least impression. So confident was Maule of this, that he stood on the ramparts, and in derision of the English soldiers below, wiped off with a towel the dust and rubbish raised by the stones thrown from the English engines.2 At last this brave man was struck down by one of the missiles he affect ed to despise, and the wound proved mortal. When he lay dying on the ground, some of his soldiers asked him if now they might surrender the castle. Though life was ebbing, the spirit of the soldier indignantly revived at this proposal, and pronouncing maledictions on their cowardice, he expired. The castle imme diately opened its gates to the English, after having stood a siege of twenty days. Edward was employed at Dunfermline in receiving the submission of those Scottish barons and great men who had not made their peace during his late progress through the king- 1 Langtoft, p. 322. 2 \" Stetit ille Thomas cum manutergio et extrusit C\u0153suram de Muro in subsannationem ct derisum totius exercitus Anglicani.\" M.

When at this place, his soldiers, by orders of the king, with savage barbarity destroyed a Benedic tine monastery of such noble dimensions, that an English historian informs us, three kings, with their united retinues, might have lodged within its walls. On account of its ample size the Scottish nobles had often held their parliaments within its great hall. This was a sufficient crime in the eyes of the king. The church of the monastery, with a few cells for the monks, were spared ; the rest was razed to the ground. Comyn the Governor, along with Sir Simon Fraser, and a few barons, still kept up a show of resistance ; and Wallace, who, since his abdication of the supreme power in the state, had continued his determined op position to Edward, lurked with a small band in the woods and mountains. The castle of Stirling, also, still held out, and as it was certain that the king would besiege it, Comyn, with the faint hope of de fending the passage of the Forth, collected as many soldiers as he could muster, and encamped on the ground where Wallace had gained his signal victory over Cressingham and Surry. But the days of victory were past. Edward, the moment he heard of this, ford ed the river in person at the head of his cavalry, and routed and dispersed the last remnant of an army on which the hopes of Scotland depended. The king had intended to pass the river by the bridge, but on co ming forward he found it had been broken down aud burnt by the Scots. Had their leaders profited by the lesson taught them by Wallace, they would have kept up thc bridge, and attacked Edward when defi-"], [219, "1303. 203 INTERREGNUM. ling over it ; but their rashness in destroying it com pelled the king to find a ford, and enabled him to pass the river in safety.1 Soon after this expiring effort, the Governor, with all his adherents, submitted to Edward. The Earls of Pembroke and Ulster, with Sir Henry Percy, met Comyn at Strathorde in Fife,2 on the 9th of February, and a solemn negotiation took place, in which the late regent and his followers, after stipulating for the preservation of their lives, liberties, and lands, de livered themselves up to Edward, and agreed to the infliction of any pecuniary fine which he should think right. The castles and strengths of Scotland were to remain in the hands of Edward, and the government of the country to be modelled and administered at his pleasure. From this negotiation those were specially excepted, for whom, as more obstinate in their rebel lion, the King of England reserved a more signal punishment. In this honourable roll we find Wish eart, Bishop of Glasgow, James, the Steward of Scot land, Sir John Soulis, the late associate of Comyn in the government of the kingdom, David de Graham, Alexander de Lindesay, Simon Fraser, Thomas Bois, and William AVallace.3 To all these persons, except Wallace, certain terms, more or less rigorous, were held out, on accepting which, Edward guaranteed to them their lives and their liberty ; and We know that 1 Notes and Illustrations, letter Q. 2 Strathurd, or Strathord, on the Ord water in Fife, perhaps now Struthers. 3 Prynne, Hist, Edward I, pp. 1120\u2014 1I2I.J"], [220, "204 1303.

But of this great man a rigorous exclusion was made. \" As for William Wallace,\" says the deed, \" it is covenant ed, that if he thinks proper to surrender himself, it must be unconditionally to the will and mercy of our lord the king.\" Such a surrender, it is well known, gave Edward the unquestionable right of ordering his victim to instant execution. An English parliament was soon after appointed to meet at St Andrews, to which the king summoned the Scottish barons who had again come under his al legiance. This summons was obeyed by all except Sir Simon Fraser and Wallace, and these two brave men, along with the garrison of Stirling, which still defied the efforts of the English, were declared outlaws by the vote, not only of the English barons, but with the extorted consent of their broken and dispirited coun trymen.1 At length Fraser, despairing of being able again to rouse the spirit of the nation, consented to accept the hard conditions of fine and banishment offered him by the conqueror, and Wallace found himself standing alone against Edward, excepted from all amnesty, and inexorably marked for death.2 Surrounded by his ene mies, he came from the fastnesses where he had taken refuge to the forest of Dunfermline, and by the me diation of his friends, proposed on certain conditions to surrender himself.

When reported to Edward he broke out into ungovernable rage, cursed him by the fiend as a traitor, pronounced his malediction on all who sustained or supported him, and set a reward of three hundred merks upon his head. On hearing this, Wallace betook himself again to the wilds and mountains, and subsisted on plun der.1 The castle of Stirling was now the only fortress which had not opened its gates to Edward.

Thirteen war like engines were brought by the besiegers to bear upon the walls.2 The missiles which they threw con sisted of leaden balls of great size, with huge stones, and javelins, and the leaden roof of the cathedral of 1 Prynne, Edward I. p. 1051. - \" Threttene great engynes, of all the reame the best, Brouht thei to Strivelyne, the kastelle down to kest.\" Langtoft, p. 325."], [223, "1304.

During all this, Edward, although his ad- vanced age might have afforded him an excuse for caution, exposed his person with an almost youthful rashness. Mounted on horseback, he rode beneath the walls to make his observations, and was more than once struck by the stones and javelins thrown from the engines on the ramparts. One day, when riding so near that he could distinguish the soldiers who worked the balist\u00e6, a javelin struck him on the breast, and lodged itself in the steel plates of his armour. The king with his own hand plucked out the dart, which had not pierced the skin, and shaking it in the air, called out aloud, that he would hang the villain who had hit him.2 On another occasion, when riding within the range of the engines, a stone of great size and weight fell so near, with such noise and force, that the king's horse backed and fell with his master ; upon which some of the soldiers, seeing his danger, ran in, and forced Edward down the hill towards the tents.3 Whilst these engines within the castle did so much execution, those of Edward, being of small dimensions in comparison with the height of the walls, 1 Fordun a Hearne, p. 990. 3 Math.

The siege had now continued from the twenty second of April to the twentieth of May, without much impression having been made. But determina tion was a marked feature in the powerful character of the king. He wrote to the sheriffs of York, Lin coln, and London, commanding them to purchase and send instantly to him, at Stirling, all the ba list\u00e6, quarrells, bows and arrows, which they could collect within their counties ; and he dispatched a letter to the governor of the Tower, requiring him to send down, with all haste, the balist\u00e6 and small quarrells which were under his charge in that for tress.1 Anxious for the assistance and presence of all his best soldiers, he published, at Stirling, an inhibition, proclaiming that no knight, esquire, or other person whatsoever, should frequent jousts or tournaments, or go in search of adventures and deeds of arms, without his special license ;2 and aware that the Scottish garrison must soon be in want of provisions, he cut off all communication with the surrounding country, and not only pressed the siege with renewed vigour, but gave orders for the erection of two immense engines, which, unlike those employed at first, over- 1 Rymer, new edition, vol. i. p. 963. ~ Rymer, new edition, p. 964.

The first of these was a complicated machine, which, al- though much pains was bestowed on its construction, did no great execution ; but the second, which the soldiers called the wolf, was more simple in its form, and, from its size and strength, most murderous in its effects. By means of these, a large breach was made in the two inner walls of the castle ; and the outer ditch having been filled up with heaps of stones and faggots thrown into it, Edward ordered a general as- sault. The brave little garrison, which for three months had successfully resisted the whole strength of the English army, were now greatly reduced by fa- mine and the siege. Their provisions were exhaust- ed. Thirteen women, the wives and sisters of the knights and barons who defended the place, were shut up, along with the garrison, and their distress and misery became extreme. In these circumstances, their walls cast down, the engines carrying the soldiers wheeled up to the breach, and the scaling ladders fix- ed on the parapet, a deputation was sent to Edward, with an offer to capitulate, on security of life and limb. This proposal the king met with contempt and scorn, but he agreed to treat on the terms of an uncon ditional surrender, and appointed four of his barons, the Earls of Gloucester and Ulster, with Sir Eustace le Poor, and Sir John de Mowbray, to receive the last resolution of the besieged. Sir John and Sir Eustace accordingly proceeded VOL. I.

At this meeting they consented for themselves and their companions, to sur render unconditionally to the King of England ; and they earnestly requested that he would permit them to make this surrender in his own presence, and him self witness their contrition. To this Edward agreed, and forthwith appointed Sir John Lovel to fill the place of governor. A me lancholy pageant of feudal submission now succeeded. Sir William Olifant, and, along with him, twenty-five of the knights and gentlemen, his companions in the siege, presented themselves before the king, who re ceived them in princely state, surrounded by his nobles and warriors. In order to save their lives, these brave men were compelled to appear in a garb and posture, against which every kind and generous feeling revolts. Their persons were stript to their shirts and drawers ; their heads and feet were bare ; their hair hung matted 1 It is asserted, both by Fordun a Hearne, p. 991, and by Wyn ton, vol. ii. p. 119, that the castle was delivered up to the English on a written agreement signed by Edward, that the garrison should be quit and free of all harm \u2014 which agreement Edward perfidious ly broke. The only ground mentioned in Rymer, new edition, p. 996, which gives some countenance to this accusation, is the fact, that Olifant and Dupplin agreed to surrender according lo ihe terms which had been offered by the Earl of Lincoln, and the record some what suspiciously conceals what these terms were.

Upon this, Edward, of his royal mercy, exempted them from the ignominy of being chained ; but Olifant was sent to the Tower, and the rest were imprisoned in different castles through out England.1 The garrison was found to consist of no more than a hundred and forty soldiers ; an in credibly small number, if we consider that for three months they had resisted the efforts of the army of England, led by the king in person.2 Having thus secured his conquest, by the reduction of the last castle which had resisted his authority ; and having appointed English castellains to the other strengths in Scotland, Edward left the temporary government of that country, to John de Segrave, and, accompanied by the chief of the Scottish nobility, pro ceeded by Selkirk and Jedburgh to Yetholm, upon the borders, and from thence to Lincoln, where he kept his Christmas with great solemnity and rejoi cing.3 The only man in Scotland who had steadily refused submission was AVallace ; and the king, with that in veterate enmity and unshaken perseverance which marked his conduct to his enemies, now used every possible means to hunt him down, and become master of his person. He had already set a large sum upon 1 Rymer, new edition, p. 966. * Hemingford, vol. i. p. 206. See Notes and Illustrations, letter S. 3 Math. West. p. 450.

For this purpose he command ed Sir John de Mowbray, a Scottish knight then at his court, and who seems at this time suddenly to have risen into great trust and favour with Edward, to carry with him into Scotland Ralph de Haliburton, one of the prisoners lately taken at Stirling. Hali burton was ordered to co-operate with the other Scots men who were then engaged in the attempt to seize Wallace, and Mowbray was to watch how this base person conducted himself.1 What were the particu lar measures adopted by Haliburton, or with whom he co-operated, it is now impossible to determine ; but it is certain that, soon after this, Wallace was betray ed and taken by Sir John Menteith, a Scottish baron of high rank. Perhaps we are to trace this infamous transaction to a family feud. At the battle of Fal kirk, Wallace, who, on account of his bold aud over bearing conduct, had never been popular with thc Scottish nobility, opposed the pretensions of Sir John Stewart of Bonkill, when this baron contended for the chief command. In that disastrous defeat, Sis John Stewart, with the flower of his followers, was 1 Ryley, Placita, p. 279.

His site, as was to be expected, was soon decided ; but thc circumstances of refined cruelty and torment which attended his execution, reflect an indelible stain upon the character of Edward, and, were they not stated by the English historians themselves, could scarcely be believed. Having becu carried to Lon don, he was brought with great pomp to Westminster Hall, and there arraigned of treason. A crown of laurel was in mockery placed on his head, because Wallace had been heard to boast that he deserved to wear a crown in that hall. Sir Peter Mallorie, the king's justice, then impeached him as a traitor to the King of England,3 as having burnt the villages and abbeys, stormed the castles, and miserably slain and tortured the liege subjects of his master the king. Wallace indignantly and truly repelled the charge of treason, as he never had sworn fealty to Edward ; but to the other articles of accusation he pleaded no de- 1 Fordun a Hearne, p. 981.

Discrowned and chained, he was now drag ged at the tails of horses through the streets, to the foot of a high gallows, placed at the elms in Smith field.1 After being hanged, hut not to death, he was cut down yet breathing, his bowels taken out, and burnt before his face.2 His head was then struck off, and his body divided into four quarters. His head was placed on a pole on London Bridge, his right arm above the bridge at Newcastle, his left arm was sent to Berwick, his right foot and limb to Perth, and his left quarter to Aberdeen.3 \" These,\" says an old English historian, \" were the trophies of their fa vourite hero, which the Scots had now to contemplate, instead of his banners and gonfanons, which they had once proudly followed.\" But he might have add ed, that they were trophies far more glorious than the richest banner that had ever been borne before him ; and if Wallace already had been, for his daring and romantic character, the idol of the people, if they had long regarded him as the only man who had asserted, throughout every change of circumstances, the inde pendence of his country, now that the mutilated limbs of this martyr to liberty were brought amongst them, it may well be conceived how deep and inextinguish- ble were their feelings of pity and revenge.

The course of events which soon followed this cruel sentence, de monstrates the truth of these remarks. For fifteen years had Edward been employed in the reduction of Scotland, \u2014 Wallace was put to death, \u2014 the rest of the nobility had sworn fealty, \u2014 the fortresses of the land were in the hands of English governors, who acted under an English Guardian, \u2014 a parliament was held at London, where the Scottish nation was repre sented by ten commissioners, and these persons, in concert with twenty English commissioners, created an entirely new machine of government for Scotland. Edward, indeed, affected to disclaim all violent or ca pricious innovations ; and it was pretended, that the new regulations which were introduced, were dictated by the advice of the Scottish nobles, and with a re spect to the ancient laws of the land ; but he took especial care that all that really marked an indepen dent kingdom should be destroyed, and that, whilst the name of authority was given to the Scottish com missioners who were to sit in Parliament, the reality of power belonged solely to himself. Scotland, there fore, might be said to be entirely reduced, aud Ed ward flattered himself that he was now in quiet to en joy that sovereignty which had been purchased by a war of fifteen years, and at an incredible expense of blood and treasure.

Kings qf England. I King of France. Pope. Edward I. Philip IV. I Clement V. Edward II. We now enter upon the history of this great and rapid revolution, and in doing so, it will first be neces sary to say a few words upon the early character and conduct of the Earl of Carrie, afterwards Robert the First. This eminent person was the grandson of that Ro bert Bruce, Lord of Annandale, who was competitor for the crown with John Baliol. He was lineally de scended from Isabella, second daughter of David, Earl of Huntingdon, brother of William the Lion. John Baliol, the late King of Scotland, had, as we have al ready seen, renounced for ever all claim to the throne, and his son Edward was at that time a minor and a captive. Marjory Baliol, the sister of this unfortu nate monarch, married John Comyn, Lord of Bade uoeh. Their son, John Comyn, commonly called thc Red Comyn, thc opponent of Wallace, and, till the"], [234, "218 1305. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. fatal year 1303, the Regent of the kingdom, possess ed, as the son of Baliol's sister, the same claim to the throne as Baliol himself. He was also connected by marriage with the royal family of England,1 and was undoubtedly one of the most powerful, if not the most powerful, subject in Scotland. Bruce and Comyn were thus the heads of two rival parties in the state, whose animosity was excited by their mutual claims to the same crown, and whose interests were utterly irreconcilable. Accordingly, when Edward gave his famous award in favour of Baliol, Bruce, the compe titor, refused to take the oath of homage,2 and al though he acquiesced in the decision, gave up his lands in the vale of Annandale, which he must have held as a vassal under Baliol, to his son, the Earl of Car rie ; again, in 1293, the Earl of Carrie resigned his lands and earldom of Carrie to his son Robert, then a young man in the service of the King of England.3 In the years 1295 and 1296, Edward invaded Scot land, and reduced Baliol, and the party of the Comyns, to an ignominious submission. During this contest, Bruce, the Earl of Carrie, and son of the competitor, possessed of large estates in England, continued faith ful to Edward. He thus preserved his estates, and hoped to see thc destruction of the only rivals who 1 His wife Johanna, was daughter of William de Valence, Earl of Pembroke. This Earl of Pembroke was son of Hugh de Brienne, who married Isabella, widow of John, King of England, grandfather of Edward the First. 2 Leland, Collect, vol. i. 540. 3 Ibid."], [235, "1305. 219 ROBERT BRUCE. stood between him and his claim to the throne. Nor was this a vain expectation, for Edward, on hearing of the revolt of Baliol and the Comyns, undoubtedly held out the prospect of the throne to Bruce,1 and these circumstances afford us a complete explanation of the inactivity of that baron and his son at this period. Meanwhile Baliol and the Comyns issued a hasty order, confiscating the estates of all who pre served their allegiance to Edward. In consequence of this resolution, the rich lordship of Annandale, the paternal inheritance of the Earl of Carrie, was declared forfeited, and given by Baliol to John Co myn, Earl of Buchan, who immediately seized and occupied Bruce's castle of Lochmaben, an insult which there is reason to think the proud baron never for gave. Compelled to submit to Edward, the Comyns, and the principal nobles who supported them, were now carried prisoners into England ; and, when re stored to liberty, it was only on condition that they should join his army in Flanders, and assist him in his foreign wars.2 During the brief but noble stand made by Wal lace for the national liberty, Robert Bruce, then a young man of three-and-twenty, was placed in very difficult and critical circumstances. It was in his favour that his rivals, the Comyns, were no longer in the field, but kept in durance by Edward. His fa ther, the Earl of Carrie, remained in England, where 1 See supra, p. 107. s Rotul. Scoti\u00e6, 30lh July. Edward I."], [236, "220 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1305. he possessed large estates, and continued faithful in his allegiance to the king. At this time it is import ant to remark what Walter Hemingford, a contem porary English historian, has said of young Bruce. After mentioning the revolt which was headed by Wallace, he informs us, \" that the Bishop of Carlisle, and other barons, to whom the peace of that district was committed, became suspicious of the fidelity of Robert Bruce the younger, Earl of Carrie, and sent for him to come and treat upon the affairs of Ed ward, if he intended to remain faithful to that mo narch.\" Bruce, he continues, did not dare to disobey, but came on the day appointed, with his vassals of Galloway, and took an oath on the sacred host, and upon the sword of St Thomas, that he would assist the king against the Scots, and all his enemies, both by word and deed ; and having taken this oath, he re turned to his country, and to give a colour of truth to his fidelity, collected his vassals, and ravaged the lands of William Douglas, carrying the wife and infant chil dren of this knight into Annandale. Soon after this, however, as he returned from a meeting of the Scottish conspirators to his own country, having assembled his father's men of Annandale, (for his father himself then resided in the south of England, and was igno rant of his son's treachery,) he told them, \" that it was true he had lately taken a foolish oath at Car lisle, of which they had heard.\" He assured them that it was extorted by force, and that he not only deeply repented what he had done, but hoped soon to get absolution. Meanwhile he added, \" that he"], [237, "1305. ROBERT BRUCE. 221 was resolved to go with his own vassals and join the nation from which he sprung, and he earnestly en treated them to do the same, and come along with him as his dear friends and counsellors. The men of Annandale, however, disliking the peril of this un dertaking, whilst their master, the elder Bruce, was in England, decamped in the night ; and the young Bruce, aspiring to the crown, as was generally re ported, joined himself to the rebels, and entered into the conspiracy with the Bishop of Glasgow, and the Steward of Scotland, who were at the bottom of thc plot.\"1 Such is an almost literal translation from the words of Walter- Hemingford, whose information as to Scottish affairs at this period, seems to have been minute and accurate. At this time, however, the ambition or the patri otic feelings of Bruce, were indeed shortlived ; for not many months after, he made his peace at the capitu lation at Irvine, and gave his infant daughter, Mar jory, as a hostage for his fidelity.2 After the successful battle of Stirling, the Comyns, no longer in the power of the English king, joined Wallace ; and young Bruce, once more seeing his rivals for the throne oppo sed to Edward, kept aloof from public affairs, anxious, 1 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 120. 2 Rymer, Feed. vol. i. new edit. p. 868. Robert Bruce, Earl of Carrie, James the Steward of Scotland, John his brother, Alex ander de Lindesay, and William de Douglas, submitted themselves to Edward. On 30th July 1297, John Comyn, son of John, Lord of Badenoch, John, Earl of Athol, and Richard Suvard, were libe rated from prison, and accompanied Edward to Flanders,"], [238, "222 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1305. no doubt, that they should destroy themselves by such opposition. He did not, as Lord Hailes has errone ously stated, accede to the Scottish party,1 but on the contrary, shut himself up in the castle of Ayr, and refused to join the army which fought at Falkirk. As little, however, did he cordially co-operate with Ed ward, although his father, the elder Bruce, and his brother, Bernard Bruce, were both in the service of Edward, and, as there is strong reason to believe, in the English army which fought at Falkirk. Young Bruce's conduct, in short, at this juncture, was that of a cautious neutral ; but Edward, who approved of no such lukewarmness in those who had sworn ho mage to him, immediately after the battle of Falkirk advanced into the west. Bruce, on his approach, fled, and Edward afterwards led his army into Annandale, and seized his strong castle of Lochmaben.2 In a parliament held not long after, the king gave to his nobles some of the estates of the chief men in Scotland ; but the great estates of the Bruce family, embracing Annandale and Carrie, were not alienated. The fidelity of the elder Bruce to Edward, in all pro bability preserved them. On the 13th of November 1299, we find Robert Bruce the younger, Earl of Car rie, associated as one of the Regents of the kingdom, with John Comyn, that powerful rival, with whom he had hitherto never acted in concert.3 It seems, how- 1 Annals, vol. i. 4to, pp. 256\u2014263. 2 Hemingford, p. 166. 3 Rymer, new edit. p. 915."], [239, "1305. ROBERT BRUCE. 223 ever, to have been an unnatural coalition, arising more out of Bruce having lost the confidence of Edward, than indicative of any new cordiality between him and Comyn ; and there can be little doubt also, that they were brought to act together, by a mutual desire to humble and destroy the power of Wallace, in which they succeeded. But to punish this union, Edward, in his short campaign of 1300, wasted Annandale, took Lochmaben castle, and marched into Galloway, ravaging Bruce's country. Thus exposed to, and suf fering under, the vengeance of the King of England, it might be expected that he should have warmly joined with his brother regents in the war with England. But this seems not to have been the case. He did not take an active share in public affairs, and, previous to the battle of Roslin, he returned, as we have seen, to the English party. During the fatal and victorious progress of Edward through Scotland in 1303, he remained faithful to Edward, while his rivals, the Comyns, continued in arms against Eng land. On the death of his father, which took place in 1304, Bruce was permitted by the King of Eng land to take possession of his whole English and Scottish estates ; and so high does he appear to have risen in the esteem of Edward, that he acted a prin cipal part in the settlement of the kingdom in 1304, whilst his rival, Comyn, was subjected to a heavy fine, and seems to have wholly lost the confidence of the king. 1 Trivet, p. 334."], [240, "224 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1305. In this situation matters stood at the important period, when we concluded the last chapter. Bruce, whose conduct had been consistent only upon selfish principles, found himself, when compared with other Scottish barons, in an enviable situation. He had pre served his great estates, his rivals were overpowered, and, on any new emergency occurring, the way was partly cleared for his own claim to the crown. The effect of all this upon the mind of Comyn may be easily imagined. He felt that one, whose con- duct, in consistency and honour, had been inferior to his own, was rewarded with the confidence and favour of the king, whilst he who had struggled to the last for the liberty of his country, became an object of sus- picion and neglect. This seems to have rankled iu his heart, and he endeavoured to instil suspicions of the fidelity of Bruce into the mind of Edward ;: but at the same time he kept up to that proud rival the appearance of friendship and familiarity. Bruce, in the meantime, although he had matured no certain de- sign for the recovery of the crown, never lost sight of his pretensions, and neglected no opportunity of strengthening himself and his cause, by those bonds and alliances with powerful barons or prelates, which were common in that age. He had entered into a secret league of this kind with William de Lamber ton, Bishop of St Andrews, in which they engage faithfully to consult together, and to give mutual as- 1 Hemingford says this expressly. \" Cumque mutuo loqueren tur ad invicem verbis ut videbatur pacificis, statum convertens fa ciem ft verlm pervertens c\u0153pit improperare ei.\" 13"], [241, "1305.

At this meeting, Bruce described in strong expres sions the miserable servitude into which their mutual dissensions, and their respective claims to the crown, had plunged the country ; and we are informed by one of the most ancient and accurate of the contempo rary historians, that he proposed as an alternative to Comyn, either that this baron should make over his great estate to Bruce, on condition of receiving from him in return his cordial assistance in asserting his claim to the crown, or should agree to accept Bruce's lands, and assist him in the recovery of his hereditary kingdom. \" Support my title to the crown,\" said Bruce, \" and I will give you my estate, or give me your estate, and I will support yours.\" 2 Comyn agreed to wave his right, and accept the lands, and in the course 1 See Ayloffe's Calendar of Ancient Charters, p. 295.

These designs, however, were as yet quite immature, and Bruce, who was still unsuspected, and in high confidence with Edward, repaired to the English court. Whilst there, Comyn betrayed him,1 and dispatched letters to Edward, informing him of the designs of Bruce upon the crown. Edward, an xious to unravel the whole conspiracy, had recourse to dissimulation, and the Earl of Carrie continued in apparent favour. But the king had inadvertently dropped some hint of an intention to seize him, and Bruce, having received from his kinsman, the Earl of Gloucester,2 an intimation of his danger, took horse, and, accompanied by a few friends, precipitately fled to Scotland. On the borders they encountered a mes senger hastening to England. His deportment was suspicious, and Bruce ordered him to be questioned and searched. He proved to be an emissary of Comyn's, whom that baron had sent to communicate with Ed ward. He was instantly slain, his letters were seized, and Bruce, in possession of documents which disclosed the treachery of Comyn, pressed forward to his castle 1 Wynton asserts, vol. ii. p. 123, that Comyn betrayed Bruce when he was yet in Scotland, upon which Edward sent for him to. get him into his power ; and that Bruce, suspecting nothing, repaired to London to attend parliament. 2 The Earl of Gloucester is ridiculously enough denominated by Maitland, vol. i. p. 469, Earl Gomer, by Boece called Glomer, which is as absurdly supposed to be a corruption of Montgomery."], [243, "1305. 227 INTERREGNUM. of Lochmaben,1 which he reached on the fifth day after his sudden flight. Here he met his brother, Edward Bruce, and informed him of the perilous cir cumstances in which he was placed.2 It was now the month of February, the time when the English justiciars appointed by Edward were accustomed to hold their courts at Dumfries ; and Bruce, as a free holder of Annandale, was bound to be present. Comyn was also a freeholder in Dumfries-shire, aud obliged to attend on the justiciars, so that in this way those two proud rivals were brought into contact, under circumstances peculiarly irritating.3 They met at Dum fries, and Bruce, burning with ill-dissembled indigna tion, requested a private and solitary interview with Comyn, in the convent of the Minorite Friars. Comyn agreed, and entering the convent, they had not reach ed the high altar, before words grew high and warm, and the young baron losing command of temper, open ly arraigned Comyn of treachery. \" You lie,\" said Comyn ; upon which Bruce instantly stabbed him with his dagger, and hurrying from the sanctuary which he had defiled with blood, rushed into the street, and called \" to horse.\" Lindsay and Kirkpatrick, two of his tried followers, seeing him pale and agitated, de manded the cause. \" I doubt,\" said Bruce, as he threw himself on his horse, \" I have slain Comyn.\" \" Do you doubt ?\" cried Kirkpatrick, fiercely, \" I'll f Wynton, vol. ii. p. 127. 2 Barbour, vol. i. p. 23 3 Hailes' Annals, vol. i. p. 294="], [244, "1305. 228 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. make sure !\" and instantly entered the convent, where he found Comyn still alive, but bleeding, and lying on the steps of the high altar. By this time the noise of the scuffle had alarmed Comyn's friends, and his kinsman, Sir Robert Comyn,1 rushed into the convent, and attempted to save him. But Kirkpatrick slew this new opponent, and having dispatched his dying victim, who could offer no resistance, rejoined his master. Bruce assembled his followers, and took possession of the castle of Dumfries. The English justiciars, who held their court in a hall in the castle, believing their lives to be in danger, barricaded the doors. Bruce ordered the hall to be set fire to, upon which the judges capitulated, and were permitted to depart from Scot land without further molestation.2 All this had passed in the heat of passion, and there seems the greatest probability that the murder of Co myn was entirely unpremeditated. But its conse- 1 There seems some little ambiguity about this knight's name. Hailes, vol. i. p. 291, says he is commonly called Sir Richard, but I know not where he is so named.

Rymer, F\u0153d. p. 810, puts it beyond doubt that his name is Robert. The murder of Comyn happened on Thursday the 10th of February 1305-6. 2 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 220. This historian tells us, that after Bruce had with his followers seized the castle of Dumfries, and ex pelled the justiciars, word was brought him that Comyn was still alive, and had been earned by the friars within the high altar, to confess his sins. Upon which Bruce ordered him to be dragged out, and 6lain on the steps of the altar, so that the altar itself was stained with his blood. This is improbable."], [245, "1305. 229 INTERREGNUM. quences were important in the extreme. Bruce's form er varying and uncertain line of policy, which had arisen out of the hope of preserving, by fidelity to Ed ward, his great estates, aud of seeing his rival crushed by his opposition to England, was at once changed by the murder of Comyn. His whole schemes upon the crown had been laid open to Edward. This was ruin of itself; but, in addition to this, he had with his own hand assassinated the first noble in the realm, and in a place of tremendous sanctity. He had stained the high altar with blood, and had directed against himself, besides the resentment of the power ful friends and vassals of the murdered earl, all the terrors of religion, and the strongest prejudices of the people. The die, however, was cast, and he had no alternative left to him, but either to become a fu gitive and an outlaw, or to raise open banner against Edward ; and, although the disclosure of his plans was premature, to proclaim his title to the crown. Having determined on this last, he repaired imme diately to Lochmaben castle, and dispatched letters to his friends and adherents. It was most fortunate for him at this trying crisis, that he had secured the friendship and assistance of the Archbishop of St An drews, William de Lamberton, by one of those bands or covenants, which, in this age, it was considered an unheard of outrage to break or disregard. Lamber ton's friendship, disarmed of its dreadful consequences that sentence of excommunication which was soon thundered against him, and his powerful influence"], [246, "1305. 230 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. necessarily interested in his behalf the whole body of the Scottish clergy. The desperate nature of Bruce's undertaking ap peared very manifest, from the small number of ad herents who joined his banner. The enumeration will not occupy much space. There were the Earls of Lennox and of Athol ; Lamberton, the Bishop of St Andrews ; Robert Wisheart, Bishop of Glasgow ; the Abbot of Scone ; his four brothers, Edward, Ni gel, Thomas, and Alexander ; his nephew, Thomas Randolph ; his brother-in-law, Christopher Seaton ; Gilbert de la Haye of Errol, with his brother, Hugh de la Haye ; David Barclay of Cairns ; Alexander Fraser, brother of Simon Fraser, of Oliver castle ; Walter de Somerville, of Linton and Carnwath ; David of Inchmartin ; Robert Boyd ; and Robert Fleming. Such was the handful of brave men, com prising two earls and only fourteen barons, with whose assistance Bruce determined to take the field against the overwhelming power of England, directed by one of the most experienced statesmen, and certainly by the most successful military commander, of the age. \" With these,\" says the authentic and affectionate Fordun, \" he had the courage to raise his hand, not only against the King of England and his allies, but against the whole accumulated power of Scotland, with the exception of an extremely small number who ad hered to him, and who seemed like a drop of water when compared to the ocean.\"1 1 \" There is no living man,\" continues the historian, \" who is able to narrate the story of those complicated misfortunes which"], [247, "1305. 231 INTERREGNUM. Bruce's first step was bold and decisive. He de termined immediately to be crowned at Scone, and for this purpose repaired from his castle of Lochma ben to Glasgow, where he was joined by many friends who supported his enterprise. On the road from Loch maben, a young knight, well armed and horsed, en countered his retinue, who, the moment Bruce ap proached, threw himself from his horse, and with bent knee did homage to him as his rightful sovereign. He immediately recognised him to be Sir James Dou glas, the son of William, the fourth Lord Douglas. whose estate had been given by Edward to the Lord Clifford, and affectionately welcomed him ; for his fa ther had fought with Wallace, and the son had already befell him in the commencement of this war, his frequent perils, his retreats, the care and weariness, the hunger and thirst, the watch ing and fasting, the cold and nakedness to which he exposed his person, the exile into which he was driven, the snares and ambushes which he escaped, the seizure, imprisonment, the execution, and ut ter destruction of bis dearest friends and relatives. . . . And if in addition to these almost innumerable and untoward events, which he ever bore with a cheerful and unconquered spirit, any man should undertake to describe his individual conflicts and personal successes, those courageous and single-handed combats, in which, by the fa vour of God, and his own great strength and courage, he would often penetrate into the thickest of the enemy, now becoming the assailant, and cutting down all who opposed him ; at another time acting on the defensive, and evincing equal talents in escaping from what seemed inevitable death; if any writer shall do this, he will prove, if I am not mistaken, that he had no equal in his own time, either in knightly prowess, or in strength and vigour of body.\" \u2014 Fordun a Hearne, p. 998, vol. v."], [248, "232 1306. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. shown some indications of his future greatness. Dou glas immediately joined the little band who rode with Bruce, and thus commenced a friendship, which, after a series of as noble services as ever subject paid to sovereign, was not dissolved even by death ; for it was to this young knight, that in after years his dying mas ter committed his heart to be carried to Jerusalem.1 From Glasgow, Bruce rode to Scone, and there was solemnly crowned, on Friday, the 27th of March. Edward had carried off the ancient regalia of the kingdom, and the famous stone chair, in which, ac cording to ancient custom, the Scottish kings were inaugurated. But the ready care of Wisheart, Bi shop of Glasgow, supplied from his own wardrobe the robes in which Robert appeared at his corona tion, and a slight coronet of gold,2 probably borrow ed by the Abbot of Scone from some of the saints or kings which adorned his abbey, was employed in stead of the hereditary crown. A banner, wrought with the arms of Baliol, was delivered by the Bishop of Glasgow to the new king, and Robert received be neath it the homage of the earls and knights who at tended the ceremony. On the second day after the 1 Barbour, by Jamieson, vol. i. p. 27. 2 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. ii. p. 1048.

ROBERT BRUCE. 233 coronation, and before Bruce and his friends had left Scone, they were surprised by the sudden arrival of Isabella, Countess of Buchan, sister of the Earl of Fife, who immediately claimed the right of crowning the king. It was a right which had undoubtedly be longed to the earls of Fife from the days of Malcolm Canmore ; and as the Earl of Fife was at this time of the English party, the countess, a romantic and high-spirited woman, absconding from her husband, joined Bruce at Scone, bringing with her the war horses of her lord.1 The new king was not in a con dition to think lightly of anything of this nature. To have refused Isabella's request, might give to his enemies some colour for alleging, that an essential part of ancient custom and solemnity had been omit ted in his coronation. The English historians would have us believe that this enterprising woman was in fluenced by tenderer feelings than ambition or policy, but this is extremely doubtful. It is certain, that on the 29th of March, the crown was a second time placed on the head of Robert by the hands of the countess,2 who afterwards suffered severely for her al leged presumption. Bruce next made a progress through various parts of Scotland, strengthening his party by the accession of new partizans, seizing some of the castles and towns which were in the possession of the English, 1 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 220. 1 Trivet, p. 342. See Notes and Illustrations, letter V."], [250, "234 1306- HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. committing to prison the sheriffs and officers of Ed ward,1 and creating so great a panic, that many of the English fled precipitately from the country. His party, nevertheless, was exceeding small ; the Co myns possessed the greatest power in Scotland, and they and their followers opposed him, not only from motives of policy, but with the deepest feelings of feudal enmity aud revenge ; while many earls and barons, who had suffered iu the late wars, preferred the quiet of submission, to the repeated hazards of insurrection and revolt. Edward had returned to Winchester, from a plea sure tour through the comities of Dorset and Hamp shire, when he received the intelligence of the mur der of Comyn, and the revolt of Bruce. Although not an aged man, he had reached the mature period of sixty-five ; and a constant exposure to the fatigues of war, had begun to tell upon a constitution of great natural strength. He was become unwieldy, and so infirm that he could not mount on horseback or lead his armies ; and after twenty years of ambitious in trigue, and almost uninterrupted war, now that he was in the decline of his strength and years, he found his Scottish conquests about to be wrested from him by a rival, in whom he had placed the greatest con fidence. But although broken in body, this great king was in his mind and spirit yet vigorous and un impaired, as was completely evinced by the rapidity 1 Rymer, Feed. vol. ii. p. 988."], [251, "1306. ROBERT BRUCE. 235 and decision of his immediate orders, and the subse quent magnitude of his preparations. He instantly sent to strengthen the frontier garrisons of Berwick and Carlisle, with the intent of securing the English bor ders on that side from invasion ; and he appointed the Earl of Pembroke, along with Lord Robert Clif ford and Henry Percy, to march into Scotland with a small army, directing them to proceed against his rebels in that kingdom.1 This was in an especial de gree the age of chivalry, and Edward, who had him self gained his spurs in Palestine, availed himself of that imposing system to give greater spirit to his in tended expedition. He published a manifesto, de claring his intention of bestowing knighthood upon his son, the Prince of Wales ; and he caused it to be proclaimed all over England, that as many young esquires as had a right to claim knighthood, should appear at Westminster on the Feast of Pentecost, and receive that honour along with the son of their sovereign, after which they should accompany him in his Scottish war. On the day appointed, three hundred young gentlemen, the flower of the Eng lish youth, with a brilliant cortege of pages and at tendants, crowded before the king's palace, which bc- 1 Rymer, Feed, new edition, vol. i. part ii. p. 982.

In this ample space the novices pitch ed their pavilions, and the king, with a splendid mu nificence, distributed to them from his royal ward robe, the scarlet cloth, fine linen, and embroidered belts, made use of on such occasions. Habited in these, they kept their vigil and watched their arms in the Chapel of the Temple, whilst the young prince performed the same ceremony in the abbey church at Westminster. On the morrow, the king with great pomp knighted his son in the palace ; and the prince, after having received the belt and spurs, came to the abbey church to confer the same upon the young esquires who were there waiting for him, with an im mense concourse of spectators. This crowd was the cause of giving additional solemnity to the spectacle, for the prince was obliged, from the press, to mount the steps of the high altar ; and on this sacred spot, amid the assembled chivalry of England, he conferred the rank of knighthood upon his three hundred com panions. The prince and his companions then pro ceeded to the banquet, at which two swans, orna mented with golden net-work, were brought in ; and, upon their being placed on the table, the king rose and made a solemn vow to God and to the Swans, that he would set out for Scotland, and there avenge the death of John Comyn, and punish the treach ery of the Scots.1 After this strange and irre- 1 Lord Hailes, vol. ii. p. 4, improves upon this vow of Edward's, by an addition which I can find neither in Math.

ROBERT BRUCE. 237 verent adjuration, he next addressed his son, and made him promise, that if he died before he took this journey, he should carry his body with the army into Scotland, and not commit it to the earth until he had obtained the victory over his enemies. After this the clergy and laity agreed to contribute a thir tieth, and the merchants a tenth, towards defraying the expenses of the war. The prince and the barons solemnly promised to perform these commands of their sovereign ; and having agreed to meet at Carlisle fif teen days after Midsummer, they returned home, to make preparations for war.' The Earl of Pembroke, with Clifford and Henry Percy, soon hastened into Scotland, and the Prince of Wales, with his knights companions, followed in the rear of their army, whilst Edward himself, unable for violent fatigue, proceeded towards Carlisle by slow journeys. It was an ill com mencement of the young prince's chivalry, that his excessive cruelty iu ravaging the country, and sparing neither age nor sex, incurred the censure of his father the king, who was himself little wont to be scrupulous on these occasions.2 Bruce was unfortunate in the early part of his ca- singham, Trivet, Hemingford, or Langtoft. He says, that the king vowed that, having performed this duty, viz. the taking vengeance on Bruce, he would not for the future unsheathe his sword against Christians, but would haste to Palestine, and wage war with the Sa racens, and never return from that holy enterprise. I am at a loss to discover the authority for this addition. 1 Math. Westmin. p. 455.

After having ravaged Galloway1 he marched towards Perth, at that time a town walled and strongly fortified, where the Earl of Pembroke lay, with a small army, composed both of Scottish and English knights. Bruce, on arriving at Perth, and finding the earl shut up within the walls, sent a challenge, requesting him, in the courteous and chivalrous style of the age, to come out and try his fortune in an open field. Pembroke answered, that the day was too far spent, but that he would fight with him on the morrow ; upon which the king retired, and encamped about a mile from Perth, in the wood of Methven. Towards evening, whilst the Scottish soldiers were busy cook ing their supper,2 and many were dispersed in fora ging parties, a cry was heard that the enemy were upon them ; and Pembroke, with his whole army, which outnumbered Bruce by fifteen hundred men, broke in upon the camp.3 The surprise was so com plete, that it can only be accounted for by the be lief, th&?vthe king had implicitly relied upon the knightly promise of the English Earl. He and his friends had scarcely time to arm themselves, and dis play their banner. They made, however, a stout re- 1 Chron. Lanercost, quoted in Tyrrel, vol. iii. p. 171. 2 Chron.

ROBERT BRUCE. 239 sistance, and at the first onset Bruce attacked the Earl of Pembroke, and slew his horse ; but no efforts of individual courage could restore order, or long de lay defeat, and the battle of Methven was from the first nearly a rout. Bruce himself was thrice un horsed, and once so nearly taken, that the captor, Sir Philip de Mowbray, called aloud that he had the new made king, when Sir Christopher Seaton felled Mow bray to the earth, and gallantly rescued his master.1 The king's brother, Edward Bruce, Bruce himself, the Earl of Athol, Sir James Douglas, Sir Gilbert de la Haye, Sir Nigel Campbell, and Sir William de Ba rondoun,2 with about five hundred men, kept the field, and at last effected their retreat into the fastnesses of Athol ; but some of his best and bravest friends fell into the hands of the enemy. Sir David de Berklay, Sir Hugh de la Haye, Sir Alexander Fraser, Sir John de Somerville, Sir David Inchmartin, and Thomas Randolph, then a young esquire, were all taken, along with Hugh, a chaplain.3 On being informed of the victory, Edward gave orders for the instant execution 1 Barbour, pp. 35, 36.

The Earl of Pembroke, with more humanity, did not carry these orders into immediate execution. Randolph, on being pardoned, deserted his uncle ; others were ransomed ; but the chaplain, with other knights who had been taken, were hanged aud quartered.1 Bruce and his friends now began to feel the mise ries of outlaws. A high price was set on his head ; he was compelled to harbour in the hills, deprived of the common comforts of life ; and hunting, in better days a free and joyous pastime, became a necessitous occupation. Want and distress at length drove him and his little band into the low country ; and at Aberdeen, his brother, Sir Nigel Bruce, met him with his queen and many other ladies, determined to share the pains of war and banishment with their hus bands and their fathers.2 Here, after enjoying a little solace and respite, a report was brought of the near advance of the English ; and the king and his friends, accompanied by their faithful women, retreated into Breadalbane.3 And now, if already they had expe rienced privation and distress, it was, we may believe, greatly aggravated by'jfche presence of those whose constitutions were little able to struggle against cold, 1 Barbour, p. 37.

The roots and berries of the earth, the venison caught in the chase, the fish which abounded in the mountain rivers, supplied them with food \u2014 the warm skins of deer and roe with bedding \u2014 and all laboured to pro mote their comfort, but none with such success as the brave and gallant Sir James Douglas. This young soldier, after the imprisonment and death of his fa ther, had been educated in all knightly qualities at the polished court of France ; x and whilst his inde fatigable perseverance in the chase afforded them in numerable comforts, his sprightly temper and constant gaiety comforted the king and amused his forlorn com panions.2 They had now reached the head of Tay, and deeper distresses seemed gathering round them, for the season was fast approaching when it was impossible for women to exist in that remote and wild region ; and they were now on the borders of the Lord of Lorn's country, a determined enemy of Bruce, who had mar ried the aunt of the murdered Comyn.3 Lorn imme diately collected a thousand men, and, with the Ba rons of Argyle, besetting the passes, hemmed in the king, and attacked him in a narrow defile, where Bruce and his small band of knights could not manage their horses. The Highlanders were on foot, and, armed 1 Hume's Hist, of House, p. 37. 2 Barbour, vol. i. p. 40. 3 Barbour, p. 41. VOL, I. Q"], [258, "1306. 242 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. with that dreadful weapon, the Lochaber axe, did great execution. Sir James Douglas, with Gilbert de la Haye, were both wounded, and many of the horses severely cut and gashed, so that the king, dreading the total destruction of his little band, ma naged to get them together, and having placed him self in the rear, between them and the men of Lorn, commenced his retreat, halting at intervals, and dri ving back the enemy, when they pressed too hard upon them. It was in one of these skirmishes that Bruce, who, in the use of his weapons, was esteemed inferior to no knight of his time, with his own hand killed three soldiers, who all attacked him at the same time, and at a disadvantage,1- \u2014 a feat, which is said to have extorted even from his enemies the praise of su perior chivalry. Having thus again escaped, a coun cil was held, and it was resolved that the queen and the ladies should be conducted to the strong castle of Kildrummie, in Marre, under an escort, commanded by young Sir Nigel Bruce, the king's brother, and John, Earl of Athol. The king, with only two hun dred men, and beset upon all sides by his enemies, was left to make his way through Lennox to Kentire, a district which, from the influence of Sir Niel Camp bell, who was then with him, he expected would be somewhat more friendly. He now gave up all the horses to those who were to escort the women, and ha- 1 Barbour, p. 44.

ROBERT BRUCE. 243 ving determined to pursue his way on foot, took a me- lancholy farewell of his queen and her ladies.1 It was the last time he ever saw his brother, who soon after was taken, and fell a victim to the implacable revenge of Edward. Bruce, meanwhile, pressed on through Perthshire to Loch Lomond. On the banks of this lake his progress was suddenly arrested. To have travelled round it, would have been accomplished at great risk, when every hour, which could convey him beyond the pursuit of his enemies, was of value. Af- ter some time, they succeeded in discovering a little boat, which, from its crazy and leaky state, could hold but three persons, and that not without great risk of sinking. In it, the king, Sir James Douglas, and another, who rowed them, first passed over. They then dispatched it in return for the rest, so that the whole band at length succeeded in reaching the other side. Amid these complicated dangers and distresses, the spirit of the king wonderfully supported his fol- lowers. His memory was stored with the tales of ro- mance, so popular in that chivalrous age, and in re- counting the sufferings of their fabled heroes, he is said to have diverted the minds of his followers from brooding too deeply on their own. They began now to feel the misery of hunger, and, in traversing the woods in search of food, they encountered the Earl of Lennox, who, since the unfortunate defeat at Methven, had heard nothing of the fate of his sovereign. Lennox fell on his master's neck, and the king embracing him, they wept together. But even this natural burst of Barbour, vol. i. p. 51."], [260, "1306. 244 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. grief proved dangerous, by occupying too much time, for the avengers of blood were in their track, and every thing depended on the king gaining the coast, where he expected to meet Sir Niel Campbell. This he fortunately accomplished ; and Campbell, with a few ships which he had collected, conveyed Bruce and his followers to the coast of Kentire, where they were hos pitably received by Angus of Isla, Lord of Kentire. From thence, deeming himself still insecure, he pass ed over to the little island of Rachrin, situated on the northern coast of Ireland, amid whose rude but friend ly inhabitants he buried himself from the pursuit of his enemies.1 Edward, on hearing of the escape of Bruce, pro ceeded with his usual severity against his enemies. He issued, from Lanercost, where he then lay on his road to Scotland, an ordinance, by which he ordered all who were guilty of the death of John Comyn to be drawn and hanged ; and decreed, that the same extremity of punishment should be inflicted on all those who either advised or assented, or who, after the fact, knowingly received them. It was added, that all who were at any time in arms against the king, either before or since the battle of Methven, as well as all who were willingly of the party of Robert Bruce, or who per suaded, and in any way assisted, the people in rising contrary to law, were, on conviction, to be imprisoned during the king's pleasure ; and it was peremptorily commanded, that the people of the country should levy hue and cry against all who had been in arms 1 Barbour, vol. i. p. 63."], [261, "1306. ROBERT BRUCE. 245 against England, and under the penalty of imprison ment, and loss of their estates and castles, apprehend every such offender dead or alive. Finally, as to the common people of Scotland, who, contrary to their in clination, might by their lords have been compelled to rise in arms, the guardian was permitted to fine and ransom them according to their offences.1 These orders were rigorously carried into execution, and the terror of the king's vengeance induced some of the Scottish barons to act with great meanness. Bruce's queen,2 and his daughter Marjory, thinking themselves insecure in the castle of Kildrummie, which was threatened by the English army, had taken re fuge in the sanctuary of St Duthac, at Tain, in Ross shire, and were treacherously given up to the English by the Earl of Ross, who violated the sanctuary, and made them, and the knights who escorted them, pri soners. The knights were immediately put to death, and the queen, with her daughter, committed to close confinement in England,3 where, in different prisons and castles, they endured an eight years' captivity. A more severe fate awaited the Countess of Buchan, who had dared to place the crown on the head of Bruce, and who was soon after taken.

No person was permitted to speak with her except the women who brought her food, and it was carefully stipulated that these should be of English extraction. Confined in this rigorous man- ner, and gazed at by all who passed by, she remained for four years shut up in her turreted cage upon the top of the walls of Berwick, till she was released from her misery, and subjected to a milder imprisonment1 in the monastery of Mount Carmel, in Berwick. Mary and Christina, both sisters to the Scottish king, were soon after made prisoners. Mary was confined in a cage similar to that of the Countess of Buchan, built for her in one of the turrets of Roxburgh castle,2 and Christina was delivered to Henry Percy, who shut her up in a convent. Immediately after the battle of Methven, the troops of the Earl of Pembroke, in scouring the country, took prisoners, Lamberton, Bishop of St Andrews, and the Abbot of Scone, who were found clad in ar mour, and conveyed them in fetters to England.3 Soon after this, Robert Wisheart, Bishop of Glasgow, who had shut himself up in the castle of Cupar in Fife, 1 Feeder, vol. iii. p. 401.

They had strenuously sup ported Bruce by their great influence, as well as by their money and their armed vassals ; and Edward, after commanding them to be imprisoned in irons within different castles, wrote to the Pope, requesting that, in consequence of their treason against him, William Comyn, brother to the Earl of Buchan, and Geoffrey de Moubray, should be appointed to the va caut sees of St Andrews and Glasgow, \u2014 a proposal with which his holiness does not appear to have com plied.2 Edward's next victim excited deeper commisera tion. Bruce's youthful brother, Nigel, had shut him self up in the castle of Kildrummie, and there defied the English army, commanded by the Earls of Lan caster and Hereford. After a brave defence, the treachery of one of the garrison, who was in the Eng lish interest, in setting fire to the magazine of corn, and destroying their supplies, compelled them to surrender.

He was sent in irons to Berwick, there condemned by a special commission, hanged, and afterwards beheaded.1 Along with him divers other knights and soldiers suffered the same fate.2 Christopher de Seton, who had married a sister of Bruce, and had rendered essential service to the king, took refuge in his own castle of Loch Urr, in Gal loway, which is said to have heen pusillanimously given up to the English by Sir Gilbert de Carrie.3 Seton, who was a great favourite with the people, was especially obnoxious to Edward, as he had been per sonally present at the death of Comyn. He was im mediately hurried in fetters to Dumfries, and condemn ed and hanged as a traitor. So dear to King Robert was the memory of this faithful friend and fellow warrior, that he afterwards erected on the spot where he was executed a little chapel, where mass was said for his soul.4 Sir Christopher's brother, John de Se ton, was taken about the same time, and put to death at Newcastle.

Edward, on hearing of his being taken, although he lay grievously sick, expressed great exul tation, and, while some interceded for Athol, on ac count of the royal blood which flowed in his veins, swore, that his only distinction should be a higher gallows than his fellow traitors. Nor was this an empty threat. He was carried to London, tried and condemned in Westminster Hall, and hanged upon a gallows fifty feet high. He was cut down half dead, his bowels were taken out and burnt before his face, and at last he was beheaded, his head being after wards placed, amongst those of other Scottish pa triots, upon London bridge.1 Sir Simon Fraser was still free ; and the other Scottish knights and nobles who had fallen into the hands of Edward, are said to have boasted, that it would require all the efforts of the king to apprehend him. Fraser was a veteran soldier ; his life had been spent in war both at home and on the continent, and he enjoyed a very high reputation. With a small force which he had collected, he made a last effort for the national liberty at Kirkencliff, near Stirling, but was entirely routed, and forced to surrender him- self prisoner to Sir Thomas de Multon. Many knights and squires were taken along with him, whilst others fell on the field, or were drowned in the river.2 This 1 Math.

He was carried to London heavily ironed, with his legs tied under his horse's belly, and, as he passed through the city, a garland of periwinkle was in mockery placed upon his head. He was then lodged in the Tower, along with his squire, Thomas de Boys, and Sir Herbert de Mor ham, a Scottish knight of French extraction, whose courage and manly deportment are commemorated in a contemporary English ballad. Fraser was tried and condemned, after which he suffered the death of a traitor, with all its circumstances of refined cruelty. He was hanged, cut down when still living, and be headed ; his bowels were then torn out and burnt, and his head fixed beside that of Wallace upon London bridge.1 The trunk was hung in chains, and strictly guarded, lest his friends should remove it.

After the disgusting details of these executions, the reader will be disposed to smile at the remark of a late acute historian, that the execution of the Scottish prisoners is insufficient to load Edward's memory with the charge of cruelty.1 To complete the ruin of Bruce, it only remained to dispose of his great estates, and to excommunicate him, as guilty of murder and sa crilege. His lordship of Annandale was bestowed on the Earl of Hereford, his maternal estate of Carrie given to Henry Percy, and the Lord Robert Clif ford, with others of Edward's nobles, shared the rich English estates, which had long been hereditary in this powerful family.2 In the end of February, the Cardinal St Sabinus, the legate of the Pope in England, with great pomp repaired to Carlisle, in which city Edward then kept his head-quarters, and with all those circumstances of terror which such a sentence involved, Robert Bruce and his adherents were excommunicated by book, bell, and candle.3 under William the Lyon, to a family named Malherbe, who after wards assumed the name of Morham.

On the approach of spring, having re ceived some assistance from Christina of the Isles, he began to meditate a descent upon Scotland, and first dispatched Sir James Douglas and Sir Robert Boid on au adventure to the island of Arran. Douglas found the island occupied by Sir John Hastings, an English knight, who held the castle of Brodick with a strong garrison ; and having laid an ambuscade, he had the good fortune to surprise the under-warden of the castle, and, after killing forty of his soldiers, to make himself master of a valuable cargo of provisions, arms, and clothing. This proved a very seasonable supply to the king, who soon after arrived from Rach rin with a small fleet of thirty-three galleys, and in his company about three hundred men. Ignorant of the situation of the enemy, Bruce first dispatched a trusty messenger from Arran into his own country of Carrie, with instructions, if he found the people well affected, to light a fire, at a day appointed, upon an eminence near Turnberry castle. When the day ar rived, Bruce, who watched in extreme anxiety for the signal, about noon perceived a light in the ex pected direction, and instantly embarked, steering, as night came on, by the light of the friendly bea con.1 Meanwhile, his messenger had also seen the fire, and dreading that Bruce might embark, has- 1 Barbour, vol. i. p. 83."], [269, "1306.

This Edward said in the true spirit of a knight errant ; but Bruce, who was playing a game of which the stake was a kingdom, might be allowed to hesi tate. His naturally fearless and sanguine temper, however, got the better, and, dismissing caution, he determined to remain, and, as it was still night, to attack the English quarters. The plan succeeded. The enemy, cantoned in careless security, were easily surprised and put to the sword ; while Percy, hearing the tumult, but ignorant of the small number of the Scotch, did not dare to attempt a rescue, but left a rich booty to Bruce, amongst which were his war horses and his household plate.1 There was a romantic interest about Bruce's fate and fortunes, which had a powerful effect upon the female mind, and the hero himself seems to have been willing to avail himself of this influence.2 He had 1 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 225. - Barbour, vol. i. p. 105, line 54L"], [270, "1306. 254 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. already received assistance from the Countess of Buch an and Christina of the Isles, and now, on hearing of his success in Carrie, he was joined by a lady, nearly related to him, but whose name has been lost. She brought him, however, a seasonable supply of money and provisions, and a reinforcement of forty men. From her, too, he first learnt the miserable fate of Seton, Athol, and the garrison of Kildrum mie ; and, during the recital, is said to have vowed deeply that their deaths should not go unrevenged. Bruce's success seems to have spread a panic among the English ; for although Ayr castle was in the hands of Edward, neither its garrison, nor that of Turnberry, under Percy, dared to make head against him. At length, Sir Roger St John marched from Northumberland with a body of a thousand men ; co vered by this force, Henry Percy, with the remains of his garrison, evacuated Turnberry, and hurried into England ; 1 whilst Bruce, unable to oppose St John, retired into the mountainous parts of Carrie. Here the adventurous spirit of James Douglas could not long remain inactive. He knew that Lord Clifford, on whom Edward had bestowed his ancient heredi tary domain, held his own castle of Douglas with a strong garrison ; and having obtained the king's per mission, he travelled in disguise into Douglasdale, and, after carefully observing the strength and posi tion of the enemy, cautiously discovered himself to 1 Barbour, vol. i. p. 95. Trivet, p. 344."], [271, "1306. ROBERT BRUCE. 255 his vassals. These, rejoiced to find the son of their old lord amongst them, flocked round him under cover of night, and thus, unknown to the English, a little band of determined foes was nursed amongst them, who watched every step they took, and were ready to pounce upon them the very first moment of careless security. This soon presented itself. The garrison, on Palm Sunday, marched out to the neigh bouring church of St Bride, leaving the castle unde fended. Some of Douglas's followers, with concealed arms, entered the church along with them, and in a moment when they least suspected, the English heard the cry of \" Douglas !\" and found themselves attack ed both from without and within. After a stout re sistance, and much bloodshed, the church was won and many prisoners taken. Having thus cut off the garrison, Douglas first plundered the castle of the arms aud valuables which could be carried off. This done, he raised a huge pile of the malt and corn which he found in the stores, staved the casks of wine and other liquors, and threw them on the heap, after which he slew his prisoners, and cast their dead bodies on the pile. He then set fire to this savage hecatomb, and consumed it and the halls of his fathers iu the blaze.1 This cruel transaction, which is said to have 1 Hume's House of Douglas and Angus, vol. i. pp. 50, 51.

This success, however, was more than balanced by a grievous disaster which about this time befell Bruce. He had dispatched his brothers, Thomas and Alex ander, into Ireland, where they had the good fortune to collect a force of seven hundred men, with which they crossed over to Loch Ryan in Galloway. But their approach to the coast had been watched by Macdonall, a chieftain of that country, who was in the English interest, and as they attempted to make good a landing, he attacked, and completely routed their little army. Many perished in the sea, and the rest were either slain or taken prisoners. Of the prisoners, those of note were Bruce's brothers, Thomas and Alexander, with Sir Reginald Crawford, who were all grievously wounded. Malcolm Mackail, Lord of Ken tire, along with two Irish reguli or chiefs, were found amongst the slain. Macdonall with savage exulta tion cut off their heads, and presented them, and his illustrious prisoners, bleeding and almost dead, to the King at Carlisle.1 Edward commanded the twoBruces and Crawford to be instantly executed. Thus, within 1 Math. Westminster, p. 457. Hemingford, p. 225. Langtoft, with less probability, asserts, that Macdonall surprised the two Braces and their soldiers, on Ash Wednesday, when returning from church, vol. ii. p. 337. The Macdonalls were anciently the most powerful family in Galloway.

ROBERT BRUCE. 257 a few short months had Bruce to lament the cruel death of three brothers, that of his dear friends, Seton, Athol, and Fraser ; besides the imprisonment of his queen and his daughters. Deprived of this reinforcement, the king began to be in great difficulties. The English hotly pursued him, and even had the meanness to lay plots for his assassi nation, whilst the men of Galloway endeavoured to hunt him down with bloodhounds.1 Partly by his own valour, and partly from the private information which he received from those kindly disposed to him, the king escaped these toils ; and as he still counted amongst his party some of the bravest and most ad venturous soldiers in Scotland, it often happened, that when his fortunes seemed sinking to the lowest ebb, some auspicious adventure occurred, which re-anima ted the hopes of the party, and encouraged them to persevere. The castle of Douglas had been rebuilt by the English. It was again attacked by its terrible master, the \" Good Sir James ;\" aud although he failed in getting it into his hands, its captain was slain, and a great part of its garrison put to the sword ;2 after which, having heard that the Earl of Pembroke, with a large force, was marching against the king, who still lay in the mountainous parts of Carrie, Douglas j oined his sovereign, and awaited their advance Bruce had now been well trained, and his soldiers fa miliarly acquainted with this partizan kind of warfare ; and it was his custom, when keenly pursued, to make - Barbour, vol. i. pp. 108, 111, 122. 1 Barbour, p. 122. VOL. I. K"], [274, "1307- 258 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. his soldiers disperse in small companies, first appoint ing a place of rendezvous, where they should re-assem ble when the danger was over. Trusting to this plan, and to his own personal courage and skill, he did not hesitate with only four hundred men to await the at tack of Pembroke's army, which had been reinforced by John of Lorn with eight hundred Highlanders, fa miliar with war in a mountainous country, and well calculated to pursue Bruce into the moors and morasses which had so often protected him from his enemies. Lorn is, moreover, reported to have taken along with him a large bloodhound, which had once belonged to the king, and whose instinctive attachment was thus meanly employed against its old master. The High land chief contrived so successfully to conceal his men, that Bruce, whose attention was fixed chiefly on Pem broke's force, found his position unexpectedly attacked by Lorn in the rear, and by the English, with whom was his own nephew Randolph, in the front. His brother Edward Bruce, and Sir James Douglas, were now with him ; and after making head for a short time, they divided their little force into three companies, and dispersed amongst the mountains. Bruce trusted that he might thus have a fairer chance of escape; but the bloodhound instantly fell upon the track of the king, and the treacherous Lorn with his mountaineers had almost run him down, when the animal was transfixed by an arrow from one of the fugitives, and Bruce with great difficulty escaped.1 In this pursuit, it is said, 1 Barbour, vol. i. p. 131."], [275, "1307. 259 ROBERT BRUCE. that with his own hand he slew five of the enemy ; which, as the men of Lorn were probably half-naked and ill-armed savages, who had to measure weapons with a knight in complete steel and of uncommon per sonal strength, is in no respect unlikely to be true. Bruce, however, it is said, had the misfortune to lose his banner, which was taken by Randolph, then fight ing in the ranks of the English. It was an age this of chivalrous adventure ; the circumstances in which the king was placed when related even in the simplest manner, partake strongly of a deep and romantic in terest, and renouncing everything in the narrative of his almost contemporary biographer, which looks like poetical embellishment, the historian must be careful to omit no event which is consistent with the testi mony of authentic writers, with the acknowledged personal prowess of the king, and the character of the times in which he lived. Not long after this adventure, Bruce attacked and put to the sword a party of two hundred English sol diers, carelessly cantoned at a small distance from the main army; and the Earl of Pembroke, after an unsuc cessful skirmish in Glentruel, where the wooded and marshy nature of the country incapacitated his cavalry from acting with effect, became disgusted with his ill success, and retreated to Carlisle. The king instantly came down upon the plains of Ayrshire \u2014 made himself master of the strengths of the country, \u2014 and reduced the whole of Kyle, Carrie, and Cunningham, to his obedience; while Sir James Douglas, ever on the alert, attacked and discomfited Sir Philip Mowbray, who,"], [276, "260 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1307. with a thousand men, was marching from Bothwell into Kyle, and with difficulty escaped to the castle of Innerkip, then held by an English garrison. By these fortunate events, the followers of Bruce were in spired with that happy confidence in his skill and courage, which, even in the very different warfare of our own days, is one principal cause of success ; and he soon found his little army reinforced by such numbers, that he determined, on the first opportu nity, to try his strength against the English in an open field. Nor was this opportunity long of pre senting itself. The Earl of Pembroke, in the be ginning of May, and soon after the defeat of Mow bray, advanced, with a body of heavy-armed horse, into Ayrshire, and came up with Bruce at Loudon Hill. It is said, that in the spirit of the times, Pembroke challenged the Scottish king to give him battle ; and that, having sent word that he intended to march by Loudon Hill, Bruce, who was then with his little army at Galston, conceiving the ground to be as favourable as could be chosen, agreed to meet him at Loudon Hill, on the 10th of May.1 The road, at that part of Loudon Hill where Robert de termined to wait the advance of the English, led through a piece of dry level ground about five hun dred yards in breadth, and which was bounded on both sides by extensive and deep morasses; but, deem- 1 Barbour, vol. i. p. 153.

A rabble of un armed countrymen and camp-followers were station ed, with his baggage, in the rear.1 Early in the morning, the king, who was on the look-out, descried the advance of Pembroke, whose force he knew amounted to three thousand cavalry. Their appear ance, with the sun gleaming upon the coat and horse armour of the knights, and the pennons and banners, of various colours, waving above the wood of spears, was splendid and imposing, contrasted with Bruce's small battalion.2 Yet, confident in the strength of his position, he calmly awaited their attack. The result entirely justified his expectations \u2014 and proved how dreadful a weapon the long Scottish spear might be made, when skilfully directed and used against cavalry. Pembroke had divided his force into two lines ; and, by his orders, the first line put their spears in rest, and charged the battalion of the Scotch at full gallop. But they made no impression. The Scottish soldiers stood perfectly firm \u2014 many of the English were unhorsed 1 The account of this battle is taken entirely from Barbour, vol. i. p. 155. The English historians all allow that Pembroke was beaten, but give no particulars. 2 Barbour, vol. i. p. 157."], [278, "1307- 262 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. and slain\u2014 and, in a very short time, the first division, thrown into disorder, fell back upon the second, which in its turn, as the Scots steadily advanced with their extended spears, began to waver, to break, aud at last to fly. Bruce was not slow to follow up his advan tage, and completely dispersed the enemy, but with out much slaughter or many prisoners, the Scots ha ving no force in cavalry. The victory, however, had the best effect. Pembroke retired to the castle of Ayr. Bruce's army acquired additional confidence, its ranks were every day recruited ; and, awaking from their foolish dreams of confidence and superiori ty, the English began to feel and to dread the great military talents which the king had acquired during the constant perils to which he had been exposed. Only three days after the dispersion of Pembroke's army, he attacked, and with great slaughter defeated Ralph Monthermer, Earl of Gloucester, another of Edward's captains, whom he so hotly pursued, that he compelled him to shut himself up, along with Pembroke, in the castle of Ayr, to which he imme diately laid siege.1 These repeated successes of Bruce greatly incensed Edward ; and, although debilitated by illness, he summoned his whole military vassals to meet him at Carlisle, three weeks after the feast of John the Baptist, and determined to march in person against his enemies. Persuading himself, that the virulence of the disease, under which he laboured, was 1 Leland, Collect., vol. ii. p. 543. Math. Westminster, p. 458 Trivet, p. 346.

But his strength soon failed him ; in four days he proceeded only six miles ; and, after reach ing the small village of Burgh-upon-Sands, he expired on the 7th of July 1307,1 leaving the mighty projects of his ambition, and the uneasy task of opposing Bruce, to a successor whose character was in every way the opposite of his father's. The last request of the dying monarch was, that his heart should be cou veyed to Jerusalem, and that his body, after having been reduced to a skeleton, by a process, which, if we may credit Froissart, the king himself described,2 should be carried along with the army into Scotland, and remain unburied till that devoted country was entirely subdued. Edward the Second, who succeeded to the crown of England in his twenty-fourth year, was little cal culated to carry into effect the mighty designs of his predecessor. His character was weak, irresolute, and head-strong; and the first steps which he took, as king, evinced a total want of respect for the dying 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, p. 1018, vol. i. part ii. new edit.

He committed his body to the royal sepulchre at Westminster, \u2014 he recalled from banishment Piers Gaveston, his profligate fa vourite ; and, after receiving at Roxburgh the homage of some of the Scottish barons in the interest of Eng land, he pushed forward as far as Cumnock, on the borders of Ayrshire \u2014 appointed the Earl of Pem broke guardian of Scotland \u2014 and, without striking a blow, speedily retreated into his own dominions.1 Upon the retreat of the English, the king, and his brother, Sir Edward Bruce, at the head of a powerful army, broke in upon Galloway, and commanded the inhabitants to rise and join his banner. Where this order was disobeyed, the lands were given up to mili tary execution ; and Bruce, who had not forgotten the defeat and death of his two brothers by the men of this wild district, laid waste the country with fire and sword, and permitted every species of plunder,2 in a spirit of natural and almost justifiable retaliation. 1 Hemingford, p. 238, vol. i.

This news was the more unwelcome, as a grievous distemper began at this time to prey upon the king, depriving him of his strength and appetite, and for a time lea ving little hopes of his recovery. As the soldiers of Bruce were greatly dispirited at the sickness of the king, Edward, his brother, deemed it prudent to avoid a battle, and entrenched himself in a strong position near Slaines, on the north coast of Aberdeenshire. After some slight skirmishes between the archers of both armies, which ended in nothing decisive, pro visions began to fail, and as the troops of Buchan daily increased, the Scots retired in good order to Strabogy, carrying their king, who was still too weak to mount his horse, in a litter.2 From this last station, as Bruce began slowly to recover his strength, the Scots re- expedition into the north, not as the consequence of any defeat, but as the result of a plan for the reduction of the northern parts of Scotland. 1 Barbour, p. 162. -- ibid. pp. 170, 171,"], [283, "1307.

His friends remonstrated, but the king mounted on horseback, and although so weak as to be supported by two men on each side, he led on his soldiers in person, and instantly attacking thc Earl of Buchan with great fury,2 entirely routed and dispersed his army, pursuing them as far as Fivy, on the borders of Buchan. Into this country, the terri tory of his mortal enemy, he now marched, and took ample revenge for all the injuries he had sustained, wasting it with fire, and delivering it over to unbri dled military execution.

His nephew, Sir David de Brechin, a baron of great power and following, who had hitherto acted with Edward, joined him about this time, and pursuing his advantage, he laid si'ege to the castle of Aberdeen.1 Edward was now at Windsor, and, alarmed at the progress of Bruce, he dispatched an expedition to raise the siege of Aberdeen, and commanded the different sea-ports to fit out a fleet which should co-ope rate with his land-forces. But these preparations were too late, for the citizens of Aberdeen, who had early distinguished themselves in the war of liberty, and were warmly attached to the cause of Bruce, encou raged by the presence of his army, and assisted by some of his most faithful partizans, assaulted and carried the castle by storm, expelled the English, and levelled the fortifications with the ground.1 From Aberdeen the king held his victorious pro gress into Angus, and here new success awaited him, in the capture of the castle of Forfar, at this time strongly garrisoned by the English. It was taken by escalade during the night-time, by a soldier named Philip the Forester of Platane, who put all the Eng lish to the sword ; and the king, according to his usual policy, instantly commanded the fortifications to be destroyed.2 The vicinity of Bruce's army now threat- 1 The battle of Inverury was fought on the 22d May 1308, and Edward's letter for the relief of Aberdeen, is dated the 10th July 1308.

Umfra ville and St John, assisted by Donegal, or Dongal,2 probably the same powerful chieftain, who, in a for mer year, had defeated Bruce's brothers, collected a force of twelve hundred men, and encountered Ed ward Bruce at the water of Crie.

The kingdom of Galloway contained Ananderdale and Car rie, and hence these proud Galwegian princes considered the Braces from the first as strangers and intruders, who had wrested from them part of their hereditary dominions.

Upon his near approach, Bruce dis covered, by his scouts, that it was the design of the English to make a forced march, and attack him by surprise. The courage of this brave soldier, bordering upon temerity, now impelled him to an attempt, which more cool and politic valour would have pronounced desperate. He stationed his foot soldiers in a strait valley, strongly fortified by nature,2 and, early in the morning, under the cover of a thick mist, with fifty horsemen, well armed and mounted, he made a retro grade movement, and gained the rear of the English, without being perceived by them. Following their line of march about a bow-shot off, his intention seems to have been to have allowed St John to attack his infantry, and then to have charged them in the rear ; but before this could be effected, the mist suddenly 1 Ker's Bruce, vol. i. p. 345. \" His small folk gait he ilk deil, Withdraw thaim till a strait tharby, And he raid furth with his fifty.\" \u2014 Barbour, p. 183. \" Withdraw tham till a strait tharby.\" Lord Hailes, by this ex pression, concludes that Bruce made his infantry cast up entrench ments ; and Ker, p. 346.

In this desperate situa tion, Edward hesitated not to charge the English, which he did with so much fury, that their ranks were shaken, and many of their cavalry unhorsed. Before they could recover so far as to discern the in significant numbers of their enemy, he made a se cond, and soon after a third charge, so sharp and well sustained, that the confusion became general and ir retrievable ; and believing, probably, that the Scottish troop was only the advance of a greater force, the English broke away in a panic, and were entirely routed. Sir Alan de Cathcart, one of Edward Bruce's companions in this spirited enterprise, recounted the particulars to Barbour, the affectionate biographer of Bruce, who characterises it in simple but energetic language as a right fair point of chivalry.1 This, however, was not the only triumph. Donald of the Isles collected a large force of his Galwegian infantry, and, assisted by Sir Roland of Galway,2 and other fierce chiefs of that district, made head against the royalists. Edward Bruce, flushed with his recent vic tories, encountered them on the banks of the Dee, dispersed their army, with the slaughter of Roland, 1 Barbour, p. 185. 2 \" Quendam militem nomine Rolandum.\" In Rymer, vol. i. new edition, part ii. p. 772, we find mention made of Rolandus Gal watensis Dominus ; and in Dugdale's Monasticon, vol. ii. p. 1057 Roland Macdonall, in 1190, is styled \" Princeps Gallovidi\u00e6.\" This Roland may have been the grandson of Roland, Prince of Gallo way. l"], [289, "1308.

During these repeated successes of his brother, Bruce received intelligence, that his indefatigable par tizan, Sir James Douglas, having cut off the garrison of Douglas Castle, which he had decoyed into an am buscade, had slain the governor, Sir John de Webe ton, compelled the castle to surrender, and entirely destroyed the fortifications.2 Douglas soon after re duced to obedience the forests of Selkirk and Jed burgh, and, during his warfare in those parts, had the good fortune to surprise and take prisoners, Thomas Randolph, the king's nephew, and Alexander Stewart of Bonkill, both of whom were still attached to the English interest.3 Douglas, to whom Stewart was nearly related, treated his noble prisoners with great kindness, and soon after conducted Randolph to the king. \" Nephew,\" said Bruce, \" you have for a while forgotten your allegiance, but now you must be recon ciled.\" \u2014 \" I,\" answered Randolph, fiercely, \" have done nothing which ought to subject me to blame.

Since you defied the King of England to war, you ought to have defended your title in the open field, and not be taken yourself to cowardly ambuscades.\" The king calmly replied, \" That may be hereafter, and per chance ere long. Meanwhile, it is fitting that your proud words receive due chastisement, and that you be taught to know my right and your own duty.\" Having thus spoken, Bruce ordered Randolph into close con finement.1 This proud chief, after a short imprison ment, joined the party of the king, who created him Earl of Moray. Nor had Bruce any reason to repent of his forgiveness or his generosity. Randolph soon displayed very high talents for war ; he became one of the most illustrious of Bruce's coadjutors in the li beration of his country, and ever after served his royal master with unshaken fidelity. The king had not forgotten the attack made upou him by the Lord of Lorn, soon after the defeat at Methven, and he was now able to requite that fierce chief for the extremities to which he had then redu ced him. Accordingly, after the junction of Dou glas with his veteran soldiers, he invaded the territory of Lorn, and arrived at a narrow and dangerous pass, which runs along the bottom of Cruachin Ben, a high and rugged mountain, between Loch Awe and Loch Etive. The common people of Scotland were now, without much exception, on the side of Bruce ; aud although, in many districts, when kept down by their 1 Hailes' Annals, vol. ii. 4to edition, p. 26."], [291, "1308. 275 ROBERT BRUCE. lords, they dared not join him openly, yet in convey ing intelligence of the motions and intentions of his enemies, they were of essential service to the cause. In this manner he seems to have been informed, that an ambuscade had been laid for him, by the men of Lorn, in the pass of Cruachin Ben, through which he intended to march. The Lord of Lorn himself lay, with his galleys, in Loch Etive, and waited the re sult. The nature of the ground was highly favour able for this design of Lorn ; but it was entirely de feated by the dispositions of Bruce. Having divided his army into two parts, he ordered Douglas, along with one division, consisting entirely of archers, who were lightly armed, to make a circuit round the moun tain, and to take possession of the rugged high ground above the Highlanders. Along with Douglas, were Sir Andrew Gray, Sir Alexander Fraser, and Sir William Wiseman. This man\u0153uvre was executed with complete success ; and Bruce, having entered the pass, was, in its narrow gorge, immediately attacked by the men of Lorn, who, with loud shouts, hurled down stones upon him, and after discharging their missiles, rushed on to a nearer attack. But the king, whose soldiers were light-armed, and prepared for what occurred, met his enemies more than half-way ; and not content with receiving their charge, assaulted them with great fury. Meanwhile Douglas had gained the high ground, and letting fly a shower of arrows, attacked the Highlanders in the rear, and threw them into complete disorder. After a stout resistance, the men of Lorn were defeated with great"], [292, "1308. 276 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. slaughter ; and their chief, the Lord of Lorn, had the mortification, from his galleys, to be an eye-wit ness of the utter rout of his army.1 He immediately fled to his castle of Dunstaff nage; and Bruce, after having ravaged the territory of Lorn, and delivered it to indiscriminate plunder, laid close siege to this palace of the Island Prince, which was strongly situated upon the sea coast. In a short time the Lord of Lorn surrendered his castle, and swore homage to the king ; but his son, John of Lorn, fled to his ships, and continued in the service of Eng land.2 Whilst everything went thus successfully with Bruce in the field, he derived great advantage from the fluctuating and capricious line of policy which was pursued by his opponent. In less than a year Edward appointed six different governors in Scot land ; 3 and to none of these persons, however high their talents, was there afforded sufficient time to or ganize, or carry into effect, any regular plan of mili tary operations. About this time Bruce laid siege to the castle of Rutherglen, in Clydesdale \u2014 a strength 1 Barbour, pp. 191, 192. 23d August 1308. 2 Barbour, p. 192. Fordun a Hearne, p. 1005.

Alarmed at last by the near approach of Bruce and his army to the English border, he consented to accept the mediation of Philip, King of France, who, with the consent of Edward, dispatched Oli ver de Roches to treat with Bruce, and Lamber ton, Bishop of St Andrews, upon measures prepa ratory to a reconciliation. This able and intrigu ing prelate, on renewing his homage to the English King, had been liberated from his imprisonment, and permitted to return to Scotland ; but his fellow pri soner, Wisheart, the Bishop of Glasgow, considered too dangerous a person, and too devoted to his coun try, was still kept in close confinement. Des Roches' negotiation was soon followed by the' arrival of the king's brother, Lewis, Count of Evreux, and Guy, Bishop of Soissons, as ambassadors, earnestly persua- 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, p. 60, m. 12.

The Sieur de Varrennes, Philip's ambassador at the Eng lish court, openly sent a letter to Bruce under the title of the Earl of Carrie, but he intrusted to the same bearer secret dispatches, which were addressed to the King of Scots. Edward dissembled his indig nation, and weakly contented himself with a complaint against the duplicity of the ambassador.2 Nearly a whole year after this appears to have been spent in a vacillating and contradictory policy with regard to Scotland, which was calculated to give every advantage to. so able a monarch as Bruce.

To this everything in Scotland offered a most striking contrast. In the beginning of the year 1309, the estates held a solemn assembly at Dundee, and declared, that Robert, Lord of Annan dale, the competitor, ought, by the ancient laws and customs of that country, to have been preferred to Baliol in the competition for the crown ; and that, for this reason, they unanimously recognised Robert Bruce, then reigning, as their lawful sovereign ; and they engaged to defend his right, and the liberties and independence of Scotland, against all opponents, and declared all who should contravene the same to be guil ty of treason against the king, and to be held as traitors against the nation.2 At the same time, the repre sentatives of the clergy, the bishops, abbots, and priors, issued to the nation a pastoral manifesto, confirm ing the determination of the estates of the kingdom, declaring, that all deeds of a contrary tenor had been extorted by violence, and that they, of their own free will, acknowledged and did homage to him as their lawful sovereign. The spirit of the king had in fused itself into the nobility, and pervaded the low est ranks of the people \u2014 that feeling of superiority, which a great military commander invariably com- 1 Hemingford, p. 246, vol. i.

It had been strongly fortified at a great expense by the English, and was intrusted to John Fitz-Marmaduke and a powerful garrison. Edward was at last roused into personal activity. He ordered a fleet to sail to the Tay \u2014 he issued writs for levies of troops for its instant relief2 \u2014 and he commanded his whole mili tary vassals to rendezvous at Berwick on the 8th of September, to proceed immediately against his ene mies. Disgusted with the presence of his favourite Gaveston, many of the great barons refused to repair in person to the royal standard ; yet a powerful army assembled, and the Earls of Gloucester and Warrene, Lord Henry Percy, Lord James Clifford, and many other nobles and barons, were in the field.3 With this great force Edward in the end of autumn inva ded Scotland ; and Bruce, profiting by the lessons of former years, and recollecting the disastrous defeats 1 Hemingford, ut supra.

It hap pened that Scotland was this year visited by a famine uuprecedentedly severe, and the king, after driving away the herds and flocks into the narrow straits and valleys, retired on the approach of the English to the woods, and waited, with the patient experience of a veteran, for the distress which the scarcity of fo rage and provisions must necessarily occasion. The English king marched on from Roxburgh, through the forest of Selkirk and Jedburgh, to Biggar, look ing in vain for an enemy to conquer. From this he penetrated to Renfrew,1 and, with a weak and injudi cious vengeance, burnt and laid waste the country, so that the heavy-armed cavalry, which formed the strength of his army, soon began to be in grievous distress ; and, without a single occurrence of moment, he was compelled to order a retreat, and return to Berwick, where he spent the winter. Upon the re treat of the English, Bruce and his soldiers, leaving their fastnesses, broke down upon Lothian ; 2 and Ed ward, hearing of the reappearance of his enemies, with a great part of his forces again entered Scotland ; but this second expedition concluded in the same unsa tisfactory manner ; and a third army, equally formi dable in its numbers and equipment, which was in trusted to his favourite, the Earl of Cornwall, pene trated across the firth of Forth, advanced to Perth, 1 Ker is in an error in asserting that there is no evidence of Edward's having penetrated to Renfrew.

Not satisfied with this, and aware that the English king was exclusively engaged in contentions with his barons, Bruce and his army, in the beginning of September, again entered England by the district of Redesdale, carried fire and sword through that country as far as Corbrigg, then broke with the fierceness and rapacity of wolves1 into Tine dale, ravaged the Bishopric of Durham, and, after levying contributions for fifteen days, and enriching themselves with spoils and captives, marched back without opposition into Scotland.2 The miseries suf fered from these invasions, and the defenceless state of the frontier, induced the people of Northumberland and the lord marchers to purchase a short truce from the Scottish king, a circumstance strongly indicative of the increasing imbecility of the English govern ment.3 On his return, Bruce determined to besiege Perth, and sat down before it ; but owing to the strength of the fortifications, it defied for six weeks all the efforts of his army. It had been intrusted to the command of William Oliphant, an Anglecised Scot, to whom Edward, in alarm for so important a post, had pro mised to send succours before the Feast of all Saints ;4 1 It is Edward's own comparison in his epistle to the Pope.

The care of Edward the First had made Perth a place of great strength. It was fortified by a strong and high wall, defended at intervals by lofty stone towers, aud surrounded by a broad, deep moat, full of water. Bruce, having carefully observed the place where the fosse was shallowest, provided scaling lad ders, struck his tents, and raised the siege. He then marched to a considerable distance, and having lulled the garrison into security by an absence of eight days, he suddenly returned during the night, and reach ed the walls undiscovered by the enemy. The king in person led his soldiers across the ditch, bearing a ladder in his hand, and armed at all points. The water reached his throat, but he felt his way with his spear, waded through in safety, and was the se cond person who fixed his ladder and mounted the wall. A little incident, related by Barbour, evinces, in a striking manner, the spirit which the exam ple of the king communicated to his companions. A French knight was present in the Scottish army, and observing the intrepidity with which Bruce led his soldiers, he exclaimed, \" What shall we say of our French lords, who live at ease, in the midst of feast ing, wassail, and jollity, when so brave a knight is here putting his life in hazard to win a miserable hamlet.\" l So saying, he threw himself into the water 1 Barbour, vol. i. p. 177."], [301, "1312. 285 ROBERT BRUCE. with the gay valour of his nation, and having passed the ditch, scaled the walls along with the king and his soldiers. So complete was the surprise, that the town was almost instantly taken. Every Scotsman who had joined the English interest was put to the sword, but the English garrison were all spared,1 and the king contented himself with the plunder of the town, and the total demolition of its fortifications. In the midst of these continued and brilliant suc cesses of Bruce, the measures of the English king offered a woful contrast to the energetic administra tion of his father. They were entirely on the defen sive. He gave orders, indeed, for the assembling of an army, and made promises and preparations for an invasion of Scotland. But the orders were recalled, and Edward, engrossed with the disputes with his barons, took no decided part against the enemy. He wrote, however, to the different English governors of the few remaining castles in Scotland, who had repre sented in piteous terms their incapacity of standing out against the attacks of the Scots, without a rein forcement of men, money, and provisions ;2 he direct ed flattering letters to John of Argyle, the islaud prince, praising him for the annoyance which his fleet had occasioned to Bruce, and exhorting him to con tinue his services during the winter ; and he entreated the pope to retain Wisheart, Bishop of Glasgow, as a 1 Chron.

These feeble efforts were followed up by a pusillani mous attempt to conclude a truce ; hut the King of Scotland, eager to pursue his career of success, re fused to accede2 to the proposal, and a third time in vaded England with a greater force, and a more de solating fury than before. The towns of Hexham and Corbridge were burned down-; his army then, by a forced march, surprised the rich and opulent city of Durham during the night,3 slew all who resisted him, and reduced a great part of it to ashes. The castle and the precincts of its noble abbey withstood the ef forts of the Scots, but the rest of the city was en tirely sacked ; and so rich was the spoil, that the inha bitants of the Bishopric, dreading the repetition of such a visit, offered two thousand pounds to purchase a truce. The terms upon which Robert agreed to this, evince the amazing change which had taken place in the relative position of the two countries.

The hooks of the rope ladders were already fixed on the wall, and the soldiers had begun silently to mount, when the barking of a dog alarmed the garrison, and the assailants were compel led to retire with loss.4 1 Chron.

On his return to Scotland, King Robert was repaid for this partial discomfiture, by the recovery of many important strengths. Dalswynton castle, in Gallo way, the chief residence of his enemies the Comyns, and soon after the castles of Butel and of Dumfries, which last had been committed to the care of Henry de Beaumont, were taken by assault, and, according to the constant practice of Bruce, immediately razed, and rendered untenable by any military force.1 Ed ward now trembled for his strong castle of Karlave rock, which had cost his father so long and perilous a siege ; and he wrote with great anxiety to its con stable, Eustace de Maxwell, exhorting him to adopt every means in his power for its defence. In the winter of the same year, this weak monarch was guilty of conduct which was truly contemptible. The English garrison of Dundee had been so hard pressed by the Scots, that William de Montfichet, the war den, entered into a treaty to surrender the place, and give up a number of Scottish prisoners within a sti pulated time.

Montfichet was, moreover, enjoined to warn the Scots, that if any of the English prisoners, or hostages, in their hands, should be put to death, orders would be given for the immediate execution of all the Scottish prisoners in the hands of the English. In addition to this, the king addressed flattering let ters to the several officers of the garrison of Dundee, and even to the mayor, bailiffs, and community, thank ing them for their good offices, and exhorting them to persevere in the defence of the town. David de Bre chin, the nephew of Bruce, yet an anglicized Scot, was commanded to co-operate, as joint-warden with Montfichet, and earnest orders were dispatched for reinforcements of ships, provisions, and soldiers, to be sent from Newcastle and Berwick.1 The heroic spirit of Bruce had now transfused itself into the peasantry of the country ; and the king began to reap the fruits of this popular spirit, in the capture of the Peel, or castle of Linlithgow, by a common countryman named Binny. Binny, who was known to the garrison, and had been employed in leading hay into the fort, communicated his design to a party of Scottish soldiers, whom he stationed in ambush near the gate. In his large wain he contrived to con ceal eight armed men, covered with a load of hay, a servant drove the oxen, and Binny himself walked carelessly at his side. When the drawbridge was rai sed, aud the wain stood in the middle of the gateway, so that it was impossible to let down the portcullis, 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, 5 Ed.

Bruce amply rewarded the brave countryman, and ordered the castle and its strong outworks, con structed by Edward I., to be immediately demolish ed.1 Edward had committed the charge of the castle of Roxburgh, a post of the utmost importance, to a Bur gundian knight, Gillemin de Fiennes. On Fasten's Even, immediately before Lent, when the soldiers and officers of the garrison were indulging in wine and wassail, Sir James Douglas, with about sixty sol diers, favoured by a dark night, and concealed by black frocks thrown over their armour, cautiously approach ed the castle, and succeeded in reaching the foot of the walls, and fixing their ladders of rope, without being discovered. They could not, however, mount so quiet ly, but that the nearest sentinel on the outer wall per ceived the noise, and ran to meet them.

Another sentinel was served in the same way, and so intent were the garrison upon their mid night sports, that the terrible cry of \" Douglas ! Douglas !\" shouted into the great hall, was the first thing which broke off the revels. In a moment the scene was changed from mirth and joy into a dread ful carnage ; but resistance soon became hopeless, and Douglas gave quarter. De Fiennes retreated to the great tower, and gallantly defended himself, till a deep wound in the face compelled him to surrender.1 He retired to England, and died of his wounds soon af ter. Bruce immediately sent his brother Edward, who levelled the works, and reduced the rest of Te viotdale, with the exception of Jedburgh, which was still garrisoned by the English. At this time, Randolph, Earl of Moray, had strictly beleaguered the castle of Edinburgh, which was com manded by Sir Piers de Luband, a Gascon knight, and a relative of Gaveston, the English king's favourite.2 The garrison suspected the fidelity of this foreigner, and, having cast him into a dungeon, chose a constable of their own nation, who determined to defend the place to the last extremity. Already had the Scots spent six weeks in the siege, when an English soldier, of the name of Frank, presented himself to Randolph, and informed him, he could point out a place where he had himself often scaled the wall, and by which, > Barbour, p. 202, 203. s Monachi Malmesbriensis Vita Edwardi II. p. 144."], [308, "1312. 292 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. he undertook to lead his men into the castle. This man, in his youth, when stationed in the castle, had become enamoured of a girl in the neighbourhood, and for the purpose of meeting her, had discovered a way down and up the steep and perilous cliff, with which custom had rendered him familiar; and Randolph, with thirty determined men, fully armed, placed them- selves under his direction, and resolved to scale the castle at midnight. The surprise, however, was not nearly so complete as at Roxburgh, and the affair far more severely contested. Besides, Randolph had only half the number of men with Douglas, and the night was so dark, that the task of climbing the rock became extremely dangerous. They persevered never- theless, and, on getting about half way up, found a jutting crag, on which they sat down to take breath. The wall was now immediately above them ; and it happened that the check-watches, at this time, were making their round, and challenging the sentinels, whilst Randolph and his soldiers could hear all that passed. At this critical moment, whether from ac- cident, or that one of the watch had really perceived something moving on the rock, a soldier cast a stone down towards the spot where Randolph sat, and call- ed out, \u2014 \" Away ! I see you well.\" But the Scots lay still as death, and the watch moved on. Randolph and his men waited till they had gone to some dis- tance. They then got up, and clambering to the bot- tom of the wall, at a place where it was only twelve feet in height, fixed the iron crochet of their rope ladder on the crib-stone. Frank was the first who"], [309, "1312. ROBERT BRUCE. 293 mounted, then followed Sir Andrew Gray, next came Randolph himself, who was followed by the rest of the party. Before, however, all had got up, the sentinels, who had heard whispering and the clank of arms, at tacked Randolph, and shouted \" Treason !\" They were soon, however, repulsed or slain ; and the Scots, by this time on the parapet, leapt up, and rushed on to the keep, or principal strength. The whole garrison was now in arms, and a very desperate con flict ensued, in which the English greatly outnumber ed their assailants. But panic and surprise deprived them of their accustomed bravery ; and although the governor himself made a gallant defence, he was over powered and slain, and his garrison immediately sur rendered at discretion. Randolph liberated Sir Piers Luband from his dungeon, and the Gascon knight immediately entered the service of Bruce. The castle itself shared the fate of every fortress which fell into the hands of the Scottish king. It was instantly de molished, and rendered incapable of military occupa tion. If we consider the small number of men with which he led, and the perilous circumstances in which the assault was made, we shall probably be inclined to agree with the faithful old historian, who characterises this exploit of Randolph's as one of the hardiest and most chivalrous which distinguished a chivalrous age.1 These great successes so rapidly succeeding each 1 Barbour, pp. 207, 212.

The conferences for a cessation of hostilities were again renewed, at the request of the French king ; aud Edward, with weak ostentation, talked of grant ing a truce to his enemies in compliance with the wishes of Philip,1 which, when it came to the point, his enemies would not grant to him. Soon after this the King of Scotland conducted, in person, a naval expedition against Man. To this island his bitter enemies, the Macdonalls, had retreated, after their expulsion from Galloway, their ancient principality ; and the then governor of Man appears to have been that same fierce chief, who had surprised Thomas and Alexander Bruce at Loch Ryan. Bruce landed his troops, encountered and routed thc governor, stormed the castle of Russin, and completely subdued the island.2 He then dispatched some galleys to levy contributions in Ulster, and returned to Scotland, where he found that his gallant and impetuous bro ther, Sir Edward Bruce, had made himself master of the castle of Rutherglen, and of the town and castle of Dundee, for the preservation of which so many exertions had been made in a former year.

ROBERT BLtUCE. 295 this success, Sir Edward laid siege to the castle of Stirling, nearly the last fortress of importance which now stood between Scotland and freedom. Its go vernor, Philip de Mowbray, after a long and success ful defence, began to dread the failure of provisions in the garrison, and made overtures for a treaty, in which he agreed to surrender the castle by the ensu ing midsummer, if not relieved by an English army. This was evidently a truce involving conditions which ought on no account to have been accepted. Its ne cessary effect, if agreed to, was to check the ardour of the Scots in that career of success which was now rapidly leading to the complete deliverance of their country ; it gave the King of England a whole year to assemble the entire force of his dominions; and such were the chivalrous feelings of that age, as to agreements of this nature, that it compelled the King of Scotland to hazard the fortunes of his kingdom, upon the issue of a battle, which he knew must be fought on his side with a great disparity of force. We need not wonder then at Bruce being highly in censed on hearing that, without consulting him, his brother had agreed to Mowbray's proposals. He dis dained, however, to imitate the conduct of Edward, who, in a former year, and in circumstances precisely similar, had ordered the treaty of Dundee to be bro ken j1 and keeping his knightly faith, he resolved, at all hazards, to meet the English on the appointed day.2 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, 5 Ed.

Edward, having obtained a partial reconciliation with his haughty and discontented barons, made im mense preparations for the succour of the fortress of Stirling. He summoned the whole military force of his kingdoms to meet him at Berwick on the 11th of June.1 To this rendezvous ninety-three barons, com prehending the whole body of the great vassals of the crown, were commanded to repair with horse and arms, and their entire feudal service, whilst the dif ferent counties in England and Wales were ordered to raise a body of twenty-seven thousand foot sol diers ; and although Hume, mistaking, or rather en tirely overlooking, the evidence of the records, has imagined that the numbers of this army have been exaggerated by Barbour, it is certain that the accu mulated strength which the king commanded ex ceeded a hundred thousand men, including a body of forty thousand cavalry, of which three thousand were, both horse and man, in complete armour, and a force of fifty thousand archers. He now appoint ed the Earl of Pembroke, a nobleman experienced, under his father, in the wars of Scotland, to be go vernor of that country, and dispatched him thither to make preparations for his own arrival. He order ed a fleet of twenty-three commissioned vessels to be assembled for the invasion of Scotland ;2 in addition 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. iii. pp. 463, 464.

He took care that ample store of all kinds of provi sions for the troops, and forage for the cavalry, should be collected from all quarters ; he placed his victual ling department under strict and regular organization ; he appointed John of Argyle, who, probably, had no inconsiderable fleet of his own, to co-operate with the English armament, with the title of High Admiral of the western fleet of England ;2 and he took care that the army should be amply provided with all kinds of useful artizans, such as smiths, carpenters, ma sons, armourers, with innumerable waggons and cars for the transport of the tents and pavilions, and all the baggage which so large a military array necessa rily included.

He here found, that the Earls of Warrene, Lancas ter, Arundel, and Warwick, refused to attend him iu person, alleging that he had broken his kingly word given to the lord ordainers, but they sent their feu dal services, and the rest of the nobility mustered, without any absentees, and with great splendour ; so that Edward, having reviewed his troops, began his march for Scotland in high spirits, and with confi dent anticipations of victory. Meanwhile Bruce, aware of the mighty force which was advancing against him, had not been idle. He appointed a rendezvous of his whole army in the Torwood, near Stirling, and here he found, that the greatest force which he could col lect, did not amount to forty thousand fighting men, and that the little cavalry which he had, could not compete for a moment, either in the temper of their arms, or the strength of their horses, with the heavy 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, 7 Ed. II. passim."], [315, "1314. 299 ROBERT BRUCE. cavalry of the English. He at once, therefore, re- solved to fight on foot,1 and to draw up his army in ground where cavalry could not act with effect, and where the English, from their immense numbers, would be cramped and confined in their movements. For this purpose, he chose a field not far from Stir- ling, which was then called the New Park. It was studded and encumbered with trees, and the ap- proach to it was protected by a morass, the passage of which would be dangerous to an enemy. Bruce, having carefully examined the ground, determined that his right wing should rest on the rivulet called Bannockburn, whose steep and wooded banks afford- ed him an excellent security against being outflank- ed. His front thus extended to St Ninians, and his left wing, which was unprotected by the nature of the ground, was exposed to the garrison of Stirling in the rear ; but the terms of the treaty with the governor, precluded all attack from that quarter. But his left was otherwise defended, for in a field hard by, which, from its firm and level nature, afforded scope for ca valry, Bruce caused many rows of parallel pits to be dug, a foot in breadth, and about three feet deep. In these he placed sharp stakes, and covered them care fully with sod, so that the ground, apparently level, was rendered impassable to horse.2 Having thus ju- 1 The Scala Chron. quoted in Leland, torn. i. part ii. p. 547, says, that Bruce determined to fight on foot, after the example of the Flemish troops, who, a little before this, had discomfited the power of France at the battle of Coutray.

The principal leaders of the Scottish army were Sir Edward Bruce, the king's bro ther, Sir James Douglas, Randolph, Earl of Moray, and Walter, the High Steward of Scotland. These, with the exception of the last, who was still a youth, were experienced and veteran leaders, who had been long trained up in war, and upon whom their master could place entire reliance, and having fully explained to them his intended order of battle, the king waited in great tranquillity for the approach of the enemy. Soon after, word was brought that the English army had lain all night at Edinburgh ; and Bruce, on Sun day morning, after hearing mass, rode out to examine the pits which had been made, and to see that his orders had been well executed. Having satisfied him self, he returned, and commanded his soldiers to arm. This order was promptly obeyed ; and after having heard mass, they cheerfully arrayed themselves un der their different banners. Bruce then caused pro clamation to be made, that all who did not feel fully resolved to win the field, or to die with honour, had at that moment free liberty to leave the army ; but the soldiers raised a great shout, and answered with one ac cord, that they were determined to abide the enemy.1 The baggage of the army was placed in a valley at some distance in the rear, and the sutlers and camp followers, who amounted nearly to twenty thousand, 1 Barbour, p. 227."], [317, "1311. 301 ROBERT BRUCE. were stationed beside it, and commanded to await the result of the battle. They were separated from the army by a small hill, which is yet called the Gilles, or Gillies' Hill. The king now arranged his army in a line consist ing of three square columns, or battles, of which he intrusted the leading of the right to his brother Ed ward, of the left to Sir James Douglas, and Walter the Steward, and of the vaward, or centre, to the Earl of Moray.1 He himself took the command of the reserve, which formed a fourth battle, drawn up immediately behind the centre, and composed of the men of Argyle, Carrie, Cantire, and the Isles. Along with him was Angus of Isla, with the men of Bute, and he had also under his command a body of five hundred cavalry, armed in complete steel, and mount ed on light and active horses. Having thus disposed his order of battle, the king dispatched Sir James Douglas and Sir Robert Keith to reconnoitre, who soon after returned with the news, that they descried the English host advancing in great strength, and making a very martial and splen did appearance. For this intelligence Bruce was well prepared, yet, dreading its effect upon his soldiers, he directed them to give out to the army, that the ene my, though numerous, were advancing in confused and ill-arranged order. Although this was not exactly the case, the rash and presumptuous character of Edward led him to commit some errors in the conduct and disposal of his 1 Barbour, p. 224. 7"], [318, "302 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1314. army, which led to fatal consequences. He had hur ried on to Scotland with such rapidity, that the horses were worn out with travel and want of food, and the men were not allowed the regular periods for halt and refreshment, so that his army went into action under a great disadvantage. Upon advancing from Falkirk, early in the morning, and when the English host was only two miles distant from the Scottish army, Ed ward dispatched an advanced party of eight hundred cavalry, led by Sir Robert Clifford, with orders to out flank the enemy, and to throw themselves into Stir ling castle. Bruce had looked for this movement, and had commanded Randolph, his nephew, to be espe cially vigilant in repelling any such attempt. Clif ford, however, unobserved by Randolph, made a cir cuit by the low grounds to the east and north of the church of St Ninians, and having thus avoided the front of the Scottish army, he was proceeding towards the castle, when he was detected by the piercing eye of Bruce, who rode hastily up to Randolph, and angri ly reproached him for his carelessness in having suf fered the enemy to pass. \" Oh, Randolph !\" cried his master, \" lightly have you thought of the charge com mitted to you ; a rose has fallen from your chaplet.\"1 Stung by such words, the Earl of Moray hasted at all hazards to repair his error. As he advanced, Clifford's squadron wheeled round, and putting their spears in rest, charged him at full speed, but Ran dolph had formed his infantry in a square presenting a front on all sides, with the spears fixed firmly be fore them ; and although he had only five hundred men 1 Barbour, p. 231."], [319, "1314. 303 ROBERT BRUCE. with him,1 he awaited the shock of Clifford with such fatal firmness, that many of the English were unhorsed, and Sir William Daynecourt, a knight of great note, who had been more forward in his attack than his com panions, was slain. Unable to make any impression upon Randolph's square by this first charge, the English proceeded more leisurely to surround him on all sides, and by a second furious and simultaneous charge on each front, to endeavour to break the line. But the light armour, the long spears, and the short knives and battle-axes of the Scottish foot, were quite a match for the heavy-armed English cavalry, and a very desperate conflict ensued, in which Randolph's little square, although it stood firm, to a looker-on seemed likely to be crushed to pieces by the heavy metal which was brought against it. All this pass ed in the sight of Bruce, who was surrounded by his officers. At length Sir James Douglas earnestly re quested to be allowed to go with a reinforcement to his relief. \" You shall not stir a foot from your ground,\" said the king, \" and let Randolph extricate himself as best he can ; I will not alter my order of battle, and lose my advantage, whatever may befall him.\" \" My liege,\" answered Douglas, \" I will not stand by, and see Randolph perish, when I may bring him help, so by your leave I must away to his suc cour.\" Bruce unwillingly consented, and Douglas im mediately held his way towards Randolph. By this time the King of England had brought up his main army, and ordered a halt, for the purpose of consul t- 1 Barbour, p. 234."], [320, "304 1314. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. ing with his leaders, whether it was expedient to join battle that same day, or take a night to refresh his troops. By some mistake, however, the centre, or va ward of the English, continued its march, not aware of this order, and on their approach to the New Park, Bruce rode forward alone, to take a final view of the disposition of his army. He was at this time in front of his own line, meanly mounted on a little palfrey, but clad in full armour, with his battle-axe in his hand, and distinguished from his nobles by a small crown of gold surmounting his steel helmet. On the approach of the English vaward, led by the Earls of Gloucester and Hereford, Sir Henry deBoune, an English knight, who rode about a bow-shot in advance of his compa nions, recognised the king, and galloped forward to attack him. Boune was armed at all points, and ex cellently mounted on a heavy war-horse, so that the contest was most unequal, and Bruce ought to have retired ; but for a moment he forgot his duties as a general in his feelings as a knight, and to the surprise of his soldiers, spurred his little palfrey forward to his assailant. There was an interval of breathless sus pense, but it lasted only a moment ; for as the Eng lish knight came in full career, the king parried the spear, and raising himself in his stirrups as he passed, with one blow of his battle-axe laid him dead at his feet, by almost cleaving his head in two.1 Upon this his soldiers raised a great shout, and advanced hardi ly upon the English centre, which retreated in con fusion to the main army, and Bruce, afraid of disor- 1 Barbour, pp. 235, 236."], [321, "1314. 305 ROBERT BRUCE. der getting into his line of battle, called back his men from the pursuit, after they had slain a few of the English soldiers. When they had time to recol lect themselves, the Scottish leaders earnestly remon strated with the king for the rash manner in which he exposed himself; and Bruce, somewhat ashamed of the adventure, changed the subject, and looking at the broken shaft which he held in his hand, with a smile replied, \" He was sorry for the loss of his good battle axe.\" In the meantime, the contest between Randolph and Clifford was still undecided ; but Douglas, as he drew near, to his friend's rescue, perceived that the English had by this time begun to waver, and that disorder was rapidly getting into their ranks. Com manding his men, therefore, to halt, \" Let us not,\" cried he, \" diminish the glory of so redoubtable an encounter, by coming in at the end to share it. The brave men that fight yonder, without our help will soon discomfit the enemy.\" And the result was as Douglas had foreseen ; for Randolph, who quickly perceived the same indications, began to press the English cavalry with repeated charges and increasing fury, so that they at length entirely broke, and fled in great disorder. The attempt to throw succours into the castle was thus completely defeated ; and Clifford, after losing a great many of his men, who were slain in the pursuit, rejoined the main body of the army with the scattered and dispirited remains of his squa dron. So steadily had the Scots kept their ranks, that Randolph had sustained a very inconsiderable vol. i. u"], [322, "1314. 306 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. loss. From the result of these two attacks, and espe cially from the defeat of Clifford, Bruce drew a good augury, and cheerfully and kindly congratulated his soldiers on so fair and fortunate a beginning. He observed to them, that they had defeated the flower of the English cavalry, and had driven back the centre division of their great army ; and remarked, that the same circumstances which gave spirit and animation to their hopes, must communicate depression to the enemy. As the day was far spent, he held a mi litary council of his leaders, and requested their ad vice, whether, having now seen the numbers and strength of their opponents, it was expedient to ha zard a battle, declaring himself ready to submit his individual opinion to the judgment of the majori ty. But the minds of the Scottish commanders were not in a retreating mood ; and although aware of the immense disparity of force, the English army heing more than triple that of Bruce, they declared that it was their unanimous desire to keep their po sition, and to fight on the morrow. The king then told them that such was his own wish, and command ed them to have the whole army arrayed next morn ing by daybreak, in the order and upon the ground already agreed on. He earnestly exhorted them to preserve the firmest order, each man under his own banner, and to receive the charge of the English with levelled spears, so that even the hindmost ranks of the English would feel the shock. He pointed out to them, that everything in the approaching battle, which was to determine whether Scotland was to be free or"], [323, "1314. ROBERT BRUCE. 307 enslaved, depended on their own steady discipline and deliberate valour. He conjured them not to allow a single soldier to quit his banner or break the array ; and, if they should be successful, by no means to begin to plunder or to make prisoners, as long as a single enemy remained on the field. He promised that the heirs of all who fell should receive their lands free, and without the accustomed feudal fine ; and he assured them, with a determined and cheerful coun tenance, that if the orders he had now given were obeyed, they might confidently look forward to vic tory. Having thus spoken to his leaders, the army were dismissed to their quarters. In the evening, they made the necessary arrangements for the battle, and passed the night in arms upon the field. Meanwhile the English King and his leaders had resolved, on account of the fatigue of the army, and symptoms of dissatisfaction which appeared amongst the soldiers, to delay the attack, and drew off to the low grounds to the right and rear of their original position, where they passed the night in great riot and revelry. At this time, it is said, a Scotsman, who served in the English army, deserted to Bruce, and informed him he could lead him to the attack so as to secure an easy victory. The king, however, was not thus to be drawn from his position, and determined to await the attack of the enemy on the ground already chosen. On Monday, the 24th of June, at the first break of day, the Scottish army heard mass. This solemn ceremony was performed by Maurice, the Abbot of"], [324, "1314. 308 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Inchaffray, upon an eminence in front of their line, and after its conclusion the soldiers took breakfast, and arranged themselves under their different ban ners. They wore light armour, but of excellent tem per. Their weapons were, a battle-axe slung at their side, and long spears, besides knives, or daggers, which the former affair of Randolph had proved to be terri bly effective in close combat. When the whole army was in array, they proceeded, with displayed banners, to make knights, as was the custom before a battle. Bruce conferred that honour upon Walter, the young Steward of Scotland, Sir James Douglas, and many other brave men, in due order, and according to their rank. By this time the van of the English army, compo sed of archers and lancemen, and led by the Earls of Gloucester and Hereford, approached within bowshot; and at a little distance behind, the remaining nine divisions, which, confined by the narrowness of the ground, were compressed into a close column of great and unwieldy dimensions. This vast body was con ducted by the King of England in person, who had along with him a body-guard of five hundred chosen horse. He was attended by the Earl of Pembroke, Sir Ingram Umfraville, and Sir Giles de Argentine, a Knight of Rhodes, and of great reputation. When Edward approached near enough, and observed the Scottish army drawn up on foot, and their firm array and determined countenance, he expressed great sur prise, and turuing to Umfraville, asked him \" if he thought yon Scots would fight ?\" Umfraville replied,"], [325, "1314. 309 ROBERT BRUCE. that they assuredly would ; and he then advised Ed ward, instead of an open attack, to pretend to retreat behind his encampment, upon which he was confi dent, from his old experience in the Scottish wars, that the Scots would break their array, and rush on without order or discipline, so that the English army might easily attack and overwhelm them. Umfra ville, an Anglicized Scottish baron, who had seen much service against Edward's father, and had only sworn fealty in 1305, spoke this from an intimate knowledge of his countrymen ; but Edward fortu nately disdained his counsel. At this moment the Abbot of Inchaffray, barefooted, and with a crucifix in his hand, walked slowly along the Scottish line, and as he passed, the whole army knelt down with one consent, and prayed for a moment with the so lemnity of men who felt it might be their last act of devotion. \" See,\" cried Edward, \" they are kneeling \u2014 they ask mercy.\" \u2014 \" They do, my liege,\" replied Umfraville, \" but it is from God, not from us. Trust me, yon men will win the day, or die upon the field.\" \u2014 \" Be it so, then,\" said Edward, and bade the charge be sounded. The English van, led by Gloucester and Hereford, spurred forward their horses, and at full gallop charged the right wing of the Scots, command ed by Edward Bruce ; but an unhappy dispute be tween the two English barons as to precedency, caused the charge, though rapid, to be broken and irregular. Gloucester, who had been irritated the day before by some galling remarks of the king, insisted on leading the charge, a post which of right belonged to Hereford,"], [326, "310 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1314. as Constable of England. To this Hereford would by no means agree, aud Gloucester, as they disputed, seeing the Scottish right advancing, sprung forward at the head of his own division, and, without being duly supported by the rest of the van, attacked the enemy, who received them with a shock, which cau- sed the noise of the meeting of their spears to be heard a great way off, and threw many good knights from their saddles, whose horses were stabbed, and rendered furious by their wounds. While the right wing was thus engaged, Randolph, who commanded the centre division, advanced at a steady pace to meet the main body of the English, whom he confronted and attacked with great boldness, although the enemy out- numbered him by ten to one ; so that his square, to use an expression of Barbour's, was soon surrounded and lost amidst the English, as if it had plunged into the sea ; upon which Sir James Douglas and Walter the Steward brought up the left wing ; so that the whole line, composed of the three battles, was now en- gaged, and the battle raged with great fury. The Eng- lish cavalry attempting, by repeated charges, to break the line of the Scottish spearmen, and they standing firm in their array, and presenting on every side a ser ried front of steel, caused a shock and melee, which is not easily described ; and the slaughter was increased, by the remembrance of many years of grievous injury and oppression, producing, on the part of the Scots, an exasperation of feeling, and an eager desire of re venge. At every successive charge, the English ca valry lost more men, and fell into greater confusion,"], [327, "1314. ROBERT BRUCE. 311 than before ; and this confusion was infinitely in creased by the confined nature of the ground, and the immense mass of their army. The Scottish squares, on the other hand, were light and compact, though firm ; they moved easily, altered their front at plea sure, and suited themselves to every emergency of the battle. They were, however, dreadfully galled by the English archers, and Bruce, dreading the effect of the constant and uninterrupted arrow-flight, which fell like hail upon them, directed Sir Robert Keith, the marshal, to make a circuit, with the five hundred horse which were in the reserve, round the morass called Miltown Bog, and to charge the archers in flank. This movement was executed with great decision and rapidity ; and such was its effect, that the whole body of the archers, who had neither spears nor other wea pons to defend themselves against cavalry, were in a short time overthrown and dispersed, without any pro longed attempt at resistance. Part of them fled to the main army, and the rest did not again attempt to rally or make head during the continuance of the battle. Although such was the success of this ju dicious attack, the English still kept fighting with great determination ; but they had already lost some of their bravest commanders, and Bruce could discern symptoms of fatigue and impatient exhaustion. He saw, too, that his own infantry were still fresh and well-breathed ; and he assured his leaders that the at tack, continued but for a short time, and pushed with vigour, must make the day their own. It was at this moment that he brought up his whole reserve, and the"], [328, "312 1314. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. four battles of the Scots were now completely enga ged in one line. The Scottish archers, unlike the English, carried short battle-axes, besides the bow ; and with these, after they exhausted their arrows, they rushed upon the enemy, and made great ha voc. The Scottish commanders, too, the King, Ed ward Bruce, Douglas, Randolph, and the Steward, were fighting in the near presence of each other, and animated with a generous rivalry. At this time, Barbour, whose admirable account is evidently taken from eye-witnesses, describes the field as exhibiting a terrific spectacle. \" It was awful,\" says he, \" to hear the noise of these four battles fighting in a line, the clang of arms, the shouts of the knights as they raised their war-cry; to see the flight of the arrows, which maddened the horses, the alternate sinking and rising of the banners, and the ground streaming with blood, and covered with shreds of ar mour, broken spears, pennons, and rich scarfs, torn and soiled with blood and clay, and to listen to the groans of the wounded and the dying.\" The waver ing of the English lines was now discernible by the Scottish soldiers themselves ; and raising at once a great shout, \" On them, on them \u2014 they fail !\" they pressed forward with renewed energy and fury, gain ing ground upon their enemy. At this critical mo ment, there appeared over the little hill, which lay between the field and the baggage of the Scottish army, a large body of troops, with banners waving, and marching in firm array towards the battle. This spectacle, which was instantly believed to be a rein-"], [329, "1314. ROBERT BRUCE. 313 forcement proceeding to join the Scots, although it was nothing more than the sutlers and camp-boys hastening to see the battle, spread dismay amidst the ranks of the English ; and King Robert, whose eye was everywhere, to perceive and take advantage of the slightest movement in his favour, put himself at the head of his reserve, and raising his ensenye, or war-cry, furiously pressed on the enemy. It was this last charge, which was followed up by the advance of the whole line, that decided the day ; the Eng lish, who hitherto, although wavering, had preserved their array, now broke into disjointed squadrons ; part began to quit the field, and no efforts of their leaders could restore order. The Earl of Gloucester, who was mounted on a beautiful and spirited war-horse, which had lately been presented to him by the king,1 in one of his attempts to rally his men, rode furiously upon the division of Edward Bruce ; he was instantly unhorsed, and fell transpierced by numerous wounds of the Scottish lances The flight now became general, and the slaughter very great. The banners of twenty seven barons were laid in the dust, and their masters slain. Amongst these were Sir Robert Clifford, a veteran and experienced commander, and Sir Ed mund Mauley, the Seneschal of England. On see ing the entire rout of his army, Edward reluctant ly allowed the Earl of Pembroke to seize his bri- 1 Hutchinson's Hist, and Antiquities of the Palatinate of Dur ham, p. 261. \" The Bishop of Durham, Richard Kellow, had a short time before presented this war-horse, an animal of high price, along with 1000 marks, to King Edward.\""], [330, "1314. 314 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. die, and force him away, guarded by five hundred heavy-armed horse.1 Sir Giles de Argentine accom panied him a short way off the field, till he saw the king in safety. He then reined up, and bade him farewell. \" It has never been my custom,\" said he, \" to fly, and here I must take my fortune.\" Saying this, he put spurs to his horse, and crying out, \" an Argentine !\" charged the squadron of Edward Bruce, and, like Gloucester, was soon borne down by the dreadful force of the Scottish spears, and cut to pieces. Multitudes of the English were drowned when at tempting to cross the river Forth. Many others, who vainly endeavoured to pass the rugged banks of the stream, called Bannockburn, were slain in that quar ter ; so that this little river was so completely heaped up with the dead bodies of men and horses, that men might pass dry over the mass as if it were a bridge. Thirty thousand of the English were left dead upon the field, and amongst these two hundred belted knights, and seven hundred esquires. A large body of Welsh fled from the field, under the command of Sir Maurice Berkclay, but the greater part of them were slain, or taken prisoners, before they reached England. Such, also, might have been the fate of the King of England himself, had Bruce been able to spare a sufficient body of cavalry to follow up the flight. But when Edward left the field, with his five hundred horse, many straggling parties of the enemy 1 One writer, Thomas de la More, Britann. p. 594, accuses Ed ward of cowardice ; but I see no ground for this opinion."], [331, "1314. ROBERT BRUCE. 315 still lingered about the low grounds, and great num bers had taken refuge under the walls, and in the hollow recesses of the rock, on which Stirling castle is built. These, had they rallied, might have still created much annoyance, as a part of the Scot tish army was dispersed in the occupation of plun dering the camp, and securing its numerous prison ers ; and it became absolutely necessary for Bruce to keep the more efficient part of his troops together. When Douglas, therefore, proposed to pursue the king, he could obtain no more than sixty horsemen. In passing the Torwood, he was met by Sir Laurence Abernethy, hastening with a small body of cavalry to join the English rendezvous. This knight imme diately deserted a falling cause, and joined in the chase. Although, however, they made up to the fu gitive monarch at Lithgow, Douglas deemed it im prudent to attack with so inferior a force. He press ed so hard upon him, however, as not to suffer them to have a moment's rest ; and it is a strong proof of the extreme panic which had seized the English, that a body of five hundred heavy horse, armed to the teeth, fled before eighty Scottish cavalry, with out daring to make a stand. But it is probable they believed Douglas to be the advance of the ar my.1 Edward at last gained the castle of Dunbar, where he was hospitably received by the Earl of March, and from which he passed by sea to Berwick. In the meantime, Bruce sent a party to attack the 1 Henry Knighton, p. 151. Walsingham, p. 106."], [332, "316 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1314. fugitives who clustered round the rock of Stirling. These were immediately made prisoners, and having ascertained that no enemy remained, the king permit ted his soldiers to pursue the fugitives, and plunder the camp of the English. The unfortunate stragglers were slaughtered by the peasantry, as they scattered themselves over the country, and many of them cast away their arms and accoutrements, and hid them selves, or fled almost naked from the field.1 Some idea of the extent and variety of the rich booty which was divided by the Scottish soldiers, may be formed from the circumstance mentioned by an English his torian, \" That the chariots, waggons, and wheeled carriages, which were loaded with the baggage and military stores, would, if drawn up in a line, have ex tended for sixty leagues.\" 2 These, along with numerous herds of cattle, and flocks of sheep and swine, with great store of hay, corn, and wine, with the vessels of gold and silver be longing to the king and his nobility, the money chests holding the treasure for the payment of the troops, an infinite assemblage of splendid arms, rich wearing apparel, sumptuous stuffs, and horse and tent furniture out of the royal wardrobe and private repositories of the earls, and barons, and knights, to gether with a great booty in valuable horses and in tent equipage \u2014 these, and a variety of other plunder, fell into the hands of the conquerors, and were distri buted by Bruce amongst his soldiers with a genero- 1 Monachi Malmesbur. p. 151. 2 Ibid. p. 147."], [333, "1314. ROBERT BRUCE. 317 sity and impartiality which rendered him highly and deservedly popular. Besides these, Edward had brought along with him many instruments of war, and machines employed in the besieging of towns, such as petronels, trebuchets, mangonels, and batter ing rams, which, intended for the demolition of the Scottish castles, now fell into the hands of Bruce, to be turned, in future wars, against England. The li ving booty, too, in the many prisoners of rank who were taken, was very great. Twenty-two barons and bannerets, and sixty knights, fell into the hands of the Scots, and their ransom must have amounted to a very large sum. Considering the grievous inju ries which he had personally sustained, the King of Scotland evinced a generous and noble forbearance in the uses of his victory, which does him the highest ho nour ; not only was there no unnecessary slaughter, no uncalled-for severity of retaliation, but, in their place, we find a high-toned courtesy, which has called forth the praises even of his enemies.1 The body of the young and noble Earl of Gloucester was reverently carried to a neighbouring church, where it was watch ed according to Catholic rites. It was afterwards sent to England, along with the last remains of the brave Lord Clifford, to be interred with the honours due to their high rank. The rest of the slain were ho nourably buried upon the field. Early next morning, as the king examined the field, Sir Marmaduke de Twenge, who had lurked all night in the woods, pre- ' Joh. de Trokelowe, p. 28,"], [334, "318 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1314. sented himself to Bruce, and, kneeling down, deli vered himself as his prisoner. Bruce kindly raised him, retained him in his company for some time, and then dismissed him, not only without ransom, but en riched with presents. It happened, that one Baston, a Carmelite friar, and esteemed an excellent poet, had been commanded by Edward to accompany the army, that he might immortalize the expected triumph of his master. He was taken ; and Bruce commanded him, as his most appropriate ransom, to celebrate the victory of the Scots at Bannockburn \u2014 a task which he has accom plished in a composition which is a very extraordi nary relic of the Leonine, or rhyming hexameters. On the day after the battle, Mowbray, the English governor of Stirling, having delivered up that for tress, according to the terms of the truce, entered into the service of the King of Scotland ; and the Earl of Hereford, who had taken refuge in Bothwell castle, then in the hands of the English, capitulated, after a short siege, to Edward Bruce. This nobleman was exchanged for five illustrious prisoners, Bruce's wife, his sister Christian, his daughter Marjory, Wis heart the Bishop of Glasgow, now blind, and the young Earl of Mar, nephew to the king. John de Segrave, made prisoner at Bannockburn, was ransomed for five Scottish barons ; so that, in these exchanges, the Eng lish appear to have received nothing like au adequate value. The riches obtained by the plunder of the English, and the subsequent ransom paid for the multitude of the prisoners, must have been very great."], [335, "1314. ROBERT BRUCE. 319 Their exact amount cannot be easily estimated, but some idea of its greatness may be formed by the tone of deep lamentation assumed by the Monk of Malmes bury. \" O day of vengeance and of misfortune ! day of disgrace and perdition ! unworthy to be included in the circle of the year, which tarnished the fame of England, and enriched the Scots with the plunder of the precious stuffs of our nation, to the extent of two hundred thousand pounds.

The loss of the Scots in the battle was incredibly small, and proves how effectually the Scottish squares had repelled the English cavalry. Sir William Vi pont, and Sir Walter Ross, the bosom friend of Ed ward Bruce, were the only persons of note who were slain.2 Such was the great battle of Bannockburn, inte resting above all others which have been fought be tween the then rival nations, if we consider the issue which hung upon it, and very glorious to Scotland, 1 Mon.

Its consequences were in the highest degree important. It put an end for ever to all hopes upon the part of England of accomplishing the conquest of her sister country. The plan, of which we can discern the foundations as far back as the reign of Alexander III., and for the furtherance of which the first Edward was content to throw away so much of treasure, and blood, and character, was put down in the way in which all such schemes ought to be defeated, by the strong hand of free-born men, who were determined to remain so ; and the spirit of indignant resistance to foreign power, which had been awakened by Wallace, but crushed for a season by the dissensions of a jealous and an ambitious nobility, was directed and concen trated by the master-spirit of Bruce, and found fully adequate to overwhelm the united military energies of a kingdom, far superior to Scotland in all that con stituted military strength. Nor have the consequences of this victory been partial or confined. Their dura tion throughout succeeding centuries of Scottish his tory and Scottish liberty, down to the hour in which we now write, cannot be questioned ; and without launching out into any inappropriate field of histori cal speculation, we have only to think of the most ob vious consequences which must have resulted from Scotland becoming a conquered province of England ; and if we wish for proof, to fix our eyes on the present 7"], [337, "1314. 321 ROBERT BRUCE. condition of Ireland, in order to feel the present rea lity of all that we owe to the victory at Bannockburn, and to the memory of such men as Bruce, Randolph, and Douglas.

The weak and undecided character of the king infected his dis contented nobility, and the common soldiers, having lost all confidence in their officers, became feeble and dispirited in themselves. \" A hundred English would not hesitate,\" says Walsingham, \" to fly from two or three Scottish soldiers, so grievously had their wonted courage deserted them.\" * Taking ad vantage of this dejection, the king, in the beginning of autumn,2 sent Douglas and Edward Bruce across the eastern marches, with an army which wasted Northumberland, and carried fire and sword through 1 Walsingham, p. 106. 2 It was before the 10th of August.

They next pushed forward into York shire, and plundered Richmond, driving away an im mense body of cattle, and making many prisoners. On their way homeward they burnt Appleby and Kirkwold, sacked and set fire to the villages in their route, and found the English so utterly dispirited, that their army reached Scotland, loaded with spoil, aud unchallenged by an enemy.1 Edward, indignant at their successes, issued his writs for the muster of a new army to be assembled from the different wapen tachs of Yorkshire, commanded ships to be commis sioned and victualled for a second Scottish expedition, and appointed the Earl of Pembroke to be governor of the country, between Berwick and the river Trent, with the arduous charge of defending it against the reiterated attacks, and, to use t^e words of the royal commission, \" the burnings, slaughters, and inhuman and sacrilegious depredations of the Scots.\" 2 These, however, were only parchment levies ; and before a single vessel was manned, or a single horseman had put his foot in the stirrup, the indefatigable Bruce had sent a second army into England, which ravaged Redesdale and Tinedale, again marking their progress by the black ashes of the towns and villages, and compelling the miserable inhabitants of the border countries to surrender their whole wealth, and to pur chase their lives with great sums of money.3 From 1 Chron.

Edward immediately confirmed this nomination, and for the pressing nature of the emergency, the measure was not impolitic ; but these border troops soon for got their allegiance, upon the failure of their re gular supplies from the king's exchequer, became little better than the Scots themselves, plundering the coun try, and subsisting themselves by every species of theft, robbery,2 and murder.

Negotiations soon after fol lowed. Four Scottish ambassadors met with the commissioners of England, and various attempts were made for the establishment of a perpetual peace, or at least of a temporary truce, between the rival coun tries ; but these entirely failed, owing, probably, to the high tone assumed by the Scottish envoys, and the termination of this destructive war appeared still more distant than before.1 Towards the end of this year, so glorious to Scotland, the unfortunate John Baliol died in exile at his ancient patrimonial castle of Bailleul, in France, having lived to see the utter demolition of a power which had insulted and de throned him. He had been suffered to retain a small property in England, and his eldest son appears to have been living in that country, and under the pro tection of Edward, at the time of his father's death.2 In addition to the miseries of foreign war and in testine commotion, England was now visited with a grievous famine, which increased to an excessive de gree the prices of provisions, and, combined with the frequent and destructive visitations of the Scots, reduced the kingdom to a very miserable condition.

The famine which had begun in England, now extended to Scotland ; and as that country became dependent upon foreign importation, the merchants of England, Ireland, and Wales, were rigorously in- terdicted from supplying Scotland with grain, cattle, arms, or any other commodities. Small squadrons of ships were employed to cruize round the island, so as to intercept all foreign supplies, and letters were di rected to the Earl of Flanders, and to the Counts of Holland, Lunenburgh, and Brabant, requesting them to put a stop to all commercial intercourse between their dominions and the same country, a request with 1 Rotuli Parl. 8 Edw.

Carrying their arms to the gates of York, they desolated the country with fire aud sword, and reduced the wretched English to the lowest extremity of poverty and despair.2 Carlisle, Newcastle, and Berwick, defended by strong fortifications, and well garrisoned, were now the only cities of refuge where there was security for property ; and to these towns the peasantry flocked for protection, whilst the barons and nobility, instead of assembling their vassals to re pel the common enemy, spent their time in riot and licentiousness in the capital.3 An important measure, relating to the succession of the crown, now occupied the attention of the Scot tish king and his parliament. By a solemn act of settlement, it was determined, with the consent of the king, and of his daughter and presumptive heir, Mar jory, that the crown, iu the event of Bruce's death, 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, 8 Edw.

It was moreover provided, with consent of the king, and of his brother Edward, that, failing Edward and his heirs male, Marjory should immediately succeed ; and failing her, the nearest heir lineally descended of the body of King Robert ; but under the express condition, that Mar jory should not marry without the consent of her fa ther, and failing him, of the majority of the estates of Scotland. If it happened, that either the king, or his brother Edward, or Marjory his daughter, should die, leaving an heir male, who was a minor, in that event Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray, was consti tuted guardian of the heir, and of the kingdom, till the estates of Scotland considered the heir of a fit age to administer the government in his own person ; and in the event of the death of Marjory, without chil dren, the same noble person was appointed to this high office, if he chose to accept the burden, until the states and community of the kingdom should, in their wis dom, determine the rightful succession to the crown.1 Not long after this, the king bestowed his daugh ter Marjory in marriage upon Walter the hereditary High-Steward of Scotland ; an important union, which gave heirs to the Scottish crown, and afterwards to the throne of the United Kingdoms.2 An extraordinary episode in the history of Scot land, now claims our attention.

He was accompanied by the Earl of Moray, Sir Philip Mowbray, Sir John Soulis, Sir Fer gus of Ardrossan, and Ramsay of Ochterhouse.

He was now solemnly crowned King of Ireland, and immediately after his assumption of the regal dignity, laid siege to Carrickfergus. On being informed of the situation of his brother's affairs, King Robert intrusted the go- vernment of the kingdom to his son-in-law, the Stew- ard, and Sir James Douglas. He then passed over to the assistance of the new king, with a considerable body of troops ; and after their junction, the united armies, having reduced Carrickfergus, pushed forward through the county Louth to Slane, and beleaguered Dublin ; but being compelled to raise the siege, they advanced into Kilkenny, wasted the country as far as Limerick, and after experiencing the extremities of famine, and defeating the enemy wherever they made head against them, terminated a glorious but fruitless expedition, by a retreat into the province of Ulster, in the spring of 1317.1 The King of Scotland now returned to his domi nions, taking along with him the Earl of Moray, but having left the flower of his army to support his brother in the possession of Ulster. A miserable fate awaited these brave men. After a long period of in action, in which neither the Irish annals nor our early Scottish historians afford any certain light, we find King Edward Bruce encamped at Tagher, near Dun- 1 Fordun a Hearne, p. 1008."], [347, "1315.

Against him, Lord John Bermingham, along with John Mau pas, Sir Miles Verdon, Sir Hugh Tripton, and other Anglo-Irish barons, led an army which was strong in cavalry, and outnumbered the Scots by nearly ten to one. Edward, with his characteristic contempt of danger, and nothing daunted by the appalling dispa rity of force, determined, against the advice of his oldest captains, to give the enemy battle. In the course of a three years' war, he had already engaged the Anglo-Irish forces eighteen times, and although his success had led to no important result, he had been uniformly victorious.1 But his fiery career was now destined to be quenched, and his shortlived sove reignty to have an end. On the 5th of October 1318, the two armies joined battle, and the Scots were al most immediately discomfited.2 At the first onset, John Maupas slew King Edward Bruce, and was himself found slain, and stretched upon the body of his enemy. Sir John Soulis and Sir John Stewart3 also fell, and the rout becoming general, the slaugh ter was very great.

Two thousand Scottish soldiers were left dead upon the field, and amongst these some brave and distin guished captains.1 Thus ended an expedition which, if conducted by a spirit of more judicious and delibe rate valour than distinguished its prime mover, might have produced the most serious annoyance to Eng land. Unmindful of the generous courtesy of Bruce's behaviour after the battle of Bannockburn, the Eng lish treated the body of the King of Ireland with churlish indignity. It was quartered and distributed as a public spectacle over Ireland, and the head was presented to the English King by Lord John Ber mingham, who, as a reward for his victory, was crea ted Earl of Louth.2 Having given a continuous sketch of this disastrous enterprise, which, from its commencement till the death of Edward, occupied a period of three years, we shall return to the affairs of Scotland, where the wise and excellent administration of King Robert conti nued to be crowned with merited success both at home and abroad. The ships which had transported Edward Bruce and his army to Ireland, were immediately sent home ; and Robert undertook an expedition against the West ern Isles, some of which had acknowledged his domi- 1 Their names will be found in Trivet, contin. p. 29. 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. iii. p. 767."], [349, "1315.

Al though constantly occupied in a land war, during the course of which he had brought his army into an ad mirable state of discipline, Bruce had never been blind to the strength which he must acquire by having a fleet which could cope with the maritime power of his rival ; and from the complaints of the English mo narch in the state papers of the times, we know, that on both sides of the island, the Scottish vessels, and those of their allies, kept the English coast towns in a state of constant alarm.2 Their fleets seem to have been partly composed of privateers, as well Flemish as Scotch, which, under the protection of the king, roved about, and attacked the English merchantmen. Thus, during Edward Bruce's expedition, he met, when on the Irish coast, and surrounded with difficulties, with Thomas of Doune, a Scottish \" scoumar,\" or freebooter, \" of the se,\" who, with a small squadron of four ships, sailed up the river Ban, and extricated his countrymen from their5 perilous situation.

The distance was little more than an English mile, and by this expedient Bruce not only was saved the necessity of doubling the Mull of Kentire, to the small craft of those days often a fatal enterprise, but he availed himself of a superstitious belief then current amongst the Western islanders, that they should never be subdued till their invader sailed across the isthmus of Tarbat.1 The presence of the king in the Western Isles was soon followed by the submission of all the little pirate chiefs who had given him disturbance, and by the capture and impri sonment of John of Lorn, who, since his defeat at Cruachin Ben, had been constantly in the pay of Ed ward, with the proud title of Admiral of the Western fleet of England.2 This island prince was first com mitted to Dumbarton castle, and afterwards shut up in the castle of Lochlevin, where he died.3 After the termination of his peaceful maritime campaign, the 1 Barbour, b. x. 1. 850, p. 302.

Berwick, too, was threatened from the side next the sea by the Scottish ships, which attempted to steal up the river unperceived by the enemy, but were discovered, and bravely repulsed.2 Against these reiterated insults, Edward, unable from his extreme unpopularity to raise an army, contented himself with querulous complaints, and with some ineffectual advances towards a reconciliation,3 which as yet was far distant. About this time, to the great joy of the King of Scotland and of the nation, the Princess Marjory bore a son, Robert, who was destined, after the death of David, his uncle, to succeed to the throne, and be come the first of the royal house of Stewart ; but grief soon followed joy, for the young mother died al- 1 Leland, Collect, vol. i. p. 24.

On one side they attacked Wales, apparently making descents from their ships upon the coast ; and Edward, trembling for the security of his new principality, countermand ed the Welsh levies, which were about to join his ar my, and enjoined them to remain at home ; but he accompanied this with an order to give hostages for their fidelity, naturally dreading the effect of the ex ample of the Scots upon a nation, whose fetters were yet new and galling.2 On the other side, King Ro bert in person led his army, about midsummer, into Yorkshire, and wasted the country, without meeting an enemy, as far as Richmond. A timely tribute, collected by the neighbouring barons and gentlemen, saved this town from the flames ; but this merely al tered the order of march into the West Riding, which was cruelly sacked and spoiled for sixty miles round, after which the army returned with a great booty and many prisoners.3 Bruce then embarked for Ireland ; and soou after, the English king, encouraged by the absence of Bruce and Randolph, summoned his mili- 1 Fordun a Goodal, b. xii. c. 25.

In Douglas, the romantic spirit of chivalry was finely united with the character of an experienced command er. At this time he held his quarters at Linthaughlee, near Jedburgh, aud having information that the Earl of Arundel, with Sir Thomas de Richemont, and an English force of ten thousand men, had crossed the Borders, he determined to attack him in a narrow pass, through which his line of march lay, and which was flanked on each side by a wood. Douglas, after having thickly twisted together the young birch trees so as to prevent escape,2 concealed his archers in a hollow way near the gorge of the pass, and when the English ranks were compressed by the narrowness of the road, and it was impossible for their cavalry to act with effect, he rushed upon them at the head of his horsemen, and the archers, suddenly discovering them selves, poured in a flight of arrows, so that the un wieldy mass were thrown into confusion, an\u00abt took to flight. In the mehfe, Douglas slew Thomas de Riche- 2 Barbour, p. 324, 1 Tyrrel, vol. iii. p. 267. VOL. I."], [354, "1317. 338 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND, mont with his dagger ; and although, from his infe riority of force, he did not venture to pursue the ene my into the open country, yet they were compelled to retreat with great slaughter.1 Soon after this, Edmund de Cailou, a knight of Gascony, whom Edward had appointed to be governor of Berwick, was encountered by Douglas, as the fo reigner returned to England loaded with plunder, from an inroad into Teviotdale. Cailou was killed ; and, after the slaughter of many of the foreign mer cenaries, the accumulated booty of the Merse and Te viotdale was recovered by the Scots. Exactly simi lar to that of Cailou, was the fate of Sir Ralph Ne ville. This proud baron, on hearing the high report of Douglas's prowess from some of de Cailou's fugi tive soldiers, openly boasted that he would fight with the Scottish knight, if he would come and show his banner before Berwick. Douglas, who deemed him self bound to accept the challenge, immediately march ed into the neighbourhood of that town, and, within sight of the garrison, caused a party of his men to waste the country, and burn the villages. Neville in stantly quitted Berwick with a strong body of men, and, encamping upon a high ground, waited till the Scots should disperse to plunder ; but Douglas call ed in his detachment, and instantly marched against the enemy. After a desperate conflict, in which many were slain, Douglas, as was his custom, succeeded in bringing the leader to a personal encounter, and the 1 Leland, Collect, vol. i. p. ii. p. 547. Barbour, p. 323."], [355, "1317. ROBERT BRUCE. 339 superior strength and skill of the Scottish knight were again successful. Neville was slain, and his men ut terly discomfited.1 An old English chronicle ascribes this disaster to \" the treason of the marchers ;\" but it is difficult to discover in what the treason consist ed. Many other soldiers of distinction were taken prisoners, and Douglas, without opposition, ravaged the country, drove away the cattle, left the towns aud villages in flames, and returned to Scotland. So terrible did the exploits of this hardy warrior be come upon the Borders, that Barbour, who lived in his time, informs us, the English mothers were ac customed to pacify their children by threatening them with the name of the \" Black Douglas.\"2 Re pulsed with so much disgrace in these attempts by land, the English monarch fitted out a fleet, and in vaded Scotland, by sailing into the Firth of Forth, and landing his armament at Dunybirstle. The pa nic created by the English was so great, that the she riff of the county had difficulty in assembling five hun dred cavalry, and these, intimidated by the superior numbers of the enemy, disgracefully took to flight.3 1 Leland, Collect, vol. i. p. 547.

Barbour men tions, that the English landed to the west of Inverkeithing ; and Hailes observes, that as Fordun affirms they landed at Dunybirstle,"], [356, "340 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1317. Fortunately, however, a spirited prelate, Sinclair, Bi shop of Dunkeld, who had more in him of the warrior than the ecclesiastic, received timely notice of this de sertion. Putting himself at the head of sixty of his servants, and with nothing ecclesiastical about him, except a linen frock, or rochet, cast over his armour, he threw himself on horseback, and succeeded in ral lying the fugitives, telling their leaders that they were recreant knights, and deserved to have their gilt spurs hacked off. \" Turn,\" said he, seizing a spear from the nearest soldier, \" turn, for shame, and let all who love Scotland follow me.\" With this he furiously charged the English, who were driven back to their ships with the loss of five hundred men, besides many who were drowned by the swamping of one of the vessels. On his return from Ireland, Bruce highly commended his spirit, declaring that Sinclair should be his own bi shop ; and by the name of the King's Bishop, this hardy prelate was long remembered in Scotland.1 Unable to make any impression with temporal arms, the King of England next had recourse to the thunders of spiritual warfare ; and in the servile and interested character of Pope John the Twenty-Se cond, he found a fit tool for his purpose. By a bull, issued from Avignon, in the heginning of 1317, the Pope commanded the observance of a truce between the discrepancy shoWs that he did not implicitly follow Barbour. Fordun, however, does not mention the invasion at all. It is Bower, his continuator, whom his lordship means. 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 259."], [357, "1317. 341 ROBERT BRUCE. the hostile countries for two years ; but the style of this mandate evinced a decided partiality to Eng land. Giving the title of King of England to Ed ward, he only designated Bruce as his beloved son, \" carrying himself as King of Scotland -,\"1 and when he dispatched two cardinals as his legates into Bri tain, for the purpose of publishing this truce upon the spot, they were privately empowered, in case of any opposition, to inflict upon the King of Scotland the highest spiritual censures. In the same secret manner, he furnished them with a bull, to be made public if circumstances so required, by which Ro bert Bruce and his brother Edward were declared excommunicated persons.2 The Holy Father also di rected another bull against the order of Minorite Friars, who, by their discourses, had instigated the Irish to join the Scottish invaders, and rise in rebel lion against the English government. These at tempts to deprive him of his just rights, and to over awe him into peace, were met by a firm resistance on the part of Bruce, who, placed in a trying and delicate situation, evinced, in his opposition to the Papal interference, a remarkable union of unsha ken courage, with sound judgment and good temper, contriving to maintain the dignity and independence of his crown, whilst, at the same time, he professed all due respect for the authority of his Spiritual Father, as head of the church. Charged with their 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. iii. p. 594. s Dated 4th April, 1317."], [358, "1317. 342 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. important commissions, the cardinals arrived in Eng land at the time when Lewis de Beaumont was about to be consecrated Bishop of Durham. Their first step was to dispatch two nuncios, the Bishop of Cor beil and Master Aumery,1 who were intrusted with the delivery of the Papal letters to the Scottish King, and with the bulls of excommunication. As Dur ham lay on their road, Master Aumery and his bro ther nuncio set out with the bishop elect, and a splendid suite of church-men and barons, intending to be present at the inauguration. But it proved an ill-fated journey for these sleek sons of the Papacy. The borders at this time were in a wild and disorder ly state. Many of the gentry and barons, as already noticed, had entered into armed associations for the defence of the marches, against the dreadful and de structive inroads of the Scots ; but the habits of loose warfare, the extremities of famine, and the unpopu larity of the king's person and government, had, in the course of years, transformed themselves and their soldiers into robbers, who mercilessly ravaged the country.2 Anxious in every way to increase the confu sions which then distracted the English government, the King of Scotland kept up an intelligence with these marauders, and, on the present occasion, aware of the hostility which was meditated against him by the cardinals, and of their mercenary attachment to his enemy, he employed two leaders of these broken men, Gilbert de Middleton and Walter Selby, to inter- 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. iii. p. 661. 2 Walsingham, p. 107."], [359, "1317.

Accordingly, on the approach of the cavalcade to Rushy Ford, a large body of soldiers, headed by these lawless chiefs, rush ed out from a wood near the road, and in a short time made prisoners the whole party ; seized and stript of their purple and scarlet apparel the unfor tunate churchmen, rifled and carried off their luggage and horses ; but, without offering violence to their persons, dismissed them to prosecute their journey to Scotland. The bishop elect, and his brother Henry de Beaumont, were carried prisoners to Middleton's castle of Mitford ; nor were they liberated from their dungeon till their plate, jewels, and the rich vestments of the cathedral, were sold to raise money for their ransom.1 Meanwhile, the Papal nuncios, in sorry and disconsolate plight, proceeded into Scotland, and ar rived at court. Bruce received them courteously, and listened with attention to the message with which they were charged.2 Having then consulted with those of his counsellors who were present, upon the proposals, he replied, that he earnestly desired a firm peace between the kingdoms, to be procured by all honourable means ; but that as long as he was only addressed as Governor of Scotland, and his own title of King withheld from him, it was impossible for him, without convening his whole council, and the other barons of his realm, to admit the cardinal legates to 1 Tyrrel, Hist. vol. iii. p. 269.

These letters may possibly be addressed to them ; and it is for this reason, that al though I have permitted the Papal letters, which ad vise a peace, to be read, as well as your open letters on the same subject, yet to these, as they refuse to me my title of King, I will give no answer, nor will I by any means suffer your sealed letters, which are not directed to the King of Scotland, to be opened in my presence.\" 11 The nuncios upon this endeavoured to offer an apo logy for the omission, by observing, that it was not customary for our Holy Mother the Church either to do or to say anything during the dependence of a con troversy, which might prejudice the right of either of the parties. \" If then,\" replied Bruce, \" my Spiritual Father and my Holy Mother have professed them selves unwilling to create a prejudice against my op ponent, by giving to me the title of king, I am at a loss to determine why they have thought proper to prejudice my cause, by withdrawing that title from me during the dependence of the controversy. I am in possession of the kingdom. All my subjects call me king, and by that title do other kings and royal princes address me ; but I perceive that my spiritual parents assume an evident partiality amongst their sons. \u2014 Had you,\" he continued, \" presumed to pre-"], [361, "1317.

But I re verence your authority, and entertain all due respect for the Holy See.\" The messengers now requested that the king would command a temporary cessation of hostilities. \" To this,\" replied Bruce, \" I can by no means consent, without the advice of my parlia ment, and especially whilst the English are in the daily practice of spoiling the property of my subjects, aud invading all parts of my realm.\" During this interview, the king expressed himself with great cour tesy, professing all respect for his Spiritual Father, and delivering his resolute answers with a mild and placid countenance.1 The two nuncios, it seems, had taken along with them into the king's presence an other papal messenger, who, having come some time before to inform the Scottish prelates of the corona tion of the Pope, had been refused admission into Scotland. For this person, who had now waited some months without being permitted to execute his mis sion, the messengers entreated the king's indulgence ; but Bruce, although the unhappy envoy stood in the presence chamber, took no notice of him, and changed the subject with an expression of countenance, which at once imposed silence, and intimated a refusal. When the nuncios questioned the secretaries of the king regarding the cause of this severity, they at once replied, that their master conceived that these letters had not been addressed to him, solely because the Pope was unwilling to give him his royal titles. The 1 These interesting particulars we learn from the original letter of the nuncios themselves. Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. iii. p. 662."], [362, "346 1317. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Scottish councillors informed the nuncios, that if the letters had been addressed to the King of Scots, the negotiations for peace would have immediately com menced ; but that neither the king nor his advisers would hear of a treaty, so long as the royal title was withheld, seeing that they were convinced that this slight had been put upon their sovereign through the influence of England, and in contempt of the people of Scotland.1 Repulsed by Bruce with so much firmness and dig nity, the Bishop of Corbeil returned with haste to the cardinals. They had remained all this time at Dur ham, and ardent as true sons of the church to fulfil their mission, they now determined at all hazards to publish the Papal truce in Scotland. For this pur pose, the Papal bulls and instruments were intrusted to Adam Newton, the Father Guardian of the Mi norite Friars of Berwick, who was commanded to re pair to the presence of Bruce, and to deliver the let ters of his Holiness to the King of Scotland, as well as to the Bishop of St Andrews, and the Scottish prelates. Newton accordingly set out for Scotland, but, anticipating no cordial reception, cautiously left the Papal bulls and letters at Beriwck, until he should be assured of a safe conduct. After a journey of much hardship and peril, the friar found King Robert en camped, with his army, in a wood near Old Cam bus, a small town about twelve miles distant from Berwick, busily engaged in constructing warlike en gines for the assault of that city, although it was now 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. iii. p. 661."], [363, "1317. ROBERT BRUCE. 347 the middle of December. Having conferred with Lord Alexander Seton, the seneschal of the king, and received a safe conduct, Newton returned for his papers and credentials to Berwick, and again repaired to Old Cambus. He was then informed by Seton, that Bruce would not admit him to a personal inter view, but that he must deliver to him his letters, in order to their being inspected by the king, who was anxious to ascertain whether their contents were friendly or hostile. Newton obeyed, and Bruce, ob serving that the letters and Papal instruments were not addressed to him as King of Scotland, returned them to the friar with much contempt, declaring, that he would on no account obey the bulls, so long as his royal titles were withheld, and that he was determi ned to make himself master of Berwick. The envoy then publicly declared, before the Scottish barons and a great concourse of spectators, that a two years' truce was, by the authority of the Pope, to be observed by the two kingdoms ; but his proclamation was treated with such open marks of insolence and contempt, that he began to tremble for the safety of his person, and earnestly implored them to permit him to pass for ward into Scotland, to the presence of those prelates with whom he was commanded to confer, or at least to have a safe conduct back again to Berwick. Both requests were denied him, and he was commanded, without delay, to make the best of his way out of the country. On his way to Berwick, the unfortunate monk was way-laid by four armed ruffians, robbed of his letters and papers, amongst which were the bulls excommunicating the King of Scotland, and after"], [364, "1317. 348 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. being stript to the skin, turned naked upon the road. \" It is rumoured,\" says he, in a most interesting let ter addressed to the cardinals, containing the account of his mission, \" that the Lord Robert, and his ac complices, who instigated this outrage, are now in pos session of the letters intrusted to me.\" 1 There can be little doubt that the rumour rested on a pretty good foundation. Throughout the whole of this negotiation, the Pope was obviously the pliant tool of the King of England. Edward's intrigues at the Roman court, and the pen sions which he bestowed on the cardinals, induced his Holiness to proclaim a truce, which, in the present state of English affairs, was much to be desired ; but Bruce, supported by his own clergy, and secure of the affections of his people, despised all Papal interference, and succeeded in maintaining the dignity and inde pendence of his kingdom. Having rid himself of such troublesome opposition, the Scottish king determined to proceed with the siege of Berwick, a town which, as the key to England, was at this time fortified in the strongest manner. Fortu nately for the Scots, Edward had committed its de fence to a governor, whose severity, and strict adhe rence to discipline, had disgusted some of the burges ses ; and one of these, named Spalding,2 who had mar ried a Scotchwoman, was seduced from his allegiance, and agreed, on the night when it was his turn to take 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. iii. p. 682. 2 Harding, in his Chronicle, folio 171, tells us, that Spalding, after betraying the town, went into Scotland, and was slain by the Scots."], [365, "1318. ROBERT BRUCE. 349 his part in the watch rounds, to assist the enemy in an escalade. This purpose he communicated to the Earl of March, who, although long an adherent of Edward the First, had deserted his unpopular suc cessor, and the Earl carried the intelligence directly to Bruce himself, who was not slow in taking ad vantage of it. Douglas and Randolph, along with March, were commanded to assemble with a chosen body of men at Duns Park in the evening ; and at night-fall, having left their horses at the rendez vous, they marched to Berwick, and, by the assist ance of Spalding, fixed their ladders, and scaled the walls. Orders seem to have been given by Bruce, that they should not proceed to storm the town, till reinforced by a stronger body ; but Douglas and Randolph found it impossible to restrain their men, who dispersed themselves through the streets, to slay and plunder, whilst, panic-struck with the night attack, the citizens escaped over the walls, or threw themselves into the castle. When day arrived, this disobedience of orders had nearly been fatal to the Scots ; for Roger Horsley, the governor of the castle,1 discovering that they were but a handful of men, 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, 2 Edward II. 19th August.

Douglas, however, and Randolph, who were veterans in war, and dreaded such an event, had kept their own soldiers pretty well together, and assisted by a young knight, Sir William Keith of Galston, who greatly distinguished himself, they at last succeeded in driving the English back to the castle ; thus hold ing good their conquest of the town, till Bruce came up with the rest of his army, and effectually secured it. The presence of the king with the men of the Merse and Teviotdale, intimidated the garrison of the castle, which soon surrendered ; and Bruce, with that generous magnanimity which forms so fine a part of his character, disdaining to imitate the cruelty of Ed ward the First, readily gave quarter to all who were willing to accept it. For this we have the testimony of the English historians, Thomas de la More, and Adam Murimuth, although the Pope, in his bull ex communicating Bruce, represents him as having seized Berwick by treachery during a time of truce, and charges him, moreover, with having committed a great and cruel slaughter of the inhabitants. Both accusa tions are completely false.1 The truce was publicly disclaimed by the king, and the city was treated with uncommon lenity. It was at this time the chief com mercial emporium of England, aud its plunder greatly enriched the Scottish army. There was also found in it great quantities of provisions and military stores, and Bruce, after having examined the fortifications, 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. iii. pp. 708, 709."], [367, "1318. 351 ROBERT BRUCE. determined to make it an exception from his general rule of demolishing all fortresses recovered from the English. In execution of this plan, he committed the keeping of both town and castle to his gallant son-in law, Walter the Steward ; and aware, that from its great strength and importance, the English would soon attempt to recover it, he provided it with every sort of warlike engine then used in the defence of for tified places. Springalds and cranes, with huge ma chines for discharging iron darts, called balist\u00e6 de turno, were stationed on the walls ; a large body of archers, spearmen, and cross-bowmen, formed the gar rison ; and the young Steward was assisted in his measures of defence by John Crab, a Fleming, fa mous for his skill in the rude engineering of the times.1 Five hundred brave gentlemen, who quar tered the arms of the Steward, repaired to Berwick, to the support of their chief; and Bruce, having left it victualled for a year, marched with his army into England, and ravaged and laid waste the coun try. He besieged and made himself master of the castles of Wark and Harbottle, surprised Mitford, and having penetrated into Yorkshire, burnt the towns of Northallerton, Boroughbridge, Scarborough, and Skipton in Craven. The plunder in these ex- 1 Barbour, pp. 339, 340. Crab seems to have been a mercenary who engaged in the service of any who would employ him.

Meanwhile, the death of King Edward Bruce in Ireland, and of Marjory, the king's daughter, who left an only son, Robert, afterwards king, rendered some new enactments ne cessary regarding the succession to the throne. A parliament was accordingly assembled at Scone in December, in which the whole clergy and laity re newed their engagements of obedience to the king, and promised to assist him faithfully, to the utmost of their power, in the preservation and defence of the rights and liberties of the kingdom, against all per sons, of whatever strength, power, and dignity, they may be ; and any one who should attempt to violate this engagement and ordinance, was declared guilty of treason. It was next enacted, that, in the event of the king's death, without issue male, Robert Stewart, son of the Princess Marjory aud of Walter, the Lord 1 Chron.

It was moreover decla- red, that since, in certain times past, some doubts had arisen regarding the succession of the kingdom of Scotland, the parliament thought proper to express their opinion, that this succession ought not to have been regulated, and henceforth should not be deter- mined, by the rules of inferior fees and inheritances, but that the male heir nearest to the king, in the di- rect line of descent, should succeed to the crown ; and failing him, the nearest female in the direct line ; and failing the whole direct line, the nearest male heir in the collateral line \u2014 respect being always had to the right of blood by which the last king reigned, which seemed agreeable to the imperial law.1 This enactment having been unanimously agreed to, Randolph and Douglas came forward, and, after accepting the offices provisionally conferred upon them, swore, with their hands on the holy Gospels and the re lics of the saints, faithfully and diligently to discharge 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 290, VOL. I. Z"], [370, "1318. 354 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. their duty, and to observe, and cause to be observed, the laws and customs of Scotland. After this, the bishops, abbots, priors, and inferior clergy, and the earls, barons, knights, and freeholders, in the same solemn manner took the same oath, and those of the highest rank affixed their seals to the instrument of succession.1 Having settled this important matter, various other laws were passed, relative to the military power, and to the ecclesiastical and civil government of the kingdom. All men were required to array themselves for war. Every layman possessed of land who had ten pounds worth of movable property, was commanded to provide himself with an acton and a basnet, that is a leathern jacket, and a steel helmet, together with gloves of plate, and a sword and spear. Those who were not thus provided, were enjoined to have an iron jack, or back and breast-plate of iron, an iron head-piece, or knapiskay, with gloves of plate ; and every man possessing the value of a cow, was com manded to arm himself with a bow and a sheaf of twenty-four arrows, or with a spear.2 It was made imperative upon all sheriffs and lords to make inquest into the execution of this law ; and in case of disobe dience, to cause the recusant to forfeit his movable estate, half to the king, and half to his overlord, or superior. All persons, while on the road to the royal army, were commanded to subsist at their own charges; those who came from places near the rendezvous be ing commanded to bring carriages and provisions along 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. i. p. 291.

All persons were strictly prohibited from supplying the enemy with armour or horses, bows and arrows, or any kind of weapons, or to give to the English assistance in any shape what ever, and this under the penalty of being guilty of a capital offence. All ecclesiastics were prohibited from remitting to the Papal Court any sums of money for the purchase of bulls ; and all Scotsmen, who, although possessed of estates in their own country, chose to re side in England, were prohibited from drawing any money out of Scotland, \u2014 a clause apparently directed against David de Strabogie, Earl of Athol, who at this time stood high in the confidence of Edward the Second.1 This weak monarch, when he found that Bruce could not be brought to terms by negotiation, or inti midated by the Papal thunders, determined once more to have recourse to arms ; and having assembled an army, he crossed the Tweed, and sat down before Ber wick. His first precaution was to secure his camp by strong lines of circumvallation, composed of high ram parts and deep trenches, so as to enable him to resist effectually any attempt of the Scots to raise the siege. He then strictly invested the town from the Tweed to the sea, and at the same time the English fleet entered the estuary of the river, so that the city was Regiam Majestatem. Stat. Robert I."], [372, "356 1319- HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. beleaguered on all points. This was in the beginning of September, and from the strength of the army and the quality of the leaders much was expected. The first assault was made on the seventh of the month ; it had been preceded by great preparations. Mounds of earth had been erected against that part of the walls, where, it was expected, there would be the greatest facility in storming. Early on the morn ing of St Mary's Eve, the trumpets of the English were heard, and the besiegers advanced in various bodies, well provided with scaling ladders, scaffolds, and defences, with hoes and pick-axes for mining. and under cover of squadrons of archers and slingers. The assault soon became general, and continued with various success till noon ; at which time the English ships entered the river, aud, sailing up as far as the tide permitted, made a daring attempt to carry the town, from the rigging of a vessel which they had pre pared for the purpose. The topmasts of this vessel, and her boat, which was drawn up half-mast high, were manned with soldiers, and to the bow of the boat was fitted a species of draw-bridge, which was intended to be dropt upon the wall, and to afford a passage from the ship into the town. The walls themselves, which were not more than a spear's length in height, afforded little defence against these serious preparations ; but the Scots, animated by that feeling of national superio rity which a long train of success had inspired, and en couraged by the presence and example of the Steward, effectually repulsed the enemy on the land side, whilst thc ship, which had struck upon a bank, was left dry"], [373, "1319. ROBERT BRUCE. 357 by the ebbing of the tide ; and being attacked by a party of the Scots, was soon seen blazing in the mouth of the river. Disheartened by this double failure, the besiegers drew off their forces, and for the pre sent, intermitted all attack.1 But it was only to commence new preparations for a more desperate as sault. In case of a second failure in their escalade, it was determined to undermine the walls ; and for this purpose, a huge machine was constructed, covered from attack by a strong roofing of boards and hides, and holding within its bosom large bodies of armed soldiers and miners. From its shape and covering, this formidable engine was called a sow. To co-operate with this machine, movable scaffolds, high enough to overtop the walls, and capable of receiving large bodies of armed men, were erected for the attack ; and undismayed at his first failure by sea, Edward commanded a number of ships to be fitted out similar to that vessel which had been burnt ; but with this difference, that in addition to the armed boats, slung half-mast high, their top castles were full of archers, under whose incessant and deadly discharge it was expected that the assailants would drag the ships so near the walls, as to be able to fix their movable bridges on the capstone.2 Meanwhile the Scots were not idle. Under the direction of Crab, the Flemish engineer, they constructed two machines of great strength, and similar to the Roman catapult, which moved on frames, fitted with wheels, and by which stones of a large size were propelled with steady aim Barbour, pp. 345, 346. 2 Ibid. pp. 351, 352"], [374, "358 1319. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. and immense strength. Espringalds were stationed on the walls, which were smaller engines, analogous to the ancient balista, and calculated for the projec tion of thick and heavy darts, winged with copper ; strong iron chains, with grappling hooks attached to them, and piles of fire faggots, mixed with bundles of pitch and flax, and bound into large masses, sha ped like casks, were in readiness ; and to second the ingenuity of Crab, an English engineer, of great skill, who had been taken prisoner in the first assault, was compelled, under pain of death, to assist in the de fence. The young Steward assigned, as before, to each of his officers a certain post on the circuit of the walls, and put himself at the head of a chosen reserve, with which he determined to watch, and, if necessary, to reinforce the various points of attack. Having made these judicious arrangements, he calmly awaited the attack of the English, which was made with great fury early in the morning of the 13th of September. To the sound of trumpet and war-horns, the various divisions of the English moved resolutely forward ; and, in spite of all discharges from the walls, succeeded in filling up the ditch, and fixing their ladders ; but after a conflict, which lasted from sunrise till noon, they found it impossible to overcome the determined gallantry of the Scots, and were fairly beaten back on every quarter. At this moment the King of England ordered the sow to be advanced ; and the English, aware that if they allowed the Scottish engineers time to take a correct aim, a single stone from the catapult would be fatal, dragged it on with great eagerness. Twice was the aim taken, and twice it failed. The"], [375, "1319- ROBERT BRUCE. 359 first stone flew over the machine, the second fell short of it ; the third, an immense mass, which passed through the air with a loud booming noise, hit it di rectly in the middle with a dreadful crash, and shi vered its strong roof-timbers into a thousand pieces. Such of the miners and soldiers who escaped death, rushed out from amongst the fragments ; and the Scots, raising a shout, cried out that the English sow had farrowed her pigs.1 Crab, the engineer, immedi ately cast his chains and grappling hooks over the unwieldy machine, and having effectually prevented its removal, poured down burning faggots upon its broken timbers, and soon consumed it to ashes. Nor were the English more fortunate in their attack upon the side of the river. Their ships, indeed, moved up to wards the walls at floodtide, but whether from the shal lowness of the water, or the faintheartedness of their leaders, the attack entirely failed. One of them which led the way, on coming within range of the catapult, was struck by a large stone, which damaged the ves sel, and killed and mangled some of the crew ; upon which the remaining ships, intimidated by the acci dent, drew off from the assault. A last effort of the besiegers, in which they endeavoured to set fire to St Mary's gate, was bravely repulsed by the Steward in person ; and at nightfall, the English army, foiled on every side, and greatly disheartened, entirely with drew from the assault.2 The spirit with which the defence was carried on, may be estimated from the circumstance, that the 1 Barbour, p. 354. - Ibid. p. 357."], [376, "360 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1319. women and boys in the town, during the hottest sea son of the assault, supplied the soldiers on the walls with bundles of arrows, and stones for the engines. Although twice beaten off- it was yet likely that the importance of gaining Berwick would have induced the King of England to attempt a third attack, but Bruce determined to raise the siege by making a powerful diversion, and directed Randolph aud Dou glas, at the head of an army of fifteen thousand men, to invade England. During the presence of her hus band at the siege of Berwick, the Queen of England had taken up her quarters near York, and it was the daring plan of these two veteran warriors, by a rapid and sudden march through the heart of Yorkshire, to seize the person of the queen, and, with this precious captive in their hands, to dictate the terms of peace to her husband.1 Bruce, who, in addition to his great talents in the field, had not neglected to avail himself in every way of Edward's extreme unpopularity, ap pears to have established a secret correspondence, not only with the Earl of Lancaster, who was then along with his master before Berwick, but with others about the queen's person.2 The plan had very nearly been successful ; but a Scottish prisoner, who fell into the hands of the Euglish, gave warning of the meditated attack, and Randolph, on penetrating to York, found the prey escaped, and the court removed to a distance. Incensed at this disappointment, they ravaged the 1 \" Certe si capta fuisset tune Regina, credo quod pacem emisset sibi Scocia.\" \u2014 M.

The military strength of the country was then before Berwick, and nothing remained but the forces of the church, and of the vassals who held lands by military service to the Archiepiscopal See. These were hastily assembled by William de Melton, the Archbishop of York, and the Bishop of Ely,1 and a force of twenty thousand men, but of a very motley description, pro- ceeded to intercept the Scots. Multitudes of priests and monks, whose shaved crowns suited ill with the steel basnet, \u2014 great bodies of the feudal militia of the church, but hastily levied, and imperfectly discipli- ned, \u2014 the mayor of York, with his train-bands and armed burgesses, composed the army which the arch- bishop, emulous, perhaps, of the fame which had been acquired in the battle of the Standard, by his predecessor Thurstan, too rashly determined to lead against the veteran soldiers of Randolph and Dou- glas. The result was exactly what might have been expected. The Scots were encamped at Mitton, near the small river Swale. Across the stream there was then a bridge, over which the English army defiled. Whilst thus occupied, some large stacks of hay were set on fire by the Scots,2 and, under cover of a dense mass of smoke which rose between them and the enemy, a strong column of men threw themselves be- 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. p. 202. 4th Sept. 13 Ed. II. J Harding's Chronicle, pp. 172, 173."], [378, "362 1319. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. tween the English army and the bridge. As the smoke cleared away, the English found themselves attacked with great fury both in front and rear, by the fatal long spear of the Scottish infantry ; and the army of. the archbishop was in a few moments en tirely broken and dispersed.1 In an incredibly short time, four thousand of the English were slain, and amongst these many priests, whose white surplices co vered their armour. Great multitudes were drowned in attempting to recross the river, and it seems to have been fortunate for the English that the battle was fought in the evening, and that a September night soon closed upon the field ; for had it been a morning attack, it is probable that Randolph aud Douglas would have put the whole army to the sword. Three hundred ecclesiastics fell in this battle ; from which circumstance, and in allusion to the prelates who led the army, it was denominated, in the rude pleasantry of the times, \" The Chapter of Mitton.\" When the news of the disaster reached the camp before Berwick, the troops began to murmur, and the Earl of Lancas ter, soon after, in a fit of disgust, deserted the leaguer with his whole followers, composing nearly a third part of the army.2 Edward immediately raised the siege, and made a spirited effort to intercept Douglas and Randolph on their return, and compel them to fight at a disadvantage ; but he had to deal with experi enced soldiers, whose secret information was accurate, and who were intimately acquainted with the Border 1 I. de Trokelowe, p. 45.

While he attempted to intercept them by one road, they had already taken another, and leaving their route to be traced as their advance had been, by the flames and smoke of villages and hamlets, they return ed without experiencing a single check, into Scotland, loaded with booty, and confirmed in their feeling of military superiority. It may give some idea of the dreadful and far-spreading devastation occasioned by this and similar inroads of the Scottish army, when it is stated, that in an authentic document in the F\u0153 dera Angli\u00e6, it appears that eighty-four towns and villages were burnt and pillaged by the army of Ran dolph and Douglas in this expedition. These, on ac count of the great losses sustained, are, by a royal let ter addressed to the tax-gatherers of the West Riding of Yorkshire, expressly exempted from all contribu tion ; x and in this list the private castles and ham lets which were destroyed in the same fiery inroad, do not appear to be included. Bruce could not fail to be particularly gratified by these successes. Berwick, not only the richest com mercial town in England, but of extreme importance as a key to that country, remained in his hands, after a siege by an overwhelming army led by the King of England in person ; and the young warrior, who had so bravely repulsed the enemy, was the Steward of Scotland, the husband of his only daughter, on whom the hopes and wishes of the nation mainly rested. The defeat upon the Swale was equally destructive 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. iii. pp. 801, 802."], [380, "364 1319 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. and decisive, and it was followed up by another ex pedition of the restless and indefatigable Douglas, who, about All-Hallow tide of the same year, when the northern borders had gathered in their harvest, broke into and burnt Gilsland and the surrounding country, ravaged Borough-on-Stanmore, and came sweeping home through Westmoreland and Cumber land, driving his cattle and his prisoners before him, and cruelly adding to the miseries of the recent fa mine, by a total destruction of the agricultural pro duce, which had been laid up for the winter.1 It was a remarkable part of the character of Bruce, and one which marked his great abilities, that he knew as well when to make peace as to pursue war ; and that, after any great success, he could select the moment best fitted for permanently securing to his kingdom the advantages, which, had he reduced his enemy to extremity, might have eluded his grasp. The natural consequence of a long series of defeats sustained by Edward, was an anxious desire upon his own part, and that of his parliament, for a truce between the kingdoms ;* and as the Scots were satiated with 1 Hume's Douglas and Angus, vol. i. p. 70. 5 Walsingham. \" Igitur Rex, sentiens quotidie sua damna cumu lari, de communi consilio in treugas jurat biennales, Scotis libenter has acceptantibus, non tamen quia jam fuerant bellis fatigati, sed quia fuerant Anglica pr\u00e6da ditati.\" Lingard says nothing of the request of the parliament, that Edward would enter into a truce with the Scots, but observes, that the first proposal for a negotia tion came from Scotland, and that the demand for the regal title was waved by Bruce. The truce itself is not published in Rymer, so that there is no certain proof that Bruce waved the regal title ;"], [381, "1319. 365 ROBERT BRUCE. victory, and, to use the words of an English historian, so enriched by the plunder of England that that coun try could scarcely afford them more, Bruce lent a ready ear to the representations of the English commis sioners, and agreed to a truce for two years between the kingdoms, to commence from Christmas 1319. Conservators of the truce were appointed by Eng land,1 and, in the meantime, commissioners of both nations were directed to continue their conferences, with the hope of concluding a final peace. One great object of Bruce in consenting to a ces sation of hostilities, was his desire to be reconciled to the Roman See, a desire which apparently was very far from its accomplishment. His Holiness, instead of acting as a peace-maker, seized this moment to rei terate his spiritual censures against the King of Scot land and his adherents, in a bull of great length, and unexampled rancour ;2 and some time after the final settlement of the truce, the Archbishop of York, with the Bishops of London and Carlisle, were command ed by the Pope, \u2014 and the order is stated to have pro ceeded jm information communicated by Edward, \u2014 to and although, in the'document in Rymer, vol. iii. p. 806, Edward, in a letter to the Pope, states, that Bruce made proposals for a truce, the evidence is not conclusive, as Edward, in his public pa pers, did not scruple to conceal his disasters, by assuming a tone of superiority, when his affairs were at the lowest ebb. 1 This is the first instance of the appointment of conservators of truce'for the Borders.

To him are we bound, both by his own merit and by the law of the land, and to him, as the saviour of our people, and the guardian of our liberty, are we unanimously determined to adhere ; but if he should desist from what he has begun, and should show an inclination to subject us or our kingdom to the King of England, or to his people, then we de clare, that we will use our utmost effort to expel him from the throne, as our enemy, and the subverter of his own and of our right, aud we will choose another king to rule over us, who will be able to defend us ;"], [384, "368 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1320. for as long as a hundred Scotsmen are left alive, we will never be subject to the dominion of England. It is not for glory, riches, or honour, that we fight, but for that liberty which no good man will consent to lose but with his life. \" Wherefore, most reverend Father, we humbly pray, and from our hearts beseech your Holiness to consider, that you are the vicegerent of Him with whom there is no respect of persons, Jews or Greeks, Scots or English ; and turning your paternal regard upon the tribulations brought upon us and the church of God by the English, to admonish the King of England that he should be content with what he pos sesses, seeing that England of old was enough for seven, or more kings, and not to disturb our peace in this small country, lying on the utmost boundaries of the habitable earth, and whose inhabitants desire no thing but what is their own.\" The barons proceed to say, that they are willing to do everything for peace which may not compromise the freedom of their constitution and government ; and they exhort the Pope to procure the peace of Christendom, in order to the removal of all impedi ments in the way of a crusade against the infidels ; de claring the readiness with which both they and their king would undertake that sacred warfare, if the King of England would cease to disturb them.

Confident that we now are, and shall ever, as in duty bound, remain obedient sons to you, as God's vicegerent, we commit the defence of our cause to that God, as the great King and Judge, placing our confidence in him, and in the firm hope that he will eudow us with strength, and confound our enemies ; and may the Almighty long preserve your Holiness in health.\" This memorable letter is dated at Aberbrothock, on the 6th of April 1320, and it is signed by eight earls and thirty-one barons, amongst whom we find the great officers, the high steward, the seneschal, the constable, and the marshal, with the barons, free holders, and whole community of Scotland.1 The effect of such a remonstrance, and the nego tiations of Sir Edward Mabuisson and Sir Adam de Gordon, two special messengers, who were sent by Bruce to the Papal court, induced his Holiness to de lay for some time the reiterated publication of the Pa pal processes, and earnestly to recommend a peace be tween the two countries. For this purpose, a meeting took place between certain Scottish and English com missioners, which was attended by two envoys from 1 A sac-simile of this famous letter was engraved by Anderson, in his Diplomata Scoti\u00e6, Plate 51.

But Edward was not yet sufficiently humbled to con sent to the conditions stipulated by his antagonist, and Bruce was the less anxious to come to an agree ment, as a dangerous civil insurrection, headed by the Earl of Lancaster, his secret friend and ally, had just broke out in England, and promised to give Edward full employment at home.1 In the midst of these unsuccessful negotiations for peace, a conspiracy of an alarming and mysterious na ture against the life of the King of Scots was disco vered, by the confession of the Countess of Strathern, who was privy to the plot. William de Soulis, the seneschal, or high butler of Scotland, Sir David de Brechin, nephew to the king, an accomplished knight, who had signalized himself in the Holy War, five other knights, Sir Gilbert de Malherbe, Sir John Logie, Sir Eustace de Maxwell, Sir Walter de Berklay, and Sir Patrick de Graham, with three esquires, Richard Brown, Hameline de Troupe, and Eustace de Rat tray, are the only persons whose names have come down to us as certainly implicated in the conspiracy. Of these, Sir David de Brechin, along with Malherbe, Logie, and Brown, suffered the punishment of trea son.2 The destruction of all record of their trial renders it difficult to throw any light on the minute details of the conspiracy ; but we have the evidence 1 Rymer's F\u0153dera, vol. iii. pp. 866, 884.

In the case of Brechin, we find him enjoying special letters of protection from Edward. In addition to these he was pensioned in 1312, was appointed English warden of the town and castle of Dundee, aud employed in secret and confidential com munications, having for their object the destruction of his uncle's power in Scotland, and the triumph of the English arms over his native country. It is certain that he was a prisoner of war in Scotland in the year 1315,2 having probably been taken in arms at the battle of Bannockburn. In the five years of glory and success which followed, and in the repeated expe ditions of Randolph and Douglas, we do not once meet with his name ; and now, after having been received into favour, he became connected with, or at least connived at a conspiracy, which involved the death of the king. Such a delinquent is little entitled to our sympathy.

The parliament in which these trials and condemnations took place, was held at Scone in the beginning of August 1320, and long remembered in Scotland under the name of the Black Parlia ment.2 A brief gleam of success now cheered the prospects of Edward, and encouraged him to continue the war with Scotland. The Earl of Lancaster, who, along with the Earl of Hereford and other English barons, had entered into a strict treaty of alliance with Bruce, and concerted an invasion of England, to be conduct ed by the King of Scotland in person,3 was defeated and taken prisoner by Sir Andrew Hartcla and Sir Simon Ward, near Pontefract ; his army was totally routed, and he himself soon after executed for treason. 1 Barbour, pp. 381, 382. 2 Hailes, in many parts of his Annals, shows a singular love of white-washing dubious characters. He laments over Brechin, and creates an impression in the reader's mind, that Bruce was unneces sarily rigorous, and might have pardoned him ; yet his case, instead of being favourable, as represented by the historian, was peculiarly aggravated. Bruce's generous nature had passed over manifold at tempts by Brechin against the liberty of his country.

In the battle the Earl of Hereford was slain, many others of the discontented nobility shared the fate of Lancaster, and the dangerous faction which had for so many years been a thorn in the side of the king, was entirely broken and put down. Exulting at this success, Edward determined to collect an army which should at once enable him to put an end to the war, and in a tone of premature triumph, wrote to the Pope, \" requesting him to give himself no far ther trouble about a truce with the Scots, as he had determined to establish a peace by force of arms.\"1 In furtherance of this resolution, he proceeded to issue his writs for the attendance of his military vassals ; but so ill were these obeyed, that four months were lost before the army assembled, and in this interval the Scots, with their usual strength and fury, broke into England, led by the king in person, wasted with fire and sword the six northern counties which had scarcely drawn breath from a visitation of the same kind by Randolph, and returned to Scotland, (we use the words of the English historian Knighton,) loaded with an immense booty, consisting of herds of sheep and oxen, quantities of gold and silver, ecclesi astical plate and ornaments, jewels, and table equi page, which they piled in waggons, and drove off at their pleasure.2 Meanwhile Edward continued his preparations, which, although dilatory, were on a great 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. iii. p. 944. = Knighton, p. 2542.

A parliament held at York, in the end of July, grant ed large subsidies from the nobles and the clergy, the cities, towns, and burghs ; a fleet of transports with provisions, was sent round to enter the Forth, and an offensive squadron, under the command of Sir John Leybourn, was fitted out for the attack of the west coast and the islands. All things being ready, Ed ward invaded Scotland at the head of an army of a hundred thousand men ;' but the result of the expe dition wasjamentably disproportionate to the magni tude of his promises and his preparations, and mani fested in a very striking manner the superior talents and policy of Bruce. No longer bound, as at Bannockburn, by the rash engagement of his brother to risk his kingdom upon the fate of a battle, which he must have fought with a greatly disproportionate force, the king determined to make the numbers of the English army the cause of their ruin, \u2014 to starve them in an enemy's country, and then to fall upon them when, enfeebled by want, they could offer little resistance.

The cattle and the sheep, the stores of corn and victuals, aud the valuable effects of every kind, through out the districts of the Merse, Teviotdale, and the Lothians, had entirely disappeared ; the warlike popu lation, which were expected to debate the advance of the army, had retired under the command of the King of Scotland to Culross, on the north side of the Firth of Forth, and Edward, having in vain waited for sup plies by his fleet, which contrary winds prevented en tering the Firth, was compelled by famine to give orders for a retreat.1 The moment the English be gan their march homewards, the Scots commenced the fatal partizan warfare in which Douglas and Ran dolph were such adepts, hung upon their rear, cutting off the stragglers, and ready to improve every advan tage. An advanced party of three hundred strong, were put to the sword by Douglas at Melrose, but the main army, coming up, plundered and destroyed this ancient monastery, spoiled the high altar of its holiest vessels, sacrilegiously casting out the consecrated host, and cruelly murdering the prior, and some blind feeble monks, who, from affection or bodily infirmity, had re fused to fly.2 Turning off by Dryburgh, the disap pointed invaders left this monastery in flames, and hastening through Teviotdale, were overjoyed once more to find themselves surrounded by the plenty and 1 Barbour, p. 370. - Fordun a Hearne, p. 101 1."], [392, "1322. 376 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. comfort of their own country. Yet here a new cala mity awaited them ; for the scarcity and famine of an unsuccessful invasion induced the soldiers to give themselves up to unlimited indulgence, and they were soon attacked by a mortal dysentery, which rapidly carried off immense numbers, and put a finishing stroke to this unhappy expedition, by the loss of six teen thousand men.1 But Edward was destined to experience still more unhappy reverses. Having collected the scattered remains of his great army, and strengthened it by fresh levies, he encamped at Biland Abbey, near Malton, in Yorkshire ; and when there, was met by the grateful intelligence, that King Robert, having sat down before Norham Castle with a powerful ar my, after some time fruitlessly spent in the siege, had been compelled to retire. Scarce, however, had this good news arrived, when the advanced parties of the Scottish army were descried ; and the English had only time to secure a strong position on the ridge of a hill, before Robert was marching through the plain with his whole forces, and it became manifest that he meant to attack the English. This, however, from the nature of the ground, was no easy matter. Their soldiers were drawn up along the ridge of a rugged and steep declivity, which was assailable only by a single narrow pass, which led to Biland Abbey. This pass, Sir James Douglas, with a chosen body of men, undertook to force ; and as he advanced his banner, 1 Knighton, p. 2542. Barbour, 373, 374. Fordun a Hearne, p. 1012."], [393, "1322. ROBERT BRUCE. 377 and the pennons of his knights and squires were mar shalling and waving round him, his friend and bro ther in arms, the illustrious Randolph, with four squires, came up and joined the enterprise as a volun teer. The Scottish soldiers attacked the enemy with the utmost resolution ; but they were received with equal bravery by Sir Thomas Ugh tred1 and Sir Ralph Cobham, who fought iu advance of the column which defended the pass, and encouraged their men to a desperate resistance. Meanwhile, stones and other missiles were poured down from the high ground in occupation of the English ; and this double attack, with the narrowness of the pass, caused the battle to be exceeding obstinate and bloody. Bruce, whose eye intently watched every circumstance, determined now to repeat the man\u0153uvre, by which, many years before, he entirely defeated the army of the Lord of the Isles, when it occupied ground very similar to the present position of the English. He commanded the men of Argyle and the Isles to climb the rocky ridge, at some distance from the pass, and to attack and turn the flank of the English, who held the summit. These orders the mountaineers, trained in their own country to this species of warfare, found no difficulty 1 Ker, in his History of Bruce, vol. ii. p. 284, following Pinker ton, makes the name Enchter.

So rapid had been the succession of these events, that the English king, confident in the strength of his position, could scarcely trust his eyes, when he saw his army entirely routed, and flying in all di rections ; himself compelled to abandon his camp equi page, baggage, and treasure to the enemy, and to consult his safety by a precipitate flight, pursued by the young Steward of Scotland, at the head of five hundred horse. The king with difficulty escaped to Bridlington, having lost the privy seal in the confu sion of the day.2 This is the second time during this weak and inglorious reign, that the privy seal of Eng land was lost amid the precipitancy of the king's flight from the face of his enemies.

Richmond was treated by the king with unusual severity, com manded into strict confinement, and only liberated after a long captivity, and at the expense of an enor mous ransom. The cause of this is said to have been the terms of slight and opprobrium with which he had 1 Barbour, p. 376. 2 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. iii. p. 977. 3 Ridpath, p. 272.

They did so accordingly ; and after some time, on setting out for France, were dismissed, not only free of ransom, but enriched with presents.2 Af- ter this decisive defeat, the Scots plundered the whole country to the north of the Humber, and extended their destructive ravages to Beverley, laying waste the East Riding with fire and sword, and levying, from the towns and monasteries, which were rich enough to pay for their escape from plunder, very large sums of redemption money.3 The clergy and inhabitants of Beverley purchased their safety at the rate of four hundred pounds, being six thousand pounds of our present money. Loaded with booty, driving large herds of cattle before them, and rich in multitudes of captives, both of low and high degree, the Scottish army at length returned to their own country.4 1 Barbour, p. 378. 2 Ibid. 3 Ker's Bruce, vol. ii. p. 287. 4 Dr Lingard (vol. iii. p. 442) following the authority of John de Trokelowe, p. 64, has represented the battle of Biland Abbey as a skirmish, in which, after Edward had disbanded his army,"], [396, "380 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1322. The councils of the King of England continued after this to be distracted by treachery and dissen sion amongst his nobility. Hartcla, who, for his good service, in the destruction of the Lancastrian faction, had been created Earl of Carlisle, soon after, imita ting the example of Lancaster, entered into a cor respondence with Bruce, and organized a very exten sive confederacy amongst the northern barons, which had for its object, not only to conclude a truce with the Scots, independent of any communication with the king, but to maintain Robert Bruce and his heirs in the right and possession of the entire kingdom of Scotland. On the discovery of the plot, he suffered the death of a traitor, after being degraded from his new honours, and having his gilt spurs hacked off his heels.1 Henry de Beaumont, one of the king's councillors, was soon after this disgraced, and com mitted to the custody of the marshal, on refusing to give his advice, in terms of great insolence and auda- Bruce surprised the English king and the knights who were with him. Had he given the account of Barbour, or Fordun, or of Lord Hailes, whom he has elsewhere too scrupulously followed, he would have expressed himself very differently. The impression left upon the mind of the general reader, by Lingard's narrative, is, that the king, after disbanding his army, and when residing in security near York, with his knights, was surprised and nearly taken by the Scots. In this mode of telling the story, the determined resistance made by the English army, the storming of their encamp ment, the strong ground in which it was placed, and, indeed, tha circumstance that there was an army at all with the king, is omit ted. 1 Ker's Hist, of Bruce, p. 289, vol. ii.

Nor was Bruce unwilling to entertain pacific overtures. He repelled, indeed, with becoming dig nity, a weak attempt to refuse to acknowledge him as the principal leader and party in the truce,2 and insisted on his recognition as chief of his Scottish subjects ; but he consented, by the mediation of his friend, Henry de Sully, to a thirteen years' truce. This truce, however, he ratified under the style and title of King of Scotland, and this ratification Ed ward agreed to accept.\" But although desirous of peace, the conduct of the English monarch at this time was marked by dissimulation and bad faith. While apparently anxious for a truce, he employed his ambassadors at the Papal court to irritate the Holy Father against Bruce, and to fan the dissen sions between them ; he summoned an array of the whole military service of England during the ne gotiations, and he recalled Edward Baliol, the son of the late King of Scots, from his castle in Nor mandy, to reside at the English court.4 To coun teract these intrigues of England, Bruce dispatched his nephew, Randolph, to the Papal court; and 1 Rymer's F\u0153dera, vol. iii. p. 1021. 2 Hailes' Annals, vol. ii. p. 108.

Flattered by the judicious declarations of his master's devotion to the Holy See, soothed by the expression of his anxiety for a peace with England, and an entire reconcilia tion with the Catholic Church, and delighted with the ardour with which Bruce declared himself ready to repair in person to the Holy War, the Pontiff consented, under the influence of these feelings, to remove all cause of quarrel, by addressing a bull to Bruce, with the title of king.1 It has been justly ob served, that the conduct of this delicate negotiation presents to us this great warrior in the new character of a consummate politician.2 Against this unexpect ed and capricious conduct of the Pope, Edward en tered a spirited remonstrance, complaining, with great show of reason, that although the Pope maintained that Bruce's claim could not be strengthened, nor that of the King of England impaired, by his be stowing on his adversary the title of king, yet the people of Scotland would naturally conclude that his Holiness intended to acknowledge the right where he had given the title ;3 and he reminded him, that it was against an established maxim of Papal policy, that any alteration in the condition of the parties should be made during the continuance of the truce. During these negotiations with the Papal court, a 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. iv. p. 29. 2 Hailes, vol. ii. 4to, p. 113. 3 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. iv. p. 46."], [399, "1323.

It was an event of great joy to the country, and the court poets of the day foretold, that, like his illustrious father, the royal infant would prove a man strong in arms, \" who would regale himself amid the gardens of Eng land,\" a compliment, unfortunately, not destined to be prophetic.2 Meanwhile, the negotiations for a last ing peace between the two kingdoms proceeded ; but the demands made by the Scottish commissioners were considered to be too degrading to be consented to by England, even in her present feeble and disorder ed state. The negotiations were tedious and compli cated, but their particulars do not appear in the state papers of the time. If we may believe an ancient English historian,3 it was insisted, that all demand of feudal superiority was for ever to be renounced by England ; the fatal stone of Scone, as well as certain manors in England, belonging to the King of Scots, which had been seized by Edward the First, were to be delivered to their rightful owners. A marriage be tween the royal blood of England and Scotland was to guarantee a lasting peace between the two king doms ; and, finally, the whole of the north of Eng land, as far as to the gates of the city of York, was to be ceded to Scotland.

As soon, indeed, as Bruce became assured of the in sidious and discreditable conduct of Edward, in con tinuing his machinations at the Papal court, for the purpose of preventing the promised grant of absolu tion to him and to his people, it was natural that all thoughts of a cordial reconciliation should cease, more especially as the intrigues of England appear in this instance to have been successful.1 For some years after this, the quiet current of na tional prosperity in Scotland, occasioned by the steady influence of good government, presents few subjects for the pencil of the historian. Bruce's administra tion appears to have increased in strength and popu larity ; and the royal household, which had been lately gladdened by the birth of a young prince, was now cheered by an important bridal. Christian Bruce, the king's sister, and widow of the brave and unfortunate Christopher Seton, espoused a tried and hardy sol dier, Sir Andrew Moray of Bothwell, afterwards re gent of the kingdom. Moray had been bred to war by Wallace ; and it was a wise part of the policy of Bruce, to attach to himself the bravest soldiers by matrimonial alliances. The joy of the country, how ever, at these happy events, was not long after over clouded by the death of Walter, the High Steward of Scotland, and son-in-law to the king. He seems to have been deeply and deservedly lamented. When 1 F\u0153dera, vol. iv. p. 176. 3"], [401, "1326.

It is important to notice, that this is the earliest historical intimation of the representatives of the cities and burghs being admitted into the composition of the Scottish parlia ment.

Although the in tentions of the English regency, who acted as council to the king, were decidedly pacific, so that the truce was ratified in the name of the young king, and com missioners appointed to renew the negotiations for peace ; yet Bruce soon manifested a disposition to re new the war. He had been disgusted by the repeated instances of bad faith upon the part of the English government,2 and taking advantage of the minority of the king and the civil dissensions, which had great ly weakened the country, he assembled a formidable army on the borders, and declared his resolution of disregarding a truce which had been broken by one of the parties, and of instantly invading England, un less prevented by a speedy and advantageous peace. Against these warlike preparations the English mi nistry adopted decisive measures. The whole military array of England was summoned to meet the king at Newcastle on the 18th of May ; and the Duke of Norfolk, Marshal of England, and uncle to young Edward, was commanded to superintend the muster. 1 Tyrrel's Hist, of England, vol. iii. p. 325. 2 Fordun a Hearne, vol. iv. p. 1014."], [403, "1327.

The naval force of the southern ports was ordered to be at Skimburness, near the mouth of the Tees. Two fleets, one named the Eastern and the other the Western Fleet of Eng land, were directed to be employed against the Scots. The men living on the borders and in the northern shires, received orders to join the army with all speed, marching day and night, and to send their women and children for shelter to distant places, or castles;1 and those who were too old to fight were obliged to find a substitute. Anxious to give spirit to the sol diers, and to watch the designs of the enemy, the young king and the rest of the royal family came to York, accompanied by John of Hainault, with a fine body of heavy-armed Flemish horse ; who was not long after joined by John of Quatremars, at the head of another reinforcement of foreign cavalry.2 Confi dent in the warlike preparations, the negotiations for the attainment of peace soon became cold and embar rassed ; and from the terms proposed by the English commissioners, it was evident that they, as well as Bruce, had resolved upon the prosecution of the war. Accordingly, soon after this, a defiance was brought to the youthful mouarch from the King of Scotland, and the herald was commanded to inform him and his 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, 1st Edw.

Bruce himself was about this time attacked by a mortal sickness, brought on hy that excessive fatigue, and constant exposure to the inclemency of the seasons, which he had endured in his early, wars.1 The extreme weakness occasioned by this, rendered it impossible for him to take the field in person ; but Randolph and Douglas, his two bra- vest and ablest captains, put themselves at the head of an army often thousand men, and passing the Tyne near Carlisle, soon showed, that although the king was not present, the skill, enterprise, and unshaken courage which he had inspired, continued to animate his soldiers.2 This is the last military expedition of this reign, and as it places in a strong and interesting light the species of warfare by which Bruce was en- abled to reconquer and consolidate his kingdom, as contrasted with the gigantic efforts employed against him, we shall make no apology for a somewhat minute detail of its operations. Froissart, too, one of the most delightful and graphic of the old historians, ap pears now in the field, and throws over the picture the tints of his rich feudal painting. Accounts soon reached the English king, that the Scots had broken into the northern counties, and in- 1 Ker'a Bruce, vol. ii. p. 357. 8 Barbour, p. 387.

ROBERT BRUCE. 389 stant orders were given for the host to arrange them selves under their respective banners, and advance against the enemy, on the road to Durham. The Eng lish army, according to Froissart, consisted of sixty-two thousand men, of which eight thousand were knights and squires, armed, both man and horse, in steel, and excellently mounted, fifteen thousand lighter armed cavalry, who rode hackneys, and fifteen thousand in fantry. To these were added twenty-four thousand archers.1 The army was divided into three columns, or battles, all of infantry, each battle having two wings of heavy-armed cavalry of five hundred men. Against this great army, admirable in its discipline and equip ment, the Scots had to oppose a very inferior force. It consisted of three thousand knights aud squires, armed cap-a-pie, and mounted on strong good horses, and twenty thousand light-armed cavalry, excellently adapted for skirmishing, owing to their having along with them no impediments of luggage, or carts and waggons, and their being mounted on hardy little hackneys, which can live and go through their work in the most barren country, where other horses would die of want. \" These Scottishmen,\" says Froissart, \" are exceeding hardy, through their constant wear ing of arms, and experience in war. When they en ter England, they will in a single day and night march four-and-twenty miles, taking with them nei ther bread nor wine ; for such is their sobriety, that they are well content with flesh half sodden, and for 1 Froissart, chap. 35.

They are sure to find cattle enough in the countries they break into, and they can boil or seeth them in their own skins ; so that a little bag of oatmeal, trussed behind their saddle, and an iron plate, or girdle, on which they bake their crakenel, or biscuit, and which is fixed between the saddle and the crupper, is their whole purveyance for the field.\" It requires little discernment to see, that a force of this description is admirably adapted for warfare in mountainous and desert countries ; and that a regular army, however excellently equipped, being impeded by luggage, waggons, and camp-follow ers, can have little chance against it. So accordingly the event soon showed. Advancing from York, the English army could learn no tidings of the Scots until they entered Nor thumberland, when the smoke that rose from the vil lages and hamlets which they had burnt in their pro gress, too plainly indicated their wasting line of march.1 Although the Marshal of England had been stationed at Newcastle with a large body of troops, and the Earl of Hereford and Sir John Mowbray commanded at Carlisle with a strong garrison, the Scottish army had crossed the Tyne with such silence and rapidity, that the blazing villages of Northum berland were the first messengers which informed their enemies of their approach. From morning to night did the English army for two days pursue these melancholy beacons, without being able to get a sight 1 Froissart, vol. i. p. 80."], [407, "1327. ROBERT BRUCE. 391 of the Scottish army, although they burnt and laid waste the country within five miles of their main army. But the English appear to have been little ac quainted with the country, and obliged to march with great slowness and precaution through the woods and marshes, the rocky and mountainous passes with which it was intersected ; whilst the Scots, veterans in this species of warfare, and intimately familiar with the country, drove every living thing from before their enemies, wasted the forage, burnt the granaries, and surrounded their army with a blackened and smoking desert, through which they passed without a sight of their destroyers. After a vain pursuit of three days, through desert and rugged paths, the English army, greatly exhausted with toil, hunger, and watching, determined to direct their march again to the Tyne, and having crossed that river, to await the return of the Scots, and cut off their retreat into their own country. This they accomplished towards nightfall with great difficulty, and the army was kept under arms, each man lying beside his horse with the reins in his hands, ready to mount at a moment's warn ing, with the vain hope that the daylight would show them their enemy, whom they idly conjectured would return by the same ford which they had crossed in their advance. Meanwhile, this great army began to experience all those bitter sufferings, which the Scot tish mode of warfare was so well calculated to bring upon them.1 The rain poured down and swelled the river, so that its passage became perilous ; their car- 1 Barnes's Edward III. p. 10."], [408, "1327. 392 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. riages and waggons, containing the wine and victuals, had been by orders of the leaders left behind ; and each soldier had carried behind his horse-crupper a single loaf of bread, which the rain and the sweat from the horse, had rendered uneatable ; the horses them selves had not tasted meat for a day and night, and the soldiers had the greatest difficulty in sheltering themselves from the weather, by cutting down the green branches, and making themselves lodges, whilst the horses supported themselves by cropping the leaves. There was much suffering also from the want of light and fire, as the green wood would not burn, and only a few of the greater barons had brought torches with them, so that the army lay on the cold ground under a heavy rain, ignorant, from the darkness, of the situa tion which they occupied, and obliged to keep upon the alert, lest they should be surprised by the enemy. In this plight the morning found them, when they discovered from the country folk that their encamp ment was about twelve miles from Newcastle, and ele ven from Carlisle, but could hear no tidings of the Scots.1 It was determined, however, to await their return, and for eight days they lay upon the bank ot the Tyne, in the vain idea of cutting off the retreat of the enemy, while the rain continued to pour down in torrents, and their sufferings and privations to in crease every hour, so that murmurs and upbraidings began to arise amongst the soldiers ; and the leaders, alarmed by the symptoms of mutiny, determined to repass the river, and again march in search of the 1 Froissart, vol. i. pp. 86, 87, 88, 89."], [409, "1327. ROBERT BRUCE. 393 enemy. Having accomplished this, proclamation was made through the host, that the king would honour with knighthood, and a grant of land, any soldier, who would lead him to where he could cope on dry ground with the Scots ; 1 and sixteen knights and squires rode off on the adventure, which was quickly accomplished, for one of them, Thomas de Rokeby, was soon after taken prisoner by the advanced guards of the Scots, and carried before Douglas and Randolph. These leaders, confident in the strength of the posi tion which they occupied, sent the squire back to his companions, with orders to lead the English army to the spot where they were encamped, adding, that Ed ward could not be more anxious to see them than they were to be confronted with him and his barons. Roke by, having found the king with his army at Blanch land, on the river Derwent, informed them of his suc cess ; and next morning, the army, having been drawn up in order of battle, marched, under the guidance of Rokeby, through Weardale, and about mid-day came in sight of the Scottish army, occupying very strong ground on the slope of a hill, at the foot of which ran the rapid river Wear.2 The flanks of the position were defended by rocks, which it was impossible to turn, and which overhung the river so as to command its passage, whilst the stream itself, full of huge stones, and swoln by the late rains, could not be passed with out the greatest risk. Having halted and reconnoi- 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. iv. p. 312. 2 Barnes's Edward III. p. 12.

The Scottish leaders were too well experienced in war to be moved by this bra vado. \" It is known,\" said they, in reply to the de fiance, \" to the king and barons of England, that we are here in their kingdom, and have burnt and wasted the country. If displeased therewith, let them come and chastise us if they choose, for here we mean to remain as long as we please.\" 1 On the first sight of the strength of the Scottish position, the English leaders had given orders for the whole army to be drawn up on foot, in three great columns or battles, having commanded the knights and men-at-arms to lay aside their spurs, and join the ranks of the infantry. In this order the army of Eng land continued for three days, vainly endeavouring, by man\u0153uvres and bravadoes, to compel the Scottish leaders to leave their strong ground, and accept their 1 Froissart, vol. i. p. 95.

He has also confounded this expedition with a subsequent inroad of Bruce into England, describing the at tack upon Norham as having taken place previous to the encamp - ment on the Wear. The consultation of contemporary authorities would have informed him, that the campaign of Randolph and Douglas, and the encampment at Stanhope Park, took place in 5th August, 1327. The siege of Norham did not commence till Sep tember \u2014 Hume's Hist. vol. iii. p. 245."], [411, "1327. ROBERT BRUCE. 395 challenge. Every night the whole host lay upon their arms, resting on the bare rocky ground ; and as they had no means of tying or picketing their horses, the cavalry were compelled to snatch a brief interval of sleep with their reins in their hand, and harness on their back, destitute of litter or forage, and without fuel to make fires for their comfort and refreshment. On the other hand, they had the mortification to be near enough to see and hear the merriment of the Scottish camp, to observe that their enemies retired nightly to their huts, after duly stationing their watches ; to see the whole hill blazing with the fires, round which they were cooking their victuals ; and to listen to the winding of the horns, with which the leaders called in the stragglers and pillaging parties. Although irritated and mortified with all this, the English absurdly determined to remain where they were. They had learnt from some prisoners, taken in skirmishing, that their enemies had neither bread nor wine ; and, to use the words of Froissart, it was the \" intention of the English to holde the Scots there in manner as besieged, thinking to have famished them.\" But a few hours sufficed to show the folly of such a design. The third night had left the two armies as usual in sight of each other, the Scottish fires blazing, their horns resounding through the hills, and their opponents lying under arms. In the morning, the English, instead of the gleam of arms, and the wa ving of the pennons of an encamped army, saw no thing before them but a bare hill side.1 Their ene- 1 Froissart, vol. i. pp. 97, 98."], [412, "396 1320. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. mies, intimately acquainted with the country, had found out, at two miles' distance, a stronger position, had secretly decamped, and were soon discovered by the scouts in a wood calledStanhope Park, situated on a hill, at nearly the same distance from the river Wear as their first encampment.1 This ground had equal advantages in commanding the river with their first position, and it was not only more difficult of access and of attack, but enabled them, under cover of the wood, to conceal their opera tions. Having been thus completely out-man\u0153uvred, and made aware on how frail a basis had been rested their project for starving out their enemy, the Eng lish army marched down the side of the Wear, and encamped on a hill fronting the Scots, and having the river still interposed between them. Fatigued and disheartened by their sufferings and reverses, they became remiss in their new encampment, and a daring night attack of Douglas had nearly put an end to the campaign, by the death or captivity of the young monarch of England.2 This leader, having dis covered a ford at a considerable distance from both armies, passed the river at midnight with five hun dred chosen horse ; with these he gained unperceived the rear of the English camp, and, as he reached the outposts, assumed the manner of an English officer going his rounds, calling out, \" Ha, St George ! no watch !\" He was thus able without detection to pass 1 Barbour, pp. 394, 395. 2 Barnes's Edward III. p. 14.

ROBERT BRUCE. 397 the barriers, and whilst one part of his men made an attack on a different quarter, he himself, and those in his company, shouted out \" Douglas !\" and fell so fiercely and suddenly upon the enemy, that three hundred were slain in a' few minutes ; still pressing on, and putting spurs to his horse, Douglas penetra ted to the royal tent, cut the tent-ropes, and would have carried off the young king, but for the resistance of the royal household. The king's chaplain bravely defended his master, and was slain ; others followed his example, and shared his fate ; but the interval thus gained gave the king time to escape, and roused the whole army, so that Douglas found it necessary to retreat. Blowing his horn, he charged through the thickening mass of his enemies, and with a very inconsiderable loss, rejoined his friends. Disappoint ed of his prey, Douglas, on being asked by Randolph what speed they had made, replied, \" They had drawn blood, but that was all.\"1 Provisions now began to fail in the Scottish camp, which had hitherto been plentifully supplied, and Douglas and Randolph consulted together what was best to be done. Randolph recommended the hazard ing a battle ; but Douglas, who, with all his keenness for fighting, was a great calculator of means, insisted that the disparity of force was too great, and proposed a retreat, which, from the nature of the ground, was nearly as dangerous as a battle. Behind the Scottish camp was stretched a large moss, which was deemed > Barbour, p. 399."], [414, "1320. 398 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. impassable for cavalry, and which had effectually pre vented any attack in their rear. In the front was the river Wear, the passage guarded by the English army, which outnumbered the Scots by forty thousand men, and on each flank were steep and precipitous banks. To have attempted to break up their camp, and retreat in the day-time, in the face of so superior an enemy, must have been certain ruin. The Scot tish leaders, accordingly, on the evening which they had chosen for their departure, lighted up their camp fires, and kept up a great noise of horns, and shouting as they had been wont to do. Meanwhile they had prepared a number of hurdles, made of wands or boughs, tightly bound and wattled together, and had packed up in the smallest compass all their most pre cious booty. At midnight they drew off from their encampment, leaving their fires burning, and having dismounted on reaching the morass\", they threw down the hurdles upon the softer places of the bog, and thus passed over the water-runs in safety, taking care to remove the hurdles so as to prevent pursuit by the enemy.1 The day before this, a Scottish knight had fallen into the hands of the English du ring a skirmish, and being strictly questioned, he in formed the king that the soldiers had received or ders to hold themselves in readiness to follow the hanner of Douglas in the evening. Anticipating from this information another night attack, the whole English army drew up on foot, in three divisions, in 1 Barbour, p. 402. Froissart, vol. i. p. 101."], [415, "1320. ROBERT BRUCE. 399 order of battle ; and having given their horses in charge to the servants who remained in the camp- huts, lay all night under arms, expecting to be as- saulted every moment. Night, however, passed away without any alarm ; and a little before daylight, two Scottish trumpeters were taken by the English scouts, and reported that the Scottish army had decamped at midnight, and were already advanced five miles on their way homewards. An instantaneous pursuit might still have placed the retreating army in cir- cumstances of great jeopardy ; but the success of Douglas's night attack had made the English over cautious, and they continued under arms till broad day- light, suspecting some stratagem or ambush. When, after a little time, nothing was seen, some scouts were sent across the river, who returned with the intelli- gence that the Scots had made good their retreat, and that their camp was entirely evacuated. The camp itself presented a singular spectacle. In it were found five hundred slaughtered cattle, and more than three hundred cauldrons, or kettles, which were made of skins of cattle with the hair on, suspended on stakes, and full of meat and water, ready for boiling, with about a thousand spit racks, with meat on them, and about ten thousand pairs of old shoes made of raw hides, with the hair on the outer side. The only living things found in the camp were five poor Eng lishmen, stript naked and tied to trees. Three of these unfortunate men had their legs broken, a piece of savage cruelty, which, if committed with their"], [416, "1320. 400 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND knowledge, throws a deep stain upon Douglas and Randolph. On hearing this, it is said that the young king, grievously disappointed at the mortifying result of an expedition commenced with such high hopes, and in volving such mighty preparations, could not refrain from tears. In the meantime, the Scottish army, with safety and expedition, regained their own coun try in high health and spirits, and enriched with the plunder of a three weeks' raid in England. Very different was the condition of the army of Edward. The noble band of foreign cavalry, consisting of knights and men-at-arms from Hainault, Flanders, and Brabant, commanded by John of Hainault, were reduced, by the privation and fatigue of a mode of war fare with which they were little acquainted, to a state of great wretchedness.1 On reaching York, their horses had all died, or become unserviceable ; and the rest of the English cavalry were in an almost equal state of exhaustion and disorganisation. The disastrous ter mination of this campaign very naturally inspired the English government with a desire of peace ; and al though the blame, connected with the retreat of the Scots, was attempted to be thrown upon the treachery of Mortimer, and a proclamation issued from Stan hope Park ridiculously described the Scots as having stolen away in the night, like vanquished men,2 the 1 Ker's Life of Bruce, vol. ii. p. 431.

The exhaustion of the English treasury, and the jea lousy and heartburnings between Mortimer and the principal nobility, rendered it exceedingly improba ble that a continuance of the war would lead to any better success, and these desires for peace were not a little strengthened by the sudden appearance of the King of Scotland in person, who broke into England by the eastern borders, at the head of an army, in cluding every person in Scotland able to bear arms.1 Bruce himself sat down before Norham, with a part of his army ; a second division was commanded to waste Northumberland ; and a third, under Douglas and Randolph, laid siege to Alnwick Castle ; but before hostilities had proceeded to any length, com missioners from England were in the camp of the Scottish king, with a proposal for the marriage of Joanna, the Princess of England, and sister to the king, to David, the only son of the King of Scots. Bruce required, as the preliminary basis on which all future negotiation was to proceed, that Edward should renounce for ever all claim of feudal superiority which he and his predecessors had pretended to possess over the kingdom of Scotland. To agree to this conces sion, appears to have been beyond the powers of the commissioners ; and a parliament was summoned for 1 Barbour, p. 404. 2 C VOL.

Robert was acknowledged as King of Scotland, and Scotland itself recognised for ever as a free and independent kingdom. It was declared by Edward, in the solemn words of the instrument of renunciation, \" that whereas we, and others of our predecessors, Kings of England, have en deavoured to obtain a right of dominion and superiority over the kingdom of Scotland, and have thereby been the cause of long and grievous wars between the two kingdoms ; we, therefore, considering the numerous slaughters, sins, and bloodshed, the destruction of churches, and other evils brought upon the inhabi tants of both kingdoms by such wars, and the many advantages which would accrue to the subjects of both realms, if, by the establishment of a firm and perpe tual peace, they w7ere secured against all rebellious de signs, have, by the assent of the prelates, barons, and commons of our kingdom, in parliament assembled, granted, and hereby do grant, for us, and our heirs and successors whatsoever, that the kingdom of Scot- 1 The truce was to last from 23d Nov. till the 22d March 1328.

And we hereby renounce and convey to the said King of Scotland, his heirs and successors, what ever right we, or our ancestors in times past, have laid claim to in any way over the kingdom of Scotland. And by these same presents, we renounce and declare void, for ourselves, and our heirs and successors, all obligations, agreements, or treaties whatsoever, touch ing the subjection of the kingdom of Scotland, and the inhabitants thereof, entered into between our pre decessors and any of the kings thereof, or their subjects, whether clergy or laity.

Accordingly, peace with Eng land was concluded at Edinburgh, on the 17th of March 1327,2 and confirmed on the part of the Eng lish government, in a parliament held at Northamp ton, on the 4th of May 1328. It was stipulated, that there should be a perpetual peace between the two kingdoms of England and Scotland, for confirmation of which, a marriage should take place between David, eldest son and heir of the King of Scotland, and Jo anna, sister to the King of England.

The two kings, with their heirs and successors, en gaged to be good friends and faithful allies in as sisting each other, always saving to the King of Scots the ancient alliance between him and the King of France ; and in the event of a rebellion against Eng land in the kingdom of Ireland, or against Scotland, in Man, Skye, or the other islands, the two kings mutually agree not to abet or assist their rebel sub jects. All writings, obligations, instruments, or other muniments, relative to the subjection which the kings of England had attempted to establish over the peo ple and land of Scotland, and which are annulled by the letters-patent of the King of England, as well as all other instruments and charters respecting the free dom of Scotland, as soon as they are found, were to be delivered up to the King of Scots ; and the King of England expressly engaged to give his assistance, in order that the processes of excommunication against the King of Scots and his subjects, which had been carried through at the Court of Rome, and elsewhere, should be recalled and annulled. It was agreed, more over, on the part of the king, the prelates, and the nobles of Scotland, that the sum of twenty thousand"], [422, "406 1328.

It was finally covenanted, that the laws and regulations of the marches were to be punctually adhered to by both monarchs ; and al though omitted in the treaty, it was stipulated in some separate instrument, that the stone upon which the Kings of Scotland were wont to sit at their coro nation, and which had been carried away by Edward the First, should be restored to the Scots.1 There can be no doubt that this treaty was highly unpopular in England.

On what ground this doubt is founded, unless on the erroneous idea that no copy of the treaty could be discovered, it is difficult to imagine. He remarks in a note, that a parliament was held at Northampton in April. It was at this parliament, that the treaty of Northampton was agreed to. \" Doune a Northampton, le quart jour de May, Ian de nostre regne secont.\" What are we to think, then, of his concluding ob servation,\u2014\" but no important business was done, on account of the absence of the principal members ?\""], [423, "1328.

To Bruce, indeed, the peace was in every respect a glorious one ; but it was wise and seasonable as well as glorious. Robert anxiously desired to settle his kingdom in tranquillity.

During the negotiations for the treaty of Northampton, Elizabeth, his second wife, had followed her to the grave ; his gallant brothers, partly on the scaffold, and partly on the field, had died without issue ; his only son was an infant, and his grandson, a boy of ten years old, who had lost both his parents. In these circumstances, peace was a signal blessing to the nation, and a joyful relief to himself. The complete independence of Scotland, for which the people of that land had obstinately sustained a war of thirty-two years' duration, was at last amply acknow ledged, and established on the firmest basis ; and Eng land, with her powerful fleets, and superb armies, her proud nobility, aud her wealthy exchequer, was, by superior courage and military talent, compelled to re nounce for ever her schemes of unjust aggression. In the conduct of this war, and in its glorious termina tion, Bruce stood alone, and shared the glory with no one. He had raised the spirit of his people to an as cendency over their enemies, which is acknowledged by the English historians themselves, and in all the great military transactions of the war, we can discern the presence of his inventive and presiding genius. He was indeed nobly assisted by Douglas and Ran dolph ; but it was he that had first marked their mi litary talents, and it was under his eye that they had grown up into a maturity of excellence, which, found nothing that could cope with them in the martial no bility of England. Having thus accomplished the"], [425, "1329. 409 ROBERT BRUCE. great object of his life, and warned by intimations which could not be mistaken, that a mortal disease had fixed upon him, the king retired to his palace at Cardross, on the eastern shore of the Clyde. His amusements, in the intervals of disease, were kingly, and his charities extensive. He built ships, and re created himself by sailing ; he kept a lion for his di version, and when his health permitted, delighted in hawking ; in compliance with the manners of the times, he maintained a fool ; he entertained his no bility in a style of rude and abundant hospitality, and the poor received regular supplies of meat by the king's order.1 Meanwhile the Princess Joanna of England, then in her seventh year, accompanied by the Queen Dow- ager, the Earl of Mortimer, the Bishop of Lincoln, High Chancellor of England, and attended by a splen- did retinue, began her journey to Scotland. At Ber- wick she was received by David, her young bride- groom, then only five years of age. Randolph and Sir James Douglas, whom King Robert, detained by his increasing illness, had sent as his representatives, accompanied the prince, and the marriage was cele- brated at Berwick with great joy and magnificence.2 The attendants of the princess brought along with them, to be delivered in terms of the treaty of North ampton, the Ragman Roll, containing the names of all those Scotsmen who had been compelled to pay 1 Ker's History of Robert the First, vol. ii. pp. 473, 474> and Chamberlain Rolls, there quoted. 2 Fordun a Hearne, vol. iv. p. 1016.

Bruce was able to receive his son and his youthful consort with a warm and affectionate welcome at Edinburgh, but finding his disease increasing upon him, he returned immediately to his rural seclusion at Cardross, where he died on the 7th June 1329, at the age of fifty-five. Some time before his death an interesting scene took place, which I shall give in the beautiful and affect ing narrative of Froissart. \" In the meantime,\" says that historian, \" it hap pened that King Robert of Scotland was right sore aged and feeble, for he was grievously oppressed with the great sickness, so that there was no way with him but death ; and when he felt that his end drew near, he sent for such barons and lords of his realm as he most trusted, and very affectionately entreated and commanded them, on their fealty, that they should faithfully keep his kingdom for David his son, and when this prince came of age, that they should obey him, and place the crown on his head. After which, he called to him the brave and gentle knight Sir James Douglas, and said, before the rest of the cour tiers,\u2014' Sir James, my dear friend, none knows better than you how great labour and suffering I have un dergone in my day, for the maintenance of the rights of this kingdom ; and when I was hardest beset, I made a vow which it now grieves me deeply that I have 1 Carte, vol. ii. p. 397."], [427, "1329. ROBERT BRUCE. 411 not accomplished. I vowed to God, that if I should live to see an end of my wars, and be enabled to go vern this realm in peace and security, I would then set out in person, and carry on war against the ene mies of my Lord and Saviour, to the best of my power. Never has my heart ceased to bend to this point ; but our Lord has not consented thereto ; for I have had my hands full in my days, and now, at the last, I am seized with this grievous sickness, so that, as you all see, I have nothing to do but to die. And since my body cannot go thither, and accom plish that which my heart hath so much desired, I have resolved to send my heart there, in place of my body, to fulfil my vow ; and now, since in all my realm I know not any knight more hardy than your self, or more thoroughly furnished with all knightly qualities for the accomplishment of the vow, in place of myself, therefore, I entreat thee, my dear and tried friend, that for the love you bear to me, you will un dertake this voyage, and acquit my soul of its debt to my Saviour ; for I hold this opinion of your truth and nobleness, that whatever you undertake, I am persuaded you will successfully accomplish ; and thus shall I die in peace, provided that you do all that I shall tell you. I will, then, that as soon as I am dead, you take the heart out of my body, and cause it to be embalmed, and take as much of my treasure as seems to you sufficient for the expenses of your journey, both for you and your companions ; and that you carry my heart along with you, and deposit it in"], [428, "1329- 412 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. the Holy Sepulchre of aur Lord, since this poor body cannot go thither. And it is my command, that you do use that royal state and maintenance in your jour ney, both for yourself and your companions, that into whatever lands or cities you may come, all may know that you have iu charge to bear beyond seas the heart of King Robert of Scotland.' \" At these words, all who stood by began to weep; and when Sir James himself was able to reply, he said, \u2014 ' Ah ! most gentle and noble king, a thousand times do I thank you for the great honour you have done me, in making me the depositary and bearer of so great and precious a treasure. Most faithfully and willingly, to the best of my power, shall I obey your commands, albeit I would have you believe, that I think myself but little worthy to achieve so high an enterprise.' \u2014 ' Ah ! gentle knight,' said the king, ' I heartily thank you, provided you promise to do my bidding, on the word of a true and loyal knight.' \u2014 ' Assuredly, my liege, I do promise so,' replied Dou glas, \u2022 by the faith which I owe to God, and to the order of knighthood.' \u2014 ' Now, praise be to God,' said the king, ' for I shall die in peace, since I am assured that the best and most valiant knight of my kingdom has promised to achieve for me that which I myself could never accomplish.' And not long af ter, this noble king departed this life.\" ' At this, or some other interview, shortly before his death, Bruce delivered to the Scottish barons 1 Froissart, vol. i. p. 113, Edition de Buchan."], [429, "1329. 413 ROBERT BRUCE. his last injunctions regarding the best mode of con ducting the war against England. They concentrate, in a small compass, the wisdom and experience which he had gained during the whole course of his pro tracted but glorious war ; and it is perhaps not too much to say, that there is no instance in their future history, in which the Scots have sustained any signal defeat, where it cannot be traced to a departure from some of the directions of what is affectionately called the \" Good King Robert's Testament.\" His injunc tions were, that the Scots in their wars ought always to fight on foot ; that, instead of walls and garrisons, they should use the mountains, the morasses, and the woods ; having for arms the bow, the spear, and the battle-axe ; driving their herds into the narrow glens, and fortifying them there, whilst they laid waste the plain country by fire, and compelled the enemy to evacuate it. \" Let your scouts and watches,\" he con cluded, \" be vociferating through the night, keeping the enemy in perpetual alarm ; and, worn out with fa mine, fatigue, and apprehension, they will retreat as certainly as if routed in battle.\" Bruce did not re quire to add, that then was the time for the Scots to commence their attacks, and to put in practice that species of warfare which he had taught them to use with such fatal effect.1 Indeed, these are the prin- 1 See the original leonine verses, with an old Scotch translation, taken from Hearne's Fordun, vol. iv. p. 1002, in Notes and Illus trations, letters CC.

But living at so remote a period, the lighter shades and touches which confer individuality, are lost in the distance. We only see through the mists which time has cast around it, a figure of colossal proportion, walking amid his sha dowy peers ; and it is deeply to be regretted that the ancient chroniclers, whose pencil might have brought him before us as fresh and true as when he lived, have disdained to notice many minute circum stances, with which we now seek in vain to become acquainted ; yet some faint idea of his person may be gathered from the few scattered touches preserved by these authors, and the greater outlines of his character are too strongly marked to escape us. In his figure, the king was tall and well shaped. Before broken down by illness, and in the prime of life, he was nearly six feet high ; his hair curled close- 1 Sketches in Persia, vol. ii. p. 210."], [431, "1329. ROBERT BRUCE. 415 ly and shortly rouud his neck, which possessed that breadth and thickness that belong to men of great strength ; he was broad-shouldered and open-chested, and the proportion of his limbs combined power with lightness and activity. These qualities were increased not only by his constant occupation in war, but by his fondness for the chase, and all manly amusements. It is not known whether he was dark or fair com plexioned, but his forehead was low, his cheek bones strong and prominent, and the general expression of his countenance open and cheerful, although he was maimed by a wound which had injured his lower jaw. His manners were dignified and engaging ; af ter battle, nothing could be pleasanter or more cour teous ; and it is infinitely to his honour, that in a sa vage age, and smarting under injuries which attacked him in his kindest and tenderest relations, he never abused a victory, but conquered often as effectually by his generosity and kindness, as by his great mili tary talents. We know, however, from his interview with the Papal legates, that when he chose to express displeasure, his look was stern and kingly, and at once imposed silence and ensured obedience. He ex celled in all the exercises of chivalry, to such a de gree, indeed, that the English themselves did not scruple to account him the third best knight in Eu rope.1 His memory was stored with the romances of the period, in which he took great delight. Their hair-breadth scapes and perilous adventures were sometimes scarcely more wonderful than his own, and 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 295."], [432, "1329. 416 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. he had early imbibed from such works an appetite for individual enterprise and glory, which, had it not been checked by a stronger passion, the love of liber ty, might have led him into fatal mistakes. It is quite conceivable, that Bruce, instead of a great king, might, like Richard the First, have become only a kingly knight-errant. But from this error he was saved by the love of his country, directed by an admirable judgment, an un shaken perseverance, and a vein of strong good sense. It is here, although some may think it the homeliest, that we are to find assuredly the brightest part of the character of the king. It is these qualities which are especially conspicuous in his long war for the li berty of Scotland. They enabled him to follow out his plans through many a tedious year with undevia ting energy ; to bear reverses, to calculate his means, to wait for his opportunities, and to concentrate his whole strength upon one great point, till it was gain ed and secured to his country for ever. Brilliant mi litary talent and consummate bravery have often been found amongst men, and proved far more of a curse than a blessing ; but rarely indeed shall we discover them united to so excellent a judgment, controlled by such perfect disinterestedness, and employed for so sacred an end. There is but one instance on record where he seems to have thought more of himself than of his people,1 and even this, though rash, was heroic. By his first wife, Isabella, the daughter of Donald, 1 See supra, p. 304. 7"], [433, "1329. 417 ROBERT BRUCE. tenth Earl of Mar, he had one daughter, Marjory. She married Walter, the hereditary High Steward of Scotland, and bore to him one son, Robert Stewart, afterwards king, under the title of Robert the Second. By his second wife, Elizabeth, the daughter of Rich ard de Burgh, Earl of Ulster, he had one son, David, who succeeded him, and two daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret. Immediately after the king's death, his heart was taken out, as he had himself directed. He was then buried with great state and solemnity under the pave ment of the choir, in the Abbey Church of Dunferm line, and over the grave was raised a rich marble mo nument, which was made at Paris. Centuries pass ed on, the ancient church, with the marble monu ment, fell into ruins, and a more modern building was erected on the same site. This, in our own days, gave way to time, and in clearing the foundations for a third church, the workmen laid open a tomb which proved to be that of Robert the Bruce. The lead coating in which the body was found inclosed, was twisted round the head into the shape of a rude crown. A rich cloth of gold, but much decayed, was thrown over it, and, on examining the skeleton, it was found that the breast-bone had been sawn asunder, to get at the heart.1 1 See an interesting Report of the discovery of the Tomb, and the re-interment of the body of Robert Bruce, drawn up by Sir Henry Jardine, in the second volume of the Transactions of the Antiquarian Society of Scotland, part ii. p. 435.

Letter A, page 6. Dr Likgard, in his History of England, vol. iii. p. 119, ob- serves, that \" the Scottish king consented to an arrangement, by which, although he eluded the express recognition of feudal depen- dence, he seems to have conceded to Henry the whole substance of his demand.\" And the same historian bas remarked, in the same volume, \" that when the Scottish king received a grant of land in Tynedale and at Penrith, and consented to perform a new homage for these possessions, the question as to tbe homage de- manded for Scotland was left undecided.\" If the reader will take the trouble to turn to the first volume of the F\u0153dera, pages 374 and 428, he will at once perceive the strange inaccuracy of these assertions. The legitimate inference to be drawn from the docu- ments in Rymer, is, that the question as to any homage due by Alexander the Second for his kingdom of Scotland, was decided against Henry in 1237, and that the English king acquiesced in the decision ; for it will be observed, the homage then paid was for his new acquisition,1 and there is no reservation of the claim of homage for Scotland. Again it appears, that this decision was virtually en- forced and repeated in the charter granted by Alexander in 1244. Henry's demand was, that Alexander should perform homage to him for his kingdom of Scotland. Alexander, who at that time held lands in England, was reported, says Mathew Paris, to have \" answered bitterly, that he never did, and never would, hold a par ticle of land in Scotland under Henry,\"2 but he at the same time was ready to take the oaths to Henry as his liege lord. This is what Lingard calls \" a concession to Henry of the whole substance of his demand.\" By the very same process of reasoning, it might 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. i. p. 376. 2 Math. Paris, p. 432."], [438, "422 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. be proved that Edward the First held his kingdom of England un der the King of France, as his feudal superior. See Rapin's Acta Regia, vol. i. p. 78.

He adds, that when the same faction accused the queen of having excited her father \" to invade Scotland, and extirpate the nation,\" they were circulating a slander which was basely devised to operate on the two great passions of the vulgar, \u2014 fear and national pride. The words, \" invade Scotland and extirpate the nation,\" are marked by Hailes as if they were a quotation from Mathew Paris. If, however, the historian had turned to Mathew Paris, p. 644, he would have seen, that what the Co myns asserted, was not that the young queen had advised her fa ther to invade Scotland and extirpate the nation, but that \" she had incited her father, the King of England, to come against them with an army in a hostile manner, and make a miserable havoc :\" a charge which, so far from being absurd or slanderous, was strictly founded on fact.

Lord Hailes is at a loss to settle the exact chronology of this sur render by Baliol, but Prynne, whom he does not seem to have con sulted, enables us to do this with considerable accuracy. The deed recording the penance of Baliol is dated at the churchyard of Strath kathro, 7th July.1 The second deed, recording the resignation by Baliol, is dated at the Castle of Brechin, 10th July.

Yet there is still some obscurity, for Fordun a Goodal, b. xi. c. 26, tells us that Baliol was forced to make his penance and rendition at Mon trose, on 10th July. Baldred Bisset, the Scotch envoy at Rome, who was sent there to confute the claims of Edward to the supe riority over Scotland, may perhaps have founded his accusation, that Edward had forged the instrument of Baliol's resignation, upon this discrepancy in the dates.

Lord Hailes laughs at Buchanan and other historians for their credulity and inaccuracy, yet he sometimes nods himself. Thus, he observes, p. 253, vol. i., that \" Buchanan, following Blind Harry, reports that the bridge broke down by means of a stratagem of Wal lace.\" Now Buchanan says, that the \" bridge broke down either by the artifice of the carpenter who had loosened the beams, as our historians assert, or from the weight of the English horse, foot, and machinery ;\" so that there is truly no room for Lord Hailes's sneer against him for his love of the marvellous in this instance. Letter I, page 164. Hemingford, vol. i. p. 165, says, these compact bodies were in a circular form \u2014 \" qui quidem circuli Schiltronis vocabantur.\" Schiltron seems to denote nothing more than a compact body of t"], [449, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATION'S. 433 men. It is thus used by Barbour in his poem of The Bruce, where he describes the battle of Bannockburn \u2014 \" For Scotsmen that them hard essayed, That then were in a schiltrum all.\" Walsingham, p. 75, affirms, that Wallace fortified the front of his position with long stakes driven into the ground, and tied together with ropes, so as to form a hedge. I find no mention of this in He mingford ; nor in Fordun, Wynton, or Trivet. Walsingham's ac count is vague, and unlike truth. He tells us, that Edward first commanded the attack to be made by the Welsh, and that they re fused ; upon which a certain knight addressed tbe king in two monkish rhyming verses, in Latin. Hemingford's account, on the other hand, which I have chiefly followed, is delightfully circum stantial and interesting. He speaks, in his narrative of the battle of Stirling, as if he had the particulars from eye-witnesses ; and Lord Hailes conjectures, that this account of the battle of Falkirk was taken from the lips of some who had been present. It is strange, that feeling its excellence, he has yet omitted some of the most important and graphic incidents. Letter K, page 168. Trivet, p. 313, says, these two religious knights were slain in the beginning of the battle ; but I prefer the authority of Hemingford, p. 165, and Robert de Brunne, p. 305-6. Lord Hailes, following Mathew of Westminster, p. 431, says that Brian de Jay was Mas ter of the Knights Templars in England ; but it is certain, from the Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, 29 Edward I. mm. 12. 11., that he was Master of that Order in Scotland. We there find, \" Brianus de Jaye, Pre- ceptor Militi\u00e6 Templi in Scotia.\" There is a long note in Hailes upon the battle of Falkirk, An nals, vol. i. p. 262, which is worth while noticing for a moment. Its object is to prove, that every account of the battle of Falkirk which has been given by Scottish historians, from Fordun to Aber cromby, is full of trash and misrepresentation, and that his own narrative, which he has drawn up from the English historians, is 2 E"], [450, "434 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. alone to be trusted. In this \" trash\" he includes the assertion, * that there were disputes between Wallace and the Scottish nobles, that some of these nobles were guilty of treachery in abandoning the public cause, and that, on the first onset, the Scottish cavalry with drew, without striking a blow.\" That there was treachery among the Scottish nobles, is satisfacto rily proved by Hemingford, one of those English historians whom Hailes asserts he has followed in his narrative ; but, as already ob served in the text, p. 162, the historian has sedulously omitted all notice of the circumstance which establishes this. That the Scottish horse fled without striking a blow, \" absque ullo gladii ictu,\" when the battle had just begun, is asserted by the same historian, Heming ford ; yet, strange to tell, this does not appear to Hailes to be any thing in the least like treachery. The Scottish cavalry were a body of a thousand armed horse, amongst whom were the flower of the Scottish knights and barons. Yet these, from mere timidity, turned tail, and fled, before a lance was put in rest, and upon the first look of the English. His lordship would have us believe, that the Scot tish knights in the days of Wallace were composed of very nervous and timid stuff indeed. But Hailes has also forgotten that the note is glaringly inconsistent with his own statement at p. 254, where, in giving an account of the feelings of the Scottish barons with regard to Wallace, he asserts, that \" his elevation wounded their pride ; his great services reproached their inactivity in the public cause ;\" that it was the language of the nobility, \" We will not have this man to ride over us ;\" and that \" the spirit of distrust inflamed the passions and perplexed the counsels of the nation.\" This was tbe picture given by Hailes himself, of the sentiments of the Scottish nobles on 29th March 1298. Yet when the Scottish historians venture to observe, that at the battle of Falkirk, only four months after this, the Scottish nobility were weakened by dissen sions, and their army enfeebled by envy of Wallace, the account is sneered at as trash. Why that which is given as authentic history in March, becomes trash in July, is not easily explained. At the end of this tirade against the Scottish historians, Hailes ascribes the incredible story of the Congress between Bruce and Wallace to Fordun, who says not a syllable about it. The author of the tale"], [451, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 435 is Bower, Fordun's continuator. Forduti a Hearne, p. 980, and Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 175.* Letter L, page 168.

The negotiations between Philip and Edward, in 1297, on the point of including the kingdom of Scotland under the truce and pa- cification entered into at Tournay, were unknown to Lord Hailes, as the document which contains so full and explicit an account of them, was not published at the time he wrote his history. They throw an important light on the conduct of Comyn, and the higher Scottish nobility, who refused to join Wallace in his resistance to Edward, as they prove, that one motive for their refusal might be, the hope that Philip's representations would induce Edward to in- clude them and their country in the articles of truce, and in the subsequent treaty of peace, of which these articles were under stood to be the basis. Even so late as the battle of Falkirk, July \" Since writing the first volume of my History, and the Notes and Illustra tions, I have seen Mr Aikman's Translation of Buchanan's History, and I am happy to find that he has noticed (pages 410, 413, and 416) Lord Hailes' par tiality in his accounts of the Battles of Falkirk and Roslin, and his Apology for Menteith. I have not yet studied Mr Aikman's original matter, as his Conti nuation of Buchanan has not yet appeared in his second edition. His notes to Buchanan, form a valuable addition to that classical but often inaccurate histo rian."], [452, "436 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 22, 1298, Comyn, who drew off his vassals, and took no part in the day, might have indulged some hope that Philip's mediation, and the representations of the Pope, would succeed in restoring peace to Scotland, and thus save his own lands, and the estates of the Scottish nobles. For Edward did not give his final an swer, by which he totally excluded Scotland, and all its sub jects, from the articles of truce and pacification, till the 19th August 1298, (Rymer, vol. i. new edit. p. 898,) when he was in camp at Edinburgh. At the same time, although these negotiations give some explanation of the motives which might have influenced the nobles of Scotland in refusing to act with Wallace, they afford no excuse for their weak and selfish conduct. Letter N, page 196. This account of the battle of Roslin is taken from the English his torians, Hemingford, Trivet, and Langtoft, and from our two most va luable and authentic Scottish historians, Wynton and Fordun. Lord Hailes, who professes always to follow the English historians, and this even when he acknowledges that he suspects them of conceal ment and partiality, has given a description of the battle more in the shape of a critical note, than an accurate or characteristic nar rative. He appears to have been ignorant, when he composed his text, of the curious and minute account given by Peter Langtoft, vol. ii. p. 319, although he afterwards quotes him in the corrections and additions. So far from attempting to throw any veil over the events of the day, Langtoft is open and candid as to the entire defeat of the English. Hailes has omitted almost every circum stance which gives a spirit and characteristic reality to this sin gular battle. And not only this ; he misunderstands and misstates the fact, in saying that Segrave, instead of falling back, rashly ad vanced and attacked the Scots. Segrave was surprised and attack ed in his encampment by the Scots ; and so complete was the sur prise, that his son and brother were taken in bed. As to the ridi culous story of Sir Robert Neville miraculously retrieving the day, and the invulnerable qualities conferred on those present at mass, it is a monkish tale, utterly unworthy of belief, as Langtoft informs us that Neville was slain. How it should be admitted into Hailes'"], [453, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 437 text, it is impossible to say. The manner in which this historian has recounted the battle of Roslin, is a warning how far a timid spirit and a desire of general popularity wiU go to destroy the truth and dilute the spirit and vigour of history. He was aware, he tells us, that the English historians, whom he follows, gave a partial account ; yet this account he incorporates into his text. He could bring no well grounded argument against the narrative of Wynton and Fordun, which is supported by the English historian, Langtoft ; yet he in sinuates that the Scottish historians may have exaggerated the suc cesses of the Scottish army at Roslin ; and with this affectation of superiority to national prejudice, he quietly passes them over. There is besides another little piece of disingenuity in his attack upon Tyrrel, whom he sneers at as the great castigator of historians. He first laughs at this valuable writer for introducing Ralph the Cof ferer, under the name of Robert le Coster ; and then remarks, \" the ridiculous part of Tyrrel's narrative is, that after having mentioned the imaginary Robert le Coster, he speaks of Ralph the Cofferer, and discovers another battle, different from that of Roslin, in which the Scots overthrew the English, whom Ralph the Cofferer com manded.\" Now Hailes, if he read Tyrrel, (and he was bound to read him, because he has attacked him,) must have known, that in speaking of the anonymous Chronicle which he quotes, under the title of Chron. Cotton, this historian says, \" The anonymous Chronicle so often cited, gives us somewhat of a different relation of this, or such another defeat.\" He knew also that Tyrrel goes on to observe that, as, according to this Chronicle, the English are said to have been commanded by Ralph the Cofferer, and since no men tion at all is made of the Lord Segrave, \" it makes him suspect that this was not the same engagement with that before-mentioned ; and also, that it may be misplaced in point of time.\" The reader will remark, that Tyrrel throws out a suspicion that there may have been two battles, yet he is so cautious as to say, that the Cotton Chronicle gives us another account of this or such another defeat. In all this, I am at a loss to discover anything ridiculous. On the contrary, the short abridgement given by Tyrrel of the battle, as described in the Cotton Chronicle, is curious and valuable. It is corroborated by Langtoft, by Fordun, and by Wynton. As to the mistake of the name, Robert le Coster, instead of Ralph the Cos-"], [454, "438 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. ferer, Hailes ought to have blamed the Abingdon Chronicle, whicn Tyrrel quotes as his authority, and not Tyrrel himself. It may be thought, perhaps, that I have spent too long in examining this matter ; but I was anxious to vindicate a highly valuable histo rian, from an undeserved slight which had been thrown upon him ; and I cannot help saying, that, with a constant affectation of su periority to all national prejudices, and an assumption of hyper critical accuracy in all his details, I have found many portions of Lord Hailes's History, when examined by the original authori ties, highly partial, vague, and inaccurate. Lingard, vol. iii. p. 322, in his account of the battle of Roslin, is short and superficial, mis led probably by the narrative of Hailes ; and having consulted only Hemingford and Walsingham, Tyrrel, vol. iii. p. 153, says, quoting Walsingham and the Chron. Abingdonense, that Wallace headed the Scots in this battle, but I find no authority in the Scottish wri ters for such an assertion. Letter O, page 200. The fortalice at Lochindorb is thus described by Mr Lewis Grant, in his Account of the Parish of Cromdale : \" A thick wall of ma son work, twenty feet high even at this period, and supposed to have been much higher, surrounds an acre of land within the loch, with watch-towers at every corner, all entire. The entrance to this place is a gate built of freestone, which has a grandeur in it easier felt than expressed. Several vestiges of houses are found .within the walls, besides those of a church, which, without diffi culty, can still be traced in the ruins. Great rafts, or planks of oak, by the beating of the waters against the old walls, occasionally make their appearance. Tradition says, and some credit is due to the report, that the particular account of this building was lost in the days of King Edward the First of England.\" Had the worthy clergyman, who wrote this, studied the history of Scotland in For dun, infinitely the most valuable of all our historians, he would there have found, that Edward, \" in propria persona ad Lochindorb pervenit et ibidem aliquamdiu moram faciens partes boreales ad pa cem cepit.\" It is very delightful to find tradition thus throwing"], [455, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 439 its shadowy reflection upon history, and history its clear and cer tain light upon tradition.

Lord Hailes observes, p. 276, that \" the Scots fondly imagined that Edward would attempt to force the passage, as the impetuous Cressingham had attempted in circumstances not dissimilar ; but,\" he adds, \" the prudence of Edward frustrated their expectation ; having discovered a ford at some distance, he passed the river at the head of his whole cavalry.\" This is quite erroneous ; and Trivet, p. 337, whom he quotes on the margin as his authority, says something"], [456, "440 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. very different. He tells us, that Edward did intend to pass the river by tlte bridge, which, on his arrival, he found had been already destroyed by the Scots, that all passage thereby might be cut off. Baulked in his expectation, \" Edward pitched his tents and pre pared for dinner, when John Comyn approached on the opposite bank with the whole power of the Scots ; upon whose appearance the English army, seizing their arms, mounted their horses, and with these the king himself, entering the river, found, by the di rection of the Lord, a ford for himself and his soldiers.\" Edward, therefore, whose prudence Lord Hailes commends, because he did not imitate the impetuous Cressingham, had actually intended to follow his example, and pass the river by the bridge ; and the Scots, whom his lordship represents as fondly imagining he would do so, evidently entertained no such idea, because they burnt the bridge to prevent him from passing the river. Letter R, page 204. Dr Lingard is singularly careless and inaccurate in everything re lating to Scottish affairs, so far as I have yet examined his History. Of his remarks upon the character and career of Wallace I shall speak elsewhere. Meanwhile, let me set him right in a fact which, had he carefully read the authorities which he quotes, he could scarcely have stated in the terms which be has used. Speaking, p. 328, vol. iii., of the conditions offered by Edward to Comyn, the Bishop of Glasgow, Sir Simon Fraser, and the rest, he adds, \" When the rest of his countrymen made their peace with England, his (that is Wallace's) interests were not forgotten. It was agreed, that he also might put himself on the pleasure and grace of the king, if he thought pro per ;\" and he adds this note \u2014 \" Et quant a Monsieur Guilliam de \" Galeys est accorde qu'il se mette en la volunte, et en la grace no \" tre le Seigneur le Roi, si lui semble que bon soit.\" Lord Hailes \" thinks it doubtful, whether the words ' si lui semble' refer to Wal \" lace or the king ; but they evidently refer to Wallace. The offer \" is made in the same manner to the Bishop of Glasgow, the Stew \" art, &c. ' si lour semble que bon soit.'\" By these expressions of Dr Lingard, the reader is led to believe, that Edward's conduct to his Scottish rebels was not ungenerous or harsh, and that to Wal-"], [457, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 441 lace the same, or nearly the same, terms were offered as to the rest of his countrymen. This is the impression made by the words, \" it was agreed that he also,\" and by the observation, \" the offer is made in the same manner.\" Had Dr Lingard consulted the state paper published in Prynne's Edward the First, pp. 1119, 1120, he would have found, that to Comyn, the Bishop of Glasgow, Sir Simon Fra ser, and the rest, Edward expressly stipulated, \" that their life and limbs should be safe \u2014 that they should not suffer punishment or lose their estates \u2014 and that the ransom they should pay, and the fines to be levied on them for their misdemeanors, should be refer red by them to the good pleasure of the king.\" This last condi tion related only to Comyn, and those who surrendered themselves along with him. Wishart the Bishop of Glasgow, Sir Simon Fra ser, James the Stewart of Scotland, John Soules, and a few others, were promised security for life and limb, freedom from imprison ment, and that they should not lose their lands ; but, according to their degrees of guilt in Edward's mind, a fine of more or less ex tent, and a banishment for a longer or greater time, was inflicted on them ; which conditions they were, to accept, no doubt, \" if to them seemed proper ;\" .'. si lour semble que bon soit.\" And what, by the same authentic deed, was promised to Wallace ? The terms were, an unconditional surrender of himself to the will and mercy of tlte king. It is impossible Dr Lingard should be ignorant, that these terms were almost equivalent to a declaration, that he was doomed to be executed the moment he was taken; and yet he gravely tells us, \" Wallace's interests were not forgotten.\" Had the doctor consulted Langtoft, p. 324, he would have found, that Wallace did, like the rest, propose to surrender himself, on the as surance of safety in life, limbs, and estate ; but that Edward cursed him by the fiend for a traitor, and set a price of three hundred merks on his head. This was an attention to his interests with which he would willingly have dispensed. Letter S, page 211. The best, and evidently the most authentic, accounts of this me morable siege, are to be found in Langtoft's valuable Chronicle, in"], [458, "442 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Hemingford, Trivet, and Walsingham. Math. Westminster, in his turgid, and somewhat apocryphal work, entitled the Flowers of History, has given us a lengthy narrative, interlarded with speeches of his own composition, which he puts into the mouth of Edward. The last scene of the surrender of Olifant is in King Cambyses' vein ; but there is a great want of keeping in Mathew's composi tion. Edward, on receiving the suppliants, and hearing their ap peal to his mercy, tells them, it is his pleasure that they should be hanged and quartered ; after which be bursts into tears.

Letter U, page 216. I have elsewhere observed that Lord Hailes is fond of display ing his ingenuity in white-washing dubious characters, and that, with an appearance of hypercritical accuracy, in his remarks upon other historians, he is often glaringly inaccurate himself. His note upon Sir John Menteth is an instance of this. He represents the fact, that his friend Menteth betrayed Wallace to the English, as founded upon popular tradition \u2014 and the romance of Blind Harry, Wal lace's rhyming biographer ; whom, he adds, every historian copies, but none but Sir Robert Sibbald ventures to quote ; and in his Cor rections and Additions, he observes, that \" his Apology for Men teth has been received with wonderful disapprobation by many readers, because it. contradicts vulgar traditions, and that most re spectable authority, Blind Harry.\" In the face of this sweeping and general assertion, I have to ob serve, that the fact of Wallace being betrayed and taken by Sir John Menteth, is corroborated by a mass of ancient historical authority, both from English and Scottish writers, superior to what perhaps could be brought for most other events in our history, and that as these writers lived long before Blind Harry, he may have copied from them, but it is impossible that they could have copied from him. I shall shortly give the English and Scottish authorities for"], [460, "444 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. the fact, and leave the reader to make his own inferences as to Hailes's accuracy and impartiality. We have already seen from the last Note, that the Chronicle of Lanercost Priory, a valuable MS. of the thirteenth century, preser ved in the British Museum, Claudian DVII. 13., has this passage, \" Captus suit Willelmus Waleis per unum Scottum, scilicet per Dominum Johannem de Mentiphe, et usque London ad Regem adductus, et adjudicatum suit quod traheretur, et suspenderetur, et decollaretur.\" Folio 211. We cannot be surprised that Lord Hailes should have been ignorant of this passage, as he tells us, Annals, vol. ii. p. 316, he had not been able to discover where the MS. Chronicle of Lanercost was preserved. The same excuse, however, will not avail him as to the next piece of evidence of Menteth's having seized Wallace. It is con tained in Leland's extract from an ancient MS. chronicle, which Hailes has elsewhere quoted. I mean the Scala Chronicle, preser ved in Corpus Christi Library, Cambridge. In Leland's Collect, vol. i. p. 541, we have this passage from the chronicle. \" Wylliam Waleys was taken of the Counte of Menteth about Glaskow, and sent to King Edward, and after was hangid, drawn, and quarterid, at London.\" This is only Leland's abridgement of the passage, which in all probability is much more full and satisfactory in the original. Yet it is quite satisfactory as to Menteth's guilt. The next English authority is Langtoft's Chronicle, which Hailes has himself quoted in his Notes and Corrections, vol. ii. p. 346. It is curious, and as to Menteth's guilt perfectly conclusive. Sir Jon of Menetest sewed William so nehi, He took him when he wend lest, on nyght his leman bi ; That was thorght treson of Jak Schort his man ; He was the encheson, that Sir Jon so him nam. P. 329. We learn from this, that Sir John Menteth prevailed upon Wal lace's servant, Jack Short, to betray his master, and came under cover of night and seized him in bed, \" his leman by,\" and when he had no suspicion of what was to happen. How Hailes, after quoting this passage, which was written more than two centuries before Blind Harry, should have represented this poor minstrel as the only original authority for the guilt of Menteth, it is indeed dif ficult to determine."], [461, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 445 Fordun, who was born towards the conclusion of the reign of Alexander the Third, received materials for his history from Ward law, Bishop of Glasgow. This prelate died in 1386. Say that Fordun concluded his history in 1376, ten years before Wardlaw's death, it will follow that it was ninety-four years before the poem of Blind Harry, the date of whose poem is somewhere about 1470. Let us hear how he speaks of the death of Wallace. \" Anno Domini M.CCCV., Willelmus Wallace per Johannem de Menteth fraudulenter et pradicionaliter capitur, Regi Angli\u00e6 traditur, Londoniis demembratur.\" Vol. iv. p. 996. Wynton, against whose credit as a historical authority Hailes could not possibly have objected, finished his chronicle in 1418, fifty-two years before Blind Harry's poem was written. Yet Wynr ton thus speaks of the capture of Wallace. Vol. ii. p. 130. \"'A thousand thre hundyr and the fyft yere Ester the byrth of our Lord dere, Schyre Jon of Menteth in tho* dayis Tuk in Glasco Willame Walays.\" And the chapter where this is mentioned, is entitled, Quhen Jhon of Menteth in his dayis, Dissawit gud Willame Walays. Bower, the continuator of Fordun, and who possessed his manu scripts, was born in 1385, and is generally believed to have pub lished his Continuation about 1447, sixty-two years before Blind Harry's poem. He preserves, however, the very words of his master, Fordun, as to the guilt of Menteth, and afterwards refers to him in some additions of his own, as the acknowledged traitor who had seized Wallace. Vol. ii. pp. 229, 243. With these authors, Fordun, Wynton, and Bower, Hailes was in timately acquainted. He has, indeed, quoted the last of them, Bower, on the margin. He must have known that they were dead before the author of the Metrical Romance of Wallace was born. Annals, vol. i. p. 281. And yet he labours to persuade the reader that the tale of Wallace's capture by Menteth rests on the single and re spectable authority of Blind Harry 1 He has also remarked, that he has yet to learn that Menteth had ever any intercourse or friendship and familiarity with Wallace. Yet that Menteth acted in concert"], [462, "446 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. with Wallace, is proved by the following passage from Bower, pre served in the Relationes Araaldi Blair. \" In hoc ipso anno (1298) viz. 28 die mensis Augusti, Dominus Wallas Scoti\u00e6 custos, cum Johanne Grahame, et Johanne de Menteith, militibus necnon, Alexandro Scrymgeour, Constabulario vill\u00e6 de Dundee et vexilla rio Scoti\u00e6, cum quinquagentis militibus armatis, rebelles Gallovi dienses punierunt, qui Regis Angli\u00e6 et Cuminorum partibus sine aliquo jure steterunt.\"* Having given these authorities, all of them prior to Blind Harry, it is unnecessary to give the testimony of the more modern writers. The ancient writers prove incontestably that Sir John de Menteth, a Scottish baron, who had served along with and under Wallace against the English, deserted his country, swore homage to Edward, and employed a servant of Wallace to betray his master into his hands ; that he seized him in bed, and delivered him to Edward, by whom he was instantly tried, condemned, and hanged. It was natural that the voice of popular tradition should continue from cen tury to century, to execrate the memory of such a man. Whether Menteth was the intimate friend of Wallace, or what precise degree of familiarity existed between them, it is now not easy to determine \u2014nor is it of any consequence as to his guilt. Indeed it is impos sible to regard without a smile the weak and inconclusive evidence, if it deserves so grave a name, on which Hailes has founded what he calls his Apology for Menteth, which, after all, \u00abeems to be bor rowed from Carte, vol. ii. p. 289. Dr Lingard, in his History of England, vol. iii. pp. 328, 329, makes an artful attempt to diminish the reputation of Wallace. He remarks, that he suspects he owes his celebrity as much to his exe cution as to his exploits ; that of all the Scottish chieftains who de served and experienced the enmity of Edward, he alone perished on the gallows ; and that on this account his fate monopolised the sym pathy of his countrymen, who revered him as the martyr of their independence ; he represents the accounts of his strength, gallant ry, and patriotic efforts, as given by Scottish writers who lived a \u2022 Dr Jamieson, in his Notes on Wallace, p. 403, has ably combated the scepticism of Hailes as to Menteth. The above passage is quoted from the Re lationes Arnaldi Blair, and seems to have been a part of Bower's additions to Fordun."], [463, "447 NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. century or two after his death, and who therefore were of no credible authority ; and he concludes with a eulogy on the clemency of Ed- - ward, who did not forget the interests of Wallace, when the rest of his countrymen made their peace with England. All this is a tissue of error and misrepresentation. It is not true, that of all the Scottish - chieftains who deserved Edward's enmity, Wallace was the only one who perished on the gallows. Sir Nigel Bruce, Sir Christo pher Seton, John Seton, the Earl of Athol, Sir Simon Fraser, Sir Herbert de Morham, Thomas Boys, Sir David Inchmartin, * Sir John de Somerville, Sir Thomas and Sir Alexander Bruce, both brothers of the King, and Sir Reginald Crawfurd, were all banged by Edward's orders in the course of the year 1306, within a year of the execution of Wallace. So much for the accuracy of the ground on which Lingard hasi founded his conjecture, that Wallace owes his celebrity \" to his execution.\" His next remark is equally unfortunate. The writers who have given us an account of the exploits of Wallace did not live, as Lin gard imagines, a century or two after his death. John de For dun, whom the historian, in his note on p. 328, includes amongst these writers, was born some time after the conclusion of the reign of Alexander the III., who died in 1285. He certainly re ceived materials for his history from Bishop Wardlaw, who died in 1386. If we suppose that he began his history thirty years be fore ; and that he was thirty years old when he commenced wri ting, this will give us 1326 for the year of his birth. So that For dun was born twenty-one years after Wallace's execution. Even in the most favourable possible way in which the calculation can be taken, Fordun wrote his history only eighty-one years after Wal lace's execution ; and taking fifty as the average life, it will follow he was born only thirty-one years after that event. Wynton finished his history in 1418. He was born probably not more than fifty or sixty years after Wallace's death, and might have received his in formation from old men who had known him. As to his praise of the clemency of Edward towards Wallace, tbe unsubstantial grounds on which it is founded have been already noticed.f I cannot help f Page 440, note R. \u2022 See supra, 24T to 257, inclusive."], [464, "448 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. remarking that Lingard's whole account of Wallace is artfully and, as it appears to me, unfairly written. He begins, by throwing a doubt over his early history. \" Historians conjecture, \" he says, \"\u25a0 that Wallace was born at Paisley ; and they assert that his hos tility to the English originated more in the necessity of self-preser vation, than the love of his country. He had committed a murder, and fled from the pursuit of justice to the woods.\" Unfortunately for Lingard, historians assert the contrary. They assert that Wallace's hostility to the English arose from his despair at beholding the op pression of his relations and countrymen, and the servitude and misery to which they were subjected. \u2014 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 169. Wynton, vol. ii. p. 91. * He next observes, that after the surprise of Ormesby the Justi ciary, by Wallace and Douglas, other independent chieftains arose in different counties, who massacred the English, and compelled their own countrymen to fight under their standards. These other independent chieftains are brought in \" for the nonce \" by Dr Lin gard. They are utterly unknown to the contemporary historians, English or Scottish. But they do not appear upon the stage with out a use. On the contrary, they first multiply, like Falstaff's men in buckram, \" into numerous parties,\" and then act a prin cipal part in the next sentence ; for the historian goes on to ob serve, \" that the origin and progress of these numerous parties had been viewed with secret satisfaction by the Steward of Scotland and Wishart the Bishop of Glasgow, who determined to collect them into one body, and to give their efforts one common direc tion. Declaring themselves the assertors of Scottish independence, they invited the different leaders to rally around them, and the summons was obeyed by Wallace and Douglas, by Sir Alexander Lindsay, Sir Andrew Moray, and Sir Richard Lundy.\" Vol. iii. p. 305. This last sentence is one of pure and gratuitous invention, without a shadow of historical authority to support it. The numerous independent parties and chieftains who rose in different counties, the silent satisfaction with which they were contemplated by the Bishop of Glasgow and the High Steward, their determination to \u2022 I find I have been guilty of an inaccuracy in mixing up the skirmish at Lanark, which arose out of an insult offered to Wallace, with the attack and slaughter of Heslop the sheriff. 3"], [465, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 449 collect them into one body and to give them one common direction, their declaring themselves the assertors of Scottish independence, their summons to the different leaders to rally round them, and the prompt obedience of this summons by Wallace, Douglas, and the rest, are facts created by the ingenuity of the historian. They seem to be introduced for the purpose of diminishing the reputation of Wallace, and the impression they leave on the mind of the reader appears to me to be one totally different from the truth. The Steward and the Bishop of Glasgow are the patriot chiefs under whom Douglas, and Wallace, and many other independent chief tains consent to act for the recovery of Scottish freedom, and Wal lace sinks down into the humble partizan, whose talents are direct ed by their superior authority and wisdom. Now, the fact is exactly the reverse of this. The Steward and Wishart, encouraged by the successes of Wallace and Douglas, joined their party, and acted along with them in their attempt to free Scotland ; but neither Fordun, nor Wynton, nor Bower, gives us the slightest ground to think that they acted a principal part, or anything like a principal part, in organi zing the first rising against Edward. On the contrary, these his torians, along with Trivet and Walsingham, Tyrrel and Carte, ascribe the rising to Wallace alone, whose early success first caused him to be joined by Douglas, and afterwards by the Bishop and the Steward, along with Lindsay, Moray, and Lundy. Indeed, in stead of playing the part ascribed to them by Lingard, the patriot ism of the Steward and the Bishop was of that lukewarm and short* lived kind which little deserves the name. It did not outlive eight weeks, and they seized the first opportunity to desert Wallace and the cause of freedom. The attack upon Ormesby the Justiciary took place some time in May 1297, and on the 9th of July of the same year, did Bishop Wishart, this patriot assertor of Scottish independ ence, negotiate the treaty of Irvine by which he and the other Scot tish barons, with the single exception of Wallace and Sir Andrew Moray of Bothwell, submitted to Edward. Lingard's other hero, the High Steward, who is brought in to divide the glory with Wallace, was actually in the English service at the battle of Stir ling, and although he secretly favoured the Scottish cause, he did net openly join with his countrymen till he saw the entire de- VOL. I. 2 F"], [466, "HTSTORY OF SCOTLAND. 450 \u2022struction of Surrey's army. I may remark, in concluding this note; that the idea of an attack upon Wallace and an eulogy of the clemency of Edward, has probably not even the merit of originality. It appears to be borrowed from Carte, vol. ii. p. 290 ; but it is only the idea which is taken. The clumsy and absurd argument of Carte is discarded, and a far more ingenious hypothesis, with a new set of facts, is substituted in its place. On reading over Hemingford again, I find one expression which may perhaps have suggested this theory of Lingard. Hemingford says, speaking of Bruce, p. 120, that he joined the Bishop of Glasgow and the Steward \" qui tocius mali fabricators exstiterant.\" Yet this is inconsistent with his own account in p. 118, and is not corroborated, as far as I know, by any other historian. Letter V, page 233. A MS. in the Cottonian, Vitell. Axx, entitled \" Historia Angli\u00e6 a Bruto ad ami. 1348,\" has this passage : \" Anno 1306. Kal. Feb. Robertus de Brus ad regnum Scoti\u00e6 aspirans, nobilem virum, J. de Comyn, quod s\u00e6 prodttioni noluit assentire, in Ecclesia fratrum minorum de Dumfres interfecit ; et in festo annuntiationis Virginis, gloriose in Ecclesia Canonicorum regularium de Scone, per Comi tissam de Wohan, se fecit in regem Scoti\u00e6 solemniter coronari. Nam germanus predicte comitisse, cui hoc officium jure hereditario competebat, tune absens in Anglia morabatur. Hanc Comitissam eodeni anno Angli ceperunt, et in quadam domuncula h'gnea super murum Castri Berwyki posuerunt, ut earn possent conspicere trans euntes.\" The original order of Edward for the imprisonment of the Countess of Buchan is to be found in Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. ii. p. 1014. Lord Hailes treats the tale of the Countess of Buchan's criminal passion for Bruce with ridicule, and in this respect follows Abercromby, vol. i. p. 573, whose remarks upon this obscure story are exceedingly weak and trifling. If, however, we admit the fact, that the Countess of Buchan, whose brother was in the English in terest, and whose husband, according to the authentic and accurate historian Hemingford, vol. i. p. 221, sought to kill her for her trea son, did, alone and unaccompanied, repair to Scone, and there crown Robert Bruce, it seems to give some countenance to the"], [467, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 451 story of her entertaining a passion for the king. The circumstance that nothing of this second coronation is to be found in the Scottish historians, Barbour, Wynton, or Fordun, rather confirms than weak ens the suspicion. Letter W, page 246. \" Hanc autem Comitissam eodem anno ab Anglicis captam cum quidam perimere voluissent non permisit rex, sed in domuncula quadam lignea super muruin Castri Berewici posita est, ut possent earn transeuntes conspicere.\" Trivet, p. 342.\u2014 Lord Hailes, vol. ii. p. 10, has given an elaborate and anxious note, to prove the impos sibility of there being any truth in Math. Westminster's assertion, p. 455, \" that the countess was in open day suspended at Ber wick in a stone and iron chamber, formed like a crown, as a gaze to all passengers.\" He quotes the order preserved in the F\u0153dera, vol. ii. p. 1014, and then observes, that it is inconsistent with the story related by Math. Westminster. I confess that I can see no such inconsistency ; on the contrary, the one completely corro borating tbe other. The place of confinement, as described in the express words of Edward, is \" to be a cage constructed in one of tlte turrets of the castle of Berwick, latticed with wood, cross-bar red, and secured with iron, in which the Chamberlain of Scotland, or his deputy, shall put the Countess of Buchan.\" Lord Hailes observes, that \" to those who have no notion of any cage but one for a parrot, or a squirrel, hung out at a window, he despairs of rendering this mandate intelligible.\" I know not what called forth this peevish remark, but any one who has noticed the turrets of the ancient feudal castles, which hung like crowns, or cages, on the outside of the walls, and within one of which the countess's cage was to be constructed, will be at no loss to understand the tyranni cal directions.of Edward, and the passage of Mathew Westminster. It is impossible not to remark, that, in his text. Lord Hailes has wholly omitted to notice the severity of Edward the First to the Countess of Buchan, simply observing, that she was committed to close confinement in England, and characterising Edward's orders as being ridiculously minute. Dr Lingard, vol. iii. p. 377, softens the severity of Edward by a supposition which appears to me to be inconsistent with the tone and spirit of Edward's order."], [468, "452 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Letter X, page 248. We know by the evidence of a remission under the Great Seal, communicated by Mr Thomson, the Deputy-Clerk Register, to Dr Jamieson, that the delivery of Sir Christopher Seton to the Eng lish was imputed to Sir Gilbert de Carrie, but upon investigation not altogether justly, \" minus juste ut verius intelleximus ;\" and the same remission proves, that the castle of Lochdon was, by the same knight, Sir Gilbert de Carrie, delivered into the hands of the English. Mr Thomson considers the remission as showing for certain that Sir Christopher had taken refuge in the castle of Loch don, of which Sir Gilbert de Carrie was hereditary keeper ; but this is rather a strong inference than a certainty. The conjecture of the Statistical Account, vol. xi. No. 4, Parish of Urr, in favour of the castle of Loch Urr, seems to be supported by pretty plausible evi dence. Letter Y, page 251. Dr Lingard observes that some of them were murderers. I know not on what authority he uses the plural \" some of them.\" Sir Christopher de Seton, indeed, is represented by Hemingford, p. 219, as having slain Comyn's brother, Sir Robert ; and Trivet, p. 345, points to the same thing in the sentence, \" usque Dumfries ubi quindam militem de parte Regis occiderat ;\" but the authentic Scottish historians, Barbour and Fordun, say nothing of it ; and I suspect that all that can be proved against Seton, is the being pre sent with Robert Bruce when he stabbed Comyn. Indeed, one MS. of Trivet says, that Seton was condemned on account of a murder committed in a church with his consent. See Trivet, p. 345, and the various readings at the bottom. As to the others, I am not aware of a single act of murder which can be brought against them, on the authority either of English or of Scottish historians. The fealty sworn to Edward was extorted from them either by fetters, imprisonment, confiscation, or the fear of death. Letter Z, page 277. Lord Hailes has been misled by an error of Rymer, who has er-"], [469, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 453 roneously placed a deed entitled \" Gilbertus Comis Gloucestrie Capitaneus pro Expeditione Scoti\u00e6,\" on the 3d December 1309, instead of 1308. He conjectures, but on very slight grounds, that the siege was raised. We may, perhaps, infer the contrary, from the orders issued by Edward, on the 12th of May 1309, to most parts of England, and to Ireland also, to provide corn, malt, peas, beans, and wine, for his various castles in Scotland, and in the enu meration of these, Rutherglen is not included.

Forfar is also mentioned, in a document dated 3d Decem ber 1308 as being at that time in possession of the English. Letters AA, page 296. Hume has entirely mistaken the numbers of the English army who fought at Bannockburn, and has been corrected by Hailes, vol. i. p. 41. Lingard has remarked, that it is impossible to ascertain the exact numbers of Edward's army. He says the most powerful earls did not attend ; but he has omitted the important fact, that although they did not come in person, they sent their knights to lead their vassals into the field, and perform their wonted services. We may infer from this mention of the absence of the Earls of War wick, Surrey, Arundel, and Lancaster, that if any of the other ba rons or counties had neglected to send their powers, the same his torians would have noted the circumstance. The number given by Tyrrel, vol. iii. p. 260, is a hundred thousand men, and it is probable that this is rather under than above the fact. Letters BB, page 319.
