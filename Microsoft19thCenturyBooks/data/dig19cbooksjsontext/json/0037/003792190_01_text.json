Reader, I will not inflict upon you the penalty of preface or dedication, being fully persuaded that you would care for neither; and therefore if you are disposed to follow me to America, I will inform you at once, that after having seen the greater part of Europe, I went on board the packet, George Canning, on the 24th of March, 1831, and sailed from Liverpool for New York, with my note-book, sketch-book, gun, and fish ing rod\u2014 alone, unbewifed and unbevehicled, as VOL. I. B"], [14, "6 SIX MONTHS a man ought to travel, and with the determina tion of being, as far as an Englishman can be, unprejudiced ; and of seeing all I could of the United States in the space of about six months. Having said this, 1 beg of you to remember that I do not profess to tell you what may be seen in a year. I may be allowed to mention, that the George Canning is one of the best of the twenty-six packets that sail from Liverpool to different parts of North America. Every possible comfort and every reasonable luxury is at the command of the passenger ; and, whether he be confined to his state-room from the effects of sea-sickness, or indulging a most Atlantic appetite, and quaffing champagne to the memory of Columbus, he cannot fail at the end of his voyage to be loud in the praises of her excellent commander, Captain Allyn. We saw an ave rage number of young whales, but contrived to"], [15, "IN AMERICA. 7 miss the icebergs and the sea-serpent ; and after an excellent passage of twenty-three-days (the voyage from Liverpool, at this season of the year, being scarcely ever less than thirty), we sailed through the Narrows into the splendid bay of New York. The passage so named is about three quarters of a mile in width, and defended by four or five hundred pieces of cannon. The most prominent object is a dia mond-shaped fort, which appears to rise out of the water, and is called Fort La Fayette, because it fired its first salute in honour of that General, upon his arrival on the shores of America in 1824. The fort on the New Jersey side, as if in opposition to its French-named antagonist, is known by the very English name of Fort Tomkins. On the Long Island beach is seen New Utrecht, a small sea-bathing place, and cele- b2"], [16, "8 SIX MONTHS brated as the spot where the British troops, under the command of Sir Henry Clinton, were landed without opposition, previously to their attack of New York in 1776. Numerous vessels of different sizes that had been detained outside by contrary winds, were working their way through the Narrows at the same time, and presented a most animating spectacle. They were from all parts of the world ; the sun shone full upon their white sails; the broad bright pine-streak reddened beneath his declining rays, and added a characteristic elegance to the ap pearance of the American ships, which taken as a class, are certainly handsomer than those of any other nation. That the trim and figure of a British merchantman are usually inferior to those of America, is owing to the circumstance of there being no tonnage-duty in America; and therefore, their ships are constructed for"], [17, "9 IN AMERICA. the carriage of a given number of tons with the greatest speed ; but by the British method of rating their ships, a merchantman can be constructed so as to carry more than her legal tonnage without paying for it ; of which John Bull very property takes' advantage by swelling out his ships as much as, possible, so long as he can avoid the' liability of being charged at a higher rate. We had scarcely entered the bay when the wind dropped ; steam-boats were plying in all directions, and one of them coming alongside, I was glad to avail 'myself of her assistance, and arrived at New York before sunset. Within two minutes after I had landed I found myself in the Broadway, the principal street and pro menade in the city. At two o'clock on every fine day, all the fashion and too-gaily dressed beauty of New York are to be seen there. It"], [18, "10 SIX MONTHS contains the finest shops, and altogether has a very lively and city-like appearance, which, nevertheless, suffers considerably on account of the houses being mostly built of red brick. Its width, I should say, is about the same as that of Oxford-street ; in length it is, or rather will be when finished, about three miles. The courts of justice hold their sittings in the city hall, a large and handsome building of Massa chusetts white marble and brown free-stone, which stands in the centre of what is called the Park, a green open space on the side of the Broadway. The prison, a gloomyr-looking struc ture, is too conspicuous, and exceedingly handy, being so near to it that a \" ponte de 'i sospiri \" might be thrown across from one to the other with great effect. But it is not in the contemplation of the most refined and mag nificent works of art, that the European traveller"], [19, "IN AMERICA. 11 in the United States must expect to derive his principal gratification. The public buildings in New York for the different purposes of charity, education, and commerce, are very numerous; but there are none that can lay claim to his particular attention : in a few hours, with a little assistance from a cabriolet or an omnibus, he might see all that is worth his notice in the city, considered merely as a collection of build ings, containing 200,000 inhabitants. It is the extraordinary energy and urgency of commerce that will chiefly attract his attention. The wharfs on the North river are flanked by superb steam boats, daily and hourly employed in the convey ance of thousands ; those on the East river, by double and triple lines of the most beautiful merchantmen; while the three streets which run successively parallel to them might be taken for one enormous warehouse, the pavement being"], [20, "12 SIX MONTHS nearly blocked up with merchandise from every country, and exhibiting a rattling and somewhat dangerous confusion of carts and cranes, that is quite beyond a \" private gentleman's belief,\" till he has seen it. Although the actual numerical tonnag-e of the trade of New York is four times less than that of Liverpool, yet the appearance of bustle and business is far more striking at New York : the reason is, that there is so much more retail trade carried on in the latter city than in Liverpool, or any other city in the world. Innumerable boats descend the North river, laden with timber, or live and dead stock, and provisions for the markets of New York, and carry back a petty and varied cargo of wearing apparel and other necessaries that are wanted in the interior. Although Philadelphia is a larger place, the balance of trade between New York and that"], [21, "13 IN AMERICA. city is usually, if not always, in favour of New York. Imported goods sold at Philadelphia, on account of the New York merchants, are paid for in bills made payable at Philadelphia. The banks at New York discount these bills, which as they become due are satisfied on demand by payment in specie ; so that there is a constant flow of hard dollars from Philadelphia to New York. In order to see the city in perfection, the North river must be crossed, and a fine view is obtained from any of the rising grounds on the opposite bank. But to include a distant view of the city and the bay in the same drawing, I should recommend a station on Staten Island, or on the opposite heights about Gowanus. On this head the British public will soon be satisfied. Before I quitted America, I was favoured with a sight of the most exact and"], [22, "14 SIX MONTHS admirable drawings to be used as materials for the next view at the Colosseum in the Regent's Park, which I understood was to be that of New York and its environs. It is singular that, as in London, they should all have been taken from the top of St. Paul's church. Unless I were anxious to write either an almanack or a guide book, I think I need not here say more about New York ; reserving for another place any remarks that apply generally to one city as well as another. I will merely add, that I should strongly recommend every one to visit the Mu seum before he commences a tour ; and that the city contains two excellent theatres, of which that in the Park is the more fashionable : I heard the English version ofthe \" Cenerentola \" performed in very good style : I was delighted with the singing of our countrywoman, Mrs. Austin, and I laughed heartily at the drolleries"], [23, "15 IN AMERICA. of Mr. Hackett, who is an unrivalled mimic of the eccentricities of his countrymen. An Italian opera is confidently expected by the next season. At present the first society in New York, which is very good, is seldom to be seen at the theatre. In my ignorance, I was very much astonished the first evening I went there, at seeing a mul titude of persons, who would have thought it a gross mistake not to have been taken for gentle men, sitting occasionally in the front and almost always in the back seats of the dress circle, with their hats on, in the presence of ladies, wiio w7ere scattered in different parts of the same box. Nowr, New York, if not the most refined, is certainly, strictly speaking, the most fashionable place in the Union, and it is not to be wondered at, that foreigners who have just landed from Europe and who very probably go to the theatre on the first evening of their arrival, should"], [24, "16 SIX MONTHS thence imbibe strange and unjust ideas of the best American manners. I have heard that com mon sense is the characteristic of the Americans ; and I think there is great truth in the remark ; but I do not like it when it is so very common. These republican De Courcys are very fond of wearing their hats : I never was at church in the United States, without observing individuals (I do not say many), who would evidently have been very sorry to have been thought guilty of any impropriety, putting their hats on when the service was over, in the very body of the church. These are no trifles when considered as part of the national manners. But in the United States there is no standard for manners : their political independence is oftentimes impercept ibly identified with independence of behaviour that procures for individuals an unfavourable opinion, of which the men and their minds are alike unworthy."], [25, "IN AMERICA. 17 It was the twenty-third of April, St. George's clay, when I left New York to commence my tour ; the members of the St. George's Society wTere going to dine together, and the huge banner of the saint was waving from one of the upper windows of the City-hotel, as I emerged from the gloomy recesses, in enormous establishments ycleped single-bedded rooms, and proceeded to the wharf where the New Brunswick steamers are to be found, and where it is coolly and most intelligibly intimated to the traveller, in very large letters, that he can have \" Transportation to Philadelphia,\" at a very trifling expense. These steam-boats are necessarily very large ; being frequently destined to carry three or even four hundred passengers : they are constructed in the best manner for obtaining the greatest proportionate space and a free circulation of air. They may fairly be said to be three-deckers."], [26, "18 SIX MONTHS The working-beam is usually placed at a great height above the upper-deck, and the whole of the engine is so much raised that no incon venience arises from the heat of the boilers. When one of these steamers is seen approaching from a distance, the confusion of green and white galleries gives it very much the appearance of a moving summer-house. The rapidity with which we moved across the bay procured me a constant change of scene : the banks were dotted with small villages, but I observed but few gen tlemen's seats. At a distance, on the right, stands the town of NewTark, a considerable place, discernible by its white steeples. We passed Perth Amboy at the mouth of the Rariton river : the first British settlement in New Jersey. The governor's house, the picquet and guard house, can be seen from the river. The go vernor's house resembles a Gloucestershire spin-"], [27, "19 IN AMERICA. ning mill. I was landed at New Brunswick, where I foimd conveyances awaiting the arrival of the steamer in order to carry its passengers across the country to Bordentown. Notwith standing that this road is one of the prin cipal thoroughfares between New York and Philadelphia, yet I was fairly and quickly jolted into the conviction that although it was probable I should travel over many that were as bad, yet that I could not by any possibility find one that was worse. Allowances are to be made for the roads I afterwards saw, in the back settlements ; but the condition of this one was really disgrace ful. There was a great deal of wood on every side ; but it can hardly be called forest, being what is here termed second-growth wood. A great part of these lands had been cleared by the earlier settlers, but were allowed to remain uncultivated, and to be overgrown whenever a"], [28, "20 SIX MONTHS soil of greater fertility and sufficiently protected, was discovered in the interior of the country. Bordentown, is a small, but neat and pretty, village on the banks of the Delaware. On the outskirts is a large and rather irregular brick building at the extremity of a court-yard, which is flanked by stabling and other outhouses, with extensive gardens and pleasure grounds behind them, laid out a 1' Anglais. This is the residence of the Count Survilliers, better knowTi, in England at least, as Joseph Buonaparte. I was provided with an introduction to his Excellency, and paid him a morning visit. His reception of me was exceedingly courteous. The instant he appeared, I was most forcibly struck with the very strong resemblance he bore to the later portraits of Napoleon. His person, I should say, was rather larger; the expression of the eye was -the same, though more subdued; the same hair, the"], [29, "IN AMERICA. 21 same shaped head, and the same contour of feature generally, with a darker complexion, and a good set of teeth. I should say, the principal difference was observable in the mouth, which seemed more inclinable to the jocose than the sanguinary. After some conversation, which was carried on in French, and turned chiefly on the subject of European travel, his Excellency showed me his pictures, which are numerous and interesting. He has several fine Murillos, and a most beautiful Madonna by Vandyke. He has many portraits of his own family; among these is one of Napoleon in his coronation robes, and the well-known picture of the First Consul on horseback, crossing the Alps. I felt an emotion which I will not attempt to describe, when, as we passed round the room, he paused before the latter picture, and drew my attention to it, remarking that it was the original, by David. The cabinet vol. i. c"], [30, "22 SIX MONTHS of statues and mosaics is also very fine, and the collection altogether by far the best in America. His Excellency occasionally mixes in society both at New York and Philadelphia, and talks without reserve of his former situation, \" Quand j' etais roi d' Espagne.\" \" Dans mes belles affaires,\" are occasionally introduced in his con versation. By his advice I subsequently mounted the observatory in his grounds. Thence I en joyed a very fine view of the country on the opposite side of the Delaware, whose broad and rapid stream was flowing beneath me; on the left, the river seemed to lose itself among the distant woods of Pennsylvania; on the right, at a distance of about six miles, is Trenton, made notorious by the daring passage of the Delaware, and the subsequent defeat and cap ture, of a body of Hessians, by General Wash ington, on the night of the 25th of December,"], [31, "IN AMERICA. 23 1776, during a violent storm, and when the danger of the revolutionists was at its crisis. Bordentown is about twenty-six miles from Philadelphia. The next day I proceeded to that city in a steam-boat, which stopped for passengers at every considerable village on the well-wooded, but flat and uninteresting, banks of the river. At length Philadelphia makes its appearance, stretching for nearly three miles along the western side of a bend or angle of the river. This view is certainly a fine one, but it would be much improved by the appear ance of a few more steeples or lofty structures. From the water twro or three only are visible above this immense assemblage of red houses ; and yet the city contains nine episcopal churches, a great number of public buildings, and charit able institutions without end. Great attention is paid to the education of c2"], [32, "24 SIX MONTHS the poorer classes : the constitution of Pennsyl vania declaring, \" That the legislature shall, as soon as convenient, provide by law for the establishment of schools, in such manner that the poor may be educated without expense. \" Philadelphia has been often described. The streets cross each other at right angles : those running parallel with the river are numbered, second, third, fourth, &c. ; the others usually bear the name of some fruit or tree. The word street is usually omitted : in describing the way, a person would tell yrou that the place you were looking for was in Walnut, below fifth ; Sassafras, above second; Mulberry, between seventh and eighth, &c. These streets run over a distance of two miles, from the Delaware to the Schuyllkill river, which enters the Delaware about nine miles to the south of Philadelphia. The Bank of Pennsylvania is a small building,"], [33, "25 IN AMERICA. but elegantly designed from the Temple of the Muses, on the Ilyssus, near Athens. The new Mint of the United States was unfinished, but promised to be a chaste and beautiful building, on a larger scale, from the same model. On the 4th of July, 1776, the Declaration of Independence was signed, and afterwards read from the steps of the State house, where the state courts of justice are now held. The room in which this took place had been fitted up for La Fayette in 1824, as the most appropriate place for levee tenure ; but when I saw it, it was occupied by workmen, who had instructions to replace every thing as it was when it acquired its present reputation. The Academy of Fine Arts much exceeded my expectations. Although the most conspi cuous pictures were those of American academi cians, yet here and there the eye was attracted"], [34, "\u25a020 SIX MONTHS by a Vandyke, a Rubens, a Guercino, and a Salvator Rosa, or some good copies from them. There were a few landscapes by Ruysdael, and a fine Murillo : the subject was the Roman daughter. The productions from the English school, were portraits of John H. Powell, Esq. by Sir Thomas Lawrence, of John Kemble by Sir M. A. Shee, and another of Dugald Stuart by Sir H. Raeburn. Any person conversant with the pictures of this latter artist, would have recognised this, by the usual green colouring in the back-ground. There were five admirable portraits by Mr. Stewart, the American artist, of the Presidents Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe. The best full-length portrait of Washington is that in the Fauneuil Hall at Boston ; but as a half-length this is, I believe, considered the original. They were all remarkable for their easy and unsophisticated"], [35, "27 IN AMERICA. attitudes. Mr. Stewart has been dead about five years. Mr. Hardinge has also very great merit as a portrait painter; but Mr. Sully has the reputation of being the first in America. A portrait of Sir Thomas LawTence, by that gen tleman, is a most successful imitation of the style of the late president. He exhibited also an excellent full-length portrait of General La Fayette ; and Mr. Tuman, a scarcely inferior artist, is at present employed in painting an other, of Mr. Penn, which will occupy a place beside the General in the Hall of Independence. I also observed a composition-landscape, by Mr. Fisher, which had very great merit. It was well remarked in the preface to the catalogue, that so many of the pictures did not need indulgence, in comparison with that which had heretofore been cheerfully, and with justice, conceded to them. This was very true of a large proportion"], [36, "28 SIX MONTHS of them, but some nevertheless, needed it not a little ; and in fact had no business there. It is a pity that the Americans do not take warning by the constant outcry that for so many years has been justly raised against the swarm of portraits that annually cluster on the walls of Somerset-house. They might well devote more of their time and talent to historical painting. With the exception of the \" Sortie from Gib raltar,\" by Colonel Trumbull, and another very indifferent picture, there were, I think, no his torical pieces in the room appropriated to modern events. The Americans cannot plead a want of subjects : the revolution is not half illustrated ; besides, they may depend upon it, portrait painting is a very aristocratical thing after all, and should not be generally encou raged, on that account. In running over the walls of a modern exhibition-room, the eye is"], [37, "IN AMERICA. 29 fatigued by its endeavours to avoid an encounter with the features of individuals in a new cha racter, to which many of them never had the slightest pretensions, except upon canvass. The water-works on the Schuyllkill are pro bably the finest in the world: they can scarcely be praised too highly for beauty of design, simplicity of construction, and real usefulness. A dam, sixteen hundred feet in length, is thrown across the river, by which the stream is backed up for several miles, and an enormous water-power thus created. The solid rock has been excavated, in order to obtain what is termed a race ; and by means of huge double forcing pumps, worked by four immense wheels, the water is thrown up into an ample reservoir, fifty-six feet above the highest ground in the city. It is calculated that each wheel and pump could raise one million two hundred and fiftv"], [38, "30 SIX MONTHS thousand gallons in twenty-four hours, if allowed to play without intermission. The rising ground in the neighbourhood of the water-works affords the best and nearest general view of the city. Thence I visited the botanical gardens of Mr. Pratt, containing a very fine orangery and a choice collection of exotics, and delightfully situated on the east side of the Schuyllkill, which spreads out to a great extent immediately be neath them, with banks wooded to the water's edge. In a very few years this fine scene is destined to be unnatured. By this time a rail road is commenced, which will run from Phila delphia to Columbia, a distance of eighty-two miles : it will there join the great Pennsyl vanian canal, which has been finished nearly all the way from the eastern side of the Alleghany mountains. In order to pass these, a rail-road on inclined planes, will be constructed ; by"], [39, "31 IN AMERICA. which the rich mineral productions on the western slope of the mountains, consisting chiefly of iron and bituminous coal of the finest quality, will be quickly forwarded to Philadel phia in any quantity. The greatest height of the Alleghany mountains in Pennsylvania, is thirteen hundred feet. The rail-road I have mentioned, will pass at a short distance from the water-works ; and therefore, in all probability, no very long period will elapse before the vicinity will become a coal-yard. The porcelain manufactory is not far off. I was told that the material was little inferior to that of Sevres, but I found the painting indifferent. French China is still preferred, and superiority cannot yet be expected in this department. In my way back to the city, I visited the Penitentiary of Pennsylvania. This is the most"], [40, "32 SIX MONTHS extensive building in the United States. The front is 670 feet in length \u2014 very handsome, and bearing a baronial and gloomy appearance, in the style of our old English castles. Its area is a square, with a tower at each angle of the prison wall. It is intended that eight corridors should radiate from an observatory in the centre of the area, but only three are in use at pre sent. These contain the cells, and command a free circulation of air, and a plentiful supply of water. The only punishment adopted, is solitary confinement. This Penitentiary is too young an establishment to afford a perfect con fidence in the opinions of those who are favour able to its system. The reports of the inspectors are, however, extremely encouraging. The first and present warder (Mr. Samuel R. Wood) was only appointed in June 1829. This gentle man, who is well known as a kind of second"], [41, "IN AMERICA. 33 Howard in his way, has visited many of the prin cipal prisons in Europe; and now finds employ ment for his talents and his humanity in, I believe, his native city. Every crime committed in the state of Pennsylvania, on this side of the Alleghany mountains, that is punishable by im prisonment at all for the space of one year or more, is to be expiated by solitary confinement within this Penitentiary. That at Pittsburg, on the Ohio, receives those whose crimes are committed on the western side of the Alleghany. Every prisoner is allowTed to work at his trade ; or if he have none, or one that he cannot follow in his cell, he is allowed to choose one, and is instructed by one of the overseers, who are all masters of different trades. Mr. Wood, in his last report, gives it as his opinion, that a prisoner who has two years or upwards to remain in prison, can, in his solitary cell, earn sufficient to clear all his"], [42, "34 SIX MONTHS expenses from his admission till his discharge. The Philadelphia system differs from that at Sing-sing, in the state of New York. At Sing sing, the prisoners are brought out to work together, but are not allowed to speak to each other. At Philadelphia they never work toge ther; and from the time of his admission, one prisoner never sees, or speaks with, another. My English ideas were not a little startled at first, when I found that high treason is expiable by solitary confinement for not less than three, nor more than six years; and that the punishment for the second offence was solitary confinement for ten years. Treason against the state of Penn sylvania is here alluded to. By the articles of the constitution, treason against the United States shall consist only in levying war against them ; or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted of"], [43, "IN AMERICA. 35 treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court. Congress shall have powrer to declare the punishment of treason, but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture, except during the life of the person attainted. Treason against the United States is a capital offence. Murder, in the second degree, that is, murder committed in a sudden quarrel, but with out malice prepense, is punished by solitary confinement at labour for three, and not more than six years; for the second offence, for a period not exceeding ten years. The punishment for burglary is solitary confinement for not less than two, nor more than ten years; for the second offence, for a period not exceeding fifteen years. For robbery, or being accessory thereto before the fact, the period is for not less than one, nor more than seven years; for the second offence, fora"], [44, "36 SIX MONTHS period not exceeding twelve years. Mayhem, kidnapping, horsestealing, perjury, &c. are all punished by solitary confinement for different periods. Almost every species of forgery, or aiding, abetting, or commanding the perpetration of a forgery, whether it be of the coin of the state, or have reference to the sale, utterance, or deli very, or having in possession the metallic plate used in the forging of any note of any bank incor porated in the state of Pennsylvania; or forging, defacing, corrupting, or embezzling any charters, gifts, grants, bonds, bills, wills, conveyances, or contracts; or defacing, or falsifying any enrol ment, registry, or record; or forging any entry of the acknowledgment, certificate, or endorse ment, whereby the freehold or inheritance of any person or persons may be charged; or of counterfeiting the hand or seal of another with intent to defraud; or the privy or great seal of"], [45, "IN AMERICA. 37 the state of Pennsylvania, is punished with solitary confinement for a period of not less than one, nor more than seven years ; and for the second offence, for a period not exceeding ten years. It is expected that few offenders will run the risk of solitary confinement for a second time. When first received, the prisoner is left alone, and it seldom happens that he does not ask for a Bible, and work, after the lapse of a few hours. A Bible and a few other religious books are allowed him. In a few days the with drawal of his employment is felt, and adopted as a punishment, with the most obstinate and hardened. The chaplain occasionally visits the prisoners, and on Sundays he takes a station whence the words of prayer and exhortation can be heard by every prisoner in his cell, as they echo along the vaulted roof of the corridor. VOL. I. d"], [46, "38 SIX MONTHS If any punishment can be said to be dig nified, that of solitary confinement has a claim to that epithet. Justice to society is nobly done, not only in the removal of the prisoner in the first instance, but, secondly, by enabling him to return, as it were, to the world, a wiser and a better man. The end of solitary confinement is the reformation of the criminal, by obliging him to think who never thought before. If reflection can be awakened, and conscience can obtain a hearing, its advantages will be readily acknowledged. The prisoner is forced to commune with his own soul : the all powerful voice of ridicule is absent and unheard; remorse is not stifled, and penitence is not put to flight, by the sneers of a dissolute companion : with no one to admire, and applaud his resolu tion to be \" game \" \u2014 to submit, is the only alternative."], [47, "39 IN AMERICA. In England the system could not, generally, I think, succeed. The effect of solitary confine ment might be the same on the moral character of the prisoner, but unless something like a per manent means of getting a livelihood be secured to him, after his removal from the prison, the principal and best object of the punishment would not be obtained. This would be ex tremely difficult in a country of small extent, with a superabundant population, and a supply of labour far exceeding the demand. The regenerated offender might, perhaps, contrive to avoid observation ; but if necessity compelled him to labour for his subsistence, it is probable that he would not find employment ; and the necessary consequence would be, that all his good resolutions would vanish at the approach of want. No country is so well adapted for the expe- d2"], [48, "40 SIX MONTHS riment as the United States of America. En terprise is abroad in every direction, and labour is well paid. When the period of confinement is at an end, the criminal may wander to any corner of that vast continent, \u2014 and go where he will, the wages of industry are always at his command. He is in little fear of being recog nised by his fellow-prisoners, because no pri soner is allowed to see another. His former associates in crime are dispersed, or in prison, or in the grave ; and the hope that attended him in his cell is realised, by the facility of gaining a new character, and friends who are ignorant of his crime. It should be added to this notice of the Penitentiary, that every cell opens into a small paved court-yard, in which the prisoner can take exercise ; and that the system has not been found prejudicial to health of mind or body, as had been anticipated."], [49, "41 IN AMERICA. I visited the Museum at Philadelphia, which is said to be the best in the United States. It contains a skeleton of the mammoth ; a fine collection of Indian curiosities and American animals : the most extraordinary of these is, perhaps, a specimen of the gigantic raya or ray, or devil-fish, measuring twelve feet in length, by fifteen in breadth ; and weighing more than 2000 Ibs. In the gallery are arranged a number of portraits, chiefly of distinguished Americans, which are said to be admirable likenesses ; but certainly not valuable as paintings. I was much better pleased altogether with the museum belonging to the Academy of Natural Sciences. It is much smaller than the other, but far more scientifically arranged. The Dock-yard at Philadelphia contained, when I visited it, a sixty-gun frigate, nearly finished; and the Pennsylvania, a four decker."], [50, "42 SIX MONTHS with a round stern, also in an unfinished state, and destined to carry one hundred and forty-four guns. This enormous vessel is two hundred and twenty feet in length, and fifty-eight across the main-beam. Her timbers seemed light, in proportion to her immense size ; they certainly do not appear to be thicker than those of an ordinary British seventy-four. The great strength of the knees, however, are said to compensate for the apparent weakness of her other timbers. There were no workmen em ployed upon her, and saltpetre was strewed over her wherever it would lie. She is larger than the old Santissima Trinidad, destroyed at Trafalgar; but not so large as a Turkish ship of the line, launched, I believe, since the battle of Navarino. All the guns of the Pennsylvania will be thirty-two-pound carronades on the spar-deck, and long guns on the others. Her"], [51, "43 IN AMERICA. anchor weighs more than 11,000 Ibs. With such a tremendous weight of metal, it is probable that she would not be able to stand the wear and tear of the long blockades in which many of our ships were employed during the war. The timber of the live-oak, so called from its being an evergreen, is supposed to be impe rishable. This tree grows almost exclusively in the Southern States ; but is annually be coming more scarce and valuable, as the extreme slowness of its growth cannot keep pace with the demand: the Americans will probably find themselves obliged to plant it, before another quarter of a century has elapsed. The following treatment of the different kinds of timber used in the American navy is recommended in the report of the Secretary of the Navy for 1829. Live-oak should be immersed for twelve months in water, then"], [52, "44 SIX MONTHS taken up and placed under cover to protect it against sun, rain, and high winds. Its im mersion is recommended by the fact that it renders it less liable to split. White-oak which is inferior to the British white, or navy-oak, should be docked about eighteen months in fresh, or two years in salt water ; then taken up and sawed into such sizes as may be required, then placed under cover for about two or three years. Yellow pine should be docked about twelve months ; then taken up, sawed, and covered for two years. Mast timber should be immersed and covered in mud till wanted for use. All timber ought to be cut when the greatest portion of sap is in circulation, at some time from the first of November to the end of February ; it should then be immersed in water, and never taken out but early in the spring: and it was given as an opinion, that"], [53, "45 IN AMERICA. if all timber underwent this process, the ships might last double the time they otherwise would. I went to both the principal theatres, but did not think that either they or the perform ances were as good as at New York. I saw Mr. Cooper, the famed American actor, in some old play, of which I forget the name. His voice is extremely good : I remember that I thought him dignified, but rather stiff, without however being the least awkward in his acting. I also saw young Burke, as Doctor Pangloss. His acting I thought admirable, and most humour ous ; and his violin playing is quite extraor dinary for his age. His tragedy is very little inferior to his comedy. The United States' bank at Philadelphia is a beautiful building, being a copy from the Parthe-"], [54, "46 SIX MONTHS non, with such alterations as were absolutely indispensable in order to render it fit for pur poses of business. It has no side columns ; but the portico is a splendid specimen of the Doric. The Ionic pillars in the interior, were brought from Italy. The present United States' bank, was incorporated by Act of Congress on the 10th of April, 1816, and is chartered till the 3d of March, 1836. It paid a bonus to Government of 1,500,000 dollars. Its capital is 35,000,000 dollars, divided into 350,000 shares of 100 dol lars each; 70,000 shares were subscribed by government, which therefore became a proprietor of one fifth. After a thorough investigation of the right of Congress to pass an act of incorpo ration, this bank was first called into existence in the year 1791, when General Washington was president; and its charter expired in the year 1811. The two opposing parties of Federalist"], [55, "IN AMERICA. 47 and Democrat had in effect began to show them selves, though not exactly by those names, in 1787. In 1790, Mr. Hamilton, the secretary of the treasury, made his celebrated report on the state of the public debts contracted during the revolutionary war. He proposed that the debts ofthe continental Congress and those incurred by the States individually, should be funded by the general government, and that the interest should be paid by taxes on articles of luxury and on ardent spirits. This, it was thought, would give too much power to the Federal government, in opposition to the rights of the States separately considered ; and it was on account of their con flicting opinions respecting this federal measure, that the two parties who supported or opposed the new constitution, first acquired the names of Federalist and Democrat. Their first differences under these appellations, were on the bank ques-"], [56, "48 SIX MONTHS tion, which afterwards became, and is now to a certain extent, a test of political principle. Its establishment had been opposed on constitutional grounds by Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Madison ; by the former in the executive cabinet, and by the latter in congress, and both distinguished Demo crats. It was asserted that congress had no power to create corporations. The Federalist was in favour of a liberal construction of the articles of the constitution, and an extension of the powers thereby vested in the federal assembly or congress of the United States, in opposition to what are termed state rights, or powers claimed separately by the states in their individual capacity. The federalist wras said to be friendly to Great Britain, and to be indifferent to the principles of the French revolution. He was in favour of the Aben law, by which the president was enabled to compel"], [57, "IN AMERICA. 49 suspected foreigners to leave the country ; and of the Sedition law, which provided for the prosecution and punishment of false and ma licious accusations against the president and members of congress. In fact, these measures were passed by congress during the adminis tration of John Adams, who succeeded General Washington, and was the second and last of the federal party elected to the office of president. The democrat regarded the princi ples of the federalist as far too aristocratical for the atmosphere of America. He was a strict interpreter of the articles of the constitu tion, and kept a careful watch, lest the federal government, in its united capacity, should usurp any powers which he considered as the rights and privileges of individual states. Under the overwhelming influence of the democrat principles, which have been on the increase"], [58, "50 SIX MONTHS more and more from the first year of Mr. Jefferson's presidency, the- federabst party have experienced a great decrease in number, and their principles have lost much of their rigidity. In fact, the two parties may be said to be nearly extinct, even in name ; the terms Federabst and Democrat being rarely mentioned now. The federalist was always the enemy of universal suffrage. He was for imposing a substantial quabfication on every voter; on the principle that property, and not persons, should be represented. In Pennsylvania for instance, the right of suffrage is possessed by every free man of the age of twenty-one years, who has resided in the state for two years next preced ing, and who within that time, has paid a state or county tax, assessed at least six months before the election : and a poll tax of fifty cents, per annum, confers this right upon individuals who"], [59, "51 IN AMERICA. are not in circumstances to pay any other. That corruption to a great extent is generated by this system, is admitted on all hands ; it is obviously a matter of course that it should be so. Even in democratic America there are to be found thousands who readily acknowledge the real causes of their prosperity to be iden tified with those that have prevented this system from figuring in its real colours ; and who freely admit that it proceeds from a comparative exemption from taxes; an unbounded extent of country; an admirable spirit of enterprise; a population not too large, and a consequent abundance of employment \u2014 not from the exist ence of a peculiar political system. But to return to the subject of the United States' bank. When Mr. Jefferson and the democrats came into power, the renewal of the bank charter was discussed as a party question."], [60, "52 SIX MONTHS At this period excitement was at its height ; and the federalists made themselves so con spicuous by their indiscriminating opposition to those measures of commercial restriction adopted by the democrats in power, against Great Britain, in compbance with the policy of the new French government, that they were considered by a large proportion of the Ameri can nation, as the apologists for the conduct of a country already regarded in the light of a public enemy. Yet such was the general opinion of the good that had been diffused throughout the Union by the bank, that the question of the renewal of its charter, was only lost by the casting vote of the president of the senate, and by one vote in the house of representatives. In less than three years after the expiration of the charter in 1811, the war with Great Britain having taken place"], [61, "53 IN AMERICA. in the mean time, the finances were in a state of incredible embarrassment; and the re-establish ment of the United States' bank recommended by Mr. Dallas, who was then secretary to the treasury, received the sanction of Mr. Madison ; and the measure passed both branches of con gress during the ascendency of that very party which was previously opposed to it. In consequence ofthe non-renewal ofthe bank charter, bank credit to the amount of 15,000,000 of dollars wras withdrawn from the pubbc ser vice, and a number of local banks immediately sprang up. Freed from the salutary control of the United States' bank, they commenced a system of imprudent trading, and excessive issues, which speedily disordered the currency of the country; and notwithstanding all her resources, and all her patriotism, in the last year of the VOL. I. e"], [62, "54 SIX MONTHS last war, the United States were on the eve of bankruptcy, solely for the want of some national institution that would have assisted the exigences of government, and supported a cir culating medium of general credit throughout the Union. The loss of the United States during the three years when there was no bank, was estimated at not less than 46,000,000 of dollars, sustained exclusively by want of a sound currency and an efficient system of finance. The United States' bank has estabbshed branch banks at twenty-two of the principal commercial cities of the Union. When it was first opened there were, as we have seen, but two parties in the country, both acting from motives purely patriotic. The number is now increased, and interest is not now, as it was then, left out of the question. The bank charter does not expire till 1836; but the sen-"], [63, "IN AMERICA. 55 timents of the president on the subject of its renewal, which so deeply involves the commer cial happiness of the Union, cannot but be speculated upon with peculiar interest, even at this distance of time. It is said that General Jackson is unfavour able to its renewal. In his message of 1830 he expressed an opinion, that the bank had failed in the great end of establishing an uniform and sound currency. This is supposed to have re ference merely to the circumstance of the bank, not in all cases redeeming the bills issued by any one of its branches indiscriminately at all the others. But it would be an obvious injus tice to oblige the bank to any such measure : the attempt would be quite incompatible with its existence ; as it is evident, that if the ex change were unfavourable in one State, and favourable in another, the flow of notes from e2"], [64, "56 SIX MONTHS the State where it is unfavourable, would soon suspend or contract all the operations of the bank ; and the very evil of an inequabty of the currency, which the establishment was designed to remedy, w7ould be increased by a vain attempt to perform impossibilities. I need not, how ever, pursue this subject further; but will only add, that all reasoning and experience seem to favour a bebef in the advantages which the banking establishment has conferred on the country. It is, besides, in possession of a consi derable surplus fund, after deducting seven per cent., which will enable it to meet any contin gences that may arise. In lieu of the United States' bank, an establishment to be termed a national bank, founded on the credit of the government and its revenues, has been proposed by General Jackson and others. Five hundred agents are employed at the present moment in"], [65, "57 IN AMERICA. transacting the affairs of the United States' bank ; but the enormous increase of patronage which would accrue to the government by the establish ment of the proposed National bank, would be nothing in comparison with the power that would be vested in it, from its having under its control the dispensation of bank accommodations to the amount of at least 50,000,000 of dollars. When these consequences are considered, it is difficult to conceive how such a plan could find support among the subjects of a government professing to be thoroughly democratical. The society of Philadelphia is, taken all together, the best in the United States. The gay season is during the winter months. Balls and concerts are then frequent and well attended: in this respect I was imfortunate, as I was in that city in May \u2014 but I was partly recompensed for my loss, by the promenade in Washington"], [66, "58 SIX MONTHS Square, which, although shady enough, and prettily laid out, is not what the most fashion ble promenade in Philadelphia ought to be ; \u2014 and I could not but remark, that the display of beauty and elegance to be seen there about six o'clock on the afternoon of a fine day, was most richly deserving of a better place of parade. I cannot in conscience assert that, as far as it went, I thought it equal, and yet I am scarcely willing to pronounce it inferior, to the splendid cortege of Kensington gardens. I had come to the conclusion that I should not be able to descend the Mississippi to New Orleans. By the time that I should arrive there, the extreme heats of an American summer would have been prevailing in that very un healthy climate, and a stranger is almost certain"], [67, "59 IN AMERICA. to be attacked by fever and ague. The voyage down the river occupies five or six clays ; the voyrage up the river is not performed in less than ten or twelve ; and I was consoled by learning that the voyage is exceedingly tedious, as the low banks offer no variety of scenery for many days \u2014 so much so, that upon rising in the morning, a person might almost be persuaded he had not moved from that part of the river where he had been the previous evening. I therefore determined to make a tour through part of Pennsylvania: I had heard much of the beauty of the scenery, of the trout fishing, and \" all that,\" and accordingly having engaged a place in the coach to Harrisburg, the capital of the State, I started by it, at the nondescript hour of two in the morning, and arrived at Harrisburg the same evening. The road lay through a well-cultivated, but not par-"], [68, "60 SIX MONTHS ticularly interesting country ; at least I did not think so, for it rained in torrents the whole morning ; and although I was inside the coach, one arm was completely wet through, in conse quence of the oilskin panels being but loosely fastened. The great heat of summer renders it necessary that the conveyances should be as airy as possible ; the panels, which are made either of leather or oilskin, are rolled up in dry weather ; but the \" gentleman in the corner \" sometimes comes off very badly on a cold or rainy day. In addition to this, it must be remembered that the American coaches usually carry nine inside, and do not afford too much liberty to the legs. The three passengers who sit in the middle, lean their shoulders against a broad leather strap, which passes across the coach ; and as this occasionally gets unhooked in passing over a forest road, their heads are"], [69, "61 IN AMERICA. instantly thrown in contact with the stomachs of those who are behind them. The most considerable place we passed was Reading, which has much the appearance of a second-rate country town in England. Viewed from the Sunbury road, by which I returned to it in my way back to Philadelphia, its situation, in a fine surrounding country, appears to much greater advantage. We passed no other place of note but Lebanon ; in the vicinity of which is to be found some of the finest arable land in Pennsylvania. Harrisburg is delightfully situated on the Susquehanna. It was here for the first time I saw that beautiful river ; in breadth about three quarters of a mile. Its clear and shallow stream is not really slow, but at a little distance it appears as tranquil and unruffled as the sur face of a lake. Immediately opposite to Harris burg is an island, from either side of which a"], [70, "62 SIX MONTHS long wooden bridge is thrown -to the opposite bank of the river. Harrisburg is the capital of Pennsylvania, and is a thriving, neat and pretty looking town, containing about four thousand inhabitants. The House of Assembly, or Capi tol, as it is always called in America, is built on an eminence. The sittings of the senate and house of representatives of Pennsylvania were held first at Philadelphia, then at Lancaster, and subsequently for nearly the last twenty years at Harrisburg, which, from its central situation, has been found much more convenient. The cham ber where the representatives hold their sittings is very large, with separate desks for every two or three members, disposed in a semicircle, in the same manner as in the French chamber of deputies. The chair in which the Speaker sits was filled by the celebrated patriot John Han cock, when he presided in the assembly, by the"], [71, "63 IN AMERICA. members of which the declaration of indepen dence was signed in the state-house at Philadel phia. The senate and representatives had just finished their sittings, after having passed only two hundred and sixty-seven Acts. I saw a list of them. They chiefly related to internal im provements ; and many of them made honourable provision for old soldiers, or the widows and families of old soldiers, who had served in the revolutionary war. An experiment, which would have been deemed serious in an older country, was on the eve of trial : an Act had been passed for levying a tax on personal property through out the state. The bulk of the taxes had hitherto been paid by the land owners, and a new assessment made once every three years. The annual tax is at the rate of one, two, or three dollars the acre, according to the value of the land. The owner of personal property only,"], [72, "64 SIX MONTHS however, enjoyed an immunity, of which the present measure was intended to divest him, by making him pay a tax of one dollar in a thousand. Every individual will be obbged to swear to the amount of his personal property; and should he be supposed to swear falsely, an officer will be empowered to compel the production of any deed, bond, note, or bill, or of any writing being evidence of a debt owing to him. How ever, the general opinion seemed to be, that the graceless impost would be acquiesced in as one of fairness and necessity. On account of the enterprise of canals, railroads, and other im provements, the state debt of Pennsylvania is larger than that of any other of the Union, amounting to 14,463,161 dollars, \u2014 the debt of New York amounting to nearly 9,000,000 dol lars. The individual State debts are very likely to be increased rather than diminished, in the"], [73, "IN AMERICA. 65 end ; but as no State debt has in any instance been increased except for the purposes of in ternal improvements, the augmentation of the debt will but add eventually to the prosperity and wealth of the State. Suppose any state, New York for instance, were to borrow 4,000,000 dollars for some public w'ork, as a canal or rail road, at a fixed rate of interest, and that the capital borrowed were to be reimbursable in the year 1850. Such a rate of tonnage would be levied on the canal or railroad as would, after payment of the interest, leave a sinking fund available for the redemption of the capital bor rowed, and the State would be left in possession of a large tract of country rendered productive and valuable on account of the additional facility afforded for the carriage of produce to market. Once only since the formation of the consti tution, and during the presidency of John"], [74, "66 SIX MONTHS Adams, has a direct and general property-tax been imposed by the federal government in time of peace. The view from the dome of the capitol at Harrisburg is very fine; but a much better is obtained from the summit of a hill about a mile behind the town, although, perhaps, the town itself is not seen to such advantage. A great part of the surrounding country is very well cultivated; corn-fields, pasture, and woodlands, are distributed over hill and hollow ; and occa sionaby here and there is perceived a smaU farm-house, of a neater and more English ap pearance than any I had yet seen. On every side the landscape is terminated as usual by a boundless forest. The Susquehanna seems to lose itself through a gap in the Blue Mountains ; and throughout the whole of its course, which is visible for a great distance, its banks and"], [75, "IN AMERICA. beautiful islands are clothed with the richest foliage to the water's edge. I proceeded along the north bank of the river towards Duncan's Island, and after a ride of eight or nine miles, I arrived at the gap I have just mentioned. Its scenery forcibly reminded me of the Rhine at Drachenfells. The abrupt and lofty hill on the left is not surmounted by a \" castled crag, \" but it overhangs, perhaps, a nobler river, whose banks are covered with the forest trees of Ame rica, instead of being formally scarped for the culture of vines, trimmed like gooseberry bushes. At a short distance from the gap, the river is crossed by an enormous wooden bridge of eight arches, which is very nearly half a mile in length. The bridges in America are usually of wood, of admirable construction, neatly painted, and covered over like many of the bridges in Switzerland. The piers are of stone"], [76, "68 SIX MONTHS of great size, and buttressed towards the stream. This bridge is the largest of the kind I have seen any where. In the garden of the inn, or tavern, as it is usually called, is an Indian tumulus, about fifteen feet in height, hemispherical in shape, and evidently once much higher. These tu muli are to be seen in various parts of Penn sylvania, and in fact, in all parts of America; often two are found at no great distance from one another. At Liverpool, in that state, are two of them, about three quarters of a mile apart; but one had been ploughed over by the Gothic proprietor of the soil. At first it is not difficult to infer from this, that a great battle had taken place in the vicinity, and that each party had adopted this place for the burial of the dead, \u2014 that universally, and eternally distinguishing characteristic between mankind"], [77, "69 IN AMERICA. and those of the brute creation that make the nearest approaches to humanity. Where, how ever, they are found singly, the researches of Mr. Jefferson and of others, induce us to bebeve that they were heaped together upon other occasions. In one which he opened, Mr. Jef ferson conjectures that there might be as many as a thousand skeletons ; and appearances indi cated that it had derived its origin and enlarge ment from a custom of collecting the bones of the dead on the spot at different times. They were deposited in layers, but in the utmost confusion of relative position ; the bones of the most distant parts of the body being crowded together. Those of infants and half-grown persons were found among them. These tumuli are sometimes composed of earth, and sometimes of loose stones, like the cairn and carnedd of Scotland and Wales. VOL. I. F"], [78, "70 SIX MONTHS The conjecture, that they were either raised over the dead in battle, or in accordance with the custom supposed by Mr. Jefferson, is the more probable, on account of the bones being always found in quantities. The Eu ropean tumuli, of whatever age or nation, have either been heaped up over the ashes of some distinguished person, or are found to contain but a few coffins, of rough-hewn and > loose stone. In America, I believe, none are supposed to cover the remains of one person only, deeply buried as in Europe, under the superincumbent mass; but in the tumuli of America the external coating of earth will easily crumble away when disturbed, and will fre quently discover the bones at a trifling depth beneath the surface. Arrows and other imple ments of war are frequently found amongst them. The formation of these tumuli is no"], [79, "71 IN AMERICA. where understood to be a modern custom. The Indians have a feeling of reverence for them, and use them as land marks ; but the most aged are unable to furnish any clue to the discovery of their antiquity. The knowledge of their own ancestors is confined to three or four gene rations, and nothing certain is known of the aborigines who formed these tumidi. Humboldt himself, in his \" New Spain, \" after a learned dissertation on the subject, is obliged to admit that \" the general question of the first origin of the inhabitants of the continent, is beyond the limits prescribed to history, and is not perhaps even a philosophical question.\" There can be no doubt that they were a distinct race, and more civibsed than the wild Indians of the present day, whose Asiatic origin is also a subject of dispute. Humboldt believes that the analogy between the languages of Tartary and those of f 2"], [80, "72 SIX MONTHS the new Continent extends to a very small number of words. He adds, that the want of wheat, oats, barley, rye, and of all those nutri tive gramina which go under the name of cereal, seems to prove that if Asiatic tribes passed into America, they must have descended from pas toral people. We see in the old continent, that the cultivation of cereal gramina, and the use of milk were introduced as far back as we have any historical records. The inhabitants of the new continent, cultivated no other gramina than maize. They fed on no species of milk, though the lamas alpacas, and in the north of Mexico and Canada, two kinds of indi genous oxen, would have afforded them milk in abundance. These are striking contrasts between the Mongol and American race. How ever, in the Transactions of the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec, there has lately"], [81, "73 IN AMERICA. been published a \" Catalogue of a few (ninety six) remarkable instances, which induce a belief of the Asiatic origin of the North American Indians. By Major Mercer, R. A.\" These I re commend, as they are very interesting. Robert son says that \" the Esquimaux Indians, are the only people in America who, in their aspect and character, bear any resemblance to the Northern Europeans.\" They differ from all the other Indian tribes in their language, disposition, and habits of life. He thence infers the probabibty of their having originally passed over from the North-west of Europe, and adds, \" that among all the other inhabitants of America, there is such a striking similitude in the form of their bodies, and the qualities of their minds, that notwith standing the diversities occasioned by the influence of climate, or unequal progress of improvement, we must pronounce them to be"], [82, "74 SIX MONTHS descended from one source \u2014 the north east of Asia.\" It may be here added, that Cuvier, when speaking of the mouflon of the Blue Mountains, informs us, that it is the only quadruped of any size, the discovery of which is entirely modern, and gives it as his opinion, that perhaps it is only a Siberian goat that has crossed the ice. The junction of the Susquehanna and Juni ata rivers, takes place at Duncan's Island. The latter is a much smaller river, varying from one to two hundred yards in breadth. In some places its thickly forested banks rise to a great height above the gloomy-looking stream, whose dark placidity is occasionally disturbed by small rapids, or falls, as they are termed, though they hardly deserve the name. I observed a sunken raft, and one solitary fish-hawk (osprey). The"], [83, "IN AMERICA. 75 road continues along the side of the Juniata for several miles ; it then leaves it, and conducts the traveller to Lewistown. I observed nothing remarkable in this place. Its situation, however, is picturesque, as it is surrounded with abrupt hills and rising grounds of different elevation, with plenty of forest, as usual. The distance from Lewistown to a place called Brown's Mills, is not more than five miles. Here I found an excellent country inn, kept by an Irishman, and a most delicious trouting stream, running rapidly through the woods, and emerging close to the inn. It is wadeable in every part, and swarms with trout, some of them weighing more than three pounds. Those lulled with a fly, do not average more than half a pound in weight ; but it is no uncommon occurrence to kill five or six dozen in two or three hours. When I was there, and in fact during the whole time I passed in"], [84, "76 SIX MONTHS Pennsylvania, the season was early, and the weather cold and unfavourable, so that I killed but very few fish. A severe walk of twenty-five miles through the forest, and across a range of hills known by the name of the Seven Mountains, brought me to Belfont; a large and thriving town, conspicuous from being placed on a hill in the midst of a very pretty country. Close to Belfont are three sub mountain streams, or creeks, as they are called in America. Spring creek in particular, contains an enormous quan tity of trout, of about the same size as those at Brown's Mills; but the weather was still unfavourable, and it was aU in vain that I waded down the stream for nearly four miles. I took but seven or eight moderate-sized fish. The red hackle is considered the best general fly. The other streams are known by the names of the Bald Eagle, and Logan's creek. The former"], [85, "IN AMERICA. 77 takes its name from a bald eagle's nest, that was annually built in the vicinity, or, which is more probable, from a tribe of Indians so called, who resided there. At the head waters of the other creek, is still seen the place of residence of the celebrated Mingo chief, Logan, \u2014 whose eloquent message to Lord Dunmore, is too well known to need insertion here. Many of the aged inhabitants of Belfont still remember him. His fate resembled that of Demosthenes and Cicero : he perished for his eloquence. An old officer of the United States army, who, soon after the close of the revolutionary war, was ordered to make surveys of the country watered by the Alleghany river, informed me that Logan's nephew, a remarkably fine young Indian, dined with him one day in his tent, and that he asked him what became of Logan. I kiUed him, was the reply. Why did you kill him ?\u2014"], [86, "78 SIX MONTHS The nation ordered it. For what reason? \u2014 He was too great a man to bve : he talked so web, that although the whole nation had in tended to put any plan in execution, yet, if Logan did not approve of it, he would soon gain a majority in favour of his opinions. Was he not then generally in the right ? \u2014 Often ; but his influence divided the nation too much. Why did they choose you to put him to death ? If any one else had done it, I would certainly have killed him : I, who am his nephew, shall inherit his greatness. Will they not then kill you also ? \u2014 Yes : and when I become as great a man as Logan (laying his hand on his breast with dignity), I shall be content to die ! He added, that he shot him near the Alleghany river. When informed of the resolution of the council of his nation, Logan stopped his horse, drew himself up in an attitude of great dignity, and received the fatal ball without a murmur."], [87, "79 IN AMERICA. From Belfont I proceeded on foot over the mountains to Philipsburg, on the western slope of the Alleghany ridge. The distance was about twenty-eight miles. After walking for several hours along the side of the Bald Eagle creek, I arrived at the foot of the Alleghanies. They are composed of sandstone, and are more ex tensive than any in the States on this side of the Rocky Mountains, though their height is incon siderable. The most elevated part of the ridge in Pennsylvania does not, as I have said before, exceed 1300 feet ; but at the other peak, in Vir ginia, it rises to 3950 feet above the level of the great western rivers, being two or three hundred feet higher than Ben Lomond. The High Peak on the Rocky Mountains is the highest moun tain in the United States, and attains an eleva tion of 12,500 feet. Mount Washington, the highest of the White Mountains, is 6234 feet"], [88, "80 SIX MONTHS in height; Mansfield, in Vermont, the most lofty of the Green Mountains, is somewhat higher than Ben Nevis in Scotland, as it rises to .4279 feet. I ascended the Alleghany by a good road, that wound graduaUy up the side of the mountain, and after a walk of about three hours and a half, I was in full contem plation of the most extensive forest view I had ever yet beheld. I have seen many of the dark and impenetrable pine forests in the north of Europe, where the mountains are far higher, and the scenery proportionably grander, but I never remember a forest so interminable as that I am speaking of. One small patch of cultiva tion was perceivable in a very distant valley, called, I believe, Penn's VaUey. The vast thickets of Norway, Sweden, and Russia, are chiefly of pine trees, and are grand and gloomy enough, but sometimes tiresome from their"], [89, "IN AMERICA. 81 monotony. Nature has painted them with her usual ability; but the colouring she has em ployed may be compared to that of a drawing in Indian ink, equally creditable to the artist, but not so pleasing to the eye as a many-tinted picture. There are plenty of pines on the Alleghany, but there is also an immense assem blage of other trees. A lady informed me, that being desirous of sending to England specimens of the different woods of this part of the country, she coUected fifty-two without any difficulty; but there are many more than these. The principal material of the American navy is, as I have before noticed, afforded by the live-oak, so caUed from its being an evergreen, and from its elas ticity, extreme durability, and other generous properties. The leaf of this tree resembles the ilex of Spain and England, but is rather larger, and more pointed. It is not found in Pennsyl-"], [90, "82 SIX MONTHS vania \u2014 growing in the southern States chiefly, in Georgia and the Carobnas, whence it is con veyed to the different dock-yards of the Union. There are here, nevertheless, more than thirty varieties of the oak, each bearing a dis tinct fruit : of these, the white-oak, which is inferior in quality but comes the nearest to the navy-oak of Great Britain ; the red-oak, the black, and the rock, or scrub-oak, are the most common. The other trees of the forest, are usually the Spanish-chestnut (two varieties) \u2014 the horse-chestnut is not indigenous in America, but thrives well ; I saw one at the Manor near Baltimore \u2014 the hickory (two varieties); the black-walnut; the American-poplar, or tulip tree, the pride of the American forest, and growing frequently to an enormous size ; yellow, white, spruce, and hemlock pines \u2014 the larch is not found, or is rarely to be met with, in the"], [91, "IN AMERICA. 83 United States : I have not seen them in the Canadas \u2014 bass-wood, or common English-lime ; sugar-maple, white maple, red and white elm, willow, sassafras, black and yellow birch, ash, gum-tree, beech, iron-wood, mulberry, dog wood, rhododendron in great quantities, kalmea, latifolia, hazel, red and white cedar, clematis, virginiana, indigo, and a great variety of ferns and wild vines. In the autumn, or fall, as it is universally and prettily termed in America, the forest view is excessively beautiful, in consequence of the brilbant assemblage of colours exhibited by the diversity of foliage collected together.

They had responded to the sharp twang of the rifle, and re-echoed the more ter rific war-whoop ; but during the time that I remained on the top of the mountain, ab around me was as silent as the place was sobtary, with the exception of the occasional stroke from the peaceful axe of the back-woodsman, that re sounded from a glade about a mile from the spot where I had sat down to rest myself. I soon afterwards passed the Moshanan Creek, in which an expert fisherman on a fa vourable day can kill any quantity of trout he pleases. Beside the bridge, is a small and soli tary tavern, kept by an Englishman from Glou cestershire. With him resides an old man"], [93, "85 IN AMERICA. named Joseph Earl, a complete specimen of the real backwoodsman; just such a character as Leatherstocking, in Mr. Cooper's novel. He will take his rifle and his knapsack, and fre quently absent himself for weeks at a time in search of game. If he kill a deer, he will carry off the skin, and hang up the venison in a secure place, and from his intimate acquaintance with the mountains, and every settler who lives in them, no long time elapses before he can com mand any assistance he may require. The prin cipal tenants of the forest are the cougar or painter (panther), as it is very improperly termed; the bear, the wolf, the lynx (called the cat-a-mount), the wild cat, the marmot, the ra coon, the opossum, and red and grey foxes. The deer, which in some places is very abundant, is the cervus virginianus, a species unknown in Europe, of a size between the red and common VOL. I. g"], [94, "86 SIX MONTHS fallow deer, with a small palmated horn. Be side this there are but two species of deer found in the eastern States, the moose deer, or great Siberian elk, and the American elk, four of which were exhibited in London some years ago under the coined name of wapiti, and which have bred very well in England. Other kinds of deer, and goats, and sheep, and an antelope from the Rocky Mountains, are exhibited in the Zoological museum. The reindeer is found in the colder latitudes of Lower Canada, where it exists in large herds. A species of stag of gigantic size, with enormous horns, wThich Hum boldt considers as a distinct species, is very common in the forests and plains of New Cali fornia. He thinks it probable that the horns which were displayed by Montezuma to the companions of Cortez, as objects of curiosity on account of their immense size, belonged to this"], [95, "87 IN AMERICA. animal. A species of the same genus as the European chevreuil, or roebuck, is also found in Canada and some of the States. It is larger, and longer eared than the European animal. Of the cervus virginianus, or common deer of America, a single hunter will sometimes kill two or three in a day ; but will more often go without a shot, as they are very wild, and their sense of smell ing exceedingly acute. A still day is unfavour able ; a windy day is the best, as the sportsman can then come very near them on the windward side. The cougar is their greatest enemy, but is luckily not very common. A few years ago an American gentleman who had taken up his shooting-quarters at the tavern I have just men tioned, wounded a deer, and tracked it by the blood. On coming up with it, he observed a cougar on the animal ; he fired, and had the satisfaction to see it drop dead. When he g 2"], [96, "88 SIX MONTHS approached, he saw another, that had crouched behind the body of the deer. He disabled him, and kibed him with the third shot. As he was returning, he killed another deer, and brought all the four skins with him to the tavern. The old Englishman shewed me the scalp of a deer that had been killed during the last season : a cougar was in full pursuit of him ; and the deer took to the water close by the tavern. The cougar sprang on him in the water, but made off when he saw one of the old man's sons ap proaching with a rifle, from which the poor deer received his death-wound immediately after wards. I found that there was a penalty of five dollars for killing a deer at this season of the year. The winged game of these forests are \u2014 the wild turkey, which being pursued with avidity by the sportsman, is becoming more scarce every day : it is larger than the tame turkey, and its"], [97, "89 IN AMERICA. plumage closely resembles that of the dark coloured domesticated bird, but is rather more brilliant; the pheasant, which is a species of wood-grouse ; the partridge, which should rather be termed a quail, but which is, in fact, as I have hereafter noticed, neither one nor the other ; the woodcock, snipe, pigeons, and wild fowl, in great abundance. The largest snakes found in these forests, are the rattle-snake, the copper-head, or moccasin snake, so called from its yellow colour, resem bling that of the moccasin, or Indian sandal ; and the black-snake. The latter grows to the length of seven or eight feet, and even longer. It moves with great rapidity, is a species of the boa-constrictor, and its habits and manner of taking its prey are similar to those of that tre mendous reptile. The bite is not poisonous. The copper-head is a very dangerous snake, as"], [98, "90 SIX MONTHS it gives no warning like the rattle-snake. Its name is its description, as far as it goes. Its length is about three feet. The rattle-snake is too well known to need much description : it invariably raises its tail and rattles before it strikes, so that, in general, it can be easily avoided. The Indians consider this as proof of its noble nature, and accordingly they never destroy it, believing that it has something divine in it. A large rattle-snake w7ould measure four feet in length, perhaps, or a little more, but is very thick in proportion. When about to attack, it suddenly coils itself, with the tail raised, and rattling in the middle of the coil, and can strike from nearly its whole length. It is a very spirited animal ; and from its moving but slowly out of the way, is destroyed with little difficulty. Much has been said of the extreme danger of its bite, and of the number of persons bitten ;"], [99, "91 IN AMERICA. but like the accidents from canine madness in England, they are far more often heard of than met with. It is most probable that a person would die, unless immediately assisted, \u2014 or have at all events a very narrow escape, if bitten on any part of the body that happened to be naked ; but if struck through his clothes, so great a proportion of poison is by them absorbed, or prevented from coming in contact with the blood, that the bite, if taken in time, is not dangerous. It is a well known and singular fact, that the body of a person bitten, will sometimes change whilst under the influence of the poison, to the colour of the snake that bit him. The plant called the rattle-snake weed (bidens fron dosa) is a remedy used by the Indians, and sometimes, I was credibly informed, with great effect. The leaves and root are boiled in milk"], [100, "92 SIX MONTHS and used as a poultice ; the milk is also taken internally. In Mr. Pratt's botanical garden at Philadelphia, I saw a specimen of another plant which is also considered efficacious (polygela senaga) called by the French \"l'herbe a serpente a sonnettes.\" It grows in damp and shady parts of the woods, to a height of about two feet ; has a small pointed leaf, and a single fusiform root, resembling a piece of stick liquorice. I was, however, assured by a phy sician of eminence at Philadelphia, that the only remedy he had never known to fail, was the speedy application of a cupping glass to the wound, and a large tea spoonful of ammonia in a wine glass filled with water, administered every hour till the symptoms took a favourable turn. It is well known that hogs soon destroy every snake in the woods around a settlement. They eat them, and are seldom known to suffer"], [101, "IN AMERICA. 93 from the bite, owing, it is said, to the quantity of fat in their system. Almost every wild animal is their enemy; smab birds will often peck at them, although at the same time credence is certainly to be given to the stories of fascination or terror by which small animals, such as squirrels and birds, are sometimes rendered unable to escape from them. Deer will crush them to death, by jumping on them with all their four feet brought close together. I was frequently told that rattle-snakes were common here and there ; but still I never saw one : the fact is, that they generally lie concealed. A person travelbng in the woods, will sometimes come suddenly upon fifty or a hundred of them bask ing on the rocks. They all retire as the cold weather approaches, and lie torpid during the whole winter ; so that a sportsman is in no danger from them. A French gentleman, who"], [102, "94 SIX MONTHS a year or two ago was shooting grouse very early in the season, on the mountains in New Jersey, was suddenly struck near his hip by a rattle-snake of the largest size; thanks to his loose sustain trowsers, the fangs did not touch him; the brute could not extricate itself, and hung upon him till stunned by repeated blows from his gun. Philipsburg is rapidly increasing, under the advantages of English superintendence : it con tains about eight hundred inhabitants in the town and environs. It is almost exclusively the property of one English gentleman, who is master of nearly 70,000 acres in that part of the country. While I partook of his hospitabty, I was agreeably surprised by the circle of English society, which I found collected under his roof."], [103, "95 IN AMERICA. Several English have made Philipsburg their place of residence. Its advantages consist in a remarkably healthy situation on the western slope of the Alleghanies, where the descent is so gradual as to be hardly perceptible ; an easy and constant communication with Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh on the Ohio; excebent trout fishing, and shooting in the forest ; a very cheap market (a sheep or deer can be bought for a dollar), and excellent medical advice. Uncleared land may be purchased at one, two, or three dollars an acre. The large beaver dams in this neighbourhood afford the finest pasture imaginable. They run for several miles along the side of the Moshanan Creek. What is now called a beaver dam, is not merely the fence or dam w-hich that indus trious animal had thrown across the stream, but the whole meadow over which the water was"], [104, "96 SIX MONTHS spread in consequence of its being arrested in its course. The beaver was held sacred by the Indians, and their habitations were probably undisturbed for centuries. The stream, when checked in its career by the dam which those extraordinary animals had constructed, found its level, of course, in every nook to which it could gain access ; and tree and shrub rotted away with so much moisture. As the beaver was destroyed, or driven out by the progress of civilization, the dams gave way, and the stream soon returned to its former channel, and the bottom of the pond or dam is converted into a fine meadow, exceedingly valuable for the pur poses of the grazier. A person may travel through the forest for many miles, .and will suddenly emerge upon a green open space, with scarcely a tree or shrub upon it, although at the same time it be surrounded by a leafy wall of"], [105, "IN AMERICA. 97 the loftiest forest trees. An English gentleman had just commenced a farm on one of these dams, and I rode about six miles through the woods to visit him. The place had much the appearance of an English park, which deer and other wild animals would frequently cross, and sometimes within rifle-shot from his window. It was more than a mile in length, with the shape and appearance of a billiard table. At Philipsburg, and in the neighbourhood, are several iron works. I visited a curious screw manufactory there: the machine for head ing the screws was invented on the spot, and probably there is not such another to be found any where. It turned out about sixty screws in a minute, and finished them off with a neat ness that would excite the surprise even of a mechanist. I have before mentioned that Philadelphia"], [106, "98 SIX MONTHS will shortly be connected with the Ohio river, by means of the Columbia rail-road, from which the great Pennsylvania canal will soon be finished to the foot of the Alleghany mountains, where it will be joined by another rail-road, which will pass the mountains, and communicate with Pittsburg. Another rail-road will, most pro bably, be constructed, so as to intersect the same canal a little above Huntingdon. It will come from the bituminous coal district, wilich lies about Philipsburg and Clearfield county, and is spread over a great extent of ground on the western slope of the Alleghany. Plenty of stone or anthracite coal is to be found in many parts of Pennsylvania, and in vast quantities; but the bituminous coal used in the transatlantic cities is supplied either from Liverpool, from Nova Scotia, or from Virginia. The particles of the Virginia coal, however, are too much"], [107, "IN AMERICA. 99 divided, and it more resembles the coal used by a blacksmith, than the Newcastle coal. I have understood that bituminous coal has been lately discovered, although in very small quan tities, in Pennsylvania, on the eastern side of the mountain. The anthracite coal throws out a very powerful heat, but is very troublesome and unmanageable, requiring a long time before it will kindle properly; burning without flame or smoke, and creating an unpleasant and rather unhealthy dryness in the atmosphere of a room. An experiment had been successfully tried in New York, by which the anthracite coal had been rendered subservient to the purposes of the steam-engine. It was contrived that a stream of hydrogen-gas, generated by part of the engine, should flow constantly over the burning coal, so that a powerful flame was thus fed under the boiler. But in all cases where a"], [108, "100 SIX MONTHS manageable fire is required, the bituminous coal is far preferable. By means of the Philipsburg rail-road, the whole country will be supplied with this valuable mineral, at a very moderate expense, from the inexhaustible stores on the western slope of the Alleghany. The necessity of making cheaper iron is becoming daily more imperative in the United States. For this end, to say nothing of the carriage of timber, the Philipsburg rail-road will be very advantageous, as it will bring down the coal to be converted into coke, to be used in the smelting furnaces; and it will pass through the midst of the Juniata iron district, where more than twenty forges and furnaces already exist in full activity ; and whose increasing importance calls for a more adequate and expeditious mode of conveyance than it at present commands. The whole country will be much benefited ; and independently of the real"], [109, "IN AMERICA. 101 and lasting advantages to be gained by the construction of the Philipsburg rail-road, an early attention to the plan, from the proper quarter, will be but justice to the exertions of a gentleman, who, with his brothers before him, has devoted time and capital to the enterprise, and has called into existence a highly respect able community, and the most thriving and useful settlement in the back woods of Penn sylvania. I left Philipsburg, and returned to Belfont, whence I took the road to Northumberland. In about six hours I again came in sight of the Susquehanna, flowing through an extensive valley, with its lofty southern bank robed to the very summit by a covert so thickly interwoven as to be absolutely impassable. I proceeded VOL. I. H"], [110, "102 SIX MONTHS down the side of the river till I arrived at the ferry at Dunnsburg. Here I met with a piece of singidar incivility and impudence. The insolent young Charon allowed me to place my luggage in his leak)- bark ; but as I was proceeding to take my seat, he \" calkilated,\" with the most dis agreeable twang (at least, I thought so) that I had yet heard, \" that I must pay him a sip (five penny bit) before I put my foot into his boat.\" It was ab in vain that I pointed to my portman teau, intimating that it would be \"assets\" for the payment of my passage to the other side. Nothing would satisfy him but my sip before hand ; and I was obliged to pay it. It appeared that some stage-passengers had gone off without paying, and he did not wish to be cheated a second time. The guard who arrived with the mail, was so enraged at his conduct, that he actually took out one of the horses, crammed"], [111, "IN AMERICA. 103 him through the river, and arrived safely on the other side with the letter-bags. Within a mile or two of Dunnsburg, are some Indian tumuli ; but I did not stop to see them. I travelled onward through a most de lightful country, abounding in black-oak ; the bark of which is sent clown the river, and shipped off in great quantities for England, where it is used in dying. I enjoyred a very fine view from the hill over which the road passes near Moncey ; but I afterwards saw the same pros pect to much greater advantage, from North umberland. This place contains about two thousand inhabitants, and is most delightfully situated on the neck of land that separates the northern and western branches of the Susque hanna. The celebrated Dr. Priestley spent the latter years of his life in this place. He died about twenty-five years ago. I was assured by h2"], [112, "104 SIX MONTHS an old and intimate friend of his, who was with him but a few minutes before he died, that there was great foundation for a prevalent belief, that for some months previously to his death, he changed his opinions in favour of the divinity of Christ. Good land, in a state of cultivation, is worth twenty, thirty, forty, or even a hundred dobars the acre, in this part of the country. The ave rage profits of land amount to twelve and a half per cent. Thirty bushels of wheat is a good crop. The wages of the married labourer are fifteen dollars a month (the United States dollar is equal to 4*. 6c?.). Single men, who board at the house of their employer, receive but ten. Wherever I made inquiry, I found the rate of labourers' wages to be much the same through out the States. I crossed the western branch of the Susque-"], [113, "105 IN AMERICA. hanna by a new and handsome wooden bridge, built as usual on stone piers. Its length was 1316 feet, and it cost 70,000 dollars. I then immediately ascended the heights on the other side. From them I had a full view of both branches of this \"shining river,\" an appellation which none deserves better than the Susque hanna. I preferred the scenery around Moncey to that in the direction of Wyoming. The sun was declining behind the precipice on which I stood, which was thrown more and more into shade, as the red rays glanced through the pines on its summit, and swept downward into the broad and beautiful valley beneath me. The windings of the river were visible to a great distance. Although considerably larger, it strongly reminded me of the Thames seen from Richmond-hill. Its tranquil lake-like stream meandered through the country, encir-"], [114, "106 SIX MONTHS cling several islands : at one time gliding in silence through the forest, or emerging to rob its waters over a rich and extensive meadow, it freshened every thing in its course; and when it had fully performed the task of ornament and usefulness abotted to it by nature, it seemed to lose itself through a gap in the Blue Mountains, from which in reality it issued. Beautiful as it is, yet, were this England, I could not help thinking, how different would be the appearance of the country ! I am gazing on a view, as splendid as any one of the same character I ever beheld in any land, \u2014 I see be fore me a noble river, winding its way through an exquisite landscape, of hill and dale, and wood and verdure, abounding in every resource that could make a country life agreeable; but it is in vain that my disappointed eye roves over the scene, and rests on the most magnificent"], [115, "IN AMERICA. 107 situations for park and palace : where, thought I, are the \"stately homes of England?\" \u2014 where is the marble-fronted hall, and the village church beside it, with its spire pointing to the heavens? The powerless genius of embellish ment wanders disconsolate along the beautiful banks of the Susquehanna, and bitterly com plains that he is fettered by the spirit of de- mocracy. I am far from meaning to infer in the above passage, that there is any lack of churches in the United States. On the contrary, they are numerous. As an Englishman, I am here speak ing merely with reference to situation, and the association of ideas excited in my mind. The Americans, in general, are not fond of comparisons between England and their own country, except in cases where the balance is in their favour ; but still, I have often observed"], [116, "108 SIX MONTHS that there is no subject of conversation more gladly discussed by an American gentleman, and more particularly by those who have country houses of their own, than the splendour of the seats of our nobility and gentry, and the per fection of society which is enjoyed at them. There is nothing in England so apt to elicit from them a remark of honest regret, as their knowledge of the very remote probabbity, I may almost add, the utter hopelessness, of their ever being able to boast of seats and villas at ab equal to those on this side of the Atlantic, so long as the present form of government exists in full force. Who would build a really splendid mansion, which, after his death, will probably either become a ruin, or be sold, and converted into an hospital ? or who would clear and beau tify a park of any extent, to be divided and ploughed up by his needy successors? I have"], [117, "IN AMERICA. 109 seen country houses in America, whose delight ful situation, and gentlemanly appearance, (although it must be abowed, they often look their best at a distance), only serve to render the prospect of division the more melancholy. I have been kindly received at many of them : I have usuaby noticed a due attention to comfort and elegance, and invariably, to kindness and hospitality ; but I have not been able to avoid a remark, that there did not appear to be much difference in the size of the houses, or the extent of the grounds, as if there existed a general and mournful acknowledgment, that a just medium was to be observed between the expense mcurred with reference to present enjoyment, and the probability of an ultimate loss of capital, when the future was regarded. I could name a few, but very few, exceptions. Whatever the Americans may think of their"], [118, "110 SIX MONTHS institutions in other respects, there are many sen sible Americans \u2014 and I have met with them \u2014 who will acknowledge the inefficacy of these to counteract the disadvantages, not to say miseries, sometimes arising from the non-exist ence of the law of primogeniture. The object is, to exclude the preponderance of wealth, because it tends to generate an aristocracy of political power. The non-existence of the law of primogeniture is, I think, with great defer ence, but lamely defended by Chancellor Kent, in his admirable Commentaries on American Law, and which, by the way, are most richly deserving of a place in every library, if it be merely on account of the learned dissertations on the history of every republic of note that has ever existed. He quotes Adam Smith in support of his opinions ; the Marquess Gamier, his French translator; and the Baron de Stael"], [119, "IN AMERICA. 111 Holstein, \u2014 and although he acknowledges the attendant evils, yet he says it would be an error to suppose that they have been already felt. But surely there are some which he does not contemplate in his work; but which must be acknowledged to have a miserable effect upon the state of society. A sale, not unattended with sacrifice, takes place at the decease of nearly every person who dies in possession of landed property. This is followed by a minute division of the proceeds amongst the next of kin. As to the law of dower, it is much the same as that of England generally ; but where the sale has been made, the produce is considered as real estate so far, and the widow receives an annuity from one third in lieu of her dower. This does not effect the distribution of the remainder, which is divided as in England. It often happens, that the share of each person."], [120, "112 SIX MONTHS if young, is just enough to purchase his de struction. Very frequently, but in some States more than others, its most prominent application is detected by the effects of a vicious indulgence in ardent spirits, principally among the second and lower classes. Drunkenness still prevails to an alarming extent, notwithstanding the benign presence of the temperate societies. I have heard the most melancholy and appabing accounts of its ravages in private life ; and in one place I was informed of its disgustbig in fluence over judicial morabty. The root of the evil is in the expectations which are formed : it is the certainty of actual possession of pro perty at a future time, accompanied by igno rance as to its amount, that so often cherishes in the children the most dissolute habits of idle ness, with all their attendant evils. Supposing"], [121, "IN AMERICA. 113 both of them in the same easy circumstances as country gentlemen, and fathers of families, how different must of necessity be the sentiments of an American and an Englishman, when they sur vey their respective fire sides! Both see around them their wives and children, in the posses sion of affluence and comfort, and happy in the enojoyment of each other's society. But in the event of his death, how gloomy may be the picture drawn by the one, in opposition to that contemplated by the other ! A divided estate and a dispersed family, present themselves to the mind of the American ; or perhaps a small part of them lhing together, but unable to com mand any share of the luxuries, and not many of the comforts they enjoy during his lifetime, in consequence of a secession of property by marriage, or decrease of it from dissipation. The Englishman feels a debt of gratitude to the"], [122, "114 SIX MONTHS constitution of his country : in the event of his death, his house, in the possession of his eldest son, will be a home for his widow and a place of meeting for his children. His younger sons have been brought up under the idea that they are to be the architects of their own fortunes, and such a doctrine has not rendered them unhappy, because it has enforced the virtue of contentment. The law of primogeniture per petuates, through the eldest son, a species of parental affection and authority; and where there is a title to descend, there is a further induce ment to the eldest son to emulate the virtues or the actions of an illustrious father ; or, if that father has brought disgrace upon a distinguished name or sullied the escutcheon of a distinguished family (which, be it added, is sometimes the case), the son may be naturally desirous of wiping away the stain, and of giving the benefit"], [123, "IN AMERICA. 115 of his example to society, by his imitation of the character of a nobler ancestor.' There is yet a further deficiency of inducement to exertion existing in the American, and in every other democracy. In England, a young man in the enjoyment of a sufficient income, and who is consequently not obliged to labour at any profession with a view to its increase, yet with the possibility of obtaining a title, will exert his abilities to the utmost; but in America, the stimulus of titled distinction being unknown, it must often happen that the finest talents are doomed to remain unemployed. I crossed the north branch of the Susque hanna, and passed on to the town of Sunbury, on the bank of the main river, and about two miles distant from Northumberland. Sunbury is a very pretty country town, with a delightful promenade along the side of the river. In all"], [124, "116 SIX MONTHS parts of the vicinity there are some beautiful prospects : near it, a very large dam has been thrown across the stream, where, by the junction of its two branches, it spreads out, and forms a basin three quarters of a mile across. I ob served some fishermen hauling their nets, and went up to them. They had taken some cat fish, and several salmon. The cat-fish has ob tained its name from its appearance : its head, which is out of all proportion to its body, is large and round, with the addition of two worm like appendages projecting beneath the eyes, like the whiskers of a cat. It is altogether a dark, ugly-looking fish ; but is eatable, with a flavour something like that of an eel, but infe rior. In the larger western rivers it sometimes attains a weight of eighty or one hundred pounds. The fish improperly called the salmon, in no respects resembles the real salmon of"], [125, "117 IN AMERICA. Great Britain. It has none of the peculiarities of the salmo genus ; and does not rise at a fly. In figure it is not remarkable; in colour it is more similar to the pike than to any fish I am acquainted with. The weight of those usually taken, is about a pound ; but some of them are larger. A fly-fisher would have but moderate sport on the Susquehanna ; but he might kill a great variety of fish, if he condescended to use a bait, and might occasionally take a large trout with a minnow. The river contains pike and eels, of immense size; trout, not numerous ; rock-fish, cat-fish, suckers, common and silver perch \u2014 -a beautiful fish ; and a very small species of lamprey, that is only used as a bait. The shad is also found in great quantities in this and almost all the rivers of the Eastern States. It is excellent eating, and usually weighs about four pounds; but I thought the flavour of the Sus- vol. I. i"], [126, "118 SIX MONTHS quehanna salmon equal, if not superior, to any fish I tasted in the United States. I should almost presume that it was peculiar to that river, as I have frequently met with natives of other States who had never heard of it. At Sunbury, I chanced to be told that three Yorkshiremen had just been taken up. I would bet three to one, said I to myself, that their crime is horse-stealing ! and so it proved when I made inquiry. I here turned my steps away from the Sus quehanna, which for placid beauty surpassed in my opinion any other river in the States, and proceeded towards Philadelphia, by way of Pottsville and Reading. Scarcely more than a year ago there were but a few houses at the former place ; but in consequence of the imme diate vicinity of enormous beds of anthracite coal, and the improved means of conveyance"], [127, "119 IN AMERICA. to Philadelphia, its size and importance had in creased in a most extraordinary manner. The country around Philadelphia is very flat ; so that I could not find a rising ground to take a sketch from, at what I considered the best distance. But, I think, in passing down the river, in my way to Baltimore, I perceived a small cliff on the left bank, that would have answered the purpose, being distant about two miles and a half. A view in a flat country requires great minuteness, if it be taken cor rectly, and would have occupied too much time ; besides, before commencing a drawing of either of the larger cities in the Union, it really became a matter of consideration, that I had but one cake of \" Newman's light red\" in my colour-box. A fine steamer carried me down the Dela ware. About thirty-five miles from Philadelphia, i 2"], [128, "120 SIX MONTHS we passed Wilmington and Brandywine. We were then landed at the mouth of the Chesapeake and Delaware canal, and were towed onward, at a brisk trot, in one of the canal boats, and soon entered the Elk river, near the head waters of Chesapeake bay. The country was flat ; and a great proportion of it was covered with forest. Here we went on board another steam-boat, that rattled us along at a tremendous pace down the Chesapeake, passing the mouth of the Sus quehanna. The captain assured me that upon one occasion, during a camp-meeting, he had carried no less than fifteen hundred persons at a time; he landed them during the night, and about two hundred got away without paying their passage. In an hour or two, the North Point, at the entrance of the Patapsco river, became visible. General Ross landed here, with the British"], [129, "IN AMERICA. 1_1 force of 5000 men, on the 12th of September, 1814, and met his death in the skirmish that ensued shortly afterwards. I rode from Balti more to the spot where he fell, marked by a small plain stone-monument, by the side of the road. The last four miles out of fourteen lay through a very pretty wood, affording a most grateful shade. When we were within two miles from the city, we passed Fort Mac Henry, which was bombarded upon the same occasion, almost from the extremity of the range of a shell. Some of them, where they fell, penetrated the ground to a depth of five or six feet. Baltimore, when viewed from the Chesa peake, appears to be built over several low hills, or slopes, and surrounded by others that are considerably higher. Its situation is much finer than that of Philadelphia. It is not so fine as"], [130, "122 SIX MONTHS that of New York; but in some respects, is, I think, superior to Boston. When approached by water, the most conspicuous objects are \u2014 Washington's monument, the shot-towers, the Roman Catholic cathedral, and the Unitarian church, all scattered in different parts of the city. Washington's monument is a plain co lumn of marble, raised on a square base, 175 feet in height, and surmounted by a colossal statue of Washington. It is seen from a great distance on every side, and commands the finest and most extensive prospect; but I am very much inclined to doubt the taste that placed any other than an allegorical object on the top of a lofty pillar. The size of the column, and its simplicity, are calculated to excite admiration; but in my humble judgment, it would have been much better to have had a really fine statue placed inside the base of the column, than to"], [131, "123 IN AMERICA. perch the General upon a height that would make a living Admiral feel giddy. Lord Hill's monument, near Shrewsbury, and that to the memory of General Brock, at Queenstown, are, I think, objectionable, for the same reasons. The battle monument is much prettier, although it is somewhat florid in its ornaments : it is fifty-four feet in height. The column is a cir cular fasces, symbolical of the Union, twined round with fillets, bearing the names of those who fell on the 12th and 13th of September, 1814; and supporting an allegorical statue of a female, personifying the city of Baltimore, with a bald eagle, the United States' emblem, at her side. The Archbishop of Maryland is the me tropolitan of the States. The Catholic cathedral is a handsome building, with a dome in imitation of the Pantheon. The inside, which is divided into pews, contains two very good pictures from"], [132, "124 SIX MONTHS the French school: a descent from the cross, by Paul Guerin, presented by Louis XVI.; and St. Louis burying his dead officers and soldiers before Tunis, by Steaben, presented by Charles X. The descent from the cross is much and deservedly admired. It has the merit of being free from that tedious detail that is usually to be observed in the works of French artists, who paint every thing as it is, and not as it appears. It occurred to me, that the body of Christ did not sufficiently rest on the ground, as intended. The latter picture displays more of the French taste. I did not like it so well, but many prefer it to the other. At Baltimore, is the University of Maryland, which ranks very high as a medical school. The average expenses of a student are one hundred and twenty dollars per annum. It has also professors in law and divinity. St. Mary's College and Baltimore"], [133, "IN AMERICA. 125 College are also justly celebrated throughout the Union; the latter will accommodate one hundred and fifty students, who are instructed, by twelve professors, in the ancient and modern languages, mathematics, natural philosophy, &c. The city also contains a good museum, which I did, and many more public buildings, which I did not visit, as I could not learn that there was any thing in them particularly deserving of attention. The theatre was not open. The waters of the Chesapeake and the Patapsco are the favourite resort of the canvas back duck, which I had always been told was the greatest delicacy imaginable ; and, \" like nothing else, sir ! I assure ye ! \" The sporting commences early in November, and affords most excellent sport. An experienced shot will some-"], [134, "126 SIX MONTHS times kill three dozen in a morning with a single gun ; and occasionally they are shot on the wing with a single rifle. The canvas-back duck very much resembles the red-headed wigeon, or common dun-bird. Lucien Bonaparte, who has so well continued Wilson's work on American Ornithology, has successfully shown that it is quite a different bird. It is about half as large again, with a black and different formed bill and black legs. Those of the red-headed wigeon are of a dark lead colour. They breed on the bor ders of the great lakes, or about Hudson's Bay ; but in the winter months, they are found in prodigious quantities on the Chesapeake, the Patapsco, and the Potamac. Its flavour is owing to the root of the Vallissneria Americana, or wild celery, on which it feeds, and for which it will dive to a depth of eight or ten feet. The red-headed wigeon, when in company with the"], [135, "IN AMERICA. 127 canvas-back, will often wait till it has risen from the bottom, and then snatch from it the hard earned morsel. The Ions vivants of America, talk of the canvas-back with an interest that borders on affection, and is sometimes very amusing. \" Sir,\" said an old fellow to me, \" I wished to give a duck feast, and accordingly I bought nine couple of them, all fresh killed, and all of the right weight. I stuffed them into every corner of my gig; and would not suffer the cook to touch them, except in my presence. I dressed them all myself, in different ways, in my parlour, so as to have them all done according to figure, sir ! Well, sir ! all my company had arrived, except an old German ; we could not wait, and sat down without him. When he came, he exclaimed, ' What ! noshing but duckhs ! ' I started up in a rage, sir ! a violent rage, sir ! ' Noshing but duckhs ! ' I repeated after him :"], [136, "128 SIX MONTHS Why, you d d old scoundrel, said I, your own Emperor of Austria never had such a dinner : he could not, sir, though he gave the best jewel in his crown for it.\" I tasted these birds several times before I quitted America, and they certainly are extremely good. The meat is dark, and should be sent to table under done, or what in America is called \" rare. \" I think the flavour might be imitated by a piece of common wild duck, and a piece of fine juicy venison, tasted at the same time. The word \"rare\" used in that sense, and which is given by Johnson, on the authority of Dryden, is no doubt one of many which have retained in America, a meaning in which they are not now used in England, but which was doubtless car ried over the Atlantic by the settlers of a hundred years ago. I confess that I was for some time in error. I heard every one around"], [137, "IN AMERICA. 129 me giving orders that his meat should be \"rare,\" and I thought it a mispronunciation of the word raw. The environs of Baltimore are exceedingly pretty : almost every eminence is crowned with a country house, surrounded by gardens and pleasure grounds richly wooded, and laid out to the best advantage, so as generally to afford a peep through the trees at some part of the Patapsco, or the Chesapeake. They are admir ably adapted for a fete champetre, or a strawberry party, as it is called at Baltimore. I had the honour of an invitation to the only one that was given during my stay in that city. The com pany assembled about six o'clock. Quadrilles and waltzes were kept up with great spirit, first on the lawn, and then in the house till about eleven. In the mean time strawberries and cream, ices, pine apples, and champagne, were"], [138, "130 SIX MONTHS served up in the greatest profusion. I had understood, and am quite ready to admit, that Baltimore deservedly enjoys a high reputation for female beauty. I am speaking of the American laches in general, when I remark that it is no injustice to them to maintain, that where you will see twenty pretty girls, you will not see one really handsome woman. I have frequently observed the prettiest features, \u2014 such as more reminded me of England, than of any other country ; but I think that most Europeans who have formed a correct taste from the \"stone ideal\" of Greece, would agree with me that ladies with pretensions to that higher degree of beauty, are not so often to be met with in America as in England. There is one particular in which they would do well to imitate my fair countrywomen. They have great charms for the breakfast table ; but yet, elegant and lady-like as many of them"], [139, "IN AMERICA. 131 undoubtedly are, how often have I been com pelled to wish, that the breakfast table had not quite so many charms for them. They must know that to eat is unfeminine; and that ladies should in the presence of gentlemen, appear very hungry, is a decided proof of a deficiency in national manners, \u2014 just as much, or even more so, than that men, be they who or what they may, should sit with their hats on in the dress circle at New York. The influence of a court would extend to, and would remedy all this. I should here again remark, that the first society is seldom seen at the theatre, and would not be guilty of such behaviour. It is a matter of great surprise to a stranger, that there is not one single promenade at Balti more. There are some very eligible situations immediately adjoining the city, and which to all appearance are so easily convertible into a public"], [140, "132 SIX MONTHS walk, that it is difficult to understand why the ladies do not insist upon its commencement. I would most humbly advise them to do so. I was honoured with an invitation to \" the Manor,\" the country residence of Mr. Carroll, of Carrollton. The house was built long before the revolution, and is a curious specimen of Anglo-American architecture, somewhat resem bling one of those large old parsonage houses which are to be seen in some parts of England. It stands in the midst of an extensive domain, in a high state of cultivation, and extremely well and neatly kept, considering that it is worked by slaves. I could have fancied myself in England, but for the loose zigzag fences of split logs, which offer to the eye but a poor apology for the English hedge row. Hedges of any kind would not, generally speaking, thrive well in the United States. It would be neces-"], [141, "IN AMERICA. 133 sary, I was told, that they should be banked up, in order to keep them from being washed away by the heavy rains ; and it is probable that during the extreme heat of the summer months, they could not obtain moisture sufficient to preserve them from being dried up entirely. They are, however, often to be seen close to a gentleman's house, where they can be constantly attended to. I should conceive that the aloe hedges of Spain and Portugal, might succeed in the United States. It is neither a fault, nor a misfortune, that there is no water scenery at \" the Manor.\" The rivers and lakes of America are usually on a vast and magnificent scale, fitted either to bound or to deluge a continent ; small streams are also common ; but a lake for instance of a mile or two in length, is seldom to be seen, excepting in New England, where they are plentiful. Before I arrived there, I do not think VOL. I. k."], [142, "134 SIX MONTHS that I had seen more than half a dozen ponds, and those all in Kentucky. Instead of being thought an advantage, a piece of water is avoided; no American, from choice, would build on its banks, as the exhalations in the hot weather render such a situation very unhealthy, excepting in the more northerly states. At the manor I partook of that hospitality which is so kindly and universally extended to every foreigner who visits Baltimore with a proper letter of introduction. Mr. Carroll himself, is the most extraordinary individual in America. This venerable old gentleman is in his ninety fifth year, is exceedingly cheerful, enjoys most excellent health, and is in good possession of his faculties. He is the only survivor of the patriots who signed the Declaration of Independence on the 4th of July, 1776. He has always adhered to the federal principles, and his valuable estate"], [143, "135 IN AMERICA. is one of the very few that have descended in a direct line from the first possessor. Mr. Carroll is the grandfather of the Ladies Wellesley and Caermarthen. No one who visits Baltimore should omit seeing the vessels known by the name of clip pers. They are uncommonly neat single-decked schooners usually, but sometimes are rigged like a brig. Their burden is commonly about 200 tons. They are cut remarkably sharp at the bows, with a great breadth of beam. When lying in the water, the head is considerably elevated above the stern, so that, although the masts are nearly at right angles with the hull, they appear to rake much more than they really do. They will sail on a wind at the rate of seven knots an hour, when other fast sailing vessels can make only five and a half, or six ; but few of them are good sailers before the wind. They K 2"], [144, "136 SIX MONTHS usually make a voyage to the Havannah, where they are sold for slave ships, or to South America, where they are bought by smugglers or pirates, for whose occupations they are ad mirably adapted. They are built nowhere so well as at Baltimore. Two rail-roads had been commenced at Balti more : one called the Baltimore and Ohio rail road, because it was intended to join that river. The exact line of country through which it would pass, was as yet a secret with a select few, who would thus be able to secure from the owners a refusal of the land through which it passed without being obliged to pay an increased price. The other is called the Susquehanna rail-road, and was intended to join that river at York-haven, about sixty miles below Harris burg. Deputations have been sent from Balti more to Philadelphia, to obtain the necessary"], [145, "137 IN AMERICA. permission to carry it into the state of Pennsyl vania ; but their applications have been, I was informed, twice refused. The rail-road, however, is still continued, from a well-grounded persua sion that the inhabitants of the western parts of Pennsylvania, convinced of the advantages that will accrue to them by its affording them an other means of carriage for their bituminous coal, iron, and timber, will ultimately succeed in obtaining a majority in Congress in favour of its completion. But does not a jealousy of this kind arise, after a contemplation, however distant, of the political horizon? Has it not a prospective reference to the interest of the State separately, when the federal government shall be no more ? By the constitution of Maryland the governor does not possess the right of a veto over the Acts of the general assembly."], [146, "138 SIX MONTHS More flour is annually inspected at Balti more, than at any other port in the United States excepting New York. The amount for the year 1830, was 597,804 barrels ; but by the returns made since the first of January, 1831, it is supposed that the quantity in this year will exceed 600,000 barrels. The wheat that is shipped, is sent almost exclusively to England ; but it bears a very small proportion to the flour, although it sells better in the English market \u2014 about 70,000 bushels of wheat were shipped this year for England. The quality in general is good, excepting that a portion of it is some times tainted with garlick; a nuisance that is almost unavoidable, because the plant grows spontaneously in the wheat districts. It is said to have been first introduced by the Hessians, during the revolutionary war, and it has since increased so much, that it cannot be got rid of."], [147, "IN AMERICA. 139 The wheat exported from Baltimore is grown in the State of Maryland, and in many parts of Virginia and Pennsylvania. Money had been plentiful for the last two years, and invest ments that would produce five per cent, were not easily to be met with. A market over- stocked with imports from Europe and India, was the assignable cause : trade was compara tively less brisk, and many capitalists withdrew their funds from active business, for the purpose of investment in the stock of bank insurance and rail-road companies. A great quantity of money was likewise lying in the market hi con sequence of the national debt being in a course of reduction by the payment of government loans. However, when I was there, money was more scarce, and worth more than six per cent.; the exchange on England had risen as high as eleven per cent, per annum, and a large quantity of specie had been exported to that country."], [148, "140 SIX MONTHS At Baltimore, I first saw the fire-fly. They begin to appear about sunset, after which they are sparkling in all directions. In some places ladies will wear them in their hair, and the effect is said to be very brilliant. Mischievous boys will sometimes catch a bull-frog, and fasten them all over him. They show to great advan tage, while the poor frog, who cannot understand the \" new lights \" that are breaking upon him, affords amusement to his tormentors by hopping about in a state of desperation. About thirty miles from Baltimore, on the western shore as it is termed, stands Annapolis the capital of Maryland. It is situated at the bottom of a fine bay, and contains several curious old houses, built long before the revo lution. The most conspicuous object is the capitol, which is surmounted by a fine steeple. The general assembly of Maryland, hold their"], [149, "IN AMERICA. 141 sittings there, and it was there that General Washington resigned to the federal congress the command he had so nobly used. It sat there for some time after the independence of the United States was established. At Baltimore, I visited the studies of two very promising young artists : Mr. Hubard, an Englishman, is certainly the better painter; but has the advantage of four or five years of expe rience over Mr. Miller, who is an American, quite a boy ; and whom, I think, at least an equal genius. He has had little or no instruc tion. If sent to Europe, as he certainly ought to be, I will venture to predict, that at some future period he will be an ornament to his native city ; and which he certainly never will, or can be, if he does not leave it. Will it be credited, that in America, with all her preten sions to good sense and general encouragement"], [150, "142 SIX MONTHS of emulation and enterprise, the voice of public opinion is a bar to the advantage of drawing from a living model? Without it, historical painting cannot thrive, and sculpture must be out of the question. I left Baltimore with regret: I had been kindly and hospitably treated there, \u2014 and in a few hours the mail carried me to Washington. This city of distances \u2014 this capital that is to be \u2014 is laid out upon an open piece of undulating down, on the north side of the Potomac. The capitol of the United States is built upon the most lofty part of it, which is ascended by a fine flight of steps, and altogether has a very imposing appear ance, being visible at a great distance from almost every side. It is of free-stone, which is found on the river about thirty miles below the city. In front is a magnificent portico of Corinthian columns, and behind it there is another; in the"], [151, "IN AMERICA. 143 same style, (though larger), as that at Wanstead House in Essex, or Wentworth Castle in York shire, which is a copy of Wanstead. On the top are three domes ; that in the centre would look a great deal better if it were deeply fluted, like the dome of St. Paul's ; at present it would be much better out of the way, as it gives a general appearance of heaviness, to what would other wise be deservedly thought a very fine building. From the balustrade is obtained a delightful view of the river, and the surrounding country. The centre of the interior of the capitol, is occupied by a large open space under the dome, containing four pictures, that look very well at a little distance : the subjects are the Signing of the Declaration of Independence, the Surrender of General Burgoyne, the Surrender of Lord Cornwallis ; and General Washington resigning his command at Annapolis. They are painted"], [152, "144 SIX MONTHS by Col. Trumbull. The remainder of the capi tol is occupied by the apartments and offices connected with the senate, the house of repre sentatives, and the supreme court of the United States. The pillars which support the roof of the chamber of representatives, are of breccia, or pudding-stone ; perhaps the most singular formation of the kind that is to be found any where, not excepting that at Monserrat in Spain, which is entirely composed of breccia. Frag ments of granite, quartz, limestone, and other rocks, have been pressed together in the most extraordinary manner, by some stupendous power, and from a little distance the composition might be mistaken for the verd antique. It is found on the Potomac, about thirty miles above Washington. The president's house is a hand some building, with an Ionic portico; and the only one in the States that resembles the mo-"], [153, "IN AMERICA. 145 dern residence of a British nobleman. It is exactly at the distance of one mile and a half in a straight line from the capitol, and the houses are continued beyond it for nearly another. Numerous large streets radiate from the capitol and the president's house, as centres \u2014 a method of laying out a city far handsomer than that which has been adopted at Philadel phia, where the streets cross each other at right angles. Who that has seen the \" Perspective \" at Petersburg, can ever forget it? where the principal streets are all pointed towards the beautifully gilt steeple of the Admiralty, that is seen glittering at the end of each of them. It must be allowed that this arrangement has its disadvantages in the shape of the houses, and apartments, one end of which, if they are regularly divided, must be larger than the other."], [154, "146 SIX MONTHS In the dock-yard at Washington, I saw a sixty-gun frigate in a state of forwardness, and a small schooner constructed on a plan that had never been applied to a vessel of war, being of the same shape fore and aft, and having no internal timbers. The blocks made there, are not all of one piece, as they are at our dock-yard at Portsmouth. A double block for instance, is composed of seven pieces of wood, exclusively of the sheave. They are, no doubt, much stronger when made in this manner ; but a man can make but one in half an hour. The college at George Town, adjoining the city, is a Catholic establishment; its members are Jesuits, and who, as usual, are increasing their influence, by purchasing lands, &c. At tached to the college, is the nunnery of the Sisters of Visitation, containing about fifty nuns. They tell there of a Hohenlohe miracle."], [155, "IN AMERICA. 147 Washington, like most of the American cities, can boast of several beautiful rides and walks in its vicinity. Arlington, the seat of George Washington P. Castis, Esq., occupies a most conspicuous and commanding situation, on the south bank of the Potomac. It is visible for many miles, and in the distance has the appearance of a superior English country resi dence, beyond any place I had seen in the States : but as I came close to it, as usual, I was wofully disappointed. It contains a valu able portrait of Washington, when a Major in the British service, and wearing of course the blue-and-buff uniform. Not far from the race ground, and about three miles from George Town, is the residence of a gentleman who has paid greater and more indefatigable attention to the culture of the vine than any other person in America. The vine-"], [156, "148 SIX MONTHS yards around his house produce several different kinds of grapes; from which, considering how few years have elapsed since the attempt was first made, he may be said to have been very successful in producing some very good and palatable wines. Amongst others, the best is dignified by the very aristocratic name of \"Tokay.\" It is made from the \"Catawba\" grape, which he himself first found in a cot tager's garden, not far from a tavern bearing the sign of the Catawba Indians, distant about twenty miles from Washington. From this circumstance he called it the Catawba grape. The Catawba is a river of South Carolina, but no grape of the kind is found near it. The cottagers could give him no satisfactory account of it, and he never could find out whether it was indigenous, or, which is most likely the fact, im ported. It is rather a large grape, thick-skinned,"], [157, "IN AMERICA. 149 but at the same time very transparent, with a fine purple blush, and far more fit for making wine than to form part of a dessert. As yet it appears to thrive better than any kind of grape that has been tried in the United States; so much so, that at Pittsburgh, and Lancaster, and other places where there are vineyards, they have cleared away a large proportion of the European plants, in favour of the Catawba vine. He informed me that he had sent cuttings of it to every State in the Union excepting Florida, Arkansaw, and Kentucky. A long time, how ever, must elapse before the Americans can compete with the wines of Europe : as yet, com paratively speaking, little can be known there, either with reference to the best fruit, or to the soil and temperature necessary to bring it to perfection. Upwards of seventy kinds of the wild vine are found in the American forests, but VOL. I. l"], [158, "150 SIX MONTHS not more than half of them bear fruit. At Boston I tasted a grape called the Isabella grape, whose flavour was still harsh, but was a great and decided improvement in every respect, upon the sourness of the fox-grape of the woods, from which, I was informed, it had been originally produced. I am, of course, speaking of the Catawba and other grapes, only in their wine making capacity ; the grapes raised in the United States for the table, are exceedingly good and very plentiful. As a matter of course, I visited Mount Vernon. A steam-boat conveyed me to Alexan dria in an hour. Alexandria was taken by the British squadron on the 29th of August, 1814, and the stores of flour, tobacco, and cotton, were carried off by them. It contains a population of 9000 persons, and carries on a trade in flour, tobacco, fish, and lumber, to the southern States"], [159, "151 IN AMERICA. and the West Indies, although Baltimore has run away with the greater part of its commerce. A ride of nine miles on a well-shaded road, conducted me to Mount Vernon, now in pos session of John Augustine Washington, Esq., nephew to the General, and to the late Judge, whose worth and learning are recorded by an inscription in the court-house of Philadelphia. Of the house itself there is little to be said. I saw there a piece of an old mug, which bears upon it a small head of the General, said to be the best likeness of him that is known anywhere. From the lawn, there is a fine view of the Potomac with Fort Washington nearly opposite, which was abandoned at the approach of the British squadron in 1814. In passing Mount Vernon, the ships fired a salute it well deserved. I must confess that I was greatly disappointed at the sight of the tomb that contains the ashes l 2"], [160, "152 Sfx MONTHS of Washington. I did not expect grandeur, but I thought to have seen something more respect able than either the old, or the new tomb, to which the coffin was removed two years ago. But for the inscription, I should have taken them for a couple of ice-houses. An avoidance of every thing like pretension is desirable only so long as it is attended with neatness ; \u2014 but there is not even what can be fairly called a path to either of them. Instead of feeling as I wished, whilst in contemplation of the last long home of this really great, because good man, my mind was only occupied by intrusive reflections on the insignificant and pauper-like appearance of the whole scene before me. The tears of La Fayette, when visiting the tomb in 1825, might have partly flowed from other sources than the mere consciousness that he was standing in the presence of the mortal remains of his"], [161, "IN AMERICA. 153 old friend and companion in arms. There has been some talk of removing the coffin to the centre of the hall in the capitol, and of a monu ment to be raised over it, but I have understood that it is not seriously contemplated. If it were placed there, it might one day be the means of saving the Union. How forcible, how effective, in a moment of danger, might be an eloquent appeal to its presence, made by the Judges of the supreme court, or the orators of the American congress ! I was never fortunate enough to hear a mocking bird in its wild state ; I had frequently heard them in cages, but nowhere in such per fection as at Washington. This bird, one of the noblest in nature, is an inhabitant of the southern states only, and is thus described by Wilson, the celebrated Ornithologist. \" The plumage of the mocking bird would scarcely"], [162, "154 SIX MONTHS entitle him to notice, but his figure is well proportioned, and even handsome. The ease, elegance, and rapidity of his movements \u2014 the animation of his eye, and the intelligence he displays in listening and laying up lessons from almost every species of the feathered race within his hearing, are really surprising, and mark the superiority of his genius. He has a voice capable of almost every modulation, from the clear mellow notes of the wood-thrush, to the savage scream of the bald-eagle. In measure and accent, he faithfully follows his originals; in force and sweetness of expression, he greatly improves upon them : his admirable song rises paramount over every competitor. His own native notes are bold and full, and varied beyond all limits. In the height of his song, his ardour and animation appear unbounded \u2014 he sweeps round with enthusiastic ecstasy \u2014 he mounts or"], [163, "IN AMERICA. 155 descends as his song swells or dies away ; and as my friend Mr. Bartram, (an American naturalist), has beautifully expressed it : \" he bounds aloft with the rapidity of an arrow, as if to recover or recall his very soul, expired in the last elevated strain. While thus exerting himself, a by-stander destitute of sight would suppose, that the whole feathered tribe had assembled together, each striving to produce his utmost effort, so perfect are his imitations. He many times deceives the sportsman, and sends him in search of birds that are not within a mile of him, but whose notes he exactly imitates. Even birds themselves are imposed upon by his admirable music, and are decoyed by the fancied calls of their mates, or are driven with precipita tion hito the depths of the forest, at the screams of what they suppose to be the sparrow-hawk.\" He is of a size between the thrush and the"], [164, "156 SIX MONTHS nightingale, but shaped like the latter bird. His plumage in general is of a cinerous brown colour, with a broad bar of white on the wing, which he is very fond of displaying. I am afraid that I never heard them in perfection ; but to judge from what I did hear, I should suppose that although infinitely more varied, his natural notes were neither so full nor so rich as those of the nightingale. But there are many who think differently.\" One morning I was much amused by the debut of a new volunteer corps, calling them selves the Highlanders, \u2014 Washington being one of the flattest places in the States.

I have a great respect for the tartan ; and I thought it might have looked decent, even when converted, as it was, into small-clothes, had they not been made extremely tight. Still, however, the costume of the nether man might have passed unnoticed, had not the enormous bows at the knees been composed of tri-coloured ribbon, and the general effect much heightened by the long nankeen gaiters, which covered the leg from the knee to the shoe. In the capitol, as all the world knows, sit the senate, the house of representatives, and the supreme court of the United States. And here I may be permitted to remark, that when writing generally on such a subject as the United States, every candid person will make allow-"], [166, "158 SIX MONTHS ances for the impossibility of avoiding a repe tition of things already well known and well described. Under the apprehension that I shall frequently be in error on this head, I think the safest mode is to apologise at once, and before hand. None, however, is necessary for not entering at large upon a subject so tedious and so endless, as that of the courts of the different states in their separate capacity as to the federal judiciary. 1 may mention, that the United States are divided into seven judicial circuits, and thirty- two judicial districts. Each state is one district, with the exceptions of New York, Penn sylvania, Virginia, Tennessee, Louisiana, and Alabama; which are each of them divided into two districts. There are three courts belonging to the general or federal government : the district court, the circuit court, and the supreme court. The district court possesses a civil and criminal"], [167, "IN AMERICA. 159 admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, and also takes cognizance of all cases affecting the re venue, and all crimes and offences committed within the district, which are punishable by moderate corporal punishment, or fine and im prisonment.

An appeal lies from his decision in cases where, exclusive of costs, the matter in dispute exceeds the sum or value of fifty dollars, to the \" circuit court,\" possessing an original jurisdiction, civil and criminal. The civil jurisdiction extends to all controversies between citizens of different states, and between a citizen and an alien.

In criminal cases, a point may be reserved for the opinion of the judges of the supreme court, which is sent down to the circuit court to be proceeded upon afterwards. In six of the states, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri, there is no circuit court, because the judges of the supreme court could not find time to sit there twice a year; but the district courts possess the powers and jurisdiction of a circuit court. The supreme court of the United States, is a very high and honourable tribunal, composed of a chief justice, with a salary of 5000 dollars (1125/.), and six associate justices, with a salary of 4500 dollars each, who hold a sitting once a"], [169, "161 IN AMERICA. year, at Washington, commencing on the second Monday in January. The court sits five hours every clay for two months, deciding in that time usually about eighty causes, which are reported as those of the law courts in England used, and ought still to be, by an officer of the court. Its original jurisdiction is confined to all such cases, affecting ambassadors, consuls, and vice consuls, as a court of law can exercise consist ently with the law of nations ; and it has original, but not exclusive jurisdiction of all suits brought by ambassadors, and other public ministers, in which a consul or vice-consul is a party. But its dignity rests chiefly on its appellate jurisdic tion, which extends to all cases and appeals, and writs of error from the circuit courts : likewise in all cases where the constitution and laws of the federal government, or the construction of any treaty entered into by the federal govern-"], [170, "162 SIX MONTHS ment, or its validity, or any right or interest under a treaty, has been a subject of contro versy in the state tribunals. Its decisions and opinions on the construction of the constitution, are the safeguard of the Union. But its appel late jurisdiction is defined, and extends to no cases but where the power is affirmatively given. In order to enable it to issue a mandamus, proof is required that it is an exercise, or necessary to an exercise, of its appellate juris diction. The supreme court has jurisdiction in all controversies where the United States shall be a party in controversies between two or more states ; between a state and the citizens of another state; between citizens of different states; between citizens of the same state claim ing lands under grants of different states; and between a state, or the citizens thereof, and foreign states, citizens, or subjects. A strict and"], [171, "IN AMERICA. 163 admirable attention to justice, is observable in these arrangements. Every description of case which might be partially decided by the courts of the litigant states, is brought to the bar of the great national tribunal to be disposed of. During the last sittings of the supreme court, a case of great constitutional interest was heard before it. It was entitled \" The Cherokee Nation, versus the State of Georgia.\" The Cherokee nation having been repeatedly har assed by the incursions and other unneighbourly proceedings of the inhabitants of Georgia, applied to the supreme court for an injunction to restrain the state, its governor, and other officers, from executing and enforcing the laws of Georgia within the Cherokee territory. The counsel for the Cherokees argued, that not being a state of the Union, the Cherokee nation was to be considered as a foreign state, and was ren-"], [172, "164 SIX MONTHS dered capable of suing in the supreme court by virtue of the clause I have mentioned above, in which the judicial power of the court is extended to controversies between a state and the citizens thereof, and foreign states' citizens or subjects : but Chief Justice Marshall decided, that the relation of the Cherokees to the United States resembled that of guardian and ward ; that they could not be considered either as a foreign state, or as a state of the Union ; and that there fore they were rendered incapable of suing in that court. His judgment was strengthened by the wording of the articles of the constitu tion, in which Congress is empowered to regu late commerce with foreign nations, and the several states and the \" Indian tribes,\" who being in this manner specifically mentioned, could not have been considered as a foreign state or nation by the original framers of the"], [173, "IN AMERICA. 165 constitution. Imagine the astonishment of the poor Cherokees upon being told, that the highest tribunal at the city of their Great Father could afford them no redress. The affair will, of course, come before congress. Chief Justice Marshall decided according to the letter of the constitution ; but the opinion of Chancellor Kent, of New York, is surely deserving of the greatest attention, as containing an exposition apparently more agreeable to justice. He con siders the Indian tribes \" not only as states, but as foreign states, because they do not constitute any ingredient or essential part of our own body politic.\" He considers the clause just referred to, may have contained the additional grant of power to regulate commerce with the \" Indian tribes\" out of abundant caution, and to prevent any possible doubt of the application to them of the power to regulate commerce with M VOL. I."], [174, "166 SIX MONTHS \"foreign nations.\" The last words, he appre hends, would have reached the Indians ; but the constitution, in several other instances, has gone into a like specification of powers which were, by necessary implication, included in the more general grant. Thus, for instance, power is given to congress \" to declare war,\" and it is immediately subjoined \" to grant letters of marque and reprisal.\" They have power to \" coin money,\" and \" to regulate the value thereof:\" they have power \"to raise armies,\" and \" to provide and maintain a navy : \" and it is immediately subjoined \" to make rules for the government \" (and not government only, but it is added) \"and regulation of the army and land force.\" All the judges in the American courts enjoy an immunity from wigs, and the judges of the supreme court alone are clothed in \" silk attire.\""], [175, "IN AMERICA. 167 Their robes are black, and fashioned according to the taste of the wearer. I examined four or five of them which were hanging up in the court, and found that although perfectly judicial, they displayed no small attention to taste in their cut and general appearance. A proper degree of dignity is required and observed in the supreme court ; business is there conducted as it ought to be in every court of justice; but some of the state courts are remarkably deficient in this respect: even in the court-house at Philadelphia, during the sitting of the circuit court, I have seen a gentleman, a counsellor of eminence, coolly seat himself on the table whilst a judgment was being given, and in that attitude I have heard him address some interlocutory observations to the court, and press them upon its attention with great earnestness and ability. I cannot understand why more dignity, both m 2"], [176, "168 SIX MONTHS judicial and forensic, should not be observed in the courts of the United States. I have often been in the company of American lawyers, who, as individuals, were men of gentlemanly man ners, and excellent general information, which they have ever evinced a readiness to impart; but I do not remember one who ever mentioned the subject at all, without admitting that a proper want of the respect due to the time and the place is frequently but too visible in the American courts ; and yet there is no improve ment. Silence, being indispensable, is well pre served; but counsel and attorneys may be oc casionally seen with their legs dangling over the back of a chair, or possibly resting on the table. A corresponding carelessness of manner is of course exhibited by the spectators. I have even observed persons with their hats on"], [177, "IN AMERICA. 169 in court, and upon inquiry have been told they were Quakers; but once or twice I remember having taken the liberty of doubting the infor mation. I hope I shall not be supposed to mean, that no greater decorum is observed in the principal courts of the larger cities than in those held at places of minor importance ; I am speaking of them generally as I found them when in travelling. I happened to arrive at some place where a court was sitting, and \"just dropped in\" for half an hour en passant ; but still there is always a something even in the best of them which, to an English eye, appears undignified and indecorous ; although there can be no doubt that their appearance is not mended by the total absence of wigs and gowns from all of them. The spirit of equality renders it allowable, and the impossibility in distant towns of making"], [178, "170 SIX MONTHS the profession answer by any other arrangement, renders it necessary, that a barrister and solicitor should frequently commence business as part ners, and play into each other's hands. A judge will frequently travel from town to town un attended, in his gig, or on horseback, with his saddle-bags before him, or in the stage-coach, and dine at the village table d'hote with shop keepers, pseudo majors, and advertising attor neys. Human nature will out. In the absence of other titles, it is the pleasure of the Ameri cans that they should be dignified by the rank of General, Colonel, or Aide-de-camp; but more especially I found by that of Major. An Eng lish gentleman assured me that, being on board a steamer on the Ohio river, he was first intro duced by a friend as plain Mr., then as Captain ; soon after he was addressed as Major, and before the end of the day he was formally introduced"], [179, "IN AMERICA. 171 as a General. There is usually a Major, or an Aide, as they call themselves, in every stage coach company. The captain of a steam-boat, who was presiding at the dinner table, happened to ask rather loudly, \" General, a little fish ! \" and was immediately answered in the affirmative by twenty-five out of the thirty gentlemen who were present. One would have imagined, that in the United States, where an equal partition of the rights of mankind is the boasted foundation of the government, Justice would have been treated with peculiar courtesy ; but she is not properly honoured there. Justice is not exclusively a republican in principle, whatever the Americans may think. She must remain unaltered, what ever may be the form of government, as the value of the diamond is the same whether its possessor be a prince or a peasant. During my"], [180, "172 SIX MONTHS occasional visits to the courts of justice in the United States, I could not help thinking how fortunate it was that Justice was blind, and could not therefore be shocked by the want of decorum I observed there. What was my surprise on entering the supreme court in the capitol at Washington, to perceive her wooden figure with the eyes unfilleted, and grasping the scales like a groceress ! With great deference, I would suggest that the whole of this unworthy group should be removed. The day may arrive, as I have said before, when the supreme court may be the means of saving the Union. Any suggestions recommendatory of an amendment or additional clause in the consti tution, emanate from the judges of this exalted tribunal. When it is thought necessary that the constitution of any particular state should be altered or amended, the legislature authorizes"], [181, "IN AMERICA. 173 the people to express their opinions as to whe ther they are or are not in favour of calling a general convention. This is usually arranged at the time of a general election. If there be a majority in favour of the convention, the legis lature then calls upon the people to elect per sons to serve as members or delegates, and it fixes the time of meeting. If any amendments are made by the convention, they are submitted to the people for their approval; and if a ma jority decide upon their adoption, they forthwith become part of the constitution. WThen it is considered that the supreme court has a federal jurisdiction extending over a union of twenty-four states, many of them as large or larger than England, whose humble aud individual importance are increasing, and which are divided and subdivided by party, and by conflicting and annually arising interests, and"], [182, "174 SIX MONTHS which are becoming more and more democratic in every succeeding year, and consequently more and more opposed to the spirit in which the constitution was originally framed, some idea may be formed of the importance that is attached to the decisions of this court, whose authorities, from first to last, are intended as a safeguard to the Union. The independence of this court, and, in fact, of all the federal judi ciary, may be termed the sheet anchor of the United States. Its power constitutes their chief hope ; the abuse of it is the only medium of tyranny, and is therefore the principal source of apprehension. The judges of all the federal courts hold their offices during good behaviour, and are removable only by impeachment. It would reasonably be supposed that the individual states would follow the example of the general government in the appointment of their judges;"], [183, "175 IN AMERICA. but this is not the case. In seven of the states they are elected for a term of years only ; in Rhode Island they are elected annually ; in five of the states they are obliged to go out of office at sixty, sixty- five, or seventy years of age. This law in the enlightened state of New York has deprived it of the valuable services of Chan cellor Kent, the author of the admirable Com mentaries on the laws of America. There are many democrats who actually wish that the judges of the supreme court should be elected for a term of years only. This custom is noto riously productive of sufficient hardships in some of the more remote states, where, on account of the smallness of the salary, amounting to not more than two or three hundred pounds, the bench is sometimes filled by young and inex perienced men, who are the children of party, and whose decisions must be occasionally affected by the hope of re-election."], [184, "176 SIX MONTHS Entailed estates are but little known in the United States : in South Carolina, Georgia, and Louisiana, not at all. In many of the states they are nothing in effect but an estate in fee ; the limitation in tail being of no value, except it be in special tail. But in all cases estates tail may be barred by a simple deed of bargain and sale, and which is, in fact, the almost universal assurance ; lease and release being but little known. In other respects the doctrine of the statutes of uses is in full operation, excepting in the state of New York, where it has been dis continued since the new code passed in 1829. The proceedings of the courts of equity are for the most part similar to those practised in England. Many of the states have chancellors, whose offices are held like those of the other judges. The state of New York had just been obliged to appoint a vice-chancellor, on account"], [185, "IN AMERICA. 177 of the increase of business. The duties of the chancellor, as far as they go, are the same as those of the lord chancellor of England; but in many of the states the jurisdiction in bank ruptcy or insolvency is separate. The terms bankruptcy and insolvency are used indiscrimi nately, although the distinction is of course generally known and understood among lawyers. By the articles of the constitution, the general government is enabled to pass uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcy. No general bank rupt law has, however, been passed, although such a measure has been often contemplated. In the United States a proportion of the people, large beyond that of any other country, is en gaged more or less in traffic of some kind or other in the course of the year, and the difficulty of coming to any equitable decision as to who may or may not be considered a bankrupt, has"], [186, "178 SIX MONTHS been the reason why no general law on the subject has been passed by the federal congress. The states likewise have the power of passing bankrupt laws; but they would only be pro ductive of confusion, as they would not be al lowed to have the effect of rescinding a contract between citizens of different states ; the supreme court having decided that a discharge under the bankrupt or insolvent laws of one state, could not affect contracts made or to be executed in another. As a matter of necessity, the states have insolvent laws of their own, which are generally recognized and respected in all of them as far as they conveniently can be. In some cases the person only, not the debt, is re leased by them ; in others, the debt is discharged, but future acquisitions by gift, devise, or de scent, are liable, though not the produce of future industry. The whole law on the subject"], [187, "IN AMERICA. 179 of bail in the United States is much the same as that of England. A debtor to the United States can only be released by obtaining a release under the United States' insolvent law. In order to be enabled to apply for a release under the insolvent laws of any particular state, a debtor must have resided in that state for a certain period, generally one year; and on the surrender of all property (if he has any), he ob tains a discharge from prison, which is also a dis charge from the debt itself, and as a personal discharge, is respected throughout the Union ; but as a discharge from the debt, it often operates as such only in the state that grants the dis charge. Between citizens of the same state it releases the debt as well as the person ; between citizens of different states, or between a citizen and a foreigner, or between foreigners, the dis charge depends on circumstances. If the suit be"], [188, "180 SIX MONTHS. brought in the courts of any particular state, and the party has been released by the laws of that state, the debt is considered equally cancelled as if the controversy had been be tween citizens of the same state. If the debtor to the United States has applied for, and obtained the benefit of the United States' insolvent law, it can only be in cases where a judgment has been obtained against him, and he has been taken in execution. He must, however, remain in prison for thirty days, and surrender all his property, which he must swear does not exceed thirty dollars, over and above his necessary wearing apparel ; for if he has property beyond that amount, he cannot obtain the benefit of this law. By this dis charge, the person only is released, so that pro perty subsequently obtained from any source is responsible. In all other cases of discharge,"], [189, "IN AMERICA. 181 under the insolvent laws of individual states, before noticed, the person or the debt are dis charged (as mentioned above), but still with the reservation, that all property acquired by descent, gift, or devise, shall be subjected to execution, but not the future acquisitions of the debtor by other means. Fugitive debtors from other countries can be sued and imprisoned only as if they were citizens of America, that is, by exhibiting against them a bailable cause of action. They must remain in prison, if taken immediately on their arrival, until entitled by a residence in the state (usually for one year) to apply for the benefit of the insolvent laws. State citizenship is re quired only in a few of the states, the more general law being, that they may be discharged after a year's residence in the state in which they happen to be sued, whether they have vol. i. N"], [190, "182 SIX MONTHS become citizens or not. Foreigners become citizens of the United States after five years' residence. The acts of naturalization, the last of which was passed in 1816, require that an oath be taken before a state-court by a foreigner of good moral character three years before his admis sion, of his intention to become a citizen, and to renounce his native allegiance ; and at the time of admission he must satisfy the court, that he has resided five or six years, at least, within the United States, and likewise take an oath to renounce and abjure his native allegiance, and to support the constitution of the United States. America is in some respects, a laboratory for the rest of the world. It is the fittest region for experiment. From the first of January, 1832, imprisonment for debt has ceased in the state of New York; the fact is, there is so much more false capital in the United States than in Eng-"], [191, "IN AMERICA. 183 land, that a creditor is not often one dollar the richer for having put his debtor into confinement. The example, if it succeed, will probably soon be followed in Massachusetts, where there is a strong party in favour of a similar experiment. Whilst I was in that state, a meeting was held at Boston, to consider of its propriety ; but the united arguments of many speakers, tended to prove nothing more than what was most probably acknowledged beforehand, by three-fourths of those who heard them, and into which all that can be said on the subject must ultimately resolve itself, namely, that the sufferings of an innocent debtor are highly unjust, and much to be lamented; but that it would be very objection - able to have no means of confining one whose conduct had been fraudulent. By the consti tution of the state of Illinois, imprisonment for debt is disallowed, except in cases of fraud, or n2"], [192, "184 SIX MONTHS the refusal of the debtor to deliver up his pro perty for the benefit of his creditors. The question as to the power of any court or officer to remove a child from his parents on account of their misconduct, remains unsettled; but if either of the parents were dead, and the survivor an unsuitable person to take care of the child, application would be made to the orphan's court, which exists in every state. Its authority resembles that of the lord chancellor in cases of infants being wards of court. Wills, both of real and personal estate, are proved there; and all executors and administrators pass their accounts in this court, from whose decisions an appeal lies to the chancellor. All deeds are by law required to be registered. Wills are proved and witnessed as in England; and a similar law prevents a witness from taking a legacy. A case of fraud used in obtaining a"], [193, "IN AMERICA. 185 will, the only fraud of which the English court of chancery does not take notice, is decided by the chancellor in some states; in others, it is usual to send it, as in England, to a jury. The whole law of mortgage is, generally speaking, much the same as in England. The proceedings in a chancery suit, differ only in the pleadings being a little more simple : a bill for instance, contains merely the stating and interrogating parts, and the prayer. Wit nesses are examined, as in England, upon written interrogatories. The effect of an answer and the mode of using it in court, are also similar. There is no such officer as an accountant- general. Masters in chancery are known only in some of the states. Their duties are some what similar; and matters are referred to any one of them whom the parties may agree upon. In New York, I observed that \" Mr. A. master"], [194, "186 SIX MONTHS. in chancery,\" was almost as frequently to be seen on the door, as the names of a counsellor and solicitor. In those states where there are no masters in chancery, the court has a \" Permanent Auditor,\" who discharges nearly all the duties assigned to the masters in England. The form of an action, the pleadings, and the method of obtaining evidence, are essentially the same as those used in England, generally. In some states the action of ejectment is un known ; in others, it has merely undergone some modification. Real actions, such as writs of right, writs of entry, are much used ; the period of limitation has, however, been altered from that of England. The English law of prescrip tion is acknowledged, with a very few necessarily constitutional exceptions. The period of limita tion allowed in an action of assumpsit, also varies in different states; in some it is three"], [195, "IN AMERICA. 187 years, in others it is six, as in England. Where the action of ejectment is in use, the period of limitation is in some states twenty years, as in England; in others, seven years is thought sufficient. Juries are generally constituted as in Eng land, with the exception of special juries, which are never formed. Throughout the United States a counsellor is allowed to make a speech for the prisoner, and act generally in his behalf, as in a civil cause. Every state in the Union has its rules for the admission of counsellors, solicitors, and attorneys. They generally require that a stu dent shall have studied law with some counsellor for at least three years. On application for an admission as an attorney, the court usually appoints three gentlemen of the bar to examine into the moral and legal qualifications of the"], [196, "188 SIX MONTHS applicant. If he be previously and favourably known to them, the examination is almost no minal. If he be unknown, or be known, but with unfavourable impressions, the examination is proportionality more strict. When admitted as either counsellor or solicitor, he can generally practise in both characters, the distinction being nominal, excepting in the supreme court of the United States, where no person can be counsellor and solicitor at the same time. In the country particularly, it is usual for a lawyer to assume the duties of attorney, conveyancer, proctor, solicitor, and counsellor; but after having prac tised some time, he usually confines himself to the practice of a counsellor only. A barrister and solicitor are frequently partners : as I have before remarked, it would be impossible for any practitioner to obtain a livelihood, excepting in the larger towns, without exercising his abilities"], [197, "189 IN AMEKIl A. in both capacities. For the \"materiel\" of a great part of the foregoing remarks I am in debted to the kind and able assistance of a gen tleman of the Baltimore bar, and I have endea voured that their accuracy should not suffer under my pen. It would be tedious to enter into any detail of the different state constitutions. It is suf ficient to remark, that their affairs are usually administered by a governor, a senate, and a house of representatives. The executive au thority is vested in the governor, who has in some states the benefit of a council. In some states he is elected for a period of four years, but more usually for two. The legislature consists of a senate, and house of representa tives : both, or the latter, are usually elected an nually ; but sometimes for a longer period, with modifications. In the state of Rhode Island."], [198, "190 SIX MONTHS whose government is founded on the provisions of the charter granted to the colony by Charles the Second in 1663, and which is the only state in the Union that has no written constitution; the governor, senate, and judges are elected annually; the members of the house of repre sentatives are elected every six months, or semi annually, as they term it. In general, no other qualifications are required of voters but those of colour, age, sex, and residence. In nearly all the states the right of suffrage is enjoyed by free white citizens, who have resided for one year in the state, and six months in the country. In some of the states, colour is no bar. As to age, that of twenty-one years is the usual requisition. Every voter must of course be a citizen of the United States. Without entering at large upon the hack neyed subject of universal suffrage, it may be"], [199, "191 IN AMERICA. sufficient to remark, that the intrinsic evils of the system are more or less acknowledged by a very large proportion of the better class of Americans, although they of course diminish in the same ratio with the increase of virtue and intelligence; the objection is not merely, that the uncultivated and the ignorant part of the community should be allowed the unqualified right of suffrage ; but it lies in the corrupt influence to which it is open. Both the rich and the poor man have rights to be protected ; but it must be unreason able, that the wealthy and enlightened should be controlled by the needy. The object of my charity goes to the poll ; and not only exercises as much political liberty as myself, but a great deal more ; because the poorer classes being the more numerous, the government is, in effect, under their direction. If in addition to this it be considered, that they must frequently vote in"], [200, "192 SIX MONTHS compliance with the wishes of a superior, it follows, that the most corrupt, or the most suc cessful at intrigue, must enjoy the greatest share of political power. A person who does not in such a country as America, gain some sort of qualification by his industry is, surely, unworthy to be trusted with the right of suffrage. I was informed that votes were very rarely bought with money, and believed it; because where the voters and the candidates are so numerous, the disbursements must be very large, and the difficulty of concealment proportionately in creased. They are rather commanded by con siderations of place ; and it is very evident, that a person who could be influenced by interest in one way, could easily be bribed in another, were it not for the fear of detection. The system of treating is common enough. \"Why, Sir ! \" said an old woman to a gentleman of"], [201, "IN AMERICA. 193 South Carolina, my informant, \" I guess Mr. A. is the fittest man of the two, but t'other whiskies the best.\" The influence of petty demagogues is very great; there being usually two or three in every village. Naturalized foreigners, as a body of voters, possess great power in some places : in New York, where there are said to be nearly 30,000 Irish, their influence over the elections is much complained of. The house of representatives of the United States is composed of members chosen every second year, by the people of the several states. In Virginia and Kentucky they are voted for, viva voce, and not by ballot, as in the other states. At present, one member is returned for every forty thousand persons, five slaves in the slave states counting as three whites. The present number is 216. As the number of re presentatives might lie too large, in consequence"], [202, "194 SIX MONTHS of the increasing population, the constitution provides that the number should not exceed one for every 30,000, but that no state shall be without a representative. As the minimum only is there mentioned, the federal congress has the power of extending the number of electors necessary for the return of a member. The senate of the United States is composed of two members from each state. They are chosen by the legislature of the several states, for the term of six years ; one-third of them being elected every two years. The only qua lifications necessary for a senator are \u2014 that he be thirty years of age, in conformity with the age of the Roman senator ; and that he have been for nine years a citizen of the United States, and an inhabitant of the state for which he is elected. The qualifications required of a member of"], [203, "IN AMERICA. 195 the house of representatives are \u2014 that he be twenty-five years of age ; seven years a citizen of the United States, and an inhabitant of the state where he is chosen. No property qualifi cation is required in either case ; and the conse quence is, that the house of representatives is half filled with young lawyers. The only privi lege it enjoys in its legislative character, which is not shared by the senate, is, that it has the exclusive right of originating all money bills. Chancellor Kent, in his Commentaries, ob serves, \" that the great object of the separation of the legislature into two houses, acting sepa rately, and with co-ordinate powers, is to destroy the evil effects of sudden and strong excitement ; and of precipitate measures, springing from passion, caprice, prejudice, personal influence, and party intrigue, which have been found, by"], [204, "196 SIX MONTHS sad experience, to exercise a potent and dan gerous sway in single assemblies.\" No one can, for a moment, doubt the force of these remarks. It is the best arrangement that can be adopted in a republic : still it is but splitting one pillar into two; the interests and inducements are co-extensive. The senate of the United States and the British house of lords are, or may be, equally influenced by the love of their country, and both are intended for its protection ; but the one is little more than another house of representatives, the other a most essentially distinct part of the government : both are bound by the ties of honour, and the duties of both are defined and exacted byr the constitution ; but those of the house of lords are dictated by the further necessity of consult ing their own security, by a proper and con stant interposition between the throne and the"], [205, "197 IN AMERICA. people. The interests of the one are the same as those of the house of representatives, the only additional power they enjoy consisting of an association with the president, for the pur pose of making treaties, and in the appointment of government officers. The interests of the house of lords are identified with those of the house of commons, not merely with refer ence to property up to an extent usually far exceeding the amount of the qualifications necessary for obtaining a seat in that house ; but they purchase an additional security to the constitution, by obliging the peers of Great Britain to keep a watchful eye on every attempt at encroachment upon the dignity of the crown, their own rank in the country, and their rights as \" hereditary lawgivers.\" In these times, when speculation is afloat, not as to what they will do, but as to what they dare do, how true vol. i. o"], [206, "198 SIX MONTHS should they be to themselves. Their obligations are far more weighty than the \" legal presump tion\" (to use the words of Chancellor Kent, when speaking of the senate with reference to the houses of representatives), \" that the senate will entertain more enlarged views of public policy, will feel a higher and greater sense of national character, and a greater regard for sta bility in the administration ofthe government.\" The president of the United States must be a citizen of the United States, must have attained the age of twenty-one years, and have been fourteen years a resident in the United States. He holds his office for four years. He is elected at the same time as the vice-president, who is president of the senate, but who has no vote, unless the votes be equally divided. The president, vice-president, and all civil officers of the United States, are removed"], [207, "IN AMERICA. 199 from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanours. The president is commander in-chief of the army and navy : he has the power by, and with the advice and consent of the senate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the senators present concur : he can con vene both houses of congress, on extraordinary occasions ; and adjourn them in case of their disagreement as to the time, to any time he may think proper : he appoints ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the supreme court, and all officers of the United States whose appointments are not otherwise provided for by the constitution, and which shall be established by law, &c. &c. The president and vice-president are elected by electors ap pointed in each state equal to the whole number of senators and representatives to which the o2"], [208, "200 SIX MONTHS state may be entitled to in congress; but no senator, or representative, or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States, shall be appointed an elector. The method of choosing these electors is threefold : by the state-legislatures ; by general-ticket ; and by districts. The two latter are more generally preferred, as the choice emanates more directly from the people. Four only of the states, \u2014 Delaware, South Carolina, Louisiana, and Ten nessee, adopt the former. I think it would be tedious and unnecessary to give an analysis of these three methods ; suffice it to remark, I have heard it regretted that the constitution did not limit the choice to one mode. Chancellor Kent says \" there would be less opportunity for dan gerous coalitions and combinations for party, or ambitious or selfish purposes, if the choice of electors were referred to the people at large ; and"], [209, "201 IN AMERICA. this seems now to be the sense and expression of public opinion.\" When the electors have made out the requisite lists, they are sent up to, and opened in the presence of the senate and house of represensatives ; and the president and vice-president are chosen in the manner pre scribed by the twelfth article of the amendments to the constitution. In the year 1801, the fede ralist candidates for the presidency and vice presidency were Mr. Adams and General Pink ney ; the republican favourites were Mr. Jeffer son and Colonel Barr. The two latter obtained a small, but equal majority over the former ; and to decide between them was the allotted office of the house of representatives. Mr. Jefferson was chosen after no less than thirty five trials. In the mean time the people were kept in suspense ; the tranquillity of the Union was endangered : the possibility of a recurrence"], [210, "202 SIX MONTHS of similar difficulties was forcibly impressed upon the minds of Americans; and an alteration of the clause regulating the mode of election of the president and vice-president was resolved upon. The old clause contained these words, \" The person having the greatest number of votes to be president, if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such majority, and have an equal number of votes, then the house of representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for a president, &c.\" The mode of election was altered; but it may still happen that the vote of a single member of the house of representatives may decide it. In President Jackson's Message of December, 1830, he says, that \"the necessity for an amendment is made so clear to his mind by the observation of its evils, and by the"], [211, "203 IN AMERICA. many able discussions which they have elicited on the floor of congress, and elsewhere, that he should be wanting in his duty were he to with hold another expression of his deep solicitude on the subject. A contingency which some times places it in the power of a single mem ber of the house of representatives to decide an election of so high and solemn a character, is unjust to the people ; and becomes, when it occurs, a source of embarrassment to the indi viduals thus brought into power, and a cause of distrust of the representative body. Liable as the confederacy is, from its great extent, to parties founded upon sectional interests, and to a corresponding multiplication of candidates for the presidency, the tendency of the constitu tional reference to the house of representatives is to devolve the election upon that body, in almost every instance ; and whatever choice"], [212, "204 SIX MONTHS may thus be made among the candidates thus presented to them, to swell the influence of particular interests to a degree inconsistent with the general good.\" The election of the pre sident, immediately by the people, without the intervention of electors, is here hinted at. There is a levelling spirit abroad in the United States, that sheds its influence over new laws and insti tutions : if there be a possibility of a tendency towards either the federal or the democratical principles, that tendency is sure to be demo cratical ; and it is by no means improbable, that such a mode of election may, at some future day, be contended for and adopted. Chancellor Kent says, \" that the mode of appointment of the president, presented one of the most difficult and momentous questions that could have occu pied the deliberations of the assembly which framed the constitution ; and if ever the trail-"], [213, "IN AMERICA. 205 quillity of this nation is to be disturbed, and its peace jeopardised by a struggle for power among themselves, it will be upon this very subject of the choise of a president. It is the question that is eventually to 'attest the goodness and try the strength of the constitution, &c.\" Should the mode of election be altered, as I have just supposed it may be, we may bid adieu to the Union forthwith. When we consider the in creasing population of the United States, the immense variety of interests, and that every free inhabitant feels, I may say, personally con cerned, \u2014 whether he be really so or not, \u2014 in the success of his favourite candidate, we can, in some measure, foresee even under the present mode of election, how violent, how convulsing, at no very distant period, will be the struggle and party-feeling exhibited at the election of an officer, whose opinions on the construction of"], [214, "206 SIX MONTHS the articles of the constitution, during his short ascendancy of four years, will affect millions with a sentiment of attachment or disgust. When General Jackson came into office, he imme diately thought proper to turn out several hundred subordinate officers, whose places were filled up by his own party. The number of those who lost their places at the commence ment of any preceding presidency was ex tremely small, bearing no proportion whatever to those dismissed by the General. The in creasing weight and importance of the affairs of the United States rendered it partly a matter of expediency to do so ; and, in all human probability, future presidents will find themselves obliged to follow the example. I make no remark on the late petticoat confu sion in the United States' cabinet; like the battle of Navarino, the best that can be said of it is, that it was an \" untoward event.\""], [215, "IN AMERICA. 207 The salary of the president is 25,000 dollars (5625/.) a year, with the president's house at Washington for his residence ; but his expenses do not equal his income.

The secretaries for state, treasury, war, and navy, and the post master-general, receive a yearly salary of 6000 dollars (1350/.) each, and work very hard for it, their time and attention being fully occupied, and often till a late hour of the night. In the Message of 1830, to which I have before referred, General Jackson invites the attention of congress to the propriety of pro moting such an amendment of the constitution as will render the president ineligible after one term of service ; and yet General Jackson is again a candidate, and most probably a success ful candidate, for the office of president at the"], [216, "208 SIX MONTHS next election, on the first Wednesday in De cember, 1832, preparatory to his taking office for the twelfth presidential term of four years, commencing on the 3d of March, 1833.

His opinions on the tariff question are oracular and uncertain. Mr. Clay is opposed to the removal of the Cherokees ; he is in favour of the renewal of the Bank charter ; he is a Mason ; is an advocate for internal improvements ; and a staunch friend to the protecting, or, as it is called by its sup porters, the American system. Mr. Wirt, a gentleman of Maryland, was the counsel for the Cherokees before the supreme court. He has lately been started as a candidate by the Anti-masons. Since the abduction and supposed murder of William"], [218, "210 SIX MONTHS Morgan, who, a few years since, wrote a book revealing the secrets of Freemasonry, the Anti masons have become gradually more and more numerous.

Mr. Wirt's opinions are supposed to coincide with those of Mr. Clay generally ; but with respect to the internal improvement system, and the tariff question, he is at present un committed. Mr. Calhoun, the vice-president of the day, is the great champion of the interests of the southern states, the nullifiers, and the anti tariff party ; and in that character, if at all, he will be elected to the presidency. His opinions"], [219, "211 IN AMERICA. are in favour of the removal of the Cherokees, and of the existence of the United States' Bank. On the subject of internal improve ments his opinions are said to be changed, he having been originally an advocate of the sys tem when secretary at war in 1819. He is a \" Nullifier,\" although his situation as vice president has prevented him from showing him self in that character so uniformly as he would have done. The term \" nullifier,\" which, like the word \"radical\" in England, has now grown into common use, was first adopted by the mem bers from South Carolina, in congress, about two years ago; the doctrine they profess was broached at the same time. A nullifier is a person who holds that the federal constitution is merely a compact or league between the several states; and that each state has a right to decide for itself concerning the infractions of"], [220, "212 SIX MONTHS that league by the federal government, and to nullify or declare void an act of the federal congress within its limits. Whatever may be urged by the party who are opposed to the opinions of General Jackson, with reference to the advancement of prosperity in the United States by his internal policy merely, his administrations of the affairs of his country with regard to its relations with foreign powers, has certainly been generally successful. He has obtained for her the command of a profitable trade with the British West Indian and North American colonies, thereby settling a question which had already been the subject of six negociations. The president, in his Message, at the second sitting of congress, on the 7th of December, 1830, says, that this desirable result was promoted by the liberal provision of congress, in allowing the ports of"], [221, "213 IN AMERICA. the United States to be open to British shipping before the arrangement could be carried into effect on the part of Great Britain, thereby requiting a similar act of liberality on the part ofthe British government in 1825. He has recovered claims upon the Brazils, Columbia, and Denmark, from which kingdom the payment of 650,000 dollars is secured to the citizens of the United States, for spoliations upon their commerce in the years 1808, 9, 10, and 11. Similar claims upon France, for inju ries during the war, have also been lately ad justed with that power.

By a compact made between the United States and the state of Georgia, on the 24th of April, 1802, and long before any gold mines were thought of, the United States engaged to extin guish for the use of Georgia, \"as early as the same could be peaceably obtained on reasonable terms, the Indian title to the county of Talassee, and to all the other lands within the state of Georgia.\" As gold mines, within two or three years, have been discovered in that state, it has naturally followed, that the inclination of the Indians to remain, and that of the Georgians to get rid of them, has become far more decided than formerly. The Indians (Cherokees) however, claim a voice in the affair of their removal from"], [223, "215 IN AMERICA. the land of their fathers ; and that their asser tions have other foundations than those of an appeal to common justice and humanity, is proved by the fact, that from the 28th of November, 1785, the general government has made with them no less than fifteen different treaties, thereby plainly acknowledging their in dependence, and their capacity and power to treat. Within the last two or three years, how ever, gold, as I have before remarked, has been discovered on the territories of the Indians; and the state of Georgia has applied to the general government to fulfil the contract, and rid them of the Cherokees. The general government would be willing to come to a proper arrangement with the Cherokees, but they are unwilling to go. The number now left is about 15,000; the remainder of the tribe, since the year 1 809, having acceded to the offer i>2"], [224, "216 SIX MONTHS of the United States, and removed to the lands provided for them beyond the Mississippi. When this part of the tribe petitioned to be allowed to remove, the answer of the president (Mr. Madison) contained the words, \"those who are willing to remove may be assured of our patronage, our aid, and our good neighbour hood.\" The Georgians, however, happen to think that this is just the time for them to go, and they forcibly prevent them from digging for gold on their own land, saying, that every year will but increase their anxiety to remain ; and that they have no right to dig for gold when the reversion of the land is in the state. These disputes yet remain unsettled. The Cherokees are far advanced in civil ization; and have among them men of very superior abilities. They adopt in part the costume of Europeans ; they have schools, and"], [225, "IN AMERICA. 217 churches, and a printing press among them ; and were fully competent to understand the following precious piece of humbug, forming part of President Jackson's message to congress, in 1830. \" Humanity has often wept over the fate of the aborigines of this country ; and philanthropy has been long busily employed in devising means to avert it; but its progress has never for a moment been arrested, and one by one have many powerful tribes disappeared from the earth. To follow to the tomb the last of this race, and to tread on the graves of extinct nations, excites melancholy reflections. But true philanthropy reconciles the mind to these vicissitudes, as it does to the extinction of one generation to make room for another. In the monuments and fortresses of an unknown people spread over the extensive regions of the west, we behold the memorials of a once"], [226, "218 SIX MONTHS powerful race, which was exterminated, or has disappeared, to make room for the existing savage tribes, &c. &c. The tribes which occu pied the countries now constituting the eastern states, were annihilated or have melted away to make room for the whites. The waves of population and civilization are rolling to the westward ; and we now propose to acquire the countries occupied by the red men of the south and west, by a fair exchange, and at the ex pense of the United States, to send them to a land where their existence may be prolonged and perhaps made perpetual. Doubtless it will be painful to leave the graves of their fathers ; but what do they more than our ancestors did, or than our children are now doing ? To better their condition in unknown lands, our forefathers left all that was dear in earthly objects; our children by thousands yearly leave the land of"], [227, "IN AMERICA. 219 their birth to seek new homes in distant regions. Does humanity weep at these painful separations from every thing animate and inanimate with which the young heart has become entwined ? Far from it! It is rather a source of joy that our country affords scope where our young population may range unconstrained in body or in mind, developing the power and faculties of man in their highest perfection. These remove hundreds and almost thousands of miles at their own expense, purchase the lands they occupy, and support themselves at their new home from the moment of their arrival. Can it be cruel in this government, when, by events which it cannot control, the Indian is made discontented with his ancient home, to purchase his lands, to give him a new and extensive territory, to pay the expenses of his removal, and support him a year in his new abode? How many thousands"], [228, "220 SIX MONTHS of our own people would gladly embrace the opportunity of removing to the west on such conditions. If the offers made to the Indians were extended to them, they would be hailed with gratitude and joy. \"And is it supposed that the wandering savage has a stronger attachment to his home than the settled, civilized Christian ? Is it more afflicting to him to leave the graves of his fathers, than it is to our brothers and children ? Rightly con sidered, the policy of the general government towards the red man, is not only liberal but generous. He is unwilling to submit to the laws of the states, and to mingle with their population. To save him from this alternative, or, perhaps, utter annihilation, the general go vernment kindly offers him a new home; and proposes to pay the whole expense of his re moval and settlement.\""], [229, "221 IN AMERICA. I will here introduce a few remarks on what is called the gold region in the United States, with the kind assistance of Mr. Damm, a Swe dish gentleman resident at New York, and con nected with the gold mines. I have selected them, with a very few alterations, from the reports on the subject lately published by the govern ment. It is now about thirty years since gold was discovered in North Carolina; it was found in the sand and gravel of different water-courses, first in Cabarras county, soon afterwards in a county of Montgomery in that state. Until within a few years past, the process of washing for gold was principally confined to the two counties just named. The greater portion of the gold thus procured was found in small pieces, varying in size from one pennyweight down to particles of extreme minuteness ; at most of the mines, however, it is not uncommon to"], [230, "222 SIX MONTHS find pieces of a much larger size ; for example, at Cabarras, a single piece has been found weighing twenty-eight pounds avoirdupois, be sides several other pieces varying from four to sixteen pounds. The proprietor of the same mine affirms, that about a hundred pounds avoir dupois have been found in pieces, about one pound in weight; these large pieces, however, compose but a small portion of the whole pro duct of the mines. At a mine in Montgomery county, a number of pieces of about one pound weight have been found. One of them weighed four pounds eleven ounces, and another three pounds. In Anson county, during the summer of 1828, a piece of gold weighing ten pounds, another of four pounds weight, together with a number of small pieces, were taken up out of the sands and gravel of Richardson's creek. These dis-"], [231, "IN AMERICA. 223 coveries have been chiefly made in or near beds of streams; but in some instances deposits of considerable extent have been found on the sides and tops of hills. It was not, however, until about six years ago, that the gold mines, properly speaking, were discovered in North Carolina, that is, gold in regular, well-defined veins. This discovery, like that of the alluvial deposits, was in some measure accidental. A person, while washing the sand and gravel of a small rivulet for gold in Montgomery county, observed that he could never find it beyond a certain spot in ascend ing the stream ; but at the point where the gold seemed to cease, he discovered a quartz vein running into the hill on one side of the channel, and at right angles with the course of the rivulet. Having frequently taken up out of the bed of the stream, pieces of quartz with bits of gold"], [232, "224 SIX MONTHS attached to them, he came to the conclusion that the gold found scattered below, must have come out of the vein of quartz ; and he deter mined to pursue it into the hill. He had done so but for a few feet, when he struck a beauti ful deposit of the metal in a matrix of quartz, and subsequently another in carbonate of lime. In following this vein about thirty or forty feet longitudinally, and at a depth of not more than fifteen or eighteen feet, he found a succession of what are technically termed nests, from which he took out more than 15,000 dwt. of virgin gold. Soon afterwards the mine fell into other hands; and the working of the vein has been discontinued in consequence of the quantity of water which made its appearance ; though it is understood that it will be resumed in a short time. This discovery of the metal in regular veins, presented the subject in a new and in-"], [233, "IN AMERICA. 225 teresting point of view; and directed a search for gold among the hills and high grounds, and particularly for veins traversing the earth. In the course of the summer, after the de velopement of Barringer's mine, some valuable mines were discovered in Mecklenburgh county. The product of these, worked in the rudest manner, without skill or capital, was so great as to excite general notice ; and stimulated the land-owners in that section to search for these hidden treasures. The mines now began to attract the attention of the public; and several persons of enterprise, and some capital, repaired to the spot. Some of them made investments, began to erect machinery, and worked the veins with system and regularity. The success of the first adventurers in this new enterprise, and for a time the attention of every body who sought to engage in the mining business, was"], [234, "226 SIX MONTHS exclusively turned towards Mecklenburgh county. The consequence was, a constant search for gold was kept up in that county, and not unattended with success, as many very promising veins were discovered. These Mecklenburgh mines were the first that attracted attention ; and the first that were examined and worked with skill and management. They were, of course, greatly in advance of every other part of the region, and the products have been greater in proportion to the labour, and capital, and skill that have been applied to them. In the course of the succeeding year, a very extensive and rich vein was discovered in Guil ford county ; and it was soon operated upon by more than one hundred hands, who flocked in from the country around, and received permis sion to dig there. The discovery of one vein in a district, furnishes the means of finding others."], [235, "227 IN AMERICA. The people ofthe neighbourhood visit it, examine the appearances of the ores, and other signs and indications, and thus in some degree are quali fied to make a search on their own lands or elsewhere. This was the case in Guilford county ; the discovery of the first vein was soon followed by the opening of several others. The same plan will be followed in every district, until the gold region be explored, and the places which exhibit any external signs of gold be thoroughly known. About this time Cabarras county, which had hitherto been only considered as productive in its washings, was ascertained to be a vein-mining district; and discoveries to the same effect were made about the same period at Lincoln. It is less than two years and a half ago, since gold in veins was first discovered in Davidson county; it having previously been found only"], [236, "228 SIX MONTHS in and near the beds of rivulets and creeks. Within the last few months, veins have been opened in the adjoining county of Randolph. Rowan, situated between Davidson and Cabarras counties, embraces a considerable section of the gold region, and contains many veins whose external appearance is good and promising. The metal is also found in the streams : some few veins have also been opened in Tredell county, and are now in a course of developement. While progress had been thus making in opening veins, and in ascertaining their situa tions, some valuable discoveries of stream deposits occurred in a section of the state of North Carolina, hitherto not suspected to be within the range of the gold region. In Burke county, one of the most mountainous of the state, and one, two, or more feet under the surface, a layer of sand and gravel is found, varying from a"], [237, "229 IN AMERICA. few inches, sometimes to more than a foot, in thickness ; in this layer the virgin gold is found, generally in small particles about the size of a pin's head, and very often as large as a grain of corn ; it is separated, and collected from the accompanying matter, by washing. Water is abundant ; and the absence of clay and adhesive matter in the auriferous layer, makes the pro cess of washing exceedingly easy. A nnmber of these deposits have already been found, and some of them have proved to be very productive. It may be here mentioned, that in the adjoining county of Rutherford, gold in deposit has also been found; but as yet, not much labour has been expended in that quarter. One vein, which is very encouraging, has been worked regularly; another vein of good expectations has been discovered. In short the veins and places of deposit are vol. i. a"], [238, "230 SIX MONTHS very numerous, and scattered over the whole country, with a few exceptions ; and the gold which is produced finds a market so readily, that it is difficult to give a very correct estimate of the product of mines of the Carolinas, Virginia, and Georgia ; but it was said to amount to 500,000 dollars in 1830, from North Carolina alone. During that year, nearly the whole gold coinage of the United States' mint, was from native gold. The coinage was 643,105 dollars in gold coin : of this, 125,000 was derived from Mexico, South America, and the West Indies ; 19,000 from Africa, 466,000 from the gold region of the United States, and about 33,000 from sources not ascertained. Of the gold of the United States above mentioned, 24,000 may be stated to have come from Virginia, 204,000 from North Carolina, 26,000 from South Caro lina, and 212,000 from Georgia."], [239, "231 IN AMERICA. It may not be out of place here to remark, that hereafter the quantity of domestic gold that will be received at the mint, will bear a less proportion to the whole amount found, than has been the case heretofore ; the reason is this : hitherto, Philadelphia may be said to have been nearly the only market for the article ; goldsmiths and merchants at New York, and other cities in the Union, were unacquainted with it; and there fore for fear of deception, dealt but little in it; this occasioned the greater part of the gold to be taken to Philadelphia, where, if not sold to the goldsmiths or merchants, it was deposited in the mint ; so that at all events a portion of it always contrived to reach that establishment. But now the case is different : a market for the gold is opening in most of the cities of the United States ; goldsmiths and jewellers, having ascer tained its comparative purity, which is said to 2 2"], [240, "232 SIX MONTHS be greater than that of the gold of Mexico or the Brazils, will generally become purchasers for their own use. That there will be an increase in the pro ducts of the mines every succeeding year, admits of very little doubt, when the gradual enlargement of the gold region, extending through Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia \u2014 the number of persons turning their attention to the business \u2014 the mills that are now erecting in various places \u2014 the improve ments in the mode of working and general management, are made the subject of consi deration. The improvements in machinery have been considerable within the last two years : it is believed, however, that as yet they are far from being perfect. The defects in the present mode of extracting the gold are well known"], [241, "233 IN AMERICA. to those most extensively engaged in the busi ness ; and some of the miners, even at this time, are turning their attention towards the introduction of other methods, promising more economy and greater results. Grinding the ore in water with the vertical stone, which is the method practised in Chili, is now the process most generally used; but the liabilities of the vertical, or Chilian mill, to become disor dered \u2014 the waste of gold and quicksilver \u2014 the irregularity of results from the same ores \u2014 the want of proper checks on the workmen, together with minor objections, will probably, in a few years more, cause these mills to be in a great measure discontinued, except in small establishments, and for certain classes of ores in the larger ones. The auriferous veins of North Carolina and Virginia have not yet been sufficiently deve-"], [242, "234 SIX MONTHS loped. As yet not a single shaft in the whole range of country (except at the Charlotte Mine, near a smalltown of that name, worked under the direction of the Chevalier de Rivafinoli) has been carried down to the depth of a hundred feet. Seventy to eighty feet is the greatest depth yet attained ; and thirty feet is more than an average on the main excavation : as far, however, as these experiments have gone, they furnish no reason to doubt the durability of the mines ; for thus far, the well-defined veins not only retain their first size, but, in many cases, become larger, and more often than otherwise, improve in richness. This circumstance has given rise to an idea among the common work men, that the vein grows richer about the time it reaches water. On the whole, when it is considered, that in Mexico, Saxony, and other great mining districts, veins have been success-"], [243, "IN AMERICA. 235 fully followed downwards more than 2500 feet ; the probability that the veins in the United States will improve, is, at least, as great as that they will become poorer. Nor is it in the nature of things, that any considerable portion of the whole number of veins existing there, much less all of them, have already been discovered. The usual way that discoveries are made, is to take some of the earth or gravel lying on the top of the rocks, and wash it in an iron pan. If any fine particles of gold are found, the vein is known to be auriferous, and its degree of richness and value is judged of by a variety of circumstances. This fine gold without doubt comes out of the vein, the top of which had been disintegrated, and fallen to pieces. There are many bold veins in every ' district, the tops of which show no gold, whilst other indicating"], [244, "236 SIX MONTHS substances are abundant. The probability is, that some of them at a greater depth may prove highly auriferous. Reviewing all that has been said on the subject, it will be seen that the whole business is yet in its infancy ; and the only cause for wonder is, that so much has been done in so short a time. Ignorance and prejudice were to be overcome, and ridicule was liberally bestowed on the few who engaged in the business. If the work proceed as rapidly for some years to come, as it has for the three years past, the changes in the appearance of things will become very striking. There are some persons of intelligence, mostly however at a distance, who seem to apprehend that the mines of the United States will produce consequences similar to those that followed to Spain and her colonies from the discovery of the mines of South"], [245, "IN AMERICA. 237 America and Mexico. Without stopping to inquire how far these consequences were occa sioned by the mines of the New World, it may be remarked with truth, that no sort of analogy is to be found in the condition and circumstances of the two countries ; and that neither the states man nor the philosopher need anticipate that the results will be similar. That great effects will be produced is beyond question : and these will show themselves in the increasing prosperity of the country. Among the advantages that will follow from the develope ment of the mines, is the encouragement they give to agriculture, in the withdrawal of some of its surplus labour, and giving it new employ ment. They will create home markets for the surplus products of the farmer ; and this will encourage him to improve his farm, and increase the productiveness of his lands. As yet, this"], [246, "238 SIX MONTHS influence has not been much felt; but a close observer may see that the improvement has commenced, though it will not be generally perceptible until the division of labour more fully takes place between the farmer and the miner. Mining and farming are two very different pur suits; and farmers will soon see that it is pru dent for them to stick to the plough, and sell or let the auriferous veins to the miner. An important change will also take place (at a very distant period) in the staples of the gold country ; cotton will be less and less culti vated in the mining districts ; while the bread stuff, farinaceous, succulent vegetables \u2014 and stock, will claim the chief attention. This change in the staples of the agriculturist, will in itself produce important results. The opening of the mines, and the prospect of profitable employment, will in some degree check that"], [247, "239 IN AMERICA. spirit of emigration which has been carrying off so many enterprising and useful citizens, and will bring into the country men of wealth intelli gence, business habits, and general enterprise. The opening of the mines has been attended with one primary and bad effect ; that of creating a mania for speculation. The usually attendant failures and mishaps will co-operate with other causes, to throw the mines into the hands of a distinct class of men, who, having a knowledge of the business, and having capital at command, will eventually conduct all the mining operations in the country. Whether the effects be good or bad, their influence will not be confined to North Carolina. It will be felt in Virginia, South Carolina, and Georgia, \u2014 the people in the upper parts of these states having far more interest in the mines than is generally supposed."], [248, "240 SIX MONTHS When the cheapness of obtaining the timber necessary for machinery, the certainty of labour, and the security of property under such a government as that of the United States, are deeply considered; these mines might be far more worth the attention of an English company than many a scheme in which English capital is already embarked.

By the articles of the constitution, the powers of the federal government, with reference to its expenditure of the national funds upon internal improvements in the Union, are confined to the establishment of post-offices and post-roads. On the 27th May, 1830, in the firm persuasion that the words 'post-roads' could apply only to those which might prove of general benefit to the citizens of the Union, and not to those which conferred an advantage only upon the in habitants of any particular state, a bill entitled \" An Act authorising a subscription of stock in the Maysville, Washington, Paris, and Lexing ton turnpike road Company,\" was returned by the President to the house of representatives, without having received his signature. In the veto by which it was accompanied, he shows"], [250, "242 SIX MONTHS that \"grants for internal improvements from the national treasury, have been made profess edly under the control of the general principle, that the works which might be thus aided should be of a general, not local \u2014 national, not state character ; and that a disregard of this distinction would of necessity lead to the subversion of the federal system. The road in question had no regard to any general system of improvements, and was exclusively without the limits of the state ; starting at a point on the Ohio river, and running out sixty miles to an interior town, and even as far as that state was concerned, of partial, not general advantage.\" In another part of tho veto he adds, \" that if it be the desire of the people, that the agency of the federal govern- ment should be confined to the appropriation \u25a0 of money in aid of such undertakings in virtue of state authority ; then the occasion, the manner,"], [251, "IN AMERICA. 243 and the extent of the appropriations, should be made the subject of constitutional regulation.\" In about three years, the national debt of the United States will be paid off, and the govern ment will find itself in possession of a surplus revenue of ten or twelve millions of dollars. To divide it amongst the states, will be unconsti tutional, because it will render the states too de pendent on the favour of the federal government ; and as it is collected chiefly by means of the tariff, it cannot cease to exist so long as the tariff remains in force. Without a limited and defining authority, arising from a constitutional adjustment of this power of distribution upon equitable principles, it is beyond a doubt that neither Mr. Clay, nor any other person who may be president, could give any thing like universal satisfaction amid the \" scramble for appropriations,\" \u2014 as the"], [252, "244 SIX MONTHS veto has it, \u2014 which could not but ensue upon the conflicting and uncontrollable variety of interest that is annually increasing in the American community. The progress of reform in England, and in Europe generally, is watched with the most intense interest by the Americans. A deep feeling of regard and sympathy for the mother country, as they term it, is still general, and I think increasing; and though most of the Americans believe their own country is the first in the world, they are still reasonable enough to assign to Great. Britain the second place in the scale of nations. Those airs which it must be admitted so frequently render an Englishman ridiculous, when travelling on the old continent, would be entirely thrown away in the United"], [253, "IN AMERICA. 245 States.

They wish us well through our troubles, and watch with sincere pity what they consider to be the approaching downfal of our constitution : but at the same time their national vanity receives something very like gratification from the belief, that we shall be forced to adopt a form of government similar to their own.

The American constitu tion has never been tried. That it was nearly a bankrupt at the close of the last war, was a trial of the resources of the country, not of its institutions. Forty years is no time to test the strength of a government like that of the United States, when civilization is extended over so small a proportion of them. The good is perceived at present; the evils are latent, and compara-"], [255, "IN AMERICA. 247 tively little felt. But there are among the institutions of the Union, the seeds of discord and confusion, whose growth is only stifled by the bustle of commercial pursuits, and that panacea for every political disease, a fine country abounding in resources, and of small population in comparison to its extent. It is possible that the mischief will not be felt, so long as there is no real motive for disaffection ; so long in fact as the people are not in want, which may not be the ease while ground yet remains to be cultivated. In England and America universal suffrage would be alike only in name.

Supposing the blood to be shed, and the horrors to be passed through, that must be shed and passed through before the experiment of a commonwealth could be again tried in England, is it possible that it could exist, situated as Great Britain is with reference to the other powers of Europe, without an unemployed standing army ? and then again, is it possible that it could exist with one ?

By what then is it probable that the career of the Union will be disturbed ? Are not wealth and luxury to have their due weight? It is to the credit of the Americans, that individual wealth has never yet been employed for any un constitutional purpose ; but it is nevertheless true, that an aristocracy is most undeniably springing up in every city of the Union. In the course of time many large fortunes will be amassed, and opulent families will be distributed throughout the country. It will be but in the spirit of human nature, that a person in posses sion of what in common American would be termed \" an elegant location,\" should wish to have upon it a better house than his neighbours, and that another should wish to have a still"], [261, "253 IN AMERICA. better ; and is it to be believed that the head of a rich and ambitious family will be for ever, as now, restrained by the voice of public opinion from doing his utmost to prevent a fine place from going out of his family? Can the inclination remain in thraldom, and the man be said to enjoy liberty? Will not one example be followed as a precedent by five hundred others ? and will not an hereditary aristocracy be produced in this manner? The system of entails in England is consi dered by the Americans as highly pernicious ; but their idea of its extent is far beyond the truth. On this head I have heard great ignor ance displayed by them. Some think that an entailed estate cannot be destroyed at all; but that an entailed estate cannot, in any case, be destroyed without the consent of the eldest son, is the more common error ; one which is pre valent with the uninitiated even in England,"], [262, "254 SIX MONTHS and is, of course, still more so among the Americans, who are but little aware that an estate cannot, in any case, be rendered un alienable for more than one generation; or, technically speaking, for more than a life or lives in being, and twenty-one years afterwards. This rule has been a favourite with English lawyers, because, on the one hand, it pre vents landed property from being unavailable for commercial purposes for a longer period than one generation; and, on the other, it makes reasonable allowance for the English policy of keeping up the families of our nobi lity and gentry. From whence then does the vulgar error principally arise? From this cir cumstance : under the usual form of settlement, the father has the present enjoyment of the estate, and the son has the inheritance in tail in expectancy ; and in this case the father"], [263, "IN AMERICA. 255 and son, as soon as the latter is of age, may do what they please with the estate; and it is a very common arrangement for them to agree to make a fresh settlement, which ties up the estate for another generation. But this is only an exercise of their absolute power of disposal, which they might, if they pleased, exercise by selling the estate, or other wise getting rid of it. If no fresh settlement has been made, and the son outlives the father, he alone may do what he pleases with the estate, without asking the consent of his eldest son or of any other person. The Americans are little aware that there is not a nobleman's estate in the country, with the exception of Blenheim, Strathfieldsay, and perhaps half a dozen others, where the reversion is in the crown under some very old grant, which could not be absolutely disposed of, once, at least, in"], [264, "256 SIX MONTHS every generation. That there is a power of making unalienable entails in Scotland, (with irritant and resolutive clauses, as the Scotch lawyers have it), where the person making them is not indebted at the time, is a truth which I do not conceive could have given rise to the error respecting those in England. The proceedings at the next session of con gress will be of the utmost importance, and before this work be out of the press, the tariff question will probably have given rise to as much angry discussion as has ever been heard within the walls of the capitol. The tariff, that is to say, the principle of effectual protection to domestic industry, is supported by about two-thirds of the American people. Manufactures sprung up during the late war, and millions of dollars have since been"], [265, "IN AMERICA. 257 invested in them on the faith of the tariff. After the conclusion of hostilities, the war duties were repealed generally ; but some of them were continued for the protection of domestic indus try. This was effected in 1816, and by the influence of the southern votes ; and, strange as it may appear, was especially supported by the members of South Carolina; whilst the northern members were not generally partial to the measure. The southern states at that period, were averse to the expense of a naval establishment : they disliked foreign commerce, because it tended to embroil the country in disputes with the European powers, and they were therefore friendly to a moderate tariff. In 1824, additional protection was given to manu factures. It was opposed by New England and the south, and supported by the middle and western states. In 1828, still further protection"], [266, "258 SIX MONTHS was given, notwithstanding a violent opposition from the southern states, who now felt the error they had been guilty of. The tariff question, then, is simply this. The northern states are manufacturers ; the southern states are cotton growers. The southern states have never objected to such duties on imported foreign manufactures, as would be sufficient for the purposes of a revenue equal to the government expenditure ; but beyond what is necessary for the attainment of that object, they are entirely averse to the tariff, because Great Britain does not buy so much of their cotton as she would if her manufactured goods were not excluded from the markets of the United States, by means of the protecting duties. The inhabitants of South Carolina are most violently opposed to the tariff. One-third of them would, if they could, secede from the Union immediately."], [267, "IN AMERICA. 259 In the year 1823, the crop of cotton amounted to 420,000 bales.

Certainly, if ever there was a country upon earth where the principles of free trade could be allowed an existence, that country is the states of North America, so long as they remain united. When we contemplate their unbounded re sources, and their endless extent, we must admit that they afford scope for a species of energy altogether without present parallel in the old continent ; and it is difficult to believe, that free trade should not be a part of their system, not only because it would correspond with the boasted freedom of their institutions, but on account of the certainty of benefit they would"], [268, "260 SIX MONTHS ultimately derive from it.

The settlement of disputes arising from the differences of soil and climate, in themselves uncontrollable by legislative interference, must be a subject far more difficult to grapple with, than that which merely relates to internal im provements, which may be assisted by an alte ration of the constitution. Many Americans will probably tell you as they have told me, that the Union is becoming stronger and stronger ; they will assure you that there is a growing conviction, that the complaints of the southern states are without foundation, that their suffer ings are chiefly imaginary, and that their citizens"], [269, "IN AMERICA. 261 will, sooner or later, come to the same opinion ; that four-fifths of all the articles that are taxed, either heavily or lightly, are consumed in the northern, western, and the tariff states, while at the same time a home market exists for from 150,000 to 200,000 bales of the best cotton of the southern states, at the best prices : that the party war which rages in newspapers throughout the Union, means nothing at all; and that, to use the quotation so well applied by Mr. Adams in his last 4th of July oration, delivered at Quincey, near Boston, \" We angry lovers mean not half we say.\" It is probable that some part of what is said by an American country newspaper on the subject of party, may be nonsense ; but one cannot help being a little less sceptical, when higher authorities, and the proceedings of public meetings, are consulted, which, if we are to judge by the excitement they occasion, are not vol. i. s"], [270, "262 SIX MONTHS quite a farce, whatever county meetings may be in England.

If there be any point on which the ( I was going to say southern section, but to avoid, as far as possible, the painful feelings such discussions are calculated to excite, I shall say) weaker of the two sections is unanimous, it is that its prosperity depends in a great measure on free trade, light taxes, eco nomical and, as far as possible, equal disburse ments of the public revenue, and an unshackled industry; leaving them to pursue whatever may appear most advantageous to their interests.

In three years the national debt of the United States will be paid off, and the government will find itself in possession of a surplus revenue of 10,000,000 or 12,000,000 of dollars, chiefly arising from the tariff duties.

Mr. Calhoun recommends, that the money should be left in the pockets of the people, and affirms that there is but one \" effectual cure \u2014 an honest reduction of the du ties to a fair system of revenue, adapted to the just and constitutional wants of the government, and that nothing short of this will restore the coun try to peace, harmony, and mutual affection.\""], [277, "IN AMERICA. 269 The example of good citizenship displayed by Massachusetts during the existence of the embargo in 1807, is now referred to as worthy of imitation by the southern states; a total stagnation of the trade of that state was the consequence of the Berlin decree, and the re taliatory orders in council of the British govern ment ; and in the opinion that the embargo was unconstitutional, the question was tried before the supreme court of the United States, who decided in favour of the authority of the general government.

I would instance Mr. Head's table at Philadelphia, as the best in the United States. There was a quiet gentle manlike style about it, that I never saw surpassed, or hardly equalled, by a table d'hote in any country. I wish I could speak as well of the bed-rooms in that respect; I much prefer those at Mr. Barnum's at Baltimore, and Mr. Gadsby's at Washington. Take it altogether, the Tremont at Boston, is by far the best hotel in the States. Ice is to be had in the greatest plenty in all parts of the United States ; I have even found it as a luxury at my toilette. On the subject of eating ices, I found that nobody would touch a water ice, and that in general cream ices only were to be met with, even at the best shops.

The Temperance Societies are an honour to the country. There are about 1000 of them in the United States, composed of 1 ,200,000 members, and affecting about 2,000,000 of individuals directly or indirectly. They have caused the suppression of 1000 distilleries, and 3000 retail stores. The members solemnly promise that they will not touch a drop of any kind of spirits : of course, the rules of the so ciety are sometimes broken, particularly as they allow wine and brandy when ordered by the doctor.

The English and American ideas of the picturesque are widely different. The Englishman, who sees enough of cultivation in his own country, travels to other lands in search of wilder scenery, and gazes with de light on the immense forests of America. The American would readily dispense with the ro mantic, and wonders that every body is not like himself, an admirer, by preference, of a rail road, a canal, or a piece of newly cleared vol. ii. B"], [298, "2 SIX months. ground. Excellent as these are in their way, I really believe that the Americans, of the mid dle and lower class, regard them not merely with reference to their beneficial effects, but as the ne plus ultra of the beautiful. When I inquired which was the prettiest road towards Harper's ferry, \" Go by such a road,\" was the reply; \"it runs by the side of the canal, sir.\" However, it so happened that the canal road lay also along the bank of the Potomac, and the scenery certainly was very pretty. At a distance of two miles from the road, and thirteen or fourteen from Washington, are the Great Falls of the Potomac. I did not turn out of my way to see them ; I have seen a great many, and purposed visiting Niagara. After all I had heard, I must say, that I was disappointed with Harper's ferry. The Shenandoah and Potomac rivers unite at the"], [299, "3 IN AMERICA. foot of the Blue Mountains, through which they have forced, or rather worn a passage ; but the rivers are of the same width. The mountains, composed of limestone, and schistose rocks, are of moderate and uniform elevation, and they appear to be perfectly acquiescent, while the stream glides in silent triumph over its smooth though rocky channel, without the least appear ance of exasperation. I visited the United States' arsenal, con taining 70,000 stand of arms. The chief ar mourer was an old Englishman, who served at the battles of Alexandria and Trafalgar. I observed that, with the exception of the ramrod and touchhole, which was of brass, every part of the musket, lock, barrel, and bayonet, was browned. They were not ranged in order, as in other arsenals, but were kept in boxes, so that there was no display whatever. From the b 2"], [300, "4 six MONTHS arsenal I proceeded to Captain Hall's manufac tory of patent rifles. With one of these, after a little practice, a man may load and fire eight or nine times in a minute. The arrangement is very simple. The barrel appears to have been divided from the breech with a fine saw. The breech is raised by means of a hinge and a spring, which is struck by the hand, and when loaded is immediately shut down, so as to form part of the barrel, similar to that of a screw pistol. The great advantage gained by the in vention of this rifle is, that with it a soldier can load, and defend himself with his bayonet at the same time. There are also some large saw mills here well worth the attention of the traveller. I proceeded up the well-cultivated valley of the Shenandoah, and arrived at Winchester, a neat and considerable town; thence to a good"], [301, "IN AMERICA. 5 inn in the middle of the forest. In my way I crossed the sandy ridge and the Capon Moun tains, though they hardly deserve such a name, being, to all appearance, scarcely higher than the Wrekin in Shropshire. I breakfasted at Romney, a pretty village on the south bank of the Potomac. A little farther on, the road is frowned upon by an overhanging rock of bastard lime-stone : its appearance is very singular. The strata are disposed in arches one within the other, so that, with the aid of fancy, its surface may be thought to resemble the solid frame work of a stupendous bridge. The highest arch, to which the others are parallel, is nearly semi-circular with a radius of 270 feet. When the mail, in which I was travelling, arrived at the north branch of the Potomac, we found it so swollen by the late rains that a passage seemed not only dangerous but imprac-"], [302, "6 SIX MONTHS ticable. The coachman, however, a cool and determined fellow, crossed over on horseback; he then returned, placed one of the passengers on the near leader, and resolutely drove his four horses into the torrent, which was sixty or seventy yards in width, running like a mill race, and so deep that it reached nearly up to the backs of the horses. I was with him on the box. The inside passengers pulled off their coats, and prepared to swim. The water forced itself into the coach; but we reached the oppo site bank without disaster. On the preceding evening the coachman had only prevented the mail from being entirely carried away, by turn ing the horses' heads down the stream, so that the coach and horses were swimming for nearly thirty yards. I think the American coachmen, in general, are good drivers : the horses are well adapted to their work, and in fine condition : in"], [303, "7 IN AMERICA. summer they are allowed any quantity of oats they can eat, and in winter a little Indian corn is mixed with them. It is too heating to be much used in the stable during the summer months ; one feed of Indian corn is supposed to contain as much nourishment as two of oats. The coaches stop every five or six miles, and the horses drink at least half a pail of water ; they could not work without it on a hot day. The roads in the country would puzzle the most experienced English coachman ; they are often execrably bad, \u2014 and require making, not mending, \u2014 with the roots of trees sticking up in the middle of the road. The expense of finishing good roads through the forest would be enormous, far too great to be borne at present; but in the neighbourhood of the large towns I have sometimes seen them in a state of inexcusable neglect."], [304, "8 SIX MONTHS Cumberland is delightfully situated in the valley of the Potomac, surrounded by lofty hills, out-topped by the distant Alleghany, which had appeared in sight towards the close of the day. Virginia is famous for its breed of horses. Till I passed through that state I had not seen a horse with at all the shape and figure of an English hunter; but in Virginia I have seen horses on the road, and brood mares in the pas tures, displaying a great deal of blood and symmetry. In all parts of the Union which I visited, a well-bred horse is termed a \" blooded horse :\" but the Americans are quite at liberty to use what terms they please. Besides the paces usually known in England, the horse in the United States is valuable according to his per formances as a square or natural trotter, a pacer, or a racker. A racker is a beast that"], [305, "IN AMERICA. 9 can trot before, and canter behind, at the same time. The recommendations of a pacer are, that he moves his fore and hind legs on the same side at the same time, like a came leopard. When hiring a hack, you are ques tioned as to which you would prefer. As there is no fox-hunting, a fast trotter is con sidered the most valuable animal next to the racer. A horse that can trot a mile in two minutes and a half, is not thought very extra ordinary. At Cumberland I joined the high road or \" turnpike,\" between Baltimore and Pittsburgh, and soon afterwards I began the ascent of the Alleghany for the second time. The road passes over Keyser's ridge, one of the highest parts of the mountain, rising to a height of 2800 feet above the level of the western rivers. The mountain presented the same distant and inter-"], [306, "10 SIX MONTHS minable forest view that I beheld when I passed over it in Pennsylvania ; but in that state, there were more patches of cultivated land to be seen here and there in the vicinity of the high road. Silence and tranquillity to a degree I never before witnessed, are, I think, the prevailing characteristics of the American forests, where the Indian is no longer an inhabitant. They are dark, but never gloomy, excepting where they are composed of pine trees : they are solitary, and are silent as the grave, without inspiring horror. They are curious and interesting to the European traveller. In Europe the eye is fre quently attracted by the ancient relics of feudal grandeur, or the formidable structures of modern, and more civilized warfare. But the wild scenery of America is dependent for its interest on nature, and nature only ; the mountain pass is without banditti, the forest is without fastness,"], [307, "IN AMERICA. 11 and the glens and glades are quiet and legend less. I was never tired of the forest scenery, although I passed through it day after day. The endless diversity of foliage always prevents it from being monotonous. Sycamores and tulip trees of most gigantic dimensions, are to be seen on the banks of the smaller rivers, or creeks, as they are termed in the United States. With the* more stately trees of the forest are mingled the sassafras, the gum-tree, the hickory, and many others that are new to the European eye. But the most beautiful sight is afforded by the wild vine that entwines itself round the acacia, and covers every branch of it with a green tile-work, extended in festoons to the nearest trees ; like those which are to be seen in the vineyards of Italy. Soon after passing the Alleghany, I was shown the remains of an old entrenchment in a"], [308, "12 SIX MONTHS meadow on the left of the road : it was formed by Washington, then a Colonel in the British service, when pursued by the Indians after the defeat of General Braddock. A little further on, on the right hand, on the bank of a small stream, I saw the spot where the General was buried on the 9th of July, 1755; having neg lected the precautions recommended by Colonel Washington, who offered to scour the forest alongside his line of march with the provincial troops; he was attacked by the Indians in a defile on the banks of the Monongahela, when within about ten miles of Fort du Quesne, at Pittsburgh, then occupied by the French, and which he was marching to besiege : his bravery was of little use ; all the officers about his person were killed, he had five horses shot under him, and at last he himself received a mortal wound. He was conveyed away by his retreating soldiers ;"], [309, "13 IN AMERICA. but soon afterwards died, and was buried in the middle of the road, and the wagons and horses were allowed to pass over his grave, in order to conceal the spot from the pursuing Indians. With his dying breath he acknowledged to Colonel Washington the error he had committed in not following his advice. He presented him with his horse, and gave his parting injunction to an old and faithful attendant to enter into the service of Colonel Washington, and remain with him till the day of his death. Fort Du Quesne was afterwards taken by General Forbes, and the name was changed to Fort Pitt, in compli ment to the British minister. The magazine and part of the wall, are all that remain of it at present, and are to be seen near the point of confluence of the rivers at Pittsburgh. At Washington town, I attended a black Methodist meeting ; they are to be found in"], [310, "14 SIX MONTHS every considerable town in the Union, but I had never seen one before. The preacher was a half-cast, or quarteroon, as the negroes call them, and he and his congregation were all ranters ; he talked the most incoherent nonsense, and worked himself up to such a pitch of frenzy, that his appearance was almost that of a maniac. At intervals I was nearly stunned by the noise he made; and I could not help thinking of the speech of the frogs in the fable, who said to the boy as he pelted them, \" It may be very good fun for you, but we really find it exceedingly disagreeable.\" As I approached Pittsburgh the forest became less extensive, and the country exhibited a more general appearance of cultivation, although it may be broadly asserted that the Americans are at least fifty years behind us in agriculture; yet there are many gentlemen's estates on which"], [311, "15 IN AMERICA. more than ordinary care and labour have been bestowed, and which, consequently, are far in advance of others. I observed some good farm ing adjacent to the road. Some part of the country 1 am speaking of, might have been mistaken for the more wooded parts of England, had it not been for the worm or zigzag fence which is in universal use throughout the United States, and offers but a poor apology for the English hedge row, although they are sometimes composed of cedar logs. Pittsburgh is built on the confluence of the Alleghany and Monongahela rivers, both of them being about a quarter of a mile in width, whose united streams form the Ohio. They are both passed by a fine wooden bridge. The city contains 12,000 inhabitants ; but if the suburbs are included in the calculation, its population will amount to nearly 23,000. It"], [312, "16 SIX MONTHS may be called the western capital of Pennsyl vania. It manufactures annually about 18,000 tons of iron, and the same quantity of steel. It has also an extensive manufactory of cotton and glass. Bituminous coal is found in the greatest plenty in the neighbourhood, and in consequence of the smoke and black dust from the manufac tories, the shopkeepers complain that it is im possible to keep any thing clean. I entered Pittsburgh on the 4th of July, on which day, as every one knows, the Declaration of Indepen dence was signed at Philadelphia. It is, of course, always and universally a day of rejoicing in the United States. The militia are called out, a public dinner is always given in every town and village in the Union, and an appropriate oration is delivered by the appointed orator of the day. I regretted I did not arrive in time to be present at the dinner, which had taken place"], [313, "IN AMERICA. 17 under the shade of some trees on the opposite side of the Alleghany, but I heard a great number of sentiments delivered, without being drank. Any bystander wrote an idea upon a slip of paper and handed it to the orator, who read it aloud to the company. They were all more or less patriotic, but usually couched in the most ridicu lous bombastic language. The cause of reform in England, was a frequent theme of eulogy. William the reformer was applauded as being more glorious than William the Conqueror. Henry Brougham was coupled with Henry Clay, and a drunken Irishman requested \" parmission to give a woluntary toast,\" and lauded his majesty to the skies, in terms which I cannot pretend to recollect. On this day died, at New York, James Monroe, the fifth president of the United States, having: twice held that office from 1817 to 1825. VOL. II. c"], [314, "18 SIX MONTHS His eulogy was spoken by Mr. Adams, who appears to be the orator-general upon such occasions, and who, in the true spirit of repub licanism, thinks it no degradation to take his seat as a member of congress after having once filled the president's chair. Mr. Monroe was five years of age at the date of the Stamp Act. At an early age he joined the standard of Washing ton, when others were deserting it. He was present at the celebrated passage of the Dela ware at Trenton, was wounded in the sub sequent engagement, and was afterwards present in the actions of Brandywine, Germantown, and Monmouth. He took his seat in the federal congress in June 1783, at the age of twenty four. He was at first opposed to the adoption of the articles of the constitution, believing them to be imperfect, and of little remedial efficacy ; although he was decidedly in favour of"], [315, "IN AMERICA. 19 some important change in the existing govern ment under the articles of confederation. Mr. Monroe was appointed by President Washing ton, the minister plenipotentiary to the court of France, and was received with splendid formality by the national convention; but being unsuccess ful in his negociations, he was recalled, and Mr. Pinkney appointed in his place. He was afterwards appointed governor of Virginia. When Napoleon had 20,000 veterans assembled at Helvoet-sluys, ready for embarkation to Louis iana. Mr. Monroe was sent over by President Jefferson on a special commission. On his arrival, the war between Great Britain and France was rekindling, and the clanger to Louisiana was averted. In conjunction with Mr. Pinkney, the then United States' minister at Madrid, he concluded the treaty by which Louisiana was ceded to the United States, in c 2"], [316, "20 SIX MONTHS the year 1803. This state was in the possession of the Spaniards from 1762 till 1800, when it was again ceded to the French, the original settlers. The United States paid 15,000,000 of dollars for it; Mr. Monroe afterwards went to England as minister plenipotentiary, he was present in Paris at the coronation of Napoleon. He returned to the United States in 1807, and became secretary of state in 1811, and after wards secretary at war. In 1817 he was elected president, and was re-elected in 1821 without opposition. His opinion on the subject of inter nal improvements, was, that a power of establish ing a general system of internal improvement had not been delegated to congress, and he returned a bill to the house, in which it origi nated, with a justification of his exercise of prerogative, in an able and elaborate exposition of the reasons for the refusal of his assent. It"], [317, "IN AMERICA. 21 is a very singular fact, that Mr. Monroe is the third out of four deceased presidents, who have died on the 4th July. The circumstances attend ing the deaths of Presidents Jefferson and John Adams were very extraordinary. A committee of five was originally appointed to draw up the articles of the constitution. Jefferson and Adams were selected as a sub-committee, and were in fact the real framers of the constitution. These two gentlemen died on the 4th of July, in the same year, and the news of their decease arrived at exactly the same time on the same day, at Philadelphia, where the Declaration of Independence was signed. From Pittsburgh I rode to Braddock's field. It was pointed out to me about three hundred yards from the bank of the Monongahela. The ground has been considerably cleared since the action took place ; but it seems to have been"], [318, "22 SIX MONTHS admirably adapted to the Indian mode of war fare, on account of the undulating surface of the field, that enabled the Indians, with the aid of the forest with which it was then covered, to lie in ambush, and fire without being perceived. When, as a child, I used to read the account of this sanguinary conflict, as narrated by the highlander in the history of \" Sandford and Merton,\" little did I dream that I should ever stand upon the field of battle. From Pittsburg, I proceeded for fifteen miles down the western bank of the Ohio to Economy, a German settlement, under the superintendence of Mr. Rapp, conducted on a system somewhat resembling that of Mr. Owen of Lanark. The members call themselves the \" Brothers ;\" and have a community of property. Any person, of any country, however poor, may become a member, by conforming to the rules, and sub-"], [319, "23 IN AMERICA. mitting to learn one of the trades or other occupations which are taught in the society. If he be weary of its regulations, he is at liberty to leave it, and takes with him, from the public fund, all that he brought into it : his earnings, during his stay, becoming general property. It is open on the same terms, even to the entirely destitute. The town is regularly built, and extremely neat : there are 4000 acres of land belonging to the establishment, cultivated by the members, and at the expense of the society ; they have a good museum, an admirable band, and public concerts twice in the week. The \" Brothers\" are chiefly Lutherans, from Wirtenberg, where I understood they originally attempted to form a society of the same kind, but it became obnoxious to the government, and was suppressed. Mr. Rapp himself is a Lu theran clergyman, and preaches the doctrine of"], [320, "24 SIX MONTHS brotherly love. His first settlement was on the Wabash river, several hundred miles to the south ; but he sold the place to Mr. Owen, whose philanthropic exertions were, as usual, unattended with success. Mr. Rapp occasion ally goes to Philadelphia, in search of recruits amongst the latest importations from Germany ; and it will be readily believed, that he enlists none but his own countrymen to undergo this voluntary confinement, and second schooling. It is scarcely necessary to mention, that marriage and a continuance in the society, are incom patible. It is said, that Mr. Rapp's system has been sufficiently successful to cheat him into the idea, that his calling, if not of the prophetic, is, at least, of the patriarchal order. At Economy, I joined the passing steam boat for Maysville. For about a hundred and fifty miles of its course, the average width of the"], [321, "IN AMERICA. 25 Ohio is not greater than that of the Thames at Vauxhall bridge. It is often very low; and not navigable for steam-boats. The water is then extremely clear; but when I saw it, the river had been swelled by the late rains, and was very muddy. The surface of its unruffled and rapid stream was nearly covered by trunks of trees, which had been washed down by the torrents from the forests, and rendered it often necessary to stop the engine, in order to prevent accidents to the paddles. In our passage down the river we passed, amongst others, Blenner hasset's Island, so called from its having been the residence of a person of that name, who had involved himself in the supposed conspiracy of Colonel Barr, who, in 1806, fitted out an armed expedition on the Ohio, with which he intended either to make a hostile incursion into the Spanish territories, or, according to the more"], [322, "26 SIX MONTHS general belief, to make himself master of New Orleans, with a view to the formation of an independent power. Blennerhasset had beauti fied the island at a great expense, but his pro perty was confiscated by order of government. We passed Wheeling, a town containing about 6000 inhabitants, and manufactories of the same kind as those at Pittsburg. At this place, it is said, that the Baltimore and Ohio rail-road is to come in contact with the river. Maysville is a much prettier town, with a more picturesque situation; and looks well, in spite of its red houses. I ascended a hill whence I had a fine view of the Ohio, which is here above a quarter of a mile in width. It is ob servable of its banks, that they never rise to any height, directly from the water, on both sides of the river at the same time. If they are abrupt on the one side, the opposite shore is sure to"], [323, "27 IN AMERICA. display a fine strip of cultivated land intervening between the hills and the river, in the back ground. Near Portsmouth, on the Ohio, is a slip of ground containing 4000 acres, the whole of it planted with Indian corn, but it is hidden from the view of the steam-boat passengers by the trees on the margin of the river. About twenty-four miles from Maysville, on the road to Lexington, is a very fine sul phureous spring, called \" the Blue Lick.\" There are several houses in the neighbourhood for the accommodation of visiters, who resort thither for the benefit of the water. Lexington is the neatest country town I had yet seen in the United States; the streets are regular and spacious, and delightfully shaded by acacia trees, which are planted before every house : it contains about 6000 inhabitants. Al though comfortable and cheerful in its appear-"], [324, "28 six months ance, Lexington is the only place of note in the United States, whose prosperity, for several years, has been on the decline. It could boast of excellent society ; but being an inland town, and supported only by the surrounding country, it is now paying the penalty for having enlarged itself beyond its means of- supply. One addi tional cause of its decline is the great increase of steam navigation on the Ohio and Mississippi, which affords so much greater facility to travel lers going to New Orleans than the land route, which runs through Lexington. A col lege which had been established here did not answer the expectations of its founders, and a few years since was unfortunately burnt. Till lately the greatest confusion prevailed through the whole of Kentucky, in consequence of the complicated state of titles to landed property, which has considerably retarded the"], [325, "29 IN AMERICA. advance of its prosperity. Lands were sold by the government of Virginia before the separa tion of Kentucky from that state, without having been previously surveyed and marked out. The consequence was, that four or five different per sons entered with their warrants of possession, as purchasers of the same lots, where, in many cases, their interest had already been sold and re-sold. The endless litigation occasioned by this state of affairs produced a law, limiting the time of action to seven years, after which the occupier was to remain in undisputed possession of the property. The system of country banks has been still more ruinous to Lexington, and the state of Kentucky generally. They were first established towards the end of the year 1817. The persons principally connected with them were members of the legislature ; about forty of them were opened"], [326, "30 six months with, of course, a very limited capital, but an unlimited supply of paper. The establishment of the branch bank of the United States obliged them to pay in specie, and the consequence was the greatest embarrassment in their affairs. The directors enacted what laws they pleased, to save themselves from the impending ruin : they abolished imprisonment for debt, and passed what were called stay laws, \u2014 general and parti cular enactments, which extended the time of payment; a desperate mode of proceeding, and which only served to plunge them deeper in the mire. Those who were of opinion that pay ment of debts, contracted at a time when paper was the only currency, could not now be demanded in specie, contrived to get a law passed establishing a new court, filled by judges whose opinions coincided with their own, and who were removable at pleasure. The deci-"], [327, "IN AMERICA. 31 sions of this court were at variance with those of the old one, and a new and old court party immediately arose. The judges of the new court, however, immediately resigned. Public and private credit is still at a low ebb, and the ultimate ruin of many of the leading families in the state, who are connected with the banks, appears, I was informed, almost unavoidable. A rail-road to Louisville is shortly to be commenced, which will, no doubt, much be nefit the town and surrounding country. At the distance of a mile stands the English-looking residence of Henry Clay, Esq., whose public services are too well known to need any remark here. I visited several caves in this neighbour hood; that called Russell's cave, distant about six miles, is most worthy of attention. It is three quarters of a mile in length, formed in a"], [328, "32 SIX MONTHS rock, composed of innumerable strata of marine shells, embedded in lime-stone. The action of water, occasioning an immense pressure, is evi dent at first sight. A delicious spring issues from the cave, which unfortunately was so swollen as to prevent my entrance. Three miles hence, I observed two Indian forts. The larger is surrounded by a trench, which is now about seven feet deep and three quarters of an inch in length. In the swollen one the ditch is considerably deeper and more distinct, en circling it on every side, excepting where aji entrance, wide enough to admit a carriage, has been left untouched by the spade. At Lexington, I was much amused at the master-aping manners of the slaves. They give themselves great airs. On Sundays they either hire hacks, or more commonly ride their mas ters' horses. I saw dozens of them, attended by"], [329, "33 IN AMERICA. their females, playing the agreeable on horse back, and \"doing a bit of park\" \"a la mili taire.\" The slaves of the southern states are a very happy race. In some places their numbers constitute a \" plaie politique,\" equally trouble some, and far more formidable, than the system of poor laws in England. In many places they far outnumber the whites, who are obliged to use great precautions, and restrict their slaves in many particulars. About twenty years ago a conspiracy was formed by the negroes at Lexington : a house was to be set on fire, and whilst every one repaired to the spot, they were to take possession of a large stand of arms kept at the inn, and the defenceless crowd were to be fired upon. The bank was to be plundered, and the town burnt. The conspiracy was dis covered by a negress, who, on the preceding evening, told her master that the leaders were VOL.

There are still such animals in existence as slave merchants, but they are not numerous. Slaves are purchased in different parts of the country, and sent clown the Mississippi to the sugar plantations at New Orleans. An able bodied young negro is worth three hundred dollars, and the merchant is encouraged in his brutal traffic by a sure market, and a profit of at least thirty-five, and frequently of forty or forty-five per cent., after deducting the neces sary expenses for food and clothing, and making allowances for losses by death and accident. Three or four years back, one of these men and his assistants were murdered on the Mississippi by a cargo of slaves, who spared no torture"], [331, "35 IN AMERICA. that could be applied by means of fire aud steel. In Virginia, if a black is freed by his master he is presented as a nuisance by the grand jury, and generally is not allowed to remain in the state. In Kentucky, a freed man cannot leave his native county without quitting the state entirely ; and a master who emancipates his slave, is obliged to give security to the county for his maintenance. Even a white man, who would be called a vagrant in England, is there liable, not only to be taken up but to be sold, for two or three months, to the highest bidder, who has the power of treating him as a slave, if he refuse to work. When any ship arrives at Charleston in South Carolina, the police im mediately go on board, and have the power of arresting the black cook, or any free negro they find there, who is placed in confinement till the d2"], [332, "36 SIX MONTHS ship is ready to put to sea again. So jealous are they of the presence of a free negro, that a master is not permitted to emancipate his slave without sending him out of the state ; and if a slave has left South Carolina, in the capacity of valet with his master, and has once obtained his liberty, by setting foot in a free state, he is never allowed to return. At Washington, the sound of the slave auctioneer's hammer may be heard within a short distance of the capitol. In Virginia, the country of Hampden-Sydney College, the slave population amounted, in 1830, to 469,724, being larger than that of any other state, and bearing a proportion to the whites of rather less than four to six. In Georgia there is a county, most appropriately called Liberty County, where the slave population is to the whites as five to one. The slave children are not instructed to read"], [333, "37 IN AMERICA. or write at the expense of their masters ; if they enjoy these advantages, they have been taught by persons of their own colour. If they could write, they would forge their pass-papers, and run away; and those who can, are always ready to do this for those who cannot. The slave population could not be educated, and remain long in a state of bondage. Its march of intellect would be stronger and more terrible than the fire in the vast American forests which it would tra verse : to check it is impossible, and flight is unavailing ; so that the only means of avoiding destruction is to add vigour, and give direction to the flame.

The apparent advantage of procuring labour"], [334, "38 six months for nothing is often far outweighed by the consequences arising from the idle and care less manners of the slaves, and the expense incurred in their maintenance. Two white men will easily perform the work of three negroes, when the weather is not intolerably hot. They do as little as they can for their masters; but on a holiday they will work for each other like real slaves. Even an unaccus tomed eye would recognize a slave district by the slovenly appearance of the farms, and of every thing connected with them. The resi dence of the slaves is usually at some little distance from the dwelling-house of their master. The quarter, as it is termed, consists of a num ber of small huts, with a larger house for the overseer, and will sometimes contain three hun dred or four hundred negroes, with their fami lies, and all more or less distantly related to"], [335, "IN AMERICA. 39 each other. An arable farm will scarcely pay, unless its superintendent be a man of skill, firm ness, and perseverance. So much depends upon him, that if he be a person of that character, a good farm, one year with another, will return a profit of eight or ten per cent. ; but it is usually not so large, and is never equal to the emo lument of an attentive agriculturist in the northern states, where slaves are unknown. By the last census, the total population of the United States was 12,856,165: of these 2,010,436 were slaves, existing only in what are termed the southern states, of which Mary land is the most northerly. It is said, that supposing an inclination to secede from the Union should be prevalent in the southern states, the danger they would incur from their inability to defend themselves against their black population, would be a sufficient reason for their"], [336, "40 SIX MONTHS thinking twice on the subject. There can be no doubt, that the slaves, with an offer of liberty, would prove a most formidable weapon in the hands of an enemy. This, however, is not very likely to take place, at least not as yet. Before I quitted America a partial insurrec tion had taken place in Virginia, in which sixty or seventy persons were brutally massacred by the negroes ; and it is most probable that the state legislature will consider of some measures by which the superabundant slave population may be effectually disposed of. Their attention will probably be directed to the colony of Liberia, on the windward coast in Africa, hitherto supported exclusively by the funds and management of the colonization society, which provides vessels for the transportation of slaves manumitted on con dition of their departure for that place. Within the last few years two or three hundred negroes"], [337, "IN AMERICA. 41 have been annually sent out of the country in this manner. The capital of the colony, which is defended by a garrison, is called Monravia, be cause it was founded during the presidency of Mr. Monroe. The blacks support themselves by traffic with the natives, and by cultivating the soil. I really think I had not seen more than one or two ponds in the LTnited States, before I entered the state of Kentucky ; there, they are common enough, and plenty of bull-frogs may usually be heard grunting in the mud on their margins. With the aid of a little fancy, there is certainly some truth in the assertion, that the noise they make resembles the words \" blood and 'ounds, \" repeated in a very deep and coarse human voice. I confess that I had formed an erroneous"], [338, "42 SIX MONTHS idea of Kentucky, at least, of that part of it through which I passed. Contrary to my ex pectations, I found the land as much cleared as in any state I had previously seen. The soil is very rich in many parts ; and will produce five or six crops of Indian corn or wheat, in successive years, without the assistance of manure. It is a positive fact, that the grazing farmers will not unfrequently pull down and remove the sheds in the fields, sooner than incur the trouble and expense of clearing away the quantity of manure that has accumulated in them. Labour is dear, and land is cheap ; so that a farmer who can clear good fresh land whenever he pleases, has no inducement to be at the expense which is neces sarily laid out on a farm in England, before it is rendered sufficiently productive. The dressing of land, by laying on manure or otherwise improving it, would, iii Kentucky, be considered"], [339, "43 IN AMERICA. generally, a waste of labour. Hemp is the staple article of produce in this state. The finest specimens of American forest scenery are to be found in Kentucky : the oaks and sycamores, in particular, grow to an immense size, and throw a delicious shade on the soil beneath; which is often free from all kinds of underwood, and covered with a carpet of green sward, \u2014 affording the finest pasture ground imaginable to great numbers of cattle, which are constantly grazing there. I was forcibly reminded of the beautiful description in the opening scene of \" Ivanhoe.\" I had resolved to visit the great Mammoth cave in Kentucky, distant about 120 miles from Lexington, on the right of the Nashville road. I accordingly proceeded in that direction, and soon arrived on the banks of the Kentucky river. I considered this ferry as a most beautiful speci-"], [340, "44 SIX MONTHS men of Indian scenery. The river is here seventy or eighty yards across, and flows with a dark and quiet stream, between two very high cliffs, whose bold, bare, limestone fronts are seen to great advantage, as they rise above the mass of forest, that intervenes between their base and the water. It bore some resemblance to Swinsund ferry, on the frontier of Sweden and Norway, although certainly inferior. Shaker's town is occupied as the name im plies, by persons of that sect. One of their number, which amoimts to a few hundreds, is an architect, and this accounts for the superior build of their houses. From Glasgow, a cross road conducted me to Bell's tavern, a solitary house standing at the meeting of the Lexington and Louisville roads, to Nashville, in the midst of what are called \" the barrens.\" These barrens, it is supposed by many, were originally"], [341, "45 IN AMERICA. Prairies, or \" Pararas,\" as they are called by the lower class of Americans, but are now prin cipally covered by dwarf oaks. Wild turkeys, deer, pheasants, and the bird called the barren hen, which is also the prairie hen, and the grouse of the northern and middle states, are found in the barrens; congars, wolves, foxes, &c. are also to be met with there. At Bell's tavern, which, by the way, is a very comfortable little country inn, I procured horses and a guide, and set out for the Mammoth cave. After an agreeable and shady ride of seven miles, I arrived at a small lonely log house tavern, built about a hundred yards from the mouth of the great cave. . There are several smaller caves in the neighbourhood ; but the only one of these I visited was the white cave ; of no extent, but curious, on account of the number, and diver sified shape of its stalactitic formations, formed"], [342, "46 SIX MONTHS by the depositions of water, dropping through the limestone rock. Immediately in front of the inn, begins a narrow path winding down a dark ravine, which conducts to the cave. Its entrance is over shadowed by the dark foliage of the surrounding trees, and its appearance altogether is exceed ingly gloomy, and calculated to inspire a feeling of horror. The presence of two beautiful humm ing birds very much heightened by contrast the effects of the scene. They were darting in all directions, as quickly as the eye could follow; sometimes passing with the greatest rapidity across the mouth of the cave, or remaining for an instant, motionless in the air, as they sipped, on the wing, of the water that was incessantly dripping from the projecting rock. I could not but think of the incantation scene in \"Der Freychiitze.\""], [343, "IN AMERICA. 47 The very sudden encounter of cold air at the mouth of the cave, is more agreeable than safe during the hot weather. Not that the air itself is damp or unwholesome ; on the con trary, it is particularly dry and healthy. I have been told of its acting as a febrifuge, and can easily believe it. A great quantity of salt petre was made there during the late war. The works still remain, but have not been used for many years. The salt was procured by pouring water over a wooden trough, filled with the earth from the cave, which, when saturated, was allowed to run off; was then boiled, and the salt separated by vaporization. By this process, two pounds of salt-petre were procured from one bushel of earth. The air is so highly impregnated with the saline particles, that meat, butter, cheese, and many other substances, after remaining a short time in the cave, become of a bright red"], [344, "48 SIX MONTHS colour, and are unfit for use. I was attended by an old man, and two boys, sons of the landlord, each of us carrying a small lamp, with an ad ditional supply of grease to trim them. The rock is very low near the entrance, but soon expands to a magnificent size. The average width and height may be about seventy feet, but in some places it is more lofty, and far wider. I first visited an antehamber, and walked a mile before I reached the end, where there is a small but curious waterfall, that has worked its way into the side of the rock in a serpentine direc tion. Sulphur, red and yellow ochre, may be picked up there ; and gum borax, sulphate of magnesia, and sulphate of soda, are found adher ing to the walls in considerable quantities, but not in every part. We returned from the ante chamber and proceeded up the principal part of the cave. The roof and sides were but little"], [345, "49 IN AMERICA. broken, and in general their evenness and regu larity of angle were surprising. The walking was very good at first ; but our passage was soon impeded and rendered fatiguing, by the enor mous number of loose blocks of lhnestone, that were heaped up on every side. At intervals we came to a small pyramid composed of broken fragments, raised by the aborigines, who have left traces of their existence throughout the whole of North America. I pulled down one of them, and found only the remains of a fire ; similar marks are to be seen on the bare rock in many parts of the cave. Pieces of cane with which Kentucky originally abounded, within the memory of many now living, were strewed around, having evidently afforded the fuel with which these fires were fed. In some places the face of the rock had been slightly worked, but for what purpose will for ever remain undeter- VOL. II. E"], [346, "50 SIX MONTHS mined. The floor of the cave is generally parallel with the surface of the ground above, as no great rise or fall is perceivable throughout its entire direction. At about the distance of a mile and a half from its mouth, the cave takes a majestic bend to the left, and two miles fur ther we arrived at what is called \" the cross roads.\" From this large and gloomy expanse, four distinct caverns branch out in different directions. The glare of our lamps was just sufficiently powerful to display the opening on the left. It looked as black and dismal as darkness could make it, and was formed by vast fragments of rock, thrown together with a confusion equalling that at the pass in the Py renees, usually known by the name of Chaos. We clambered over them, and after half an hour's walking, we arrived at what seemed to be the termination of the cavern; but, in the"], [347, "51 IN AMERICA. corner on the left, is a kind of natural chimney, through which we climbed to another chamber. It did not much differ from the other parts of the cave, excepting that it is much wider in proportion to its length, and the roof blacker. A solitary bat was clinging to it, and was the only living animal I saw in the cave. No others inhabit this mansion of utter darkness. The small pyramids of stone, and the marks of fire, were very numerous. We explored the other branches of the cave in succession. At intervals the huge blocks of limestone rose nearly to the roof, and seemed to set progress at defiance; but, after mastering the summit, we were enabled to continue, till we reached another and similar difficulty. The cave never appeared to such effect as when seen from the top of one of these eminences ; because its downward dimensions were not visible by the light of the lamps, and e 2"], [348, "52 SIX MONTHS. a bottomless pit was an easy conjecture. The most terrific place is what is called the cataracts; here, the floor sinks away to a greater depth, and a large chasm is formed on one side by gigantic mis-shapen rocks, fearfully disposed over the head of the explorer, as he gladly descends to refresh himself with a draught of the pure, delicious water, that falls from the roof. I thought I had never before seen any thing so unearthly, excepting perhaps, the crater of Vesuvius. We subsequently entered a smaller part of the cave, which is gradually contracted into so narrow a passage, that we were obliged to crawl on all fours. It led us, in a few minutes, to the brink of a large black pit, down which I tossed some fragments of stone, and we heard them descending from rock to rock, for the depth, I should judge, of 150 feet. In this manner I visited three, and I have"], [349, "IN AMERICA. 53 reason to believe, all the four extremities, of the principal branches of the cave. I had been told that it was as much as twelve miles to the end of the cavern which I entered through the chim ney, and that the cave itself had been explored for more than fourteen. The guides make it out to be more than double its real length. I was more than six hours under ground, and moving almost incessantly, during which time, as nearly as I could calculate, I walked but nine or ten miles. The extreme ends of the principal branches, I should say, were between four and five. There are several smaller cham bers, which I did not visit, but I heard that they contained nothing new, or different from the others ; and feeling greatly fatigued, was glad to emerge into the open air. I found it requisite to pause at the entrance : there is no intermediate temperature between the cool,"], [350, "54 SIX MONTHS but not chilly air of the cave, and the sultry atmosphere of noon. The sensation was extra ordinary ; with both my arms extended, one hand would be warm, at the same time that I would gladly withdraw the other from the contact of the colder air of the cave. Those who do not take the precaution of waiting a few minutes, are almost invariably attacked with giddiness, or a fainting fit. I had erred in believing that the huge bones of the mammoth and other quadrupeds at pre sent unknown, had been found in this cave ; and in imagination I had listened to the dying cries of agony sent forth by those stupendous animals as they struggled in the thundering billow of the deluge that had risen, and rolled into their hiding place, and reduced them to a state of frenzy and desperation. But it has received its name of the \" mammoth cave\""], [351, "55 IN AMERICA. only on account of its superior size and extent : the term being frequently applied where size or importance is intended to be designated. For instance, the branch bank of the United States at Cincinnati, is called the Mammoth bank. None but human bones have been found in this cave. These were often dug up by the saltpetre manufacturers, and were usually found lying side by side, but separated and covered over by a rough slab of limestone. I was informed that upwards of a hundred ske letons had been there unearthed ; and it is probable that more are still remaining in dif ferent parts of the cave. In general they are not larger than those of the ordinary race of men. They are doubtless the remains of some of that ancient nation, whose very name is unknown ; whose customs and occupation are unrecorded ; whose chiefs and heroes remain"], [352, "56 SIX MONTHS unchronicled, and whose existence is to be traced only in the monuments of death or warfare. The manner in which this and the other caves in Kentucky have been formed may, perhaps, be more than conjectured. They are all composed of secondary limestone, resting on a substratum of sand, \u2014 a singular formation, but one that is common in this part of Ame rica. The sand may have been gradually dis lodged by the action of water; a theory which the sloping nature of the ground between the cave and the Green river, only a few hundred yards distant, does not contradict. A gentle man informed me that he had lately witnessed a similar process. He had for a long time watched the increase of a small sand bank, that had been forming in a stream on his own pro perty in the lower part of Kentucky, \u2014 and upon further examination he found, as he ex-"], [353, "57 IN AMERICA. pected, that a cave had been gradually hol lowed out by the action of the water behind it. The whole of this country and the region watered by the Mississippi, is diluvial, and in many places marine shells and the fossil re mains of marine animals have been found in great abundance. In the neighbourhood of the cave, there are a great many wild turkeys, and a tolerable sprinkling of deer, but both were difficult of approach at that season of the year. I was exceedingly anxious for a shot at a wild turkey, but committed a great error in loading with ball only; and although I contrived to get three or four fair shots on the ground, and on the wing, yet I confess through eagerness to have missed them. Once I contrived to near a brood, but had the mortification, although close to them, to hear them rising one by one on the other side of"], [354, "58 six MONTHS a thicket ; and when I did pull at the last bird, my gun, which was loaded with shot, missed fire through the badness of the copper cap. After vainly toiling through the forest in search of a deer, for one whole August day, I was poacher enough to drop clown the Green river in a canoe, in the vicinity of the cave, at two in the morn ing, in order to get a shot at one whilst feeding upon the moss at the bottom of the river. A light was placed at the head of the boat with a board behind it. I sat in the middle of the canoe, which was paddled forward by a man at the stern ; both of us being as silent as possible. The darker the night, the better; the deer stand gazing at the light, till the canoe almost touches them ; they appear as white as a sheep, and the aim of a Kentucky rifle is usually too true, at any reasonable distance, to render the death of one of them an uncertainty."], [355, "59 IN AMERICA. But I was again unfortunate. I had been dis appointed in the attendance of an experienced hunter, whom I had engaged to go with me, and my companion, who was a novice, allowed three deer that were standing close to us, but not distinguishable by me among the tall sedge, to run off untouched by the random shot I sent after them. The back-woodsmen are excellent marksmen, their rifles are long and heavy, carry ing a very small ball, often not bigger than a large pea. With these a good shot will alter nately hit and miss the head of a squirrel at sixty yards distance. I returned to Bell's tavern with the deter mination of advising every travelling friend who visited Kentucky, by no means to leave that state without having seen the Mammoth cave; and I think that a sportsman, well pro vided with dogs, guns, &c, might well spend"], [356, "60 SIX MONTHS a week in a very satisfactory manner by taking up his quarters at Bell's tavern. When we had forded the Green river, the coachman addressed a man on the opposite side, and asked him how his wife was, \" Thank 'e, I guess, she 's smartly unwell this morning,\" was the reply. Louisville is about ninety miles from the cave. For the last twenty, the road runs along the banks of the Ohio, passing through the most magnificent forest of beech trees I had ever beheld. There is nothing remarkable in the appearance of Louisville. It is a large and regularly built town, containing 11,000 inhabitants. From this place the larger steam boats start for New Orleans. Those that come from Pittsburgh are of smaller dimensions, on account of the shallowness of the water. The course of the Ohio, from Pittsburgh to Louis ville is about 600 miles, and thence, to its"], [357, "61 IN AMERICA. confluence with the Mississippi, is nearly 300 more. The length of the Mississippi, from its junction with the Ohio, is 1200. The falls, or rapids of the Ohio, are immediately below Louisville, and part of them may be seen from the town. I had been very desirous of seeing St. Louis and the Missouri; but the season was too far advanced, and that part of the country is ex ceedingly unhealthy during the summer heats. Steam-boats run thither constantly, in three days, from Louisville. There is also a land conveyance, which occupies nearly the same time on the journey, and passes through the great Prairies, in Indiana and Illinois. Wild turkeys are there very plentiful ; quails and Prairie-hens ars frequently to be seen from the road in great abundance ; and I would strongly recommend any traveller who is fond of shoot-"], [358, "62 SIX MONTHS ing, and who will put up with very indifferent accommodation, to proceed for about one hun dred miles, or even less, by this road, into the Prairies, for the purpose of shooting. It must, however, be added, that he will probably kill much more than he can either eat or carry away. That there is a great quantity of game in some parts of America is indisputable ; but it is equally so, that it is fast decreasing in others. Unless some attention be paid to preserving, deer will become extremely scarce, except in the unsettled country; and the breed of wild turkeys will be extinct, as they are not found much to the west of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. Go where you will, you are told there is plenty of game of some kind ; but the sports man who relies on this information at this season of the year, while the trees are yet thick with foliage, will be surely disappointed. I"], [359, "63 IN AMERICA. have occasionally stayed for a day at different places, where I had been induced to believe that I should find some sport; but I seldom found any game, although I always took with me some person well acquainted with the woods. The want of dogs must certainly be taken into consideration. The inhabitants of Kentucky may be called the Gascjons of America. They have a hu morous, good-natured, boasting, boisterous pecu liarity of language and manner, by which they are known in all parts of the Union. To a stranger, they are courteous and hospitable ; but amongst themselves, they quarrel and fight, like the Irish, for fun ; or merely to see which is the best man, without any provocation ; and they evince great partiality for their own state \u2014 which they familiarly denominate \" Old Ken tuck,\" \u2014 perhaps more than the inhabitants of any other in the LTnion."], [360, "64 SIX MONTHS Kentucky was originally used by the Indians as a hunting-field, and for no other purpose. The neighbouring nations agreed never to build upon it. From Louisville, I proceeded in a steam boat to Cincinnati, in eighteen hours. About forty miles on this side of the town, we passed the mouth of the stream, so well known by the name of the \" Big Bone Lick, \" on account of the number of the bones of the mammoth and other animals that have been frequently dug up in its vicinity. There is a sulphur-spring, and a house for the accommodation of visitors. Our distinguished countryman, Mr. Bullock, whom I saw at Cincinnati, had been lately residing on the spot for three months, and had had twenty men constantly employed in digging. He had discovered, amongst other animals, the bones of a smaller and distincts pecies of migalonyx;"], [361, "IN AMERICA. 65 an animal having partly the generic character of the armadillo, and partly that of the sloth, and nearly equalling the rhinoceros in size. But 4 the most remarkable remains were those of a young colt, and a gigantic horse, that could not have been less than twenty-four hands high. Unfortunately, however, for the advancement of science, they were all destroyed by a fire, which took place about three weeks before my arrival. The fossil remains of about thirty animals, now supposed to be extinct, have been found at the Big Bone Lick ; and Mr. Bullock conjectures that there are no more remaining. That the animals did not perish on the spot, but were carried and deposited by the mighty torrent, which it is evident once swept over the face of the country, is probable, from the circumstance of marine shells, plants, and fossil substances having been found, not only mixed with the bones, but VOL. II. F"], [362, "66 SIX MONTHS adhering to them, and tightly wedged into the cavities of the skulls \u2014 \" those holes where eyes did once inhabit,\" were often stopped up by shells or pieces of coral, forcibly crammed into them. From the Big Bone to the Blue Lick, a distance of about sixty miles, there is a buffalo path. Those animals existed in great numbers in this part of the country, within the memory of many individuals now living. They passed from one favourite spring to the other in vast herds, always pursuing the same path, seldom turning to the right or left, and overturning very young trees, or any slight obstacle that might occur in their line of march. They have, however, long been killed off from the eastern side of the Ohio, and Mississippi; not being seen nearer than within fifty miles of St. Louis. They are found in innumerable herds in the widely extended plains of the Missouri, and"], [363, "IN AMERICA. 67 towards the region of the rocky mountains. The Indians kill a great many of them, for the sake of their skins, which sell in Philadelphia at four dollars a piece, while that of a bear may be purchased for three. They are so numerous, that this traffic occasions no perceptible differ ence in the size of the herds. An Indian will drive an arrow so hard that the point will appear on the other side of the buffalo. At certain seasons of the year, their tramping and bellow ing may be heard at a vast distance on the plains, by putting the ear to the ground ; and in this way, if heard in the morning, incredible as it may appear, it will sometimes be evening before the hunters can come up with them. The bonassus, exhibited some years ago in London, was merely the common American buffalo; which is, strictly speaking, the bison, or animal with the hump, and not the buffalo. f2"], [364, "68 SIX MONTHS The bison is found of different sizes and under different names in Africa, in Asia, in the island of Madagascar, and on the Malabar coast; and exists, as we have seen, in immense numbers in North America ; and it will associate with, and breed with tame cattle : but the real buffalo, which has no hump on the shoulder, is not found in the New Continent, but is common in India, and in Africa, near the Cape. I have also seen them in the Pontine marshes, where they are used for agricultural purposes. A marked dif ference between the buffalo and the bison, from the different varieties of which, it is supposed, that our domestic animals have descended, is to be observed in the fact of the tame cattle re fusing to breed with the buffalo, and in the period of gestation in that animal being extended to a whole year. The navigation of the Ohio and the Missis-"], [365, "IN AMERICA. 69 sippi, is often rendered dangerous by the trunks of trees, or snags, as they are called, which, in floating down the stream, get entangled and stick fast in the mud at the bottom ; presenting a most formidable, and frequently unseen point near the surface of the water. Our steamer ran upon one of them, but was soon got off again by means of a long spar of wood that was dropped into the water, and then used as a lever, with the side of the boat for a fulcrum, by means of a rope wound about the capstan and fastened to the top of the spar. In the midst of the con fusion, an American stepped up to me, and said, \" Stranger, I guess we're in a bad fix !\" To be in a good or a bad fix is an expression very commonly made use of in cases of dilemma. Speaking of a man placed in the stocks, for instance, a common American would remark, that he was in a \"bad fix,\" without the least"], [366, "70 SIX MONTHS fear of committing a pun, even at Philadelphia, where the disease is very prevalent. The Ame rican error is detected in the formal and decided accentuation of particular syllables in several common words, and in the laughable misuse of many others ; and not in any mispronunciation of the language, generally. The word Engine, for instance, is pronounced Engine ; favourite, favourite ; European, European, &c. A patois, or provincial dialect, such as is heard in the more distant counties in England, is unknown amongst the natives of the United States ; and the similarity of language to be heard in every part of the Union that I visited, could not but attract my attention as an Englishman. To travel by the mail, for two or three hundred miles, and to sit beside a coachman who spoke as good English as the one with whom I first started, had certainly, at least I thought so, the effect of shortening the distance."], [367, "71 IN AMERICA. The education of the poorer classes is very much attended to, excepting perhaps, in the more western states, where the inhabitants think they can get on just as well without it. In the Atlantic states, there is not one person in five hundred (I am speaking of native Ameri cans), that cannot read and write. The mail would often stop opposite a solitary log-house, in the midst of the thickest forest, and throw down a newspaper, which was immediately picked up, and spelled over with the greatest avidity. Most of the back-woodsmen can talk with all reasonable correctness of the state of Europe generally, but the reform bills in Eng land, and the Liverpool rail-road, were always amongst the most prominent subjects of eager inquiry. An Englishman cannot travel a mile in a stage coach in the United States, without being asked whether he has been on the Liver-"], [368, "72 SIX MONTHS pool rail-road. In Europe, and in France particularly, it is, \" Have you seen de tunnel under de Thames ?\" It is the usefulness in forwarding the prosperity of a country that sug gests the American query: whilst with the Frenchman, the use is entirely out of the ques tion ; he thinks merely of the magnitude and the novelty of the undertaking, and never fails to remark, that the engineer was a native of France. A great proportion of the inhabitants of the eastern states are Dutch and German. They are very numerous in different parts of Pennsylvania, where they have the character of being good and industrious farmers ; but in other respects, they are very ignorant and opinionated, refusing the education that is offered to them gratis for their children, who are, of course, far behind the young Americans in intelligence. I have often, when passing through the forest,"], [369, "73 IN AMERICA. stopped to ask a cottager's child of what country he was. A very frequent answer was, \" Please, sir, father 's an Irishman, and mother 's Dutch ; \" and \" I was raised here ! \" The latter expres sion is very commonly used when the place of nativity is inquired after. I have been fre quently addressed with, Where were you raised, stranger ? I guess you 're from the old country ? There are about half-a-dozen words in constant use, to which an English ear is unaccustomed, in the sense they are meant to convey, such as \u2014 \" to fix, to locate, to guess, to expect, to calkilate, &c.\" The verb \" to fix,\" has perhaps as many significations as any word in the Chinese lan guage. If anything is to be done, made, mixed, mended, bespoken, hired, ordered, arranged, procured, finished, lent, or given, it would very probably be designated by the verb \"to fix.\" The tailor or bootmaker who is receiving your"], [370, "74 SIX MONTHS instructions, the barkeeper who is concocting for you a glass of mint-julep, promise alike to fix you, that is, to hit your taste exactly. A lady's hair is sometimes said to be fixed, instead of dressed; and were I to give my coat or my boots to a servant to be brushed, and to tell him merely \"to fix\" them for me, he would perfectly understand what he had to do. There is a marked peculiarity in the word \" clever. \" In America, a man or woman may be very clever without possessing one grain of talent. The epithet is applied almost exclu sively to a person of an amiable and obliging disposition. Mr. A. is a man of no talent ! no ! but then he is a very clever man ! According to their meaning, Buonaparte was terribly stupid, and Lord North was a very clever fellow indeed. To say nothing of their oaths, their ex pressions are sometimes highly amusing. I"], [371, "75 IN AMERICA. have heard a horse described as a \" raal smasher at trotting,\" and a highway robbery considered as a \" pretty middling tough piece of busi ness ; \" with a vast number more of the same kind. I beg it may be understood, that I mean these remarks to apply chiefly to the middle and lower classes of Americans : the language of every one is perfectly intelligible, and as I have before remarked, there is no patois : I think it should rather be called a \"slang.\" There is also much less of the nasal twang than I had been taught to expect in American parley. Still I was informed, that many Americans when they hear a man talk, will instantly mention with certainty the coun try in which he has been long resident, being able to detect some words, accents, or expres sions peculiar to each state. The English language does not contain words enough for"], [372, "76 SIX MONTHS them. The word congressional is a fair coin age from \" Congress,\" like the word par liamentary from parliament. But a member of congress is said to be deputized ; and a per son in danger, to be jeopardized. I remember that about two years ago being in the Jardin des Plantes, I was nearly \" cameleopardized\" by the giraffe that kicked at me. In New York I observed that a gunmaker had put up over his door, \" Flint and steel guns altered and per cussionized.\" Although the meaning of all this is perfectly understood, still it is American, not English ; and although the English language be in use, yet the very un-English construction and distorted meaning of many sentences, ren der it so different from the language spoken in good society in England, that I do not think it can safely be dignified with the name of good English. But the English spoken in"], [373, "IN AMERICA. 77 the first circles in all the larger cities of the Union, is usually very good : so that between the language of the English and the American gentleman, the difference is exceedingly slight ; but still there is a difference here and there, by which I think any person of observation, who had been in the United States, could decide upon the country of the speaker, unless of course he had resided in England. I should however add, that I have in a few instances met with gentlemen whose language and pro nunciation would have deceived any one. At Baltimore whilst taking a sketch, I told a drunken ill-favoured old nigger, that I would take his picture. He accordingly placed him self in attitude, and I soon hit him off with the camera-lucida. He was very much pleased, and showed the picture to his coloured friends, the slaves, who were- working near me. He"], [374, "78 SIX MONTHS soon returned with an old black as ugly as himself, and said, that this man wished to have his \" title \" taken too. We arrived at Cincinnati, the emporium of commerce, and the largest city in Western America, containing 30,000 inhabitants, and thirty different places of worship. In appear ance it differs from most of the larger towns in the United States, on account of the great improvement that has taken place in the colour of the houses, which, instead of being of the usual bright staring red, are frequently of a white grey, or a yellowish tint, and display a great deal of taste, and just ornament. The public buildings are not large, but very neat and classical; I admired the second Presby terian church, which is a very pretty specimen of the Doric. The streets are handsome, and the shops have a very fashionable air. The"], [375, "IN AMERICA. 79 principal trade of Cincinnati is in provisions. Immense quantities of corn and grain are sent clown the Ohio and the Mississippi to New Orleans. Part of it is consumed by the sugar planters, who are supposed to grow no corn, and part is sent coastwise to Mobile, or exported to the Havannah and the West Indies generally. In the United States, the word \" corn\" is ap plied exclusively to the Indian corn or maize, other grain is specified by name as in England. The quantity of flour received in 1831 at New Orleans, amounted to 370,000 barrels, about 150,000 barrels more than had been received in any former year. A great quantity of flour had also been shipped to England, but it is very often soured by the warmth of the water in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1828, the quantity of sugar produced at New Orleans was 88,878 hogsheads of 1000 pounds each, and in 1827,"], [376, "80 SIX MONTHS the number of sugar plantations was seven hundred, in which an aggregate capital of 45,000,000 of dollars was invested. Cincinnati has displayed more wisdom than her opposite neighbour in Kentucky. A specu lative system of banking was carried on about the same time, and was attended with the same results as those I have before noticed when speaking of that state. Credit was not to be obtained, commerce was at an end, and grass was growing in the streets of Cincinnati. But the judicature, with equal justice and determina tion, immediately enforced by its decisions the resumption of cash payments. Many of the leading families in the place were, of course, ruined, and at present there are not above five or six persons in Cincinnati, who have been able to regain their former eminence as men of business. But it was a sacrifice of individuals"], [377, "81 IN AMERICA. for the good of the community, and fortune only deserted the speculators in order to attend upon the capitalists, who quickly made their appear ance from the eastern states, and have raised the city to its present pitch of prosperity. Cincinnati professes to have two excellent inns, both of which give promise of every com fort : the table was very good, but my rest was destroyed, not merely disturbed, by the worst of vermin. A clean bed, be it but of straw, is a sine qua non with an English traveller; and as I did not feel perfectly well after breathing the unhealthy fogs of the Ohio, I had consoled myself with the idea of a comfortable sleep for that night at least. But I was wofully dis appointed, being nearly in a fever ; and when I was permitted to close my eyes for a few minutes, I dreamed of the most unconnected VOL. II. G"], [378, "82 SIX MONTHS subjects, \u2014 bullfrogs, and universal suffrage, for instance. I started by the mail, in order to cross the country to Lake Erie. Before we were out of the town, the near leader became unmanageable, and the coach was overturned in the open street. I was on the box, and expected to be kicked to pieces, as I fell close to the horses ; but pro videntially they all four galloped off with the two front wheels, and no one was hurt. It was scarcely day-light \u2014 no one was up \u2014 the coach man went after the horses, and it fell to my lot to deliver the coach of her nine inside passengers, who scrambled out one by one through the window, guessing and ' calkilating ' the whole time. By the evening, we had reached the Yellow Springs; a fashionable watering place, taking its name from the colour imparted to the rocks"], [379, "IN AMERICA. 83 by the water, which is chalybeate. A large boarding house for the accommodation of visi tors is the only building of consequence in the neighbourhood. At Centreville, about twenty miles from the springs, is, or rather was, for it has been partly destroyed, a remarkably fine Indian fort ; being a deep ditch lying between two raised banks, and inclosing a space of three quarters of a mile in circumference, on which the town is built. On the outside is a large mound, which had been lately opened, and was found to contain a number of human bones. At a distance of nine miles from the springs, on the Sandusky road, stands Springfield, a small thriving town, which like most of those in this part of the country, is exceedingly neat and clean. In the neighbourhood is a considerable number of English settlers, chiefly farmers from g 2"], [380, "84 SIX MONTHS Yorkshire. There is no doubt that any man who is able and willing to work for his liveli hood, can always, in two or three years, make himself master of a farm, in the back woods, in this or any other part of the Union. The average value of uncleared land, is a hundred dollars for eighty acres. A single man can every where earn at least twelve dollars a month. Provisions are exceedingly cheap ; a sheep or a deer, can be purchased for a dollar ; wheat may be about two shillings the bushel, and an acre of Indian corn, which is only one shilling the bushel, will produce twice the quantity that is raised on an acre of wheat. It is unfortunate that the common class of British emigrants are too much disposed to believe that a land of bberty is identified with a land of promise, and that when they emigrate to America, no difficul ties will ever present themselves. The conse-"], [381, "IN AMERICA. 85 quence is, that exaggerated accounts of their first troubles, bearing no proportion to their real privations, are frequently sent home to their friends in England : but I am convinced from my own observation, and occasional colloquy with my emigrant countrymen, that it must be a man's own fault, however poor he may be at first, if he be not, in a very few years, to use a common phrase, completely above the world; be his occupation what it may. The English and Scotch commonly travel a long way into the western country, where they become farmers and graziers ; the Irish prefer remaining in, or near the principal towns, and what is very unusual in Irishmen, they find employment as road-makers, canal-diggers, or bricklayers. Witness the result of free, and protecting institutions. \u2014 Fifty years ago, the population westward of the Alleghany did not"], [382, "86 SIX MONTHS exceed 15,000; now it amounts to 5,000,000 ! The population of priest-ridden Mexico- has not increased for centuries. Columbus, the capital of the state of Ohio, contains nearly 4Q00 inhabitants. Its appear ance is very promising, but there is nothing in it to detain the traveller. At Mansfield I was obliged to remain a day and a half, in consequence of the late rains having rendered the streams impassable. For tunately I placed myself in very good quar ters, at the inn or tavern, where I met with the greatest civility and attention, and far more comfort and cleanliness than is often found at a country inn in the United States. I passed a whole morning unsuccessfully with my gun in the woods. \" Well, stranger, are you going gunning this morning?\" \"Yes; and pray what game is there in the forest here ? \""], [383, "87 IN AMERICA. I inquired. \" Why, sir, there is robin, and some turkey, and considerable squirrel, about sundown.\" The robin is a very common bird of the fieldfare genus, with a red breast, a little larger than our redwing. However, I met with no turkey, and contented myself with seeing my companion hit or \"scare\" (terrify) the squirrels with his rifle. Sassafras, sarsapa rilla, and ginseng, are found in these forests. The latter root is so plentiful as to be an article of commerce ; great quantities of it are sent to the coast, and exported to China, where, as is well known, it is very highly prized, being considered a panacea. The last five miles into Sandusky, or Port land, lie over a small prairie ; but it is not a good specimen, as the herbage is short, and copses of stunted trees are frequent. Prairies are either dry or wet. The wet prairies are,"], [384, "88 SIX MONTHS in fact, nothing but a marsh covered with long grass, and have been so from any indefinite period of time. Of the dry prairies some may have been originally wet, and some may have been cleared by the Indians, for the purpose of using them as hunting fields. But the former supposition, if the fact could be ascertained, would probably, in most cases, be found to be the true one. The shores of the lake at Sandusky are exceedingly flat. I was fortunate in finding a steam-boat there, which was going to Detroit, Green bay, and the Saut de St. Marie, at the entrance of Lake Superior, and would after wards return to Buffalo. The \" Superior,\" as she was called, was, I think, the most comfort able steamer I had yet entered ; her upper deck, about one hundred and twenty feet in length, was of great width, and afforded a most excel-"], [385, "89 IN AMERICA. lent promenade. We had on board upwards of sixty passengers, many of whom were ladies ; and there was plenty of room for us all, with the advantage of an excellent table, and a small band. The lake afforded us a supply of most delicious fresh water. Soon after leaving San dusky we passed in sight of Put-in-Bay, in the Bass Islands, forming one of the finest natural harbours to be found any where. Commodore Perry lay at anchor there on the night previous to the lOch of September, 1813, on which day he gained his victory over our fleet in the vici nity. Night soon closed in upon us. We passed Maiden, or Amherstburg, as it is more usually called. The British squadron lay at anchor there previously to its engagement with Commodore Perry. A boat pushed off in the darkness, and asked to be taken in tow. \" Who are you?\" very properly asked the captain."], [386, "90 SIX MONTHS \" We, British !\" was the ludicrous answer of some French Canadians, and the steamer passed on. A company of the 79th was stationed at Maiden. In the morning we found ourselves at Detroit: this place was a considerable French settlement so long ago as the year 1759, when it fell with the Canadas into the possession of the British, and is now increasing with a rapidity to which it is fairly entitled by its situation, on the outlet of the great lakes. The French unquestionably displayed their usual tact and foresight in their choice of the different points of communication in the extensive chain of forts which was ori ginally continued from the Canadas to the Mis sissippi \u2014 the proof is, that all of them are of great importance at the present time. A similar but more enlarged instance of this, the highest grade of military strategy, is to be so mid in the vigorous and persevering policy of Great"], [387, "91 IN AMERICA. Britain, which has secured to her a chain of fortresses by which, as a gallant American General-officer expressed himself to me, \" She has check-mated the world.\" The master mind of General Bernard, the eleve and aid-de-camp of Napoleon, and perhaps the first engineer now living, whom I had the honour of meet ing at Washington, has displayed itself in the very extensive and accurate military surveys, which he has taken in almost every part of the United States. The fortifications which he has constructed, have rendered the estuaries of the United States altogether inaccessible to an invading fleet. General Bernard, as is well known, has lately quitted the service of the United States, and returned to France. The wharfs and buildings at Detroit extend along the river side for about a mile, and ex hibit much of the bustle of a commercial town."], [388, "92 SIX MONTHS The streets are spacious and regular, \u2014 the largest is more than half a mile in length, and contains some excellent shops and a capital hotel. That part of the bank upon which the city is built, is slightly elevated above the rest of the country, and commands a view which, although generally flat, is far from being mi in teresting. The farms are laid out in narrow slips of land, which run parallel to each other, and at right angles to the river, reaching to the edge of the forest, distant about two miles from the city. By this means the first settlers were enabled to build their habitations within a short distance of each other ; they had a smaller space of road to keep in repair, and afforded each other a mutual support against the sudden attacks of the Indians. At Detroit, the American General Hull surrendered to General Brock during the last war, but the city"], [389, "IN AMERICA. 93 was subsequently retaken, previously to the battle of the Thames. We entered the lake of St. Clair, \u2014 about thirty miles in length, and twenty five in breadth ; we passed a considerable distance from its banks, but they appeared to be very flat and uninteresting. On the right is the mouth of the river Thames ; made remarkable by the victory obtained over the British by a superior force under the American General Harrison. The celebrated Indian chief, Te cumseh, fell in the engagement ; and the im portance of this victory to the Americans was felt by the dissolution of the hostile Indian confederacy consequent on the death of their leader. On the left of the entrance to the river St. Clair, is a large wet prairie : on the right are several islands, forming to all appearance but"], [390, "94 SIX MONTHS one extensive morass, and abounding in wild fowl. As the channel became narrower, we perceived that the American banks were far more settled than those on the Canada side ; but they soon alike presented nothing but a dense mass of forest trees, at a slight elevation above the water. After moving on for about thirty miles, we arrived at Fort Gratiot at the head of the river ; it contained a small garrison, just sufficiently strong to resist an attack from the Indians. The pay of an American private is eight dollars a month, with an allowance of one ration per diem; but his duties are far harder than those of the British soldier, which accounts for the frequency of desertion. A lieutenant in the army receives but sixty dollars a month, after deduction for subsistence, forage, fuel, quarters, and expenses for servants. The pay of a captain"], [391, "95 IN AMERICA. after the same deduction, amounts to about eighty dollars a month. The stipend of a naval captain amounts altogether to four thousand four hundred dollars a year ; his cabin is furnished better, and the allowance for breakage is more liberal than that of an English officer of the same rank. I here saw an Indian dance : the performers, an old man and his sons, advanced towards us, on a forest path, looking like wood demons, jumping and racing with each other, and utter ing a small shrill cry at intervals ; they were nearly naked, bedaubed all over with clay, and began the dance with light clubs in their hands : sometimes they writhed on the ground like snakes, at others they shook their clubs at each other, and used the wildest and most extrava gant gestures. The old Indian beat time on a small skin stretched across a piece of hollow"], [392, "96 SIX MONTHS tree. When stooping to the ground and look ing upwards, his features and figure reminded me of the celebrated statue of the \" Remouleur \" at Florence. The whole of this part of America is in habited by the Chippewas, by far the largest tribe of Indians on the shores of the great lakes. The waters of Lake Huron had been agitated by a furious north wind, and headed directly on the mouth of the river ; the current was running with such velocity, that the steam boat did not effect her passage without a long and very severe struggle, and when at last fairly out on the lake, she made so little progress that she was obliged to put back. Some of the passengers amused themselves with fishing, and caught some black bass; as for myself, I pro ceeded with two Indians in a canoe to the morass opposite the fort, which abounded in"], [393, "IN AMERICA. 97 wild fowl of all kinds; I contrived to shoot seve ral ducks, notwithstanding the unseasonable cries raised by the Indians in token of their delight, on seeing a bird fall. Their quickness of sight and hearing answered nearly all the purposes of a water spaniel, when I could not immedi ately find a wounded bird. At length we made another attempt, and entered the vast expanse of Lake Huron. The coast on the right stretched away to the north nearly at right angles ; and we gradually lost sight of it. Our course was along the western shore, where the banks were, or seemed to be, a little higher ; but still very low, appearing nowhere to exceed thirty feet in height. The unbroken and inter minable forest, with which they are covered, contains more game than any other part bor dering on the lakes, being less frequented by VOL. II. H"], [394, "98 SIX MONTHS hunters. The American elk (the wapiti of the Egyptian Hall), the moose, and common deer are found there, with plenty of bears, wolves, and other wild inhabitants of the forest; the moose has the power of remaining under water for a very long time, and, when in danger, has been known to plunge into a pool, and remain at the bottom for more minutes than I care to mention here. We steered directly for the Saut de St. Marie, at the foot of Lake Superior, and distant two hundred and twenty miles. One mile of the coast on any of these lakes will give a very tolerable idea of the whole of them, with, of course, some exceptions. Yet although there was but little variety in this respect, the voyage was exceedingly interesting. The fineness of the weather, the cool breeze so refreshing after the sultry heat to which I had been exposed, the"], [395, "99 IN AMERICA. comparative absence of musquitos, and the ever present recollection that we were sailing on the great lakes of North America, where, compara tively speaking, so few had been before me, gave a tone to the excursion that compensated for more commanding scenery. As we passed Saganaw bay, we were very nearly out of sight of land. The Mannito, or Spirit islands were the next objects that presented themselves to our view: these are supposed by the Indians to be inhabited by spirits, the word mannito in the Indian language, signifying spirit. We then passed Drummond Island, which during the last war contained a British fort and garri son, but has been since abandoned. Some ruins on the large island of St. Joseph were visible from the steam boat ; they were the remains of a fort, which was suffered to fall to decay, previously to the fortifications being erected on h 2"], [396, "100 SIX MONTHS Drummond's Island. On the American bank, near the entrance of the river St. Marie, we observed a spot called the Sailor's Encampment. The forest had been partially cleared away, and there was no vestige of humanity remain ing. Some years ago, a sloop was wrecked there ; the crew suffered incredible hardships, and many of them died from want, before the survivors contrived to make their escape. We entered a cluster of small islands at the mouth of the river, and I thought this the finest piece of lake scenery I had yet witnessed; as far as I could judge en passant, they appeared to be chiefly composed of gneiss, lying in large masses of rock, resembling those that are so common in some parts of Sweden. In comparing these with the islands of Killarney, and Loch-Lomond, I should remark, that the full rich foliage did not seem complete without the arbutus; and"], [397, "101 IN AMERICA. the dark tint of the fir trees, with which they were covered, was not relieved as in the Scottish lake, by the exquisitely delicate appearance of the weephig birch. It was a remarkably fine evening : as the steamer passed rapidly on, her paddles seemed to take infinite pleasure in defacing the aston ished surface of the water, and splashed -away through the liquid crystal with as little ceremony as if they had been propelling a mere ferry boat. Every thing besides was hushed and tranquil : the very passengers, who had all assembled near the forward part of the deck, were intensely gazing upon the scene around them ; and watched in almost breathless silence, as the vessel rounded each bend in the deep, but com paratively narrow river, that developed in quick succession some new and more beautiful object at every turn. Suddenly we heard the screams"], [398, "102 SIX MONTHS of a party of Indians, who had descried us from their wigwams on one of the islands, and were paddling after us in a canoe with all their might. One of them was a chief, who displayed the flag of the United States. In the course of the afternoon, we had been amusing ourselves by shooting with rifles at a bottle attached to a line about forty yards in length; this had been left hanging from the stern, and the endeavours of the Indians to catch hold of the string afforded us no little amusement. Their faces were deeply stained with the red extract from the blood root ( Sanguinaria Canadensis) ; they were in the best possible humour, and their wild dis cordant laugh, and the still wilder expression of their features, as they encouraged each other to exertion with quickly repeated and guttural exclamations, enabled us to form some idea of their animated appearance, when excited to"], [399, "103 IN AMERICA. deeds of a more savage description. By dint of the greatest exertion, they contrived to seize the string ; they held on for a moment by it ; it snapped, and the canoe was instantly running astern at the rate of seven or eight knots. They again had recourse to their paddles, and used them with redoubled energy ; we then slackened our pace for a minute or two, and threw them a rope, by which they soon pulled themselves under the stern. We conversed with them through the medium of an interpreter, and made them presents of bread and spirits. They seemed very thankful, threw us some pigeons which they had killed, and fired a feu-de-joie with their fowling-pieces at parting. The next morning we came in sight of the Saut, resembling the inclined plane of a large artificial dam. The scenery, though not grand, was decidedly curious and picturesque."], [400, "104 SIX MONTHS On the right are the Canadian settlements, and the original establishments of the north-west company : the left bank is lined by a succession of small neat-looking country houses and white cottages. Near the Saut stands the fort, large enough to contain three companies ; but then garrisoned, I believe, with but eighty men. Every thing about it was in excellent order : before our drawing up to the landing-place, we were boarded by several Indians with moc casins (leathern sandals), belts, tobacco pouches, and bark work, for sale. The Saut de St. Marie most effectually prevents any vessel from ascending the river to Lake Superior, excepting such as are light enough to be towed up. As the steam-boat could not proceed farther, we embarked in canoes on a small canal, which has been cut from the fort to the river above the Saut, and"], [401, "IN AMERICA. 105 paddled away for the entrance of the lake. Immediately after I had started, my canoe began to leak ; she was instantly drawn on shore by the Indians close to a wigwam, and turned keel upwards. A light-coloured pitch, ex tracted from a species of pine, was boiled in about ten minutes. A piece of canvass was then besmeared with it, and laid over the leak on the outside. Another layer of pitch was followed by another piece of canvass, and then a third and last plaster of the pitch was spread over the whole. In a quarter of an hour she was again launched perfectly water tight. These canoes are of a light and most elegant con struction. They are made of birch bark ex tended over a slight frame of cedar, and fastened or rather sewed to it, by the flexible roots of the young spruce tree. They are usually about fifteen feet in length, and can carry seven or"], [402, "106 SIX MONTHS eight persons without danger. Some of them, however, are much larger. The land on each side of the river pre sented much the same appearance as that we had hitherto seen. Lake Superior may be fairly said to commence at the Point aux Pins, a flat sandy promontory, distant about six miles from the Saut. Beyond it, the surface of the water is suddenly enlarged to a width of three or four miles; and though the open expanse of the lake is not visible from the Point, yet the high and abrupt ridges of land that rise immediately at the entrance of the lake, and the clear expanse of cloudless sky that was extended beyond them, clearly informed us, that the mighty inland ocean was near at hand. Lake Superior is six hundred and seventy miles in length \u2014 of course a vast deal larger than the British Channel, \u2014 the water is as clear as"], [403, "107 IN AMERICA. crystal, and cool in the hottest weather. Being chiefly supplied by land springs, the quantity of water that falls over the Saut is much greater than that which is poured into the lake by its tributary rivers and streams, which are com paratively small and insignificant. The sailors in the steam-boat would occasionally peel a large potatoe, and throw it in advance of the boat, and by the time she arrived at the spot where it fell, the potatoe has sunk to the depth of thirty or forty feet, but from the clearness of the water, its shape and colour were per fectly distinct. Of all the different places we touched at on our voyage, the Saut had the strongest claims on our time and attention. We were much mortified at being obliged to leave it the same afternoon. The captain determining to return, contrary, I believe, to the wish of"], [404, "108 SIX MONTHS every one on board. Only one or two canoes that had started earlier than the Others, were able to proceed farther than the Point aux Pins. In our way back to the steamer, every canoe shot down the Saut. This is an exceedingly dangerous experiment, except when they are guided by people who have been long accus tomed to the management of them. The Saut, which is the only outlet to the waters of Lake Superior, may be about one-third of a mile in width, and about half-a-mile in length ; the fall in that space being about twenty-four feet. The canoes, with the paddles fore and aft, soon began to feel the effect of the current, and were immediately after carried forward with great velocity. In many places the waters were with out foam, and perfectly transparent, and the large loose rocks at the bottom were distinctly seen ; many of them rise nearly to the surface,"], [405, "IN AMERICA. 109 but were avoided by the remarkable dexterity of the steersman, where the slightest want of skill must inevitably have overturned the canoe. The descent occupied between three or four minutes. The rapids on the left bank were evidently more furious, and are very seldom descended. The Saut de St. Marie was originally occu pied by the French as a military and trading port. At the foot of the rapids there is, I was informed, some of the finest fly-fishing in the world: the trout are very fine, in enormous quantities, and rise very freely. But our in exorable captain cared for none of these things. White-fish (supposed by some to be of the salmo genus), are also exceedingly plentiful. Their flavour is remarkably fine and delicate. The next morning we approached the island of Michilimackinac, signifying in the Indian"], [406, "110 SIX MONTHS language, the Great Turtle ; and so called from its outline bearing a supposed resemblance to that animal when lying upon the water, though I cannot say that I could discover so flattering a likeness. When within a short distance it appeared to be diamond-shaped, with an angle projecting towards us, and the sides regularly scarped by the hand of nature. Apparently about the centre of the island rises what in America is called a \"bluff;\" a word which is provoking from its absurdity, and constant recurrence in American descrip tions of scenery. What is a bluff?\u2014 I asked, and so would any other Englishman : \"A bluff, sir ! don't you know what a bluff is ? A bluff, sir, is a piece of rising ground, partly rock, not all of it, with one side steep, but yet not very steep, the other side sloping away, yet not too suddenly ; the whole of it, except the steep"], [407, "IN AMERICA. 111 side, covered with wood; in short, sir, a bluff is a bluff ! \" The word, I think, may do well enough to express a small rough rocky hill, but sometimes it happens that a bluff is highly picturesque, and then to talk of a most beautiful bluff, is something like talking of \" Beauty and the Beast.\" As a substantive, and, in the sense in which it is used in America, the word is exclusively their own, and it really would not be fair to call it English. Nevertheless, there is, and shall be, \" a bluff\" in the midst of the island of Michi limackinac, rising to the height of more than three hundred feet above the waters of the lake, which have been ascertained to be about six hundred feet above the level of the Atlan tic. On the left side of the island is the town, and above it appeared the fort. In the bay were several trading sloops, smaller craft, and"], [408, "112 SIX MONTHS Indian canoes ; and the sun shone brilliantly on the whole of this enlivening scene, which we saw to the best advantage. The town may contain about eight hundred inhabitants, exclu sively of the garrison. The Indians are some times to be seen in great numbers, even to the amount of one thousand or one thousand five hundred, who live in wigwams close to the water's edge. A wigwam, or Indian village, is a collection of small tents constructed of mat ting and birch bark. The day before, we had met twenty-two canoes in the open lake, each containing seven or eight Indians, who were going from Mackinac to our settlement at Pen y-tang-y-shen, on Lake Huron, to receive their annual presents from the British government. Mackinac is the rendezvous of the North West American missionary establishment. It contained six missionaries ; of whom four were"], [409, "113 IN AMERICA. Presbyterian, one a Catholic, and one of the Church of England, and a large establishment for the instruction of one hundred children, of whatever persuasion. A very curious and regularly shaped natural Gothic arch, on the top of a rock at the north eastern side, elevated about two hundred feet above the level of the lake ; a huge isolated calcareous rock; and a small cave called Skull Cave, are the natural curiosities of the island. The principal trade is the fur trade, which is carried on there to a great extent, chiefly through the medium of Canadian voyageurs. The fort, which is kept in admirable order, commands the whole town, but is itself com manded by another eminence in the woods be hind it. During the late war a strong party of British and Indians pushed across from Drum mond's Island, with eleven pieces of cannon, and vol. n. 1"], [410, "114 SIX MONTHS being favoured by the darkness of the night, contrived to gain this eminence, distant half-a mile, without being perceived by the Americans in the fort, who had not received notice of the war having broken out. They beat the \" reveil lee\" as usual in the morning, and were exceed ingly astonished to hear it immediately answered by the British, who were above them. Resist ance would have been useless, and the fort surrendered. The remains of the old British fortification are still to be seen upon the hill : it is called Fort Holmes, after Major Holmes, a gallant American officer, who was advancing to retake it, and met his fate at the head of the attacking column. Mackinac was given up to the Americans by the treaty of Ghent, in 1814. There was originally a French fort and settle ment on the main land of the Michigan terri tory. The first British garrison who occupied"], [411, "115 IN AMERICA. it were murdered by the Indians, and the fort and settlement were afterwards removed by the British to the island. I amused myself with shooting pigeons, which are to be found on the island in great numbers. I was quite surprised at the extraor dinary facility and quickness of eye, with which my guide, half Indian and half Canadian, dis covered them sitting in the thickest foliage; his sight seemed to me to be far keener them that of an English sportsman when looking for a hare. The woods with which the island is co vered, are principally composed of hazel and maple; I could have fancied myself in a Kentish preserve, but that wild raspberries were in great abundance in the open spaces. In the evening I went to see the Indians spear fish by torch light. A lighted roll of birch bark, emitting a most vivid flame, was i 2"], [412, "116 SIX MONTHS held over the head of the boat, where the In dians were stationed with their spears. The water was excessively clear, and the fish were attracted by the light, and several of them were instantly pinned to the ground at the depth of four or five feet. About ten miles north-east of Mackinac are the St. Martin's islands; one of them abounds in gypsum. At about the same distance from Mackinac and on the main land, I was informed that there was a remarkably fine trout stream that would amply repay the fly-fisher for his trouble in going there. There is no fly fish ing at Mackinac, but very fine fish are to be taken with a bait : they have pike, bass, white fish, and what are called salmon -trout, in great perfection. As to these last, I very much question whether they are of the salmo genus at all; as they never rise at a fly. They"], [413, "117 IN AMERICA. certainly are not what are called salmon-trout by English sportsmen, nor are they the large butt trout of the English lakes. I saw a boat-load containing a dozen that had been caught in one night weighing from fifteen to twenty pounds each ; they more resembled in every respect the fish called the salmon in the Lake Wenner in Sweden, and which I have seen taken of an enormous size below the falls of Trollhatta. The meat at this season (August) was white, but well flavoured. I was informed that it becomes of a reddish colour in October or November. Mackinac is an excellent market for Indian curiosities. Our next destination was Green bay, on Lake Michigan. On our way we passed se veral fine-looking islands, \u2014 all thickly covered with forests, and apparently uninhabited. A fort"], [414, "118 SIX MONTHS and a flourishing settlement are to be seen at Green bay ; but there is nothing attractive about either, and the country is very flat and unin teresting, except to a sportsman. There are plenty of wild fowl to be found at Duck creek, about three miles off, and I proceeded there in hopes of shooting some, but did not fall in with them until it was too late to have much sport. However, I chanced to meet an old Indian who had been more successful, and I carried back to the steam-boat two silver ducks, which answered every purpose, as no questions were asked. My guide had been enumerating to me the different wild animals to be found in that part of the forest, and I chanced to ask him, if foxes were plentiful; his answer was amusing, \"Yes, sir; there is considerable fox.\" In the very darkest part of the forest, about two and a half miles from the mouth of the"], [415, "IN AMERICA. 119 creek, was the residence of an Indian doctress and fortune-teller. I landed there out of curi osity to have my fortune told ; but her manner, her language, and the substance of what she said, differed in no respect from that of a com mon English gipsy woman. She shuffled a dirty pack of cards, and told me of the fair lady and the dark lady, the false friend and the true friend, the treasure to be found and the journey to be taken, with the same chapter of accidents and unavoidable dangers. I pur chased some of her medical herbs : the principal plant was sarsaparilla. I observed wild rice growing in great abundance on the margin of the stream. By passing up the river at Green bay, a traveller may proceed in canoes down the Wis kansaw river to the head of the Mississippi, having only to pass over one mile of terra firma;"], [416, "120 SIX MONTHS so that with this single exception, the whole distance from Quebec to New Orleans may be travelled by water. We left Green bay, and returned to Mac kinac, and passed the day much in the same manner as before. Our evening's entertainment was rather of a novel description. A Catholic priest, whom we had previously left at Mac kinac, and who was known to be an eloquent man, was going to preach in the chapel, and accordingly many of us went to hear him: he had come to the island for the sole purpose of holding a religious controversy with some of the Presbyterian clergy. The expected meet ing did not however take place ; and having been, or fancying himself to have been very much wronged, he entered into a long expla nation of the whole affair. He read letters and papers, and commented upon them in his robes"], [417, "IN AMERICA. 121 from the altar; he made a long tirade, in which sarcasm and ridicule were successively promi nent, and wound up his speech more suited to the bar than the pulpit, by accusing his adver sary of telling a \" thumper.\" Whether he was in the right or the wrong was little to the pur pose : in common, I believe, with every one that heard him, I thought the whole proceeding was exceedingly disgraceful. We now steered again for Fort Gratiot, and passed to Detroit and Lake Erie. From Detroit to Buffalo it is three hundred and fifty miles. We touched at several posts ; and in short, after a voyage of one thousand eight hun dred and ten miles, performed in nineteen days, we arrived at Buffalo, and fired a salute of twenty-four guns, one for each state. The distances the steam-boat had passed over were as follows. From Buffalo to Detroit, three hun-"], [418, "122 SIX MONTHS dred and fifty miles ; to Fort Gratiot, seventy five ; length of Lake Huron, two hundred and twenty; from the mouth of the river St. Marie to the Saut, and back to the Lake, one hun dred miles ; thence to Mackinac, forty miles ; to Green bay, one hundred and eighty ; back to Mackinac, one hundred and eighty more ; thence to Fort Gratiot, two hundred and forty ; to Detroit, seventy-five ; to Buffalo, three hundred and fifty ; total, one thousand eight hundred and ten miles. The voyage altogether had been very pleasant, and the weather so favourable that quadrilles were danced on deck almost every evening. On one night only, the surface of Lake Huron was agitated by something like a squall, and the rolling of the steam-boat was exceedingly disagreeable. I had nothing to complain of, but the conceit and untameable insolence of the stewards ; which were remarked,"], [419, "123 IN AMERICA. and I have no doubt will be remembered, by many of the warmest admirers of liberty and equality who were on board. Buffalo is a large, thriving and cheerful town, containing about fourteen thousand inhabitants. The principal street is spacious and handsome, and of great length. And now for Niagara, the diapason of fresh waters ! An hour's drive brought me to the village of Black Rock, where the Nigara river is about half a mile in breadth, and runs from the lake with a very strong current. Opposite to Black Rock are the remains of Fort Erie, unsuccessfully besieged by the British in 1814. I proceeded along the side of the river. Its rapidity soon ceases, and it presents a surface as still and as calm as that of a lake. A turn of the road brought my voiture to a small inn, close to the field of battle of Chippewa, fought"], [420, "124 SIX MONTHS during the last war. At this spot, which by the road is about four miles distant, we were within hearing of the deep hollow roar of the cataract, and first saw the spray that arose from the gulph beneath. Both are sometimes percep tible at a far greater distance. The moon was just rising, and threw a faint, pale light over the river, which is here expanded to a breadth of several miles. There was scarcely a ripple to be seen ; the whole sheet of water was tran quil and resigned : the stream appeared to cease flowing, while all nature, hushed and breath less, listened with it to the distant thunders of the cataract. This scene is continued for about a mile further, and thence the tale is soon told. The bed of the river begins to slope, and the agitation of the waters indicate the commence ment of the rapids. The mighty stream rushes forward with ungovernable violence \u2014 its con-"], [421, "IN AMERICA. 125 fusion and exasperation are increased every instant \u2014 it nears the brink of the precipice in a state of frenzy \u2014 and bounds over it to its destiny of mist and foam, in unexampled volume, and with terrific impetuosity. This stupendous fall has been frequently and well described; and I do but trespass on your patience in remarking, that it is divided into three parts by two islands \u2014 a larger and a smaller one. Including these, the bed of the river immediately above the fall is suddenly narrowed to about three quarters of a mile. The fall of the rapids above, commencing near the village of Chippawa, two miles from the brink of the cataract, is estimated at ninety feet. On the American side, the river is pre cipitated from a height of one hundred and sixty-four feet: on the Canadian bank, the fall is about ten feet less ; but contains by far the"], [422, "126 SIX MONTHS greater quantity of water, the precipice having been worn into the form of a vast crescent by the \"green water,\" (so called on account of its brilliantly transparent colour when the sun shines on it), which falls from the middle of the river in a solid mass, not less than five or six feet in thickness, and is driven forwards with an impetus that hurls it into the gulph below, at a distance of fifty feet from the base of the rock. The finest general view is, I think, to be obtained from the top of Mr. Forsyth's hotel (where, be it added, having just entered the British dominions, we drank his Majesty's health in a bumper, at the table d'hote), because the whole surrounding country and the rapids, which of themselves are worth a long journey, are seen at the same time. The bottom of the fall it is true is not visible ; but I believe the view"], [423, "IN AMERICA. 127 will not be thought the less magnificent on that account, as it is very possible from that spot to imagine the height of the fall to be even greater than it really is. I may also be allowed to remark, that I think the immediately surrounding scenery is sufficiently in keeping with the grandeur of the cataract, although I am aware that many are of a different opinion. The country is on the same level both above and below the fall, as the river precipitates itself into a channel which it has formed in the solid, but soft fetid limestone, and which, as is usually contended, has been hollowed out by the receding cataract, all the way from Lewis town, distant seven miles. This fact has been sometimes doubted, but it would appear, without much reason. It has been ascertained that an irregular ledge of rock is extended between the lakes Erie and Ontario,"], [424, "128 SIX MONTHS at a varying distance from either of them; some times piercing through the soil that covers it, and in many places jutting out with salient and re-entering angles, like an immense fortifi cation; and it has been supposed that the Niagara river has found its way into one of the ravines formed between them, which has thus become the bed of the river, towards lake Ontario. This theory, however, is very much weakened, if not entirely overthrown, by the observations of our countryman, Lieutenant Owen, who, when employed on the government surveys in the years 1815, 16, 17 and 18, contrived to force his boat nearer to the foot of, the falls than any person had ever done, and ascertained by repeated soundings, that the nearly con stant depth of the river from Lewistown to the falls, was about two hundred feet, excepting in limited spaces, where it did not exceed forty-"], [425, "IN AMERICA. 129 five feet. These spaces or points he conceived to be composed of granite \" in situ,\" or of some other rock, which being harder than the soft lime-stone of which the bed of the river is generally composed, had offered a proportion ably greater resistance to the regular action of the falling element. Having first stripped off my clothes, and enveloped myself in an oilskin dress, I followed a guide, who conducted me under the fall. This is a service of some danger, as a single false step in some places might prove fatal. As we crept along the side of the rock we encountered a most furious gust of wind, that increased in violence till we were fairly behind the sheet of water, and arrived at what is called the Termi nation Rock. Here we remained for a few minutes, gasping for breath, stunned with the noise, and drenched with a shower of spray. If VOL. II. K."], [426, "130 SIX MONTHS I wished to speak I was obliged to put my mouth close to the ear of the guide, and to raise my voice to the utmost; and it was with the greatest difficulty that I could look upwards for a moment, and glance at the tumbling element, as it rushed over the edge of the rock that towered high above our heads, and then fell into the abyss within arm's length of us, with the rapidity of lightning. About half-a-mile below the fall, the river is crossed in a ferry-boat. On the American side a wooden bridge of admirable construction conducts the visiter to Goat Island, the larger of the two which divides the fall. A walk of a few minutes will lead him to another bridge, thrown from rock to rock, till it actually over hangs the edge of the principal part of the cata ract. I am fully persuaded, that when any one who has seen the fall from this spot asserts"], [427, "IN AMERICA. 131 that he is disappointed, it is but a proof of insufferable affectation, or what Johnson would call \"stark insensibility.\" It is possible, that some flat-souled Dutchman, who would think of nothing but how he might turn the course of the river by a dam ; or some passionless manu facturing Yankee, who would \" guess it to be a pity that such an all-mighty water power should remain unemployed,\" might regard the scene, when viewed from any other point, and remain unmoved by its grandeur ; but it is next to impossible to look upon it from this bridge, and not be affected with something like awe and astonishment. Let the atheist \u2014 and, if he will, with wine and warmth in his bosom \u2014 re pair to this spot, as is usual, by moonlight, when one-half of the cataract is in shade, and the other glistening with more than snowy white ness, \u2014 he may there gaze in security, and k 2"], [428, "132 SIX MONTHS enjoy the sublime without terror; but should one thought of annihilation trouble him \u2014 should he covet the pinion of the bald eagle as he fearlessly glides over the abyss, or envy the finned tribe that can live and revel in the boil ing gulf beneath \u2014 let him reflect, that his reason is with him, the undoubted substitute for these physical advantages; his reason, alike the promoter of his happiness and the medium of his misery. Then, turning to a more tran quil scene, let him gaze on the silvery spirit like beauties of the lunar rainbow; let him observe the worlds upon worlds that throng the heavens above him, declaring the existence of their Creator as they roll onward in eternal obedience to his will, but in silent amazement at his meaning ; and let him ask why his reason should be, as it were, so tantalized by his senses. Had no lesson been intended, the firmament"], [429, "133 IN AMERICA. might as well have been placed far beyond the reach of mortal sight, and perhaps the little he can see and know of it may teach him to believe in, and hope for, another and happier home, by proving to him, at once, how much must be withheld from him, and how much must remain to be enjoyed. I am not aware whether the experiment has ever been tried, but I should conceive that the effect of a Bengal light sent up from this bridge, on a dark stormy winter's night, would be ex ceedingly fine. At about two miles below the fall, the river again becomes a torrent. I proceeded along the edge of the chasm through which it rages, in order to visit \" the' Whirlpool,\" whose deep and gloomy appearance well repaid me for a very hot walk. I procured a hack, aud rode to the abyss in"], [430, "134 SIX MONTHS the side of the river, known by the appellation of the \" Devil's Hole.\" I followed a party who had descended the ladders before me; we all, as I learned afterwards, took a wrong path to the right, which soon conducted us to the edge of a small but impassable precipice, and under the impression that we had seen all that was worth seeing, we re-ascended the ladders and returned to Niagara, after having enjoyed a very fine view of the river from the bold flat tened rock, that is projected on the left hand. The road by which I passed down the Cana dian side of the river, for the purpose of join ing the steam-boat on Lake Ontario, at but a very short distance from Niagara, lies over the field of the murderous and severely contested battle of Bridgewater, or Lundy's Lane, which was fought on the night of the 25th of July, 1814, and terminated without much advantage"], [431, "135 IN AMERICA. to either party. A few miles further on, to the left, is a heavy-looking pillar, erected to the memory of General Brock, who was killed early in the battle of Queenston, October 13, 1812, in which the Americans were forced to repass the river with great loss, whilst several thousands of their militia were idly looking on from the other bank. Near the mouth of the river, on the Cana dian side, is Fort George; on the American bank stands Fort Niagara, in which the notorious William Morgan, who wrote a book, in which, as I have before remarked, he revealed the secrets of freemasonry, was confined under false pretences, previously to his being murdered by some fanatic masons, and afterwards, as it is sup posed, pitched into the lake, or the Niagara river. I am afraid I shall be excommunicated by my American readers, as I visited neither she"], [432, "136 SIX MONTHS Erie nor the Welland Canals; not even the Locks at Lockport, or the Deep Cut, or the Mountain Ridge. The Welland canal, how ever, is unquestionably a great national work, and reflects much credit upon the spirited indi viduals by whom it was undertaken; by its means, the obstacles presented to navigation by the falls of the Niagara, have been effectually overcome, and a communication opened between the lakes Erie and Ontario. Ontario is one of the deepest of the lakes ; its mean depth being about six hundred feet. It has been ascertained that the bottom of lake Erie, which is two hundred and seventy miles in length, is six feet higher than the surface of lake Ontario. The distance between the two lakes is thirty-five miles, in which space the river Niagara is supposed to fall about three hundred feet, which is therefore the depth of lake Erie."], [433, "IN AMERICA. 137 I embarked in a splendid steam-boat, \" the Great Britain,\" proceeding to Kingston, at the other end of the lake. I could not but remark, that although a finer vessel, her table was by no means so well supplied as that of the American boat in which I had made my excur sion to the great lakes. During the short time we remained at King ston we were entertained by the band of the 66th, which gave us the national airs of England and -America in the finest style : the principal British naval establishment and dockyard on the lakes, is at Kingston. I observed two first-raters and a large frigate on the stocks. The St. Law rence, of one hundred and twenty guns, which made one cruise at the end of the last war, was rotten, and half sunk in the water. There were several smaller vessels in ordinary, but those on the stocks are not to be proceeded with, accord ing to the stipulations of the treaty of Ghent."], [434, "138 SIX MONTHS Immediately afterwards, we entered the thousand \" islands,\" extending for sixty miles up the river St. Lawrence. There are in fact, twelve hundred of them, and although certainly very picturesque, are without variety, and much resemble those on the lakes, being flat and thickly covered with trees. Their number is not of course perceived, as they lie so closely together along the side of the channel that they appear more like points or promontories from the main shore. I quitted the steamer at Cornwall, and en tered a large boat with a number of ladies and gentlemen who, like myself, wished to descend the rapids. In our way to Montreal we were obliged to change our mode of travelling by land and water, no less than four times in one day. The river above Montreal is full of rapids. The most formidable of these are called the"], [435, "IN AMERICA. 139 Long Saut and the rapids of the Cedars. We passed down two or three of minor consideration, and then commenced the descent of the \" Long Saut.\" Our boat was carried along at a great rate for several miles, and soon approached the only part that can be considered dangerous, where the river was running with appalling violence. The waves as soon as they are formed, do not subside and then swell up again at regular distances, but dart furiously onward, racing and crowding upon each other in a most extraordi nary confusion of spray and foam, that rises to a height of four or five feet, and splashes over the sides of the boat, to the great discom fiture of the ladies' dresses, and the very serious looks of the gentlemen. The boatmen directed our attention to the rapids of the \" Lost Chan nel\" on our left, from which we were divided by an island. They are far more dangerous"], [436, "140 SIX MONTHS than those we were passing, and at a distance of half-a-mile, we could see that the river was most terribly agitated. The \" Lost Channel\" receives its name from the number of persons that have perished there. In the old French war, three hundred British troops were lost in the torrent; the first boat took the wrong channel, the others followed, and all went to pieces. The floating bodies first intimated to a French garrison on the river below, the sur prise that had been intended for them. The boatmen are of course usually experienced per sons, and if sober there is no danger; but it is not always that they are so. At one place our tipsy pilots allowed the boat to swing across the stream: fortunately the worst of the rapids were passed, or an accident might have occurred. Both the Long Saut and those of the Cedars which we saw from the road, are"], [437, "141 IN AMERICA. certainly more boisterous than those at the Saut de St. Marie, on account of the greater body of water in the St. Lawrence, but the descent at the latter is more rapid as the fall is far more precipitate in proportion to its length. I entered a steam-boat on the banks of the Ottawa, which although a noble-looking stream in other respects, is dark and dirty in compa rison with the St. Lawrence. The latter river seems not to relish the alliance. A sudden change is perceivable in the colour of the water, the line of junction being distinctly observable ; and for scores of miles down the St. Lawrence, its clearer waters confine themselves to the eastern bank, while those on the western are discoloured by the \" Ottawa tide.\" I afterwards ascended the Ottawa. We arrived at La Chine, and proceeded by land to Montreal. The mountain behind it was already in sight, but"], [438, "142 SIX MONTHS the city itself by this road, remained hidden till we were within a very few miles of it. I passed through it the same evening, intending to see it on my return. The Hercules, a very fine steam-boat, carried me to Quebec in about twenty hours ; touching at \" the Three Rivers,\" eighty-four miles from Quebec, and ninety-six from Montreal. Six miles from Quebec, we passed the mouth of the Chaudiere river, cele brated for its falls, which are situated about three or four miles from the spot where it empties itself into the St. Lawrence, whose banks, every where interesting, become still more so on approaching Quebec, being thickly lined with Canadian villages. Every cottage is white ; the churches are of the same colour, with their spires covered with tin, and are fre quently to be seen at a great distance out topping the neighbouring forest and glistening"], [439, "IN AMERICA. 143 in the sunbeam. In some places the river is two miles in width; but at Quebec it is nar rowed to about a mile, which adds to the beauty of the view by making the lofty banks appear higher than they really are. On the left are seen the fortifications on Cape Diamond, the most elevated spot in the vicinity of the city. On the right is Point Levi. At different distances down the river are Cape Tourment and the Beaufort mountains, and the Isle of Orleans, dividing the river into two channels \u2014 that on the left being dangerous for any but very small vessels. The city itself was not visible till the boat was standing in for the landing-place. Numerous merchant ships were lying at anchor in different parts of the river; whilst rafts, ferry-boats, and smaller craft, were moving in all directions. The Government House, or Castle of St. Louis, was the most"], [440, "144 SIX MONTHS prominent object : below it on the right, is the old parliament house. The space which inter venes between these buildings and the water, is occupied by the lower town, which like all lower towns, is far more dirty and lively than the upper ones, where some of the streets are dull and even gloomy. The only two large steeples in Quebec, are those of the Protestant and Catholic churches. The upper town is surrounded by a strong rampart, and cannon are planted in every place where they could be used with advantage in case of a siege. The whole city is commanded by the fortress on Cape Diamond, which it is supposed, when finished, will be impregnable. The interior works occupy a space of about six acres, and are advanced to the edge of the precipice, where it is about three hundred and fifty feet in height. In 1775, the American General Montgomery"], [441, "IN AMERICA. 145 and his two aides-de-camp were killed by the same cannon-shot at the water's edge beneath the fort. I think I shall never forget the appearance of the view from the ramparts. It is very beautiful and inexpressibly enlivening. In look ing down the river, the isle d'Orleans is on the right; in the extreme distance is Cape Tourment ; while on the left is a gently sloping bank, exhibiting all the varied hues of extensive cultivation, between thirty and forty miles in length, and from two to five and six miles in width, and reaching from the margin of the water to the foot of the Beaufort mountains. The most conspicuous villages are Indian Lo rette, Charleburg, Beaufort, and the Chateau Richer, easily distinguished by their light steeples covered with tin. Beside these, many hundreds of white cottages are scattered over the plain ; and the road to Montmorenci is VOL. II. L"], [442, "146 SIX MONTHS entirely lined with them. I was reminded by the prospect, of the highly cultivated garden that environs a city on the eastern coast of Spain. Olive trees and vineyards, it is true, there were none ; but olive trees and vineyards are not missed at a great distance, and the Charleburg country is backed by the fine range of the Beaufort mountains, which although not of the highest elevation, can yet boast of a very picturesque outline; and being thickly covered with a noble forest, have at least one advantage over the barren rocks that usually rear their heads in the vicinity of a Spanish \" vega.\" On the south side of the city, at a distance of two miles, are the plains of Abraham, and at their further extremity, is Wolfe's cave. The view from the bank above is scarcely less en chanting than that I had so lately turned from. On the western horizon are seen the mountains which by the late decision of the king of the"], [443, "147 IN AMERICA. Netherlands are to form the boundary line between the Canadas and the United States. The intermediate landscape is most delightful; large yellow patches of cultivation rescued from the apparently endless forest, are espied in dif- ferent directions, each surrounding some thriving village in the interior, whilst the opposite banks of the river are fringed with Canadian cottages, as white as lime and brush can make them ; and the intervening and majestic waters of the St. Lawrence having at length escaped from the turbulence of the rapids, are seen flowing be- neath, as calmly and as silently, as when, during the darkness of a night more than seventy years ago, the gallant Wolfe was floated on the retiring tide to his victory and his grave. Till within a year or two, the stone close to which he breathed his last, was remaining on the field ; but the proprietor, a person of infinite taste, has had it removed, part of it having been used for the purposes of the builder, while other l 2"], [444, "148 SIX MONTHS parts of it are constantly undergoing a process of subdivision for the benefit of the curious. A plain, but very elegant stone obelisk, worth a dozen such as Washington's monument at Baltimore, or General Brock's at Queen's Town Heights, had been lately erected to the memory of Wolfe and Montcalm. The idea of paying this late tribute to the memory of those illustri ous soldiers, originated with Lord Dalhousie. A singularly chaste classical inscription from the pen of Dr. Fisher, the editor of the Quebec Gazette, will be engraved in front of the monu ment. It is as follows: WOLFE MONTCALM. Mortem. Virtus. Communem. Famam. Historia. MoNUMENTUM PoSTERITAS. Dedit. A. S. 1827."], [445, "149 IN AMERICA. A longer inscription will be placed on the other side of the monument. An aged nun is now living in the Ursuline convent at Quebec, who remembers having held a taper when the remains of the chivalrous Frenchman were low ered to his grave in the chapel vault. I saw a small oval slab of marble, which was shortly to be fixed in the wall near the spot where he is buried. It bore the following inscription: \u2014 \" Honheur a Montcalm : ledest in en lui dero bant la victoire, 1' a recompense par une mort glorieuse.\" Quebec was taken from the French in the reign of Charles I., 130 years before the death of Wolfe, but being thought of little value, was given up in the same reign to Louis XIII., by the treaty of St. Germain. At Lorette are to be purchased the best Indian moccassins, and other leathern curiosities, at the house of Mere Paul. The three Huron chiefs who visited England in 1825, and who"], [446, "150 six months were introduced in the first circles in London, may now be seen, any hot day, sober or intoxi cated, just as it may happen, sitting perhaps in the dust, before the doors of their cottages. They take great pleasure in showing the medals and portraits they received in England, and the queen, or wife of the principal chief \u2014 a short, dumpy, masculine woman \u2014 occasionally comes to Quebec to sell moccassins, and has no abori ginal antipathy to a glass of gin. She con stantly wears in her bosom (and very close to it too) a silver medal, presented to her hus band by the Lord Mayor. There is some good woodcock shooting at Lorette, and a very pretty waterfall, \u2014 the foam spreading itself over the rocks, so as to resemble the finest lacework. On looking up the course of the St. Law rence, from this very interesting village, a wide opening is discerned in the distant bank, once apparently the channel of the river, which at some time as is supposed, by a junction with the"], [447, "IN AMERICA. 151 mouth of the river St. Charles, made an island of the promontory on which Quebec now stands. The Canadian cottages are in general ex tremely neat, the windows, in particular, being remarkably clean; and occasionally a tall pole or flag staff, is placed in front of one of them, to indicate the residence of an officer of militia. Of the falls of Montmorenci, I will only re mark, that they are well worth the ride, or the walk, or the sail to them. The splendid view of Quebec, the river, and the surrounding country, that is enjoyed from the ground above them is a sufficient recompence ; and no stranger should leave Quebec without paying them a visit. The same may be said of the falls of the Chaudiere. They are in fact much finer than those of Mont morenci, and within riding distance. At Chateau Richer there is one of the best snipe grounds in the Canadas. In October they may be shot in extraordinary numbers, but should the sportsman be disappointed in finding"], [448, "152 six months his game, he may proceed to the falls of St. Anne, distant twelve miles. I mention this, supposing him to be a regular water-fall man. I had ceased to be so since I had seen Niagara. The different accounts I heard of Lake Charles prevented me from going there. Some told me it was full of cat-fish, and large frogs, which eat the little ones ; others called it a beautiful lake, and that good trout-fishing was to be had there. I certainly eat some small ones, which had been caught there, of a most delicious flavour. The attractions of Jaques Cartier, twenty seven miles from Quebec, were not to be so trifled with. This is the finest place for sal mon fishing in the Canadas, and a very pretty spot into the bargain. All is as it should be ; there is a small, but clean and comfortable country inn : the landlord throws a fly beauti fully ; his sister, a very pretty Canadian girl, waits at table ; and the mother broils the sal mon a merveille. The river, at all times a"], [449, "153 IN AMERICA. torrent, and now very much swollen by two whole days' rain, was rushing with the great est fury through the narrow channel it has worn for itself through the solid rock. The bridge, which is close to the inn, is a very neat government work. Under it is a hole, forty or fifty feet in depth; and when the river is low and clear, salmon may be seen lying there in great numbers. But the sea son was too far advanced, the weather too cold, and the river too high ; and my freind and I, seeing that we could not expect sport, returned, having killed but one salmon a-piece in the course of the afternoon. A fine open ledge of rocks extends along the side of the river, affording some excellent fishing sta tions. The place is named after Jaques Car tier, who first sailed up the St. Lawrence in 1535, and founded the city of Montreal. He is said to have wintered there, at the mouth of the river which bears his name. On his re-"], [450, "154 six months turn to France, he was of course coolly re ceived, as he brought no precious metals. He sailed a second time, with orders to establish a colony on the St. Lawrence, but having had the misfortune to quarrel with the Indians, he returned to his native country to die of a broken heart. The Canadian peasantry are of the middle size, or under it. Although they breathe some of the purest air in America, their countenances are worn, and unhealthy in appearance. They may be said to be smoke-dried, being seldom without a pipe in their mouths, and in winter they shut themselves up in their cottages, and breathe an atmosphere of tobacco fumes. I am not of course speaking of the athletic progeny of British settlers, when I affirm that a tall, fine hale-looking man is rarely to be met with. Nevertheless, the French Canadians are a brave, hardy, independent race, and happier, I should imagine, than any peasantry in the"], [451, "155 IN AMERICA. world. They pay no taxes, or just sufficient to keep the roads in repair. Most of them have small farms, and find a ready market for the produce ; and those who have no land of their own, can easily find employment with those that have. They never give away money, but are exceedingly hospitable in other respects ; and the poor Irish emigrant, who is travelling barefoot and pennyless to the place of his destination, is sure of a meal at any cottage where they have one to give. There still remains much of the French naivete in their character, and at a few miles from Quebec, they know and care as little about the pro ceedings of government, as the Irish peasant did, and does now, about Catholic emancipa tion. Without meaning to detract from the merit of their charity, it may be remarked, that there is something like a spirit of conci liation, if not of apprehension, mixed up with it, for they are afraid that the \" Bas de soie,\""], [452, "156 six months as they call the stockingless Irish, will finally drive them and their descendants from house and home. The population of Upper Canada, which I did not visit (my time being occupied in the unexpected voyage on the Great Lakes), is about 250,000. That of Lower Canada may be estimated at 500,000 ; but the amount in both provinces is rapidly increasing. Sixty thousand emigrants had landed at Quebec in 1831, before the river was frozen up, being more than double the number that arrived in 1830. Many of them brought out consider able sums of money. One morning, during my stay at Quebec, an old Scotchman, who had lived about fourteen years in the Canadas, re turned from Scotland with ninety of his coun trymen, whom he had persuaded to follow him : he himself bringing with him several thousand pounds, and the others possessing one, two,"], [453, "157 IN AMERICA. or three hundred pounds a-piece. Two thou sand of the emigrants that arrived in Upper Canada, were small farmers from the North of England. The soil of Upper Canada is as productive as any in the world, so that the emigrant has no occasion to pass into the United States, in order to obtain a better, unless he proceed to parti cular spots where he would be liable to catch a fever and ague, and where the excessive heats together with the moisture and richness of the soil, render it so hastily prolific, that it is often a matter of great uncertainty whether a crop will arrive at perfection. The strong natural preju dice in favour of the British flag; the fact that the British manufactures can be purchased after payment of a very trifling duty of two per cent., whereas they must have paid an average duty of 30 per cent., if coming vid the United States: that lands of equal fertility, and possessing equal advantages of situation, are sold at one half the"], [454, "158 SIX MONTHS price that is paid in the United States : that the climate of the Canadas is most decidedly the healthier of the two; are additional and sub- stantial inducements to a permanent residence in the British colonies. Good land in the best situations is sold by the Canada land company at from 10s. to 15s. the acre: their sales for the year 1831, having amounted to 100,000 acres at an average price of 10s. per acre. One-seventh of* the lands in every township in the United States is reserved for the payment of the clergy; and the agent for the clergy reserves, is authorized to sell 100,000 acres a year at 15s. an acre. The nature of uncleared land is known by the timber which grows upon it. Where a great variety of timber abounds, the soil is generally a black loam. A clayey soil is known by the great proportion of firs intermixed with other trees, but when they grow alone, it is found that sand usually predominates. This is also the ease where there are none but oaks and chestnut"], [455, "IN AMERICA. 159 trees. Potatoes and turnips succeed better than any other crop on newly cleared land. Both in the United States, and the Canadas, great quantities of sugar are made from the maple tree. The molasses are an excellent substitute for sweatmeats. In the month of March, a notch is cut in the tree, and a small pipe of wood is fastened into it, through which the sap runs into a wooden trough that is placed to receive it, and in this manner from five to seven pounds' weight of sugar may be obtained annually from one tree. The process of boiling and preparing the sugar takes place in the forest. The agents of the Canada Land Company, on the arrival of emigrants at Quebec or Montreal, for the season of 1832, undertake to convey them free of expense to York or the head of Lake Ontario, in the vicinity of the choicest lands, provided the emigrants pay a first instalment in London, Quebec, or Montreal, or two shillings an acre upon not less than one hundred acres :"], [456, "160 SIX MONTHS and the Company's agents in all parts of the Upper Province, will give such emigrants every information and assistance in their power. Should emigrants on their arrival at York not settle on the Company's lands, the money paid by them will be returned, deducting the actual expense of conveyance. At York there are large buildings expressly appropriated to the reception of emigrant families previously to their finding employment ; and both the government and the Canada Land Company have waggons drawn up on the wharfs, in order to convey them and their baggage from the place of landing. I cannot add any thing new to the particulars given in the printed papers relating to emigra tion, which are issued both by government and the Canada Land Company; to say nothing of the \" Wiltshire Letters,\" or the \"Hints to Emi grants,\" published at Quebec. These may all be purchased for a few pence, and the information they contain is, of course, derived from the best"], [457, "IN AMERICA. 161 sources. Their instructions and advice on the subject of imposition, which might be practised upon emigrants at their first arrival, will be found most useful. Wheat at the Canadas, according to the dis tance from the place of export, varies from 3*. to 5s. Gd. the bushel; beef (winter) 2^d. the pound, (summer) 3i*d. to 4rf. ; mutton in the winter is 2^d. the pound, in summer it is a little dearer ; potatoes are from 1*. to 2s. the bushel; a goose or a turkey may be purchased for 2s. or 2s. Gd., and a couple of fowls for Is. or Is. 6d. Ship carpenters can earn from 5s. to 7s. a-day ; la bourers 2s.

In Quebec and Montreal, excellent board and lodging may be obtained in the principal hotels and boarding-houses at 20s. to 30s. a-week. A labourer or mechanic would pa}- 7s. to 9s. Gd. VOL. II. M"], [458, "162 SIX MONTHS a-week, for which he will get tea or coffee, with meat for breakfast, a good dinner, and supper at night. An excellent private dwelling-house may be rented at from 100/. to 150Z. a-year un furnished; shops according to their situation at from 30Z. to 100Z. A farm of 100 acres with 20 or 30 acres clear, with a dwelling house, may be purchased in the Canadas for 150Z. to 300Z. according to the situation. There are, I believe, few persons who would not allow that emigration should be encouraged, at all events as a tem porary remedy, and the rage for building dis couraged, provided it can be done by just and legitimate means. The British government have an emigrant agent at Quebec ; it encourages emigration, and finds co-operation and assistance in the Canada Land Company and the Emi grant's Hospital at Quebec. Yet if the timber trade in the Canadas were suddenly destroyed by the measures which are said to be in con templation, the immediate consequence would"], [459, "IN AMERICA. 163 be, that the efforts of government in regard to one object would be neutralized by its own acts with reference to another. At present, there are from six hundred to eight hundred ships employed every summer in the timber trade. They sometimes carry out a cargo of coals, or salt, both paying a very insignificant freight (coals sell in Quebec at 26s. the chaldron) or more usually go out as it is termed in ballast, and thus afford facilities of emigration at an exceedingly cheap rate, to thousands whose absence from Great Britain is an ad vantage to both countries, as far as population is concerned; and who otherwise benefit the mother country by affording an additional market for her cotton and other manufactures, which they soon find the means of purchasing. In destroying the Canada timber trade by a sudden increase of duties, she is depriving herself of all these advantages. She would bring sudden ruin upon a numerous class of m 2"], [460, "164 SIX MONTHS individuals who have large capitals invested in saw mills, and other buildings connected with the trade ; she would deprive thousands of the means of buying and selling land ; a number of ships would be thrown out of employment ; emigration would be stopped, or at least greatly impeded for want of the facilities which are now given ; England would not gain in the affec tions of the Canadas ; she would lose a rapidly increasing market, and the benefit of a fine race of British peasantry, who would be ever ready to sight in defence of their newly adopted country. The timber is cut in the winter, before the sap rises. Suppose then that the new duties were imposed, that the trade had consequently ceased, and that next year a war, by which the Baltic would be closed, should break out about the month of March, no timber would have been cut and prepared in the Canadas, and there can be no doubt that Great Britain would be obliged"], [461, "IN AMERICA. 165 either to purchase inferior timber, cut in the summer, and prepared at a great additional expense, or remain without a supply of timber for sixteen months. It is said, and with truth, that clearing, for the sake of the timber only, rather impedes than assists the progress of culti vation, \u2014 a few trees only being selected on a given space, which are squared on the spot, while the lumber and branches are left to pre sent additional difficulty to the farmer by becom ing entangled in the underwood ; and it has been also remarked, that the annihilation of the trade would benefit the Canadas, by augmenting the capital and labour that is annually expended in agricultural purposes, and that\" the additional quantity of exported wheat, would soon make amends for their temporary loss : but it should also be considered, that the white -pine, which forms much the largest proportion of the timber exported from the Canadas, is in manyr places found on a rock)- and sandy soil, which is not"], [462, "166 SIX MONTHS available for the purposes of cultivation, and moreover that the quantity of wheat exported, is already increasing with the tide of emigration to an incalculable amount. In a mercantile and political view, it would be better that the Canada timber trade should not be interfered with ; but if any increase of the duties be resolved upon, it should certainly be gradual. One reason why the Canada timber is not so much liked as that which comes from the Baltic, is, that it is not so well squared and finished off for the market. In the first year, a gradual increase of duties might remedy this defect, by encouraging competition, while at the same time both the British government, and the Canadian capitalist, would be enabled to see their way more clearly. A great proportion of the lands in Lower Canada is divided into seignories, which were originally granted by the French crown, under the feudal tenure. No seignory has been created"], [463, "167 IN AMERICA. since the conquest in 1759 : but when crown lands have been disposed of, they have been granted in what is termed free and common soccage, and laid out like the old seignories, of which there are about two hundred, in a direction of N.N.W. by E.S.E., nearly at right angles with the banks of the St. Lawrence. The seignor then made grants or \" concessions\" to his under tenants, which by the old French custom were thirty acres in length, by three, fronting the river. This measurement, however, is now often departed from. The seignor re ceives from his tenants an annual rent of a very trifling amount, which is not redeemable : he is, also, entitled to a mutation fine, called \" lods et vents,\" being one-twelfth part of the money paid by the purchaser of land within the seig nory. The old French law compels the tenants to bring their wheat to be ground at the seignor's mill. This custom has been sometimes objected to, but no complaint can be reasonably made on"], [464, "168 SIX MONTHS the score of its being an injury to the farmer. It imposes no burden, because he can have his wheat ground at his own door, and if the seig nor's mill does not perform the work properly, he may take it to another. In the Canadas, the civil and criminal laws of England are in force generally, subject to pro- vincial alterations. The old French law, which was in existence previously to the year 1663, is still the law of property, with some exceptions, in Lower Canada. None of the laws enacted in France since that period, extended to the colony unless enregistered there. This is the reason why the ordinance of 1673, for the better regu- lation of trade, is not in force. The criminal laws of England were transplanted into the colonies, by 14 Geo. iii. c. 83, and, of course, none passed since that period can become law in the Canadas, unless they are particularly specified and in cluded in their provisions. Properly speaking, the Canadas have no commercial code. Great"], [465, "169 IN AMERICA. confusion sometimes arises respecting the deci sions according to the English custom of mer chants, and those made under the old French code, and actions at law are frequently settled according to what appears to be the principle of natural justice, rather than according to esta blished precedent. This surely conveys a re flection upon the wisdom of the provincial legislature; but the fact is, that the mercantile community is not sufficiently represented in the house of assembly for Lower Canada. Lower Canada is divided into three judicial districts \u2014 of Quebec, the Three Rivers, and Mon treal, the boundary line being drawn nearly at right angles with the St. Lawrence. There are but three courts of justice \u2014 the Court of Appeal, the King's Bench, and the Summary Court. The governor sometimes sits as president of the Court of Appeal; but the chair is more often filled by one of the chief justices. The court is formed by all the mem bers of the executive council."], [466, "170 SIX MONTHS The Court of King's Bench is divided into a superior and inferior court. The latter has jurisdiction only where the matter in dispute is of the value of ten pounds or under. There are a chief justice and three puisne judges at Que bec ; the same at Montreal, and a district judge at the Three Rivers. When the superior court is held at this latter place, it is held by one of the chief justices, two puisne judges, and the district judge. The summary courts have juris diction over property to the value of one hundred francs, and are held once a month before a commissioner appointed by the provincial govern ment, on petition from the country inhabitants. Quarter sessions are held regularly before three magistrates, with much the same power as in England, for the punishment of offences against the criminal law ; and petty civil cases may be disposed of daily by one or more magistrates. A magistrate is required to have property of the real actual value of 300/., and the oaths upon taking office are very strict."], [467, "171 IN AMERICA. A barrister may act as an attorney and soli citor at the same time, \u2014 which, as in the United States, appears to have originated in the impos sibility of making the profession pay, without such an arrangement. Pleadings may be written in either language, and English and Canadian French are spoken almost indiscriminately in the courts. I have observed great and unavoid able confusion in the inferior court of King's Bench \u2014 the judges, counsel, solicitors, clients, and witnesses all talking occasionally at the same time in either language, just as it may happen ; and in the midst of the uproar, the Stentorian voice of the officer of the court may be heard as he endeavours to restore tranquil lity by calling out Silence ! (English), Silence ! (French), in quick succession. But the pro ceedings in the superior court are conducted with all the decorum of an English court of jus tice; and the old jealous British lion, painted in the king's arms over the heads of the judges,"], [468, "172 SIX MONTHS frowns grimly upon the scene, with a pair of eyebrows sufficient to inspire even ermined dig nity itself with awe and veneration. Many of the powers belonging to a court of equity, are exercised by the court of King's Bench under the old French law. It grants injunctions by a process termed a sequestre. It takes care of the property of minors, and appoints curators of the persons and property of lunatics. The law of entail by a limitation, called a \" substitution ficlei commissaire,\" is well known in Lower Canada, but seldom acted upon. The attention of the legislature has of late been called to the state of the law of dower and mortgage, both of which are often productive of great confusion and actual injustice. Supposing there has been no renunciation of her dower by the marriage contract, the wife upon her mar riage is entitled to a dower of one-half of the estate of inheritance then in the possession of her husband ; and this dower is of itself an estate"], [469, "173 IN AMERICA. of inheritance which descends to her children, supposing they take nothing by the \" commu naute,\" an arrangement by which the wife is entitled to one-half of all property real and per sonal, acquired subsequently to the marriage. A communaute may exist with a settlement or without one, as in the case I have proposed. At the death of the wife in the life time of the husband or vice versa, the law permits the chil dren to elect \u2014 between one-half of the property in communaute to be enjoyed immediately, and the real estate which would have formed the dower of the wife had she survived her husband, which is not to be divided amongst them till after the death of the surviving parent. It sometimes happens that the husband and wife have joined in the sale of the estate, perhaps for the present benefit of the children, and with their knowledge. This sale, however, cannot deprive the children of their estate of inheritance in the dower after the decease of the wife, and"], [470, "174 SIX MONTHS although it is justly reckoned disgraceful for the children to claim the estate from a purchaser under such circumstances, yet it is sometimes done in cases where there was nothing left to be divided in communaute. A gentleman informed me that such an instance had occurred to himself. He had purchased an estate, and had been in possession about twenty years. It had been sold by the husband and wife upwards of forty years; but they were both still living, and he was much surprised one day at being informed by the children, that at the decease of their mother, they intended to come upon him for the amount of the dower, as there was no prospect of re ceiving any thing by the communaute. Till lately, under the then existing law of mortgage, a purchaser could seldom be sure of buying an unincumbered estate; a previous pos sessor in want of money might have been before a notary and have borrowed of a dozen different persons, on what is called a tacit mortgage. No"], [471, "IN AMERICA. 175 title deeds were required by the lender, but all the property of the borrower is liable for the amount borrowed; and claims of this kind were constantly made upon estates even after the pos sessor, who had taken all pains to clear them off, had reason to think himself secure in the enjoy ment of them. But by a bill that passed the legislature in 1828, newly purchased property is cleared against creditors who do not put in their claims within four months, the rights of widows and minors forming an exception. No writ can issue to secure the person of a debtor in the common gaol until all his property real and personal has been sold, the real property having been advertised in the Gazette for four months. At the expiration of that period, at tempts are sometimes made by a fraudulent debtor or his friends, to evade imprisonment by a pur chase in the debtor's name of real property to a trifling amount, which must be again advertised, and so on; although of course wherever the"], [472, "176 SIX MONTHS attempt to defraud can be made apparent, the courts of justice will interfere. In cases of a commercial nature where a judgment has been obtained, the debtor has the right of being en larged, upon giving security that he will not leave the limits of the city. In general, the Canadian farmers when old and unable to work, make over their property by a notarial writing to one of their sons, on condition of his paying a certain sum of money to his other children ; a custom which has the effect of preventing too great a division of real property. In the deed, which is rather curious, it is stipulated that the old man is to be sup- ported by his son ; that he is to receive from him a certain quantity of tea, sugar, and tobacco ; he is to be furnished if necessary with a horse to ride to chapel on Sundays and festivals ; and when dead a certain number of masses are to be said for his soul. The governor of Lower Canada is assisted by"], [473, "177 IN AMERICA. an executive council, composed of any persons whom he chooses to recommend to his majesty for appointment. The legislative council, of which the members are also appointed by the king for life, and the Lower House, or House of Assembly, consisting at present of eighty four members. The Chief Justice is the Speaker ; and the puisne judges of Quebec are members of the Legislative Council ; but it is in contemplation to procure an act of Parliament to remedy this unconstitutional ar rangement. Independently of the objection that could be urged against it as an abuse, the judges find ample employment for their time in their other avocations. They were placed there as a matter of course when the colony was in its infancy ; but the reasons have ceased as the colony has increased in wealth and population. The Legislative Council is composed of the principal officers of the pro vince, and other persons of consideration. Their VOL. II. N"], [474, "178 SIX MONTHS number is unlimited, but is usually about thirty. The members of the House of Assembly are elected in the same manner as the members of the House of Commons in England. Quebec and Montreal return four members each. There are but two boroughs ; William Henry or Sorel returning one member, and the \" Three Rivers\" returning two members. The other members are returned by counties, but no qualification whatever is required of any. This is an ad vantage in a young country, where society is comparatively small, and wealth is so often separated from talent. The qualification neces sary for a voter is real property to the annual value of forty shillings. In the towns the pay ment of ten pounds a-year rent is sufficient, and single women are allowed to vote. The sittings of the Legislative Council, and the House of Assembly, do not usually occupy more than ten weeks in the year, commencing about the middle of January."], [475, "IN AMERICA. 179 By far the larger proportion of the House of Assembly are of the radical persuasion. Like the rest of the old French Canadians, they have a strong negative attachment to the British government : because they are satisfied with the protection they enjoy, and are aware that they could not exist without it ; but their proceed ings evince little actual gratitude or affection for the mother country. Their grievances, whether they are those that really do exist, or those that are to be traced in the imaginary discontents of a few leading demagogues, being frequently discussed with more than constitu tional jealousy, and with more petulant vehe mence than is merited by the redressing and conciliatory spirit of the British government. And yet when we consider the events that are passing in Europe, it is not singular that such should be the conduct of a people, of whom it is said, that when a constitution was first talked of, they would have preferred that their n2"], [476, "180 SIX MONTHS country should have continued under the di rection of a governor and council, or rather under that of a governor alone. During the last session a bill passed the house of assembly, for an allowance to the members of 10s. a-day, beside their travelling expenses, but was rejected by the legislative council. Nevertheless when the Supply Bill came under consideration, the house of assem bly tacked on the desired amount for the pay ment of their members, and the bill in that state was most inconsistently consented to by the legislative council. Another instance of unconstitutional irregu larity may be mentioned. The 31st of Geo. iii., c. 31, declares who shall be qualified to sit as members of the assembly, but it creates no dis qualification to sit and vote in persons accept ing offices of trust and profit, after their election. By this act also, no bill reserved by the governor for the royal signature shall have any force or"], [477, "181 IN AMERICA. authority within either province, unless his majesty's assent thereto shall be signified within the space of two years from the day on which the bill shall have been presented for his ma jesty's assent by the governor. In the year 1830, after various proceedings in the same matter, a bill for the disqualification of persons accepting government offices, until re-elected, from sitting in the legislative assembly, was passed by both houses, and the governor thought it of sufficient importance to reserve it for the royal assent. Two years, as we have seen, is allowed for the signification of his majesty's pleasure, and if no answer is given in that time, the bill passes into a law forthwith. The bill was sent to England, and long before the time had expired, the im patient house of assembly entered a resolution on their journals, that any member accepting an office under government shall be considered as vacating his seat ipso facto, with the capability of being re-elected. As to the justice of the"], [478, "182 SIX MONTHS case, there can be no doubt; but when they themselves had commenced the application in a constitutional manner, their subsequent attempt to fly in the face of the prerogative does not reflect much credit on their loyalty. The net revenue of Lower Canada for the year 1830, was 128,345Z. 3s. 4\u201e., being an in crease of 5200Z. over the preceding year. The bulk of this sum is at the disposal of the pro vincial legislature ; and is expended in the coun try on internal improvements of every kind. The proposed civil list for the year 1831 amounted to 19,500/. ; but 14,000Z. of this is all that is asked of the province by the royal message, besides a reservation by virtue of the prerogative, of what are termed the casual and territorial re venues of the crown, such as the rents of the Jesuits' estates, rents of the king's posts, &c. &c, which, to use the words of the governor's mes sage, of the 23d of February, 1831, can operate in no degree as a tax upon the people, or tend"], [479, "183 IN AMERICA. either in their nature, or in the mode of their collection, to impede or impair the prosperity of the province. But nevertheless the committee of the house of assembly have resolved never to compromise what they call the natural and con stitutional right of watching over and controlling the receipt and expenditure of the whole revenue. Will they object when the remuneration of their clergy is thrown upon them, as is contemplated by the British government? It would be tedious, and far beyond the limits of this work, to enter into a detail of all the grievances complained of by the house of assembly; many of them have been, or are in the way of being, remedied, and they may be found in the report of the committee of the house of commons on the affairs of the Canadas, in 1827. They complain in their petition to parliament that the affairs of the province were growing worse under the existing government ; that the value of land was diminished ; that there"], [480, "184 SIX MONTHS was a waste of the public revenue; that the enactment of beneficial laws was rejected by one branch of the legislature composed of persons dependent on the government ; that the creditor of the government had not sufficient remedy; that sufficient security was not required of persons having the disposal of the public moneys ; that the independence of the judges was not sufficiently consulted; and they asked for the appointment of a resident agent for the colonies, in England, &c. &c. One of the schemes at present in agitation in the house of assembly is the entire dissolution of the legislative council ; a measure which that more loyal body do not exactly relish, and on the 31st of March, 1831, they passed a number of resolutions expressive of their loyalty, and respectfully setting forth their grievances at the same time. In the report of a special com mittee of the house of assembly appointed for taking into consideration the governor's message,"], [481, "185 IN AMERICA. in which his majesty, relying on the liberality and justice of the legislature of Lower Canada, invites them to consider the propriety of making some settled provision for such portion of the civil government of the province, as may upon examination appear to require an arrangement of a more permanent nature than those supplies which it belongs to the legislature to determine by annual votes ; it was resolved, that as infor mation relative to the expenditure of the sum demanded for casual expenses, and divers ser vices, and of the manner in which the rents of the Jesuits' estates, and the other casual and territorial revenues, are applied, was still refused by the British government ; they had therefore deemed it inexpedient to make \" aucune alloca tion permanente ulterieure pour les depenses du gouvernement ;\" \u2014 the legislative council, in their resolutions noticed above, having expressed a cordial disposition to concur with his majesty's government in making such an arrangement."], [482, "186 SIX MONTHS The Jesuits' estates, the convent, and the seminary, hold the city of Quebec in signory. The convent of the Jesuits is now converted into a barrack, and forms one side of the market-place in the upper town. By the way, I should recommend any traveller to visit the market-place in the lower town, where he will see some of the old French Canadians, with their long pig-tails tied up with eel-skins. The order of the Jesuits was suppressed at the conquest of the colony by the British. Government took possession of the estates be longing to them, and has since enjoyed the whole revenue, amounting to about 2500Z. per annum; and though frequently applied to by the provincial legislature, has thought fit to conceal the manner in which it has been employed. Amongst other expenses, those incurred in the building the episcopal church, were, it is said, \"defrayed from this source. Before I quitted Quebec, I was present at a ball, given by a lady and gentleman who had"], [483, "187 IN AMERICA. been united for the first time that clay fifty years, and were again married on that morning by a Catholic priest. I returned from Quebec to Montreal by the John Bull steam-boat, probably the largest river boat in the world. Montreal is consi derably larger than Quebec, and contains 50,000 inhabitants. Its front towards the river will be much improved by a fine quay which is now building. The principal objects are the convents and the new Catholic cathedral, a very large and handsome specimen of the simple gothic; but its internal decorations do not correspond with its majestic exterior. The view from the mountain of Montreal, nearly 700 feet high, is of the same kind, but I think inferior to the view from the ramparts of Quebec. The city is nearly two miles distant, and is seen to great advantage lying along the bank of the magnificent St Lawrence, whose"], [484, "188 SIX MONTHS broadly expanded waters can be followed by the eye for many a league, both above and below the city. On the opposite side, the country is one vast flat plain, from which the isolated mountain of Chambli, and another peak at a few miles distance, abruptly arise; and by relieving the monotony of the view, have the merit of giving it a decided tone and character, to which it would not otherwise be entitled. The horizon is formed by the bold outline of the distant mountains of Vermont, and those of the eastern part of the state of New York. I left Montreal to make an excursion up the Ottowa. The beauty of this river, the situation of Bytown, and the Rideau canal, were themes of admiration with every one who had seen them. I went on board a steam-boat at the village of La Chine, and in a few hours we were in sight of St. Ann's, and alongside the rapids, which we passed by means of a short"], [485, "IN AMERICA. 189 canal. About this spot the clear but dark coloured \"Ottowa tide\" is chequered by many a green isle, if they can be so called, when clothed, as I saw them, in the diversified and brilliant colours that characterise the foliage of the American forest during the autumn. Every variety of green can be discerned \u2014 from the darkness of the fir, to the silvery leaf of the poplar or the willow \u2014 while the unaccustomed eye is delighted by the bright yellow of the fading hickory, and the admirable finish which is given to the picture, by the broad patches of deep and actual crimson of the sumach and the soft maple. I must again repeat, that I have seen nothing of the kind that can equal the surpassing beauty of an American forest in \" the fall.\" It may with justice be compared to the brilliancy of a bed of tulips. We en tered the lake of the Two Mountains, so called from two lofty hills on the right. On the top of one of them, Mount Calvary, is a chapel"], [486, "190 SIX MONTHS built by the Jesuits, and connected with the Indian village on the margin of the lake by a line of chapels, placed at intervals in the pathway. Its sudden appearance in the bosom of the forest, is extremely effective and picturesque. Immedi ately behind the Indian village is a large bank of white sand, which in the distance may be easily taken for a well-cleared stubble field. At Ca rillon we were obliged to leave the steam boat, and proceed by land to the town of Grenville, along the side of the canal, cut for the purpose of avoiding the rapids of the \" Long Saut,\" which, when the river is swollen, are said to be exceedingly violent, even more so than those of the St. Lawrence. I found the banks on both sides of the river were cleared and cultivated to a degree that far exceeded my expectations, whilst the unfinished canal gives employment to several hundred poor emigrants, who were living chiefly in log-houses along the road-side, ranged amongst many other dwellings of a better description."], [487, "191 IN AMERICA. The Ottowa, although perceptibly inferior to the St. Lawrence in width and volume, is still one of the largest second-rate rivers in North America. Below Carillon, which is thirty-five miles from St. Ann's, I observed nothing except ing the foliage I have mentioned, that an ac quaintance with American scenery had not ren dered familiar ; but on approaching Grenville a lofty range of hills, containing rich mines of plumbago, ranges very majestically on the north bank of the river, which in many places is widened to a surface equalling that of a small lake, with its shores broken by majestic head lands. Soon afterwards, cultivation compara tively ceases, and the river bears a resemblance to the wilder part of the Ohio above Louisville, excepting that the forest trees on its banks and islands, are not so lofty as those of the latter river. Bytown is 65 miles from Grenville and 120 from Montreal. It is divided into an upper and"], [488, "192 SIX MONTHS lower town ; containing many excellent houses. Thirty years ago, there was scarcely an habita tion in the vicinity, excepting that of Philemon Wright, Esq., a Bostonian, and one of the best farmers in Canada, who with singular enterprise and sagacity, foresaw that at no very distant period it must become a place of importance, and as the Americans would say, \" located himself\" in the untouched forests of the Ottowa. A new world has sprung up around him, and he now predicts, with great appearance of truth, that Bytown will become the capital of the country : a glance at the map will shew the justice of his reasoning. The Ottowa or Grand river, runs through the country for about 500 miles above Bytown. In its course it is joined by several considerable streams, by means of which a water communication can be extended to Hudson's bay on the north ; and on the south it is connected with Lake Huron, which is not more than 100 miles distant, through the medium"], [489, "193 IN AMERICA. of Lake Nipisany ; and as the Saut de St. Marie, at the foot of Lake Superior, is said to be 800 miles nearer Montreal than to New York, it is highly probable that a considerable proportion of the product of the country around the great lakes, even from the further part of Lake Michigan, will find its way to the Ottowa. The pretty, unpretending fall of the Rideau, so called by the French from its resemblance to a white curtain, is seen on the left immediately before the boat rounds the headland that con ceals the locks of the celebrated Rideau canal, which are suddenly presented to the view, lying in a slope, between two lofty and precipitous banks, nearly perpendicular towards the river. That on the right is 160 feet in height, com posed of limestone. On the area of the top, which may be from 500 to 600 yards in circum ference, are the barracks and the hospital. It will probably be the site of an impregnable fortress, which might be built for 60,000Z. ; an VOL. ii. o"], [490, "194 SIX MONTHS expense which should not be spared, when it is considered that the splendid works on the canal, at present unfortified, might be destroyed in half-an-hour. The locks themselves, eight in number, are magnificent in every respect, and reflect the highest credit on the engineer, Colonel By. In length they occupy a space of 1260 feet, and from the surface of the river to the top of the bank there is a perpendicular rise of 84 feet. Each lock is 134 feet long, 33 wide, and 17 in depth. The canal, for several miles above Bytown, is supplied by the Rideau river, and before it reaches Kingston on Lake Ontario, a distance of 140 miles, a head of water is obtained by means of thirteen dams of different dimen sions, the largest being 300 feet wide and 65 deep. The navigation is continued by means of these dams, as there is not above seven or eight miles of excavation throughout the whole distance. On the supposition that military stores are to be sent from Montreal to supply the troops in"], [491, "IN AMERICA. 195 Upper Canada, or a fleet on Lake Ontario, it is intended that they should pass through the channel behind the island of Montreal, which is not yet rendered navigable ; that they should proceed up the Ottowa, ascending the rapids by means of the Grenville canal, and upon arriving at Bytown, be forwarded to Kingston along the Rideau, which thus affords a method of commu nication infinitely shorter than any land con veyance, \u2014 an additional advantage arising from its great distance from the American frontier, and proportionate security from hostile incursion. Although the Rideau canal is principally a mili tary work, it will be of the greatest importance in a commercial point of view, on account of its affording a direct means of conveyance by its communication with a number of smaller streams that intersect it at intervals, and which will en able the settlers who live many miles from the banks to forward the produce of their farms, with certainty and celerity. The difficulty and o2"], [492, "196 SIX MONTHS expense of conveyance was originally a great drawback upon the use of British manufactures in the Upper Province ; they paid a freight from Quebec of 5/. a ton ; but by means of the Rideau canal, the freight has been reduced one half. Land, according to its situation on different parts of the canal, was selling from two to five dollars the acre ; crown lands at a fixed price of 1/. the acre. On appbcation to any of the crown land agents, a ticket may be obtained, containing a permission to cut timber on a cer tain space of ground, on payment of a duty to government of one penny the foot. On the opposite side of the river stands the village of Hull. A winding road about a mile in length conducted me to the bridges thrown over the fall of the Ottowa, which according to the usual appellation bestowed by the French upon any fall of magnitude in the Canadas, is termed the \" Chaudiere,\" or \" boiler.\" The bed of the river is divided into five channels"], [493, "197 IN AMERICA. formed in the solid rock, with more or less of a fall in each of them. The largest may be about thirty feet in height, and from its greater violence has worn away the precipice for a considerable distance behind the others, which project and recede in a most singular manner, whilst the river not contented with so many ways of escape, rolls over the bare ledge of the rock that is ex tended between them, so that its eager waters are tumbling in all directions. The whole width of the stream immediately at the head of the fall, is more than half a mile. It was not particularly full when I saw it, but was darting through the bridges with extreme violence. In the spring, when the river is swollen by the melted ice and snow, the whole of the rocks are so deeply covered by the flood, that there is little or no fall to be seen even at the Chaudiere, as the principal fall is called ; and I coidd easily conceive that the rush of water at that season of the year must be tremendous. The whole scene was exceedingly"], [494, "198 SIX MONTHS curious; and although rather disappointed at first sight, I felt myself amply repaid for my excursion to Bytown. When it was first under stood that a bridge was to be thrown across from rock to rock, an old American who had known the river in its fury, and firmly believed that such a scheme was impracticable, was heard to predict with great emphasis, and corresponding action, that some day or other \" it would go right slit to immortal smash.\" Many of the poor Scotch emigrants answered to my inquiry as to their destination, that they were \" ganging to Perth;\" a thriving town, about fifty miles above Bytown, and situated between the Ottowa and the Rideau canal. Thirty miles on the river above Bytown, is the settlement on the Lake \" des Chats.\" On the evening of the fatal field of Culloden, the unfortunate Prince Charles Edward pre sented himself, wearied and alone, at the door of a hut, and requested sustenance and mo-"], [495, "199 IN AMERICA. mentary concealment ; the inmate, a poor tailor, who recognized his person, mounted guard at the door whilst his illustrious guest was sleeping within, on a pallet of heather. He was soon aroused by the tailor, who awakened him by exclaiming in Gaelic, \" My prince, core of my heart ! save yourself, for the enemy are upon you.\" A party of cavalry were galloping towards the hut, and the prince had just time to escape through a small back window, and reach the Morven mountains. For his greater comfort in repose he had deposited his sword upon a bench in a corner of the hut ; and in the precipitancy of his flight he had forgotten to take it with him. The tailor had just time to conceal it, by re moving the earth and burying it under the hea ther. The cavalry demanded the prince, saying that they had information that he had taken refuge in the hut, and carried off the tailor as their prisoner, who was afterwards confined in Edinburgh castle. In the mean time the sword"], [496, "200 SIX MONTHS still remained where he had buried it, but the hut became a heap of ruins. Whilst the \" Clan and Disarming Act\" (afterwards repealed by the exertions of the Duke of Montrose) was in force, he dare say nothing about the sword, but upon his death-bed in Breadalbane, the poor tailor informed his cousin, Finlay Me Nauton, where the sword was to be found. He searched and found it, in the spot where it had lain from 1745 to 1784. The belt and scabbard were rotted with moisture, and the blade of course nearly covered with rust. It is the real old Highland basket-hilted claymore. On the rust being removed, the burning heart of the Bruce sur mounted by the crown of Scotland became visible on the blade. Between them is engraved \" Le Chevalier.\" On the reverse are the words, \"Vive le Roi,\" extending the whole length of the blade. Finlay Me Nauton joined the veteran battalion, and died at Gibraltar, the sword being still in his possession. LTpon his death, it"], [497, "IN AMERICA. 201 passed with the rest of his effects into the hands of John Me Nauton, his brother, who is still alive at a very advanced age in Glengary, the oldest settlement in Upper Canada. Who would expect to hear that this sword, positively the most classical object in America, is now, as it were, lying in state on the banks of the Lake \" des Chats,\" in the wild forests of the Ottowa, not less than 150 miles from Montreal. Me Nab of Me Nab, the nephew and representative of the late laird, founded the settlement with the advice and under the auspices of his kinsman, the Earl of Dalhousie, the late governor of Lower Canada. He has collected around him about two hundred of his clan, whose forefathers followed his ancestors in the hour of battle, and have now gone with him in the day of their distress to clear and cultivate the wilderness of the Ottowa under his superintendence. He has possession of the sword, and never shows it to a stranger but in the presence of his piper, who"], [498, "202 SIX MONTHS is ordered to play the whole time. It was given to him by John Me Nauton, who added in / Gaelic, that \" some damned long-legged fellow of a Sassanach had asked him for the sword and offered him money for it, but that he would never disgrace the clan of Me Nauton by giving over that sword to an Englishman.\" The boundary line between Upper and Lower Canada leaves the St. Lawrence about 28 miles below Cornwall, and after running in nearly a straight direction, comes in contact with the Ottowa river at Point Fortune, opposite to Carillon. It pursues the course of the river for many a league beyond the habitations of civilised society; and then strikes off to Hud son's bay. During the last session, an Act was passed in the provincial Parliament for the ap pointment of Commissioners to ascertain its exact direction, in order to satisfy the borderers, who complained of being subjected to the laws of either province alternately. The idea of an"], [499, "IN AMERICA. 203 union of the two Canadas has apparently been dropped for the present. Perhaps the majority of the British inhabitants in both provinces would be in favour of such a project, or at all events would not offer much opposition to it; but the French population in Lower Canada would display a most violent aversion to any change of the kind. The old French law would of course be superseded by the laws of England subject to provincial alterations, and the French Canadian influence in the government would decline in proportion to the importance of the British interest in the House of Assembly, which would be increased by the accession of delegates from the Upper Province. Upper Canada would have no objection to a port of entry, by which her share of the duties on imports would be exactly regulated by the quantity she con sumed. Every ship trading to the Canadas must of course discharge her cargo either at Quebec or Montreal. By the arrangement,"], [500, "204 SIX MONTHS solicited and obtained by Upper Canada in 1822, no duties can be laid on goods imported or passing into Lower Canada without the consent of both provinces, or by the British parliament ; and the just proportion of the duties due to each province settled by arbitration, and its share paid over to the Upper Province. The propor tion it now receives by the existing regulation is 25 per cent. ; but this it will be seen must be increased, when it is considered that by far the greater number of the settlers resort to the Upper Province, that the French Canadian pea santry usually prefer the coarse cloth of their own manufacture, and that therefore the bulk of the imports from Great Britain must find their way to the northern shore of Lake Ontario. It is probable that much confusion would ensue for a length of time after an union should take place, and it is equally so, that the Canadas themselves would eventually be gainers by the measure ; but the more serious question is,"], [501, "IN AMERICA. 205 whether it is not better for the mother country to have two parties there, instead of one ; and whether it would be politic in Great Britain to promote an arrangement that would render the colonies far more independent than would be consistent with their allegiance to their mother country. As it is, the French Canadian interest is really on the decline, and the British popula tion is wonderfully increasing. Every thing considered, the Canadas are improving with a rapidity not surpassed by any country upon earth ; and I humbly conceive, that experi mental interference should be deprecated, be cause it would lead to a certain interruption of their present career of prosperity, for the sake of a distant and not certain advantage. I returned to Montreal. When a traveller approaches Montreal he naturally turns his eye to the mountain behind it, and feels surprised that there is no fortification by which a city of"], [502, "206 SIX MONTHS so much importance, and so near the American frontier could be commanded, \u2014 strictly speaking, a fort should be built on the top of the mountain, and at La Chine, and on Nun's island, by which, together with the batteries on St. Helen's island in the river, immediately opposite to the city, the passage of the St. Lawrence would be effec tually defended. But, when it is considered that the top of the hill, or mountain, is three miles from the city ; that it requires eleven pounds of powder to throw a tbirteen-ineh shell to the distance of one mile; that all the fortifications in the world would not preserve the Canadas to us, if the natives were against us; that the Ame ricans could never take Montreal so long as the Canadians would fight on our side ; that there is a prospect of a lasting peace between Great Britain and the United States; and finally, the probability that before another half century has passed away, the Canadas will cease, by a blood less negociation, to be a British colony \u2014 an"], [503, "IN AMERICA. 207 enormous expense may well be spared, by leaving the city in its present state. The picturesque island of St. Helen's, con tains a small garrison, and a large quantity of military stores. On the angle of the saluting battery on the south-west corner of the island, the French flag waved its last in the Canadas. I left Montreal, after having discovered that there was a pack of fox-hounds kept close by, and that they hunted regularly, and occasionally on by-days. They had not been long organised, but promised very well. I was also present for one day during the races. The course is two miles in length, and in excellent condition, being railed off the whole distance. I saw one race, which was admirably contested; but the ground was not well attended, and the others did not go off with spirit. I was told, however, that there was a great prospect of improvement, as the Canadians were beginning to be fond of the sport. The excitement would have been much"], [504, "208 SIX MONTHS greater if it had lasted but two days instead of four; and a public ball afterwards would not have been amiss. I then crossed the river in a steam-boat to La Prairie, distant nine miles from Montreal. A miserably bad road conducted me to Blair Findie, and subsequently to the very pretty village of Chamble, where orchards and corn fields were to be seen on all sides. Both these places, particularly the former, are well known to the Canadian sportsmen as the favourite haunt of the woodcock \u2014 perhaps the best in America, They are found in great numbers in the low birch woods around Blair Findie, where a good shot will sometimes kill above twenty couple in a morning, and I heard that in one instance as many as eighty couple were killed in two days by two guns. The beginning of October is the best season for shooting all kinds of game in the Canadas. The American woodcock is considerably"], [505, "IN AMERICA. 209 smaller than the European bird, seldom or very rarely exceeding eight ounces in weight, and its plumage is, I think, handsomer. The spots of brown on the back are larger and deeper, and the breast, instead of being marked with dusky bars, is of a fine almond colour. Their flavour is similar. The American bird when flushed, rises very rapidly, with a small shrill quickly repeated whistle, and seldom flies be yond a distance of one hundred yards. Sports men who do not mind the heat, will find the shooting exceedingly good in the month of July, when the woodcocks first return from their southern haunts for the purpose of breeding. In the northern States and the Canadas, they may be shot till the first fortnight in November has elapsed, after which they retreat to a warmer climate for the winter. No pheasant, partridge, or quail, is strictly speaking found in North America. The partridge, so called in the States, is the quail of the Canadas: but although on vol. n. v"], [506, "210 SIX MONTHS account of its size and general appearance it might easily be mistaken for the latter bird, it is in fact a species of the new genus, \" ortyx.\" The difference between the real quail and the ortyx of America, like that between the long and short-winged hawks, consists in the structure of the wing: in the one, the second feather is longest ; in the other, the fourth, which evidently unfits it for taking a long flight. The \" oxtyx virginianus \" has become naturalized in Suffolk, and has been shot near Uxbridge. A species of the genus coturnix, or real quail, has been found near the Straits of Magellan. The pheasant of the States is the partridge of the Canadas, and is in fact a very handsome species of grouse, feathered down to the toes, and having in a great measure the habits of the capercaily, living entirely in the woods, and treeing readily when put up by a small dog. I have before noticed the grouse, or barren, or prairie hen. In the Canadas there is also a darker coloured species,"], [507, "IN AMERICA. 211 called, the spruce partridge. A large grouse, nearly allied to the capercaily in size and colour, is found near the Rocky Mountains ; and al though five or six different kinds of grouse are to be found in North America \u2014 including, I believe, the ptarmigan \u2014 yet the black and red game of Scotland are not among them. A smaller species of red grouse is plentiful in Newfound land. The same animal is called a hare in the States, and a rabbit in the Canadas. It never burrows ; its usual colour is that of the European hare and rabbit mixed, and the meat is dark, like that of the European hare. A larger species which turns white in the winter, and is termed on that account, the varying hare, is more com- mon in the Canadas than in the States, but is no where plentiful. I would here remark that any traveller who brings his gun with him, and has a decided wish to see some American shooting, should bring his own dog with him; any that he i>2"], [508, "212 SIX MONTHS can depend on for general purposes, be it of what breed it may. America offers a fine field to the ornitholo gist, and even a traveller who is usually careless of the study of natural history, cannot fail to be delighted with the variety of beautiful birds which he will see in merely passing through the American forests, more particularly in those of the States. Red birds, blue birds, and yellow or Baltimore birds (a species of starling), will frequently fly across his path; turtle doves are constantly alighting in the road before him ; a large, magnificent species of woodpecker, with a red crest, usually termed the woodcock, will some times make his appearance ; a great variety of the same genus, particularly a small species with a marked plumage of black, white, and crimson, are almost always in sight; he will be startled and deceived by the mew of the catbird, \u2014 and his eye and ear will be attracted by the brilliant plumage of the blue jay, the singing of the"], [509, "IN AMERICA. 213 mocking-bird, the melodious flute-like whistle of the wood-thrush, or the instantaneous buz of the passing humming-bird. Considering the wildness of the country, I was very much sur prised at the scarcity of the larger birds of prey; a small brown vulture, commonly misnamed the turkey-buzzard, is however an exception. I never saw but one bald eagle in America: he was beating for his prey over the mountain of Montreal ; his snow-white head and tail being discernible at a great distance. They are more numerous on the sea coast, near the haunts of the fish-hawk (osprey). When this latter bird has taken a fish, the bald eagle who has been watching his movements from a neighbouring height, will commence a most furious attack upon him, will force him to drop his prey, and frequently seize it before it can disappear under water. The bald eagle is the national emblem of the United States.

The Catholic doctrine, divested of the pomp and absurdity of ceremony, being no where more strictly adhered to, than amongst the peasantry of Lower Canada. The houses are scattered around what is called the basin of Chambli \u2014 a lake about three miles in length and two in breadth, formed in the Richelieu river. A canal is now forming, which in a few years will con tribute very much to the prosperity and im portance of the village of Chambli and the sur rounding country. When finished, the course of navigation between lake Champlain and the St. Lawrence, at present impeded by the rapids at Chambli, will be safe from interruption ; so that the produce of \" the townships,\" as the"], [511, "215 IN AMERICA. lands granted by the crown are termed, will be conveyed directly to Quebec instead of passing through Montreal. An old fort built by the French is standing at the foot of the rapids. The situation is selected with their usual judgment, it being scarcely assailable from the water. Chambli has also barracks for 1000 horse, and 15,000 in fantry, but at present they are unoccupied. I would recommend every one who has time at his disposal, to ascend the Belleisle moun tain, distant eleven miles from Chambli. It is principally composed of granite, and rises abruptly from the plain to a height of more than 2000 feet. From the top may be seen the finest view in the Canadas. The eye roams on every side, over a vast extent of country, and the uniform direction of the \" concessions \" or lands held in signorie, contributes not a little to the singularity of the prospect.

The Riche lieu river appears to run at the foot of the mountain, and the whole of its course is visible from lake Champlain to the St. Lawrence. The mountain itself is exceedingly picturesque ; a small and very pretty lake being embosomed in its well-wooded recesses, like that of Tarni near Tivoli.

I proceeded to St. John's, and took the steam-boat for lake Champlain."], [513, "217 IN AMERICA. In a few hours we passed the old fort at Rouse's point, which by the late decision of the king of the Netherlands, on the boundary question, is now in possession of the Americans, although it stands on the Canadian side of the river. By the treaty of 1783, the boundary line between the United States and Lower Canada was im perfectly defined as extending \" from the north west angle of Nova Scotia (now New Bruns wick) to that angle which is formed by a line drawn due north from the source of the St. Croix river to the Highlands ; along the said Highlands which divide those rivers that empty themselves in the river St. Lawrence from those which fall into the Atlantic ocean.\" But as the land had never been surveyed, so that the position of these Highlands might be ascer tained, and it having always been disputed which were the rivers referred to, commissioners were appointed at the treaty of Ghent, to deter mine the true boundary, and as they could not"], [514, "218 SIX MONTHS agree, the king of the Netherlands was proposed as an arbitrator. Two lines were laid before him, on one of which he was to decide; one drawn by the Americans on the north of the Temisconata lake, and the other by the British 300 miles to the south of it. His majesty, how ever, in his award followed neither of them ; but has drawn a line between them to the river St. John, transferring to the United States about six millions of acres ; and has brought the most northerly point of the boundary for sixty miles within thirteen miles of the St Lawrence, whilst 200 miles below, it strikes off to the south-east after having approached within fifty miles of Quebec. The old French Canadian settlers on the St. John and Madawaska settlements, and who, like the rest of their countrymen, have a mortal antipathy to the Americans, are exceedingly annoyed at being thus transferred into the dominion of the States; but as both Great Britain and the United States are dis-"], [515, "219 IN AMERICA. satisfied with the decision, it is probable that some other arrangement will be made. We then passed the isle Aux Noix, the British naval establishment on lake Champlain, I observed several schooners on the stocks, re maining, like the ships at Kingston, as they were at the close of the war, and several old gun boats that appeared to have taken part in it. The expenses of the fort, which effectually commands the passage from the lake, are the same as those of a frigate ; and, as such, are placed on the naval establishment instead of the military. Upon entering the lake, the shores appeared extremely flat and uninteresting. We touched at Plattsburg, and passed over the scene of Me Donough's victory over our fleet in the last war. We then arrived at Burlington, and at nine o'clock the next morning I started to cross the New England, or Yankee States, on my way to Boston.

Whole fields were strewed with enormous pumpkins, and others were covered with broom corn, which is no bad substitute for oats.

General Gage had sent them to seize and destroy some stores which had been secretly collected at Concord. They succeeded in their attempt, but were sub sequently obliged to retreat. The fight took place at the north bridge, about three quarters of a mile from the bridge over which the road now passes. The inhabitants are proud, and justly proud, of this event. At Lexington, six miles nearer to Boston, stands a plain monument to the memory of the militia men who were fired upon and dispersed by the British troops on the same morning, pre viously to their advance upon Concord.

At an early day after my arrival, I took the opportunity of ascending the capitol, which stands on the most elevated corner of \" the Common.\" The Common, according to the usual English signification of the word, deserves a better name, as it is the prettiest promenade in the States. It contains about seventy-five acres, disposed in a sloping direction from north to south, varied by other eminences, of which the most conspicuous is formed by the not v/et quite levelled remains of the British fortifications of 1775. It is sur rounded by trees, and the best houses in Boston ; some of them being large and handsome, and not the less deserving of the epithet because they are of a stone colour, or any other than that of red brick. But at Boston generally I observed greater taste in this respect than in any other of the cities which I visited. On one"], [520, "224 SIX MONTHS side of the Common is a mall, or promenade, formed by parallel avenues of fine elm trees; but yet, notwithstanding the beauty of its situa tion, it is deserted by the Boston belles for the gay glitter of the fashionable shops in Cornhill or Washington street. To the best of my recollection, every capitol or state-house that I have seen, or of which I have seen a picture, is surmounted by a dome or cupola, \u2014 that of Boston is particularly con spicuous; but the smoothness of its exterior is but ill assorted with the richness of the Corinthian columns in the facade : it should be grooved like the dome of St. Paul's. The present heavy appearance of the cupola at Washington would be very much improved if it were altered in a similar manner. The capitol at Boston contains a very fine statue of Washington, by Chantrey. From the top is obtained a fine panoramic view of the whole city, with the bay, its islands, and their"], [521, "IN AMERICA. 225 fortifications ; its bridges, wharfs, and enormous warehouses. On the north is the memorable Bunker's Hill, with part of the fine obelisk that is to be ; the navy-yard, and the suburb of Charlestown. The bay of Boston, like that of New York, is fondly thought by some of the inhabitants of each city to be as fine, if not superior in beauty, to that of Naples ; \u2014 whether the}r have seen it or not, is of little consequence ; the bay of Boston, with its flat treeless islands and headlands, shall be as fine as the bay of Naples, and so may it remain ! The city resembles Baltimore more than any other in the Union : as a collection of build ings it is prettier, but I prefer the environs of the latter city, to the more distant hills that form the amphitheatre of Boston ; which is too large to add much effect to the landscape. Boston contains 70,000 inhabitants, and the first bridg-e and the first canal in the United States were constructed there. It appeared to vol. 11. o"], [522, "226 SIX MONTHS me the neatest city in the Union; and although there is no edifice particularly striking, yet there are many that are handsome, and there is an air of civic importance pervading every street in the place, so that the eye does not easily detect the absence of any object that is neces sary to complete the appearance of a place of such pretensions as Boston. The Fauneuil Hall, named after the founder, who lived a hundred years ago, must not be forgotten. It is the cradle of American liberty ; because, within its walls, were held and heard the consultations and the eloquence of those who more than fifty years back were first aroused to resentment and resistance by the obstinacy of the government of England. It contains an original full-length portrait of Washington in his regimentals, by Stewart. The figure is excellent, but the horse is very indifferently executed. The other orna ments in the hall, are emblematical of the pur poses to which it is applied. Public meetings"], [523, "IN AMERICA. 227 and dinners are held there, and the company usually leave behind them the decorations that have been mottoed for the occasion. The name of \" Skrzynecki \" was very conspicuous, among a multitude of others. Societies have always been in vogue among the young Bostonians. The objects of some of them are ridiculous enough. Many years ago a sum of 500/. was raised by subscription for the purpose of converting the Jews in England. At a much later period, a self-constituted college of young fellows sent a diploma to the Emperor of Russia; another gang, who called themselves \" the Peace Society,\" sent a deputation to the same august personage, requesting him to become a member. His answer was very gra cious, and was accompanied by a valuable dia mond ring. A Massachusett's farmer, hearing of this, immediately packed up and dispatched to him an enormous turnip (\" considerable vege table\") as a specimen of American agricultural o2"], [524, "228 SIX MONTHS produce. He received no diamond ring ; which was not a fair return, as it was quite reasonable to suppose that, as of yore, the head of a \" noble Swede\" would not be an unacceptable present to the Autocrat. A pair of colours, which ought to have been worked by the fair hands of the Boston belles, were lately forwarded to the Poles through the hands of General Lafayette ; and before I quitted the United States, a meeting favourable to the Poles was held at New Orleans, and \" an army in disguise,\" consisting of no less than twenty-nine volunteers, was waiting at New York in order to sail to their assistance. The delayr, I understood, had arisen on account of a dispute as to the place of embarkation, because, in case of their triumphant return, the city that last held them would be entitled to the whole honour of the expedition. I was present at a meeting in the Fauneuil Hall, held for the purpose of adopting resolu tions, and electing representatives to attend the"], [525, "IN AMERICA. 229 grand meeting on the Tariff question, which was held on the 26th of October, at New York. The literary institutions at Boston are very numerous, and the number of booksellers' shops is quite surprising. Upwards of 60,000 dollars are annually expended in public education, and perhaps an additional 150,000 may be the amount laid out in private establishments. There are fourteen infant schools in the city, and sixty primary schools affording the means of education to about 4000 children. The next in order are the grammar-schools and the Latin school, from which the boys are qualified to go to Cambridge (Harvard) university. Upon entering the infant schools, the first questions I chanced to hear were very national, characteristic, and amusing. \" When goods are brought into a country, what do you call it ? \u2014 Importing goods ! and when goods are taken out of a country, what do you call it? \u2014 Exporting goods !\" with a most joyous and tumultuous emphasis upon the distinguishing"], [526, "230 SIX MONTHS syllable of either answer. Cambridge, or Har vard University is about three miles from Boston, and situated within a large enclosure. The centre building, amongst several others detached, and standing apart, is of stone, and contains the lecture and dining rooms, and a library of 37,000 volumes, the best in America. I was shown nothing remarkable in it, excepting a valuable manuscript of the aphorisms of Hippo crates. I also saw the apartment containing the philosophical apparatus, and another in which there was a very good collection of minerals. I could not refrain from a hearty laugh at the contents of a paper which was wafered on the outer door of the library, and which I was malicious enough to copy whilst the librarian was absent in search of the keys. \" Missing, the first and second volumes of the catalogue of books in the library of Harvard university ! If the person who borrowed will return them im mediately to their place on the table, he will"], [527, "231 IN AMERICA. oblige all those who have occasion to consult them, and no questions will be asked.\" \u2014 (Signed by the Librarian). The whole annual expenses of an undergra duate do not amount to more than 250 dollars; for this he is boarded, and instructed by the lectures of different professors on every subject, from divinity to \"obstetrics\" and medical juris prudence. Christianity is respected and pro moted in its broadest sense, not according to the tenets of any particular sect: the professor of divinity being obliged to declare his belief in the Scriptures, as the only perfect rule of faith and manners, and to promise that he will explain and open them to his pupils with integrity and faithfulness, according to the best light that God shall give him, &c. Massachusetts is the only state of the L_ion in which a legislative jurisdiction is made for the support of religion. In every other, a person is at liberty to belong to any sect, or none if he"], [528, "232 SIX MONTHS pleases; but in this state the constitution com pels every citizen to be a member of some reli gious order, or pay for the support of some teacher of religion, although in making the choice it allows him to follow the bent of his own inclinations. With respect to the salaries of clergymen it may be mentioned, that in the large cities they vary from one to three thousand dollars, and from five hundred to a thousand in the more populous country parishes, exclusively of per quisites. Every clergyman is paid by his own congregation ; so that his engagement with them is a kind of contract. At Boston, I attended the Unitarian chapel, in order to hear the celebrated Dr. Channing, whose preaching was so popular during his resi dence in London a few years ago. His language was very fine, his accent purely English, and his manner more subdued than that of Ame rican preachers in general, who arc usually too"], [529, "233 IN AMERICA. oratorical to be impressive. I was fortunate in hearing an exposition of his doctrine. He con sidered Christianity as only a kindred light to nature and reason ; that the germs or seeds of the different excellences in the character of Christ were to be found in the bosom of every man, but that he alone possessed them in an eminent degree ; and that the doctrine of the atonement had its foundation in the fears of guilty mankind, &c. &c. The extraordinary eloquence of the preacher did not however make me a convert to his tenets ; yet it riveted my attention for more than an hour, and I came away with the impression that he was one of the very finest preachers I had ever heard ; although I was not shaken in the conviction, that where there is no settled form of prayer, the principal part of the service must necessarily be the sermon, and that the sermon, if it be at all worth hearing, instead of con taining religious admonition, is usually filled"], [530, "234 SIX MONTHS with a discussion on controverted points of doctrine. The medical college at Boston is a depart ment of Harvard university. There has been and still is, as in England, a difficulty in obtain ing subjects for dissection in the United States. It is remedied by different laws in different states : the more usual provision being, that the bodies of persons who die in almshouses, or by the hands of the executioner, or who are un known, shall be given up for that purpose. When at Boston, I was favoured with the sight of an admirable picture just finished by Mr. Alston ; the scene being taken from Mrs. Rad cliffe's novel of the Italian, where the assassin, who is obliged to commit murder at the instiga tion of the monk, is terrified by the fancied apparition of a bleeding hand. The monk, with a stronger intellect and more determined pur pose, is raising the lamp that he may be enabled to see more clearly into the darkness of the vault."], [531, "IN AMERICA. 235 A better flame and a more murky atmosphere were never painted. The outline of the figures is extremely good, and the terror in the coun tenance of the murderer is finely contrasted with the cool, stern, and incredulous gaze of the monk. Mr. Alston, who is the first, if not the only historical painter in America, has been employed for many years upon a very large picture, which is not to be seen by any one till finished. The subject is Belshazzar's Feast; and the figures are as large as Use. He intends to rest his reputation on the success of this painting, which will not see the light till he himself is perfectly satisfied with it. Many parts of it are said to have been repeatedly altered. On one occasion when it was threatened by fire, Mr. Alston re quested a particular friend to assist him in its removal, but made him walk with his back to wards the picture, that he might not catch a glimpse of it."], [532, "236 SIX MONTHS Lowell, the Manchester of America, is twenty-seven miles from Boston, and may be visited in the way from Burlington to Boston. Twelve years ago there was scarcely a house in the place ; and only eight years ago it formed part of a farming town, which was thought sin gularly unproductive, even in the midst of the sterile and rocky region with which it is sur rounded. At present it contains 8000 people, who are all more or less connected with the manufactories; and thirty-three large wheels, which are the movers of all the machinery in the place, are turned by means of canals sup plied by the prodigious water-power contained in the rapid stream of the Merrimack river. There is no steam-power there, and consequently little or no smoke is visible, and every thing wears the appearance of comfort and cleanliness. At present there are 50,000 cotton-spindles in operation at Lowell, besides a satinet and carpet manufactory. A good English carpet weaver"], [533, "237 IN AMERICA. who understands his business, may earn a dollar a-day; but the calico weaving is chiefly per formed by females, whose general neatness of appearance reflects the greatest credit upon themselves and their employers. No less than 40,000 additional spindles had been contracted for, and workmen were employed upon them in the large building called the machine-shop, which of itself is well worth the attention of the traveller. The vast buildings belonging to the Merrimack and Hamilton companies, are very conspicuous from the road by which the town is approached from Boston, particularly the latter, which are ranged along the side of the canal. As yet there is, I believe, no linen manufactory in the United States. Lowell contains the most extensive cotton-works ; but as a manufacturing town merely, its population and business are perhaps trebled at Pittsburg on the Ohio. The scenerv about Lowell is not deficient in interest"], [534, "238 SIX MONTHS and beauty, but it scarcely merits further de scription. The prices of provisions at Boston for the last two or three years have been as follows : the best beef has sold at eight or ten cents (nearly five-pence halfpenny) the pound; mutton from six to eight cents : venison from ten to twenty-five cents ; salmon from ten to twelve cents, and other fish from two to four cents. Butter from fourteen to sixteen cents; cheese fourteen and a half; coffee from thirteen to fourteen cents. Tea of course varies in price according to its quality ; the best tea in all the larger cities selling from about one dollar and a quarter to two dollars a pound. Before the East India Company entered into the Ca nada tea trade, the colonies were supplied from the United States. But now the course of smuggling, which from the nature of the country it is morally impossible to prevent, is decidedly"], [535, "239 IN AMERICA. in favour of the Canadas. The duties on tea in the United States have been reduced nearly fifty per cent, since the 31st of December, 1831 ; but still the duties in the Canadas are very much lower; the best gunpowder tea, for in stance, paying a duty of twenty-five cents, whilst in the Canadas it pays but four pence, and hyson tea paying a duty of eighteen cents in the United States, and but sixpence in the Canadas, &c. The Americans have petitioned for a fur ther reduction in the duties ; but it appears that none will be made as yet. If the American government would allow the tariff duties and the national debt to expire at the same time, it is not difficult to foresee, that as it is the amount of duties which governs the trade, the provinces would again be supplied from the United States, unless the British government should lower their duties also ; and then if this were to be done, and the United States and the Canadas were on the same footing, as the East"], [536, "240 SIX MONTHS India Company are supposed to purchase their teas as cheaply as they can be purchased, no fear need be entertained by the Canadas that any advantage will be gained over the British trade with regard to the expenses of importation. And in addition to this, the rapid means of com munication with the Upper Province, afforded by the Rideau canal, will, it is supposed, bid defiance to hurtful competition on the part of the Americans, when either the time or the cost of conveyance is considered. The course of the tea trade between the United States and the Canadas has been so much in favour of the British colonies, that the East India Company intend this year to send out four ships to Quebec and Halifax, instead of two as heretofore. Many of the old contraband traders have amassed large fortunes : the consumer, whether royalist or re publican, having been by no means averse to render assistance where it was obviously for his own benefit to do so."], [537, "IN AMERICA. 241 At Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, house rent is about fifteen per cent, cheaper than at New York, where the rent of a good house, situated, for instance, on a par with those in Gloucester-place in London, would amount to one thousand or one thousand two hundred dollars a year ; but counting-houses and other houses taken for their convenient situations with reference to commercial purposes, would rent in either of the largest cities just mentioned, at a higher rate than in London. The assessment or tax upon houses varies in the different cities, from five to eight dollars in the thousand. At Boston, the wages of an in-door male servant are from ten to eighteen dollars a month ; of females from one and a quarter to two dollars a week. The expense of keeping a horse at livery in either of the larger cities is about ten dollars a month ; but if groomed by a gentleman's own VOL. II. R"], [538, "242 SIX MONTHS servant it may be done for half that sum exclu sively of the groom's wages. Hay has been very abundant in Boston market for the last two or three years, and has sold at from ten to fifteen dollars the ton. Oats at forty-five to fifty cents the bushel, wholesale price. In Boston a carriage and a pair of horses, including the coachman's wages, &c, may be kept at an annual expense of three hundred and fifty dollars, about 80/. I shall ever feel grateful for the hospitable reception I met with at Boston. The society is excellent \u2014 the Bostonians more resembling the English than the inhabitants of any other city I had visited; and the bearing and appear ance of some of them being so aristocratical that they have much ado to keep one another in countenance. The governor of Massachusetts is entitled \" his excellency, \" and the lieutenant governor is addressed as \" your honour. \" The belles of Boston dress exceedingly well, better"], [539, "IN AMERICA. 243 perhaps than any others in the Union ; Philadel phia and Baltimore not excepted. At New York, as I have before remarked, the colours of their dresses are far too gaudy, and certainly ill-judged as to the manner and the time of wearing them. I believe that there is in England a very mistaken idea of American society ; as I have frequently been asked, what could not but appear to me the most unfair and absurd questions on this subject. With us the term \" yankee\" is generally one of ridicule, if not of disdain ; but to apply it in that sense to all the members of society in the United States, is far too indiscriminate to be just. There is, as I have before remarked, an aristocracy in every city in the Union ; and, perhaps, as many as four or five different sets or circles, notwith standing their boasted equality of condition. As far as I have been able to judge from what I have seen and heard, the American ladies are certainly not (generally speaking) what in Eng- a2"], [540, "244 SIX MONTHS land would be called accomplished \u2014 in music and drawing, for instance : and still fewer of them are entitled to the appellation of \"a blue;\" but if exceedingly pretty features, elegant dress and manners, and agreeable and sprightly con versation are to have the same weight with us in forming an opinion of the state of society in America, that we should allow to them if speak ing of society in England, I cannot but affirm that the refinement of first circles in the larger American cities is very far advanced, and much farther than it has credit for in England. Gentle men-, who are such from feeling, from habit, and from education, are to be met with in every part of the States ; men who are quite distinct from the tobacco-chewing, guessing, calkilating, fixing, locating, expecting, and expectorating yankee, whose very twang, even in the merriest moments, has something in it that is absolutely provoking to the ear of an Englishman, and in whose pre sence one is often tempted to exclaim, \" Be"], [541, "IN AMERICA. 245 their constitution what it may, for heaven's sake let us have something gentleman-like !\" I would here earnestly recommend every traveller in the States, never to leave any thing to be done by another which he can reasonably do for himself; and never to defer any arrange ment which had better be made over night, in the expectation that all will go smoothly in the morning, unless of course he have with him a confidential European servant. With ordi nary care there is not much fear of losing any thing by theft ; but the Yankees are often as careless of the property of others, as they are careful of their own. Above all things, let him, as \" Bob Short\" has it, \" be sure to keep his temper.\" Anger is of not the slightest use, and a man may as well be out of humour with his mantelpiece, as with a Yankee. Independence is visible in the countenance both of the English man and the American : but in the one, it is stamped as it should be on the forehead ; with"], [542, "246 SIX MONTHS the other, it is more often entwined in the curl of the nether lip. Never take the corner inside a coach on a rainy day, you '11 be wet to the skin : carefully avoid comparison between any thing that is American, and any thing that is European, particularly if it should be English. I have several times received a friendly caution from Americans themselves on this head. There are liberal minded men in the States who will talk like gentlemen on every subject; but I believe there is nothing unjust in the remark that jealousy of England and English arts, and English improvements, and English manufac tures, may be reasonably classed as the most prominent of their national failings,. \u2014 and that out of what may be designated as steam-boat acquaintance, there are not fifty men, from Maine to Louisiana, who can listen to such a comparison without biting their lips. I left Boston, as I did Baltimore with regret, and proceeded to Providence, the capital of"], [543, "IN AMERICA. 247 Rhode Island. In the way, I passed through Pawtucket, a very considerable manufacturing town on the banks of the Blackstone river. Providence contains nearly 20,000 inhabi tants, several manufactures, and some exceed ingly good private houses. In the neighbour hood, by the assistance of a friend, I procured some excellent woodcock shooting. Upon my return, I chanced to be standing with my gun in my hand near the bar of the inn, when a very decent looking American cooly removed a cigar from his mouth, and most civilly ad dressed me with, \" Well, stranger ! how do you prosper in gunning?\" At Providence I embarked for New York in the splendid steam-boat, the President, passing by Newport, a large and populous place, much resorted to on account of the sea breeze, which is said to be cool and refreshing during the greatest heats of summer. The Providence river is one of the finest harbours in the Northern"], [544, "248 SIX MONTHS States, and the best station for ships of war ; as a junction could be effected with a fleet from the Chesapeake in less than forty hours, with the same wind that would be adverse to a ship sail- ing from Boston harbour, and would perhaps prevent a junction in less than ten days : the next morning I found myself once more at New York \u2014 standing just where it did when I first left it ; and after the lapse of a day, I embarked in a steam-boat to proceed up the North or Hud- son's river. The extreme rapidity with which we were hurried through the water soon carried me into the midst of the most superb river scenery I had yet beheld in America. I con gratulate myself upon having deferred this ex cursion to the end of my tour instead of seeing it at first, and would recommend every traveller to do the same, because all that will be seen afterwards of the same description will probably lose by a comparison. The western bank soon presents a perpendicular of trap-rock, so denomi-"], [545, "IN AMERICA. 249 nated on account of its basaltic formations and general appearance, \" the palisades,\" continuing for nearly twenty miles along the river, and forming a natural wall or precipice, which varies from twenty feet to 500 feet in height, nor is the elevation sensibly diminished by the great width of the stream. On the east or opposite bank, at a distance of twenty-five miles from New York, my attention was excited by the beautiful situation of a small village embosomed in woods and still farther concealed by a pro jecting headland. Upon inquiry I found it was Tarrytown, where Major Andre was made pri soner, and its appearance immediately became doubly interesting. Whether he was or was not a spy, cannot, I think, be determined with out an answer to the inquiry, \" suppose he had succeeded ? \" \u2014 but whether the cause of freedom would have thriven the worse for the generous dismissal of a noble-minded enemy, or whether the memory of Washington would have de-"], [546, "250 SIX MONTHS scended to posterity the less untarnished in con sequence of such an action, are questions which are still less problematical. Major Andre was executed at Tappan, on the other side of the river, standing on the boundary line between the states of New York and New Jersey. The penitentiary at Sing Sing, is the next object of attraction; it is built by the convicts themselves, in the shape of a rectangle, 40 feet by 480. The system of solitary confinement adopted there, is the same as that of Auburn in the western part of the state of New York. The prisoners are confined separately, and are brought out to work together in the lime-stone quarries immediately adjoining the prison, but are never allowed to utter a syllable to each other. It would appear that under all circum stances this system is not more likely to prevent crime, than that which is pursued in Phila delphia; and on the other hand, with regard to the reformation of a prisoner in after life, I"], [547, "IN AMERICA. 251 should humbly conceive the latter mode to be preferable ; because as one prisoner is never seen by another, it is very clear he cannot be recog nized, but can commence a new life without risking a sneer from a former companion in con finement. I had lately enjoyed the agreeable society of two French gentlemen, who were travelling for the French government, with instructions to visit the different prisons in the United States in which the system of solitary confinement was adopted, with a view of ascertaining whether it was practicable in France. They informed me, that as far as they had seen, they were of opinion that the system could be adopted, were it not for the expense to be incurred in those alterations which would be necessary. A criminal con demned to imprisonment in France is turned in amongst a number of other persons, is fed during the period of his detention, and comes out of the prison just as he entered it."], [548, "252 SIX MONTHS We soon came in sight of Westpoint, at the commencement of \"the Highlands,\" and the most beautiful part of the river. This spot was selected in the year 1802, as the site of the military college of the United States. The buildings connected with the establishment are situated on a small plain, elevated about 160 feet above the surface of the river. The vener able ruins of Fort Portnam, are conspicuously perched upon an eminence 440 feet higher ; but the ascent is still continued behind them. The whole of the ground belongs to government, the immediate vicinity of the college being within the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States. The dress and appearance of the cadets is extremely neat ; consisting of a slightly braided jacket, and trowsers of grey cloth : their number is about two hundred and sixty. The academic staff is composed of thirty-three officers, and gentlemen who act as professors and assistant"], [549, "IN AMERICA. 253 professors. The cadets are instructed in almost every branch of science, but in no language, excepting French. They are publicly examined every year, in the presence of fifteen visiters, who are invited to attend, and have an allowance made them for their travelling expenses. Amongst other places, I visited the drawing academy, and another apartment, in which were several cadets studying fortification. When there, I could not avoid remarking that on one of the tables, by the side of the drawing utensils, lay a half de molished roll of tobacco. The disgusting habit of chewing tobacco is common in every part of America ; even the men in the upper classes are not entirely free from it : but it surely might be discontinued (by express prohibition, if neces sary) by the officers and cadets of the most gentlemanly establishment in the Union, and against which, laughable as it may appear, ob jections have been raised on account of the"], [550, "254 SIX MONTHS aristocratical ideas which the young men bring with them into society. The annual expenses of each cadet, do not exceed three hundred and fifty dollars. He is examined at the expiration of four years : if he does not pass, he is allowed another year of grace. There are usually on the average about a hundred candidates for admission on the list, and about thirty are annually accepted : a pre ference being given to the sons of \"revolutionary officers, or of those who served in the last war. Out of the whole number admitted, I was in formed that more than half of them leave the college from incapacity, disorderly behaviour, or other reasons, before their time has expired ; and that about one-fourth of them usually take their leave within a year after the commencement of their studies. Every cadet must have attained the age of fourteen before admittance, and is originally intended for the army; but in the"], [551, "255 IN AMERICA. event of his not getting a commission, the edu cation he has received, amidst the present and universal confusion of rail-roads and water powers, will ensure him three dollars a day for his services as a civil engineer. The cadets form on parade every day at one hour before sunset, and have a very soldier-like appearance, occasionally practising the guns at a target on the opposite side of the river. The band, towards the maintenance of which each cadet contributes twenty-five cents a month, is said to be the best in the States. If a young man does not distinguish himself, he will probably remain in the ranks of the cadet corps during the four years of his probation ; but if he display more than ordinary abilities, he may become a corporal after the first, and a sergeant after the second year ; and may subsequently get his commission as second lieutenant in the army. Kosciusko served in the American ranks during the war of Independence. His cenotaph"], [552, "256 SIX MONTHS is a very conspicuous object at Westpoint ; and at a picturesque spot which he is said to have frequented, and is known by the name of Kos ciusko's Garden : a small fountain, regarded at this time with peculiar reverence, bubbles up through a plain marble slab, and trickles over the letters of his name, as if it wept its all to his memory. Cannon are cast at the foundry on the east side of the river, nearly opposite to Westpoint. On that side also, a mile or two below, is the house which was occupied by Arnold when he was carrying on his traitorous correspondence with the British officers. The spot where he held his conference with Major Andre, is over shadowed by a small grove of trees, easily dis tinguished by their superior height. I under stood, at Westpoint, that General La Fayette during his visit in 1824, had said he was dining with Arnold, when he received from Major Andre the letter which informed him of his"], [553, "257 IN AMERICA. capture, and that Arnold immediately made some excuse for leaving the table, and escaped, as is well known, by running clown a very steep bank, and ordering some boatmen to row him to the British sloop of war which brought Major Andre, and was then lying in the river awaiting his return. The American musquet carries but eighteen balls to the pound. The charge of powder is also proportionably less. A general officer who served in the last war, informed me that having observed the shoulders of the British prisoners, he frequently found them black for a month after their capture ; and not being satisfied with the smallness of the charge of powder which had been already diminished by an order from the American head-quarters, he himself, then a colonel, went round to every man in his regi ment, previously to an engagement, to see that it was still further reduced according to his own VOL.

The men were thus convinced of the necessity of reserving their fire, and of taking a steady aim, so that, perhaps, one shot in ten took effect, instead of one in sixty ; the number usually allowed in European warfare. He also informed me, that during the obscurity of the night, and the confusion which took place at the battle of Lundy's-lane, he observed a regiment forming on his flank, and being unable to discern immediately whether they were British or Ame ricans, he jumped upon the top of a fence for a better view, and immediately became a mark for a volley of British musquetry, of which every shot passed over his head. This no doubt was partly caused by the old method of \" making ready;\" in consequence of which the musquet was frequently discharged before it was brought to the shoulder, from the perpendicular position in which it was held. The British troops suf fered more severely than they otherwise would have done on account of the colour of their"], [555, "IN AMERICA. 259 uniforms, the least portion of which so easily exposed them to the rifle of the back-woods man. Soon after quitting Westpoint we passed the town of Newburg, leaving the Catshill mountains on our left. I did not visit the hotel at the top of them, as the season was too far advanced, and everybody had left it. The view from it is said to be, and must be, magnificent. We then arrived at Albany, which has been for thirty years the capital of the state of New York; it is a handsome and thriving city, con taining about 20,000 inhabitants. Every traveller should contrive to be at Albany on Sunday morning, in order that he may proceed to Shaker's town, about eight miles distant, and attend the public worship of the sect. At Lebanon, in the same state, there is a larger estabushment, but it is more out of the way. Their mode of worship is certainly the s2"], [556, "260 SIX MONTHS most extraordinary that is adopted in any Chris tian community. About fifty men and fifty women were arranged en masse with their faces towards each other, and with an intervening space of about ten feet. The service commenced by an elder coming forward between them, and delivering a few words of exhortation. Several others followed his example at intervals during the service; one, more eloquent than the rest, who was descanting on the proper government of the passions and the abuse of talent, thought fit to illustrate his argument by a quotation from Gay's fable of \" The Grecian youth of talents rare.\" Hymns were then sung by them in their places, each of them shaking the whole time. They then performed a regular dance, holding hands, advancing and retiring, to a most up roarious tune, sung by a few of them formed in a small circle, who gave the words and the tune to the others as they afterwards paraded in pairs around the room, singing very loudly the whole"], [557, "IN AMERICA. 261 time \u2014 hopping heavily, first on one foot, then on the other \u2014 flapping their hands the whole time before them, with their elbows stuck into their sides, and looking for all the world like so many penguins in procession. It was not till the end of the service that they all fairly fell on their knees, and sung a hymn, as if they were asking pardon for their vagaries. I really think I had never seen such a curious collection of heads and features: the chin and lower part of the face were generally very small, giving to some an appearance that was perfectly idiotic, whilst others displayed a more subdued modification of that wildness of gaze which might have distinguished the fanatic companions of Balfour o' Burley: but there was scarcely one among them, either male or female, whose features were not remarkable on one account or other. From Albany I proceeded to Schenectady, in the rail-road carriage, which whirled me for-"], [558, "262 SIX MONTHS ward with a rapidity very little inferior to that with which I had been carried between Liver pool and Manchester, but by no means so silently or so smoothly, as the rattling was very loud. Thence I went to Utica, a town that at present contains 10,000 inhabitants, but intends at some future period to be the capital of the state of New York. Its pretensions are founded on its present prosperity, arising from the Erie canal, which passes through it in its way from Albany to lake Erie, its central situation, and the gra dual westward movement of the surplus popula tion of the more eastern cities. From Utica I visited the Trenton falls, fifteen miles distant. I was very much disap pointed : there was not much water in them, and they appeared more like artificial cascades than a natural cataract. The trout fishing in the West Canada creek, on which they are situated, is, I conceive, the best recommendation for a visit to the Trenton falls. Possibly Niagara had"], [559, "IN AMERICA. 263 spoiled me for every waterfall. It is, I think, the author of the \" Diary of an Invalid,\" who remarks that having seen St. Peter's, he should be contented with his parish church ever afterwards. I thence proceeded to Saratoga, the Chelten ham of America : but the company which throng to it from all parts of the Union, being its only attraction, and the season being over, I passed through it without stopping there more than an hour. The vicinity of Ballston Springs, which are near it, are much prettier. The waters of both are saline and chalybeate at the same time. The guide books are so filled with accounts of the marches, counter marches, successes, dis tresses, and final surrender of General Burgoyne, that I make no apology for merely remarking, that he surrendered to the American General Gates at Schuylersville in the county of Saratoga on the 17th of October, 1777. From Saratoga, I proceeded to Lake George, passing by Glen's falls, so admirably described in Mr. Cooper's"], [560, "264 SIX MONTHS novel of the Last of the Mohicans. Unfor tunately for me the steam-boat on the lake was laid up in ordinary, and I was obliged to content myself with a ride for a few miles along the banks. As far as I could judge, I thought the scenery equal to that of the finest of British lakes, generally, with the exception of Loch- Lomond. It is thirty-six miles long; but it has no where the majestic breadth of the famed Scottish lake. Its mountains are not so lofty as Ben Lomond, and it has not the weeping birch of the highlands of Scotland, or the arbutus of the lakes of Killarney; but it can boast of an unrivalled clearness of water, a most delicious perfume from the gum cistus (vulgo, sweet fern) which grows abundantly on its margin ; and the autumnal foliage reflected on its surface is cer tainly far more beautiful and brilliant than any thing of the kind that Great Britain can display. Cultivation was to be seen in many parts ; but there were no splendid country seats, and the"], [561, "265 IN AMERICA. majestic beauty of this lovely lake must be con tented to remain destitute of those unrivalled ornaments, so long as democracy holds sway over the mountains that surround it. At the head of the lake stands the village of Caldwell, and near it are the ruins of Fort George and Fort William. It would far exceed the limits of this work, were I to take notice of the numerous battles that have been fought dur ing the last eighty years in the vicinity of Lake George ; for an account of the massacre that took place after the surrender of Fort William- Henry, by Major Monroe, to the French troops under the command of the Marquis of Montcalm in 1757, I will again with pleasure refer you to the \" Last of the Mohicans.\" I should mention that there is excellent bass fishing in the lake, and that all necessary infor mation &c. may be obtained at the lake tavern at Caldwell. The bass is taken with a spinning minnow, and when hooked affords for a short"], [562, "266 SIX MONTHS time, even more sport than a salmon ; but is much sooner exhausted. Sandy Hill was my next destination. In my way, I passed over the ground where Gene ral Burgoyne surrendered, and in a few hours again entered a steam-boat, at Albany, with the intention of returning, for the last time, to New York. Before I went to America, I had no idea in how short a time a meal could be dispatched ; but to see \" bolting \" in perfection, it is neces sary to go on board an Albany steam-boat. The cabin is cleared as much as possible, the break fast is laid, and the free negro stewards are placed as guards at the top of the stair-case, to prevent any gentleman from walking in before the bell rings. As the hour draws near, con versation is gradually suspended, and the com pany look as if they were all thinking of the same subject. Groups of lank thin-jawed per sonages may be seen. \" progressing \" towards"], [563, "267 IN AMERICA. the door, and \" locating \" themselves around it, in expectation of the approaching rush, listening to the repeated assurances of the black stewards within, that no gentleman can by any possibility be admitted before the time. At length the bell rings, and the negro guards escape as they can ; if they are not brisk in their motions, they stand a chance of being sent headlong down stairs, or jammed in between the wall and the opened doors. In less than a quarter of a minute, 150 or 200 persons have seated themselves at table, and an excellent breakfast of tea, coffee, eggs, beefsteaks, hot rolls, corn cakes, salted mackerel, mush, molasses, &c. is demolished in an incredibly short space of time. The crowd then slowly re-ascends the staircase \u2014 and three-fourths of them are quite surprised that they should be afflicted with dyspepsia! The music which usually accompanied the feasts of the ancients, will never be revived by the Ame-"], [564, "268 SIX MONTHS ricans who are more likely to exclaim in the beautiful language of Euripides, 3licaioiK Be \\e<-ju>v, KOvSev tj oofpovs, Tous TrpooOe jBpojovs, ovk ilv afiiipTois, Omves vtivovs \u00a37rl fiev OaXiais, K7Ti t' etkaTTivais, ical jrapa henrvot-i fiiov 7ep7ri>as aicoas- iva 8 evb'enrvoi AatT\u00a3s_, a juaTrjp -relvovai pjoav To irapov e-jap e-^ei Teptyiv a0' aviov Aanos 7r\\'jpw/u.a j3poTO?aii>. Whilst I remained at New York, I employed my time in visiting the dock-yard, the race ground on Long Island, and other places which I had left unseen. The race-ground is inclosed with a high paling, and although well kept, is not on so large a scale as might be expected. The Americans believed that their horse,"], [565, "IN AMERICA. 269 Eclipse, was faster than his celebrated English ancestor, till a paper appeared in their Sporting Magazine, proving that had they run together, their horse, which is undoubtedly a very good one, particularly up hill, would have been thoroughly beaten. They have a mare, named, I believe, Arietta, which is said to be exceedingly fast for a mile, and is coming to England, to try her speed at Newmarket. The Americans boast that they are able to raise an army of cavalry at a moment's notice ; and they refer you to the backwoods, and tell you that a boy can ride almost as soon as he can walk. This is true enough of their riding to plough, or to church, or along the road ; but I do not remember to have seen a horse take a leap in the United States but once, \u2014 and he had no rider on his back. It is very rarely that an American is seen with a good seat on horse back. I should say, generally, that the Ame-"], [566, "270 SIX MONTHS ricans were bad riders, excepting the New- Yorkers, \u2014 and they are Americans. I think they are the worst I ever saw. They have neither a military seat nor a fox-hunting seat, nor a Turkish seat, nor even what Geoffrey Gambado would term \"the mistaken notion;\" but they ride up and down the Broadway with the toe almost invariably very much below the heel ; and the back and shoulders, like the \" genteel and agreeable\" of the same author, of course inclined forward : at the same time it must be confessed, that as they have neither cavalry nor fox-hunting, it is not surprising that they cannot ride. I witnessed an extraordinary exhibition, pur porting to be a burlesque upon the militia system, and got up with no inconsiderable share of humour. A person on horseback, masked, in the uniform of Napoleon, wearing a small figure of him on either shoulder, and carrying an enor-"], [567, "IN AMERICA. 271 mous tin sword, headed a band of ragamuffins, habited as their wit and ingenuity dictated to them. Pasteboard, pumpkins, spits, and hay bands, with a hundred other things of the same kind, being put in requisition to aid the spirit of buffoonery, and assist in ridiculing the militia. The only motto among the many that was good and pointed, was \" soldiers in peace, citizens in war.\" But the whole scene, although acted on a less serious occasion, was worthy the days of Anacharsis Klootz. I cannot forbear to relate an instance of that mock modesty of which the Americans are some times accused. I was at a ball, and was guilty of joining in a quadrille. When the time for the \" dos a dos\" arrived, I advanced to perform that part of the figure in the same manner as I should have done at a ball in England; but I found that the lady, who was dancing opposite to me, receded instead of coming forward, and"], [568, "272 SIX MONTHS my movement had attracted considerable atten tion. I felt that I had committed some error, and my partner, who had travelled a great deal in Europe and had often danced quadrilles in France and England, kindly hinted to me, with a slight archness of smile, that I had made a mistake. \u2014 \"We do not dance the dos a dos here ; we have left off that part of the figure !\" Two circumstances contributed to render my voyage home agreeable : one was, that I sailed in the splendid new ship the \" North America ;\" the other, that she was commanded by Captain Macy. As the steam-boat slowly towed us from the wharf, I felt gratified and grateful for the kindness I had met with in America ; and I un hesitatingly affirm, that if an Englishman be treated otherwise it must be his own fault. I looked at the retiring city : I thought the houses were not so very red, after all; and I tried to persuade myself that the bay of New York was"], [569, "273 IN AMERICA. as beautiful as the bay of Naples : but I found that I could not show my gratitude at the ex pense of what appeared to me to be the truth ; namely, that it is and must ever remain very far inferior. Partiality is apt to elicit some very contrary opinions. The New Yorkers think their bay equal in beauty to the bay of Naples : when the Dutch had possession of the country, they called it the New Netherlands. But these are trifles, and as such I hope they are par donable. I advise you to go to America: at this period there is no country equally interesting, nor one so likely to remain so, till it falls to pieces, pro bably within less than half a century, by its own weight. If you are an ultra-tory you will, per haps, receive a lesson that may reduce you to reason ; if you are a radical, and in your senses, as an Englishman and a gentleman, you are certain of changing your opinions before you VOL. 11. t"], [570, "274 SIX MONTHS return; and you may prepare yourself accord ingly. You will be gratified by visiting a land, that come what will, must ever remain a land of liberty, which the Saxon blood alone is capable of enjoying. So little, it may be remarked, do the French understand the term, that it is only since the last revolution that they have acquired the \" droit de 1' initiatif,\" or the right by which any member of the chamber of deputies can by himself bring in a bill or \" projet de loi,\" whenever he pleases ; a right which the mem bers of the house of commons in England may be said to have enjoyed for two centuries. Previously to the late changes in France, it was necessary that a number of members who wished to introduce any measure into the chamber should petition the king for leave to do so \u2022 otherwise, as is well known, it was brought for ward by the minister alone. You will be grati fied by seeing so much of what may be termed"], [571, "IN AMERICA. 275 the aristocracy of nature in the privm\u00e6val forests, the vast lakes and majestic rivers of North America ; and still more so by having visited a land where man is supposed to be more his own master than in any other civilised part of the world, and where his energy meets with co operation in the natural resources of the country, and commands success at the hands of his fellow men. You will then be able to form an opinion whether the state of society be more or less enviable than that to which you have been accustomed; whether the fine arts are more likely to flourish ; whether men in their public or private characters as husbands, as fathers, as brothers, as gentlemen, are better, more honest, or more amiable than among yourselves ; or whether the government under which they live is more calculated for the encouragement of true relieion, the shelter of virtue, the enjoyment of life and liberty; or, if fair allowance be made r2"], [572, "276 SIX MONTHS IN AMERICA. for the advantages incidental to a new country, whether it is better adapted for the advancement of national prosperity, than the institutions of your native land. \u2014 Go to America, canvass the pretensions of the Americans, and then judge for yourself.
