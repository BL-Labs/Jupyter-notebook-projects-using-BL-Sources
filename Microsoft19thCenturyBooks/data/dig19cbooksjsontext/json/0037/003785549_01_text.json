'\u25a0 tEW counties have received more affectionate and diligent i * [ attention at the hands of antiquarians than have Devon and Cornwall ; though it must be allowed that, in too many cases, a spirit of easy plagiarism has got the better of a nobler spirit of independent enterprise and original research. From this mild blame not the most eloquent is free, for the simple reason that, to the majority of students, the original records and registers of the Courts and Corporate Bodies were studiously forbidden or, indeed, unknown. A more generous habit has now prevailed, and in the 16th century we find material enough for volumes rather than chapters illustrative of official, social, and religious life in the West. It may, however, at starting, be at once premised that all ideas 01 uniformity in the spelling of Christian or local names must be at once resigned, and even the most familiar names mis-spelt. Early in 1505 a quarrel arose about the patronage of Camborne, which was said then to be worth ,\u00a340 a year, but few of the present day would recognise the family name of the Lord of St. Michael's Mount as St. Tabyn, who was patron of the said benefice \" by reason of a vowson gyven unto him by the hers of the Ld. Bassett.\" The tithe fight had been always a very troublesome business ; a stitch of wheat was worth 6d. at Ashbury in 1565, of rye 4d., and oates 3d. ; but if the tithe was sold to any unfortunate person who knew not that the living was sequestrated to Mr. Castell, unpleasant ness was likely to ensue. So also were troubles in store for anyone who denied his responsibility for tithes, if he worked the grist and tucking mills at Bideford in 1562, for John Paole had ground all manner of kind of corn in the one, and what numbers of kerseys no one could tell but himself in the other. Heavitree is the other end of the county, but here a quarrel was brought before the Bishop's Court about certain legacies which had not reached the hands of Alse Tottell, for this reason, as Johan Pyne declares, because she had never demanded them, though she, the respondent, \" was always contentyd to pay the valor of the legacies specifyed in her late husband's testament, although all the legacies mentioned in the sayde testament were spoyled and stolled during this respondent's lyffe time at the last commotion there was now in"], [14, "PREFACE. X Devonshere.\" The legacies consisted of a \" cow called Wandford ; XXs. for three sylver spooens. Xs. for a flock bed, and a bolster IIIIs., and a bed coverlet XXd.\" Curious expedients were resorted to at very early times to evade payment of tithes. At St. Kewe, one Trevethick, with a mind to cheat the lessees of the Rectory, carried off three acres of wheat by night, and when asked for an explanation laid the blame on certain (as he asserted) guilty parties who could not deny the charge, namely, his neighbour's swine. But the most fruitful source of fees and business to the Consistory were the actions for breach of promise which, while by no means devoid of the characteristic amenities introduced as evidence in similar cases in the 19th century, serve as invaluable illustrations of social manners and customs, as also as commentaries on the present Marriage Service in that obviously incongruous jumble of courtship and matrimony, and the present law of contract. The position of defendant and plaintiff were, however, in those days, generally reversed, the man being the injured party ; and this was the case in a very pleasant (at least in the commencement) ceremony, as we may believe, which took place at Tiverton in the days of good Queen Bess. John Ellys, of that celebrated town, having a mind to be con tracted in marriage with Joan Donne, of the same place, invited his friends Richard Southwoode, John Bydwell, Robert Shortridge, and Nicholas Ellys, \"with other men,\" to be at his betrothing with Joan, daughter of Phillip Donne. So they came together unto the said Phillip's house, and the matter being concluded what John Ellys should have in marriage with Joan, they were openly betrothed by Edward Prouse, junior, by words as followeth : \u2014 First, the said Joan did before the contract kneel down on her knees and ask (or in then, as now, more vulgar parlance \" axe \") her father and mother's blessing, which they gave her. Upon this the sayde Edward Prouse demanded the sayde John Ellys and Joan Donne whether that they were free from all other persons for any other former contract, and they both sayde \"ye.\" Then the sayde Edward Prouse joyned theyre hands togather and bade them to saye after hem : I, John, do take the Jane unto my wedded wyfe, for better, for worse, for rycher or for porer, yn sycknes and in helth, untyll death us departe, and thereunto I plight the my saythe and trothe, and so sondringe there hands, and joynynge them togather, the sayde Jone spake as followeth : I, Jone, do take the Ellys {sic!) unto my wedded husband, for better, for worse, for rycher and for poorer, yn sycknes and in helth, untyll dethe us departe, and thereunto I plight thee my saythe"], [15, "PREFACE. XI and trothe, and so kyst togather, and so every man that was present gave good handsell unto bothe the parties, and this contract was made in Phillip Donne's house and in his parler by the free consents of both the parties in a certayne Tuesdaye in the affternoone of the same daye in the monethe of Januarii was II eyres last paste. John Ellys was to have in marriage with Jane, with other things, which were concluded betwixt Phillip Donne (her father) and John Ellys. \" The banns were openly proclaimed in short space afterwards, and a day ' opynted ' for the marriage, and the gests bydden and certayne gefts were sett abrode whych were given unto them at theyre manage, and dyd putt them to fattynge against the day of marriage.\" Moreover, in token of the sayd contract Jone dyde fetche awaye unto her fathers house from John Ellys house his firste wyfes apparell. Also \"they are accompted as man and wyffe yn all the hole contrye.\" The Tithe question at Bradnich suggests another subject of almost equal importance and interest to both priest and people under the old system. Peter Sainthill was lessee of the Rectory tithes or glebe of Bradnich, and Thomas Warryn was a defaulter in payment of tithes. As so frequently happened, it was a matter of what was termed \" whitesole ;\" and one William Taylor, as an old parishoner, could testify that he had always paid \" lid, for the melche of a cowe and a tithe calfe, or else to agree for the same.\" He should have had the same pyce of ground unto justement when that Warrens eyre had byn expyred and ended yf that John Maudeat, the elder, had lyved, and the sayd Maudeat shewed him that Thomas Warren did paye VIIL\u00a3 by the eyre for yt, and the tithes of the same for III eyres is XLVIIIs. In this parish the tithe paid was always lid. for an acre of hay. For three years Warren had held a pyce of grounde called Brodcyce, payinge eyrely XXXVIs. VHId. So much for tithes and the troubles connected with them, even in those halcyon days of England's happiness under the good Virgin Queen. We shall see eventually how much fiercer and costlier the battle of the tithes was in 100 years time after those unnatural wars when the clergy returned in many instances to their old homes and churches. A more serious matter, as shewing the condition of superstitious idiocy and senile simplicity prevalent then (as indeed unhappily now) in the villages came before the Court, when the Bishop took action against Mistress Margaret Littlejohn, of Whimple, on the charge of incantation."], [16, "PREFACE. XII John ffyte, of Whimple, said, \" that betwyxt Mighilmas laste and Cristmas, he was presente in one Margarett Kellande's howse wydowe dwellynge within the parysshe of Whymple, and in the presence of one George Willes, alias Rewe, when sayde Marg.

John Byflye followed nonne; joynt to joynt, sinewe to sinewe, and bone to bone, and as gryne as grasse, an grasse ys yt nowe. In July, 1565, a similar charge was brought by the Court against Alse Martyn, of S. Mary Church. Hearsay was responsible for much of this mischievous and really dangerous stuff. Yet even Thomas Broucke, curate there, was ready to swear that he had heard \" Jane Sayer saye that Alse Martyn was a witche, and she wold Ryde over Halden tenne tymes.\" Even Edward Goodridge, who was fifty-four years old, knew her influence over kyne ; for he had advised Jane Sayer, who was \" in law with Alse, to agree with her, because he knew what harm she could do ; for once she came into the house where he was and called : \u2014 Gyve no melche ; and from that day they could make no butter, nor chysse, nor have no melche of kyne.\" Three years later, the Act V., Elizabeth Cap. 16, enacted that persons exercising witchcraft, conjuration, or enchantment, whereby any person shall be killed or destroyed, shall suffer as felons, with out benefit of clergy. The Bishop's Commissary, Mr. Williams, was occupied August 20th, 1560, in cross examination of John Welsh; who, if his own evidence may be believed, had been within a hair's breadth of indictment for this offence. Being demanded of his habitacion, he saythe that he dwellythe in a parishee called Metherbery in Dosett ; next, whether he were ever Sir Robert of Dreaton's man,\u2014 he was reteininge to hem by the space of VII yeres ; thirdly, whether he do practyse any fisike or surgerye ; he dothe practyse both for the Pisikes and the agues ; next, whether he dyd it by art, or naturally, or by any other secret or privy means ; herbes\u2014 whether hot or cold \u2014 he knew no thing of; as to a familiar, he answered utterly that he hath none aboute hem, neither in any other place of the world, ether above ground or"], [17, "PREFACE. XIII under ; as to whether any man is wicked : \" he knewe yt partlye by the feres, and that they be three kindes of ferishes \u2014 whit, grene, and blacke, which when he ys dysposyd to use he spekythe withe uppon hilles where is grete hepes of erthe ; namely, yn Dorsetshere, and betwene the houres of XII. and I. at nonne, at mydnyghte. He had had a great book of his master's, which had great circles in him, but this book had been stolen from him by Robert Baker, of Crokehone. But enough has been here quoted to show how, at the time of the Reformation, an immense number of country folk were utterly at the mercy of the most unscrupulous adventurers in every branch of the occult sciences. The old custom of Episcopal license being necessary for school masters, surgeons, midwives, no less than for clergy and other ecclesiastical officials of every grade, it is obvious that the wide extent of jurisdiction which formerly belonged to the Court of the Bishop was incompatible with the exercise of that special discipline which is now thought to be only necessary for the clergy. One result, however, is obtained, for which those who desire to know the real facts of social and religious life in any particular diocese must be thankful, that is the possession of actual original contemporary records which are beyond dispute. The system of verbatim reports was as accurately carried out as at the present time. Incidents of daily life, with all their quaint force, stand straight before us, and so we are able to appreciate the immense advantages which have been obtained by the persistent efforts of the Church, both before and since the Reformation, to teach and train the people, and eradicate superstition and ignorance. Moral offences we can more readily understand as being cognizable under the then extensive system of Episcopal supervision ; but the intricate matter of tithing fishes caught some thousands of miles from the shores of Brixham Bay, is sans doute an extreme case. These facts however have a very definite bearing upon Church history, specially in a diocese where an isosceles triangle best repre sents its geographical shape, the base representing the only part which is not seaboard, because it is obvious that such conditions must not only have primarily affected the history of the inhabitants (as it is well known was the case from very early times), but also the prosperity of the Church and the relations of parson and people. For example in a sea-port or fishing town of which there are many more than manufacturing in the counties of Devon and Cornwall, the income of the Church was like the population, necessarily precarious and uncertain. Of this we have ample proof, not only in medi\u00e6val, but in modern tales."], [18, "PREFACE. XIV We know that Walter Raleigh \u2014 very possibly father of Sir Walter \u2014 farmed the fish at Sidmouth. All along the coasts from Beer to Sennen the Vicar looked to the farmer of the Vicarage or Glebe, and must needs have an eye to his dues. At Maker and St. Germans the dispute waxed exceeding hot in the latter years of the 16th century, and to shew how continuous and unbroken the trade and commercial interests of our seaboard ports is, we will give an instance found circumstantially reported as long ago as 1565, in the words of Richard Skerden, who lived at Gampton or Yealmpton, and was well acquainted with both the places and parties concerned. This was his account of the customs of fish tithing in South Devon. \" Mr. Collyns and John Rowse, the yonger, havynge a ship which traveled unto the new founde lande a ffyshinge in A.D. 1563, the marryners of the sayde ship dyd paye tethinge ffyshe of there shares when they came home unto Mr. Doctor Gammon, Vicar of Brixham, viz. : XIX cople of drye flyshes and VI cople of corse ffshes, and the drye was worth XVs. a hundred, and the corse was worth XXXIIIs. a hundred, and some of it XXXIIIIs. the hundred ; farther, he saythe that every man had for his share VII dry ffyshes and II and a halse corse ffyshes after VI score the hundred.\" We read, however, that Prouse, senior, was a recusant \u2014 at least, as far as paying tithes went, not in so hazardous or precarious a matter as fishes in Newfoundland, but as to the tenth of wheat and barley, actually and confessedly grown and cut in the parish of Brixham at Churston. The customs of tithing whitesole in Cornwall are not less interesting, as illustrating the relations of clergy to their parishoners, and the lamentable differences which invariably and continuously arose as to the value and quantity of stock existing at any particular time on any particular farm in that particular parish. Mr. Frank Courtenay farmed the Vicarage of St. Vepe in 1566, and went to the Consistorial to get his dues enforced. There lived Richard Davye, a \" workeman,\" 79 years old ; his idea of the custom of the parish was this : All and singular the inhabytants havynge, within the parish of St. Vepe, or the lymets and tething places of the same kye, feding and pasturing and lyeing, whiche do bringe forthe calves to the numbre of VII in one yere (begynnge alwayes at Ester), shall paye unto the Vicar one calfe for tethe, and shal be allowed for the tethe of III calves yn the yere then next followinge ; and all other persons of the same parishe, having a lesse numbre of kye than seven kye, bringing yn one yere lesse numbre of calves than VII, shall pay in redy money one helf peny if they reare hem, and yf they kill hem or selle hem, one penye. As also all and singular, having within the saide paryshe kye that be melche kye unto the numbre of VII,"], [19, "PREFACE. XV shall paye tethe butter and chyse, and having a lesse numbre of kye than VII, shalle paye in redy money one pennye for every cow, and no more, at Ester. Same said John Griffin had paid \" of friendship unto the Vicars butter and chyse under the numbre of VII.\" To these, and similar depositions, the notaries public generally put their accustomed marks, which varied from a simple but usually more elaborate cross to a conventional trellis work sort of design, calculated to serve either as a labyrinth for a schoolboy or, as in one remarkable instance, as a sort of ground plan for a fortress. The mottoes ingeniously scribbled beneath these ambitious devices were of this descriptive character \u2014 Diligite justiciam : qui judicastis ten am or, Magna est veritas. If the high tone of morality evinced in these epigrammatic subscriptions to the official Acts of the Court did not permeate the remote hamlets of Brampford, Stoodleigh, and Molland, we cannot be surprised ; but we certainly pick up a vast amount of indirect information as to parochial life, and the actual places and points of local interest in the country parishes of the diocese. When, as under the old system of compulsory celibacy the character of the country parson was absolutely at the mercy of all his parishoners, some of whom almost as a certainty were simply but securely prejudiced against him as the recipient of their tithes, it does not seem that the clergy at the time of the Reformation, or for many antecedent years, had in any sense merited the obloquy which historians have thought fit to pour recklessly upon them as a class. Documentary evidence, which unfortunately many such biassed writers never took pains to consult, does not corroborate the loathsome picture painted of the English clergy in the 16th century, at least, down west. In one department we can give proof indis putable of the feelings of goodwill which existed between the country priest and his flock. Where he lived he died ; and when he looked round on his glebe, and his stock of quick and dead, it occurred to him that outside his own parish there was no one so closely con nected with himself, and the altar at which he had so many years celebrated the divine mysteries, as the yeoman and labourers around him. He had stood godfather to their little ones, and nursed them on his own knee ; he had sent them forth to fight by sea and land ; some he had laid beneath the sod in peace, but yet a few remained. To these, lacking his own kith and kin, should his own goods and chattels go."], [20, "PREFACE. XVI Touching is the minute and detailed care with which many a diligent pastor bequeathed his little personal possessions to his people. In many villages all the ancient amusements, no less than acts and habits of devotion, concentrated round the parish church, so that it is not surprising to hear how, on divers occasions, conduct and language which would the other side of the cemetery wall have been extremely culpable and, indeed, sacrilegious, simply was accounted libel. Brampford, about four miles from Exeter, is a pretty village on the banks of the Exe. In the year 1541, on a certain evening about Michaelmas, the village of Brampford Speke was slightly disturbed by the disorderly language which passed between William Pridham and Alice Palmer. It appear that Elizabeth Knowling, with Thomas Pansfsord and a dozen others, were in \" a certain sportynge place fast by the church yarde,\" when William said to the plaintiff, as they stood in the churchyard, \" How sayst that thow did see my wiff go into the vicarage at IX. of the clocke at nyght, and came nott owte agen that nygght?\" To which Alice said, \" I beseche God, the devyle take me if ever I spoke hit or thought hit, and thow lyest appon me lyke a dronken knave.\" Such words led, as may well be imagined, to an exchange of further civilities, but not in the churchyard, as, on the approach of a storm, the offended and offending parties moved unto a more suitable site. Here Pridham used a word to Alice, which was seriously calculated to injure her reputation, of which the parishioners were supremely jealous. This solitary example will suffice to illustrate the evils which indiscriminate access to the Ecclesiastical Courts allowed, if it did not actually encourage. The following data are verbatim reports from original documents of indisputable authority. They illustrate with unusual freshness the life of the parish and the Church of England, in times remarkable in our National and Ecclesiastical History. Richard Peres de Sythney, Diocese of Exon, husbandman, forty years of age or thereabouts, freeman, a witness on behalf of Sir Barnabas Johns, Clerk produced, sworn and examined spake as follows : \u2014 That XVI. yeres past or there about, as this examinate remem breth the tyme, he comyng unto Sir William Goodolphin's Knight, then living at his house of Goodolphin, in the parrishe of Breage and County of Cornewall, for certen speciall busynes and earnest affayres of his owne, went into the parlour of the said Sir William. Where this deponent sawe the L. Byshop, of Exeter, viz., Mr. Alley* * William Alley was Bishop of Exeter, 1560-1570."], [21, "PREFACE. XVII reading one booke unto his kinnesman, Sir Barnard Johns, now vicar of St. Issye, then and there beynge present at that time the said Sir William Goodolphin, Mr. Retyn, Esquier, Hugh Bearde, servaunt unto the said Sir William, and one Mr. Sellack, then vycar or curate of Constantyne ; and after reverences and duty done by this examinate, he stayed in the parlour during the whole tyme that the said L. Bishop was reading unto the same Sir Barnard, and in the time of his reading this deponent saythe he saw the sayd Mr. Barnabas kneel downe on his knees, and the Bishop to lay his hands on his hed, repeating certen wordes, but what they be he likewise remembreth not ; at the sight whereof then this deponent wascertenly persuaded that the said Bishop dyd make his sayd kinnesman deacon. This statement was followed by that of John Trekeare, clerk, curate of Bereferrers, 35 years old or thereabouts: \u2014 XVI. yeres passed ore theare abouts {non recolit tempus, i.e., he cannot recollect exact time) this deponent came out of Cornwall accompanied with the foresaid Sir Bernard John, and one Bysse, then Mr. Tussar's man, who was sent with this deponent unto the Lord Bishop Alley from his said Mr. with letters in this deponent's commendacion to be ordered deacon ; duryng which theire journeying, the said Sir Barnard told this examinate that his busyness was also unto the said Lord Bishop, to be ordered full minister ; and when they were come unto Exeter, both this deponent and the said Sir Barnard were apposed by the said Lord Bishop in one verse out of some Latten author, and ymmediatlye this deponent, with other then present to be ordered, was ordered by the said Lord Bishop deacon ; and verely he thinketh and belevth in his conscyense that the said Sir Barnard John was at that present tyme ordered full minister also, but precisly he will not depose the thing being so long sythens past. It is clear from this glimpse of Church feeling in Cornwall that a \" Nagshead \" sort of legend was the readiest weapon the adherents of Roman allegiance could get hold of. Bishop Alley was intensely unpopular ; the most extravagant and wretched tales were invented by the unscrupulous as to his health and habits, to which it was even asserted in open Court (Consistorial) that his wife was a condoning party. If any parish priest was at variance with any of his people on the question of tithes, there was no lack of opportunity on the one side or the other of exposing their parson's peccadilloes. Happily, all the cases that came before the Consistorial Court were not to the detriment or prejudice of the clergy or Church of those days. Parson-baiting was not the only sport. British national feeling ran high, and the hatred of a foreigner \u2014 especially of one with anything"], [22, "PREFACE. XVIII like Spanish blood in his veins \u2014 was enough to put a whole village or town in an uproar. This was especially the case in the later decades of the 16th century. Amongst maritime towns then of first importance, the old parish of Toppesham, alias Topsham, held a conspicuous place, on the banks of the Exe, some eight miles from Exmouth. The following tale gives an insight into popular feeling at all seaside towns and maritime ports at this period, when the scent of a man who spoke the \" Portyngall or Castiglione tongue \" would have set all the men, as well as the \" wiffs of Topsham,\" on the hue and cry for a month. It is difficult to see how such an absurd fracas came within the cognizance of the Bishop's Consistory, as in these days it would have been taken at the Petty Sessions held at Woodbury, the manor formerly the Peculiar of the Vicars Choral of Exeter Cathedral ; but we must remember that all such cases, until comparatively recent times, came within the reach of the Arm Ecclesiastical, and that it was, thanks to the somewhat aggressive and officious diplomatic self assertion of the Registrars, Surrogates, Notaries Public, and other innumerable functionaries connected with the old Episcopal and Archidiaconal Jurisdictions, that we now are able to gain some notion of life and manners in the days of Bluff Harry, and his less beloved daughter Mary the Queen. Alfred Frost was not a native of Topsham, but he was of the mature age of a score of years, and had lived in that then busy moving sea-port four years ; he was a freeman \u2014 no serf \u2014 possibly a sailor ; he had known White and Rogers, the plaintiffs, ever since he had been there ; and he knew Consalvos, the defendant, too, very well, About three weeks ago, he was going along the public road in Topsham, and as he passed the door of William Ford's house he heard Consalvos calling White and Rogers two very uncomplimentary names, the latter being \"dronkerds in the englishe tonge, and in the portyngale tange this deponent hard Consalvos call the said White and Roger Carnotkous, presente ibidem et audiente dicto yosepho Spanyard.\" Asked, qua occasione, for what reason the said Consalvos used these expressions, he declared \" the sayd White said unto Roger, give this Portyngale a blow, and I will give thee a pynte of wyne \u25a0 and so the said Roger did give him a blow or twayne cum gladio evaginato; and for that both Whit and Roger wer sett in the stocks.\" He knew it, because he saw them therein, but he had nothing to do with the blows, on his oath ; he only saw them \" in ley stocks.\""], [23, "PREFACE. XIX They themselfyes shewed this deponent that they were sett in the stocks for gyven the portyngale consalvos a blow, and upon the next morrow the portyngayle mett Rogers and Whyte, and called them as this deponent hath deposed. And he saythe that the good fame of the sayd Whyte and Rogers is hurt by these words, and that they love there wiffs the worse for the same words, and there wiffs do wepe and morn for hit.\" (Goodness gracious \u2014 here, if ever, is a plea for damages.) He saythe likewise that there is a public report about that Consalvos has defamed them, \" callynge them Carnethoues, which is in englishe Cuckold, for this deponent doth understand and can speake the langage well, as he sayth.\" Cross-examined as to how he knows this public report is about, he saith \" that the wiffs of Topsham thought to have betten the said portyngale, and the cause had nott bene in the lawe.\" Unfortunately, the case was not carried through the Court ; perhaps Alfred Frost's evidence was too much for the Vicar-General. Anyhow, \"Johannes Spanyarte de Moorlesse Frigare \" did not throw much light on the occurrence, but Messrs. Whyte and Rogers may have got off cheap, as it is very noticeable in the rough copy of the depositions that where the sword with which these lively gentlemen smote their friend Consalvos is mentioned, the notary has \u2014 evidently acting under instructions \u2014 added a very hard insignificant e to the word vaginato, which, if true, aggravated the assault. Probably the whole case fell through, as the \" wiffs of Topsham \" are by no means of an undemonstrative disposition, and the portyngale may have waited the next high tide and got off with all speed over Exmouth Bar. The following is a case in point as regards the parochial clergy. The depositions lack nothing by being given verbatim. \" Capta suit sequens examinacio coram Reverendo Patre Domino Williehmo Exon Episcopo (absente Thoma Williams ejus Vicario generali) . . . die mensis Martii A.D. 1568.\" The first witness was Thomas Chanan, of Huxham (near Poltimore), husbandman ; had lived there from his infancy ; aged 25 ; freeman ; he deposed : \u2014 That upon a Saterdaye before the last generalle Assizes holden at Exon, after evening prayer beinge finished and ended, the parson ot Huxham, a Mr. Anthonie Robyns, of Huxham also, meeting together without the churchyarde, fell at variaunce about certayne shepe of one John Chanan, this deponent's brother, which by fortune brake into the grounde of the said Anthonie Robyns ; for this deponent saythe that the person aforesayde had sett to this deponent's brother"], [24, "PREFACE.

Whereupon the parson and Anthonie falling out at variance, the parson said : Neighbour Anthonie, if I have hindered thee any waye, chuse one of your neighbours whom it shall please thee, and I will chuse another who, yf they can fynde that I have hindered thee, I will make the amends for it as they shall thincke well. Whereupon the said Anthonie, further chafeing with anger, said : None of my neighbours shall have to deall in my matters. Then said the parson : Then in this so saing thou speakest like a soole ; for a better man than thou art would putt his matters to his honest neighbours' judgment. Whereupon Anthonie Robyns forwith offered to strike the priest, thrusting at him very vehementlie with his fiste, and the priest stepping backe quicklie, Anthonie missed his blowe and fell down upon his face. Then immediately this deponent stepped to the said Anthonie and cautjht him about the myddle. Then the said Anthonie, swearing by Godd's bloode, required this deponent to lett him goe. And so in the ende they both parted, one one way and the other another waye. The second witness gives, if possible, a fresher account of the whole affair. Bartholomew Hearde was his name, and he had lived at Huxham about eight years. He was in the churchyard at Huxham at the aforenamed time, and dyd here the parson and Anthonie Robyns chiding (as he at last did understand) about shepe, and approaching nere to here the matter, at last he harde the parson saye to Anthonie : What ayleth thee, foolish man ? I thincke thowe be madde. Whereupon Anthonie stepping back and comming to Mr. Parson sayd : Hence, naughtie parson ! Dost thou call me soole ? By Godd's bones I will dress thee for it ; and then this deponent came over the hedge, and so in the ende they parted asondre, but this deponent was not present at the whole matter from the beginninge : et sic aliter nescit deponere. March 22nd these two witnesses were again called before the Bishop, and after taking a corporal oath that their depositions were true they were let go. So, as far as we know, this matter dropped also. It is not many miles byroad, or as the crow flies, from Poltimore Park to Widworthy, Offwell, and Farway (lovers of trout streams might do far worse than try that country in the season). December nth, 1582,"], [25, "PREFACE. XXI was a date of no slight national interest, but to John Pynney, of Widworthy, it may have been of personal interest, for he was examined in the Palace at Exeter, before Mr. Jermyn, the Bishop's Registrar, on certain Articles of a libel of which, however, we have no record or further idea than what is given in his personal replies to the same. To the first and second his answers were in the negative. To the third he replied that he said the prophet Jonas was sent to the Nynyvites, and they repented ; but he prayed God these preachers be not sent of the devell. To the last he says that X or XII yeres past he said and affirmed meerely that the Parson of ffarwaye married together a goose and a gander ; the rest of the article is not true. This presumably was his reply to certain charges laid against him in the Consistorial Court by his Rector and other friends who did not approve of his plain speaking, though they may have thought more highly of his logic. Next come the answers of the witnesses against him, examined at same place and before same official in February, 1582. John Thomas, constable of Wydworthy, was the first witness called ; 50 years of age. To Article I. he could answer nothing. To II. he says that a lytle before Michaelmas last, he and this respondent, ryding betwene Exeter and Faremyle, in the company of Messrs. Bampfeld, Richard Purchase, John Pynney, and one other man whom he now remembreth not, where amongst other talk had, the sayd John Pynney uttered these words : Yf I had L\u00a3 I would (gyve yt to be made a minister) sue to my Lord Bishop and be made a minister, and so get me a benefyce and rack my parishe and go into the pulpitt and sell smoke unto them ; but whether he meant my Lord Bishop of Exeter, or spake those words and smell smoke nescit deponere, he cannot say. Article III. he knew nothing about. Article IV. is true, he says ; and further, that Pynney uttered the same words synce Mydsomer last, at Widworthy, as they walked together. signed, John Thomas. The second witness was the aforesaid Richard Purchase, of Offwell, husbandman, 60 years old. His evidence agreed with that of his \" precontest,\" Thomas, but the conversation had made more impression on his mind, for he recollected that Pynney began by saying : Yf I had my money agayne which I have paid for land I have bought, I would be a loser thereby"], [26, "PREFACE. XXII XX;\u00a3, and never purchase land. Why, quoth this respondent unto him : What woald ye then do ? Mary, I would go to the Bishop, and for L\u00a3 be made a minister, and within a short space I would get me a Benefice and a long gowne, and walk amang the best of them, and go into the pulpytt and sell smoke unto them. To whom Mr. Bampfeld sayd : May ye be made a minister (thus speaking to Pynney) that can scarce reade English ? Then quoth Pynney : For money I will buy althings, etc., etc. William Bampfeld, alias Rodes, was of Honiton; 50 years old. He said that certain scoffing and scandalc us words were used by Pynney in the presence of the Parson of Widworthy, andthis respondent was requested to bear wytness to it. Pynney said further : I will go abroade and be a preacher, and make sermons, and be called Sir John Smell smoke. John Pynney had also said, \" within this half yere, that the Parson of ffarway had maryed together a goose and a gander, and spake it very scoffingly at Mr. Chichtster's house in Widworthy.\" Bampfeld could only make his mark, which resembles the gallows on a small scale. The fourth witness was Bartholomew Palmer, the parson himself, Rector of Wydworthy ; 30 years of age ; but his evidence was merely hearsay. Thomas Rodden (perhaps Rawden), Rector of Offwell, replied to Article I. as follows , \u2014 Pynney and he, having talk together of tythes, Pynney spake very irreverently of my Lord Bishops Consistory, but what the words were he perfectly remembreth not ; but well he is assured he requested one William Gifford then present to beare witness thereunto, who who said : I pray you, Mr. Parson, let yt passe. Further, he sayth that talking of late with the sayd Gifford, Gifford said unto this respondent : I here say Pynney denyeth that he sayd the Devell sitteth in his own Consistory. Dyd not he say so in Offwell Church in your presence and myne ? To whom this respondent answered : I remember now he dyd ; which causeth him therefore verely to beleve the Article proposed to him is trew. Robert Cate (witness VI.), aged 22, was of Offwell. His reply to the third Article is rich enough to pass without comment or contraction, though he does not describe the effect on the Rector. The Parson of Widworthy. preaching a sermon at Wydworthy, taking for his texte these words out of the prophet Jonas: \"And yet XL days before Nynyvy shall be destroyed;\" treating thereon, said : The Nynyvites, within this short tyme or one warning, repented ; but how happeneth that we, having so many and"], [27, "PREFACE. XXIII ofTen warnings and sermons, do not repent Then Pynney, sytting in his pue, sayd these words : Jonas was sent from God, and that was the cause they repented ; but you are sent from the devell, and therefore we do not repent. But whether he meant generally of all prechers, or of Mr. Palmer, he cannot certainly depose. This Pynney may, with some justice, be considered as the aggrieved parishoner par excellence. These, and the following depositions, were repeated before the Lord Bishop. His Lordship's opinion of Mr. Pynney does not appear, nor have we any record of the punishment imposed. William Gifford, of Offwell, fifty-five years of age, said that three quarters of a yere past, John Pynney and the Parson of Offwell talking together touching tythes payable unto him by Pynney, for composing of which matters this examinate made an awarde betwene them. And they three being come into Offwell Church, Mr. Raddon sayd : In truth I would have recovered yt in the Consistory by Law. To whome Pynney answered : I have heard an olde storye that where the devell sytteth in his own consistory, lett not a man go to law, for he the devell, will be judge of his own court. The odium in which both the Bishop and his court were held is well illustrated by another incident which occurs on the page following Pynney's case. It is called, \"The Confession of John Vyner, of Lazante, made of his own free will and accord to certain Articles.\" Some of the charges contained in the document here referred to will not bear quotation, but the gist of the business is as follows : \u2014 Imprimis, he saith that comminge by chaunce to Polparayn Chappell, he found theare one Thomas Skynner ; of Lynkinhorne, apparator, holding up a quorum nomina in his hand, saieing to the company then and theare assembled, which weare about a dozen persons, that he had theare a commission from my Lorde Bishoppe to examyne such persons as he was to calle : \u2014 Nicholas Waye was called upon to answer a charge which need not be particularized ; the defendant denying it, Skynner threatened that he would make the said Waye spend one of his boates (referring thus obviously to his means of obtaining a livelihood as a fisherman), but he would make him confess it, and said that he had a commission theare to trye it. Item, Christopher Maunsell commyng also thether, and rebuking Skynner for his fayned and counterfeyte Commission and Courte keeping, the said Skinner answered : Whye maye I not kepe a Courte of Knaverie? Students of Church History will recognize in these official reports"], [28, "PREFACE. XXIV circumstantial corroboration of the somewhat misty, but undoubtedly authentic impressions, formed in their minds by the drier and more laboured accounts of standard writers on the Reformation Period. At the same time, if there are any who question the advantages of the old or modern Acts affecting tithe owners and tithe payers, they will be in all probability convinced of the evils of the old system, and immense advantage of doing away with any method which creates or allows of undesirable opportunities of malice and discontent between parish priest and people. The immense variety of cases which came before the Consistory may be well illustrated by this almost pathetic inventory of the goods and chattells of the Parson of a village which has few equals in interest and beauty among the many lovely hamlets of Devon. When the Rector* of Teigngrace, in September, 1541, claimed the effects of a nameless predecessor in the benefice, Thomas Kelar (probably Kelland) replied that these were the only effects found in the house of the deceased : \u2014 One gown, value 5s. ; one horse, worth 25s. 8d. ; a fether-bedd two blankets, worth 20s. ; the which fether-bed the respondent did deliver unto William Kelar de Lapford, at the commandement of his brother parson departed ; apparell at prised 4od. ; halffe-a-dosen books ; a lute, 2s. 8d. ; a flytche bacon, 2od. ; in money 4 nobles and 4od. This he, Thomas Kelar, had administered without leave of the Ordinary, and the deceased had made no will. Moreover the chancel had been left out of repair ; it would cost 6s. 8d., and now no effects were left. He submitted himself to the Court. * In this case probably a Commission had issued to the Rector to take an inventory of the effects and administer the estate."], [29, "JSpfl^Fn J3ogF as Ppo&frlgsf. IT was a long time, as might be expected, before the benefits of pure and simple literature reached the distant Devonshire villages. They still clung to their old dark fancies, and lay dumb beneath the awful horrors of the witch who spoilt their dairies, and of the wizard who killed their children and their cattle. Let us take an instance from the parish of Broad Clyst \u2014 a now highly favoured district for the working men of Devon. Here the staunch old Radical, Sir Thomas Acland \u2014 yet blessed with every faculty of limb and mind \u2014 unceasingly devotes his time and his rents to improving the condition of the labouring class who live on his estate. Brought up in the good old sound school of British patriotism and common sense \u2014 setting aside his political bias, which, in such a champion receives, as it merits, unfeigned respect, he en deavours by the force of personal example and assistance and advice to help working folk to help themselves, and give them some notion of their dormant capabilities for good. Perhaps the Vicar of Broadclyst in 1566 was as of resolute speech and action as Sir Thomas, for he caused great offence, it would seem, to certain persons called Crudge in his parish. The Vicar's name was Richard Holland. Thomas Triggs, a carpenter, said that after the evening prayer, upon Twelfcday, yn the southe yellde, within the parish church of brode clyst, Mr. R. Holland called Crudge most opprobrious names, such as \" a white hare with two legges,\" &c, \u2014 a style of address and insult which none of the parishioners could agree to, Alse Bennett even saying that though she herself \"do the most commonly use her buck in goddly prayer, and using to read A"], [30, "BRAZEN NOSE AT BRODECLYST. with spectacles, Mr. Holland had declared openly in the pulpytte that she was a papiste, and did were her spectacles upon her brasen nose ; which buck she did shewe openly in the Courte, which was a buck of the New Testament in fayre prynte after Tyndale's translation. Jane Moreman, another Brodeclyst witness, said that Mr. Holland had openly declared in the pulpytt that the Justice of the Shere should reprove her, and that she was a wytche, and that she had scurvy hands, and was full of leprosy. Things had come to a pretty pass when compliments of this nature passed between Churchmen in the choir. Mrs. Crudge called Mr. Holland, the Vicar, \" arrant knave,\" in the chaunsell of Brodecliste Churche, upon which he retorted with the same offensive epithet or adjective, and a very shocking substantive. The quarrel arose about a piece of the sanctuary, or glebe which the contending parties had interest in ; but it must be remembered that to call a person a witch was a very un justifiable and most dangerous thing in those days, as a Statute was lately passed (Act v, Eliz., Cap. 16) which enacted that persons exercising witchcraft or enchantment, whereby any persons should be killed or destroyed, should suffer as felons. Ralph Byare knew for a certainty that Joan Moreman and Welshe had accused Juliana Peowtener unto the Justices, but for what crime he knoweth not. Bullocks he had certainly lost, and thought to lose more ; but by what means he knew not. Julian had been charged, thought Michael West, for being a wyche ; and all had been brought before my Lord busshop. The question arises here what part Welshe here mentioned had in getting up the infamous story against Mrs. Crudge. Possibly it was to shield himself, and throw the blame of any thing that went wrong in the parish off his own shoulders. It certainly is remarkable that at this very time we find a very circumstantial account of the methods of one John Welshe, who, indiscreetly coming within the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Exeter, was arrested under the above-mentioned Statute and in hope of escaping the extreme penalties of the law, made a clean breast before the Court of all his machinery and chicanery."], [31, "BRAZEN NOSE AT BRODECLYST 3 At Saint Mary Church, near Torquay, a parish highly favoured during the present century in all Catholic privileges, there was a very remarkable case of witchcraft and incan tation, which we reserve for a subsequent article, and here the parish Priest, Curate to the Dean and Chapter of Exeter, to whom the living belonged, himself spoke to certain facts."], [32, "JKorrljflFb PussIjojj $&m%m$. ON February 6, 1566, a Commission was held by Mr. Thomas Williams, on behalf of the Bishop of Exeter, to receive the personal replies of Roger Rowland, of Morchard Bishop, who said that : \u2014 \" As he was comming throught a wode called heywode, within the parishe of busshop's morchard, in a certayne Sonday after evening prayer, after the Twellfeny laste paste, this respondent, William Radford, and Richard Radford's man, whose name he knoweth not, dyd tarry yn the wode togather, lokynge for Robert back, and Philip More, and when they were all comme togather, they toke an oken bowe of a trye for to brake them downe by strength, and yn pulling of them downe, they brake the bowe of the trye, and fell togather in a slooster, and he had reasons in his hose, and with there falling together, his reasons were at the hole of his pocket. and then he, hanging there, prycked in an apple gave unto every of them having them II. or three reasons, sainge : Take and eate this yn the remembrance of me. Asked whether he spake these words unto ever}- one of them severally, he saythe that he spake these words unto them all at once tyme, and saythe further that he spake them in no contempt of the holly sacrament. They mett togather by chaunce and fortune, comming from the churche after evening prayer. They had no other communicacion touchyng the blessed Sacrament then he hath before declared, and saythe further that he doth alow the communion now used in the Churche to be a holly and blessed Sacrament to put us in remembrance that Christ dyed for us. Robert Back remembered all the same circumstances, how Roger had an apple prycked with reasons, did take oute some of them, and gyve unto every one of them, saying those words, He took it that Roger dyd saye it merylie, and in no hurt."], [33, "MORCHARD BUSSHOP REASONS. 5 He dyd reprove Roger for saying of the sayde words, but Roger made answer and sayde that he dyd thynke no harme yn yt. They met by chauncement. There was no talke amonge them of the blessed Sacrament then, but only the folysh words that were before spoken. John More did declare that Roger did not use the words \" and be thankful.\" They all be hartely sorry for their doings. William Radford, who was also present, said that no one spake unto the words said by Roger, nor did he say \" and be thankful.\" It was the Sunday after the Xllth day, and they mett by chaunce in Heywode after evening prayer. Thus they could not be charged with conspiracy, though the accident of their meeting was certainly open to remark. A spirit of insubordination and impatience was manifested in some places \u2014 generally in the towns, by the unwillingness of the clergy to alter the old ways ; while, in the villages; the simpler folk held on to the more ancient forms and habits. At Exeter, when order was given for the congregational singing of hymns, the Sheriff and many other citizens forced their way into the choir of St. Peter's Cathedral Church and pushed out the Vicar and singing clerks. They were, on this occasion, urged on by some Londoners who had come down to S. Nicholas' revels. On the other hand, we know how the rebels resisted, even unto blood, any alteration in the mass, and were prepared to die fighting for their Latin missal and their pix, and other precious relics of their Ancient Faith. The suspicion and dislike with which the introduction of the new orders in a Protestant direction were received by the poorer and less educated people, is also illustrated in the childish opposition they offered, where possible, to the law which took away from the parochial clergy the liberty of free and plain speech on questions of practice and doctrine, and substituted the Book of Homilies, which were put forth by Cranmer, so that the poor people might have some means of instruction. Some of the Bishops mocked at the \" hawking and chopping,\" as Latimer calls it, whieh these Homilies went through at the hands of priests who did not like them. But some, says Strype, read them very well."], [34, "HJonFg \u00c6hMffs as $TCflPg C$nvt% or <&va\\\\B' Q8rit 1 S78. g^l HE clergy in olden times were, if possible, more at the V_-J mercy of the evil-disposed laity than now, and financially were in far worse case, if by any chance incompati bility of temper could be charged on the parson by the squire where matters of morality turned up. Historians have daubed the memory of the medi\u00e6val clergy with one black brush. Take, for instance, the financial dilemma in which Evans, Vicar of S. Mary Church, found himself in 1579, when being very hard up, he borrowed ,\u00a310 of James Dashpey, on a certain St. Mark's Day, and then again 10s. in gold, \" which was an Angell.\" As to its being only \u00a38 10s., James knew nothing of any such loan, but when Sir Richard Evans would not pay, he got proces against hym, and procured by vertew thereof of his cozen Langworthy to appoynt Baylifes for his apprehension, and they at St. Mary Church Yard did arrest hym, but he would not obey the arrest, but brought them before the next Justyce, and bounde them to the peace. Frequent transactions of this nature had taken place with Parson Evans for money which he had receyved for his owne use, but his non-submission to the arrest reminds one of the way in which a North Devon parson in more modern times treated the bailif who served him with a writ, when, having asked him to have some refreshment, and had supper prepared for his unwelcome guest, a fine savoury mess was devoured by the officer of the law with an appetite sharpened by his long walk and wait, the only drawback to his final and full satis-"], [35, "MONEY MATTERS AT MARY CHURCH. 7 faction being that after the meal was over, the genial host tenderly informed him that he hoped he had had a good supper and enjoyed the writ, which had been ingeniously cooked up with onions and tripe in a most succulent disguise. But Cousen Langworthy had been let in for it considerably as he himself relates, for Dashpey had lent unto Sir Evans X\u00a3, and he, Langworthy, became bound unto Dashpey with Sir Evans, in a byll of XII., but because he neyther could wryte nor reade, he knoweth not what there might be put in the byll, and ferther, he saithe he heard that Sir Evans was arrested, for the said byll of \\2\u00a3, and that, as Sir John Gilbert reported, the same byll of I2,\u00a3 was shewed unto his Worship, but touchyng the cancelling of the byll for 1 \\\u00a3, he denyeth it to be trew. Vicar Evans, Sir, or no Sir, had certainly made a mess of it, so that we need not go to the present century for examples of Jewish extortion, or for a hint how to deal with extortionate usurers. Shylock had little regard at Mary- Church, apparently, for Saint, Church, or Parson, but in return to be brought before a J. P., and lose his Angell, was too much for a medi\u00e6val Israelite. Nor is it surprising that the Parochial Clergy should be subject to all manner of slander and abuse when the enemies of the Reformation, who abounded in the Westernmost counties up to the 18th century, did not hesitate to bring the most scandalous charges against the Bishops whom the Queen, at the instigation of Parker, appointed at this critical period.

ONE of the most scurrilous opponents of Bishop Brad- bridge was a schoolmaster, a clerk in holy orders, called William Mynterne, of Plymouth, whose ribald and blasphemous reports of this prelate were too much for the patience of the Episcopal Court, helpless as all the powers and penalties were to silence the poisonous asps in the distant hamlets of Dartmoor. In some instances there was un doubtedly good cause for suspecting the clergy of rather equivocal, if not criminal conduct ; one Sir John Brawlerd consenting to forge a dede of guifte at the request of one Richard Arscott, of South Tauton. A deed of gift had been properly drawn up and attested and sealed from Avis Arscott and her son Richard, but she wished it cancelled. As soon as Richard heard this, off he goes to Sir John with the original, and desires him to ymytate as nere as he might the very forme of the letters therein con tayned, which in faith was so counterfeyted that Mr. Smyth, though himsefe the writer of the originall dede, was not able upon the vewe thereof to deny yt to be his owne hande. In deed Sir John had done it all marvellous well in making and delyvering of this counterfeit, excepting only the seal, which Richard Arscott had himself put thereto, and Richard threw the blame on Sir John, who had advised him to keep the original and give his mother the bogus deed to make peace. Sir John wrote it on parchment, but apparently he had one parishioner, an old man, a farmer, who could not sit still and see such iniquity unrebuked. He was eighty years old, and when he heard what his parson had done he went and re proached him \" for doing so ungodly a thing.\" Sir John's guilty rejoinder was almost scriptural : I have made him a"], [37, "S/R JOHN THE FORGER OF SOUTH TAUTON. 9 dede, and what hast thou to do therewith ? There was some small discrepancy not in the words nor seals, nor in any other clerical errors, but \u2014 swore this worthy old protestant, Thomas Downing \u2014 in the shape of it. The Vycar made another dede as square as that, and not corner wyse, as the firste was : He challenged Brawlerd as to that. As to his capacity for committing such a fraud \u2014 it was generally known that \" the Vicar can write three diverse hands of writing, and he thynketh in his conscyense that he was privy to this falsehood because he wrote it.\" Well spoken, old friend Dunning ! Thy descendants still live in the same neighbourhood, and farm their own land, 300 years after thy bold protest against ungodliness, and many and long may they live to perpetuate so good a name for all honesty and truth. But the most interesting part of the story comes in the conclusion of this little plot. Farmer Dunning was one of those people who are never so happy as when they are laying or hatching some plot to prove that every unreformed Catholic priest is a machiavellian of the deepest dye. But in this case it is imperative to hear what the Reverend Edward Maebly, who was called in to see William Smyth,\u2014 one of the chief witnesses against Parson Brawlerd \u2014 had to say. Smyth was in extremis : he was not much longer for this world, and his conscience was burdened with a grievous wrong done to his parish priest. Well, thus speaks Edward Maebley : He was with Wm. Smyth in his sickness wherof he died, when he found him perplexed and troubled in mynde, but the chief cause of his inward conceipts he \u2014 the priest \u2014 knew not then, nor yet doth know ; but within a short space of his abode in the said Smyth's company, Smyth said he wished he had never delte so farre against the Vycar \u2014 meaning Mr. Brawlerd. He knew that he had done his best to blacken the Vicar's character and accuse him of fraud and forgery, but when his last hour came, truth prevailed, and the poor fellow acknowledged the guilt of his conduct as the best amendment he could offer. Therefore, De mortuis, &c."], [38, "\u00c6arriFl) fop TQofljing as piopiraL 'g^J HE manifold evils of precocious matrimonial contracts, \\^-J as seen in the good old days, need no exaggeration in the period when nothing attracts public attention more wildly than a breach of promise. The circumstances and conditions of these juvenile engagements were so often more amusing than vulgar, in the modern acceptance of the term, that from its very simple vividness and lifelike sincerity, we cannot for bear quoting the following little peep of social life at Morvall, a scattered parish some six miles south-east of Liskeard, which rejoices in a very ancient Church dedicated to St. Wenn, and the old mansion of Coodes and Bullers, who must have ticked off many a fleeting hour by the dial on the old south porch.

Let us hear, first, what John Tristram of Bampton knew about it. He had known John Vigurs and Elizabeth Laene since they were babies, and about 1 p.m., the day before the Feast of Corpus Christi, was in one Chester's house at Stogumber, in the County of Somerset, to which Elizabeth came by invitation, when he asked her whether she had made any contract of marriage with John Vigurs, and she answered yes, but not in the presence of witnesses ; upon this he said to her : \u2014 Elsabeth, yt war beste for you to make a playne bargan, and calle wittnes thereunto. Wherewith she was contentide ! The ordinary and orderly formal ceremony was then com pleted, and statim osculati su/it ad invicem, \u2014 that is, they instantly kissed each other in turn. But it is a pity to miss the pretty remarks one made of the other, and of the whole proceeding, and how the fond parent came in, as, of course, he always ought to do. There were two or three people who took an interest in the match, and amongst these were John Drew, a yeoman of Kenton, and George Rowls. Indeed, John Vigurs' friends had asked the former to see if he could get old Laene to be reconciled to the idea of the match, and it was for this very purpose that he came to Stogumber and tackled the old man on the question. Unfortunately Elsabeth \u2014 as her name is euphoniously transmogrified \u2014 was in an awful fright of her governor, and"], [41, "ELSABETH'S FADER AT THE STONE. 13 positively quite pale and overcome, but after some trouble the confession was drawn from her : \u2014 I can nott denye that he ys my husbande, and I have made a bargan of matrimonye with hym. Upon which her father in fury rushed from the place which was a garden within the hospice \u2014 literally speaking \u2014 and elicited from Mr. Drew \u2014 who, mark you, was a gentle man of credit and renown himself: \u2014 Suche gentlemen as you be doth cause her for feare so to confesse. Vigurs, however, had also two more friends, Robert Tookar (a man of some standing, fifty-four years of age,) and Thomas Spurway, who came to Mr. Lane on May 18th, desyringe him and his wiffe that they might speke unto theire doghter. With which requeste they were contente. So they asked her the same question as others had, but \" she did stand still and slackarde at yt.\" Upon which he, Tookar, by way of shewing his ability as a father confessor, thought proper to say : \u2014 You have sume thinge in yure harte. Open yt ; I will avyse you. Do you bare hym any love or favor ? Yes, forsuth, said she. Then said Bob T. \u2014 the old friend of over fifty summers: \u2014 You speke lyke a honeste wenche. Ys there any privye contracte made betwixt you ? Said she : \u2014 Yt was done before so many witnesses that yt can nott be denyed. Thou arte the more honeste wenche to tell the trewth, quoth he. So the usual \" kissing together \" was gone through, and then she asked them to take her father oute and to require his goode wille, and upon this they tooke hir fader to the stone* in Saint Peter's Churchyarde, and movede hym to put his goode will to the bargen. Howbeit, Laene, calling Vigurs alle evell names, wold never aggre to yt. Consequently \u2014 exeunt omnes except John and Elsabeth left kissing. \u2022What this \"on the stone in St. Peter's Churchyard \" means, it is apparently impossible to discover.

V^L* HE difficulty of preserving peace and goodwill between V\u00bb^J the two principal persons of the parish has been illustrated in not a few parishes in modern times, but in Reformation days, the form which contempt or spite took was frequently that of violence and insult, and became so in jurious to the chief parties concerned that the law must perforce take cognisance thereof. From the depositions of the witnesses taken before the Rev. Father in God John (Woolton), by Divine providence, now Bishoppe of Exon, on the 20th day of April, 1585, and produced on behalf of Edward Babington, clerk, Vicar of Ugberow, upon certain Articles, ministered by her Majesty's High Commissioners for causes Ecclesiastical against Richard ffowell, Esquier, we gather that the climax of disagreement was reached on a Sunday about a fortnight before the last Michaelmas Assises in the forenoon, when George fferres, Phillip Voysey, and other servants, to the number of seven, belonging to their master, Mr. Richard ffowell, Esquier, entered into the chauncell at the time of divine service, where at the commandment of their master, they then and there laid hands on John Cole, a servant to Mr. ffountayne, Esq., and arrested him upon suspicion of felony, and charged both of the constables then present, in the fast keeping of said Cole, without offering to strike or beat him, otherwise than by clapping their hands on his shoulders and saying I arrest thee."], [43, "FOWELL IN UGBOROUGH CHURCH. 15 The service was much interrupted and stayed for a little space, and afterwards was again proceeded with by the Minister to the no little offence of the parishioners there assembled. Some said Mr. ffowell was naturally a harsh man who would knock his servants, whistle for them like hounds, or call them roughly, but Richard Dockets could only testify as a free man, and no serf, that he would only summon them with a modest signe of a beck with his hed or his hands, and therefore no disturbance can have arisen or growen by his commandment. Mr. Babington's idea was that he had a grievance against the Squire, and certainly the steps which Mr. ffowell took to shew his authority and power were extremely obnoxious, not only to the Vicar, but to the congregation worshipping in Ugborough Church, as well as to the family of the parson. The Vicar had erected a pew or seat for his wife in the Church, but Mr. ffowell, without any explanation, sent one of his men to pull it down, and said he would justify his so doing, though it is described as being \" in the Vicar's chauncell whearein his wyfe and servaunts did accustomably sytt.\" Nor was it the first or only occasion on which he had disturbed the divine service. Walter Stevens, a serving man of Ugborough, was in Church on April 12th in the same year, and saw Phillip Voysy and George fferres, in the presence and sight of Mr. ffowell, goe into the chauncell, the Vicare being ministeringe the sacramente of the Lord's Supper, and then and theare take Mr. Trevisour by the cloke, and clapping their hands some three or sower tymes with some violence upon his shoulder, a litle before the mynisteringe of the communyon, as he, Mr. Trevisour, was kneeling upon his knees, intending with others theare to receave the communyon, by meanes of which the said Mr. Trevisour was forced to forbeare for that tyme. Opinions seemed pretty equally'divided as to the character of Edward Babington, the Vicar. So far as personal obser vation went, he was \" of good conversation, a man of perfect opynyon.\" While others said that as touching his conversa tion \u2014 \"by report of others\" \u2014 [jwta bene \u2014 no personal know ledge) \u2014 he is a bad man, a drunkard, a brawler, &c, and \" emongest his neighbours he is so commonly reported.\" C"], [44, "16 FOWELL IN UGBOROUGH CHURCH. Possibly in consequence of these evil reports Mr. ffowell thought he might address Mr. Babington as \" false knave,\" and in other uncomplimentary terms, but this was not enough. On Easter day, a year before, Mr. ffowell and Grace, his wiffe in the afternoone, passing by the Vicar of Ugborough's wife said : If you owe no duty to me, I will do duty to you, which Mistress ffowell capped by remarking : Every dishwasher of ... . out of London will com pare herself with every gentlewoman! Hoity-toity ! But the Squire had a witness, who, as he thought, could bring up altogether damning evidence against the parson. His name was John Russell, and evidently from his own account he was a highly respectable person, and had taken sufficient note of the Vicar's doings to observe that he often used to go about II yeres past to Wembury, being acquainted with certen honest persons there, and dyd use III or IV tymes in passing to and fro to call at the house of Martha Morcock, who then sold beare onely in that Towne of Nasse, and there was accustomed to eate and drineke between whome he never knew any dishonest life or other lose behaiyour netther ever heard of such saying by the reporte of Mr. ffowell and his company, adversaries as he thyncketh^ to the said Vicar. One other occasion he could call to mind : The Vycar of Ugborow being at Plympton markets in the of Robert Morecock, husband to Martha, dranck together at the house of one Eady of Plimpton, then Maior^of Plympton, where he beleveth Martha was sent for by her husband, whither she came not, nor was she at any other tyme in the company of the Vycar, wherby any other offence might growe. Thus this disreputable tittle-tattle did not gain much by Russell's telling, though, when it came to other equally, if not more compromising suggestions as to the Vicar's slightly mixed qualifications as a man about town, ale-taster, and medical practitioner, it is less surprising if some of his attempts at surgery and landscape gardening admitted of misinterpretation. Some said he endeavoured to add to his means by curing subtle and complicated contagious disorders which were un-"], [45, "FOWELL IN UGBOROUGH CHURCH. 17 English in character, and betook rather of the French-Norman idiosyncrasies. Mr. ffowell, at the same time, must not be foiled in his resolution to malign Edward Babington, so Russell further could testify that he, the Vycar, hath some judgment in surgery, but in what he dealeth concerning the same he knoweth not, neither ever knew hym to intermedle with the curing of any disease, nor did he have any hand in killing of Martha Morcock ; but II yeres passed he removed two White Thornes growing in the Churchyard, which was no hedge nor inclosure, and he also erected a seate for his wife in the chauncell of Ugborow, but whether with the consent of the parishioners or not he knoweth not ; he hath not abused him self towards them, but some controversie there hath been between the Vycar and a poore man, one John Coone, but for what matter he likewise knoweth not, yet at this present beleveth one to love another as they oughte. O quam bonum ! &c. This has a highly respectable and indeed Biblical ring about it, and expressed by insinuation the conditions of feeling which should have existed, no doubt, between squire and parson. But the story illustrates the mischievous propensity which is, in some villages, too laboriously cultivated, of making mountains of molehills, and setting Church against State, or vice versa.

There was an Archdeacon of Totnes, by name Oliver Whiddon, in the days of Queen Elizabeth, who, having a mind to get his will properly attested, invited some of his neighbouring clergy and chums to dinner, and thus did business ; but when the will came to be proved, on December ioth, 1580, in the Principal Registry, some little discussion arose as to the circumstances of this last testament, and so we get a vivid account of what occurred. Francis Whiddon was not satisfied with the will and con tested it, so that Thomas Phippes, clerk, Curate of Combin tenhed for six years, had to say what he knew about it. About four years paste, betweene Easter and Whytson tyde, Mr. Archdeacon Whyddon, deceasyd, being at Com byntynhed, at his house sytting at dinner, where accompanyed him Francis Whyddon, his brother, Nicholas Coome, and one Chrofer Persse, deceased where, at the end of the same dynner, sytting styli at his table, Mr. Archdeacon willed one of his servaunts wayting there to reach unto hym a paper lying in the wyndow there in his parlour, which being brought him scaled close with red wax, Mr. Archdeacon sayd : \u2014 This ys my last will and testament, and I pray you all beare wytnes hereunto and put your hands unto the same.

When ? Ouoth Thomas. Within this monethe, answeared the sayd testator, who dyed that very night. And at this time there was also present one Thomas Portingall, of Chagford, when Archdeacon Whydden spake of amending his will. It was on Wednesday, 23rd Nov. 1580. Phippes had indeed been more than servant, and more than curate, he had been the Archdeacon's confidential com panion, and \" from tyme to tyme hath been partaker of his mynde in som thinges espetiallye herein.\" John Babbe was parish clerk, and consequently a man of property, and not to be bought or influenced by a bribe being worth 20,\u00a3, though at the same time \" he lyveth by weaving ;\" still he had every right to his own opinion like any other man, and thought verily that Mr. ffrancis Whydden to have right unto the goods of the Archdeacon. But Edward Lang said they could not all write who wit nessed Mr. Archdeacon's will, for such as could not made \" their marks.\" He could write, and what was more to him, but less as it would seem to the point, \"he is clerely worth forty marks, and myndeth to marry, and so settle himself to lyve in some honest trade.\" Note cause and effect : matrimony, cause : honest trade, effect. But Nicholas Coone was a useful witness, for he brings in a little tit-bit of news, how that he had come on busyness from his master, Mr. ffountayne, to know when Mr. Arch deacon would ryde towards London.

Richard Beare's wife, Philippa, was fifty years of age when she was called upon to state on oath the number of children she had had, the order they were born in, and what had become of them. Here she had lived from her infancy, or, as it was more accurately expressed \u2014 ab incunabulis, from her cradle. She had had eight children, two ded, and six alyve. John, Arthure, Edmund, ffraunces, Philip, Margaret, Walter, and the other a chrysom. John was the eldest ; Arthur the second ; Edmund the third ; ffraunces the fourth ; Philip the fifth ; Walter the sixth ; Margaret the seventh. The expression chrysom is very singular. It is often met with in ancient registers. It was an apt and happy term of euphony for babes who only survived their birth one month. At their baptism, clad in the holy white cloth, which symbolized their unstained purity, they could never, as it seemed, in all human dependence on the Divine mercy, have any sin imputed to them. Thus it was but fit that they should bear the name of the same white robe which at their baptism they put on. What year, then, of King Edward was her son Arthur born ?"], [50, "THE BEARE PEDIGREE. 22 She knoweth not, but at Midsummer last he was XXIII. yere old. When was she and her husband, Richard Beare, married ? About Mydsummer after the commosyon, but who were present at their maryage she knoweth not. How long after her marriage was her first child, Richard, born ? About three quarters of a yere. And further being asked what distance was between the age of Richard and Arthur, she sayth she had never a child called Richard, and therefore she cannot depose anything about him. Joane Lane, Richard Beare's grandmother \u2014 or rather, Arthur's, (for Richard Beare fils never existed), also had to state numerically the order of Philippa's children, but she never heard of a Richard amongst them. She recollected the marriage, because Mr. Nick was there with his wiff, and Mr. Edmund Wood, and her daughter was likely to be a mother almost as soon as she was a wife ; and \" this was twelve monethes after the commosyon.\" How much distance between Richard and Arthur ?

This was Vincentius Calmady, fifty years of age. His evidence was not all hearsay : \" He hath herd dyvers persons say that Arthurc Bere will not be XXIII yere old be fore July next, the tenth day.

Scarcely restrained until Whit- Monday from openly expressing their indignation at the king's commands and New Prayer Book, in every village almost throughout Devon public feeling broke out in overt acts of resistance. One old woman who met Mr. Walter Raleigh, the father of Sir Walter, on his way to Exeter, was merely the mouthpiece of thousands throughout Devon and Cornwall, who counted their parish churches as sanctuaries indeed, and the repositories of all they held most sacred and dear. The Fifteen Articles of the \"Cornish rebels\" were a summary of the doctrines and practices which the Catholic Church had handed down to them for centuries, and against them all Cranmer's rude and bombastic expostulation was wasted energy.

It is not necessary to go back to the days of Latimer and Ridley to find out how anomalies and difficulties which sorely beset the country clergy in their remote vicarages, pre vented their being in touch with the intellectual and social progress of the day.

The transitional crisis of the sixteenth century tells many a tale of such sore wounds, and were no Clergy Discipline Bill, at this very moment, in the hands of the Primate, the stigma of such rebukes would have been long obliterated from the present generation at least. In the days, however, of William Alley, the office of Bishop or of Chief Deacon in any Diocese was no sinecure, and in the Archdeaconry of Barum (in modern parlance, not so frequently heard as Barn staple), there were not a few clergy who resented the inter ference of any authority with their own lascivious propensities with a more self-righteous indignation than any resolution in matters ceremonial or ritual, on which the king's action against Rome or the Primates in favour of Geneva might insist. The village of Martinhoe, famous for nothing in particular but its embattled church tower and the lovely walk along the cliffs from Wooda Bay to Hunter's Inn, nestles in a snug nook of the coast of the Bristol Channel. Here, in 1568, William Martindale was clerk ; by his irregular behaviour he had taken more than his share of the Archdeacon's attention, and brought himself under a charge which the Canons ecclesiastical had contemplated of long time ; namely, the difficulties and dilemmas which on every side beset the bachelor-parson with a domestic establishment which could scarcely exist without a gyp and a feminine bed maker.

But Geyke (so saith Baumicke) dyd lytle thincke that he, Robert, had been there at that tyme ; no, nor Thomas and Joane with him ; but it was very dark the self-same night. And so when Geyke lett them yn, Robert took his leave and went his wayes.

He solved the difficulty thus : \u2014 \" If they are not man and wiff, as some beleve, then, as others beleve, he kept her company for his plesure.\" A very proper and plausible alternative."], [59, "j\u00a3 JBahWgng JBapgain. ~g(~L HERE were, however, two young people of Ashperton V_*J who looked at things in a much more business-like way, whether owing to the \" ayle at Wodland parishe,\" or the affection begotten of a long walk together to her father's house through the country lanes.

Whereupon, he went to Grace and said, Sister, I understand by your mother there is liking between you and one Hugh Smerte. What is your mynde ? Are you willing to marry him? Then he asked Hugh the same, and told him him that such land as he had must be made sure to his sister and to her heires. So needs must they go to Richard Page ; so they came there between XI. and XII. in the night. Where, when he had knocked, the servaunte of the house asked the cause of the noise and Smote said he was sent for her master by Mr. John Vylvaine, who then lay very ill, to come and speak with him. So Smote went up to Page, who was then in bed, but came down, and they all came to Mistress Gater's porch, where Page examined them, and joined them together.

The only compensation apparently being that when they came to Mr. Page's house, he found a reason able fyer, and a pot with a litle quantity of wyne, which he shared with Myzie, who is a yeoman, and holdeth ground at an yearly rent, and lyveth thereon, and hath a tenement of his own in Oxfordshire in the parish of Steeple Aston, besides Woodstock."], [64, "l^anlF \u00a9PFnofof ljF : Ijis dMIjobofg. g^if HE ancient customs which obtained in the parish >JiJ churches are always allowed to be of much interest and some practical value even in these hard times, and explain frequently modern habits of thought and speech in a very pertinent fashion, as well as peculiarities of structure. In Cornwall they are specially attractive because from the very remoteness of the towns and villages from the great centres of commercial bustle and intellectual activity the old uses of manorial service and tenure held out against all the innovations of statute and resolution, and even now in many villages remain unchanged. Take now the village of St. Issey \u2014 a pleasant village on the high road from Wadebridge to Padstow \u2014 known best by antiquarians, for its circular intrenchment and the remains of the old house of the Champernown family, called Halwyn ; with all its little Tres of Dinnick, Law, Nance, Vance and Gonce \u2014 within two miles. In July, 1566, a commission was issued by the Bishop of Exeter to try a case between John Harry, John Warryn, and William Pearse, who leased the tithes, fruits, and profits of the benefice, and Paul Trenowthe, parishioner. It appears \u2014 if we may believe the word of John Layne, a husbandman of the place, who was sixty years old, that he had known Paul for over forty years. He said moreover that the custom of the parish is that when soever any person within that parish doth come unto lawfull eyres of discretion for to receave the Holly Sacrament of the body and blud of our Lord Ihu Christ, that then they do paye unto the Vycar or his fermer, at Ester, every eyre theire generall offerings dayes for it is dewe to be payde quarterly."], [65, "PAULE TRENOWTHE. 37 Paule Trenowthe and his wyffe be inhabitaunts and dwellers within the parish, and do hyer God's devyne service there ; but he refuses to paye his tithes, and has always done so.

At Ester they, the parishioners, do use to paye lid. eyrely for there offering dayes, and when the Crosse was used they did use to offer some hake, some eggs, and some corne. True, he, John Layne, married John Harris's sister, but he has no wish for victory to one more than to the other partie ; he only wants his travelling expenses. Edward Lobbe, as a parishioner, could also say the same, and he knew Paul Trenowthe and his wife did receive the sacrament, and do \" hier God's devine serves.\" He and his wife paid lid. at Ester. At offering days he paid III. half-pence for III. offering days, and some paid ferthing cakes, and eggs, and corne, and a ferthing for Peter's pardon, as it was named in those days ; never less than lid. John Cornysshe paid for himselfe, and his servants lid. when they were of the age to receive the Holy Sacrament \u2014 and Paul Trenowthe declared he paid the usual offerings and no more now would he: there ! And what they pay now \u2014 who can tell ? Let Legossic mine say what pays ! The difficulties connected with the payment of tithes under the old regime were undoubtedly operating through hundred of years in bringing about a law which if, as it then appeared, was more just in its proportions to all concerned, was only good enough for a short sixty years, and culminated in the year of grace, 1891, in an Act of Parliament which still only breaks up half the difficulty. The Tithe Act of 1891 is possibly an improvement on that of 1837.

William Noble \u2014 as we should now spell it \u2014 had lived there fifty years, so that his memory could take him back to the days of Bishop Old ham (who had his clocks timed to synchronise with his work) and he said that he was certain that for over forty years the parishioners paid their \" whyte soole of butter and chese, and dyd brynge hit to the church, before the present daye to the parson, and before this parson's day, that now is, unto Sir William Bray, priest and fermour {i.e. lessee), or to one Mr. Burgiss, parson of Lawhitton, about XII yeres agone: About XI yeres agone to Sir Robert Dassell, priest and preacher, to Sir John Hampton, then parson, and so had his father-in-law, John Cardevv.

He himself, for example, had last year VI. milch cows and XII milch sheep, and so he paid to the Rector thre cheses and a dishe of butter, worth Xld., which he calculated as being 4d. for one cheese, id. for the two others, and 3d. for butter. Report said that id. could only be charged for a milch cow, and \\d. for a veyre cow, and a farthing for a yowe. One thing, however, is quite clear, that while William Noble did not, as he confessed, catch even- word or public notice which the Rector spake aloud in church, he often heard him read the King's injunctions. The before-mentioned Collyn, another parishioner, had a better memory, for the Rectors and their deputies possibly, because he was servant to one William Lynerne for thirty years, who was proctor for Sir John Hampton, with Mr. Henry Tracarell ; then came Sir William Knott, whose deputy was one Richard Clotworthy : To Knott succeeded Richard Carlyon, to whom also Clotworthy acted deputy until another Rector, who was an absentee, never coming into the parish. Then for four years Collyn went with his master to Launceston, during which time \" there was no Sunday,\" but he adds very significantly he or another servant was sent to gather the tithes, and \" he was privie to this,\" presumably that there was \" no Sunday.\" As to the value of milk \" he himself would give XXd. yerely for the mylke of every cowe that cometh to the buckets, but he would not take upon him to name all those who paid whitesole, as, if he named amiss, the parish might lay to him perjury. The reason why tithes in kind had not been paid generally was that \" there was never a parson resident uppon the benefyee afore this mann, and the mome was more necessarye for the procters.\" In such cases almost every new witness added some item of information of value and interest, filling up the picture of old life in our country villages, and presenting a brightly vivid scene of ecclesiastical and social affairs."], [69, "WHITE SO LE AT LA WH1TT0N. 41 Now, for instance, we learn from Clotworthy that Richard Kyto, or Kitoo, (for it is spelt in these two ways indifferently in ten lines) was Sir John Hampton's locum tenems, and that he was a very popular pulpytter \u2014 if we may coin such a word from the previous expression \u2014 \" for he had sene so many brynge tythyng butter and chese to the churche where the windo before Saynt Myghell, when was nott roome inoughe they wold sett uppon the grounde before image.\" Though he was not so much afraid of an indictment for perjury, he declined to mention the names of those special parishioners whom he saw walking to the church with their tithes all the time he received them for the parson ; for saith he : If I name any more I shall have sore displesur of my neighbors, and vox populi was in this case as terrible as vox Dei. Indeed, some were so poor, like Tooker, against whom the present parson brought an action that the}- could not pay if they would, and the plea that there was an old custom for some to pay and others not, he had never heard of in his life. In his opinion the church would lose by receiving money and not kind, for \" there is a conscyance in hit, because a kow in mylke is better than a pennye.\" Peter Daw, the village carpenter, was conveniently defec tive in his memory, though he could recollect his mother paying tithe of white sole, and his wife too, unawares to him self, but his work, as he said, took him out of the parish. Still one occasion was impressed indelibly upon his mind, when Sir Thomas, the parson, redde the King's injunctions, and said if the parishioners wold not paye there tythes, butter and chese, lie wold ty the kynge and them together. This threat had the desired result for that year, but the next year the more part of the parish refused, \" becaused they perceaved that the King's injunctions denayed hitt.\" Henc forth the parson refused money. A cow's milk he valued by the year at Xd., and no more. The scale of payment was id. for a cow ; Id. for a veyre cow ; id. for a calls if sold ; \u00a3d. if to be reared ; {d. for a yew !

However, they \" varyed \" again, and it was static quo with a vengeance. But even to those outlandish parts of the world it would seem civilization had reached with its refining influence, for when this case came on before Mr. John Blaxton, on Jan. 18, the same yere, John Shere said that he had paid these tithes simply ex urbanitatc sua, out of his civility, and then, because the Rector or his deputy, asked them only from those who conveniently could pa}- them. His description of the incident previously referred to in the church about the king and the parishioners being tyed together, resolved itself into the threat that \"they should fall in the king's danger.\" This, being King Henry VIII., was enough probably to make anybody fork out, and no doubt but the very idea of any interference from those royal hands, in the case of butter and cheese, was enough to induce compliance. But with or without this awful warning, the succession of names in the parish history is of value, and we learn from Johan Shere, alias Hodge (or, as we should now say, ne'e Hodge) that she recollected and knew well Sir John Saby, who was Rector sixty years ago, since which time no Rector had ever resided at Lawhitton.

The neighbourhood of Hatherleigh is not of the gentle and mild character which characterises South Devon, nor does it offer the grand sweeping landscapes of Dartmoor. The borough, however, owns over 400 acres of the moor, near the town, and here is the famous well of St. John, whence water in ancient times was fetched for baptism. In 1539, Jan. 26th, a commission sat to settle certain disputes as to the bounds of the estate called Northcote, for tithing purposes, which had arisen between Alexander and Margery Medlande, his wife, and Mr. William Spalding, Vicar of Hatherleigh. Richard Parr, the witness who first was called, probably claimed with some justice to be the oldest inhabitant, and being ninety years of age, was a living proof that the occupa tion of charcoal burner, even on those bleak hill sides, which look towards the North-east, was not prejudicial to health and long life. He had known four other Vicars as well. About sixty years ago when he was servant to Mr. Thomas Amadas, Vicar of Hatherleigh, he happened to meet one, Mr. William Yeo, of the parish of Stowe Petrock, in one Genyng's house, at Hatherleigh, so he went and told his master, who thereupon went unto the house of Genyngs, and \" welcumbede Mr. Yeo to the towne, beyng then both Lorde and [tenannte of Northcote, where and when Mr. Amadas, then Vicar of Hatherleigh, did demande of Mr. Yeo XXd. for one yere's Justements of Northcote, due unto the Vicarage of Hather leigh.\" He actually saw Mr. Yeo pay this sum to the Vicar"], [73, "TITHES AND TENNIS AT HATHERLEIGH. 45 for these Justements : He received actually in cash\" III I grotts and I II I small pens, of the which one was a litill pennye, which litill pennye he Richard Parre desiryde of the Vicar, his master, to playe at the tennys, and hade hitt, and, there and then, the Vicar did spcnde upon Master Yeo I Id. of the same 1 1 II smaule penns for a quart of wyne.\" This was on the Saturday after Trinity, sixty years ago. A certain Thomas Medlande then lived in a house called Marseforde, in Hatherleigh parish, and had a farm adjacent, and joining hard {cohere/item) to the agistement de Northcote with a distinct and divided hedge (sepe), especially on the side of the Northcote agistment, which is called Mylham, which said parcel (particula) Thomas Medlande then held and ploughed and sowed with oates, the tithes of which oates Thomas Medlande used to pay (solvebat), about forty-five years ago to one John Hasyde, then lessee of the Rectory of the Abbot and Convent of Tavistoke, and proprietor of the church parish of Hatherleigh. He knew it for certain, be cause \" he did mowe the same ootys in the same place, called Milhyam, which is a parcel of Northcote, and there and then Thomas Medlonde dide shew him that the said hayside had sowlde the said tythyng ootys, but to whom he knew not, and there and than Thomas Medlonde did shew him also that one Walter Ellacotte, parson, than of Inwardeligh, did offer to sell the said ootys unto Medlonde,\" who had told him in reply that they belonged to Hatherleigh Church and Rector, because that farm was within the bounds and limits of Hatherleigh. \" Than cannot I have hit,\" was the very sensible remark of Mr. Ellacotte, who then departed. Then said Parr, as confirmation of this statement : Thomas Medlande, goyng in procession in the Rogacion weyke, offerede to shewe unto Sir Thomas Courtis, then Vicar of Haytherlegh, how muche of Northcote was within his paryshe, and how much was within the paryshe of Inward leighe. As far as he himself, Richard Parre, knew, this is how the parish and said agistment lie in the parish of Hatherlegh \u2014 namely Horseham, alias Millyam, Blakadoynham, and Blaka don mede ; he has heard this, too, from men older than himself, such as John Parre, his father, eighty years ago, and"], [74, "46 TITHES AND TENNIS AT HATHERLEIGH. John Webber, and Pilstreyte, of Hatherlegh, who lived forty years ago in a tenement near the agistament of Northcote. The miller in the village (as the barber in the town) was always a man of large information, the grist that came to his mill being not merely farinaceous, but colloquial, and there fore his knowledge of parochial matters was naturally extensive. Walter Moreley occupied that popular position at Edesleigh, now more commonly known as Iddesleigh, a little village on the Torridge (from which the late Sir Stafford Northcote took his title), and for forty years had been conversant with parish ways and means, and had, as lessee of the Vicar of Hatherleigh, received tithes from two members of the family of Medland, Richard of Northlew, and Richard of Inwardlegh, when the latter was tenant of the agistment of Northcote. William Colles. who was Mr. Courtis' predecessor had always received those tithes, and he had heard how Thomas Monkley had also paid Mr. Courtis for the tithe of the woods at Northcote, which the Vicar sold to the charcoal burners. \" Every man alyve \" did remember, swore the miller, how this XXd. had been paid for tithes for the last hundred years : he thought the greater part to Inwardlegh, because the greater part of Northcote is situated in that parish. And if you asked Henry Pillstreyt what he thought about this little job, he would tell you that he had followed the pro cession which Parre talked about in Rogation week, and thus he describes it : \u2014 \" The procession of Hatherlegh ever hath goon and zit goth thorowe Blakadon Meyde whyche ys a parcell of North cote, and there and than goyng in procession thorowe the same meyde till for XXX yere agon hath hard old men saye.\" All these that he hath named are in Hatherligh. But why, inquireth counsel, did the parishioners of Hatherligh, in pro cession, always go through that parcel of Northcote called Blakadon Meyde, and not the others. \" Thoy goth in procession from one house to a nother, and so thay go from a certayne house called Waterhouse, therowe Blakadon Mede, whiche is a parcell of Northcote, to a nother house called Marseforde, whiche they culd not do if hit wer within the paryshe of Inwardligh. Ye, and yf hit wer within that paryshe"], [75, "TITHES AND TENNIS AT HATHERLEIGH. 47 the procession of Hatherleigh might leave yt and go a nother way.\" So said also a gentleman of quite another persuasion, or rather trade, even William Rede, who was a very necessary workman in those days of pack-horses and roadsters. He was a pack-saddle maker, born and brought up in the ancient borough, and yet did not stick only or altogether to this, but took a constitutional to Horsham Wood, and helped Monkley and Medland at the carrying of the timber when it was tithed. It certainly went to Hatherleigh Church. All the friends of the Hatherleigh claim were men of mature age, reputable profession, and conspicuous respect ability. Such was Thomas Haside, who was sent by Vicar Courtis to ask Richard Medland, of Inwardlegh, for his tithes, for he went to his house, and as Mr. Medland was out his wife promised to send the money to Hatherlegh, or to Okehampton, which she did within a week, because the Vicar told him so. And how all these little tittle-tattle bits of incidental history assist us now to picture for ourselves the scene. Hayside says that he remembers seeing the parson, Sir Thomas Curtis, equo insidentem, sitting on a horse at the time of the Hatherlegh procession, and \u2014 well, as we have his own words, we will take them : He dyd leede the saide Sir Thomas Curtis, Vicar of Hatherleigh, is horse by the bridlle, because the said Sir Thomas was then sycke and ill at eyse, sayeing, This grounde whiche wee nowe go upon, meanyng Horseham, Millham, Blakadonham, and Blakaden Meyde, parcelles de Northcote, sunt infra fines et limitcs parochie mee de Hatherleigh, for the which I have of the tenaunts of Northcote yerely XXd. This was said in the presence of Thomas Medland, now dead \u2014 (dead indeed in this year of Grace, 1892, some 300 years) \u2014 but the Church remains, and the family of Medland remains, and a good bargain had, however, been made out of the wood which came to Hatherlegh, as one John Beste boasted when he said, in the hearing of the charcoal-burner, Hasyde, I wold I had suche a bargan of woode as I had XXXV yeare ago, in Northcote, to beyld my home agen.

Indeed, it was a nettlish case for John Peyrs, with whose malingering, however, it does not trouble us to have much to say, as he was merely the Uffculme reprobate, of whom not a good word could be said by most of the parishe. The remarkable part of the story is, that when questions of propriety arose in which the above-named Peyrs was called upon to purge himself, a man who had lived there for eight years was expected to swear as to the accommodation which existed in the house where Juliana Mylle lived with her mother. How many \" romes \" where there in her house ? Sanitary Board in those days there was assuredly none ; County Councils were far from any man's wildest Utopia ; every pig could rejoice in his own stye. And dreadfully un healthy must many, nay, most of the country houses, and even country parsonages, have been, in the days when even Kings and Queens had to carry their own feather beds with them, and often lay on hard boards, in their armour, and farthingales. The funny thing about this evidence is, that John Rolonde, of Uffculme, when cross-examined by Peyrs'"], [78, "UFFCULME. 50 counsel as to how he knew Peyrs to be guilty of a certain crime, confessed that \" whether there be mo {i.e., more) chambers in the house than one, he cannot tell \u2014 for the space of twelve moneths.\" A jury of matrons is a formidable bench of justice, and bold would that man be who ventured to dispute or deny their decision, but where there is a decided animus, and a strong prejudice has long existed, the righteousness of their opinion must, of necessity, be considerably discounted. The \" Wallron \" influence was paramount ; he who wished to be at peace with his landlord came and gave evidence as he was told. Roland declared how \"Mr. Wallron caused him to come hither this daye to tell the tructh in this cause!' No wonder ; he was a Wallron tenant ; but how that would enable him to distinguish between \" lawful and unlawful seasons, both be day and be night,\" in which Peyrs and Juliana met together, it is not easy to see. What a precisely proper prudish punctilious mind ! A chance for Vigilance Co. ! He had heard that Peyrs intended \" to make his purgacion \" in the church, and so he came to say what he knew ; but when a question was asked him as to where he spent Thursday night three weeks after Easter last year, he said he could not distinctly remember, but he was ill in his eye ! The fact was, that he owed Peyrs a grudge, and wanted him to be fined heavily for misdemeanour, and so could swear anything. So Uffculme was left in peace.

OERTES the good country folk in North Devon had odd ideas as to their duties in this respect, and partook of what we might call an Hibernian propriety in their idea of kissing, inasmuch as in March, 1540, Joan Fisheley sued William Nycholl for saying that John Lange had kissed her. The colouring of the picture is in pretty lights, and would make a piquant study of country life on canvas, as the eye witnesses gave it. Jacob Paslewe, of Churche Horwoode, was \" in the churche greyne of Horwoode, syttyng upon the crosse, on a feast day, a little after All Saints' Day last, with William Stapledon, William Nycholle, Joane Turner, Walter, and Turner's wiffe,\" when he asked Nycholle : What news from Exeter?

This was a serious and malicious libel on Joan Fysheley. And William Stapledon, Nycholle's mate and chum, could not deny that he had most vehemently, and indeed circum stantially, narrated all that occurred. What it actually was does not concern us.

But then between \"gossip\" in its present use and past, there is not the most distant relationship, any more than thereof necessity is between a buxom woman of the time of the Virgin Queen Bessie and the days of Empress Victoria. In 1560 gossip meant God-parent. In 1560 buxom meant faithful, unimpeachably faithful, and yet why should not it mean, aye, and be, both fat and faithful ? The monotony of such disagreeable and mis chievous scandals had no redeeming element of novelty or ingenuity to recommend them to public notice, much less admiration or imitation.

Another phase of labour is illustrated also \u2014 namely the procedure which was in vogue under the regime of the Courts Christian, when persons charged with any offence against morality had the opportunity of clearing themselves by the evidence of a certain number of the parishioners, and proving an alibi, when they had been brought before the official Ecclesiastical, whose duty it was to inquire into all such gravamina."], [82, "t I f HAT is Cheping Torrington\u2014 rejoicing also in the J \u2014 I \u2014 L attribute of magna or great, to distinguish it from the Small Torrington, where the little Chapel of St. Mary .Magdalen still speaks of the noble founder, John Sentleger \u2014 was not free from iniquitous people and their doings, and as a city set on hill \u2014 as some have thought and indeed said \u2014 being similar to Jerusalem, has stood many a hard siege in its time.

We get a glimpse, however, of a dispute which arose about a will made at Torrington, in 1526, when the Curate of Ted burne St. Mary was brought up to swear what he remembered about the will and the intentions of the testator, Hill. In the presence of Richard Powle, Richard Androo, and John Dawkyn, Sir Richard Warren, priest, wrote out a will by which he left all his goods to his children ; but, added he, \" if alle the children dye, the goods to remayne to a priest to syng for me.\" The question was, how many of the children were alive in 1 541. The priest said that he had himself buried one of the three boys mentioned in the will, in the parish church of Torrington : another is said to have died at Kirton, and therefore the third part of the testator's property belongs to Helenora ; but if all three were dead, and Helenora dead too, the goods would of necessity go to the priest. Report said the children were not dead, but being kept out of the way. By an order which it is now useless to dispute, though we may strongly disprove it, all persons making wills under the direction of the clergy, were to set aside so much of their means to the Church stock, poor box, and other pious purposes, as well as for the maintenance of some masses for their souls.

To the owner and to the clergy the possession of well wooded land or tithes due from woods, whether brushwood or timber, was a serious consideration. Thus it was that at Kenwyn, no less than at Hatherleigh, the vicar stuck up for his share of material or its value, and his action has secured to those who now cut timber on the same land a trustworthy description of the Rouse and Tregellen woods near Truro \u2014 indeed now most probably covered with houses. Tithes, under ordinary circumstances, are a sore trial to the laity, but a parson who was a Triplet \u2014 Martin Triplet, a very unusual person. Yet in his demands of his due share of the Kenwyn woods, the Vicar of Key was merely asking his rights, and when he got hold of Paul Gayler, who had lived in the place for over thirty years, he was in the way of getting excellent information as to real facts. He had known five vicars successively instituted, and also inducted in the parish church of Key : namely, Sir John Ude, Sir William Pedditt, Sir Richard Halse, Sir Peter Barstaple, and Triplets. Vicars Ude and Halse took tithes of Rowse and Trevellen Woods, in the parish of Kenwyn, from one Nich. Panter, who bought it Irom a certain Udy twenty-seven years ago. Then Thomas Trugegen bought Trevellen Wood, which he cleared and paid tithes thereof to Vicar Halse. The Vicar now wished to receive his tithe wood in wood, not cash. William Bennett bought Trevellen Wold from Richard Trevellen, which contained four acres, for i8;\u00a3 sterling.

Not a few antiquarian students make church customs and folk-lore the subject of their enquiries and annotations. To those who have approached Stodleigh Rectory by the pretty road which, turning sharp over the brawling Exe, creeps up through overhanging woods, anynumber of attractions would seem to be in store (so beautiful is the drive and so pleasantly winds the road up to the village on the top of the hill), but a surprise of another nature meets us when we get there, which is to find that the inhabitants of WTarpslegh had even in those late days been to the Court of Rome for a special brief to enable them to enjoy their own masse, &c. That the Italian aggression was by no means resented, and that any good Protestant would have been fatally shocked \u2014 indeed, judging from the last question put, it would look as if doubts had arisen as to the possibility of parishioners coming all the way from Warpslegh with a sound head, but it was nothing more than wet feet or \" breeks \" which they had to fear. But the whole story of the church doings at Stodlegh is so remarkably illustrative of the great vexed questions of the day that we will not spare one word of the two witnesses, Thomas Nott and Henry Raustert. Thomas Nott, as a man of sixty years old, and a regular church-goer, had noted the many changes which marked the course of life even in a quiet village like Stoodleigh, for at that time the personal will of the king was felt in every little chapel of the land when the ukase came down that God's"], [91, "OUR LA YD AY OF WARPSLEGH. 63 devine service was unlawful \u2014 altar and image superstitiously abominable and the symbol of redemption iniquitous and a cursed thing.

What about the Image of the Patron Saint and St. Mary the Virgin ? Have we one ? Yes. There always was, and still is, an image of the Virgin in the Church, and sometimes oblations are made there now, but on account of the Royal injunctions none are made.

The tone of reply is however in each case sufficiently marked to show how bitterly the parishioners resented three things : Royal and Erastian interference and domination in things Spiritual, neglect of duty in their parson, and unaffec tionate disregard for all the rights of their own church.

And yet another interest is attached to these very words of the old people in the good old times \u2014 that of the English language and words they used, and the way they used them, and the meaning they attached to them. These minor points cannot be noted as trivial and childish, because the diction of the Engish Bible has been acknow ledged by all English historians and poets as the storehouse of English idiom and English oratory, and in these very days was translated.

More fearful of prophecy at home than of his adversary in combat abroad, Sir John, who fled from his ill-omened seat of Efford to escape his promised death on the sands of Stratton, only to fall mortally wounded on the shore between Marazion and St. Michael's Mount (when, as Sheriff of Cornwall, he attacked the Earl of Oxford, then holding the Castle against the king) \u2014 this Sir John Arundell set his descendants an example which none were slow to follow in deeds of prowess.

He signs himself thus \u2014 \" per me, Johanncm A rundell de Trerys, junior', and says that on Sept. 23rd, 1541, he was twenty-eight years of age, and had lived at Trerise ten years. Just for this period he had known the two parties in a suit of very little importance to anyone but themselves, but in which Mr. John Arundell seemed to have strong views. One of these, the plaintiff, was Melhuishe, a servant ; the other was one Joane Hore, a sort of lady-help or housekeeper. The company in which we now find ourselves was nothing of higher rank than what was described in legal terms as servieus or serf, possibly domestic servants ; and the house in which this scene is laid is not Trerice, but the manor house of Gwarnike, in the parish of St. Allen (or as it is here spelt Alunne), and it came into the hands of the Arundells in this way. The male line of Beville (another honorable family in Cornwall) became extinct after ten descents, and when one of the co-heiresses married into the family of Arundell of Trerice she brought with her the manor of Gwarnike. So John Arundell says he was asked by Mr. Arundell to to be his messenger in this matter, and accordingly he did fetche Mr. Metros and Joane Hore to his house within the parish of Alunne, and then Mr. Arundell did reteyne Mr. Metros to be a counsell with the said Joane Hore, and did give him his fees there in a parlare within the house \u2014 viz., a piece of gold and a certen Whit money.\" Thomas Nycholle, of Truro, was Mr. Arundell's counsel also. But much of the interest of this unimportant suit turns on a man in the establishment called James Willharry, who was in the establishment el stipendiarius ; possibly that means in in his regular pay, or a pensioner (could he have been his jester?) \u2014 he apparently had either really or feignedly all the qualifications for a fool. In truth, Arundell, junior, of Trerise, describes him as vere stolidus \u2014 really stupid, unable to live without him \u2014 presumably without his master's support, on account of his lack of discretion. But how could Mr. Arundell"], [98, "LLFE BELOW THE SALT AT TRERISE. 70 know this ? Why, said he, \" he can nott tell XX. pens, but that none of them will say anythinge that shall make agen hym for feare lest they should have his displeasure, and Mr. A. savers this cause so earnestlie that they will not saye any thynge agenst Hore, and that he caused his own son to execute the precepts of this course agaynste Melhuysh ? In fact, he was what they called about Ashprington a \" frentyke and a bedlyme (Bedam !) fellow.\" But that this Joan Hore (whoever she might be) had great influence with Arundell, of Trerice, is clear, for the last declaration of Young Arundell was that she is his household servant, and hath all the Rente of his place of Treryse. You might ask anybody what they thought of James Willharry, and they would tell you that John Chitton, of St. Anne's, Exeter, was quite justified in describing him verus Ideota \u2014 a man of no discretion, in fact he is a pauper \u2014 a vile, churl, and common fellow, and frequently drunk and of no credence. Chitton thus described his mental condition, and then goes on to say \" he hath wroght with hym in tynworke dyverse tymes, and so hath sene hym and knowen hym, and hath hard men say so.\" But Nycholle, who came from Truro put a spoke some what awkwardly in here, for Mr. Arundell had said in his hearing that he would make Melhuyshe marry unto Joane Hore if the Lawe will so judge hit or ells hit shuld cost him Xh\u00a3. Joane was in need of a husband, and much as Melhuyshe objected, and staunchly as he denied any contract, Mr. Arundell was resolved that she should marry him. This was somewhat hard on Melhuishe, but we must remember that in old days no man could live or die without the consent of the Lord of the Manor \u2014 neither could a man marry his family off or change his house without permission, nor could his sons take holy orders. Thus, if Mr. Arundell of Trerice determined that Melhuyshe should marry Joane Hore, marry her he must ; and you must remember that the Arundells came over with the Conqueror William, so that the old feudal customs of the Normans extended even to their scullions and kitchen-maids ; aye, and dishwashers."], [99, "$.

The clergy, indeed, became the laughing stock of the laity, and furnished stock subjects for every ribald song and joke which was bandied about from ale-house to stall, and market to barber, throughout town and village. One elegant and savoury story of this sort had been tumbling about Exeter for some little time when Augustin Crutcherd, who lived in St. David's parish, outside Northgate, chanced to be in the house of Mr. Layke, in St. Paul's parish, on a certen workeday about Myghelmas, 1541, when he \u2014 Layke \u2014 was playing at the tabills, gestynge uppon prests.

A disposition to shew kindness to the clergy, and appreciation of their abilities, surely there can be nothing wrong in this. No ; but even in modern times a Curate has been taken with a milk cart in the same paryshe ; and clergy have been charged with offences which they could not have committed. The fact is that the very position and its duties and assumption challenge criticism, and ever have done so, and when no better scandal is afloat, it is not difficult to excite one on persons or things ecclesiastical. Thus one Berrie had a wife against whom no one could so much as breathe a suspicion of slander, but because she had offered a foolish wench \" a kirtill and a pettycoat \" to leave her house, she was to be talked of all over the town.

But another citizen of some credit was mixed up with this affair who lent respectability to the whole transaction, and looked upon such reports as serious blemishes on social propriety, and as such to be punished.

It does not appear that this amicable proposal led to any practical or peaceable solution of the difficulty, for within two years the same parties met again at the same place, before the same president, and on May 13th (1541), William Crooke, substitute of the Dean Rural of Cadbury, brought into court a certain mandate from the Consistorial Court of the Bishop, certifying that he had cited John Howe in person, and apprehended him at his usual place of residence a week ago, and that the case was to proceed, and certain witnesses be produced on behalf of the Vicar and Dean.

The Dean's case was apparently supported by some ten in habitants of the town or neighbourhood, whose custom could scarcely be contradicted, as it was independently corroborated in each particular. Amongst these came William Toocker, who, having lived in the parish of Crediton 40 years, had always cut his broom on a certain fundus prope Phynytedborne and paid the tithe to Mr. John Phylippe, the Dean, and at another time to Mr. Grove, also Dean ; about nine years ago he also had paid to another Dean.

Asked whether he knew that some others paid these tithes, he replied he did not know what others did about tithing, neither was he so curious as to enquire about other people 's business, but he had never heard of any controversy as to their payment. John Ley's recollection did not carry him back quite so far as his \" precontests,\" but he remembered seeing Robert Ley, his father, cut his broom in villa de Holcombe, and did carrye upon a wayne a hunderth brome for the tenth unto Mr. John Philippe, then beynge Dean of Kirton, saynge unto the said Mr. Deane, Mayster, I have broght home youre broome here. And Mr. Deane did paye him for the cuttinge and for the carynge. He himself knew many who paid these tenths to the modern Dean, such as William Tooker, John Flood, John Sowden, John Pridam, and John Mogridge.

And to this John Flood agreed, who had cut much broom growing in a certain farm called Harford, where the Dean took a hundredth for his tithe, but acknowledged that if the broom was kept at home and used at home, no tithes were due.

The betrothing part of the business was simple enough.

As for Atwoode and Hill a little too much was known of them, and the pleasant complimentary title of Mediator was translated otherwise by Mr. Walter Soper, of Bridestowe, who had seen both these gentlemen in uncomfortable circumstances. All the countree saith that he ys a broker in alle courtes spirituall and temporal!. As for Hill \u2014 Well of his own knowledge he is a man who will bere false wittness with anyone for the value of XI Id. What, one bob for a lie ! Soper thinketh that the speche of the countree is a fair criterion of a man's character, and that his two friends, Furse man and Henry Adams, of Mylton and Lamerton, are worthy of all credit when they say that Andrew Hill was ones per juredc, and did beare false wittnes in a cause of matrimonye betwixt John Cragge and a woman of Southpederwyn in Cornwall, and for that thay wer both \u2014 Cragge and Hille \u2014 set in the stokes. So, so Mr. Cragge \u2014 this little affair with Miss Alson Badcock was not your first essay at lady killing. Indeed only the very last Sunday before Ash Wednesday, at Lamerton, in Elizabeth Furseman, ys house, Hill had acknowledged that he never heard any words of matrimony pass between Cragge and Alson. Cragge's mother too was not to be believed, for some four years ago her mind gave way. And now the truth gradually leaks out. Alson Badcocke was really a catch, or the Craggs hoped her parents would bribe John off, and pay for anything to get her out of the proceedings, for it happened that on the second Sunday in last Lent, as John Chubbe, of Broad woode wygeger (!) was standing outside Richard Craggs door, John Craggs father, that Richard said to him : Chubbe, I must desyre the to do a thing for me. What ys't ? replied Chubbe . My son John hathe maed a bargan of matrymonye with badcockes doghter, and now she forsayes hit.

This Chubbe, as an honest man, could not do, for, as he said, he was not present at the betrothal and knew nothing at all about it. He supposed that Cragg meant he should be well rewarded for speaking false wittness and perjury from the way he spoke, though he did not say so in so many words. And then, as if all chance of Andrew Hill's having a particle of orthodox respectability left about him was to be taken away, who should come into court but his own brother in-law, John Horwill, of Currington, alias Coryton, a village about three miles off, a threescore old mischief maker, who had the affrontery to say that Androo is a very poor fellow, and not able to kepe house by himself (though this by the way is generally considered as the legitimate plea of the wealthy bachelor), and that he dwells with one Richards, in the paryshe of Mylton, which Richard's brother namede ? Roberte Richard hath married with one Agnes Cragge, and therefore Horwill belyveth that Androo did depose contrarye to his conschyens and other ways than the truth was bycause heys not hable to lyve bisyde the same Richard. In fact, he had so little discretion that his father had disinherited him, and wolde that he shuld have no parte of his goods but such goods as his brother John Hill wolde reward him withall.

HE limits of the Forest of Dartmoor, extending as it V^ does, over 56,000 acres, have always furnished food for discussion and debate since the days of the Druids and Ordulph. The parishes which adjoin, and, in fact, extend on to the moor, such as Buckfastleigh, Widecombe, and Dean Prior, were in an anomalous position of uncertainty, and when tithes be came the questio vexata argument became hot, and language strong, various anomalies of custom prevailing which nothing but primitive use can explain or justify. Thomas Hamlynge(a variation for the familar old name of Hamelin, more generally spelt Hamlyn) on this matter called on Mr. Page, the Vicar of Buckfastleigh, in i53i,by request, be cause Page had heard that, he, Hamlyn, had leased the tithes of wool from Mr. Shilston, then Rector of Lidford, who had obtained a citation againt his parishioners at Buckfastleigh, on account of the tithe wooll of sheep feeding and wandering in le forest of Dartmore. The Vicar when asked for these tithes said : I am bounde to paye no tythe wooll to the parson of Lid forde noder zit none of my parryshioners. To which Hamlynge replied : Than will I acite your parryshioners to appeyre before my lorde busshopp's officers to shew a cause why the}- shall not paye hit. Now the Vicar would not knuckle under, but being an aged man he said : I ame an olde man, and I can nott well labore nowe, and I wold Rader agree with the thane thou shulde trobille my parryshioners."], [122, "DIFFICULTIES ON DARTMOOR. 94 I am contentide so that you will offere me anything reasonable.

Hamlyn, however, kept on saying : \u2014 I will take none but in the name of tithes. The Vicar kept on saying : \u2014 I will pay no thing but of my goode will. Eventually the Vicar paid 5s. a year by his chaplain, one Pynhaye for three years, but at time of his death was \" much behynde.\" One thing Hamlyn was quite sure of, \" he hath seyn the kyng's auditors pay the sum of 5s. in the nayme of barbage for the more of Dartmore.\" But none save Page had ever before or since received such tithes. They belonged to the parish of Lidford. The information which John Vosey (or Voysy), was able to give was interesting, as he was constantly in the Stannary Courts and knew all about the limits and bounds of Lidford parish. Wyndyatt, an important factor in these differences, was, as he knew, a parishioner of Lidford, but received Sacraments and Sacramentalls at Wydecumb, by an old composition and agreements between the Rector of Lidford and the Vicar of Wydecumb : He and all his neighbours at Dunridge are generally accounted parishioners of Lidford all the same. So Quynt also belongs to Lidford parish, and Drew as well pays tithe of wool and herbage. The King's foresters and bailiffs had also told him that all who lived in Wydecumb parish paid their dues, both predial and personal, to the Rector of Lidford, though they attend Widecumb Church, because the nearest of the parishioners is eight or nine miles from Lidford Church.

They are called by name, thus : John Wyndyatt, John Quynte, John Edmonds and Rob. Drew\u2014 \"of the parish of Lidford.\" When also, as was usual, these forenamed parishioners paid mortuaries to the Vicar of Widecumbe by a composition between the two clergy, you would imagine that the Vicar would be prepared at all times to bury those who paid these dues, but about 30 years ago, Mr. Brusye, Vicar of Wyde combe declined and altogether refused to bury certain dead bodies, namely, those of William Hodge and John Welmot, who lived in Dartmoor forest, because he said they did not belong to his parish, though they actually were in the habit of receiving sacramentals in Wydecumbe Church, and paid tithes of lambs and quarterly offerings. They were buried at Lidford. Wyndyatt's grievance was that he had been repulsed from the number of the twelve men or jury, duodccim pro rege, but Drew was detected on the Sunday before Michaelmas in taking money from the inhabitants of Wridecumbe which belonged by right to the Rector of Lidford, and to his Church. Subsequently the enquiry was continued in November, 1539, before Mr. Blaxton, when John Elys, of Buckfastleigh, said that he remembered having a foal to tithe, and that he paid what was due to the Rector of Lydford, and that Robert Wyndiatt received it as proctor, while John Quyint said that when he tithed the wool of his sheep, feeding in the forest of Dartmoor and Kingsmore, he paid it to the Rector of Lidford, but the tithe of lambs to the Vicar of Wydecombe : this he paid to John Geyre, Shilstan's deputy, and to Robert Drew, lessee of the present Rectory sheaf. The evidence of John Edmonds was to the effect that he knew the customs of tithe payment, because he always went and paid the Rector of Lydford or his proctor, Sir John Shilston when the animals were \u2014 as the custom was \u2014 \" con gregated \" all together ad Dondridgepole on the moor. He was not sure, but thought, that the parishioners of Dean Prior and Buckfastleigh did the same, but Robert Drue certainly remembered receaving upon litle estre Sundaye, six yeres ago, of one Thomas Hamlyn, than beynge procter and fermor with him to the parson of Lidforde, I Is.

John Pulsford was one of the oldest inhabitants, and knew that for forty years two tenements called Hutchings and Cul lings place had paid this charge. The ancient custom used in the parish, from time imme morial, was that the possessor of every tenement, whether thay be cots or placys, and that every tenant place holder or cotyers ar bonde to fynde for every suche cote or place, when yt comyth to there course a farthynge breede to make holy breede off and a ob (\u00a3d.) to by bread, and wyne to synge with alle.

But what William meant by such words he knoweth not ; but he had heard Joane refusing to marry William about three months before. William was XX^ richer than Joane, but he thinketh that Joane shall at length be equall unto William in goods and substance ; but he was only sixteen years of age, and she twelve, when they were thus betrothed.

A story, however, had reached his ears from Tomasina, Shaw's wife, who said that the very morning of the betrothal, very early indeed, at dawn, William Foot came to her house crying bitterly, and saying that his parents would force him to marry Joane, and Margaret, wife of John Cowle, also of Hartland, said that to please her husband she threatened and coaxed Joane Prieste, and beguiled her thus : Say after Hew Prieste whatsoever he bids the saye. If thou shalt marie with this young felowe Foote, or ells thou shall goo as no man ys chyld shall goo. And if thou doo marie with hym and applye the selff to love hym thou shalt lak no thyng. But Joan's consent could not be obtained \u2014 though after such a threat it was only the best policy to say : Well, I may speke the woordes, but I will never marie with hym so long as I live. And what was Foot's fortune, lands in hand ? 10s. and other goods 20^, by hearsay."], [133, "jBnrhlanh JSpuap. 1540 ONE laudable and immemorial custom in the parish of Buckland Bruere has ever been \u2014 at least, so swore Nicholas Dennys, generosus, i.e., a gentleman, who had lived forty years there, ever since he was four years old \u2014 that by the unanimous consent of the four parts of the parish and their inhabitants four honest {probi) men should be chosen with right authority and power to tax every parishioner what was to be paid for each house for the common use and works and fabric of the Church.

This custom and order has always received the consent of the parishioners inviolabiliter until now, when William Drew \u2014 called otherwise \" Cardrew \" \u2014 has refused to pay a measure of oats and half a bushell of wheat for his two tenements. A schedule was produced of the rate, which John Medyn, an old parishioner of sixty years, John Wring, one of the \" four honest men of Buckland Brure,\" and John John, senior, seventy years old, agreed was justly drawn according to every man's proper portion and holding \u2014 the last adding that without all malice, hatred, or love, the rate was levied on the parishioners ; if they, any of them, came into an increase of wealth, they were rated on the higher scale, and if they came down to poverty on the lesser and lower scale.

The compromising facts which now generally give the injured lassie the more substantial damages by way of plaster for an irreparable loss have not in any in stance in this county, at this period, cast a shadow of reproach on the chivalry of the medieval gallants of Damnonia- In the neighbouring counties it was otherwise as at Wotton Phippyn, in the Diocese of Sarum now commonly known as Wootton Fitzpaine. William Sampson, however, brought damning evidence against himself when he sent for his neighbour, Richard Barcumbe, to William Sprack's house, and said : Goodeman Barcumbe, I have causede you to cum hither bycause I wolde desyre you to ber wittnes in a cause of matri monye betwixt this woman, Joane Smyth, and me, and bicause I have myseused here I intende to make a goode woman, there for I desyre you to betroght usse.

(Possibly a cheap alternative.) Talk of bargens, why 10s. apiece was certainly not a high price for the quartett by which Sampson had enriched the census of Wotton Phyppyn. Nor was that the end of the case ; for another young woman had a vested interest in the strong man ; and, if her uncle, John Bryan, was to be believed, he had been present a fortnight before Whitsuntide last past, in Sampson's house, whither he had been asked to come by John Bryne, the father of Agnes Bryne, when, after a lot of words about matrimony, he had betrothed them, using a shorter but more solemn form of words, preserved indeed, as they now are \u2014 in a fashion \u2014 in the explanatory exhortation given by the Priest to the couple about to be married (which is indeed part of the ancient order of the Espousals). I, William, take thee, Agnes, to my wiffe, before God and man ; an expression which we do not often meet with in these narratives. There were then present, Thomas, Arthur, and William Danworthie, and it was not until two days ago (it was then Nov. 13, 1539,) that he heard how Sampson had pre contracted matrimony with Joane Smythe, and that she, though he did not know her personally, doth laye a clacme unto William S. So then public report \" labors \" at Mem bury that William and Agnes are man and wife ; and at Wrotton Phyppyn that William and Joane are man and wife also ; so that it was high time that the course of this uxorius ainnis should be stopped.

The elegance and veracity of her imagination were as con spicuous as the Eiffel Tower, and (thinking of exhibitions) none was more straightforwardly universal than that one set up in a certain form of words in a certain portion of Morton Hampstead parish, called Yolewoordye, in June, 1539, where John Potter, of Chagford, and Richard Boddye, of Morton, heard her placing the names of Agnes Yolden and Alice Farwell in an undesirable association of scandalous conduct with those of Sir Thomas Lowdon, the prieste, and Harrye Crocker and Joane Robyns. Suffice it to say that Joane Robyns was like Katherine Pansford, of Crediton, against whom Richard Helliar had brought some very severe charges about the same date : bona, a good woman ; honesta, a respectable woman ; fidclis, a buxom woman \u2014 that is faithful to her husband, and fide digna a woman as good as her word.

The worst of it was, that though William Burges had known Father Belamy some twenty-six years, the acquaintance had not been productive of that affectionate respect which would naturally debar a young parishioner from singing skits about his spiritual adviser all over the parish, but Bill Burges's own confession was to the effect that he had read all the charges brought against the composer of a certain well-known song, and the song itself as scheduled in the indictment (he, or the notary, rather, calls it famosa ilia cancio). Wralter Kyne he knew to be the composer thereof, or to have helped to make it ; he had told him so ; in fact they had made it together. Here is a Tudor sample of Gilbert and Sullivan all over again. Divided honors ; joint authorship ; and, in this case, joint damages.
