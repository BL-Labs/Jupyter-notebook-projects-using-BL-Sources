A Work, in the shape of letters, under the title of \" Italy, and the Italians in the Nineteenth Century,1' was published three years ago, in one volume, octavo, and a very limited edition taken off, which was, in great measure, confined to the subscribers. A fire, which occurred soon after in the printer's warehouse, destroyed the remaining copies. The work, however, was favourably no ticed by several periodicals, and approved of by many readers ; and this has encouraged me to submit it again to the public in its present enlarged and amended shape. Fondly attached to the country where I passed my early years, \u2014 a country celebrated for its beau ties and for its misfortunes, \u2014 I feel a desire to make its inhabitants better known to British readers; and I think I am placed in a situation rather favourable for this purpose. Acquainted from my infancy with the language and manners of the"], [12, "PREFACE. VI Italians \u2014 brought up under their sky \u2014 nursed in their homes \u2014 I quitted that country before early impressions could ripen into prejudices, and at that period of life when the powers of the mind begin to expand. Circumstances, connected with the affairs of the time, having induced me to leave the continent, I joined what I considered the common cause of mankind, against a system of ruthless and gigantic oppression ; and, during a period of several years spent in some of the most interesting countries of Europe, a variety of scenes, of manners, and of people, afforded me ample means of comparison. After the last peace, I returned to the land of my childhood : I found every thing altered, and myself almost a stranger in my own country. I wandered then about Italy, adding fresh information to old recollections ; and from both, I now exhibit a sketch, I hope not altogether uninteresting. It has not been so much the material part of Italy, \u2014 that is to say, its antiquities, ruins, and buildings, which have been so often described by abler pens than mine, \u2014 as the moral state of its in habitants, that has engrossed my attention. I think the Italians are but imperfectly known, and often unjustly abused: they are generally included by"], [13, "PREFACE. VII foreigners in one common description of character, while, in fact, the inhabitants of the various states of that much divided country form so many distinct nations. A Tuscan and a Neapolitan, a Lombard and a Genoese, a Venetian and a Roman, are as different from one another, as the Germans are from the English, or the Dutch from the French. Well acquainted with the religion of Italy, I have spoken of it with respect, and I hope also with impartiality : I have endeavoured to draw the line between its avowed tenets as they are explained from the pulpit and from the chairs of theology, and the abuses which popular ignorance and credu lity have ingrafted upon them. I feel convinced, besides, that in all the divisions of Christianity the same virtues are to be found ; they all trust in the same promises, and entertain the same hopes ; they all acknowledge the same Book and the same Teacher ; and from all the different Christian temples, the same prayers and wishes are daily wafted towards Heaven. I ardently wish the mild and truly Christian principle of toleration to be generally diffused among brethren, whatsoever be the forms of their worship. This spirit of charity constitutes the happy medium between fanaticism"], [14, "VIII PREFACE. and incredulity, both of which are destructive of the best feelings of man. I have noticed the subject of Italian politics in a general sense, abstaining as much as possible from party questions, and endeavouring to be as impar tial as a human being can, who courts no smiles and fears no frowns. A friend to rational liberty, I have been taught by experience to mistrust and fear that mania for violent changes, and those schemes of perfectibility, which have in our times deluged Europe with blood, and filled it with misery. A revolution is, at best, but an exchange of the certain for the uncertain ; and nothing but a state of intolerable oppression, which fortunately is very rare in modern times, should reconcile an honest man to so doubtful a chance. In a little work I published some time since *, I have treated more particularly the subject of party spirit on the continent. My principles have been criticised by some, who, I suspect, have misunder stood me. I have blamed the exaggerations of what is called the ultra-liberal party, and have pointed out the wrong tendency of liberalism in general ; * Considerations on the State of the Continent since the General Peace. 1 Vol. Svo.

I think they have been mistaken ; that they wanted too much ; that although anxious to do good, they set about it the wrong way ; and the result has been, for the present, an increase of evil, from which however some good may ultimately result. Since the publication of the first work, I have visited Italy again, in 1821 and in 1822, and spent some time in those parts of the country which were the seat of the political convulsions of 1820 and 1821. I have given an impartial sketch of those events, (confining myself to facts,) from materials collected on the spot. Other parts of the work I have either re-written or considerably altered. I have corrected hasty judgments, or facts not sufficiently authenticated. Three or four years, which have passed over my head since the first publication, have modified, in some instances, my view of things, although my principles remain the same. I have expatiated upon the monuments of the middle ages, which are to be found, especially at Naples, because this was a ground that had been less trodden upon than that of classical antiquities."], [16, "X PREFACE. I have bestowed particular attention upon the two principal Italian monarchies, Naples and Sardinia, as these are by far the most important and influen tial among the native states, by the extent of their territories, their population, and resources. Venice is the only great Italian city I have not spoken of, because I have not visited it. It happens, however, that this omission is amply supplied by many other travellers, who have described Venice with the greatest accuracy. \" Les Italiens (says Madame de Stael) sont plus remarquables par ce qu'ils ont ete et par ce qu'ils pourroient etre, que par ce qu'ils sont maintenant.\" Assenting, as I do, to this general proposition of that illustrious writer, still I think that the Italians are, even now, remarkable and interesting in many respects, and deserve more attention than the gene rality of travellers seem inclined to bestow upon them. Italy is still the land of genius and enthu siasm, and many warm and generous hearts are to be found under its glowing sky.

XI Naples, Tuscany, Lombardy, Piedmont, and Ge noa. I have crossed the Alps by the two most celebrated roads, the Simplon and the Mont Cenis ; and I have made several voyages along the delight ful shores of the Mediterranean sea, and in sight of its numerous islands. In the present publication I have introduced whole descriptive chapters, the materials of which were taken during my last journey. I have also added, at the end of the first ATolume, an historical sketch of the various Governments in the North of Italy under the French, which may prove a useful reference to those who wish to be able to understand the present tone of political feeling in that country. I have followed the course of events, and have availed myself of the most impartial authorities, and particularly of a well-written Italian work which appeared last year in Switzerland, under the title DelF Amministrazione del Regno cF Italia sotto i Francesi. At the end of the work I have added a treatise on Modern Literature. To give a complete view of Italian literature would require volumes, and years of labour. This subject has been already treated by Ginguene and Sismondi. I have contented"], [18, "PREFACE. XII myself with giving an account of the most dis- tinguished authors of the last and present cen- turies, in order to afford a guide to those who would become acquainted with their writings. I have consulted for this treatise, Italian authorities, and, with regard to some writers of the last century, the recent and excellent work of Count Ugoni, Della Letteratura Italiana, to which I feel myself indebted. . I think I may say upon the whole, that the present work has several new features which dis tinguish it from other travels. The author of this book being a foreigner, although several years a resident in England, inaccuracies of language and exoticisms of style must be left to the indulgence of the English reader. It is a very difficult, if not a hopeless, task for a stranger, even after a long residence in England, to acquire the idiom of the country so as to write as fluently as a native. Having said thus much, I commit myself to that liberality which is so characteristic of the British public. A. V."], [19, "CONTENTS. VOL. I.

CHAPTER I. ARRIVAL IN ITALY. A HE generality of travellers, who proceed to Italy, enter that country from the North, by the great roads which cross the Alps. They visit North Italy first, and then proceed to the Southern States. On my return to Italy, after an absence of many years, I happened to enter it from the South, being landed at Naples, which is the most considerable, and in many respects the most remarkable, city of the Italian Peninsula ; while it is, at the same time, the most remote as well as the most dissimilar from the other European capitals. A very essential distinction exists between the North and the South of Italy ; and the impressions produced on the mind of the traveller, who arrives at once at Naples by sea, are totally different from Vot. I. B"], [24, "2 DIVISION OF ITALY. those experienced by the tourist, who, travelling first from France or Germany to the half ultramontane states of Piedmont and Lombardy, becomes by de grees, as it were, Italianised, before he reaches Rome and Naples, which two countries comprise the true classical ground of Italy. Considered in a material, as well as in a moral, point of view, Italy presents two great divisions, between which the chain of the Apennines forms the natural boundary. The main ridge of these mountains traces an irregular line from west to east, beginning at Cuneo and Tende, where it joins the chain of the maritime Alps, it runs along the Ge noese coast, continues through the dutchies of Parma and Modena, which it separates from Tus cany, and then proceeds in a south-eastern di rection through the Roman states, until it reaches the shores of the Adriatic, in the province of An cona, on the frontiers of Abruzzi. There, a conti nuation of the same chain branches off to the South, through the whole length of the Neapolitan states. Under the denomination of North Italians must be classed all those who inhabit the whole of the fine regions which lie to the north of the Apen nines, and between them, the Alps and the Adriatic sea; including, therefore, the states of Piedmont, Lombardy, Venice, Parma, Piacenza, and Modena, and the papal provinces of Ferrara, Bologna, and"], [25, "north and south. 3 Romagna. The greater part of these states forms, as it were, one immense plain, through which the river Po flows from west to east. That river, as well as the Adige, which is next to it in magnitude, and all the other streams of North Italy, empty themselves into the Adriatic. South Italy begins ort the opposite side of the Apennines, and is enclosed between them and the Mediterranean, the Ionian, and part of the Adri atic seas. It includes, therefore, Tuscany, the greater part of the Papal states, and the whole kingdom of Naples. The difference is great between the appearance of the country, the nature of the soil, the climate, and the inhabitants of these two divisions. The beau tiful, though mostly unhealthy, shores of the Me diterranean, from La Spezia to the extremity of Calabria, belong evidently to one region, the fea tures of which are totally distinct from those of the magnificent plateau, which extends from the source of the Po to the mountains of Friuli, and from the Swiss Alps to the Apennines of Tuscany and Ancona. In all this extent there is no ele vation which deserves the name of a mountain. It is in the Southern division that we find the true classical ground of Italy,\u2014 the land of anti quities, and of mighty recollections, \u2014 the land of the fine arts. It is chiefly to the South that belong the B 2"], [26, "4 CHARACTERISTICS. romantic scenes described by poets and travellers ; \u2014 the beautiful moonlight nights,\u2014 the glowing azure of the sky, \u2014 the dark blue sea, \u2014 the purple tinged mountains, \u2014 the forests of orange, lemon, and olive trees. There you find men lawless and impassioned; and female beauty, Soft as her clime and sunny as her skies. There the landscapes of Salvator Rosa, and the Ma donnas of Raphael, had originals in nature. There Pergolesi, Cimarosa, and Paisiello were inspired. The wonders of Michel Angelo, the temple of St. Peter, as well as the Coliseum and the Pan theon, are there to be found. It is the country of Dante, of Macchiavelli, and of Tasso; it was the birth-place of Scipio, of C\u00e6sar, and of Cicero. The North of Italy is the country of plenty, \u2014 Jess poetical, but better cultivated. It has also its recol lections of glorious deeds and great men, although of a more recent date and less imposing aspect. It has produced Doria, Titian, Corregio, Ari osto, Alfieri, and Canova. The North has given the best soldiers; the South the keenest poli ticians. The southern painters excel in the genius of composition and in the boldness of design ; the northern ones, in the delicacy and warmth of tints, and in the softness of outlines. The architecture of the South is colossal and imposing ; that of the North is more finished and convenient."], [27, "SCENERY. 5 The scenery of the two countries is not less varied. The North is, for the greater part, a fertile plain, watered by abundant rivers, divided into well cultivated fields and gardens; full of towns and villages, inhabited by a numerous and indus trious race. The landscape is luxuriant but mo notonous; \u2014 roads wide, level, and straight; never ending avenues of trees: the misty glimpse of the distant Alps and Apennines is the only thing that relieves the sleepy dulness of the scene. In the South, on the contrary, the landscape varies every twenty miles. There are to be seen delights ul valleys, surrounded by stupendous crags; \u2014 torrents fear fully swelled at one time of the year, and rolling their foaming waters with the noise of thunder, and at other seasons reduced to scanty rivulets, bubbling over the pebbles of their rocky beds; \u2014 wide, uncul vated plains, strewed with ruins of former great ness, inhabited by wild buffaloes, and wilder men; \u2014 and in the midst of these, the proudest city in the world lifting its melancholy head. Farther inland are seen ruinous castles and towers perched upon almost inaccessible peaks, among beautiful forests of chesnut-trees and wild solitary glens. More to the South, the rich plains of Campania and of Apulia ; the lovely shores of Parthenope, encircled by the frowning Apennines, which rise bolder and higher and wilder as they extend further south,"], [28, "6 INHABITANTS. until, at last, being narrowly confined between the two seas, they invade the whole breadth of the Peninsula, and heap their dark summits in the province of Calabria. There, at the extremity of Italy, exists a race of men little known to the rest of Europe, and as savage as the inhabitants of the opposite coast of Albania; living in an almost pri mitive state: full of uncultivated genius; ignorant, but intelligent; individually courageous, but un ruly, ferocious, and impatient of discipline ; faith ful to their friends, but revengeful to the last against their enemies; capable of the darkest, as well as of the most heroic, deeds. The Italians of the North have less of those peculiar features which mark the fallen descendants of ancient Rome. They resemble more their neigh bours, the French, Swiss, and Germans, with whom they have been long in contact, and from whom they have imbibed habits of greater comfort, of artificial luxury, of social discipline. They are of tamer manners ; their ideas are more on a level with those of the rest of Europe ; they have more the features of a modern nation, and are more likely to form one; they have in short the good and the bad qualities of modern civilized Europe. The Italians of the South (with the exception of Tuscany in some respects) are yet much behind in modern improvements, or modern refinement. They"], [29, "FLORENCE, ROME, AND NAPLES. 7 have more characteristic traits of their own to dis tinguish them from other nations; they have more of the personal independence of half civilized people, although living under absolute govern ments ; they have stronger passions, but they have also greater enthusiasm for the beautiful, especially in the works of art and music. South Italy is essen tially the country of painting and of song. In the midst of this magic land rise three great cities, the resorts of the traveller, \u2014 all three beautiful and famed, although each of them totally different from the other two. Florence, the city of Italian society, Italian urbanity and elegance, and also of polite literature. Rome, the city of monuments, of religious pomp and splendour, and of the arts ; the seat also of a certain solemnity and dignity which is more peculiarly her own, and becomes her name and former state. Naples, at last, gay and thought less, the city of voluptuousness, the siren of Italy, the spoiled favourite of a too bountiful nature, the seat of epicurism mixed with some degree of Greek refinement ; the country of the senses, but the coun try also of imagination. I have compared the impressions which Naples has produced upon me in all my frequent visits to it, at various and very different periods, with those felt by other travellers, with whom I have con versed on the subject in distant scenes and after a"], [30, "8 ATTRACTIONS OF NAPLES. lapse of time ; and I have found the results to have been nearly the same : \u2014 surprise at first arriving ; delight at the scenes of nature, mixed with a sort of vague reverie as if such scenes were unreal, for at times they look as such ; disgust at the moral features of the place. The fancy and the senses are interested, but not the heart nor the intellect. One leaves this place without regret, and yet remembers it always with a wish to see it once more. One becomes loath of a residence in Naples, and yet cannot think of forsaking it altogether. A sort of spell in the climate charms the stranger, and makes him forget dearer and better things. Many foreigners who came to Naples for a short time, have at last fixed their residence, and lived and died in it, unable to break the charm. When I have talked to them on the subject, I found them per fectly agreed with regard to the disadvantages of the place; but yet the climate, they said, \u2014 nature \u2014 made up for all other things ; and thus they slept away their existence in the arms of the enchantress. To the attention of the curious, the intelligent, and the philosophical traveller, however, Naples has higher claims. It is the third capital in Christian Europe for population : its inhabitants amount to four hundred thousand. It is the first for its situation, the strangest by its contrasts, and the only one built at the foot of a terrible volcano."], [31, "9 ATTRACTIONS OF NAPLES. The richness and fertility of its territory are won derful. The penetration and fiery imagination of its inhabitants are equally great, and still less cultivated. Of all the sciences or arts one really may be said to flourish at Naples, and that one is music. To the historian, Naples abounds in recollections connected with the general history of Europe. To the invalid, \u2014 to the man tired of social disputes and political strife, Naples offers a choice of delightful, quiet, and salubrious retreats. Such is this famed metropolis."], [32, "10 CHAPTER II. N^VPLES. I arrived at Naples in a vessel from Malta ; our passage was short and pleasant. We sailed along the eastern coast of Sicily, and saw Mount Etna, that formidable volcano, covered with eternal snow, and which the Sicilians emphatically describe as V Arciprete de' monti ehe in cotta bianca, al Ciel porge gl' incensi : the high priest of the mountains, who, in his white surplice, offers incense to heaven. We passed the Faro of Messina, and admired the beautiful situation of that city and the fine view of the extreme ridge of the Apennines, which termi nates the Italian peninsula.* We passed the Lipari islands, close by Stromboli; saw, at night, the flames of that singular volcano rising in a conical form * On one hand beam'd Calabria's Hills so bright, O' th' other Sicily shone forth in light, Like sisters fair, by deep waves held in twain, Smiling upon each other in delight, And stretching out their arms in loving pain, As tho' they fondly wished to meet again.

Shortly after, I found myself again on Italian ground, and among scenes familiar to me from early youth. I arrived here in the middle of the Carnival ; which is the Bairam of the Italians, with this dif ference, that with them it precedes the fast or Lent, whilst among Mussulmans it follows the Ramadan. The Carnival is a time of mirth, pleasure, and folly; it is kept in most Catholic countries, but more par ticularly in Italy. It begins on the seventh of January and continues till Ash- Wednesday, but its public diversions are in many places restricted to the last ten days, in which masks are allowed to go about the streets from two in the afternoon till dark. During that time, the whole city, and par ticularly the principal streets of it, exhibit a scene of noise and confusion. The very children of the lowest classes assume an easy and cheap sort of disguise ; putting a shirt over their clothes, with a high pointed white cap, and a paper mask, which elegant costume is dignified with the name of Poli cinella, the dramatic title of the Neapolitan clown. Masks of all descriptions are sauntering about the streets, making strange noises ; stopping and ad dressing one another ; saying now and then some witty jokes, but often uttering coarse and vulgar nonsense ; teasing and annoying the passengers,"], [34, "12 CARNIVAL \u2014 ANECDOTE. who have no power of checking them : for it is positively forbidden by government to molest or offer any violence to the masks. If these, however, should carry the joke too far, and take improper liberties, the police then arrests them and punishes them severely. I often thought of the impression which the appearance of this people during the Carnival would make upon the mind of a stranger totally unacquainted with this custom, and who were to land here in the midst of this mad revelry. This reminds me of an anecdote which I heard at Malta. A Turk, who had been for sometime prisoner in that island, during the dominion of the Knights of St. John, after having been exchanged and sent back to Constantinople, was examined before the Divan, as to the strength of La Valletta, and the most probable means of taking it. He said he thought it almost impossible to conquer it as long as the Christians were on their guard, but, added he, \" there is a time in the year when the Infidels are subject to a periodical fit of insanity, (meaning the last three days of the Carnival, which was the only time allowed by the Grand Master for that popular diversion) and should the Capudan Pacha contrive to be near at hand with his fleet and a body of troops, I have no doubt but he could easily take the place by surprise, as all order and discipline are at an end during that period. But"], [35, "13 CARNIVAL AMUSEMENTS. the business must be done quickly ; for on the fourth day a priest applies a pinch of ashes to each man's forehead, which has the wonderful power of restoring him instantly to his senses and rational faculties.\" Se non e vero, e ben trovato, as the Italians say. The name of Carne-vcde is originally Latin \u2014 farewell to flesh \u2014 meaning, probably, that these are the last days for eating meat, as the following Lent forbids either totally or in part, the use of that kind of food. Some pretend that the Carnival is a rem nant of the Roman Saturnalia, which were accom panied with similar scenes of dissipation and folly, only indulged to a much greater extent, and which the Christian rulers, who succeeded the Roman Emperors in Italy, thought it wise to retain under some restrictions for the satisfaction of the populace \u2014 addicted in every age to noisy and giddy diver sions. The Carnival has not been very brilliant at Naples this year, on account of the bad weather ; we had almost constant rains during the time, which prevented in a great measure the display of masks in the streets. The f est ini or masked balls at San Carlo, however, were much crowded; but few mas chere di carattere or interesting costumes were to be seen. This is to be partly attributed to the change in the national character produced by the events of late years. The Neapolitans have lost"], [36, "14 CARNIVAL MASKS. much of that harmless gaiety, and that openness of disposition, which were formerly some compen- sation for the want of more solid qualities. A gloomy diffidence and sullen dissimulation, the re- sults of civil dissensions and foreign invasions, of political inquisition and bloody retaliation, have pervaded the ranks of this naturally thoughtless and careless people. They are as fond of pleasure as ever, but they cautiously avoid every occasion of committing themselves by disclosing their minds and shewing their sentiments in public or before strangers. I saw a great number of common masks, as black dominos, white policinellas, and richly dressed Turks. Some females, in the fanciful and rich costumes of the peasant girls of different provinces in the kingdom, appeared to great ad- vantage. I saw one day in the street of Toledo, Prince L , the king's youngest son, in a car, with a numerous retinue in the garb of ancient warriors, with shields and a kind of shovels, which they filled out of buckets full of confetti, discharg ing the contents against the company in the bal conies. This is a favourite pastime of the season, although sometimes attended with unfortunate con sequences ; for, as sugar confections are expensive, many persons substitute imitations of them made of clay, which are very hard, and some of them as large as common nuts, so that a shower of them"], [37, "15 THEATRE OF S. CARLO. proves a very unpleasant compliment, and serious disputes originate in this absurd custom. Soon after my landing, I paid a visit to the cele brated theatre of San Carlo, the finest in Europe. The interior of it is shining with gold. The blue ground is relieved by numerous gilt stucco orna ments. There are six rows of boxes, all private, arid closed like so many apartments, as is the case in every theatre in Italy. Ten five-branched chan deliers are fixed under each row, which being lighted up on gala days, produce a dazzling effect. A superb lampadaro or lustre suspended from the ceiling adds to this blaze of splendour ; which, how ever, in my opinion, weakens much the effect of the performance . and destroys the theatrical illusion. But these people are not very nice in this last particular. They do not come to the opera to take an interest in it, to have their feelings affected, or their senses deceived, but merely to hear the music. The house is seldom full. The seats in the pit are numbered and very commodious ; the price of ad mission is six carlini, about half a crown, except on illumination days, when the tickets are raised. No entrance money is paid to go to the boxes; so that many persons, particularly young men of fashion who have acquaintances among the nobility, frequent the theatre all the year round without paying any thing. The boxes are very spacious,"], [38, "16 GRAND OPERA. and occasionally suppers are given in them by the nobility. The king's box fronts the stage, and occupies two rows in height ; it is most richly, though not elegantly, adorned with crimson silks and gold, mirrors, fye ; the insignia of royalty are suspended above it. The whole is gorgeous and heavy. The curtain is finely painted with allego rical subjects alluding to the re-edification of the theatre after the fire of 1816, under the auspices of Ferdinand I. I observed a want of perspective in some of the scenic decorations, particularly in those which represent streets and buildings. The orchestra is very respectably filled, and the first coup d'archet of the overture is truly imposing. The opera most in vogue at the time, being re peatedly performed at San Carlo, was the Tan credi, by Rossini. La Malanotti performed the part of Tancredi, and La Festa that of Amenaide. They are both first rate singers; the former has a fine contralto voice, not agreeable, however, at first, but which, after the ear is accustomed to it, be comes very attractive, being full of pathos and ex pression. She sang beautifully the arietta di tanti palpili, which is her favourite. The first night she appeared on the stage of San Carlo she was but indifferently received, but has been applauded ever after. 1 observed, on this occasion, that the voice, unless very powerful, is lost in this immense theatre,"], [39, "17 BALLET OF HAMLET. perhaps less on account of its size, than of some fault in its construction. The persons who have the mis fortune to be seated in the farther half of the pit, can, with difficulty, distinguish a few words out of the whole opera. We had also a ballet, the title of which was Hamlet ; but the subject has been sadly disfigured. The ghost appeared to Hamlet in his palace, and, in order to explain the circumstances of the murder, pointed to a sort of mirror on which the horrible transaction was reflected; this con trivance had certainly a very striking effect. Hamlet became raving, and attempted at once to kill his uncle; the king was prevented by his wife from putting him to death, but had him confined in a dungeon, where he and all his court paid Hamlet a visit, and where a repetition of the same violence between uncle and nephew took place. The last scene was full of noise and confusion; peals of thunder were heard, clouds of smoke arose, the king was frightened, and Hamlet availed himself of this opportunity to stab him. The queen swooned, and to crown the whole, the ghost appeared again, surrounded with phosphoric light, to testify his sa tisfaction, and to give, as it were, his blessing to the audience. This was the substance of the plot, in termixed with pas de deux and grotesque dances. The dresses were gaudy, according to the taste of the country. The music, however, was delightful, Vol. I. c"], [40, "18 OPERA SER1A and atoned in part for the silliness of the per formance. The ballet is the favourite part of Neapolitan theatricals. They have a chosen company of French dancers; amongst whom are Vestris, Duport, Henry, and Taglioni. The dance seems chiefly to engross the attention of the audience, and the opera is com paratively neglected. It must be confessed, that an Italian grand Opera Seria is generally dull and destitute of all illusion, and has no attraction but that of the music. The libretto, or play, is usu ally a compound of nonsensical words, chiefly about love and revenge, put together just to run with the music ; besides which, owing to the size of the house and the feebleness of the secondary singers, it is impossible to understand one third of it : so that, with the exception of a few ariettas or duos, which attract the general attention, the per formance is allowed to go on as well as it can ; while part of the audience are whispering, simpering, or dozing in their seats, and the rest sauntering about, paying visits to the ladies in the boxes, or resorting to the adjoining gambling-table, or to the coffee room, until the time for the ballet arrives. The drama Semiserio, or melo-comedy, and the Opera Buffa, are much better adapted to Italian taste and Italian music, and also to the powers of Italian per formers."], [41, "19 DRAMA OF COMMINGES. I went several times to the theatre de' Fiorentini, the third house in Naples : La Canonici, a sweet singer, and a handsome woman with an interesting countenance, and a voice full of expression, was the chief attraction to that house. She was performing the part of Adelaide, in the historical dramas of Adelaide and Comminges. The affecting tale of those unfortunate lovers has furnished three dramas, which are performed in succession : the music is by Fioravanti: they are called, 1st \u2014 Gli amori di Adelaide e Commingio; 2nd \u2014 Adelaide maritata, e Commingio Pittore; 3rd \u2014 La morte d' Adelaide. The story is, in a few words, as follows : \u2014 Adelaide is beloved by a young nobleman of the name of Comminges, with whom she was acquainted from her infancy ; but her father, either through pride or avarice, compels her, during the absence of Com- minges, to marry a haughty baron, who takes her, a sad but resigned victim, to his feudal mansion in the province. She fulfils all the duties of a wife; but cannot entirely stifle her sighs, nor subdue a feeling of melancholy, which is soon perceived and closely watched by her jealous husband. After a time, Comminges discovers her retreat, and assumes the disguise of a painter, under which he is intro duced to the unsuspecting lord, who engages him to work at his gallery : Comminges submits to the humiliation, in order to obtain a sight of his be- C 2"], [42, "TALE OF COMMINGES. 20 loved. The surprise and the fright of Adelaide in discovering him are the more distressing, as she is at the time in the presence, and under the watchful eye of her husband ; however, she recovers herself, and in a second interview entreats Comminges to respect her virtue \u2014 to forget the past, and to leave her to her duty and to death. But while the fond lover, despondent although resigned, is on his knees taking a last farewell of the object of his affections, the husband suddenly appears: Comminges rises and boldly proclaims his name \u2014 they fight, and the unfortunate Adelaide, while endeavouring to sepa rate them, is stabbed by her furious husband; upon which, Comminges, growing desperate, kills his antagonist. He is carried off from that scene of horror by a faithful attendant, who conceals him in the neighbouring forest, and who afterwards returns to the castle to learn the fate of Ade laide. He is apprized of her death having been the consequence of the wound she had received; and that orders had been issued to search for, and apprehend Comminges. With these melancholy tidings he returns to the forest. The despair of Comminges is easily imagined ; meantime a terrible Btorm arises, and while they are looking about for Bhelter, the tolling of a bell is heard at a short dis tance among the trees. Comminges follows in that direction, and finds himself at the gates of a"], [43, "21 TALE OF COMMINGES. solitary convent belonging to the rigid order of La Trappe. Under the impression of feelings but too natural to an ardent mind bereft at once of all hope and happiness on earth, he thinks he hears the voice of Providence calling him to repentance ; and de spair and religion drive him into that convent as a last refuge for afflicted humanity, and a necessary scene of preparation for that better world, where he will meet again his beloved Adelaide. He conceals his real name, and is admitted by the superior to the noviciate. While this is passing at La Trappe, Adelaide, contrary to expectation, recovers from her wound, and proceeds, under a fictitious name and dressed in man's attire, to make inquiries after her lover; but as these prove fruitless, she gives him up for lost and resolves upon taking the veil. While intent upon this plan, she enters by accident into the church of the convent where Comminges is se cluded ; the fathers are singing vespers ; she hears again his well-known voice, and she soon after recog nises his features, though disguised under the cowl. In the struggle of contending passions, her purity of mind prevails ; she thinks him bound by everlasting vows, and feels that she can never be united to him in this world ; but having found him again, she will no longer part from him : her resolution is formed at once; she presents herself to the superior of the convent as a young man, willing to enter the order."], [44, "22 TALE OF COMMINGES. Aster some difficulties occasioned by her youthful appearance and superior manners, she is admitted to a preparatory trial, and she assumes the dark un- couth attire of a Trappensis monk, which effec- tually conceals her lovely features. A silence, which can only be broken by the permission of the superior, is one of the rules of the order, and Ade- laide, although daily in company with her Com- minges, remains unknown to him. She follows constantly and silently his faultering steps; she assists him in the performance of his several duties, and even in the task of digging his own grave, which is imposed upon every brother by the laws of La Trappe. She never utters a word, but she cannot entirely suppress her sighs nor conceal her tears. Her whole behaviour surprises Comminges ; however, as he can not conjecture the truth, he at- tributes it to sorrows similar to his own. But the delicate frame of Adelaide cannot long resist the anguish of her mind, and the privations and fa- tigues of her situation: she visibly decays and totters towards the grave. The superior perceives the Aveakness of the youth, and exhorts him to leave, while yet there is time, a mode of life not suited to his weakly constitution; but the novice persists in his resolution. Meantime the expiration of Comminges' noviciate approaches, and he is de termined to take the vows and bid an eternal adieu"], [45, "DEATH OF ADELAIDE. 23 to the world. The day of the ceremony arrives? and owing to the illness which prevents Adelaide from attending the church, and to the silence which surrounds her, she learns from the superior, only when it is too late, that but a few hours before Comminges was yet free, but that now he is for ever divided from the world, and consequently from her. This last blow destroys her remaining strength, and she sinks exhausted under the pressure of grief. The dying novice (Adelaide) is at last, according to the custom of the order, carried on a bier to the chapel, where the immortal soul will take its departure from its earthly frame, soothed by the orisons of the assembled commu nity. The funeral bell is tolling, the friars, and Comminges among the rest, are singing the last prayers for the agonized brother ; at last the vene rable superior allows the youth to speak ; approach ing death frees him from his vow of silence; he is at liberty to utter his last sentiments, and to bid adieu to the companions of his earthly pilgrimage ; with a faint voice he calls Comminges, uncovers his pale forehead, and the recognised Adelaide expires in the arms of her distracted lover. Such is this interesting drama, founded on facts which are not uncommon in the records of Catholic countries. It is easy to imagine the effect that the last scene, especially, must have on the stage, at-"], [46, "24 NEAPOLITAN STAGE. tended by all the insignia and awful accessories of La Trappe. Sobbing and crying were heard, par ticularly from the female part of the audience. I had then an opportunity of remarking that these people are not deficient in feeling ; the crowd of young men and fashionable ladies who attended these performances, which have been repeated for more than a month, is a proof of it. It is gene rally supposed that the Neapolitans, hke other southern nations, have strong passions ; I think, however, the definition is not accurate. They feel acute sensations ; but the impression is fleeting, like that which the breeze traces on the surface of the water. Sincerely affected by the sufferings of Adelaide at the moment, they will an hour after feel as truly delighted with the splendour and bustle of the conversazione ov of the ball-room. Before I leave the subject, I must mention an in consistency of the Neapolitan stage. In all the three dramas of Adelaide, even in some of the most affecting parts of the last, a buffo appears in the character of Adelaide's brother-in-law, and by some coarse ill-timed jokes, sets the audience in a roar of laughter. Casacciello, an excellent buffo of the Neapolitan cast, performed this part ; but I would rather see his talents employed on a fitter subject. The Teatro Novo is a small neat house, where"], [47, "25 PROSE PERFORMANCES. the prose company, at it is called to distinguish it from the melodrama, generally perform. They have some good performers, particularly De Marini, a first-rate actor. It is not very common in Italy to hear a good play, although their language is so beautifully adapted for it : Goldoni has furnished them with a store of comedies, many of which are excellent, but seldom performed. Federici, De Rossi, and recently Nota, have supplied an addi tional stock. The dramas of Metastasio afford also a plentiful supply. The tragedies of Alfieri, Pinde monte, Monti, and others, are a treasure upon which they might draw, and thereby encourage others to follow the steps of those great writers. I look upon a good prose theatre as a great deside ratum in Italy ; it would help to form the character of the nation, to inspire them with noble sentiments, and to accustom them to the genuine taste and sweet sounds of the pure Italian language, so often grossly and barbarously smothered under provin cial jargon and pronunciation. Perhaps the too free sentiments of some of the dramatic writers are an obstacle to the production of their works on the stage. Still I have occasionally seen the Saullc of Alfieri performed at Rome, and his Filippo at Genoa, under the present governments of those countries; so that I know not whether the fault"], [48, "26 FRANCESCA DA RIMINI. lies with the rulers, or whether it is owing to the taste of the people. I saw a new tragedy, La Francesca da Rimini, performed at i Fiorentini, by the company Fabbrichesi. The author of it, Silvio Pellico, a young Piedmontese, of considerable genius, and author of several other poetical works, has treated that affecting subject with a masterly hand*. The performance went through with considerable ap plause. The actor who sustained the character of Paolo, showed a great knowledge of his art and of nature; the character of Francesca was but indif ferently supported. Indeed, I have remarked since my return to Italy a great deficiency in the female tragical performers, which has struck me the more after having seen Miss O'Neil, and the other ac tresses of the English stage. England seems to be the land of the tragic muse. The Italian tra gedians do not study nature sufficiently ; their expression is often forced, and their declamation rather monotonous. There are two other theatres in this capital, the Royal Theatre del Fondo, a very nne house, next to San Carlo in size, and at which occasionally the Opera Seria is performed ; and that of San Ferdi- * About this tragedy and its unfortunate author, see the treatise on Italian literature, at the end of this work."], [49, "POLICINELLA. 27 nando, which is not much frequented, being at the other end of the town, far from the fashionable world. Besides these five theatres there are two inferior ones, La Fenice and San Carlino, both in the Largo del Castello, and chiefly devoted to farces and pantomimes for the amusement of the lower classes : the performers speak the broad Nea politan dialect. There you see the PolicineLla in his genuine colours. This Neapolitan clown is one of the Italian maschere, such as the Dottore of Bologna, the Arlecchino of Bergamo, the Pantalone of Venice, fye, but is not an honourable specimen of the national character of his country, of which he is intended as a caricature. Policinella is a servant from Acerra, a village in the neighbourhood of Naples, and he is so highly gifted by nature and accomplished by education, as to be at the same time a thief, a coward, a liar, a braggart, and a debauchee ; still the facetious way in which he re lates his various feats enraptures his grovelling countrymen. He delights in licentious double en tendre, gross jokes, and dirty tricks ; there is not a single good quality in him; his cunning is very low, and he is generally outwitted when he meets with an antagonist, so that in the end he is disco vered, imprisoned, whipped, and sentenced to be hanged. Such is the celebrated Policinella. I saw at the Fenice a burlesque drama, in which"], [50, "28 INFERIOR THEATRES. two very handsome actresses from Rome performed in the real Italian taste, \u2014 graceful, natural, and bewitching. One of them acted the part of a pupil to an old painter, suffering under the usual vex ations and restrictions of persons in her situation ; she thwarted the views of her guardian by cun ning and by coaxing, being animated by the innate Italian wish of finding herself a lover at any cost : the other in a man's clothes, personifying a young clown from Foligno, and singing with all the me lody of her Roman accent ; the music delightful, and the tout ensemble rather loose in a moral point of view, but very fascinating. I ventured once into San Carlino. The heat and the smell of lamp oil were intolerable. Yet even there, on the lowest of Neapolitan boards, they had a pretty and tolerable good actress, worthy of a better stage. It is strange to find such lovely creatures in these paltry houses, and in a city not remarkable for beauty. The performance was Spettacolosa, as it is called there ; that is to say, pretending to be highly dramatic, full of noise, bustle, and strange incidents ; the subject was the conquest of Mexico. Montezuma, Cortes, and the high priest, were completely farcical ; Policinella was introduced of course ; the pretty actress acted the part of a daughter of Montezuma, and made some amends for the rest."], [51, "29 RE-EDIFICATION OF SAN CARLO. I have devoted a considerable space in this chapter to the Neapolitan stage, because the theatre in this country forms a most essential part of the social sys tem, and music is quite an object of national interest. Government takes a particular care of theatrical affairs; and the importation of a new prima donna, or a new dancer, becomes a matter of state. When, soon after the restoration of King Ferdinand, the theatre of San Carlo was consumed by fire, all classes of Neapolitans were in the deepest concern about it. It was a public calamity; hardly any thing else was talked of; some one was wanted who had the means of superintending the erection, and de fraying the expenses of the new building ; the trea sury was exhausted, being just after the late French occupation; private fortunes had also suffered con siderably : however, the manager, Barbaja, a Mi lanese, who had risen from menial offices to be a man of wealth and consequence at Naples, offered to advance part of the money, and to build San Carlo anew, and in a very short period; the go vernment were delighted ; they secured to him the monopoly of the gambling-houses, and the building went on with astonishing rapidity. At last the new San Carlo arose, like a ph\u0153nix from its ashes, and on the first evening the house opened, the crowd was excessive. Sicilian noblemen, and ladies of high rank, came even from Palermo on purpose"], [52, "30 TASTE FOR MUSIC. to assist at the first performance; but the trea cherous wind detained them in sight of the Mecca of their pilgrimage. The vessels could not enter the bay, but were obliged to put into the harbour of Ischia, where the anxious travellers spent in gloom and disappointment that night, in which their more fortunate rivals, the Neapolitan nobility, glittered in full splendour in the handsome boxes of the new theatre. Music is the chief business of the fashionables in this country, who being delighted to have a national subject upon which they can talk freely and propose the innovations they like, divide there upon into parties, with all the enthusiasm and ani mosity which in other countries are attached to political and religious tenets. There are several houses for the performance of pupi or fantoccini during the day. Persons may go in for a few grains, provided their olfactory nerves can resist the effluvia which emanate from the crowd of dirty fellows who resort to them. There are also ambulatory puppet-shows in the streets."], [53, "31 CHAPTER III. DESCRIPTION OF NAPLES. The general appearance of this country I found to be, as I knew already, the Eden of Europe. The Italian proverb calls it, un paradiso abitato da diavoli. The climate is delightful; the views are map-nificent.

What a display of classical scenery ! What memories of sad tales or of brilliant history, equally portentous ! Close by me is the lovely coast of Mergellina ; the verdant hill of Posilipo, with the tomb of Virgil rising on it; and, lower down, the church where Sannazaro is buried. I have been looking for an appropriate site for the castle of Paluzzi, described by Mrs. Radcliffe in her Italian, as having been in this neighbourhood, but I could not fix upon any particular spot ; it appears that no such a name even has ever existed. The church of La Madonna del Pianto, the fancied haunt of the appalling Schedoni, is to be seen near the Campo di Marte or reviewing ground, but its modern appearance does not agree with the account of the awful solemnity of its ca- pacious aisles so finely described by that powerful writer. The sketches Mrs. Radcliffe gives of the scenery of the country, however, are beautifully true to nature. Naples is an open, irregularly built city ; its greatest length is along the sea-shore, where it extends in an irregular curve about, four miles along the northern side of the bay. In the centre"], [55, "33 PAL.EPOLIS AND NEAPOLIS. of this range are the two castles, Dell' Uovo, and Castello Nuovo, the king's place, and the harbour, which is small and not sufficiently sheltered. The breadth of Naples is very unequal : at the west end it is much contracted between the hills of Vomero and Belvedere and the sea, so as only to admit of one or two streets in breadth ; it widens towards the centre, and there it extends to the north as far as the hills of Capodimonte and Capodichino, between which and the sea, the principal and most populous part of the town is built, including the old city, still partly surrounded with walls and ditcnes, and the extensive additions made to it in course of time, and now blended with it. Its greatest breadth, from the sea to the foot of the hill of Capo di Monte, is better than two miles from south to north. The ground on which Naples stands is very uneven, a considerable part of the city being built on the slope of the hills of Sant' Elmo and Capo di Monte. The first city mentioned by historians as having existed on this spot, was of Greek origin and called Pal\u00e6polis. Neapolitan antiquarians attribute its foundation, upon at least dubious authority, to Parthenope the daughter of Eumelus King of Chalcis in Eub\u00e6a, from whom it was originally called Parthenope, which name it afterwards changed into that of Pal\u00e6polis, in opposition to a new Greek colony which was built in its immediate neighbour- Vol. I. P"], [56, "34 PAL\u00c6POLIS AND NEAPOLIS. hood and called Neapolis or New Town. Both cities shared a common fate ; they first opposed the ambition of Rome, were conquered, and at last be came the allies of that overgrown republic. By degrees, however, Neapolis encroached upon the old town, while it blended itself with it. At last the name of Pal\u00e6polis became extinct, and the appella tion of Neapolis has remained ever since, and is now applied to a city eight times as large as both Pal\u00e6polis and Neapolis united. The extent of Pal\u00e6polis, such as we see it still traced in some Neapolitan maps, appears to have been inconsiderable. It occupied the ground of that part of the present city which lies behind the Mercato, between that and the booksellers' street, and where are the public schools and the Monte di Pieta, which is to the present day the worst built, and the oldest looking district of Naples, \u2014 where the streets are most narrow and crooked, the houses tremendously high, ruinous and crowded, and where a stray traveller who happens to venture in that labyrinth, sees the genuine Neapolitans of the old school, such as we may suppose their forefathers were some centuries ago, or even as far back as the old Norman and Aragonese dynasties. The original site'of Neapolis was further north. It appears to have been nearly square, and it now forms a most considerable district of the present"], [57, "35 OLD PALACES. metropolis; the streets of it, although narrow, are generally straight: here we find some of the finest churches and the most extensive palaces of Naples. There are parts, however, which are wretchedly old, and appropriately called le Anticaglie. Here are also the Archbishop's palace, the cathedral, the fine churches of S. Paolo and Gerolimini, the ancient church of S. Apostoli, the great hospital of the Incurabili, the convent of Pietra Santa, the palace of Avellino, and many other magnificent piles. The old palaces of the Neapolitan nobility are in this quarter. They are immense, massive, and ponderous buildings, apparently built for eternity, and now mostly deserted by their lords : once the seats of feudal splendour, they are now inhabited in part by menials or by strangers who seem lost in the spacious apartments. Powerful Barons built these mansions, suited to the barbaric and gloomy gran deur of their minds; for, amidst all their vices, they were possessed of fierce, aspiring, and often gene rous spirits. Their successors have dwindled into an unimportant race, whose palaces are no longer adapted to tluir state, nor congenial to their ideas. The two cities being at last united, the interme diate ground was built upon, as well as the space which lay between the old town and the sea ; and other additions were made at different epochs. The principal ones which are recorded were effected D 2"], [58, "36 FORMER EXTENT OF NAPLES. under the Emperor Justinian in the sixth century ; under the Norman kings, and especially William the Bad in the twelfth; under Pope Innocent IV., and Charles I. of Anjou in the thirteenth; and under Joanna II. in the fifteenth. It was Charles I. who built the castle Nuovo and began the Mole, both of which were afterwards extended by Al phonsus I. of Aragon. Naples so amplified became an extensive and considerable city, although still very inferior to what it is now. It was enclosed by walls, flanked by towers, and defended by ditches, great part of which are still to be seen, especially along the northern and eastern sides of the town, where the ancient line of fortifications, as it existed under the Aragonese kings who succeeded the Anjou dynasty, is still preserved. Several of the old gates of that time are now standing, such as the Porta Nolana, Capuana, San Gennaro, and others. The Spanish viceroys who ruled Naples after the extinction of the Sicilian Aragonese dynasty, ex tended the city farther west; the old walls on that side were razed, and the ditches filled, to render the communication free. Pietro di Toledo built the fine street which has retained his name ; by de grees the whole ground at the foot of Sant' Elmo was filled with habitations, and became the fashion able part of the town. Stretching still further, the"], [59, "ADDITIONS TO IT. 37 new buildings reached the hill of Pizzofalcone, the ancient mount Echias (from which, perhaps, the name of Chiaja is derived) where in ancient times another Greek colony had existed called Megara, which afterwards had given place to one of Lucul lus' deliti\u00e6 or magnificent gardens. This mount which projects into the sea near the centre of Naples, and breaks the curve which that city de scribes along the sea-shore, into two sections, was formerly joined to the little island of Castel dell' Uovo. The latter had been fortified early by the Norman kings, and by the Suabian emperors ; William the Bad in the twelfth century had a palace there. Behind the hill of Pizzofalcone a communication was opened by means of the street of Chiaja, with the beautiful Marina or Quay, which is now become the most delightful part of the modern town. The street of Toledo, which runs across the city for three quarters of a mile, is the principal street in Naples, although not exactly in a straight line, nor sufficiently broad in proportion to its length. It begins from a fine semi-circular largo or square, called dello Spirito Santo, and ends at the Largo San Ferdinando before the king's palace. This fine street was built by a Spanish viceroy of the same name, who predicted that it would become the most frequented part of the city, as it has happened"], [60, "38 STREET OF TOLEDO. in effect. It is always crowded to excess with people, carriages, horses, donkeys, fye, and being like all other streets destitute of foot pavements, is rendered very uncomfortable, especially for pedes trians. The number of retailers selling provisions and goods of every description in the street ; the people working and cooking in front of the shops, which, for the benefit of the air, are mostly open ; the quantity of curricoli or gigs drawn by little spirited horses, and driving furiously along ; the swarms of vagrants and beggars infesting the place at all hours; \u2014 all these mixed with the gay and splendid equipages of the nobility ; the appearance of well dressed females at the balconies ; the ele- gance of the numerous coffee and ice shops, exhibit an ensemble of contrast, confusion, and bustle, to wliich I have seen nothing equal in any other part of Europe. The naturally clamorous habits of the Neapolitans are strengthened by the continual noise which obliges them to vociferate loudly, in order to be heard even by their immediate companions. With all this, Toledo affords a very curious ap- pearance to a stranger by the variety of motley groups with which it is thronged : priests in black ; friars in white and grey ; officers in gay military uniforms ; paglietti or lawyers in their professional costumes ; sober citizens dressed in suits of a variety of colours, blue, green, brown, yellow, and grey ;"], [61, "39 MODERN BUILDINGS. women, some in the old Neapolitan manto, a black silk gown and hood; others in the modern costume, which they have adopted from the French ; those of the lower class, either with handkerchiefs tied round their heads, or with the Sicilian peddeme, a piece of calico thrown loosely over the head and shoulders ; and half naked lazzaroni having no other garment but merely their shirts and trowsers. I can hardly think myself in a civilized country, but feel as though transported to some of the European settle ments on the coast of Africa. Toledo is adorned by many palaces, although most of them not of the best architectural taste; the principal ones are those of Maddaloni, Angri, Stigliano, Cavalcanti, Berio, and others. The new structure erected for the bank of the two Sicilies, and for the finance or treasury offices, is remarkably elegant. Very inferior inhabitations, however, scattered here and there, form a disagree able contrast to the splendour of the neighbouring piles. The finest part of the city of Naples, is, without question, along the quay from the Castel dell' Uovo to the western extremity towards Posilipo. The range of buildings which lines one side of the quay, is composed, with very few exceptions, of elegant modern structures, whose stuccoed exteriors, white or yellow, contrasted with the spacious iron balconies"], [62, "40 VILLA REALE. and green Venetian blinds, form a brilliant coup cF\u0153il, seen from the bay. In front of them, for the space of nearly a mile along the sea-shore, runs the Villa Reale, a beautiful walk, consisting of several avenues of trees, adorned with fountains, stone benches, and marble statues. But the principal beauty of that delightful spot consists in its unri valled situation, commanding a view of the whole bay. When the trees are in full blossom, it realizes all that imagination can conceive of this kind. This walk was considerably extended and improved by Joachim Murat. Towards the middle of it, there is a small projection running into the sea, se cured with an iron railing, and surrounded with scats, so as to make a pretty terrace; the idea of this improvement was suggested, I am told, by a German princess who lately visited Naples. In the middle of the central avenue, is placed the famous group of the Toro Farnese, or Farnesian Bull, formerly in the gallery belonging to the fa mily of that name at Rome, to whose inheritance the king of Naples succeeded. This group repre sents Amphion and Zethus binding their step mother Dirce to the horns of a wild bull. The Toro Farnese, and the statue of Hercules, which is now at the Museum of gli Studj, formed the chief value of that gallery. The first mentioned group was in jured in the carriage, and restored by modern"], [63, "41 CHURCHES. hands. The head of the bull is peculiarly fine. But as these subjects of the fine arts have been so well and so often described by abler pens than mine, I sha!' not presume to intrude with any further observations. Naples contains several hundred churches; few of them are remarkable for their external architec ture, but the interiors of many are splendid and rich, with marbles, gold, and pictures. The principal amongst them are, the cathedral of San Gennaro, a gothic structure, containing many valuable paint ings, by Perugino, Giordano, Domenichino, Spag noletto, Solimene, and Vasari ; the churches of the various religious orders, such as II Carmine, built in the thirteenth century by Queen Margaret, the mother of the unfortunate Corradino, who was afterwards beheaded in the square del Mercato, opposite this church, and buried with his re lative and fellow-sufferer, Frederic of Austria, in the little chapel of Santa Croce ; San Domenico Maggiore, remarkable for its ancient tombs; Santi Apostoli, the oldest church in Naples; Santa Maria la Nova; the church of San Paolo, raised on the remains of an ancient temple of Castor and Pollux, of which two fine columns remain in front of the present building, and part of whose ori ginal walls were incorporated in the modern ones. This church deserves particular attention, on ac-"], [64, "42 CHURCHES. count of its fine paintings. The one above the entrance represents the sacrifice of Jeroboam; in the sacristia, or vestry, there are two fine frescoes by Solimene, one representing the fall of Simon the magician, the other the conversion of St. Paul. There are in these a boldness of design, a wildness of expression, and a vividness of colouring, which are characteristic of the Neapolitan school. It would be too long to enumerate all the re markable churches of Naples, such as Lo Spirito Santo, San Lorenzo, Sant' Aniello, il Gesu Nuovo, i Gerolimini, the church of 1' Annunziata, with the annexed hospital for the foundlings established by Queen Joanna, and many others. Many of these churches are possessed of paintings by Luca Gior dano, Domenichino, Solimene, Santafede, Lan franco, Schidone, and Spagnoletto. The more an cient amongst them contain curious monuments, connected with the eventful history of this king dom; several of them are built upon the founda tions of Greek and Roman temples, and adorned with pillars chiseled by pagan sculptors. One of the finest churches and monasteries of Naples was that of San Martino, a vast and con spicuous building, situated on the hill, and close by the castle, of Sant' Elmo. It belonged formerly to the Carthusian monks, and was very rich in paint ings. It suffered during the late invasions of the"], [65, "43 SANTA CHIARA. country; the convent is now appropriated to the residence of the military invalids, who enjoy there a salubrious air and a quiet retreat. From a win dow, at one of the angles of the convent, there is a most magnificent view of the city and bay of Naples. In the splendid church of Santa Chiara, amidst its modern gaudiness and gilding, stand the old gothic tombs of kings and queens of the fourteenth century, the gloomy memorials of the once power ful house of Anjou. The founder of this church was King Robert, son of Charles II. of Anjou, and the third prince of that dynasty, one of the best kings that Naples ever had, \u2014 the friend of Petrarch; his mausoleum is behind the great altar. That of his son Charles the illustrious, Duke of Calabria, is to the left. Next to it, near the vestry, is another royal monument, on which lies the statue of a female, crowned, and with a blue mantle strewed with golden lilies ; the gothic inscription on the slab is half defaced, but it is understood to be the mausoleum of the first Joanna, the famous regina Giovanna, whose name is still so familiar to the people of this country. To the right of the altar is the tomb of Mary, wife of Charles Durazzo, her cousin, of another branch of the house of Anjou. Next to it is the tomb of Philip prince of Taranto and emperor of Constantinople."], [66, "44 HOUSE OF ANJOU. Then comes the tomb of Mary's two daughters, Agnes and Clemence. All these tombs are sur mounted by the effigies of their occupants. There they all sleep in peace, \u2014 the proud race of Anjou, with the insignia of their royal origin, their crowns, and azure mantles speckled with the golden lilies of France. The two last mentioned sisters, who ap pear to have died at an early age, are lying on the same couch over their common tomb, in sisterly friendship, even after death. Youthful, lovely, and placid, they look the happiest of their family ; probably they were the most innocent. In the same church, next to the chapel of the Virgin and infant Jesus, is the tomb of Raimondo Cabano, or Capanno, a slave from Barbary, who, being purchased by the seneschal of King Robert, succeeded him at last in his dignity, and became the confidant of Queen Joanna. His wife Filippa, a washerwoman of Catania, and her children, Ro bert, count of Evoli, and Sancia, countess of Mor cone, were accused of the murder of King Andreas ; and after the entrance of Charles Durazzo, they were tortured with red-hot pincers through the streets of Naples. Amongst these monuments, the one which ex cites most interest is that of Joanna, countess of Provence and queen of Naples. Her memory is of a dubious character. She was beautiful and spirited ;"], [67, "45 JOANNA I. was left an orphan and a queen at the age of eighteen, in a corrupt court, and in critical times ; opposed to the popes on one side, and to the old enemies of her family, the Aragonese, on the other: in a fatal hour she married her cousin, Andreas, son of Carobert, king of Hungary, a young prince of rude habits, weak-minded, and yet having the ambition of holding the reins of government, while Joanna would only allow him the rank of the queen's husband. A friar, the director of Andreas' conscience, fanned the flame of discord between them. The Hungarians, whom Andreas had brought with him to Naples, were disliked by the people. The day of the king's coronation was approach ing, and that day was to be the first of Andreas' power. How he intended to exercise that power he had given reason to foresee, by having a block and axe painted on his standard. Joanna seems to have dreaded her husband's accession to power, and to have determined on preventing it by any means. She had recalled to court her former lover and relative, Louis of Tarentum ; and probably be tween him, the minister Acciajoli, and the in triguing Capanno, the fate of Andreas was de cided. The unfortunate prince was strangled in his own palace, in the year 1345. The following year Joanna married Louis of Tarentum."], [68, "46 JOANNA I. King Louis of Hungary, Andreas' brother, vowed revenge against Joanna, and collected an army to march against Naples. Joanna pleaded her cause before Pope Clement VI., who declared her inno cent. Louis appealed against this sentence ; it was revised by the Consistory; and then Jane stated that her antipathy against her husband was the effect of sorcery, which rendered her unanswerable for what she did. The pope proposed to have the affair made up for a sum of money; but the king of Hungary sternly answered, that he had not come to sell his brother's blood, but to revenge it. To the queen's exculpatory letter, he replied in these solemn words: \" Joanna, the irregularity of your life; the authority you have retained after the death of your husband ; your having neglected to punish his assassins ; your precipitate second mar riage ; and, last of all, your present exculpations, all prove that you are guilty.\" The inexorable Louis continued his march upon Naples, carrying before him a black standard, on which the circumstances of the murder were painted. The terrified Joanna had fled to Pro vence, where, being pressed for money, she sold Avignon to the pope for the sum of eighty thou sand florins. The king of Hungary entered Naples in 1348, and revenged his brother's death upon several of the accomplices. He soon after, how-"], [69, "47 HER MISFORTUNES. ever, abandoned his conquest, perhaps on account of the plague which then ravaged Italy; perhaps also to attend to the affairs of his kingdom of Hungary. Joanna returned to Naples, and resumed her government. Her favourite husband died, and she married James, prince of Majorca, who also died soon after ; she afterwards married a younger son of the house of Brunswick. Joanna continued to reign over Naples, for many years, encouraging the arts and sciences, and doing every thing that could possibly make people forget her crime. Plav ing no issue, she married her niece to her cousin, the younger Charles Durazzo, of another branch of the house of Anjou, whom she looked upon as her adop tive son and heir. But Durazzo's ambition was unac- companied[by gratitude ; he was perhaps also excited by his relative the King of Hungary, who had not forgotten his intended revenge against Joanna. Meantime the great schism of the west broke out between Pope Urban VI., and the ante-pope Cle ment VIL, a Frenchman. The latter was obliged to leave Rome, and retire to Avignon. Joanna, unfortunately for her, had declared herself for him. The fierce Urban, in revenge, declared Joanna guilty of high treason and heresy, and deposed her, crowning Durazzo King of Naples, and assisting him with money to conquer that kingdom."], [70, "48 joanna's death. Joanna in her distress and danger, being desti- tute of troops, listened to the solicitations of Cle- ment VIL, and adopted in 1380 Louis Duke of Anjou, brother of Charles V., King of France. But the death of Charles happening the same year prevented the Duke of Anjou from hastening to the succour of Joanna. Meantime Durazzo, irritated by this new adoption, marched upon Naples in 1381. Otho of Brunswick, the Queen's husband, was de- feated and taken. Durazzo entered Naples ; the un- fortunate Joanna was obliged to surrender, and was sent to a fortress in a distant province. Durazzo consulted the King of Hungary about the treatment of the princess. That relentless prince answered that she ought to die the same death as her hus- band Andreas. He was but too faithfully obeyed. Durazzo gave the order, and some of hisHungarians proceeded to the Castle of Muro, in the province of Basilicata, where she was smothered between mattresses, in 1383, thirty-eight years after the murder of Andreas. Thus perished the unfortunate Joanna, a prin cess endowed with great beauty and high mental qualities, the friend of Boccaccio, the protectress of letters and arts. After the death of her first husband, at whose murder it appears that she connived, nothing more has been reproached to her. Her tardy punishment seemed a retribution of"], [71, "49 CHARLES DURAZZO. Providence. The relentless but disinterested justice of the King of Hungary dictated his decree, but nothing can excuse Durazzo for being his willing instrument. Joanna had adopted him, she had fostered him, she was his aunt, his benefactress ; and in gratitude for so much kindness, he revolted, and murdered her. But he also met with a just re tribution. He did not long enjoy his blood-stained crown. The kingdom of Hungary became vacant, and Durazzo, being supported by a party among the nobility, proceeded to Buda, notwithstanding the remonstrances of his wife, was crowned and afterwards treacherously murdered by the opposite faction, in 1386. Ladislaus, his son, succeeded him on the throne of Naples. Louis Duke of Anjou had set out in 1382, for Naples, but arrived too late to assist his benefac tress, and died in his unsuccessful expedition. He was the head of the second House of Anjou, whose pretensions to the crown of Naples were founded on Joanna's adoption, but no one of whose princes was ever firmly seated on that throne*. Louis II. reigned awhile over part of the kingdom, but was at last driven away by Ladislaus. * L'Abbe Mignot has written a history of Joanna I., with evident partiality. Voltaire has spoken also in her favour. Giannone, the learned and intelligent historian of Vol. I. E"], [72, "50 V1CARIA. Leaving Santa Chiara and the melancholy re- mains of times long gone by, we proceeded towards Porta Capuana, the gate through which passes the road to Puglia. We went by the Vicaria, an immense massive building, the Old Bailey and New- gate of Naples, once a fortress of the Norman Kings, and now both a prison and the seat of the tribunals, \u2014 a fearful approximation of crimes and punishments, both often the consequence of the same vicious laws. Its ponderous walls, the abode of hundreds of wretches, its doubly and trebly barred windows, excite ideas of all the misery, filth, and degradation, \u2014 of all the horrors and abomina- tions \u2014 that rankle within a Neapolitan prison, and which are inconceivable to any one unacquainted with the state of the law in this country. Through all political changes, the laws in Naples have remained still most imperfect, and most imper fectly administered. This is the canker that preys upon the vitals of this country, and as long as this canker is not removed, and it can only be done by a firm and really enlightened government, it is useless to talk of other improvements. As a suitable appendage to the walls of the Naples, has also in some measure endeavoured to exculpate her. Villani, however, and other old historians, speak of her guilt with an appearance of the fullest conviction. \u2014 See Vil lani, lib. xii."], [73, "51 PORTA CAPUANA. Vicaria, we saw the skulls of felons affixed to the walls in iron cages. But these horrible exhibitions have little effect upon the people at large. Leaving the Vicaria we passed through the Porta Capuana. The carving in stone on the outside of it is beautifully rich, but the approaches to the Gate are truly Neapolitan; \u2014 shambles, oil and cheese shops, frying-pans, a variety of smells of rancid oil and onions, dirty rags and filth, beggars, in sight an hospital, farther on the mandracchio of Ponte Scuro, or common stews! We went to Poggio Reale, about two miles from Porta Capuana, to see the ruins of the palace called della Regina Giovanna, in a low ground on the right of the road. These remains are still consi derable, and occupy a large extent of ground. They consist of turrets and curtains, surmounted by battlements and massive chimney tops ; gothic arched doors, and winding staircases. We as cended one of the latter, and sat ourselves at one of the windows, from whence there is a lovely view of Vesuvius, Castellamare, Capri, and the Bay. I thought of the unfortunate Joanna; \u2014 perhaps she sat once at this same window ; at all events she must often have enjoyed the same glorious prospect. And where is she ? the mistress of this beautiful land, the ruler of the destiny of millions, the beau tiful, the powerful, the high minded and proud? E 2"], [74, "52 POGGIO REALE. Where is that frail heart, where is that aspiring mind, that playful wit, those elegant and fascinating manners? Her frailties and her crimes, as well as her talents and attractions, are buried in the tomb : that heart which vibrated so strongly, and made other hearts vibrate, is returned long since to its native dust and scattered to the winds. Other queens have succeeded her in this country, on this same perilous throne ; other queens have been like her, frail, guilty and unfortunate ; like her they have been exiled ; like her they new sleep with the dead. In one part of the ruinous walls, remains of fresco paintings are still to be seen, \u2014 some figures of men in the dress of feudal times; the colours are still vivid. The portal of the chapel is also re- maining, and the boy who acted as cicerone showed us the spot where Queen Joanna had her traboc- chetto, or trap-door, through which they pretend that she despatched her lovers. This strange story made me suspect that the Giovanna in question must have been Joanna IL, a more decidedly guilty character than her predecessor. Consulting afterwards Giannone, and the voluminous descrip- tion of Naples by the Canonico Celano, I found that the place I had been visiting was built by King Alfonso of Aragon, subsequent to both Joannas, but that the Anjou sovereigns had a"], [75, "53 S. 010. A CARBONARA. palace in that immediate neighbourhood, on the rising ground to the left of the road. The hill above Poggio Reale is called Monte Lotrecco, from Lautrec, General of Francis I., who had his troops encamped here during the famous siege of Naples in 1528. We returned to Naples, and passing again be fore the dread Vicaria, we followed the wide street of Carbonara, which is said to have been formerly one of the ditches of the old city. At the end of it is the Church of St. Giovanni, built by Ladislaus the son of Charles Durazzo, and afterwards com pleted by Joanna II. , his sister. This is the other famous Giovanna, or Giovannella, who is often confounded with her predecessor. We were here amongst her relations and friends. We saw the mausoleum of King Ladislaus above the main altar. The countenances of female statues are of the Nea politan cast ; the features regular, but having an unpleasant bold expression, destitute of feminine softness, all except one, the farthest on the left ; she has a sweet countenance very different from the others. Behind the altar, and by the side of Ladislaus' tomb, there is a door in the wall which we had not noticed. The sacristano applied a key to it, asking us whether we would see Queen Joanna's chapel, built by her directions in honour of the"], [76, "54 TOMB of caracciolo. Great Seneschal Gianni Caracciolo, her favourite and able minister, who long ruled in her name ; and who was murdered by rival courtiers, it ap pears, with her connivance. His statue is there ; the monument is of marble. The walls of this cu rious chapel are painted with ancient frescoes, allu sive to the history of that epoch. They are much defaced by time and dampness, and it is difficult to trace out their import. In one place Caracciolo is seen approaching the staircase of the palace, proba bly just before he was murdered ; in another, there is a female of high rank, whom I believe to be Joanna herself, weeping over a bier ; further on she is seen kneeling on the steps of the throne of the pontiff, apparently to confess her sins; at last, you see her on her death bed. The same features are to be traced thoughout these figures ; and, notwith standing the inroads of time, you recognise the same fascinating countenance, a creature of pas sion and instinct. This solitary chapel, divided and concealed from the body of the church, which itself is gloomy and unfrequented, is a fit spot for silent musing ; I felt I could have passed many an hour in looking over those faded paintings, endeavouring through them to trace the hidden feelings of their prototypes, who acted so conspicuous a part in the great tragedy of the world . Joanna II. , of the House of Anjou, sister of"], [77, "55 JOANNA II. Ladislaus king of Naples, born in 1371, came to the throne in 1414, after the death of her brother. She gave her confidence to her secretary and fa vourite, Pandolfo, a man of obscure birth, and to Sforza, great constable of the kingdom. In con sequence, however, of the discontents excited by her conduct and that of her favourite, she was induced to marry James Bourbon Count de la Marche, who was acknowledged king. The favourite was put to death, Sforza was imprisoned, and the Queen confined. But at the same time James distributed the employments to his French followers, and thereby irritated the restless spirit of the Nea politans, who released their queen. James was confined in his turn, and the French were turned out; Pope Martin V., however, obtained the king's liberty. James, disgusted with his wife and with his subjects, retired to Besancon where he turned Franciscan monk. Another favourite engrossed now the favour of Joanna. The high constable Sforza, indignant at this, invited Louis III., of Anjou, of that branch which had been called to the throne by the adoption of Joanna I . At the insti gation of Caracciolo, who was opposed to Sforza, Joanna II. adopted the natural enemy of her house, Alfonso of Aragon and Sicily, who came to Naples, but soon after quarrelled with the queen, and im prisoned her favourite. Sforza took advantage of"], [78, "56 SECOND HOUSE OF ANJOU. their dissensions, attacked Alfonso, conquered him, and prevailed on the queen to adopt Louis III., of Anjou. Joanna continued to reign till 1435, when she died, and in her terminated the Neapoli tan dynasty of Anjou. After her death, Alfonso of Aragon and Sicily took Naples, and his suc cessors followed him on the same throne, until the extinction of that family ; after which, the crown of Naples devolved on the Spanish monarchs who ruled this distant kingdom by means of Vice-Roys. Rene of Anjou, brother of Louis III., inherited his claims, but could never obtain possession of the crown, although he retained the pompous title of king of Naples and Sicily. His pretensions de scended to the French kings, and were the cause of the wars of the French in Italy under Charles VIII., and Louis XII. But all the invasions of the French ended in their discomfiture ; they were always driven out of Italy in the end, which made the Italians haughtily call their country la tomba dei Francesi: the grave of the French. The dynasty of Anjou in Naples began in blood, and caused much misery. Charles I., brother of Louis IX. of France, a ferocious conqueror, was called to Naples by the Popes, against Manfred the natural son of Frederic IL, of Swabia*. Having * See Dante Purgatorio, Canto iii."], [79, "57 CHARLES I. OF ANJOU. conquered the kingdom, he rooted out every trace of national independence which had been respected by the Norman kings, and their successors the Swabian emperors. He destroyed the Town House, built castles and donjons, and erected churches and endowed convents. He barbarously put to death the unfortunate Corradino who had come to claim the hereditary crown of his father Conrad. Under him the Sicilians revolted and massacred all the French in the island. His son Charles the Lame, however, and his grandson Robert more particularly, were good princes. Next came Joanna I., and hers was a reio-n of troubles and bloodshed. After her came the cruel Durazzo, who was murdered in Hungary ; his son Ladislaus was an able Prince, ambitious, and often at war ; he died by poison as it was supposed. Joanna II. completed the series: she bore also the pompous title of queen of Rome. In the same church of San Giovanni a Carbo nara, is a chapel to the left of the great altar which contains the tombs of the noble house of Caracciolo, erected in the old aristocratic splendour, sullen and grand. The name of the owners of these vaults is ancient and illustrious, but it awakens sad reflec tions in a person acquainted with the history of this country. Many other ancient tombs are contained in this remarkable church. The walls of the Sacrislia"], [80, "58 LENT are painted by Vasari. Among other figures there is a beautiful head of the Virgin ; she looks pure and lovely : Ave Maria, oh! that face so fair! Those downcast eyes beneath the Almighty dove. \u2014 Byron. We left the ancient church of San Giovanni a Carbonara, which has witnessed so many changes of dynasties and so many vicissitudes, and returned to the modern part of the town, to the gay Toledo ; our heads still filled with the recollection of the two Regine Giovanne, their vicissitudes, their guilt, and their fate. The Carnival has been succeeded by the Lent ; the penance and fast prescribed at this time are now but loosely observed. The Pope, in consider ation of the dearth of salt fish and other provisions, and perhaps on account, also, of the diminution of fervour, gave this year an indulto or permission to eat meat as usual ; however, the zealots abstain from it and content themselves with only one meal in the twenty-four hours. This is the way Lent used to be kept in former times by all Catholics. But now, 0 tempora ! 0 mores ! the greater num ber eat meat even on Fridays and Saturdays, which is actually a breach of the commandments of the church of Rome. The lower classes are the strictest in the observance of their religious practices,"], [81, "59 PREACHERS. During the Lent preachers are appointed to the principal churches, to deliver a sermon every day on the most important subjects of religion and morality. The dogmas of the church ; the com mandments ; the sacraments ; the seven mortal sins ; death and judgment ; hell, purgatory, and paradise ; the most striking passages of the gospel ; the passion of our Saviour ; all these furnish subjects for the quaresimale, which is the name given to this series of sermons. Two or three distinguished preachers are sent on this occasion from Rome, Tuscany, or the north of Italy, and paid handsomely to deliver a series of sermons in some of the principal churches of Naples. The church of Santa Maria la Nova, belonging to the monks of St. Francis, has generally one of the best. On this occasion one may hear a good specimen of sacred eloquence delivered in pure Italian. Some of the sermons are really beautiful, although at times too flowery, and too much ornamented with figures of rhetoric. The manner of delivering them would also appear too pantomimic to a northern audience; but this is the taste of the country, and orators who wish to make an impression upon the minds of the people, must accommodate themselves somewhat to their dispo sitions. It is at Rome that I have heard the best sermons during Lent ; many of these are afterwards collected and printed."], [82, "60 PREACHERS. Italy, however, does not rival France in the cul- tivation of sacred eloquence \u2014 there is no Italian preacher that can be compared to Bourdaloue, Massillon, or Bossuet. The quaresimale of Father Segneri, a Jesuit, is one of the best specimens of the kind, although its style appears now rather old. Cardinal Casini, who lived in the first part of the last century, was one of the most distinguished preachers that Italy has produced. Among those of latter times, Monsignor Turchi*, bishop of Parma, who died in 1803, is the most celebrated ; his homilies, his funeral and other sermons, have been printed, and are well known throughout Italy. His learning, his fiery eloquence, his vivacity, united to considerable religious dignity, which at times, however, savoured of violence and intole- rance, approximate, in some respects, the character of this distinguished Italian prelate to that of the illustrious bishop of Meaux. As for the common sermons that one hears on Sundays in the churches of Naples, they do not give, in general, a great idea of the learning and oratorical powers of the Neapolitan clergy. The orators either bewilder themselves in attempting to explain some of the mysteries of our religion; (such * I shall speak of Turchi and of Italian pulpit eloquence in the treatise on Italian literature."], [83, "61 NEAPOLITAN SERMONS. as a preacher I heard in the church of Lo Spirito Santo, who, in order to render the idea of Trinity intelligible to his audience, employed comparisons drawn from the ancient mythology of Jupiter, Nep tune, and Pluto ;) or, if they preach upon morality, they often enter into details either indelicate or de generating into the burlesque. One of them preach ing before a numerous audience, chiefly composed of females, and descanting upon the evil conse quences of the passion of love, described, in very lively colours, the beginning and progress of it, the ogles, billets doux, assignations, fye, by way of warning his auditors against the danger of such practices. A stranger, and even an Italian from any other part of Italy, is scandalized at the gross ness of these Neapolitan sermons ; but I have heard some of the national clergy assert that it is the only way to render them palatable to the greater part of their audience. The itinerant preachers and mis sionaries who are to be seen preaching in the streets of Naples mounted on a bench or stool, and ad dressing themselves chiefly to the lazzaroni, often reach the extreme of vulgarity in their expressions, to which their rude hearers listen with the greatest attention; and I have seen the latter at the close of the exhortation, fall on their knees, beat their breasts, and shed penetential tears : the con sequence is, that many of them follow the priest"], [84, "62 HOLY WEEK. to his lodgings, confess their sins, return stolen articles, forgive their enemies, and, in short, make amends for their past misdeeds as far as lies in their power. We should not, therefore, in a foreign land, condemn rashly whatever is not consonant to our own ideas of propriety, but rather look to the effects of such things, and judge from these rather than from the methods employed. It is unne cessary to add that the sermons I here allude to are delivered in the Neapolitan dialect, and are consequently unintelligible to most foreigners. In the afternoons of the Thursday before Easter and Good-Friday, the city of Naples affords a striking sight : people of all ranks go about visiting the different churches, where the lower part of an altar is fitted up with more or less splendour to re present the sepulchre of our Saviour. By an order from the police, which is regularly issued at this time every year, carriages are excluded from the street of Toledo, so that the people may quietly walk along without fear of being trampled upon by some careless or unskilful driver. The dress, cus tomary on these two days, is black, both for men and women. Such an assemblage as Toledo exhibits then is not to be seen any where else. Young and old, ugly and handsome, rich and poor, elegant and shabby, beggars and lords, servants and masters, are all seen walking along promiscuously, with an"], [85, "63 SEPULCHRES. air of decorum and sedateness very different from their general character. The King, Prince Leo pold, and the Princess his consort, went on foot, accompanied by their suite, through this sort of pilgrimage. The band of the grenadier guards was playing a dead march, and the soldiers carried their firelocks reversed. No bells are allowed to ring, no clocks to strike, for forty-eight hours, from Thursday morning to Saturday. A wooden rattle is employed to mark the hours. All this is in commemoration of the death of our Saviour. Mixed with devotion, there is a certain dreg of worldly spirit in this ceremony, which reminds one of Gold smith's description of Italy : \u2014 Processions form'd for piety and love I observed on this occasion, a greater display of female beauty than I had ever seen in this metro polis, and I acquired a better opinion of the Nea politan fair sex. The fact is, that a great num ber of pretty women, particularly of the middling classes, very seldom are granted the indulgence of a walk through the city, except on some great occasions, among which that of the holy week is never neglected. On the other side, the nobility, who, at other times, seldom go out but in their carriages, deign, on this solemn occasion, to mix with the pedestrians."], [86, "64 CORPUS DOMINI. The Neapolitan women are generally short, and inclined to embonpoint ; their beauty is that of the rose in its full expansion; \u2014 no timid, half-opened bud, but a proud, full-spread blossom, warning the admirer of its approaching decay. Their com plexion is very sallow, with a strong tinge of yellow in many ; they have fine dark eyes, black hair, noses generally aquiline, prominent chins, and mouths rather wide. There are few regular beau ties to be seen, but those few are of the finest cast. On the day of the festival called the Corpus Domini, there was a grand procession. It was led by the band of the regiment of guards ; then came a sort of verger carrying a great standard; the officers of the different corps of the garrison fol lowed two deep, in their best uniforms, bareheaded, each holding a lighted torch, and accompanied by a dirty lazzarone who was carefully collecting the falling drops of wax on a kind of shovel made of brown paper, which these fellows afterwards sell to the candlemakers. Next to the officers came a company of Franciscan friars with lighted tapers in their hands; they were followed by the canons of the cathedral, and a band of church musicians with fiddles, bassoons, and other instruments, playing at intervals ; and last, a priest carrying the host, and pacing along under cover of a white canopy carried by four assistants.

Of all the ceremonies of the Catholic church, these processions are certainly the least edifying, except at Rome, where all religious ceremonies are per formed in a truly solemn and impressive manner. The windows and balconies along Toledo were or namented with old-fashioned tapestry, and crowded with gaudily dressed females. Vol. 1. F"], [88, "66 CHAPTER IV. ENVIRONS OF NAPLES. The neighbourhood of Naples, which presents so many objects worthy of the traveller's attention, may be divided into two tracts, or districts, equally interesting ; one east, and the other west, of the city. The first includes the country around Vesuvius, Portici, La Torre, Herculaneum, Pom- peii, and Castellamare, of which I shall speak hereafter. The western region comprises the shores of the gulf of Pozzuoli, Baj\u00e6, and Cuma. The road to the latter passes through the grotta di Pozzuoli, a gallery cut through Mount Posilipo, the high land and promontory dividing the gulf of Naples from that of Baj\u00e6. This grotta is more than half a mile in length, and in the middle of it the objects around are scarcely discernible; the openings at the two extremities appear like two distant, luminous speckles ; people are warned of the approach of carriages only by the rattling of the wheels, which is echoed along the sides of the rock. A foot pavement would be here of the greatest advantage, as it would place the pedes trians in safety ; as the road is now, I am surprised"], [89, "67 WESTERN DISTRICT NEAR NAPLES. we do not hear of many accidents. Curricoli, or two-wheeled carriages, of which there is a great number for hire at Naples, drive furiously in op posite directions, and in the midst of darkness, along this subterraneous passage, which is often thronged with persons on foot; and it requires the expertness of Neapolitan drivers, and the docility of Neapo litan horses, to prevent mischief. A pleasant cool ness prevails in the grotta, and it would be a delightful retreat in the middle of summer. I sometimes fancied that it might be made a pleasant place for lounging, by being well lighted up, and having seats cut in the sides of the rock ; people might, after walking through the neighbouring gardens, resort to this subterraneous arcade, to take shelter from the burning heat of Naples. On emerging from the grotta, you pass the village of Fuori grotta, and leaving to the right the road leading to the lake of Agnano, proceed through a beautiful avenue of trees straight towards the sea shore, to the place called Bagnoli, opposite the little island of Nisita. At this island vessels per form quarantine ; and there is a lazzaretto for ex purgating suspected goods. The health officers seem to be very strict here ; but from what I have heard of the manner in which the quarantine regulations are enforced along the extensive line of coast of this kingdom, I think it is almost a fortunate chance F 2"], [90, "68 LAZZARETTO. that this country has hitherto escaped the contagious diseases which always rage in some part or other of the Mediterranean. In 1816, however, they had the plague at Noja near Bari, on the coast of the Adriatic, but it seems that the disease was not of the most malignant kind ; a cordon of the Austrian troops, who then occupied the king dom of Naples, prevented it from spreading beyond the place where it first broke out. I have often shuddered in thinking of the havoc the plague would make in a city like Naples, where such swarms of people, poor, ignorant and filthy, are huddled together ; it would rage in the same man ner as in the Levant, and scarcely any human efforts could put a stop to its ravages. Flow could go vernment prevent these people from communicating with one another ? how separate the different fami lies ? how support that part of the population, per haps more than one hundred thousand, whose means of subsistence depend upon their daily labour ? And yet the least neglect of the quarantine regulations might suddenly bring this dreadful calamity upon the country, and change these enchanting shores, now the abodes of gaiety and pleasure, into a region of horror and death. From Bagnoli we proceeded along the shore to Pozzuoli, a town delightfully situated, rising above the sea. Here is a fine view of the gulf of Baj\u00e6, the"], [91, "69 POZZUOLI. scene of Roman magnificence, luxury, and profli gacy. Here we are on classic ground, surrounded by memorials of the rulers of the world; we see the remains of their villas, their temples, and their baths ; we see the harbour where their fleets lay at anchor; we walk, as it were, in their pleasure grounds, and are as much among Romans as we should be if we were at Rome itself. But, alas ! how the scene has changed ! These once delightful shores are now uncultivated and deserted ! These abodes of pleasure and of continual spring are now covered with wild, though luxuriant, vegetation ! Scarcely any cottage is to be seen ; and in the course of June, the malaria assumes its dominion over the country, and drives away, until the month of October, the few wealthy inhabitants of Poz zuoli. The magnificence of the decaying monu ments renders the present desolation more striking ; but on considering them attentively, what do we see ? An amphitheatre stained with human blood ; a temple dedicated to the terrestrial Venus, the appropriate goddess of these shores ; and a tomb which reminds us of an imperial parricide : while, opposite to them to the south, stands the rock of Capri, the lair of the infamous Tiberius. The unprincipled ambition, the want of feeling, and the ferocity of the early Romans, paved the way for the foul corruption and degeneracy of their"], [92, "70 ANCIENT ROMANS. successors under the empire. The crimes of that mighty race of oppressors, their inhuman triumphs, their gladiators, the barbarous treatment of their debtors and slaves, their oppressive rights of pa rents, the murderous scenes of their comiti\u00e6, their ingratitude towards their best citizens, their vestals buried alive, and a hundred similar horrors, with which so many pages of their history are polluted, call forth our indignation so often, that we become reconciled to their fall. The Greeks and the Athe nians in particular, with all their enormous vices, were less great, but yet more interesting than the Romans ; we feel some sympathy with the former, but the latter are beings who have nothing in common with us. We admire, but we cannot love them. They strove to elevate themselves above nature; but nature, which always vindicates her rights, plunged them at last into the lowest degra dation, and the most debasing slavery*. Yet while we condemn the ancient Romans for their * The overbearing and encroaching system of the Roman republic towards the other nations of the earth, and the hatred it must have inspired to all independent and generous barba rians, are well expressed by Alfieri in his fine tragedy of Sofonisba.

The most important remains of antiquity at Pozzuoli are the extensive amphiteatre, which is now in a great measure filled up with earth and rubbish, and the temple of Serapis. The latter, built in honour of the Egyptian Jupiter, after re maining several centuries buried under the waters of the sea, was covered by an eruption of the Sol fatara, which drove the waters away, and it was discovered again and excavated about a century ago. Of this specimen of ancient architecture, only three columns of fine cipollino marble remain standing, and upon them one can perceive the Io g'ur sin re. Frapposto mare il tuo Dal mio terren parti va : io mai non posi In vostra Italia il piede ; a mano armata Stai nell' Affrica tu.

The pavement is almost entire, and the whole plan of the temple may be distinctly traced. Its form was square with a portico before it ; the altar and the place for sacrifice were in the centre on a raised ground. There were forty-eight cells constructed for the priests and their families in the outer wall which enclosed the temple, and also baths appropriated to their use ; great attention seems to have been paid to their comfort. The altar and the steps are of Parian marble. It is singular to see a temple de dicated to an Egyptian deity in a city of Cam pania, and to think of the changes that this country has undergone. There is a tolerably good inn at Pozzuoli, at the farther end of the town towards Baj\u00e6, where we took some refreshment on a terrace raised just above the beach, and enjoyed at the same time the cool sea breeze, and a view of the whole coast. He who has not visited this country can form no idea of the charms of such a situation, on a fine day in the spring. An old Cicerone, of the name of Toby,"], [95, "73 SOLFATARA. came to offer his services, making a great parade of a few phrases of broken English, which he had picked up during sixty or seventy years intercourse with travellers of that nation. We went with him up the Solfatara. This extinguished volcano rises immediately behind Pozzuoli ; on its summit there is a plain about half a mile in circumference, sur rounded by a high bank, and apparently sunk to its present level by the falling in of the top of the mountain during some eruption. The soil consists of calcareous earth, and is broken into crevices, whence issues a very hot steam strongly impreg nated with sulphur, of which mineral, thick in crustations appear around. A manufacture has been established here on account of government, at the principal cleft whence the steam issues with great violence, producing a hollow noise like that of falling water. The ground seems by the noise of steps to be hollow underneath. Only one kind of bush grows in this region ; the yellowish green leaves of which form a contrast with the whiteness of the soil. We descended from the Solfatara, and proceeded along the coast towards Baj\u00e6 on foot, the road not being fit for carriages beyond Pozzuoli. We left on our right the lakes Lucino and Averno, and went to the baths called ' of Nero.' A dark slop ing passage cut through the rock leads to the hot wells ; the heat of the steam, however, is so great,"], [96, "74 BATHS OF NERO. that few persons can descend to the bottom, and most of the visitors return before they have reached half way down. The water in the well is suf ficiently hot to boil an egg hard in two minutes. A guard with torches should always attend on strangers, to prevent accidents. In the month of June, many people resort from Naples to make use of these natural steam-baths ; they half undress and descend as long as they find the heat to be supportable; then after a copious perspiration they return, and rest themselves in the upper part of the grotto ; where at that season, some sort of ac commodation is provided for them. This treatment is found to be beneficial in several disorders. At other times the baths are deserted, and there is merely a kind of keeper who shows them to fo reigners, and gets what he can for his trouble. We saw the temple of Venus and two other circular buildings also called temples; then ascended the hill and passed by the castle of Baja, wliich commands the roads where ships lie at anchor sheltered from the fury of the lebeccio or south west wind, which blows sometimes very hard in the bay of Naples, and is always accompanied by a heavy sea. Baja consists of a few scattered houses besides the castle, in which there is a garrison. The neighbouring country is completely sheltered from the northern winds by surrounding hills, so"], [97, "BAJA, OR BAI\u00c6, AND MISENUM. 75 as to be a most desirable residence during the win ter ; it was, on that account, the favourite retreat of the ancient masters of the world. Leaving Baja, we descended the other side of the hill, and came to the shores of the Mare Morto, a marsh communicating with the harbour of Miseno, a well sheltered basin, which opens into the gulf of Baja, and anciently one of the principal stations of the Roman fleet. The shores of Mare Morto are still called Campi Elisi, or Elysian fields, from the glowing descriptions of the Latin poets, which probably originated in the solitude and silence which reigns all over this region, and the mild temperature of the air, that seems to lull worldly cares and passions asleep. The Cape Miseno, abruptly projecting into the sea, terminates the land. We had a fine view of the neighbouring islands of Ischia and Procida. The latter is a complete garden : its inhabitants are chiefly sailors or fishermen ; and its women are reckoned the prettiest in the neighbourhood of Naples. Many of them resort to that city, where they employ themselves as servants. Ischia is a large island, containing several towns : a very high mountain, called Monte Epomeo, once a volcano, occu pies the centre; from its summit there is a very extensive view. The wines of Ischia are remark ably good ; its brandy forms an article of expor-"], [98, "76 GULF OF BAJA. tation, and is sent even to America ; the baths of Ischia are celebrated for their medicinal qualities, and are frequented in summer by people from Naples. The Ischiajole, or women of Ischia, have a peculiar costume, which, as well as that of the Procidane, or women of Procida, resembles that of the Greek females of the Archipelago. From the shores of Mare Morto, we re-ascended the hill to see the Piscina Mirabile, wrhich is said to have been formerly a reservoir of water for the use of the Roman fleet. The vaulted roof is sup ported by four rows of massive pillars, forty-eight in number, made of brick, and encrusted with the hard cement which was so much in use among the ancients. It is a singular building, and in pretty good preservation. We now returned to the shores of the gulf of Baja, at a place called Bacoli, the ancient Baulis, close by which is the building called the tomb of Agrippina, where some remains of ancient relievos are still to be seen. Here we hired a boat, and proceeded across the gulf to Pozzuoli. We saw on our left the conical hill called Monte Nuovo, which was raised in one night by an earthquake ; and we passed close to several pillars of masonry built in the sea, which are said, I believe without founda tion, to be the remains of a bridge which Caligula intended to build across the bay from Pozzuoli to"], [99, "LAGO D' AVERNO. 77 Baj\u00e6. That maddest of all the mad rulers of the world did indeed construct a bridge, but it was a temporary one of boats. This is certainly a strange country ; a land of volcanoes and earth quakes ; of sulphur and hot springs ; fertile, yet uncultivated and deserted ; encumbered with the ruins of former greatness, and with memorials of the crimes and follies of mankind ! Another interesting excursion in this neighbour hood is to Cuma, the ancient Cum\u00e6. From Pozzuoli there is a carriage-road to Cuma. It leads to the right of the Lake Averno, of which you have a glimpse through the trees that cover its high banks. We descended to the shores of the lake, a fine circular sheet of water, embosomed, as it were, among hills; its former horrors, which have been described by ancient poets, are softened now into a sort of melancholy solitude, not destitute of attractions. Silence prevails all around ; a ruined building, supposed to have been a temple, rises on its eastern bank ; and a white walled farm-house is seen through the vineyards on the opposite side. In few other places have I felt so much of that voluptuous lassitude and indolent contentment, the principal pleasure of which seems to consist in the sensation of living, without any thing in the ele ments disturbing one's repose or occasioning pain. The mind is led through a succession of images,"], [100, "78 MONTE DI CUMA. soft and indistinct, flitting along as through a camera obscura, and rendering existence literally a dream. We looked for the entrance to the grotta della Sibilla, a gallery cut through the mountains which confine the lake of Averno on the south, and divide it from the gulph of Baj\u00e6. We found, at length, the ingress concealed by brambles, stones, and rub bish, and ventured in without a guide; by groping in the dark, we arrived, at last, to the opposite issue on the shores of the Lucrine, which is now a mere stagnant pool. We then went back round the hills of the Averno, and rejoined our carriage on the road to Cuma. Passing under the Arco Felice, a singular arch be tween two mountains, we found ourselves on the shores of the open Tyrrhenian sea, the waves of wliich dashing against the coast announced their presence by their distant roar. We arrived on the strand at the foot of the Monte di Cuma, a rocky eminence on this coast. Ascending the craggy path we came to a farm-house, which they call the house of the Sybilla; the people here have curious, and of course, not very authentic traditions, about that celebrated prophetess ; they show her baths, now converted into wine-presses. We saw several young wild boars confined in ancient structures ; these animals had been taken in the"], [101, "79 ANCIENT CUM\u00c6, NOW CUMA. neighbouring forest, which abounds with them, and is a caccia riservata, or royal hunting ground. We saw another grotta della Sibilla, an excavation in the rock leading to several subterraneous galle ries, half filled with rubbish, which are said to extend as far as Baj\u00e6 and the shores of Averno. This grotto seems to have been the residence of the Sybil, where she delivered her oracles. On the summit of the hill are the remains of a temple, said to have been dedicated to Apollo ; and certainly its commanding situation, under a resplen dent sky, rendered it an appropriate spot for the worship of that God. The ground is strewed with prostrate columns, fine marble slabs with Greek inscriptions, half covered with aromatic herbs, wild flowers, and the fallen leaves of vine-trees, which seem to grow here luxuriantly. From the summit of this rock we enjoyed a pros pect totally different from all those with which the immediate neighbourhood of Naples abounds. It was chiefly a marine view extending to the westward over the unbounded horizon of the great Mediter ranean sea ; the waters of which were beautifully shining in all their gradual hues, beginning from the furthermost sea-green, then softening as they approached the shore, into purple, lilac, azure, dark-blue, and at last, terminating in the white surf beating against the shore, the \" fremito marino,\""], [102, "80 VIEW OF THE TYRRHENIAN SEA. or distant moan of which, sounded melancholy yet pleasing. To the north we saw the lake of Luc coli, a fine oblong sheet of water ; and beyond it another long lake called Patria, from the name of a tower, built on its shore on the site of ancient Liternum, once the retreat of Scipio Africanus, the greatest and the best of his illustrious race. Beyond it to the North-West, the view extends towards Minturni and Gaeta ; the whole of that low region is flat, unhealthy, and desolate, though naturally fertile. The Domitian road from Baj\u00e6 passed through it, and by joining the Appian way afforded a direct communication between the metropolis and the Roman villas on this coast. Towards the east the view is confined by the hill Sant' Angelo, with its picturesque monastery on the summit, and Monte Gauro. Through the Arco Felice you have a distant vista of the hills of Pozzuoli. Turning to the South the little lake Fusaro lay before us, with a handsome pavilion in the centre, one of the numerous pleasure-houses of the king. The Lake Fusaro is renowned also for its excellent oysters, the best at Naples. The plain around the Monte di Cuma is strewed with ancient monuments, baths, temples, and tombs. We took a last view of this interesting scenery as the sun sunk under the waters of the Mediterra nean, and we descended with regret from the Monte"], [103, "LAC0 D' AGNANO. 81 di Cuma. This place, on account of its remoteness from Naples, and solitary situation, is not much frequented by travellers ; yet the whole country around is peculiarly deserving of the attention of the scholar, the poet, the painter,\" and the anti quarian. Cuma, as it is well known, was one of the first Greek colonies established on the Western coast of Italy. It was a place of importance long before the Romans extended their conquests into Campania. After that event, however, Cuma declined, and at last sunk into nothingness. The city was built at the foot of the rock, now called Monte di Cuma, which was, perhaps, the site of its citadel. We made another excursion to the lake of Agnano, a sine basin, about a mile in diameter, embosomed within the hills rising immediately around. It is a very sequestered place, fit for meditation and melan choly. The greatest silence prevails here. The hills are covered with wild shrubs, and high above the rest rises the Monte Camaldoli; on its summit stands a convent of the order of that name, which is among the most rigid of the monastic institutions ; one of its principal rules enjoins a rigorous silence. The Cenobites who inhabit those \" deep solitudes and awful cells,\" were deprived by the French govern ment of their lands, which lay round the convent, and which are now possessed by one of the former Vol.. I. O"], [104, "82 CAMALDOLI. ministers of Murat, who assumes the title of Count of Camaldoli. The banks of the lake of Agnano are very unwholesome during the summer, and the poor monks, notwithstanding their elevated situa- tion, are not secure from the baneful effects of the atmosphere ; their convent is certainly not the abode of luxury. As I sat on the peaceful banks of Agnano, the calm waters of which were rippling against the shore, I thought of the Roman con- querors who once lived in this very country, re- clined in the lap of luxury, and surrounded by Asiatic splendour ; and then turning my eye to that lonely convent, that asylum from whence the great worldly interests are excluded, and where man seems to wait only for death, I compared the two extremes of human condition, and as I weighed them in my mind they appeared to poise one another in the balance. The malaria is a terrible phenomenon ; it is an invisible fiend that extends its curse over that vast and beautiful part of Italy, which lies along the shores of the Mediterranean, and like the plague, changes some of the finest regions of the world into deserts. Is the want of population the cause of the malaria, or the malaria the cause of the want of population ? However this may be, as the evil stands now, the thing most important to be ascer tained is, whether any effort of man can destroy"], [105, "83 MALARIA. its influence. Several partial attempts have been made to colonize and cultivate the maremme, but the malaria has not decreased, and sooner or later the settlers have become its victims. Its effects are various according to different constitutions and habits. Sometimes it is a violent fever which carries a man off in a few days ; but more commonly it is an intermittent which destroys all the energies of the body, and emaciates the wretched sufferer, making his breath labour and his body swell. Some linger in this way for years; the winter generally decreases the paroxysms of the fever, but they return with the returning heat, and at last, at the falling of the leaves, the helpless victims wither away and die. The appearance of these poor crea tures during the summer is very distressing. The common traveller sees a specimen of them at the post-houses in the pontine marshes between Velletri and Terracina, on the road from Rome to Naples. The natural unwholesomeness of the lake of Agnano is increased by the quantity of flax put in it to steep during summer. Close to it is the well known Grotta del Cane, a cleft in the rock, whence a vapour arises so noxious as to take away the senses, and even the life of any animal which is compelled to inhale it for a length of time. The poor dogs upon which the experiment is repeated for the satis faction of every new traveller that arrives, are per- G 2"], [106, "84 GROTTA DEL CANE. fectly disciplined to this state of transition between life and death, and come whining to every stranger, offering themselves as it were to the torture. But when they are put to the trial, the keeper is obliged to hold them down ; they recover their strength on being restored to the open air. I feel a dislike for this exhibition; the satisfaction of one's curio sity is not worth purchasing at the price of the violent however temporary sufferings of an inno cent creature. We left the peaceful solitude of Agnano with the last rays of the setting sun, and returned to the unmeaning bustle and deafening noise of Naples. Here I shall terminate the account of my excur sions to the westward of Naples. I have described thus cursorily those enchanted scenes which I visited repeatedly and minutely ; but the traveller will find that every one of the objects I have mentioned is deserving whole hours of attention, and that many days and weeks might be usefully and most agree ably spent on the shores of Pozzuoli, Bai\u00e6, and Cum\u00e6."], [107, "85 CHAPTER V. CHARACTER OF THE NEAPOLITANS. It must always be a matter of extreme difficulty to trace a correct outline of the moral features of the whole of a population, so as to distinguish it from other nations ; for so many exceptions are always to be found, that an individual ought to be extremely cautious in expressing his opinion. Foreigners visiting Naples are mostly introduced to persons of the upper classes, who are, at least apparently, much alike all over Europe ; or to people of the lowest ranks, who are necessarily mercenary, and who have evidently an interest to show only the fair side of their character, and have, besides, that general desire, natural to Italians, of pleasing and captivat- ing the minds of strangers : these two classes cannot therefore give a correct idea of the nation. Other tra vellers have run into an opposite extreme; they have not even given credit to the Neapolitans for those good qualities which they unquestionably ossess. For my part, acquainted as I am with the dialect and manners of this country, and having had fre quent opportunities of mixing familiarly with per-"], [108, "86 WANT OF NATIONAL SELF ESTEEM. sons of all classes and stations, I shall endeavour to sketch faithfully what I have collected from actual observation. I intend in this chapter to speak chiefly of the inhabitants of the capital and its neighbourhood. A peculiar feature which strikes me in the cha racter of the Neapolitans, is their seeming indif ference to the opinion which strangers may entertain of their countrymen. The first expressions I heard from natives on my entering the harbour, and which I have since heard frequently repeated, were violently abusive of their own nation, accusing their country men of want of honour, faith, and charity. A Nea politan will often express his disdain of his own countrymen in the presence of strangers, so as to puzzle these about the manner how to behave on such an unexpected occasion. A person of my acquaintance finding himself once in this awkward position, and not knowing what to say in compli ment to his over modest guests, attempted, at least, to extol their sobriety, but he was immediately con tradicted, by an assurance, that even this virtue, so generally ascribed to the Italians, no longer existed at Naples. My friend seeing his officious civility so bluntly rejected, now joined in abusing the whole nation, as he perceived it to be agreeable to the sen timents of his hearers. This disposition is not to be found, I believe, among any other people ; for"], [109, "87 ANECDOTES. in general we see that individuals of all countiies, from the lowest and most uncivilized hordes, up to the greatest nations, are eager to assert the superi ority of their countrymen. The only explanation of this phenomenon seems to be, that these people being really persuaded of the inferiority of their moral state, by the daily experience they have of it in their intercourse with their countrymen, and by comparing their behaviour with that of the nume rous strangers who visit their country, cannot help expressing what they feel on this subject, with all their natural vivacity. Shame, the last lingering attendant of virtue, seems to be lost in the general corruption, and patriotism to have fled from the soil. There is a strong prejudice in other parts of Italy against the Neapolitans ; many of the latter seem to be so convinced of this, as to appear unwilling, when abroad, to acknowledge themselves as such. A young gentleman, a native of this country, but of Tuscan extraction, while travelling in Lom bardy, was introduced into a company where the usual question was put to him, \" what countryman he was ?\" He answered that he was a Florentine, which rather surprised his hearers, as he did not pronounce Italian with the Tuscan accent ; upon which he added that by an accident (combinazione) he was born at Naples. Brutta combinazione, \" a most unlucky accident,\" was the immediate reply."], [110, "88 INDELICACY OF MANNERS. It happens, at the same time, that of all Italians the Neapolitans are most tenacious of their broad accent, .of which they very seldom divest them selves, even after a long residence abroad, so that they are generally recognised on speaking a few words. Decency and delicacy are not conspicuous in the manners of the inhabitants of this country. Every thing is done in public ; the conversation runs upon the most extraordinary topics, and with as little dis guise as possible. Boys are seen running about the streets especially near the sea, in a state of naked ness, or nearly so. The entrances and stairs of the houses and palaces are filled with every kind of nuisance The windows and balconies are generally left open, so that every thing is to be seen which is going on in a neighbour's house. Neapolitans of almost all classes, when they come home, during the summer, that is to say, six months in the year, take off their coats and neckcloths, and sit down to dinner with their shirt sleeves tucked up to their elbows. This takes place also at the restaurateurs or eating-houses. Ladies perform their toilet with the doors of their dressing rooms ajar, in sight of servants and visitors. All this, however, ad mits of some excuse, as the heat of the weather is in a great measure one of the principal causes of such indelicate customs."], [111, "NEAPOLITAN SERVANTS. 89 The greatest familiarity prevails between masters and servants. The former often joke and laugh with the latter, and talk confidentially of their affairs and intrigues before them ; some even play at cards with them : it is natural, therefore, to expect no reverence nor subordination from domestics who are the confidants of all their master's foibles or vices. This renders Neapolitan servants perhaps the very worst in the world. They are dirty, lazy, and careless ; insolent and unfaithful. They are in general notoriously dishonest, so as to steal the paltriest things that fall in their way. Most of them, especially when out of livery, would think it beneath them to carry a bundle, or any thing in their hands through the streets, and will actually refuse to do so, and employ a porter for the pur pose. Gambling, sleeping, and defaming their masters, are the pastimes in which they spend the greater part of the day, while loitering in idleness in the ante-rooms. By their means, all the secrets of their masters and mistresses are made known to the world. Still the difficulty of finding better servants, and the danger of changing for the worse, make their employers put up with them. If threat ened to be turned out, they answer with the great est impudence that their masters will not be the better by the change ; it is a general saying amongst them that thev can give the law to their masters."], [112, "90 INDOLENCE OF THE PEOPLE. Foreigners generally provide themselves with ser vants from the North of Italy, who have a better reputation for honesty ; most of the custom-house porters are also from that part of the country. A disposition to laziness prevails in the inhabi tants of Naples, and this is a source of vice and indigence: In otia nata Parthenope. Work is done in a bad and slovenly manner ; the principal object of workmen seems to be to cheat their mas ters, and labour as little as they can for their wages. A Neapolitan of the working class goes to dinner regularly at twelve o'clock, and scarce any prospect of gain will make him delay this most important business ; after dinner he generally lies down for a couple of hours ; most of the shops are shut from one to four o'clock during the greater part of the year. Thus these people slumber away their life, and are consequently enervated and effeminate. Even the exercise of speech seems often to be burthensome to them : when not compelled by their passions or some other strong motive, they prefer expressing themselves by gestures. A stranger in quiring his way, or any other question, can hardly bring them to articulate a monosyllable in answer. I have seen a barber sitting gravely in his shop and dozing while his workman attended to business, and a boy was fanning him and driving the flics from his face. This general inclination to indo-"], [113, "91 MARRIAGES AMONG THE POOR. lencc and to the dolce far niente accounts in a great measure for the misery of the lower classes ; which is greater here than I have seen in any other country, and is particularly striking on holy days, and at their numerous festivals and proces sions, where thousands of ill dressed people are to be seen, with scarce a person amongst them having on a sciamberga or decent coat. Another source of poverty is the thoughtlessness with which they contract marriages, without having any means of subsistence. The little money the parties can bring together is often barely sufficient to defray the expenses of the marriage ceremony and of the nuptial dinner, and to provide them with a straw pallet, after which they are left to meet the morrow as well as they can ; and it must be observed that they have not the resource of parish relief. The women are very prolific and give birth to swarms of little wretches, who run about the streets half starved, half naked, and dirty ; and of whom those that escape death marry in their turn as soon as they are of age, \u2014 and thus, a mendicant generation is continually perpetuated. Mothers carry their little ones in their arms from house to house, endeavouring to excite pity and to support them- selves by begging.

Plow might this propensity be checked in a country like this, or rather, how could its fatal consequences be prevented without incurring greater evils, is a question for political economists ; connected as it is with so many civil and moral considerations, it seems to baffle human wisdom to resolve it. It is perhaps one of the most striking instances in which one can hardly doubt the inevitability of moral evil. The peevishness arising from bad diet, want of comforts, and all the other sad effects of the thought lessness and imprudence of these hasty connexions, shews itself with all the violence of southern tem per, and the poor children are often sufferers by it. Capricious rebukes, imprecations and blows, are profusely dealt to them by their wretched parents. A stranger can hardly form an idea of the poverty which the interior of poor Neapolitan families exhibits. Several generations are huddled together on the naked floor in a garret, or on the ground floor ; old and young ; healthy and infirm ; males and females, to the utter destruction of health, mo rals, and all remains of rationality.

There is scarcely anything here to be compared to the middling classes of England. There are few intermediate steps between indigence and riches ; between want and luxury. It is really distressing to see such a number of wretched beings, and appalling to think how easily they might be led astray to commit any crimes, as has been the ease in times of political convulsions. The wonder is, how they keep quiet at all, and it must be said, that amongst all their vices, these people are not naturally malignant or sulky ; they are, on the contrary, rather good natured when not provoked by immediate want or oppression. Women, par ticularly, have a look of carelessness and joviality in the midst of all their miseries which is truly astonishing. They are fully susceptible of a better condition, and the greater pity it is that they should be left in such a state of degradation. But many causes conspire to keep them down to it, which perhaps originate in part with the climate and nature of their country, and with their own phy sical and moral qualities *.

The men of this country are a stout good looking race. As for the women, there is less beauty among them than in any other part of Italy. One sees but few pleasing countenances among the young women ; the expression of their features is in ge neral far from agreeable ; their looks are too bold and daring; their voices coarse and masculine; and their complexions very sallow. Corpulence seems to be here an appendage of beauty. One of the first observations upon a woman is about her being bella chiatta. This is also the Moorish idea of beauty, for which mothers in Barbary cram their daughters with kouskoussu, that they may attract and I think it will hardly be denied, that the state of the at mosphere, and the consequent appearance of all the objects around, will incline a man either to gaiety or gloominess, to coldness or amorousness, to coarseness or kindness, and render him either phlegmatic or active, indolent or mercurial, fickle or persevering. I appeal to those natives of the North, who have resided in Southern Countries, whether they have not experienced there feelings unusual to them before, as isa re volution had taken place in their sensitive faculties.

I am almost tempted to believe, that in this as well as in other instances, one might trace at Naples the influence of the vicinity of Africa. The scarcity of beauty, and especially of grace in most Neapolitan women, may be attributed to the joint effects of their gross diet, and want of comforts ; to the violence of their pas sions ; their sedentary life ; and to a deficiency of care and attention to their dress and carriage. All these failings are particularly striking to a foreigner coming from Florence, Rome, or Genoa, \u2014 those three nurseries of fine women. The Neapolitans, however, find no fault with their countrywomen ; on the contrary, these always find admirers, whe ther young or old, good looking or plain ; and in this respect, Naples might really be called the pa radise of women. It is but fair to observe, that the heat of the climate and the volcanic and sul phuric atmosphere of Naples, must have their share in spoiling the complexion of females; in giving them that sallow hue that they all have; and in relaxing their fibres, so that a woman may be con sidered old at the age of thirty, while at fourteen girls are already full-grown. But, neither the climate nor their mode of living can take away from them their dark shining eyes; their naturally expressive mouths, when not distorted by their broad length ened pronunciation ; and their delicate hands and"], [118, "96 WOMEN. feet, which almost rival those of the Spanish beauties.

Their national songs are full of"], [119, "97 GALLANTRY. pathos and tenderness ; their pastorals* breathe the fire of real affection exalted by a burning ima gination. Little of the kind is to be found at Naples. The gallantry of the Sicilians rather re sembles that of the ancient Athenians ; the gal lantry of the Neapolitans appears to be more hke that of the Asiatics. The Sicilian women are be witching dangerous creatures, susceptible of all the tenderness, the self-devotedness, and the madness of love : there is often a romantic generosity in them, which renders them capable of the greatest sacrifices for the object of their attachment. Ab sence is the only rock against which their constancy is in danger of being wrecked; as it is pithily but candidly expressed in the proverb : Lontano dagli occhi, lontano dal cuore. Marriages at Naples among the upper classes are, as every where else, decided by considerations of rank and fortune ; but the rest of the population run into the opposite extreme. Matches are im prudently made in consequence of capricious and sudden inclinations, the nuptial vows are soon for gotten, recrimination and disgust follow close, and thence to infidelity there is but a step.

Apathy and carelessness are prevailing features of the Neapolitan character. These people only live in the present ; they drive away the idea of fu turity as an unwelcome monitor, and whatever they do is marked with thoughtlessness and want of foresight. If a funeral passes by, although it be that of a friend, salute a noi, long life to us, they exclaim, shrugging up their shoulders with undisguised selfishness. I have seen them pass by the wretched objects of distress which abound in the streets of this capital, without paying the least attention to them ; the sight of misery and disease does not in the least damp their spirits, and they hurry unfeel ingly on from the starving beggar to go and squander their money at a party in the country or at the gambling table. If they are in want of cash they contract debts which they have not the means of ever acquitting, without reflecting that this course will lead them ultimately to prison or to an hos pital.

All their desires are concentrated in the enjoyment of the moment ; carpe diem seems to be the uni versal precept. The same disposition renders them fond of gambling ; that exercise, by rousing their dormant energies, possesses great charms for them ; and the deceiving hope of making their fortune in one night, attracts crowds to the fatal table, where they generally complete their ruin. It is a common practice among many people in this country to promise any thing to captivate the friendship of a person present, without giving themselves the trouble of considering whether they will be able to perform what they have engaged themselves to do ; consequently, little trust is to be put in their words. When Vesuvius thunders aloud, or an earthquake threatens them with destruction \u2014 when fiery streams vomited from the roaring mouth of the volcano roll on, carrying devastation over the plains below \u2014 when the air is darkened by clouds of smoke and showers of ashes, the Neapolitans fall on their knees, fast, do penance, and follow the processions barefooted ; but as soon as the roar has ceased, the flame has disappeared, and the atmosphere has recovered its wonted serenity, they return to their usual mode of life, they sink again to their former level, 112"], [122, "100 SHOPKEEPERS. and the tinkling sounds of the tamburrello call them again to the lascivious dance of the taran tella. A want of decorum and good breeding is observ able in their manners. They are noisy and disor derly in their parties, indiscreet in their questions and reflections, indelicate and vulgar in their lan guage, vain, boastful, and exaggerating. Their broad stare in the streets is peculiarly offensive to a stranger. The shopkeepers of Naples are the rudest and the least complaisant I have met in all my travels ; many of them will hardly give themselves the trouble of reaching a package for a customer, or of answering civilly his questions. Another of their habits is that of over-rating their goods, and asking you double and sometimes treble the real price. The natives are used to it and chaffer with them in consequence, but a stranger is often imposed upon ; indeed it is almost impossible ever to judge at Naples whether one has paid no more than the real worth of any thing. From what I have said, it will appear that I look upon Naples as one of the most corrupt cities in Europe. It is, however, a corruption different from that of other capitals, such as Paris or Lon don ; it is a mixture of the rudeness of a people half savage, for such is the state of the lower classes, with the vices of luxury and civilization"], [123, "101 FOREIGN MANNERS INTRODUCED. fostered among the upper ones. It is a sad remark that the Neapolitans seem to have copied from the various nations that have successively ruled over them, rather their bad than their good qualities; and this observation is particularly applicable to their intercourse with the French, their late mas ters. From these, many of the young gentry have imbibed an unjustifiable and indiscriminating con tempt for the religion of their country, a restless disposition, with an additional taint of selfishness and vanity, without having been able to acquire in exchange that elegance of manners, and that easy and pleasing address, which, although dimi nished since the revolution, are still qualities in great measure belonging to the French. Parisian civilization and philosophy ingrafted upon the old stock of Neapolitan licentiousness could not fail to produce corresponding fruits. Having been obliged, by a regard to truth, to trace some unfavourable features of the Neapo litan character, I proceed to the more pleasing task of stating what I have collected on its fair side. And first, as I have already said, there is a great quantum of joviality and gaiety of temper in these people, especially in the middling classes. When not under the immediate pressure of want, the Neapolitan is good-tempered, commu nicative, and social. Considering the state of ig-"], [124, "102 GOOD QUALITIES OF THE NEAPOLITANS. norance and misery of the lower classes, heinous crimes may be said to be rare in Naples. The murders you hear of now and then generally ori ginate in the passions of jealousy and revenge; and a man who does not make himself the object of these passions has nothing to fear. I have often passed late at night through some of the most solitary streets of this city without ever meeting with an accident. One may here, as well as in any other city, have his pocket picked ; but murder is seldom added to robbery. Avarice is not the prevailing vice of this country ; \u2014 the people are rather inclined to its opposite extreme, and most of them live be yond their income. They are very fond of parties, and of meeting their friends at the social board. In the provinces of the kingdom people are dis tinguished for their disinterested hospitality. The Neapolitans are possessed of natural good sense, penetration, and humour ; they are naturally in clined to frankness ; some of them, especially elderly men, have often an honest bluntness of speech; their shrewd and expressive eyes are often, however, the only vehicles of conveying their sentiments, and a mute conversation is carried on between two per sons, of which a bystander who is not initiated in the mysteries of this telegraphic communication, has not the least suspicion. Their pantomime is excellent ; they always accompany their words"], [125, "103 LAZZARONI. with gestures expressive of their ideas. Their re partees are generally ready and appropriate \u2014 even the lazzaroni shine in them. Under the last occu pation by the French, a general of that nation just arrived at Naples had his trunk carried to the notel by a porter : on the fellow's request of a cer tain remuneration, which the Frenchman consi dered too much, the latter said he was well aware that Naples was a den of thieves; the lazzarone shrugged up his shoulders, and with a half sly, half simple look, turned to one of his comrades who was standing by \" Non te F aggio ditto,\"\" said he, \" ehe non ce nestanno chiu a Parigi de mariuoli, so tutti benuti ca ?\" Did I not tell you that there are no longer any thieves at Paris, for they are all come here ? The Lazzaroni, of whom so much has been said, are a race peculiar to this country. The real Lazzari are porters, who live chiefly in the district called II Mercato, and who take their station in the day, in the different squares and crossways, to follow their occupation of porters. They are a tall, well-made, muscular race, with intelligent countenances. Their number has been much exaggerated; in former times they formed a sort of company and enjoyed some municipal rights, being under the direction of a chief or magistrate chosen among themselves, called Capo Lazzaro. Their number, however, as well"], [126, "104 LAZZARONI. as their importance, have much decreased of late. Their habits also have become more social ; they have now almost all a home to resort to at night, while, formerly, many of them slept in the streets, on the steps of churches, or under the stalls in the market-places. The name of Lazzaroni, how ever, is indiscriminately given to the lowest class, who have no regular trade, including fishermen and boatmen. Among such an assemblage there are of course many bad characters, but their evil pro pensities have been much exaggerated. \" The Lazzarone of Naples,\" says an intelligent modern writer*, \" follows freely his inclinations, like a wild boar in the depth of a forest.\" But his inclinations are generally harmless ; he is contented with little, and he works to procure himself that little, and enjoys his leisure during the remainder of the day stretched at his ease on the sea-shore, listening to Rinaldo on the mole, or gaping at Punch on the Largo del Castello. There is much less depravity among the real Lazzaroni than in the other classes ; those who are married look very strictly to the conduct of their wives, and serventismo is not in vogue amongst them. They are naturally shrewd, but jovial and good-natured, except in times of political troubles, when they have been worked upon * Mr. de Stendahl."], [127, "CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS. 105 by intriguing persons.

Naples abounds with charitable institutions. It contains many hospitals, among the rest the one called degli Incurabili, and the foundling hospital of I'Annunziata ; an immense workhouse called the Reclusorio or Serraglio, where more than a thou sand poor are provided with shelter and food ; an establishment for the blind at San Giuseppello at Chiaja, which well deserves the attention of the phi lanthropist, as well as the mad-house at Aversa, superintended by a person of the name of Linguiti, whose plan seems to be highly successful ; many colleges and seminaries for young men ; conservatorj or charitable houses for poor girls, among which, that of the Miracoli, instituted by Caroline, Murat's consort, is one of the best managed * ; the asylum * Caroline is the one among Napoleon's sisters who has left behind her by far the best character ; it is true, that being a queen, her sphere of action was more extended ; she did really much good, and might have done much more, had her husband been independent of his imperial brother-in-law."], [128, "106 SCIENCES AND LETTERS. for repentant women at L'Angelo Custode ; a Monte di Pieta, and many others which it would be too long to enumerate. All these are possessed of revenues given to them, either by government, or by charitable individuals. In the repeated invasions and changes to which this country has been exposed in our times, this sacred property has not always been respected ; the distresses which have fallen upon the wealthier classes have also limited the exertions of that charity by which the Neapolitans were distinguished. In point of science and literature, the Neapoli tans, although, generally speaking, they are behind the rest of the Italians, still can boast of many illus trious names among their countrymen. In the midst of the general torpor, there are in this country minds full of power and imagination, burning like the neighbouring Volcano, and who have the cou rage to break the spells of Armida. Sotto queslo Cielo non nascono sciocchi: observed one day a Neapolitan diplomatist. Most of their literary characters are unknown beyond the limits of their native country ; among those whose names are more familiar may be mentioned, Cardano ; Bruno ; and, in the last century, Vico, Genovesi, two great logicians ; Giannone, the author of the history of the two Sicilies ; Filangieri, who wrote on the science of legislation ; Cerlojie, the author of several comedies; the famous Galiani ; Cavalier Filomarino,"], [129, "LAWYERS. 107 and the Padre della Torre, both celebrated natura lists ; Mario Pagano ; Russo ; the two well-known physicians Cirillo and Cotugno ; and many others. The most learned class in Naples is that of the lawyers ; among whom are to be found many, who, besides a deep knowledge of their own profession, have also cultivated the muses to advantage, and who claim an acquaintance with the literature of other nations. The names of Gravina, Galanti, Saverio Mattei, and Nicola Valletta, belong to this class ; the latter wrote a very amusing work on the fascino, or evil eye. There is a Biografia degli uomini illustri del Regno, which contains a great many more names besides those I have mentioned, and which consists of several volumes. The law is the only profession at Naples in which a man of abilities may hope to advance, and to reach the highest stations. The Neapolitan lawyers excel in availing themselves of the intricacies and subtleties of their profession ; they have in a cer tain manner the best part of the property of the kingdom in their hands, as there is hardly perhaps a landholder but has two or three causes pend ing before the courts.

The Neapolitan barristers are elo quent ; they speak with an incredible facility and ease; there is a dignity in their elocution, and an insinuating courteousness in their address which are truly captivating. There are at present several literary characters in this country whose acquaintance is worth culti vating. Among the rest, the astronomer Padre Piazzi, who, although not a native, is a resident in this country ; a naturalist of the name of Lippi, who has written a dissertation upon the manner in which the city of Pompeii was buried; Cuoco, a man of distinguished literary merit, the au thor of / viaggi di Platone in Italia and of an elo quent account of the revolution of Naples in 1799 ; the prince of San Giorgio, an antiquary and poet; the Marquis Berio, an elegant poet, and well acquainted with English literature ; the duke of Ventignano, a tragic writer ; the Marquis Montrone, a distin guished literary character ; the Marquis Canetto ; and several others. The last-mentioned gentleman has written an imitation of Othello in blank verse, the language of which is eloquent and power ful. The song of Desdemona \" Fui felice un"], [131, "NOBILITY. 109 giorno ancIC io,\" is particularly beautiful, and written with all the softness and pathos of which the Italian language is susceptible. The Neapolitan nobility is divided into two classes, \u2014 the old families, among whom there are many names well known in history such as Pig natelli, Stigliano, San Severo, Caraffa, and many others, \u2014 and the new, upon whom the various go vernments which have succeeded each other within the last fifty years have bestowed titles. Many of the latter were raised to their rank by the old Queen Caroline of Austria ; others by Murat. The Neapolitan noblemen in general have an outward dignity of appearance, joined to ease of manners, sociability of temper, and a pleasing cour teousness of address. They are profuse and splen did, often beyond their means, which were much curtailed by the French. They receive well stran gers who are introduced to them ; and it is much to their honour that they support a social and brilliant establishment, 1' Academia de' Nobili, which is the first of the kind in Italy, and to which foreigners are admitted in the most liberal and hospitable manner. Several of the Neapolitan nobility are at the same time grandees of Spain, such as the dukes of Monteleone, del Vasto, and Berwick and Alva. Others are also Roman princes. In general, however, their fortunes are on the decline. The Sicilian"], [132, "110 MUSICAL COMPOSERS. families, such as Patern6,Butera,Trabia,cVc, are the richest in the kingdom. With regard to the feudal oppression exercised by the Neapolitan barons upon their vassals, such a grievance had been long out of existence even before the French invasion. The crown had abolished all feudal authority ; and those foreign writers, who, on a late occasion, have taxed the nobility with practices of this sort, were con founding all the while the old fierce feudal lords of the middle ages with their modern refined and democratized successors. Naples is well known as the country of music ; its conservatorii are nurseries from which many eminent professors of this science have been pro duced. The list of the Neapolitan composers is very long; the names of-Cimarosa and Paisiello shine above the rest like two stars of the first magnitude. Among the living ones, a young no bleman of the name of Caraffa has composed se veral operas, which have been received with con siderable applause, and he promises fair to sup port the character of the Neapolitan school of music. Naples has produced many eminent painters, among whom are the well known Salvator Rosa, Solimene, Santafede, Cavalier Arpino, and others mentioned already in the description of the churches."], [133, "111 MECHANICAL ARTS. Mechanical arts have made little progress at Na ples; although they boast of the china of their royal manufactory, of the cutlery of Campo Basso, the woollen cloths of Arpino, their guitars and strings, and their carriages, which are certainly the best speci mens of their workmanship. Still, generally speak ing, the arts are here in their infancy, and people who can afford to pay for the refinements of life are obliged to get them from France, England, and Germany. The articles of furniture made at Naples are clumsy, heavy, and unfinished; their doors, window-frames, and shutters, never close well, and admit the air through innumerable interstices, so that, on a rainy or chilly day, one is obliged to run out of the house to warm oneself. The best jew ellers, milliners, tailors, and shoemakers, are fo reigners ; the best restaurateurs are Milanese ; the only circulating library is kept by a Frenchman ; in the same manner the architect who has erected the colonnade in front of the king's palace, is a native of Lombardy ; a German has established a cotton manufactory at Piedemonte, a small town, about fifty miles from the capital ; and the prin cipal merchants and bankers at Naples are also strangers ; all which is certainly not to the credit of the natives. The best specimen of the state of the arts and"], [134, "112 YEARLY EXHIBITION. manufactures in this country, is the yearly exhi- bition of the produce of national industry, which is open to the public in the month of May, in the lower apartments of the National Palace de' Studj. This was first instituted under the French, in imita- tion of their own exhibition of theLouvre. This kind of display has been looked upon by some travellers more as a show to gratify national vanity, than as a useful encouragement to industry ; but in a country like Naples, which is so backward in all things of this kind, and where foreigners monopolize all the credit and profit of the mechanical arts, I think an exhibition of native workmanship must be pro- ductive of some good effects, by stimulating the self-love, and rousing the dormant energies of the people. I saw this year some good woollen cloth, from ten to twelve ducats the canna (which is a Neapolitan measure, about two yards English); sub- stantial but showy silks of the royal manufactory at Santo Leucio, near Caserta ; well tanned leather, good hats, coral trinkets, combs of tortoise or horn, which are esteemed in other parts of Italy; fine china ware, mathematical instruments, articles of furniture, fye This people seem, in general, rather better imitators than inventors. There was also an exhibition of paintings by living artists, among which were some good landscapes by Cali, and"], [135, "PEOPLE SUSCEPTIBLE OF IMPROVEMENT. 113 some historical pieces and portraits by Falciani ; I saw also some very good miniatures by M. Comte, a French artist. Zuccarello, an eminent miniature painter, a native of Calabria, died some time ago. Among the painters resident in Naples, must be mentioned Huber, a landscape painter, and a Swiss by birth, an artist of great genius; and Meyer, who excels in his views and costumes of this coun try, either in body colours or a l'acquarella. From all that I have said, it will appear that the Neapolitans are possessed of many good natural qualities, which either are slumbering in them, or are not directed towards proper and beneficial ob jects; yet the elements exist with which many things might be effected : and the mass of the nation, par ticularly in the provinces, is rather below civilization than advanced to the extreme of corruption ; their minds are like an unbroken soil, which contains all its primitive strength and fertility, and which, with the help of a skilful labourer, might bring forth an abundant and valuable harvest. If this country con tinue to enjoy peace, if the government apply itself at last to the encouragement of education and in dustry, and if the laws be found sufficient to protect property, Naples will certainly improve every year ; and the presence of many intelligent foreigners, who resort to this place from every quarter of Vol. I.

The Eastern, or rather South-Eastern, part of the neighbourhood of Naples includes Mount Vesuvius, the two buried cities Herculaneum and Pompeii, and the modern towns of Portici, Torre del Greco, and Torre dell' Annunziata. A fine carriage-road leads along this coast. Portici is remarkable for its royal palace, \u2014 a massive building, which, with that inconsistency which is a peculiar feature of almost every undertaking in this country, is built across the high-road to Castellamare, Salerno, and Calabria, so that all carriages and travellers of every description pass through the porticoes and courts of the regal mansion, on their way to the South. But from the terrace of this palace, facing the sea, there is a lovely prospect, one of the hun dred views in Naples and its neighbourhood, all beautiful and all varied in some features, although the great outlines remain the same. There are some fine gardens adjoining the palace. This was Murat's favourite residence, which he and his consort Caroline took pains to embellish with all 1 2"], [138, "116 PORTICI. the refinements of French luxury and voluptuous ness. King Ferdinand, when he returned, looked at these sumptuous apartments, but contented him self with a small apartment and a modest bed, where he slept as soundly as his predecessor ever did on his magnificent couch. Whether this was owing to his habits of simplicity, for which he has always been remarkable, or to a sense of pride, I cannot find fault with the old man's taste in this respect. The collection of antiques of every sort, bronzes, vases, and fresco paintings, taken from the ruins of Herculaneum and Pompeii, was at first tempo rarily deposited in a building adjoining the palace of Portici. These remains of the arts among the ancients are particularly interesting. Of the paint ings the design is bold, the colours still vivid, and the composition simple ; they do not give, however, any very great idea of ancient painting, but we ought to consider that they belonged to provincial towns and to private individuals, and we may suppose them to have been very inferior to the master pieces of the arts in Rome or Athens. The greater part of the collection has been transferred to the palace de' Studj at Naples, where it occupies several rooms of that magnificent museum. The suburb of Resina is but a continuation of Portici ; both are built above the ruins of"], [139, "117 HERCULANEUM. Herculaneum. You descend by torch light to see the theatre of the latter, which has been partly cleared, but little else is to be seen of that unfor tunate city. Herculaneum was buried in a manner different from that of Pompeii. Torrents of lava flowed over it in succession, one above the other, and its buildings became as it were cased in the hardened fluid. The excavations were begun under Charles III., but the great depth of the place, the difficulty of clearing the rubbish, the fear for the safety of the palace above, caused them to be abandoned. Pompeii has been more favoured, and is in great measure restored to air and light. I shall not say much about these subterraneous cities; the subject has been so often and so satis factorily treated by artists and men of science, that it would be idle, if not presumptuous, to add any thing to their elaborate descriptions. The philo sophical traveller, the lover of antiquity, the artist, and the man of feeling, find in these well-preserved memorials of times gone by, an inexhaustible mine of useful knowledge.

It is evident from the dilapidated state of the buildings, especially of the temples, that Pompeii had been partly destroyed by an earthquake, before its final disappearance from the surface of the earth in the year 79 of our era. This last catastrophe was produced by a shower of lapilli, or small vol canic stones, cinders and ashes, which choked up the streets and the houses ; after which, probably, masses detached from the mountain by alluvions or other causes fell upon it, and covered the rest. Vegetation grew on the new soil ; the waters levelled it and filled the interstices ; and, in the course of ages and among the invasions of barbarians and the wars of the dark ages, all traces of the ancient city were completely lost. Yet the summit of a few of the buildings remained uncovered ; but this is a sight so frequent in this country, that the peasants and the owners of the soil did not suspect that they were sowing their corn and raising their vines over the houses of an ancient city. Some accidental excavations led to the discovery. The houses of Pompeii are generally diminutive ; the apartments extremely small, but neat ; the mo saic floors beautiful; the paintings on the walls elegant though fantastic. The architecture resembles that of eastern towns; such is also the modern"], [141, "TORRE DELL' ANNUNZIATA. 119 architecture of Naples, only on a much larger scale. Even the principal streets are very narrow, and yet have foot-pavements on each side. However, the part of the town which has been as yet exca vated is comparatively small, and the Forum which was lately cleared, the adjoining temple of Venus, and the Basilica, give a higher idea of the importance of the place than had been formed at first. The private dwellings of the ancients were generally small ; the inhabitants, like the mo dern Neapolitans, spent the greater part of the time in the open air, in the streets, and in places of public resort. The modern lively bustling town of Torre dell' Annunziata is not two miles from the lonely re mains of Pompeii ; it is a considerable place of six or eight thousand inhabitants, having some trade, and known for its manufacture of maccaroni which is reckoned the best in the country. In one of my excursions to this place, I had occasion to visit one of the principal citizens who complained of the continual dread in which his townsmen were kept by the proximity of the great powder maga zine in which some thousand barrels of gunpowder were kept, and which, with the accustomed incon sistency I have already alluded to as peculiar to this country, was placed within this populous and thriv ing town, threatening every instant to blow it to"], [142, "120 TORRE DEL GRECO. atoms, at the mercy of the carelessness of the guards or of inevitable accidents. Remonstrances had been made, but to no effect ; and I am ignorant whether this nuisance has been yet removed. Torre del Greco, which is between Torre dell' Annunziata and Portici on the way back to Naples from Pompeii, has a gloomy dismal appearance. This town, as is well known, has been repeatedly the victim of the eruptions of Vesuvius, at the very foot of which it stands ; the lava has destroyed or covered many of its buildings, yet the inhabitants cling to their paternal inheritance, and build anew over the hardened stream. They have a saying : Napoli fa i peccati, e la Torre li paga, which means that they are doomed to do penance for the sins of the metropolis; a melancholy idea, one of the many of a similar cast, derived from a mixture of ancient and modern superstitions, to which the people of this country seem naturally inclined. Vesuvius has been of late in a state of great agitation. It is not yet exhausted as some people thought. An eruption took place a few days ago ; the explosion was announced in the middle of a stormy night by a tremendous crash, which, by its hollow and lengthened report, was easily distin guishable from the loud claps of thunder which were heard at intervals. The next mornino- we saw the torrent of smoking lava extending more"], [143, "121 VESUVIUS. than halfway down the mountain towards Torre dell' Annunziata, whence it took the direction of Pompeii*. On the following night the sight was truly beautiful. The red stream, running along the dark slope of the volcano, shone with a bril liancy, the effect of which was favoured by the clear ness of the air produced by a keen northern breeze ; and the distant groans issuing from the bowels of Ve suvius broke awfully through the stillness of night. Several parties, composed chiefly of foreigners, went up the mountain to examine the lava, the torrent of which, when once its direction is ascer tained, may be approached without risk to its very brink ; the only danger is that of a new eruption breaking out, or of a shower of stones being thrown up from the crater, of which last unpleasant oc currence I was once a witness in a former ex cursion to the summit of the volcano. The view from the hermitage, which is halfway up the mountain, is particularly striking by moon-light. The quietness of the place is only disturbed by the occasional rumbling of the mountain. The hermit and his assistant attend to the comforts of travellers, as far as the smallness of their premises * The last eruption, October 1822, was the most consi derable since the memorable one of 1794, and attended by the same terrific phenomena, darkness of the atmosphere, showers of ashes, &c."], [144, "122 EXCURSION TO CASTELLAMARE. can allow. There is one decent room with a com fortable sofa bed in it ; the hermit supplies good lacryma Christi, for which he demands a moderate price, but he makes no charge for the accommo dation or his trouble ; his reward is left to the generosity of the visitants. He keeps a register which is renewed yearly, as besides the names, many effusions of wit, or sentimentality, are inserted in it. On the 1st of August I set off with a party of friends to visit the peninsula opposite to Naples, and which divides this bay from the gulf of Salerno. We embarked in one of the lancie or long boats that set off every day about noon from Naples for Castellamare. This was the cheapest passage I ever had ; the fare is only a carlino, about four-pence English, for each person, besides which, one is expected to give a few grains per le anime del Purgatorio * : the distance is about thir teen miles, and we went across in three hours, chiefly by rowing, as there was scarcely any breeze. We had in company with us a party of strolling musicians who were going to a little town called * It is a general custom in Italy to collect money from charitable and religious persons, for the purpose of having masses and prayers said for the relief of those souls which are doing penance in purgatory, according to the catholic elief."], [145, "123 CASTELLAMARE. Gragnano, to attend a festival. They played some tunes when we were in the middle of the gulf, gliding through its blue waves, in sight of the most delightful scenery in the world. On arriving at Castellamare, we proceeded to the inn on the marina or walk along the sea-shore. We found this inn the best in the neighbourhood of Naples. The accom modations were good, the charges reasonable, and the prospect which the house commands beautiful. Castellamare is a place much resorted to in sum mer; its various mineral waters, which are bene ficial in many complaints, and its fine cool situation, sheltered by the mountains from the Scirocco, are the chief attractions of the place. The most cele brated waters at Castellamare are the acqua media, which is impregnated with sulphur, the acqua rossa, which is chalybeate, and the acqua acetosella, which resembles the acqua sulfurea of Santa Lucia at Naples. The common method prescribed by the physicians here is to drink half a bottle of the first in the morning, a tumbler of acqua rossa mixed with wine at noon, and as much of the acetosella as one can drink in the evening. This treatment, assisted by the salubrity of the climate, a whole some diet, and the romantic quietness of the place, is considered sufficient, when persevered in for a month or six weeks, to relieve a person from the liver complaint, if it be not too inveterate. The"], [146, "124 MONTE SANT1 ANGELO. expense of the waters is a mere trifle. A person may five at Castellamare cheaper than at Naples. On the morning of the 2nd of August we set out an hour before day-break, preceded by a guide, who carried some provisions, to ascend the Monte San Michele, called also Sans Angelo, which rises just behind Castellamare, and is the highest moun tain in the neighbourhood of Naples, being more than four thousand feet in height. It takes its name from a chapel built on its summit, in honour of the Archangel St. Michael. We began to ascend by a fine road, which winds along the hill be tween two rows of trees ; and we passed a country house belonging to the king, about a mile distant from Castellamare. The gardens are extensive, but they seem neglected, as the king seldom comes here ; grass grows in the courts, wild plants ob struct the walks, and every thing bears the marks of abandonment. We saw on our left Monte Coppola, so called because its shape somewhat re sembles a sailor's cap. Beyond the villa, the road becomes steeper and more difficult, until at last it is lost in the wood, and is succeeded by a path scarcely discernible. Owing to the presumptuous ignorance of our guide, who probably had never been up the mountain before, we lost our way, and lengthened our journey thereby about one half. The sun grew intensely hot, and as we emerged out"], [147, "MONTE SANT1 ANGELO. 125 of the woods, we found ourselves exposed to all its violence, which in the month of August, and in the latitude of Naples, is by no means inconsiderable. Two of our companions were disheartened by the disappointment of missing the road, and returned to Castellamare, while three of us pursued our journey. At last, at eleven o'clock, we arrived on the summit of the first ridge, whence we saw at once the gulf of Salerno on one side, and that of Naples on the other, with the open sea beyond Capri. We were then higher than the summit of Vesuvius, and we beheld at our feet the rich plains of Nola, and the towns of Sarno, Nocera, and Gragnano. We turned to our left through a chasm in the rocks, and descended into a valley that separates this first ridge from the upper sum mit, which is a naked cliff of calcareous stone al most perpendicular, and shaped like a fortress with two cavaliers, on one of which stands the chapel. Exhausted and thirsty as we were, we thought of resting ourselves before we attempted to proceed, and to our great satisfaction found a kind of recess or shelter under a rock, with a cool spring issuing from it. There we lay on the ground, and having recourse to our basket of provisions, we made a heartier meal than we ever did at the most epicurean tables in Naples. We were surrounded by a few sheep and goats, the only inhabitants of"], [148, "126 SPRING OF l'aCQUA SANTA. those wild regions. The spring is called V acqua santa, from an old tradition which reports, that the devil having once established a school on the summit of the mountain, was driven from it by the Archangel, and that while Satan was running down the hill as fast as he could, Michael threw his spear at him, which, missing its aim, fixed itself in the rock where it made the cleft from which the water springs. Without entering into the merits of this legend, one material objection to it struck me, arising from the circumstance of a projecting part of the rock situated so as to be in a line between the summit of the mountain where the Archangel is supposed to have stood, and the cleft in the rock said to have been formed by his spear, which could not well reach it without going round the corner : Credat Jud\u00e6us Apella. Some beautiful chesnut trees grow round this spot. A solemn stillness prevailed in the air, only interrupted now and then by the distant tinkling of the little bells fastened to the necks of the goats which were grazing in the valley below. A wretched object of distress, lying on the ground at a few paces from us, was a sad drawback on this peaceful and happy scene ; this was a poor man whom a swollen knee rendered incapable of moving from that uninhabited spot. He had come, he said, from Castellamare to carry provisions for some foreigners"], [149, "127 OBJECT OF DISTRESS. who went up the mountain, but the complaint in his knee growing worse by the fatigue of the journey, he was obliged to hall and lie down where we found him. There he had remained for two days and nights, without any food but what he acci dentally got from the charity of some straggling shepherd or traveller ; and there he seemed to be calmly waiting for the breaking of the abscess, which would require, he said, two or three days more. He seemed contented to pass this time in that de serted place, where he might however die of hunger and illness, or be devoured by the wolves. Such' scenes of wretchedness and helpless distress are fre quent in this country, and perhaps they are not so severely felt by a native as we are apt to think. There was no means of having him conveyed down the mountain ; but we gave him a share of our provisions, for which he expressed his gratitude with the warmth of a Neapolitan. After an hour's rest we left the Acqua Santa to climb the upper ridge. We ascended the naked rock by a flight of steps hewn in it, among stupendous masses detached from the mountain and hanging over the precipice, at the bottom of which the waves of the gulf of Salerno were seen lashing against the shore. At last, at about one o'clock, we arrived at the chapel, the goal of our excursion. There a most magnificent prospect rewarded us for all our past fatigues. An"], [150, "VIEW FROM MONTE SAN MICHELE. 128 extensive horizon presented itself to our view ; we saw to the east the whole gulf of Salerno, about thirty miles in breadth, stretching towards Cape Palinuro, beyond which the distant mountains of Calabria terminated the scene. To the west we saw the bay of Naples, with the islands of Ischia and Procida, and beyond it the greater part of Cam pania Felix, the plains of Capua, and the low grounds towards the Garigliano as far as Gaeta. To the north, the view extended to the great chain of Apennines which divides the Terra di Lavoro from Puglia and Abruzzo ; that majestic ridge, which may be called the spinal bone of Italy, running in a south easterly direction till it joins the Calabrian mountains, bounded the prospect. Many inferior ridges detach themselves from the parent chain and extend in a sloping direction towards the sea. To the south, the whole peninsula of Sorrento and Massa, which divides the two gulfs, lay spread like a map ; beyond it was the rugged island of Capri, and farther on, the Tyrrhenian sea completed the magnificent landscape. We saw Parthenope and its palaces reduced to a miniature, and the eminences which surround it appeared like ant-hills. The dark head of Vesuvius lay far below us, and it did not appear to be more than two thirds of the height of San Michele. The bay of Naples, encircled with a brilliant zone of towns, hamlets, and villas, con-"], [151, "129 VIEW FROM MONTE BAN MICHELE. trasted in a striking manner with the gulf of Salerno on our left. On the shores of the latter, nature is rude and wild ; here steep craggy rocks, there marshy desolate plains, in the middle of which stand the solitary remains of ancient P\u00e6stum : the plains are inhabited by herds of buffaloes, the only animal which thrives in those unwholesome regions. The gulf of Salerno has a much wider entrance than that of Naples; its scenery is majestic but gloomy ; there is much grandeur but little variety in it. The only spots that break through the broad surface of that immense expanse of water are two or three rocks called I Galli, the ancient Sirenum Scopuli, which were notorious places of resort for privateers during the last war. We saw, opposite to them, the little town of Positano, apparently almost under our feet ; it seemed as though we could have thrown stones on the terraces of its houses. The city of Salerno was concealed from our view by some hills. The stillness of the air and the clearness of the deep blue sky, in the midst of which the glorious sun was shining in its me ridian splendour, gave an indescribable grandeur to the scene. The busy world, and all its bustle, its pleasures, and its cares, appear insignificant, when contemplated from these heights. After having feasted our eyes with one of the most extensive views I ever saw, and which em- Voi.. I. K"], [152, "130 CHAPEL. braces perhaps the sixth part of the kingdom of Naples, we went into the chapel to shelter our selves from the heat of the sun ; the good friar who gave us admittance regaled us with a draught of water as cold as ice from the well. The chapel is very small ; there is a little dwelling house annexed to it for the use of the friar, who comes here every Sunday to say mass. What recommends this sanctuary to the popular devotion is the shrine of St. Michael, over which there is a statue of the Archangel, which is said to perspire regularly every year on the first of August ; the friar collects the drops of this holy dew by rubbing cotton on the stone, fills a vial with them, and parsimoniously dis tributes the liquor to the devotees. A large crowd of people collects on that day in the chapel, and naturalists have from this circumstance explained the phenomenon. An inscription attests the miracle ; but in spite of this puerility, the simplicity of the poor chapel of St. Michael, and the solitude of the airy region in which it is built, struck me with a certain awe, and I entered its precincts with more reverence than I had felt under the gilded roofs and in the marble aisles of the gorgeous churches of Naples. Such a spot as this puts one in mind of that elevation from which Satan displayed the pomps of the world to our Saviour. As we came out of the chapel, we saw the va-"], [153, "131 HISTORICAL RECOLLECTIONS. pours rising from the sea and the plains, and form- ing themselves into clouds; they ascended and spread very fast, and soon concealed the lower part of Vesuvius. At the same time the sky was beau- tifully clear above our heads, but rather hazy towards the edge of the horizon. I sat myself on the highest point of the rock to behold, once more, the magnificent landscape around me, and many classical recollections crowded to my mind. The scenes of the Eneid, the memorials of Roman his- tory, and those of the following ages, stood pre- sent before my eyes; on one side, Cape Palinuro, the grave of Eneas' pilot ; on the other, Gaeta, where Eneas' nurse was buried ; Torre di Patria, memorable on account of Scipio's exile and death ; Parthenope, Pozzuolo, Bai\u00e6 and Cum\u00e6, all places of resort and pleasure for the masters of the world ; Pompeii, Stabi\u00e6, Herculaneum, and Torre del Greco, famous in the annals of the terrible volcano; P\u00e6stum, celebrated for its wonderful monuments; Salerno and Amalfi, cities well known in the history of the middle ages ; \u2014 the former for its sovereigns, and their wars with the Saracens, and for the romantic exploits of a handful of Norman adven turers, who afterwards became the lords of this land: Salerno is also known for its early school of medicine. Amalfi, once a wealthy, commercial city, K 2"], [154, "132 RETURN TO CASTELLAMARE. claims the honour of the invention of the mariner's compass for one of its citizens, Giovanni Gioja. At last we thought of returning, and we started about three o'clock to that effect. I could not help regretting the necessity of descending from such scenes of sublimity to the haunts of men. The mind feels a pure satisfaction in being elevated, for a while, above the world, and in thus approaching the ethereal regions. I consider this feeling as one of those mementos which Providence gives us, to remind us of our better destiny. Opportunities of this kind occur but seldom in the course of life, but they remain impressed on the memory; they are so many bright landmarks through our earthly pilgrimage, hke the palm-trees which are scattered through the African waste. We were about three hours and an half in reach ing Castellamare, where we arrived about sunset, weary and hungry, but, it being Sunday, the mis tress of the house had gone to church ; an old ser vant that remained at home with a mulatto girl, could, or would, do nothing for us ; and to crown our misfortunes, Teresina, the landlady's niece, a stout, dark-eyed lass that attended us the day be fore, had eloped that very morning with her lover, the waiter of an adjoining coffee-house, so that we could obtain nothing to satisfy the cravings of ap-"], [155, "133 MOUNTAIN ROAD TO SORRENTO. petite. We patiently adjourned to our bed-room, which was also our parlour, and there waited until our padrona returned ; we had at last a comfortable supper, and after a good night's rest, I and a friend proceeded next morning to Sorrento by land, and the rest of our company returned to Naples. The road, or rather path, to Sorrento, leads over the mountains, - which form the peninsula between the gulf of Salerno and the bay of Naples. We passed the church of Pozzallo, about a mile from Castellamare, where a telegraph is placed, which communicates on one side with the one on the hill of Camaldoli, above Torre dell Annunziata, and on the other with Nocera. It forms part of the telegraphic line between Naples and Palermo, by which I am told, that in the former capital they can receive news from Sicily in eight hours. From Pozzallo, we began to ascend by a rugged, half traced path over the broken crags, until we reached half-way up the mountain, where the path turns in an horizontal direction, winding round the sides of the hill, and suspended, as it were, over a deep precipice, the foot of which is washed by the sea waves. The stillness of the air, only interrupted by the faint report of the distant surge, the soli tude of the place, and the wildness of the scenery around, contrasting with the distant view of the opposite coast of Naples lined with buildings glit-"], [156, "134 MOUNTAIN SCENERV. tering in the rays of the sun, \u2014 all these reminded me forcibly of Lord Byron's beautiful lines: \u2014 Where rose the mountains, there to him were friends, Where roll'd the ocean, thereon was his home j Where a blue sky, and glowing clime extends, He had the passion and the power to roam. The effect of mountain scenery in Italy, although less awful and striking than that of Switzerland, is, in my opinion, more romantic and pleasing ; owing to the charm of a lovely climate, to the brilliant colour of the southern sky and sea, and to the gay aspect of nature. The appearance of Vesuvius from this place is very grand. Its side towards Ottajano rises more boldly than that towards Naples; it stands op- posite like a frowning giant, dark, terrific, and alone. I would recommend this excursion from Castellamare to Sorrento, to all lovers of beautiful and sublime scenery, and especially to landscape painters, who will find here an abundance of sub jects for their art. We saw the clouds gathering on the other side of the gulf; and the loud roar of the thunder, repeated by the echoes of the moun- tains, added to the solemnity of the scene. After three hours' walk we arrived at Vico, a consider able, but straggling town, built on several hills ; it is the see of a bishop. From Vico we ascended again through a thick plantation of olive-trees, among which we lost sight of the sea ; but on ar-"], [157, "135 PIANO DI SORRENTO. riving at the highest part of the ridge, which forms on this side the boundary of the plain of Sorrento, we had another view of Vesuvius through an open- ing between the mountains, and at the end of a long vista of trees. Descending the hill, we arrived at Meta, a large village in the plain. This lovely region, \" II piano di Sorrento,\" em- bosomed between the mountains and the sea, and secluded, as it were, from all the rest of the world, is a complete garden planted with orange and lemon trees, through the foliage of which are seen glimmering the white tops of the houses, and the spires of the churches: this sequestered spot seems to realize the descriptions sung by poets of the valley of Tempe, or of the gardens of Armida. The plain is about five miles in length ; it contains eighteen thousand inhabitants, and is divided in three districts, called Terzieri, from the Spanish word Terceiro. Besides the city of Sorrento, placed at the farthest extremity of it, there are three large villages, Meta, Carotto, and Sant' Aniello. There is a striking difference of manners and morals between the inhabitants of this spot, and those of Naples, although the distance is so very short. Two hours' sail across the bay carries you from a busy, noisy, and corrupt city, into a kind of Eden, where tranquillity reigns, and simplicity and hospitality are still to be found; where no crimes"], [158, "136 CITY OF SORRENTO. are heard of; and where young men and girls ap pear gay, innocent, and happy. The men repair to the capital now and then only for the purpose of commercial intercourse, but their stay in town is short, and solely devoted to business. People talk, however, now, of making a carriage road from Castellamare to Sorrento, which would prove a misfortune to this district; the Neapolitans would then be enabled to drive to it in their curricoli, and bring with them their luxury and their vices, to contaminate these peaceful inhabitants ; and they would, besides, raise the price of necessaries, which is here extremely moderate. We proceeded to Sorrento, an ancient town sur rounded by walls and ditches, and famous as the birth-place of Tasso. The house in which that child of genius and feeling came into the world, is situated on a cliff that rises perpendicularly from the sea. Its present owner, a Neapolitan nobleman, has had it repaired, and the keeper admits strangers to visit it. The bust of Tasso remains as a memo rial of its former inmate. Many natives as well as strangers repair to the Piano di Sorrento in summer, it being a cool and pleasant retreat from the heats of the season. Apartments are to be had on moderate terms. In rambling over the country we saw the villa of Ma riano Stinca, an extraordinary man, who, from the"], [159, "137 VILLA STINCA. condition of slave, rose to be the favourite of the bey of Tunis, where he made a great fortune, with part of which he had the good luck to repair to his native country ; but afterwards, returning to Bar bary, he was murdered in one of the revolutions so common in that country. After spending two delightful days in the Piano di Sorrento, we reluctantly departed in one of the boats that sail every day for the capital."], [160, "138 CHAPTER VII. REMARKABLE OBJECTS IN NAPLES. Naples is the land of contrasts. There are strange sights in this place which are not to be met with anywhere else. We meet with spots in the skirts of this town where nothing reminds one of being near a great European capital. Houses of good appearance are contiguous to ruinous walls. On one side of the road you see fine gardens and an open country ; and on the other, a row of hovels crowded with swarms of the poorest people. Pro ceeding on, you ascend a steep flight of broken steps, through a chasm between rocks almost per pendicular \u2014 a most solitary place, which you might mistake for a recess in the Apennines \u2014 you ascend a hundred steps, and you emerge into a large and fine street well paved, and lined with convents and palaces, whence you see at once Vesuvius, the city, and the bay. These scenes are frequent in that part of the city which rises on the slope of the hills of Sans Elmo, and Capo di Monte, in the dis tricts called II Petraro, I Monti, La Salute, Lo Scudillo, I Cinesi, and Le Vergini. Another pe-"], [161, "139 CONTRASTS OF NAPLES. culiarity of this town is, that nothing is finished. You see a vast palace, the one, for instance, near the Mercatello, at the beginning of Toledo, the first floor of which is built with a princely magnifi- cence ; underneath there are many shops all oc- cupied \u2014 but the building has been for some years stopped \u2014 the second floor is only half raised, no lastrico, or roof, covers it ; the rain stagnates in the half-built apartments, and penetrates through the ceiling into the first floor ; the beams are al- ready rotten, and in a short time, the tenants of the shops below will be driven out of them : the build- ing is falling to ruin without ever having been com- pleted. There is an extensive square, II largo delle Pigfie, of which only a small part is paved, and the houses on one side of it present the ap- pearance of a city half ruined. The Largo dello Spirito Santo is decorated with a colonnade, in the centre of which it has been intended, these twenty years, to place a statue of Charles III. of Spain, the conqueror of Naples, and the head of the pre- sent Neapolitan dynasty. The unoccupied pedestal stands there surrounded by all kinds of filth and nuisances. In the fine street of Toledo you often see, in the same line, magnificent carriages, dung- carts, and asses laden with vegetables ; princes and beggars; friars and lazzaroni; finely dressed ladies and common trollops jostling one another in the"], [162, "140 CIMAROSA \u2014 MATRIMONIO SEGRETO. same crowd. At the entrance of a splendid palace stands a porter, covered with lace and embroidery ; and close by his elbow, under his master's windows, you see a paltry chandler's shop, with a cobbler's stall before it. There is also a peculiar strangeness in the diversions of the people : you are walking quietly through the streets \u2014 all of a sudden you hear piercing screams and dreadful yells ; you see seven or eight half-naked lazzaroni, with inflamed eyes and clenched fists, running after one of their comrades ; you think they are going to murder him ; no, it is merely a piece of frolic which shows itself in such a threatening form. But the effects of the anger of this people, when their evil passions are stimulated, have been seen in the revolutions of their country. I went the other evening to hear the Matrimonio Segreto of the immortal Cimarosa. The delightful music of this opera is just what I conceive music ought to be, not merely a scientific art, but a soft recreation, calculated to interest and amuse any man who has ears and feelings. The Matrimonio Segreto is truly an Italian composition ; it speaks the language, and portrays the humour of the people ; it is by turns gay and affecting, serious and burlesque; it expresses the different passions by which the characters appear actuated, so as to make one forget they are the work of fancy, and it mixes"], [163, "141 BALLET. with its charming sounds the theatrical illusion which music has otherwise a tendency to destroy. The Italian recitativo resembles so much common conversation, that we almost forget the actors sing instead of talk. David, Porta, and La Dardanelli, performed the principal parts : the first sang with exquisite feeling the celebrated air, \" Pria ehe spunti in ciel 1' Aurora.\" Porta excelled i'n the duo \" Se m' ascoltate un poco un poco.\" After the opera we had a ballet, \" Le retour de Mon sieur de Chahnneaux,\" which I had heard much praised, but which disappointed me. The buffo Tognino, a native of Bergamo, who accompanied the manager Barbaja in his journey to Paris and London, has composed this kind of pantomime in which he pretends to mimic English and French manners ; but his caricatures are strained and ex aggerated. He appears on the stage with his wife, as if just arrived from London, both dressed a VAn glaise, at least according to the ridiculous notions entertained here of English fashions. He affects to imitate English customs, but rather unsuccess fully, except that of shaking hands, which he re peats every moment, whether to the purpose or not. He changes his dress on the stage, and makes a dandy toilette, braces up his buckskins by means of a pulley, and goes through a great deal of dis gusting farce. Then he gets into a quarrel, and"], [164, "142 ROYAL PALACES. being challenged to fight, he refuses at first, and offers to box, and when presented with pistols he appears not to know how to handle them. At last all is settled amicably, and he walks down an Eng- lish country dance in a ridiculous and affected manner. This precious composition was intermixed with dances performed by the pupils of the royal school. A sense of respect for Prince Leopold, the King's son, who was present, prevented the audience from hissing the performance, which, however, they did heartily as soon as his Royal Highness left his box, and the hisses accompanied Monsieur de Chalu- meaux in his Apotheosis which terminated the farce. There was, however, a certain party, that seemed pleased with these vulgar and false allusions to the English, which agreed with their splenetic senti ments against that nation ; they attempted to ap plaud this miserable performance, but to no pur pose ; the greater part of the audience expressed their dislike of it. The Neapolitans, although ac customed to very low buffoonery, felt this to be too much even for their palates. The King of Naples has more and finer palaces, perhaps, than any other monarch of Europe. Be sides the Reggia, or Royal Palace of Naples, he has, in the neighbourhood of the capital, the palace of Capo di Monte, that of Portici, and the immense and splendid mansion of Caserta, which has few"], [165, "CASERTA AND CAPUA. 143 rivals in Europe. The great staircase of the latter is particularly magnificent. The palace of Caserta is situated in a plain near the foot of some incon siderable hills, about fourteen miles from Naples, and about five from the city of Capua. The gar dens annexed to it are very extensive, but rather in a bad taste, except the Bosco, which is a delightful place ; and in a bad taste also is the artificial cas cade, the water of which is brought over a superb aqueduct, which crosses a valley near Maddaloni, and which rivals in its kind the works of the ancient Romans. Three miles to the west of Caserta, is the place where stood ancient Capua, the capital of Campania, where the star of Hannibal first began to wane. The remains of the amphitheatre and of a triumphal arch which stands over the road, are the only things to be seen. The little town of Santa Maria di Capua, which is built close by, has not inherited any of the splendour of its proud predecessor ; it is a dirty ill-built place, and were the Carthaginian warriors to visit this spot now, its attractions would certainly not prove dangerous to them. Besides the palaces I have mentioned, belonging to the King of Naples, he has at his disposal a number of delightful country-houses and hunt ing-seats, as Carditello ; Persano, near ancient"], [166, "144 STYLE OF BUILDING. P\u00e6stum; the villa of -Castellamare;. the Castle of Procida, and others. The palaces belonging to the Neapolitan nobility are very numerous, and many of them spacious and lofty, but their architecture is in general de ficient in regularity and taste ; and the same re mark may be applied to most of the buildings in this city : they make but little impression upon persons accustomed to the more regular propor tions of the architecture of Rome. After feasting the eye on the churches and palaces of the latter city, a person becomes cloyed and difficult to be pleased, and is obliged to resort to the ancient mo numents to feel any satisfaction. The obelisks and fountains of Naples are particularly offensive to any man of the least taste, and form a wretched contrast with the fine works of this kind with which Rome abounds. One need only have a glance of the obelisk opposite the church of Gesu Nuovo, and that of San Domenico, to feel the truth of this remark. The palace of the Duke of Gravina, in the street of Monte Oliveto, and that of La Rocca, are good structures. The palace of Francavilla, near Chiaja, is a stately building, singular for its Moorish architecture, its insulated situation, and its fine gardens. The national palace degli Studj, contains au"], [167, "145 MUSEUM OF GLI STUDJ. invaluable collection of works of the fine arts. In the sculpture gallery are to be seen some of the finest productions of the Greek chisel ; the Farne sian Hercules, the beautiful Venus, the Flora, the Bacchus, the Orator, and several others, rank high above the rest. In the gallery of modern paintings the picture of Leo X. by Raphael, the Danae, the Bacchante, several Caraccis, Murillos, and Claude Lorraines, attract the attention. The Etruscan vases, the bronzes, the ancient utensils, and the papirj, form a mass of treasures unrivalled in any other country. The public library in the same palace, which is opened to the public at regular hours every day in the week, affords a great convenience to the stu dents of the capital. It is worthy of remark, that Italy, although generally looked upon by people beyond the Alps, as behind-hand in scientific and literary acquirements, affords the cheapest and easiest means of instruction of any country. Every considerable town has public libraries and public lectures, to which the studious are admitted gratis. I went lately to visit an Institution in Naples, which is the only one of its kind in Europe \u2014 the Chinese college, where young natives of China are broughtup to the ecclesiastical profession, and whence they return afterwards to their country, to propagate the Christian religion. The founder of this establish- Vol. I. L"], [168, "146 CHINESE COLLEGE. ment was D. Matteo Ripa, a Neapolitan mission ary, and a companion of the Beato Alfonso de Liguori, a name well known in the annals of the Catholic Church. Ripa went to China, and resided several years at the missionary-house at Pekin, where his skill in painting recommended him to the Emperor and Court. While living in that remote land, he conceived the plan which he after wards executed, of establishing a college in Europe for the education of young Chinese. Several trials were made, and at last Naples was fixed upon for this institution, as the climate appeared to be the most favourable and congenial to these children of the east. The youths destined for this place are smuggled out of their country at the age of thir teen or fourteen, by means of the missionaries, who send them first to Macao ; whence they are con veyed to Europe, generally in Portuguese vessels bound to Lisbon, from which place they proceed to Italy. The expenses are defrayed partly by this institution, and partly by the College de Pro paganda Fide, at Rome. The Chinese college is situated on the slope of the hill of Capo di Monte, in a quiet retired spot, which commands a fine prospect of the bay. The house and the adjoining church are simply but neatly constructed ; the apartments are comfortable and airy, and the whole place is kept remarkably"], [169, "147 CHINESE COLLEGE. clean, and in the best order, so as to form an agreeable contrast with the generality of Neapo litan establishments. The rector, a Neapolitan missionary, and a sensible well-informed man, po litely shewed us every thing deserving attention. We entered first the hall, which is hung round with the portraits of the Chinese who have resided in this house since its establishment; they are about forty, and among them is that of Ripa, the founder. It is the custom before any of the in mates of this college depart, to have their likenesses taken. They are dressed in the garments of the institution, a loose dark robe, with a red sash round the waist; and they hold the crucifix in their hands. There is a strong national likeness among them. Under every portrait is an inscription, which states the name of the individual, the pro vince he was born in, the year in which he came to Naples, that in which he departed again for China, and the epoch and mode of his death, when known. Those who have suffered martyrdom, are repre sented with the instruments of their death ; others have chains round their necks, as a sign of their having suffered imprisonment. Such a collection, in such a place, is apt to make, a solemn impression on the mind, and to raise a train of new and awful ideas. I thought of the singular destiny of these children of a distant region, of these young men L 2"], [170, "148 CHINESE COLLEGE. snatched from their native country, their homes, and their friends, and hurried away by religious zeal to a country, the people, manners, and lan- guage of which are unknown to them ; there to spend the best part of their youth in study and retirement ; and who afterwards, when in the noon of life, recross the ocean to revisit the scenes of their birth, as apostles of that faith whose propa- gation is the sole business of their lives, and on account of which they are hated, and often perse- cuted, by their own countrymen. They become victims of the intolerance of the laws, are scourged by order of a haughty and cruel Mandarin; and at last terminate their career of privation and pain, either in a dungeon or on the scaffold. There is something sublime and imposing in religious en- thusiasm, and in that disinterested spirit of abne- gation and self-devotedness, which sees nothing but the glory of the Creator, and the welfare of his creatures. An air of calm resignation, an in teresting sadness, are spread over all these portraits, and express at once the feelings by which their originals were actuated in this world. There were six Chinese in the college when I visited it; one of them was insane, and another blind. I had a long conversation in Italian with the latter, who appeared a very sensible man, and superior to the others ; his address was genteel and preposses-"], [171, "149 PADRE GIOVANNI. sing, his disposition appeared easy and obliging, his answers to my questions were appropriate, and he showed himself well informed of European affairs. I was told afterwards by one of the attendants, that he was the son of a Mandarin of rank at Pekin. He said that his voyage from Macao to Lisbon had lasted nine months ; that the vessel was a very long time in clearing the Straits of Malacca; that his sight suffered severely during the voyage, and that latterly he had the misfortune of losing it entirely. He cannot therefore return to China ; he will never see again his country, his home, or his kindred ; he will die in a foreign land, unknown, and un mourned; he cannot even aspire to the crown of martyrdom, nor can he pursue the accomplishment of his apostolic duties ; his career is closed on this side of the grave. Hard is his fate, indeed .' and this man, in his own country, might be perhaps now enjoying wealth, honour, and happiness. Still he did not seem dissatisfied ; he was cheerful, and resigned to his lot ; he spoke of his country with calm, but affectionate remembrance, and mentioned with respect the names of the great Kang-hi, and of Tsien Long ; he talked of the present emperor, and of his court. I asked him about the diversity of dialects in his own country ; he said that every province, and almost every district, has a particular one ; that the farther he travelled from Pekin, the"], [172, "150 PADRE GIOVANNI. more difficult it was for him to understand the com mon people ; that the language of the Mandarins is the same throughout the empire ; and he asserted that it is not very difficult. He appeared to have correct notions of geography ; among other ques tions, he asked me whether the differences between America and England were entirely made up. He said that Pekin, although under the same latitude as Naples, is much colder than the latter city, which he attributed to the plains that surround the former, and to its distance from the sea. I was much pleased with his conversation ; he spoke pure Italian with a very good accent. I felt towards him that sym pathy which approximates all persons of feeling, whatever be the spot of their birth. The hour for shutting the gates of the college was approaching ; I parted with regret from Padre Giovanni, the blind Chinese, and his remembrance will remain impressed on my mind as long as I five. We held our conversation on a terrace ; a fine view of the bay, and of the mountains opposite, lay before us : but all this magnificent scenery was lost on the poor Chinese, and was hardly heeded by me ; my fancy was soaring* at the time over the plains of Pekin. The College for a long time has received no new inmates, on account of the war: some youno- Chinese are now, however, expected from Macao, and, as"], [173, "151 CHINESE MISSIONARIES. soon as they arrive, four of those who are now here will take their departure for China ; one of them, a good looking man, came over to Europe with Sir George Staunton, of whom he speaks highly. I asked him whether they ever receive letters from their friends in China? he answered, \" very seldom.\" They were lately apprized of the death of two of their predecessors, who suffered martyrdom. What will be the fate of those four who are now preparing to go ? The good rector showed us a few curiosities from China, such as silk tunics and robes, some earthen ware of the imperial fabric, several tea services, some of bamboo, and some of tin ; other utensils, made of tortoiseshell, cocoa-nut, and ivory ; some wind instruments ; paintings of men, women, and masks ; Chinese prints, representing the empe ror's country-houses near Pekin, with the usual deficiency in the perspective ; and a large Chinese map of the Celestial Empire, which unfortunately was hung up too high to be attentively examined. The rector told us that the young Chinese who are brought to Europe, are generally born of Chris tian families, but that it requires great secrecy to get them out of the country : when they leave Naples, they proceed first to Rome, to be examined and approved of as missionaries ; after which, the college of Propaganda furnishes them with the"], [174, "152 REVIEW OF P1EDIGROTTA. means of returning home, by the way of Macao, where they assume again their native dress, to be enabled to penetrate into the empire. To my question about the natural abilities of the Chinese students, the rector answered, that in general they are possessed of moderate capacities ; but that there are now and then superior minds among them ; that they are in general patient, phlegmatic, and submissive, and excel chiefly in any thing mechani cal. They are taught Latin, rhetoric, philosophy, and theology. They talk Latin to their masters, and Chinese among themselves. Italian is pur posely avoided, to prevent their communicating with the Neapolitans, for fear that too great a familiarity should lessen the high opinion which they are taught to entertain of Europeans. The institution is possessed of a revenue of six thousand ducats, which has always been respected. Leaving the Chinese college with a feeling of sympathy for its inmates, I found myself again amidst the Lazzaroni of Naples. On the ninth of September, we had the grand annual review of the Neapolitan troops, called the Parade of Piedigrotta. The infantry was drawn up in a line three deep along the Marina of Chiaja, facing the houses, and turning its back to the sea. There were about twelve thousand men under arms, in general good-looking fellows, well dressed"], [175, "153 VILLEGGIATURA. and equipped: how far they might be depended upon, should circumstances require their services, is rather an awkward question to resolve. How ever, I am of opinion, that if properly commanded, and under good discipline, the Neapolitans, and especially the natives of Abruzzo and Calabria, would prove good soldiers. At five in the after noon, the commander- in-chief rode along the line; and shortly after the king drove slowly along in his state carriage, followed by his court. When his majesty had reached the right of the line, the troops began to retire, marching off by divisions from the left. This was the grand review so much talked of in Naples, for which some of the regiments came from distant parts of the kingdom. The king ap peared as stout and healthy as usual. The bal conies of all the houses on the Riviera di Chiaja were filled by the gay and die fashionable : there was on this occasion the usual display of music and martial pomp. The captain-general gave a dinner to six or seven hundred officers, at one of the restaurateurs: The months of September and October are the season for the villeggiatura, when families repair to their country-houses, where they remain until the month of November. The Neapolitans, how ever, have no idea of true country life ; what they call by this name is a misnomer. The country-"], [176, "154 COUNTRY HOUSES. houses to which the Neapolitans resort, are in the immediate neighbourhood of the capital ; some on the hills of Vomero, Arenella, and Capo di Monte ; and these are by far the best ; but the fashionable resort is Portici, where people are almost as much in town as if they lived in Toledo. The seats of the nobility are there situated chiefly on the high road, and exposed to all the inconveniences of dust, noise, and intrusion. Ladies dress in their gayest apparel, drive about in their carriages, receive visits, and give parties : to see and to be seen is the only object. There is nothing attractive in the residence of Portici, except its fine view of the bay ; you see splendid palaces, few gardens, and nothing of real country. What a difference from the delightful villas of the Tuscan gentry, with which the hills in the neighbourhood of Florence are covered. The grand opera now performed at St. Carlo, is La donna del Lago, the Lady of the Lake. There seems to be a prevailing Anglomania in the choice of dramatic subjects, which are now chiefly taken from the works of the great English poets, and are tortured into operas, ballets, and panto mimes. Hamlet, Macbeth, Othello, the Lady of the Lake, and Gulnare, are quite fashionable on the Neapolitan stage. I went to the Fondo to see my old acquaintance Casacciello, in that pretty opera buffa, L' Amor"], [177, "155 MODERN IMPROVEMENTS. Marinaro, and was as much pleased with him as ever : this kind of acting is indeed the best in this country. The city of Naples is of late years considerably altered in its appearance. One of the principal im provements is the new road to Capo di Monte, and the bridge forming part of it, which, like that of Carignano at Genoa, connects two hills, passing over the street of La Sanita. Beyond it the road is cut through the rock, and winds up to the palace of Capo di Monte. This extensive pile built on the naked summit of the hill, with its red walls, and grey pillars and ornaments, has rather a heavy appearance. The Strada Nuova by Posilipo, which winds round the promontory of that name, and in some places appears suspended above the sea, is the finest ride in the neighbourhood of Naples. As yet, it has been carried only as far as the summit of the hill, but will be continued on the other side to Bagnoli, so as to lead to Pozzuoli without pass ing by the Grotta. The entrance of Naples, com ing from Rome, has been also improved by pulling down a heap of wretched old buildings which stood near the gate of St. Gennaro; and the traveller now proceeds through a continuation of fine broad streets until he arrives at gli Studj, whence by a brisk turn to the left, he drives on to Toledo. These"], [178, "156 CHRISTMAS EVE. improvements were effected, or at least begun under the French. Another embellishment is the colonnade facing the royal palace, and the church of St. Francesco di Paola in the centre of it, built in consequence of a vow made by the present king on his restoration. The colonnade, however, loses much of its effect on account of the buildings rising on the hill im mediately behind it. On Christmas eve the city of Naples resembles a town taken by storm. A quantity of rockets of various descriptions, some weighing above a pound, are thrown out of the windows as a sign of rejoicing, to the great annoyance of the passengers. A con tinual noise is kept up in this manner till day-break. Such an irregularity in a civilized country is a matter of surprise to foreigners : but the natives seem re markable fond of boisterous diversions, and at every festival of any particular saint a considerable sum is laid out in fireworks. Government has the mono poly of gunpowder, as well as of salt and tobacco ; these form an important branch of revenue. During the nine days preceding Christmas, an evening service is performed in the churches in com memoration of the nativity of Christ, which is known by the name of la Novena di Natale ; that of the royal chapel in the palace, is distinguished by"], [179, "157 NOVENA DI NATALE. excellent singing. On this occasion I saw the king and many of the nobility attend with much devo tion. His majesty is known to be a regular, though not bigoted, observer of the practices of religious worship. A number of shepherds from the mountains of Abruzzo, and from the neighbouring Apennine regions, come to the capital regularly every year, two or three weeks before Christmas, and go about the streets playing on their bagpipes, in anticipation of the approaching festivity. Most Neapolitan fa milies engage some of these itinerant musicians to play at their houses before the image of the Virgin and Infant, for a quarter of an hour on each day of the Novena, for a trifling remuneration ; the wild appearance of these mountaineers, their un couth dress, the simplicity of their manners, and the shrill notes of their pipes, attract the attention of the traveller. At the same epoch, groups of Calabrese peasants from the other extremity of the kingdom repair to Naples with their harps, which are their national instruments. It is customary here as well as in other parts of Italy, at Christmas time, to construct in the churches and in several private houses, representations of the birth-place of our Saviour, with appropriate figures, and which are known by the name of pre sepio. Some of them are arranged with great skill,"], [180, "158 PRESEPJ. and exhibit a variety of scenery, in which the rules of perspective are well preserved. The natural taste of the Italians for the imitative arts is parti cularly remarkable on these occasions. The stable in which Christ was born, and from which the name of presepio is taken, forms of course the pro minent feature of the scene; and the landscape around it is a fanciful assemblage of groves and meadows, streams and cascades, cottages and grottoes, long vistas, and distant mountains. These models are made of a variety of materials, such as cork, wood, and turf; the figures are made of clay, very naturally painted, and in various costumes ; \u2014 shepherds with their flocks and cattle, travellers, soldiers, 8sC The details are generally elegant and picturesque, but the whole often exhibits an odd mixture of inconsistencies. I have seen a pre- sepio in the house of a lawyer, in the street of Forcelle, constructed on a large scale and in a magnificent style, containing several hundred figures, and which has cost the owner some thou- sands of ducats ; the Virgin Mary appears stand- ing dressed as a queen, under a beautiful Grecian portico, receiving the homage of kings, accompa nied by a brilliant retinue, while guards are seen with their spears keeping the multitude at a re- spectful distance. The Ottoman crescent and the imperial eagle of Austria glittered on the banners"], [181, "159 UNIVERSITY. of the royal visitors. Some of the presepii are constructed on terraces in the open air, others in apartments, and these are shown by candle-light. Free admission is given, according to the liberal custom of the Italian gentry. The University, or Scuole Pubbliche, of Naples, was formerly a college belonging to the Jesuits. In Italy these disciples of Loyola had long the public education of youth in their hands, and they seemed to be well qualified for it. Their professors were generally men of great abilities; the regulations of their colleges were wise and more liberal than is commonly imagined ; and I think that, in this country at least, public education did not gain much by the suppression of the order. Whatever the faults of that institution and the ambitious views of its chiefs might be, the individual mem bers of the society were in general highly respect able and useful ; and they cannot, consistent with justice, be accused of idleness, nor of a fanatical and persecuting spirit. The sovereigns of Europe might think it politically wise to abolish the Je suits, but the court of Rome certainly showed little wisdom or policy in conniving at their fall, and in treating with such severity its best defenders, \u2014 the champions of Catholicism. Even to this day the opinions of Italians are much divided about the expediency of that measure ; and I have"], [182, "160 JESUITS. often, during the political storms which have agi tated this country, heard the remark made, that \" these things would not have happened had not the Jesuits been suppressed.\" The reception which Frederick II., and Catherine of Russia gave to the fugitive fathers, and the bitter invectives which this conduct drew against those two sovereigns from Voltaire and his party, are arguments in favour of the Jesuits. The present remains of the order however give but a faint idea of its former great ness and glory ; and the re-establishment of the Jesuits by several of the Catholic governments of Europe, which has lately taken place, will pro bably prove inadequate to the expectations which have been founded upon it, and will only serve to increase the clamour of the discontented party, without furnishing any additional arms to oppose it. The veterans of the order are all dead, and the generality of the existing members, brought up in times of humiliation and distress, have not had the means of acquiring the qualifications of their predecessors. Stat magni nominis umbra. I have of late attended the lectures at the Uni versity.

Perhaps they have for so doing, the same reason as the preachers of this country, viz., to accommodate themselves to the taste of their audience. The lectures are accessible to any decent and orderly person. At the gate of the college a military guard is sta tioned, which would appear rather a strange sight to an English student; but such is the continental system of the day. The people of this country are much addicted to the belief of witchcraft, and of other superna tural agencies. I have often been surprised to hear persons, very sensible in other respects, talk seri ously about these matters, and relate the most extravagant stories. I was gravely told the other day by a Neapolitan acquaintance, that a witch had been found half dead, lying on the pavement in some obscure lane in the skirts of the city ; the poor hag, it seems, while soaring through the air on her way to La Noce di Benevento, a favourite place of resort, with these mysterious beings, had ventured too near a church, the sacred atmo sphere of which destroyed her spells, ,and she fell helpless to the ground. This country is also haunted by a peculiar kind of hobgoblin called by the natives il monacello, whom they describe as a short thick figure of a man dressed in the long dark Vol. I.

Credulity with regard to these matters, absurd as it may appear to foreigners, is not, however, confined here to the lower classes only. A science upon which I have heard frequent dissertations, is la magia bianca, a kind of legiti mate intercourse with invisible spirits, by which adepts obtain a knowledge of the most secret things: they have also cabalistical calculations through which they pretend to find out the prize numbers that will be drawn at the next lottery. The adepts are chiefly monks and priests, who live very re tired, are difficult of access, and speak by enigmas. I have frequently heard wonderful accounts of people winning great prizes through their means, the circumstances of which, and the authority I had them from, would almost shake my incre dulity. Some of the most celebrated among these seers have been at different times exiled by the police as obnoxious persons. A belief in the secret"], [185, "163 MAGIA BIANCA. sciences is very generally spread among all classes of Neapolitans and Sicilians, however incredulous in other respects. A German professor of music travelling lately through Sicily, arrived at Catania, where he had some respectable introductions and was received very kindly. Nature, however, had bestowed upon him a forbidding countenance; there was something mysterious in his deportment ; he appeared fond of study and retirement ; all these circumstances persuaded some of his new Sicilian acquaintances, that he was a fit person to apply to for numbers of the lottery : they therefore enticed him one day into some sequestered man- sion, and after they had him seated, they brought pen, ink, and paper before him, telling him reso- lutely, at the same time, that they would not allow him to go away until he gave them a good terno, i. e. three prize numbers for the next lottery. The astonished German stared, smiled, argued, and remonstrated, but to no purpose ; fearing the worst, he was obliged to act unwillingly the part of an impostor ; with much gravity he wrote down three numbers at random, and hastened immedi ately after to leave the place secretly, before the result of the lottery could be known. The Italian system of lottery is very simple. Every day of drawing, ninety tickets, or numbers, beginning from number one, are put in an urn, M 2"], [186, "164 ITALIAN LOTTERY. out of which five are drawn, and those persons who have been fortunate enough to guess at any of them, receive a prize in proportion to the money they have staked, and which is increased at every additional number they have guessed out of the live ; an ambo, i. e. two prize numbers, affords a premium of more than twenty times the money staked upon them, a terno, or three numbers, affords several hundred times the amount, and so on in proportion; the cinquina, or the whole of the five prize numbers, is worth several thousand ducats to the lucky guesser. The great evil of this system is, that, as people are allowed to stake as low as a few grains, or halfpence, the temptation is very great for the poor classes, who often de prive themselves and their families of the first ne cessaries of life, and sacrifice the scanty produce of their daily labour at the shrine of cupidity."], [187, "165 CHAPTER VIII. TUSCANY. I sailed from Naples in a Genoese vessel, which brought me to Leghorn after a voyage of eight dayrs. Leghorn is a place entirely mercantile. The town is neatly built ; the people have an ap pearance of affluence and comfort ; the streets are crowded ; it is the town of Italy which bears the greatest resemblance to England. The shops are fitted up almost like those in London; but a stranger, who has nothing to do with mercantile concerns, soon gets tired of Leghorn, as he cannot find in it many resources for the mind. The country about is flat and heathy ; the hill of Mon tenero is the place of resort for the wealthy inha bitants, who have their country-houses on it. There is a pleasant walk round the walls of the town, which leads by the English burying-ground ; among the tombs in the latter, that of Smollett claims the attention of the English traveller. From Leghorn I proceeded to Pisa, in one of the open coaches called timonelle. The distance"], [188, "166 PISA is about fourteen miles, the road is good, and the fare a trifle. Pisa, one of the most celebrated cities in the history of Italy, looks now depopu- lated, and melancholy; the grass grows in its fine streets, and at the very entrance of its marble buildings. This city is renowned for its mild and salubrious climate, especially in winter; living is cheap ; the people are sociable and courteous ; the place is quiet ; it is altogether a residence well adapted for an invalid, or for a studious man. The university is one cf the most celebrated in Italy : it ranks next to that of Pavia. There are several of the nobility who have conversazioni, or parties, to which strangers may easily get admittance. The Cathedral; the Campo Santo, with its ancient monuments and fresco paintings; the famous leaning tower or belfry ; and the Bap- tistery ; form a group of buildings, which might employ the attention of the traveller for several days. The view from the summit of the tower is remarkably fine. From Pisa I went to Florence, by the diligence. The road runs along the banks of the Arno, and offers some most beautiful prospects of Italian scenery. The peasantry look cheerful, the country girls dress neatly and smartly. I arrived at Flo rence in the evening. Much has been written upon this celebrated city ; I shall therefore confine"], [189, "EFFECTS OF FRENCH INVASION. 167 myself in great measure to some remarks upon the moral features of the people. Whether the intellectual state* and civil con dition of the Italians in general, and of the Tuscans more particularly, have improved or deteriorated during the years of French dominion, may appear a question to some. But to me it seems evident, that foreign invasion, military despotism, conscrip tions and contributions, increase of taxes, and an nihilation of maritime commerce, could not pro mote the welfare of a nation ; and that they must, on the contrary, have been the ruin of domestic happiness, as well as of private fortunes, which is an evil not easily compensated by a refinement in the luxuries of life, nor by the construction of a few roads and public buildings, nor even by some improvement in the laws of a country, especially when the government remains arbitrary. The French have at last derived some real advantages, though dearly purchased, from their successive revolutions ; but the unfortunate Italians have lost by the last changes even those scanty cempen sations which palliated in their eyes the evils of a foreign yoke ; they have for the most part returned to their ancient system of government and laws, * There is a distinction to be made here, which I shall explain at full length in giving an historical sketch of the Italian republic, and of the kingdom of Italy."], [190, "168 EFFECTS OF FRENCH INVASION. without that tranquillity of mind, and that unim paired wealth, which made Italy a happy country, even under its divided and imperfect political system, before the French invasion. Contented with their humble destinies, although a faint sigh now and then escaped them at the recollection of former glories, the Italians, -wisely turned the ef forts of their genius to the peaceful pursuits of the arts and sciences. A lovely nature, and all the wonders of man's creation, were to them a happy compensation for the loss of turbulent liberty and bloody triumphs. Their governments, secure in their comparative insignificance, held with gentle hands the loosened reins; opposite parties had blended together, in consequence of long peace; despotism existed more in theory than in practice ; Catholicism was more tolerant and enlightened here than in any other country ; even the inquisition, a shadow of which existed in one or two states, was stripped of its terrors ; and travellers who visited Italy bore witness to the practical freedom which was enjoyed in that happy land. By the French invasion all was changed. Discord revived ancient feuds under new names; political dissensions ran higher perhaps in Italy than in any other country of Europe ; and these are still far from having subsided. Military habits, of the rudest sort, acquired under the sway of Napoleon, while they"], [191, "169 EFFECTS OF FRENCH INVASION. took away that elegance and suavity of manner for which the Italians were so remarkable, added a grosser load of corruption to their already lax morals, and by destroying the principles of re ligion, removed that salutary check, remorse, which often leads to repentance and amendment. The open gaiety of the Italian character sank under the miseries they suffered ; its benevolence was lost ; and even the delicacy of their language was impaired by the encroachments of a foreign domineering tongue, ill adapted to the genius and to the feel ings of the children of music and love*. The French introduced their multifarious and onmplicated sys tem of administration ; they established their op pressive inquisitorial police, and the still more op pressive conscription ; they loaded the people with taxes unknown before ; they sowed discord between the different classes of society : the French, their armies, and their generals, are gone ; but the evil effects remain, a sad memorial of their unwelcome visit. And what have the Italians acquired in exchange for peace, happiness, pleasure, and * When I mention the French, I do not intend to speak invidiously of this nation, which, with all its peculiarities, is one of the most interesting in Europe ; but I allude to their rulers, during the republican and imperial regimes, and to those delegates who were sent to direct the affairs of poor Italy ; some of the latter had the will, but not the power, of doing effectual good to that country."], [192, "170 EFFECTS OF FRENCH INVASION. wealth ? Alas ! nothing : for it had never been the intention of their invaders to establish the unity and independence of Italy. The Italian youth, it is true, distinguished themselves in the ranks of the French armies, by their bravery and abilities worthy of a better cause ; but on all occasions the profit turned entirely to the advan- tage of their overbearing allies, and the loss alone was theirs: Italy fought \" per servir sempre, o vincitrice, o vinta.\" And well the French knew how to stimulate the noble passions of the Italians ; they addressed themselves even to the vanity of the weaker sex, and Bonaparte gravely said in one of his proclamations, that in future the Italian fair should only listen to lovers covered with honour- able scars \u2014 scars received in fighting for a foreign conqueror ! What a perversion of sense ! Well might one apply to the Italians those impressive lines of a modern poet, addressed to the Greeks : \"Hereditary bondsmen ! know ye not Who would be free themselves must strike the blow? By their right arms the conquest must be wrought ? Will Gaul or Muscovite redress ye ? no !\" There were old abuses and partial evils in Italy at the epoch of the French invasion, to correct which the hand of a skilful and humane physician was required; but, instead of this, a swarm of quacks, foreign and native, fastened upon Italy,"], [193, "171 FLORENCE. some to try their crude experiments, others to seek their own advantage. I have written the above remarks with full sin cerity; having lived in Italy before, during, and after, the French occupation, and being enabled therefore to make comparisons. Florence is beautifully situated. That verdant amphitheatre of smiling hills, overtopped by the frowning dark Apennines, \u2014 those fertile valleys watered by the Arno and its tributary streams, and strewed with elegant villas and neat cottages, \u2014 > the air of cleanliness and gentility by which the inhabitants distinguish themselves from the rest of the Italians, \u2014 the purity of their language, \u2014 the splendour and cleanliness of the hotels and coffee houses, \u2014 a city, full of statues, monuments, and re markable buildings, \u2014 all these advantages, which have acquired to Florence the name of the Athens of Italy, render it a delightful residence. The churches in general do not appear to advantage on the outside ; the rough appearance of the bricks on the exterior of most of them ill corresponds with the magnificence of the interior. The cathedral, Santa Maria in Fiore, is a vast building, the facade of which has never been finished ; and the interior appears neglected and gloomy, compared with the magnificent churches of Rome. Its dome, by Brunellesco, however, which was the admiration of"], [194, "172 CHURCH OF SANTA CROCE. Michael Angelo, is said to have given the idea of that of St. Peter's. The Battisterio, 11 bel San Giovanni of Dante, is a most interesting monument of the wealth and spirit of republican Florence. The square detached belfry is striking, by its bold structure and the profusion of marbles of various colours with which it is, as well as the outside of the church, entirely covered. In Santa Croce, the Pantheon of Florence, are the mausoleums of Galileo, Macchiavelli, Michel Angelo and Alfieri. That of Michel Angelo, or namented by the statues of the three sister arts, architecture, sculpture, and painting, is particularly remarkable. The tomb of Alfieri, a name dear to Italians, is the work of Canova, and made of fine white marble : the statue of Italy, with the mural crown on her head, is leaning upon the tomb, in the attitude of lamenting the loss of her favourite son. This monument was erected by Countess Stolberg, Duchess of Albany, during the time the whole of Italy was under the dominion of the French : the figure of Italy is dressed in a fine drapery ; a wit wrote on the pedestal the following epigram : Canova, questa volta I' hai sbagliata ; Fai 1' Italia vestita, ma e spogliata. This church contains many paintings ; among the rest a fine fresco, which represents the limbo,"], [195, "173 TOMBS OF THE HOUSE OF MEDICI. or place of penance, where, according to Catholic theology, the righteous of the Old Testament were detained until, Jesus rescued them, and where the souls of infants unbaptized are confined till the day of judgment. Some of the figures are beautiful, although damaged by time ; the painting is kept covered, but strangers may see it on application. Among the remarkable churches of Florence are Sta. Maria Novella and San Marco, both of which contain excellent paintings, and are also well known for their adjoining pharmacies and perfumeries, which are kept by the industrious monks ; and the church of S. Spirito, the architecture of Brunellesco. I shall not describe here the magnificent finery of the sepulchral chapel of the Medici in St. Lorenzo, too rich and gaudy for the object of its erection ; but I must pause in the sacristy to admire Michel Angelo's works. Reclining on one side of a tomb, her left arm supporting her head, sits the statue of Night ; she sleeps, but seems to breathe as if she were going to awake the next moment ; her bosom and legs are bare and beautiful : anatomical per fection is conspicuous in Michel Angelo's works, but here he has added softness of features, grace fulness of form, and an exquisite polish, not sur passed, perhaps, by any. Unfortunately he left this charming figure unfinished, and no one has at tempted to try his chisel upon it after that of Buo-"], [196, "174 FLORENTINE ARCHITECTURE. narotL Some verses which were written at the time about this statue, alluding to its expected awak ening, gave occasion to Michel Angelo's reply in the following verses, which he put in the mouth of Night, and which relate to the political dissensions of his age : \u2014 Grato mi e il Sonno e piu 1'esser' di sasso, Mentre ehe il danno e la vergogna dura ; Non veder' non sentir' m' e gran' ventura ; Percio non mi destar : deh parla basso.\" Most of the streets of Florence are narrow; the buildings are lofty and ancient looking, the palaces massive and ponderous, hke so many for tresses, all which throws a shade of gloom over the interior of the city. The venerable Palazzo Ver chio, once the Government-house, the palaces, Ric cardi (built by the first Cosmo de' Medici,) Strozzi, and the palazzo Pitti, the residence of the Grand Dukes, are peculiarly striking for their imposing, but heavy and cheerless, appearance. Even the Uffizj, or great repository of the national museum, partakes of this fault. The architecture of Flo rence dates from the thirteenth century ; Arnolfo di Lapo, disciple of Cimabue, Giotto, Brunel leschi, Buonaroti, and Vasari, were its most cele brated masters. Some structures on the Lung' Arno, or quays, along the river, are more elegantly built ; among these the palace Corsini deserves notice. But when you emerge out of the populous part of"], [197, "175 PUBLIC WALKS. the city and ascend the ramparts, or issue out of the gates, and behold the neighbouring hills covered with gardens and casini, then Florence resumes all its attractions. The gardens of Boboli, annexed to the palace Pitti, which is the residence of the Grand Duke, are very extensive, and enclosed within the walls of the town. In them all is art, little is left to nature; the avenues are straight, the trees cut into walls and ornaments ; the two basins are of marble, and adorned with some fine statues ; but the whole plan is too symmetrical. How inferior to some of the Roman villas, particularly to the villa Borghese, and to its delightful groves and its beautiful lake, such, at least, as they were some years ago ; for now, they have made sad alterations in them. The gardens of Boboli are adorned with many statues ; the group of Adam and Eve, by Naccarini, is particularly admired. Florence abounds with beautiful walks in its neighbourhood ; every gate leads to some of them. There is the Prato, out of Porta San Gallo, or Bologna Gate ; Poggio Imperiale near Porta Ro mana; but the Cascine, out of Porta di Prato, are the most delightful of all. While the central avenues are crowded with splendid equipages which are seen glittering through the foliage of the trees, how pleasant it is on a fine summer eve to ramble"], [198, "176 CHARACTER OF THE TUSCANS. on the solitary path which skirts the bank of the peaceful Arno, while the sun issetting beyond the woody hills of the west ! The hill of Fiesole, out of Porta Pinti, affords also some romantic walks ; the tributary stream Mugnone has there its source, and forms some pretty cascades in miniature ; the view of the country about Florence, from the an cient town of Fiesole, on the summit of the hill, is very grand. In short, the neighbourhood of Flo rence affords inexhaustible gratifications to the pe destrian, and to the admirer of nature, with this advantage, over other Italian countries, that he may ramble at any time, or to any distance, without being afraid of unpleasant rencontres. The Tuscans are the gentlest of the Italians ; they seem well calculated to inhabit their fine country, which is justly called the garden of Italy. The superiority of their manners above those of other Italians is striking. They are sociable, polite, and courteous to strangers ; and their conversation is both instructive and attractive. They are lively and witty, especially the Florentines, and rather inclined to satirical effusions. There is no real po pulace in Florence ; the lower classes are orderly, cheerful, and civil, and as polished, to say the least, as the middle classes of other Italian cities. Their dress is neat, and they have greater taste for clean liness than any of their neighbours. Crimes of a"], [199, "177 CHARACTER OF THE TUSCANS. black dye, such as murder and highway robbery, which disgrace the southern states of Italy, are very rare amongst them : their natural mildness had, probably, a share in the determination of the late Grand Duke Leopold, to abolish the pain of death. I have been assured, that in the course of many years under his reign, only one instance of murder occurred in his dominions, and that one was com mitted by a foreigner, belonging to the Papal ter ritories. Criminals were then sent to work at the ferriere, iron mines, in the maremme, or low lands of the province of Sienna, a very unwholesome country in the summer ; and that punishment was, perhaps, worse than death itself. As a balance for their amiable qualities, the Tuscans are accused, perhaps not altogether with out some foundation, of having an ample share of the vices which often accompany a highly refined state of society. Effeminacy, libertinism, dissi mulation, and avarice, have been imputed to them by other Italians. Tuscany having existed for a long time as a small state, under an arbi trary though mild government, obliged to keep peace, and to court the friendship of its more power ful neighbours, it is not extraordinary that the Tuscans have not of late been renowned for mili tary character ; but the history of their republics, and of their wars in the middle ages, sufficiently Vol. I. N"], [200, "178 CHARACTER OF THE TUSCANS. shows that their ancestors were not deficient in this quality. The same causes, and the jealous and oppressive rule of the second house of Medici, may be assigned as the origin of their alleged insin cerity ; and relaxation of morals was the natural consequence produced by long peace upon a gay people, living under a lovely climate in one of the finest regions of the world. As for their excessive parsimony, which is proverbial in Italy, it may in great measure have originated from the smallness of their incomes ; few families in Tuscany are pos sessed of large fortunes, but a moderate competence and comfort are generally spread throughout the land, which in such a small state is a happy condi tion of society. The Tuscans are a well made race of men. Their women are rather handsome ; they have generally good complexions, and are inclined to embonpoint : the country girls are sunburnt ; but they have fine figures, and brilliant eyes, and the whole play of their expressive physiognomy is very attractive. They are spirited and witty, and it is not safe for a man to enter into a contest of words with them, as they have such a fluency of speech, and their memory is so stored with sayings, proverbs, and bon mots, that they generally get the laughers on their side. There is an appearance of comfort, and a cheerful look among the peasantry, such as one"], [201, "179 THEIR HABITS AND MANNERS. does not meet frequently with in the south of Italy. Their manufactories of straw hats, which are very common amongst the country people, and at which the females work, are an additional resource to them. Straw, or black beaver hats are the common head dress of peasant girls, and the addition of flowers or showy ribbons, tastefully arranged, sets off to advantage their sprightly and expressive features. The uprlcr classes, although living economically in the interior of their houses, display much luxury in their equipages ; and show great taste in their country-houses, which, if not magnificent, are cer tainly very elegant, although strange to say, most of the owners live in preference in their sombre town residences. It is astonishing to see the number of these villas in the neighbourhood of the capital . they amount to several thousands, scattered over the beautiful hills that surround Florence ; which made Ariosto say, that if they were all collected within walls, they would form a city twice as large as Rome. Se dentro a un mur sotto un raedesmo nome Fosser raccolti i tuoi palagi sparsi Non ti sarian da pareggiar due Rome. The modern Tuscans are people easily ruled by a gentle sway. They still remember gratefully the reign of Leopold, the predecessor of the present grand duke ; he was really a liberal-minded despot, N 2"], [202, "180 GRAND DUKE LEOPOLD. and strove to render his people as happy as he could. He diminished the influence of the court of Rome, without openly quarrelling with it ; he suppressed several convents, and limited the number of novices, without abolishing altogether the monastic orders ; he distributed the taxes equally ; encouraged trade ; allowed a considerable degree of freedom to his subjects; in short, he deserved the title of the father of his people. Many anecdotes are related of him. One day he was sjjeaking to some Mussulman envoy, about the Santons and Fakirs of the east, who are held in veneration often for the sole reason of their being supposed to be mad. In our country, says he, we have also a similar sort of madmen, but we shut them up in buildings like that, pointing to a convent which stood opposite. Leopold, however, when taken out of the con tracted sphere of his beloved Tuscany, and placed at the head of the first empire in Europe, became as it were eclipsed. His measures were wavering; he could not pursue on a large scale what he had begun on a diminutive one ; his strength and resolu tion seemed to fail him, just when he had most occasion for them ; he was suspected by all parties of insincerity, when sudden death overtook him in time to save the remains of his reputation as a statesman. The present grand Duke Ferdinand seems to"], [203, "181 HIS SUCCESSOR FERDINAND. have inherited, if not the abilities, at least the milder virtues of his predecessor ; the people at large are attached to him, as they are to his family, whom they look upon as Italians, born and brought up in Tuscany. They were pleased with his restora tion, although they complain of his having been since too much influenced by his relatives of the house of Austria. The great mass of the Tuscans, and of the Italians in general, were never friendly nor heartily attached to the French. Eppure Ferdinando had a tornare, they exclaimed, while under the rule of Maria Louisa of Spain, duchess of Parma ; whom Napoleon made queen of Etruria in 1801, and whom he turned out in 1807, when he incorporated Tuscany with the French empire. Elisa Baciocchi, Napoleon's eldest sister, ruled then Tuscany for several years, with the title of Grande Duchesse, although she was in reality no more than a subordinate agent of her brother. As such she cannot perhaps, with justice, be made ac countable for the arbitrary acts which she enforced, in obedience to her imperial relative ; but she also displayed a haughtiness and a harshness which dis gusted the gentle Florentines. She took frequent opportunities of humbling the nobility, who in this country are more unassuming than in other parts of Italy ; and many anecdotes are related of her haughty overbearing disposition, by which, as well"], [204, "182 PRINCESS ELISA. as by her features, she appears to have resembled her brother Napoleon more than any of her sisters. Abundance of scandalous reports also circulate about the manners of her court. She certainly did not conciliate the minds of the inhabitants ; who, at her departure in 1814, gave her unequivocal marks of dislike. Her husband, Baciocchi, originally an Italian, and formerly an officer in the French armies, was a mere cipher, and had no share in the business of government, for which he did not seem calculated, and of which, happily for him, he was not ambitious. He, however, on his being appointed prince of Lucca, was induced to change his christian name of Pascal, which in Italy sounds vulgar, and is subject to ridicule, being often used as synonymous to that of dunce, into the more dig nified one of Felix the first ; upon which occasion some Tuscan wit produced the following epigram : Quando tu eri Pasquale, uoi eravam tutti felici ; Or ehe tu sei Felice, noi siam tutti Pasquali. He was a harmless good-natured man, and seems to have understood his own mediocrity ; for when the gentlemen of Lucca apologized to him for their possible deficiencies in their new capacity of cour tiers, saying that they were not accustomed to the situation (Lucca having been until then a republic,) he is said to have replied good-humouredlv : \" We"], [205, "AUSTRIANS. 183 will excuse one another mutually, gentlemen, as I am also a novice in my present situation.\" The Austrians, who succeeded the French in the temporary possession of Tuscany, did not, how ever, know better than them how to win the affec tions of this people. The Florentines were glad to get rid of them, although they say that the grand duke paid several millions to the court of Vienna as a compensation. The Austrians, on their first return to Italy, seem to have disgusted the Italians in general, by their moroseness, par simony, and haughtiness ; and by their hving at discretion upon them, not as deliverers, but as con querors. This, however, was perhaps unavoidable in the exhausted state of the imperial exchequer, after a succession of disastrous wars against the French. It is also well known that the latter had behaved much worse on their first invasion. I wish to be just to all parties, as much as it is pos sible in this epoch of exaggeration and misrepre sentation ; and I am aware that the faults of the Austrian government in Italy have been much magnified. I shall have an opportunity of speak ing fully on this subject in my historical sketch of Milan and Lombardy, which is the part of Italy now under the sway of Austria. The government of Tuscany is absolute, like that of all the other Italian states, but is tempered"], [206, "184 PRESENT ADMINISTRATION. with so much mildness and moderation, as to render this country the happiest in Italy. The present administration, at the head of which are Fossom broni and Neri Corsini, is enlightened, and seems to enjoy the confidence of the sovereign as well as of the people. The representatives of several of the noble families of this country, the Capponi, the Pucci, the Ridolfi, the Ginori, and others, are zealously engaged in the truly patriotic task of en couraging among their countrymen, arts, sciences, and letters, which several of them cultivate with success. They have founded schools of mutual in struction. They are now endeavouring to establish at Florence a permanent dramatic company. In short, they are busy in promoting the information and welfare of the people, and, what is more to their credit, they do it in a wise, legitimate, and unaffected manner. These, however, and many more noblemen of other states of Italy who are following the same course at Milan, Turin, Venice, Bologna, and Naples, are members of that Italian aristocracy which has been stigmatized in such a sweeping manner by several foreign travellers, and repre sented as being a degenerated, dissipated, and use less caste, engrossed by trifles, and destitute of energy and liberality ! There are, of course, abuses in Tuscany, and several of these abuses must be derived from the"], [207, "185 OLD TUSCAN REPUBLICS. original fault in the principle of Government; but it is nevertheless certain, that of all Italians the Tuscans have the least reason to complain of their present situation. As for the lamentations about the former glory of their old republics, \u2014 when in this small territory of six thousand square miles, there were half a dozen separate states ; when Florence, Pisa, Sienna, Pistoja, Arezzo, and other cities, were continually at variance with one another; when Tuscans fought against Tuscans, destroy ed and plundered each other, and made their countrymen prisoners; when they were harassed by internal factions, attacked by foreign tyrants, ex posed to the encroachment of Popes, Emperors, Kings of France, and Kings of Naples; \u2014 it would be worse than idle cant to regret such a state of things which, besides, would be absolutely imprac ticable in the modern state of Europe. We have only to read the accounts of their own historians, and the descriptions of their poets, and we shall see what was the condition of the citizens of the Tuscan republics before the Medici. Cosmo and Lorenzo, those two great men of the first House of Medici, who, by their real merit, rose to have the power, without having the title of sovereigns, united the different states of Tus cany, and brought their country to the highest degree of splendour. The second House of Medici,"], [208, "186 TWO HOUSES OF MEDICI. however, were a different race ; they established their authority through foreign assistance, and the Tuscans felt the baneful effects of their suspicious and inquisitorial power. When Tuscany and Austria were under Leopold, a new spirit was dif fused into this people, and the impulsion which that Prince gave has continued since to influence their character, even through all the vicissitudes of the last thirty years. If the activity and spirit of inquiry of the Tuscans continue to be accom panied by sober judgment, they will still go on im proving their situation, and be of great service to the rest of Italy. Besides this, living is cheap, the climate tem perate, the country beautiful, and adorned with the monuments of the arts; society is agreeable; an air of gaiety and satisfaction is spread on the countenances of men and females ; amusement and instruction are both easily procured; \u2014 what more can the Tus cans wish for ? Although impoverished by foreign rapacity, this country has already, in great measure, recovered from its losses, and if left in peace, will continue to improve : nature is so bountiful to it ! The harbour of Leghorn, the only real free port of Italy, is a source of wealth to Tuscany ; it is the grand depot of foreign produce, and the whole town is included in its freedom. It is frequented by vessels of all nations ; and its commodious laz-"], [209, "187 STATE OF SOCIETY. zarettos, and wise quarantine regulations, afford security against the plague, that dreadful scourge of the Mediterranean. All religions are tolerated at Leghorn, and enjoy the free exercise of their worship ; there are chapels of the different Chris tian sects ; synagogues for the Jews ; and not long ago even the Mussulmans had there a mosque. There are every day diligences between Leghorn and Florence, in which one rides a distance of sixty-seven miles in about ten or eleven hours ; the charge inside is three dollars a head. This is the only establishment of the kind in South Italy, where the vetturini still monopolize the travelling business. Society here is pleasant. A certain degree of in formation is generally spread ; many scientific and literary men are to be met in this city ; several en terprising and wealthy booksellers carry on their trade, and rival those of Milan. In fact, these two cities are now the two great literary marts of Italy. Circulating libraries have long been established at Florence, although on a small scale ; but within a few years a new establishment of this sort has risen, which is, perhaps, the first of the kind in Italy. It is called the Gabinetto Scientifico eLet terario, and is kept in the best style; besides a good library, the best Italian, French, English, and German newspapers and periodicals, are there"], [210, "188 LITERATURE. to be found. Its central situation in the Palazzo Buondelmonte, near the fine bridge of Sta.Trinita, is an advantage ; the proprietor spares no trouble to please his subscribers as well as his accidental visitors *. He is at the same time the Editor of the Antologia, an Italian literary journal, published monthly, and uniting the attributes of a magazine and review. The Antologia and La Biblioteca Italiand of Milan, are by far the two best con ducted works of the sort in Italy, being supported by contributors of known literary merit. The language of the Tuscans is considered to be the pure Italian ; it is spoken nearly as genuine by the lower as by the upper classes, \u2014 an agreeable peculiarity not to be found in any other part of Italy, where the dialects of the vulgar are quite distinct from the Italian which is spoken in good company. It must be observed, however, that the Tuscans employ many words idiomatic or recherches, which are discarded by the Italian literati of other countries, who consider the use of them as savouring of affectation, and of a too * I may be allowed to praise this establishment, although tbe proprietor is a namesake and relative of mine, since it has been already favourably mentioned by several travellers, as being an agreeable and useful novelty in Italy.

A striking contrast between the jargon of a fanatical Cruscante, and the plain elegant Italian of Tasso, is found in one of Goldoni's comedies, called Torquato Tasso, one of the most amusing productions of that celebrated dramatist. Another strong objection against the language of the Tuscans, is their guttural pronunciation, by which the letter c, when placed before the vowels a, o, u, is changed into a strongly as pirated h, which gives to their words a twang far from agreeable to the ear, and certainly not con sistent with Italian harmony and softness. It makes their conversation at first unintelligible to a stranger ; so much so, that an Englishman of my acquaintance, who understood Italian tolerably well, said, on his arrival at Florence, that he thought the people were talking Spanish. Lingua Toscana in bocca Romana, is an old hackneyed proverb ; still I am of opinion that it is at Rome, among the educated classes, that one hears the genuine Italian spoken in its purity ; \u2014 the Italian of Tasso and of Metastasio. Florence is a most agreeable residence for a o person fond of the arts ; indeed such is the display\" of statues, relievos, and pictures, that I almost think any man would acquire a taste for them in this atmosphere. The gallery is one of the richest"], [212, "190 WORKS OF ART. museums in Europe; its numerous master-pieces of sculpture and painting have been described in every language. The collection of busts of the Roman Emperors is most complete, in the best preservation, and arranged with great judgment and taste. The medals and cameos form another antl not less valuable treasure. Under the neighbouring Loggia de' Lanzi, and on the square before the Palazzo Vecchio, are several statues and groupes by Michel Angelo, Bandinelli, Cellini, and Bologna. Other works of these artists are scattered in several parts of the city. The principal libraries of Florence are the Laurenziana, the Riccardiana, and the Maglia becchiana, rich in manuscripts and rare books. Several academies exist in this city ; \u2014 the academy of the fine arts, to which Benvenuti, and Morghen belong; that of the Georgofili for the encourage ment of agriculture, and industry ; and the Aca demia Fiorentina, which has succeeded that of La Crusca, in its assumed authority over the Italian language. Before I leave Southern Italy, I will say something of Italian women, a subject, particularly interesting. Much has been said of the grace and beauty of the women of Italy, and much also of the levity of their conduct and of the looseness of their morals. The latter, I am inclined to think, have been often"], [213, "191 ITALIAN WOMEN. exaggerated; many travellers are apt to judge of a whole nation from the inhabitants of towns, and of these they form their opinion, from one or two classes, of which they have only known a few in dividuals. It is necessary to be well acquainted with the manners, language, and humour of the inhabitants of a country ; to live with them for a long time ; and to identify one self with them ; in order to estimate them properly. A stranger is apt to infer criminal conduct from appearances of indelicacy, and to measure every thing by the standard of his own land. The middling classes, which form a numerous and respectable part of every nation, are generally less known to him than the upper and the popular ones. Italy and England are undoubtedly possessed of a greater share of female beauty than any other country in Europe. But the English and Italian beauties, although both interesting, are very different from one another. The former are unri valled for the delicacy and bloom of their com plexions, the smoothness and mild expression of their features, their modest carriage, and the clean liness of their persons and dress ; these are qualities which strike every foreigner at his landing. On my first arrival in England, I was asked by a friend how I liked the English women, to which I replied that I thought them all handsome. This"], [214, "192 ITALIAN WOMEN. is the first impression they produce. There is an air of calmness and pensiveness about them, which surprises and interests particularly a native of the south. They seem to look, if I may apply to them the fine lines of one of their living poets : With eyes so pure, that from their ray Dark vice would turn abash'd away ; * * * * * * * Yet fill'd with all youth's sweet desires, Mingling the meek and vestal fires Of other worlds, with all the bliss The fond weak tenderness of this. The Italian beauties are of a different kind. Their features are more regular, more animated ; their complexions bear the marks of a warmer sun, and their eyes seem to participate of its fires ; their carriage is graceful and noble ; they have generally good figures ; they are not indeed angelic forms, but they are earthly Venuses. It has been sup posed by some that the habitual view of those models of ideal beauty, the Greek statues, with which Italy abounds, may be an indirect cause con ducing to the general beauty of the sex ; be that as it may, I think the fine features and beautiful forms of the Italian fair have a great influence upon the minds of young artists, and this is per haps one of the principal reasons why Italy has so long excelled in figure painters. A handsome female countenance, animated by the expression of"], [215, "193 THEIR APPEARANCE. the soul, is among the finest works of nature ; the sight of it elevates the mind, and kindles the sparks of genius. Raphael took the models of his charm ing Madonnas from nature. Titian, Guido, Ca racci, and others, derived their ideas of female beauty from the exquisite countenances so frequent in their native country. In the north of Italy women are taller and fairer than in the south, and this difference is par ticularly striking in the peasantry. The Tuscan country girls are in general handsome ; those of Lombardy and Piedmont are more homely, but still ruddy, healthy, and gay; while the female peasantry in some parts of the Roman and Neapo litan states, worn out by a life of toil and want \u2014 scorched by a burning sun, and labouring under the influence of a poisoned atmosphere \u2014 sunk in ignorance, apathy, and filth, are mostly remarkable for their pale looks and squalid appearance ; yet, even amongst them, one may trace the fine contour of the Italian features, and a vivid expression which still lingers in the half-extinguished eye. But, if from the low and unhealthy regions of the ma remma, one proceeds to the mountains of Abruzzo, Sabina, and Umbria, a striking difference is imme diately perceived in the women, owing to the bene ficial influence of a wholesome air ; and the Italian Vol. 1. \u00b0"], [216, "194 CHARACTER OF ITALIAN WOMEN. glance and the Italian smile are expressed on every countenance. With respect to their character, the Italian women have several qualities in common with other southern females, such as those of Spain and Greece. Love is the predominant passion in Italy ; almost every other is subservient to it ; its influence and power, and the different shapes in which it affects its vo taries, are shewn by the national poetry and songs, in wliich sentiments are frequently found that to a foreigner seem exaggerated, but which are per fectly natural to the Italians. Love with them is the business of life : it is the source of affection or hatred, generosity or revenge, of joy or despair, of life or death. Young and old submit to its sway, and no one is ashamed to confess himself its slave. Fate I'amore ? chi e la vostra innamo rata ? are common questions in Italy, and ordinary topics of familiar conversation. What are the causes of this universal bias, especially among women ?

Kept under the watchful eyes of their parents or guar dians, debarred from the intercourse of men, their principal resource is the balcony, which is thrown open during a great part of the year ; there they pass whole hours, working, and looking on at the same time at the people in the houses opposite, or at those who pass in the street ; there they often make acquaintance with some young man, and keep up a sort of mute dialogue with him, from which begins the whole drama of courtship and love. The Passeggio or public walk, which, in most Italian towns, is in some of the principal streets, on Sundays and other holidays, affords young women a good opportunity of seeing and of being seen. The Cor so at Rome, Toledo at Naples, Porta Orientale at Milan, / Portici at Turin, and Strada Nova at Genoa, are all famous places for the display of female beauty. > Devotion and love are often closely allied in an Italian woman.

The character of Clementina, as described in Grandison, is by no means rare amongst Italian females. When be reaved of the object of their affections, they fade like roses deprived of the dew of heaven, and they resort to the bosom of religion, as the only consola tion which is left them in this world. They em brace with a romantic ardour the monastic life, and submit willingly and almost cheerfully to its pri vations and tediousness ; even the idea of death loses its terrors, and they see in the next world an asylum of bliss, where, freed from all the obstacles created by men and by men's laws, they will join their lovers for eternity, and where they will say with the poet : Questi ehe mai da me non fia diviso. This exquisite sensibility of the Italian women is"], [219, "197 NUNNERIES. generally allied to a certain degree of the melancholy which is characteristic of the natives of the south, and which makes them sometimes feel the emptiness of the pleasures of this world, and wish for the purer and more exalted enjoyments which are pro mised to us in the next. This disposition of the mind, this void of the heart, is one of the sources by which nunneries were filled. Several years ago a Neapolitan lady of rank, rich and independent, and in the bloom of life, who had led a round of pleasure, and mixed in all the gaieties of the world, assembled her friends one day, and after entertain ing them with a sumptuous dinner, she retired apparently in high spirits. An hour afterwards, having ordered her carriage, she drove to the con vent of Le Eremite, where, after dismissing her attendants, to whom she delivered a sealed letter for her brothers, communicating to them her final resolution, she entered the gates of the nunnery, which, closing behind her, separated her for ever from the world. No one knew the reasons which led her to this strange determination. The convent of Le Eremite is the strictest in Naples ; the nuns have no communication with any person without their walls, excepting with their confessor ; they are not acquainted with any thing that happens in the world, and their friends are not even apprised of their deaths. The house is enclosed within the"], [220, "198 ITALIAN WOMEN. precincts of another nunnery, that of Suor' Orsola, and it is by means of the inmates of the latter, that they receive their provisions and other necessaries of life. They enjoy, however, from their grated windows, the splendid and animated scene of the bay of Naples ; which, it is to be hoped for the peace of their minds, does not recall memories of past happiness, and that longing after terrestrial plea sures, which would disturb the tranquil resignation so necessary to a recluse. The latter part of the sketch I have attempted to draw of Italian women may appear fanciful and romantic ; yet I can assure my readers that it is taken from facts, though I by no means intend to imply that it is applicable to the generality. I have represented their minds in a state of exalta- tion, to which the females of this country have certainly a natural tendency, but which is more or less developed according to circumstances. This disposition leads many of them out of the regular path, it is true ; yet even in their errors there is often a spirit of generosity, which keeps them above total degradation. There is always a degree of exaltation attending passionate feelings, while there is nothing but mean baseness in selfishness and vanity. An Italian woman when led on by passion follows headlong the dictates of her heart; she sacrifices herself\u2014 her reputation\u2014 her all\u2014 to the"], [221, "199 THEIR AMIABLE QUALITIES. object of her affection : womanhood or fame are nothing more to her, and if she meets with coldness and dereliction she is miserable beyond description. We may blame, but yet must pity her, and leave her failings to the mercy of that Being who can best read the secrets of the human heart. If, however, an Italian female is so favoured by circumstances, as to meet with a worthy object, and a legitimate attachment, then she becomes the most amiable of creatures. There is such a fund of affection in her heart, her looks are so impassionate, her language is so soft, her manners so engaging, that she proves a treasure to the man who knows how to appreciate her. She can put up with any inconvenience and privation for his sake. The Italian women are in general good-natured, com passionate, and kind ; they are naturally gay, more inclined to smile than to frown ; endowed by na ture with rich mental gifts, they have shone in the career of sciences, letters, and the fine arts, whenever education, or circumstances, have favoured them. When their understanding sare not cultivated they seem to want something to occupy their thoughts, but this void lasts only as long as their hearts are disengaged ; the passion of love changes their cha racter, and they become serious, thoughtful, and melancholy."], [222, "200 STATE OF MORALS. The southern nations are more inclined to en thusiasm than those of the north. The contempla tion of nature in all her beauty ; that kind of listless weariness which is the effect of the climate ; nights of calm and loveliness ; the little want one feels for society in a country where an evening walk or a lounge on a terrace are often substituted for crowded assemblies and close parties; \u2014 all these render soli tude agreeable, and solitude produces pensiveness and enthusiasm. The mind uninterrupted by the trifling cares of vanity, and unfettered by the shackles of the world, has full leisure to nurse and cherish one single idea, one remembrance, which, by degrees, becomes an essential part of existence. To those who are well acquainted with Italy, it is not unknown that Italian girls, notwithstanding the temptations to which they are exposed, come to the nuptial altar unspotted and unsullied. As for married women, the custom of having a patito or cavalier servente (the name of cicisbeo has been long out of fashion) must be understood to be con fined to the inhabitants of cities, and, among these, chiefly to the upper classes. The bourgeois, and the lower people, even at Genoa, which is looked upon as the very land of cicisbeism, never adopted the custom ; and husbands and wives of these classes live in as good domestic understanding as those of"], [223, "201 STATE OF MORALS. any other country. With regard to the inhabi tants of the provinces, that is to say, two-thirds of the Italians, they still entertain much respect for marriage vows and marriage duties ; and if instances occur of their breaking them, the infraction is attended with as much disgrace, and as many evil consequences, as in any transalpine country. The provincial husbands still retain some of the old proverbial jealousy of the Italians, and their wives show great submission and respect towards them. In this particular, the occupation of the country by foreign military has spread a certain degi'ee of corruption; but in the remote and mountainous provinces, there is yet a great deal of patriarchal simplicity and virtue. In the Riviere of Genoa, in the valleys of the Alps and of the Apennines, and even in many districts of the Roman and Neapolitan states, the people are simple, vir tuous, and religious ; attached to their families, regular in their conduct, peaceful, satisfied, and happy. Resuming all that I have stated, I am really persuaded that, with the exception of some great cities, as Venice and Naples, there is not more cor ruption in Italy than in other parts of the continent; and that it is chiefly owing to the free unreserved manners of the inhabitants, their mode of living as"], [224, "202 STATE OF \"MORALS. it were in public, and their constitutional joviality and familiarity, that strangers are apt to form hasty conclusions to the disadvantage of the Italian sex, of which a more intimate acquaintance would shew them the fallacy."], [225, "203 \u25a0 CHAPTER IX. LOMBARDY. I left Florence in a vetturino coach, and pro ceeded across the Apennines to Bologna. The carriage was old fashioned and uncomfortable, as the generality of them are, holding six people inside, and drawn by four horses, which dragged us along at the rate of thirty miles a day, making a halt of two hours in the middle of the day, and stopping at night. The horses are never changed during the journey, and they generally keep on at an easy pace, which is seldom altered into a trot. This is the only means of conveyance for travellers over the greater part of Italy, unless they choose to ride post. This last way is, however, preferable, and not very expensive, if two or three people join to gether. There are good post-chaises to be bought in almost every town of Italy, which, after carrying you all over the country may be sold again at very little loss. The vetturino is but a poor sub stitute for an English stage-coach, or even for a French diligence. These vetturini are to be"], [226, "204 VETTL'RINI. found in every part of Italy ; some of them are possessed of considerable property, having a great number of carriages, which they send all over Italy, and often into France, Germany, Poland, and even Russia. There was a man at Florence, of the name of Pollastro, who did considerable business in this line ; he enjoyed a great reputation for his attention to travellers, the goodness of his coaches, and the superiority of his mules (for such he mostly employed), and the honesty of the drivers who were in his service. Travellers generally bargain with the vetturino to carry them and their baggage to such a place for a certain sum, for which he is to provide them also with their dinner, and bed at night. This makes it very convenient for people of small income, as they are thereby free from any extra expense on the road. A certain expe rience, however, is required, to make a good bargain with the vetturini, as they will ask at first a great deal more than the regular charge. They have no fixed days of departure, but will set off as soon as they have engaged a sufficient number of travellers to defray their expenses, and to afford them a mo derate profit. The common charge of the vetturino for one person, is about half a louis d'or, or ten shillings a day. The distance between Florence and Bologna is about sixty-five Italian miles, and the road is"], [227, "205 APENNINES. entirely mountainous, as it passes over the great ridge of the Apennines. These mountains, which might be called the spinal bone of Soutli Italy, keep all along at a nearly equal distance from the Adriatic and the Mediterranean Seas. The Apen nines give to Italy that variety of climate, produc tions and landscape, for which this country is so remarkable ; so that the traveller departing from any point of the sea-shore may, in one day's journey, find himself transported, as if by enchantment, from sultry plains and sun-burnt fields, into cool verdant groves and cloud-capped summits. These moun tains have a sloping conical shape ; the highest part of them is mostly naked, and bears a dark cheerless aspect ; but some of the valleys at their base are delightful beyond description, and realize all we read of rural beauties in romances and fairy tales. Between Le Maschere and Scaricalasino is the highest part of the mountain, called the Giogo ; and here the road is rather dangerous, aa it hangs over tremendous precipices, without any kind of parapet. The sudden gusts of wind, and the mists which rise frequently in these upper regions, are not apt to quiet the alarms of the unexperienced traveller. At Scaricalasino we left the territory of Tuscany, and entered the Papal States ; our baggage underwent an examination by the custom"], [228, "206 BOLOGNA. house people, and our passports were inspected by the military officer on duty; two tiresome for malities which one must put up with frequently in travelling through Italy, as they occur every time one passes from one state into another, and some times twice in the same day. We descended from the Apennines into the fertile plains of the Bolog nese, which have given to this city the epithet of Bologna la Grassa. This city is situated in a most rich country, watered by numerous rivers which empty themselves into the Po. The principal among them is the Reno, which flows near the walls of Bologna. Industry has well improved those natural advan tages for the purposes of agriculture and com merce. A number of canals have been cut to join the different rivers ; and there are packet boats called corriere, which go regularly from Bologna to Venice and back again, and by which passen gers may proceed in a pleasant and economical manner. They pass from the Reno into the Po, from the Po into the Adige, and from the latter river into the Lagune. Bologna is a considerable city, containing above sixty thousand inhabitants. The streets are narrow and dark, and rendered more so by low arcades with which they are lined on both sides ; these are however convenient to shelter the pedestrian from"], [229, "207 BUILDINGS. the rain in winter, and the heat of the sun in summer, although they certainly do not add to the beauty of the town. There are in the middle of the city two towers remarkable for their great height, the Asinelli and the Garisenda, the latter of which, like the celebrated tower of Pisa, is so constructed as to lean considerably on one side ; but the resemblance ends there, for it cannot boast of the elegance of architecture of the Pisan steeple, being built of brick and without ornaments. Bologna contains several remarkable churches and palaces, which are particularly rich in paintings, by the brothers Caracci, Guercino, and others of the Lombard and Venetian schools. It is perhaps the richest city in Italy in works of art. The principal churches are that of St. Peter, San Petro nio, San Domenico, and i Celestini. The church of La Madonna della Guardia, out of the town, is joined to it by an arcade of nearly three miles in length. The palaces Caprara and Ranuzzi are the most admired for their architecture. The beauti ful fountain in the Piazza del Gigante is the work of the celebrated sculptor Giovanni Bologna. The institution or university of Bologna has pro duced many distinguished characters, especially in experimental philosophy, medicine, and surgery, among whom figure several ladies.

Among the distinguished men of our days are the famous Galvani ; his nephews the two Aldini, one a diplomatist, and the other a celebrated naturalist; the linguist Mezzofanti; the professors Venturoli, and Pozzetti ; several eminent juriscon sults such as Gambari and Magnani, and others. The famous Zambeccari, an intrepid aeronaut, was a native of Bologna. He devoted his life to the improvement of that modern discovery, and was several times in great danger in his aerial excur sions, particularly once, when his balloon was driven into the Adriatic sea, where he was nearly lost. He was rescued from his perilous situation by some fishermen. He at last died in 1812, a victim to his zeal for aeronautic experiments. The Bolognese form a medium between their neighbours the Tuscans and the Lombards or Milanese. They have something of the liveliness and wit of the former, and much of the open good humoured disposition of the latter. Although long subject to the Popes, they always enjoyed consider able privileges, and the name of Libert as still con tinued to appear on their arms and on their coins. A Cardinal Legate sent from Rome acted as go vernor, and that situation was looked upon as one of great trust and importance in the Papal adminis tration. When the French invaded Lombardy in the name of liberty, the Bolognese could not resist"], [231, "political changes. 209 the temptation ; they showed themselves enthusiastic admirers of the new system ; their wishes were at last gratified, and they became citizens of the short-lived Cisalpine Republic. I rather suspect, however, they soon found out their mistake, and began to see through the arts of their pretended liberators ; an epigram that was circulated about that time, after a hail storm which destroyed their harvest, seems to bear witness to the cooling of their senti ments towards the French and their General Bona parte, who is in it profanely but sarcastically alluded to as a second Almighty.

After the republican drama, followed first the consular, and next the imperial and royal systems of government. Bologna followed the fate of the other states of Upper Italy, and became a part of the kingdom of that name under the Viceroy Eugene. It continued so until the unforeseen reverses of the French armies, in 1814, induced Murat, then king of Naples, to think of profiting by his brother-in-law's errors and misfortunes, in securing to himself the friendship of the allies. He moved towards the north of Italy at the head of a fine army, and acted in concert with the Austrians Vol. I.

Murat in his progress occu pied Bologna, where he had his head-quarters for some time during that momentous crisis. His troops fought at Rubiera, near Reggio, between Modena and Parma; and for once in modern history, a Neapolitan army had the advantage, and that, over Eugene's veteran soldiers, the sharers of Napoleon's military fame. The Itahan General Severoli was severely wounded in the action. When at last, after Napoleon's first abdication and Eugene's capitula tion at Mantua, Murat returned to his own domi nions, the Austrians occupied Bologna and the whole country as far as the Rubicon, on the fron tiers of the Marca d' Ancona. Those provinces were provisionally governed by Austrian military commanders, who, it should seem, did not find the means of gaining the affections of the Bolognese ; for, on Murat's second advance into Upper Italy in the spring of 1815, no longer as an ally but as an enemy of Austria, pretending to re-establish the unity and independence of Italy, these magical words had again their wonted effect upon the minds of the Bolognese, who showed with more eagerness than prudence, their zeal for what they looked upon as the common cause of the country.

The city and territory of Bologna, and those of Ferrara and Romagna, are called the three Legazioni, and are now restored to the civil admi nistration of the Pope, their former sovereign. From Bologna we proceeded by another vetturino through Modena, Reggio, Parma, and Piacenza; the country is flat, although the Apennines of Tuscany are seen at no great distance on the left. Each of the four last mentioned cities have had their times of political independence and splendour in the middle ages, when they were ruled by their native princes of the houses of Este and Farnese. At present, Modena and Reggio are governed by the Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, who is married to a princess of Sardinia ; and Parma and Piacenza form the sovereignty which has been bestowed upon the Ex-Empress Maria Louisa, as a compensation for the thrones of France and Italy. I saw but little of those cities, only stopping a short time in each of them. They appeared to me remarkably P 2"], [234, "212 MODENA AND PARMA. dull and gloomy ; although situated in a fertile country, there seems to be but little trade and in dustry. The grass grows in several of the streets of Modena, and even in the square in front of the splendid ducal palace. But how can it be other wise ? Little states encompassed on every side by a line of custom-houses, destitute of capital, of re sources, at a distance from the sea, obliged to pay heavy taxes to maintain a court, an administration, and an army ; their sovereigns under the influence of foreign powers ; such is the condition of these inland sovereignties ; and can it be wondered at if the people do not thrive ? The cathedral of Modena is a singular gloomy Gothic structure : the marble tower is one of the loftiest in Italy. From Modena there is a direct road to Florence across the Apen nines, without passing through Bologna. Parma is a large city, but very thinly inhabited, surrounded by walls and ditches. The river Parma runs through it. Of a great number of rivers which we passed in our journey, all of which empty them selves into the Po, the most considerable is the Taro, which we crossed in a ferry a few miles beyond Parma. This river has its source in the Ligurian Apennines ; and there is a road from Parma which follows its course through the Val di Taro, and then leads across the mountains into the Genoese territories, and to the shores of the Mediterranean."], [235, "213 PIACENZA. It was, I believe, through this road that General Macdonald, now Duke of Tarentum, led his troops, coming from the farthest parts of the kingdom of Naples, to fight against the famous Suwarrow, at the sanguinary battle of La Trebbia, under the walls of Piacenza, in 1799. The great theatre of Parma is one of the largest and best built in Italy. The churches abound with paintings by Correggio and Parmegiano. Piacenza is rather a cheerful looking place, finely situated on the right or southern bank of the Po. Being built on an elevated ground and in an open country, it is seen at some distance ; this is not the case with the other towns of Lombardy, which, being surrounded by gardens and trees, are not perceivable until one arrives at the very gates. Piacenza is a fortified town ; it commands one of the principal passages over the Po. The palace of the ancient dukes is a remarkable building, with a covered gallery running round it ; the brass equestrian statues, in the square before it, of two princes of the Farnese family, are very fine. The Po forms the boundary of the Austrian dominions in Italy. We passed that noble river on a bridge of boats, and after going through the usual inspection of our baggage and passports, proceeded through the Milanese territories. We passed byr Lodi, an apparently populous and bustling town, and arrived"], [236, "214 MILAN at Milan on the fourth day after leaving Bologna. The whole distance is about one hundred and twenty Italian miles. I thought I saw a great improve ment in the appearance of the country and of the inhabitants after crossing the Po, and particularly in approaching Milan. An air of neatness and comfort, cleaner houses, improved looks of the peasants, the roads frequented by people going from one town to the other, wealthy farmers riding in their cabriolets, fields well cultivated, canals cut in every direction for the purpose of irrigation ; all this made an agreeable contrast with the solitude, the heavy looks of the people, and the gloomy towns on the south of the Po. The females, too, were fairer and handsomer than those I had seen in the states of Modena and Parma. As for the language, it is all bad enough : since I left the frontiers of Tuscany I have not heard any Italian spoken. A succession of the most disagreeable dialects, such as the Bolognese, Modenese, Par mesan, and Milanese, all broad and harsh, and differing only from bad to worse, have tormented nr\u00bb* ears. At Milan, the better people speak good talian, but still with a broad accent, of which they se dom can divest themselves.

It is built in the middle of the immense plains of Lombardy, at an equal distance from the Alps and the Po. The rivers Olona and Lario flow by its walls ; besides which, there is the canal called Na viglio, which runs through the town, and which affords a communication with the Ticino and the Adda, and through these with the Po, and with the lakes Maggiore and di Como. This canal is to Milan a great source of commerce and wealth. The ancient city is irregularly built, and is sur rounded on all sides by the Naviglio, beyond which is the modern part of the town, erected in an elegant and splendid style. The whole is surrounded by ramparts, planted with trees, like the Boulevards of Paris, and used as a public walk. Milan is not a fortified city ; it had a citadel, or castle, which was razed in the late wars ; a part of it still exists and has been converted into barracks for soldiers.

Milan is remark able above other Italian cities in general, for an air of wealth, splendour, and luxury ; it is full of bustle and life, participating of foreign taste, elegance, and improvement, which may be ascribed to the long residence of the French, who called it le petit Paris. The population of Milan is above one hundred thousand inhabitants ; it was still more considerable when the Viceroy Eugene resided here. The principal gates, or rather barriers, of Milan, are, the Porta Romana ; the Porta Marengo, which opens into the road to Pavia and Genoa ; the Porta Vercellina, which leads to Vercelli and Turin ; the Porta Sempione, so called on account of the famous military road of that name ; and the Porta Orientale, leading to Bergamo and Brescia. The road leading through the latter gate, called II Corso di Porta Orientale, is much frequented as a walk by the fashionables of Milan on Sunday evenings. Splen did carriages, elegantly dressed pedestrians, all proceed there, to display their finery. Many hand some females, who resort here from every part of Italy for no creditable purposes, mix in the crowd with the citizen's wives and daughters.

Great dissipation, relax ation of morals, and a thirst for pleasure, seem to prevail at Milan, and every facility is given to these propensities. Public licensed gambling-houses are daily opened at Milan, where people may go and ruin themselves with the permission of the police. I went to see the celebrated Theatre of la Scala, one of the finest in Europe, and which rivals San Carlo of Naples. There are besides several other theatres for the Opera Buffa and prose perform ances. The Duomo, or Cathedral, of Milan, is one of the largest in Europe. It stands in the centre of the town, and its spire, which serves as a directing post to strangers, may be seen from almost every part of it ; the exterior of this edifice is one of the most laboured and magnificent efforts of Gothic architecture. It is a mountain of marble, cut, for the most part, into diminutive ornaments, obelisks, columns, and statues, of all sizes. The front has been built at three different times and in three dif ferent styles ; the Roman, the Gothic, and the modern are contrasted together. The interior of the church is grand and imposing, but not much ornamented, and is not kept clean. It is divided into five naves. I ascended to the summit of the church ; it is like a forest of marble, if I may be"], [240, "218 DUOMO OF MILAN. allowed the expression. There are more than a hundred spires, or obelisks, of various dimensions, with a dozen or two of small statues placed in niches round each obelisk, so that a great number of them are lost to the sight. One may imagine what an immense labour and expense ! It is not yet com pleted, however, on one side ; the revenues allotted for the purpose of terminating this monument of bad taste, were seized by the revolutionary govern ment. Napoleon afterwards allotted four millions for the purpose. The stone used for this co lossal building is a kind of white marble, and has been taken from the mountains which surround the Lago Maggiore. There are five hundred and twenty steps to ascend up the dome to a small gallery that runs around the spire, from which I had a most beautiful view of the plain of Lombardy, and of the chain of Alps which border it in a semi circle on the northern side. This panorama is the grandest and most extensive I have seen, and I would recommend to all travellers not to miss it in passing by Milan, for it is well worth the trouble ; it must be seen on a clear morning, a thing not very common in this city.

While I was lost in contemplation, a mist arose, and at once the Alps and the Apennines, Lom bardy and its towns, all vanished, like a mo mentary dream of bliss.

Very few beggars are to be seen in the streets of Milan, a pleasing exception from the rest of Italy. All kinds of provisions are good, cheap, and plentiful ; the plains produce abundance of corn, rice, wine, and vegetables ; the valleys of the Alps afford excellent pasture for cattle ; and meat, milk, butter, and cheese, are superior in this country. It is a matter of astonishment to a stranger how, after such a period of wars and in vasions as that which has just closed, during which myriads of troops have lived at discretion in this devoted country, and enormous contributions have been exacted by foreign rulers, \u2014 how, I say, Lom bardy is still one of the richest counti-ies in Eu rope ; a year or two of tranquillity being sufficient to make up for all those calamities : so bountiful has nature been to this land ! The tables of the Milanese are copiously supplied ; they make, at least, thr?e substantial meals a-day ; they are, therefore, looked upon as gourmands by the more frugal Italians of the south. Minestra, or soup, is not here, as beyond the Apennines, the first dish, and the sine qua non of an Italian dinner; they have a first course composed of entremets, sau sages, fried meat or liver, highly seasoned, to whet"], [243, "221 LITERATURE. the appetite, after which come soup, bouilli, and the more substantial dishes. Their way of dress ing their victuals is also less Italian ; oil is almost discarded, and, instead of it, they use a great deal of butter, which makes me think myself almost out of Italy. Common wine is very bad ; but wines from Brianza, and the hills near the lakes, as well as from Piedmont and other provinces, are very pleasant, wholesome, and reasonable. One of the most favourite dishes with the Milanese is the ri sotto, or rice, made up in a kind of pudding with hashed meat, butter, eggs, and saffron, and highly seasoned. I had formerly heard the Italians of the south call Lombardy, and particularly Milan, the B\u0153otia of Italy ; the appellation was even then unjust, but would be more so now, that this city is become the centre of Italian literature. Lombardy has produced of late many names illustrious in the re public of letters ; and Milan, after it was made the capital of the kingdom of Italy, became the general resort of learning and genius. Cesarotti, Monti, Parini, Gianni, and other modern Italian poets, made it their principal residence. More books are published at Milan than in all the rest of Italy ; and several periodical publications on scientific, classical, and literary subjects, superior to any thing of the same sort formerly known"], [244, "222 CIRCO on the south of the Alps, are now printed at Milan, Padua, and Pavia. I went to the uni versity and academy at Brera, where I visited the Pinacoteca, or museum of the fine arts ; there are many paintings by Guido, Titian, Andre del Sarto, Leonardo da Vinci, the Caracci, Veronese, Ru bens, Vandyck, fye, A Raphael in his early style, representing the marriage of the Virgin Mary, shows how inferior are those early specimens of that great master's powers to his subsequent works, particularly in softness and delicacy. In the sculp ture room there are a great number of casts, but few statues. The library is a fine one, divided into several rooms; I was shewn editions of Ho race;; Dante, and others, of the first era of typo graphy. The Circo, or amphitheatre, which stands on one side of the Piazza d' arme, or reviewing ground, is a modern building erected during the French dominion, in imitation of the Roman am phitheatres, and intended for the display of public games, such as chariot races, and bull fights. It is of an oval form ; the arena is about one hundred and twenty French toises in length ; on one side is the pulvinare, or covered gallery, magnificently ornamented with painted stuccoes, and where the sovereign and his court take their station to see the games. The arena is so constructed, as to be filled"], [245, "PUBLIC WALKS. 223 occasionally with water, and to be transformed into a naumachia for rowing-matches. Under the French government, the amphitheatre, on remarkable oc casions, was opened to the public gratis ; in this way they contrived to lull the people asleep, by affording them amusements and dissipation, much in the same manner that the Roman emperors gave fights of gladiators, to captivate the affection of the populace, and make them lose sight of their oppressive sway. At the farthest end of the Piazza d' arme, is the triumphal arch intended for Bonaparte, but which has not been finished ; the bassi relievi, representing his victories, are huddled together under temporary barracks, and the whole arch is surrounded by a wooden shed. One of the finest walks of Milan is the Foro, in the neighbourhood of the Piazza d' arme ; it is planted with trees, which afford a pleasant shade. Near the Porta Orientale there is a fine palace with gardens, formerly called Villa Bonaparte, and now the residence of the Austrian governor. By degrees the obnoxious names are dropped, and every thing modelled to the taste of the present rulers. The Basilica Ambrosiana, dedicated to Sans Ambrogio, Bishop of Milan, is a very ancient and extensive building, situated in a romantic, solitary part of the city. One of the peculiar charms of Italy is, in my opinion, that every part of it con-"], [246, "224 HOSPITAL. tains monuments and buildings, which waft our imagination to times and circumstances of un common interest, \u2014 to remote ages, of which we can form but an imperfect and obscure idea ; our cu riosity is interested, and solemn reflections ensue. The name of Ambrose, that undaunted defender of the orthodox church, carries the mind back to the times when Milan was the capital of the western empire, when emperors and C\u00e6sars kept their court in that city, and thence ruled civilized Europe. The library, attached to the Basilica, is rich in manu scripts ; many of which, together with several pa pirii, were taken away by the French. One of the most interesting buildings in Milan is the great hospital. It is a long parallelogram of con siderable extent, situated close to the canal Naviglio. It has the disadvantage of being too much in the centre of the city, an inconvenience common to many ancient institutions of the same kind, formed in times when the knowledge of medicine was still in its infancy. In the middle of it is a spacious court surrounded by porticoes, under which, on certain days of the year, are exposed the portraits of the numerous benefactors who have contributed by liberal legacies to the support of this charitable foundation. A singular but harmless distinction is made in these paintings. Those patrons who have contributed below a certain sum, are repre-"], [247, "225 HOSPITAL. sented standing ; those whose benefactions have been more considerable are painted sitting com fortably at their ease. It is a pleasant sight to behold these testimonies of gratitude to those phi lanthropic minds who have honoured their age and their country. Every town in Italy had similar institutions, but their revenues suffered much dur ing the revolution. The reformers of that epoch, wholly intent on enlightening the minds of their fellow-creatures, and expelling from them the dark ness of ignorance, its prejudices and superstitions, did sometimes forget that men, even when so spiri tualized, are still encumbered with a body; that they are apt to fall sick ; that they are subject to grief and misfortunes; that sometimes they are likely to wish for a quiet retreat to meditate and study ; and that, therefore, hospitals, churches, and even a few convents, are very useful institutions in their proper place. In those dark ages which we are so apt to look upon with a kind of horror, many a benevolent man thought of alleviating the bodily sufferings of his fellow-creatures; there is then some good to be derived even from the example of our ancestors. Every age, as well as every nation, has its peculiar vices and follies ; good is always to be found by the side of evil, and I believe Provi dence has balanced both with the most benevolent views towards man. Vol. I. Q"], [248, "226 LA ZECCA. La Zecca, or the mint of Milan, is a remarkable building. Its distribution, the excellence of the engines employed in the process of coining, the number of workmen, and the regularity of all the parts of its administration, are admirable. It owes these advantages to the French government, which generally carried these national institutions to a great degree of perfection and splendour. To those who knew Milan during the late king dom of Italy, it is easy to conceive that the Milanese were attached to it, and have regretted its fall. They are in this respect differently situated from any other people in Italy. Under Napoleon and his Viceroy Eugene, Milan became the capital of a considerable state, a second Paris, the residence of a brilliant court, the centre of arts and sciences: the city was embellished, and adorned with walks and buildings; the vanity, the ambition, and the interest of its inhabitants were flattered. Milan was the place of resort for people from all parts of Upper Italy, to sue for situations, promotions, honours, and pensions. Nor did the advantage rest here. The Milanese thought of their city be coming one day the capital of the whole of Italy. Although placed under the paramount influence of France, they fondly and credulously hoped, that at the death of Napoleon, the kingdom of Italy would become independent under the sway of a"], [249, "227 DISPOSITION OF THE MILANESE. separate dynasty, and that all the brilliant dreams cherished by Italian minds for centuries past> would then become realized. All this glorious vision has vanished ; the gay structure has fallen to the ground, and Milan has returned to the con dition of a provincial city, under foreign rulers, whose manners, language, and ideas are less con genial to the inhabitants than those of the French ; and the Milanese have no prospect of seeing their fate altered. Can they feel satisfied? The other great cities of Italy, Turin, Florence, Rome, and Naples, have each a court ; they behold their ancient sove reigns, Italian sovereigns, residing amongst them. Milan has none of these advantages, for the re tinue of the archduke is not to be compared to a kingly court. The Milanese have been, therefore, looked upon, and with foundation, as being gene rally partial (with the exception of some of the nobility and clergy) to the French system. But they are a quiet, sensible race of men, and they seem thoroughly persuaded that any attempt to change their present condition would only make it worse ; so they sit down contented, \u2014 eat, drink, and submit to their destiny. They are not by nature either revolutionists or conspirators, although they talk freely ; indeed, Milan has always, during the late wars, quietly submitted to the conqueror of the day. The only instance in which the Q2"], [250, "228 MURDER OF COUNT PRINA. people of Milan have shewn a mutinous and vin dictive spirit, was in the murder of Prina, the minister of finances under Eugene. That ill-fated man was a Piedmontese by birth, and he had ren dered himself obnoxious, in the time of his power, by acts of severity and oppression. When the Austrians approached Milan, in 1814, the people began to shew symptoms of restlessness. Some in dividuals belonging to government, who had reason to believe themselves obnoxious, seeing the storm gathering, thought it prudent to conceal themselves, until the Austrian army should enter and overawe the populace ; as few, or none of the Italian troops had remained in the capital, but had retired to Man tua, with the Viceroy Eugene. Prina was advised to take similar precautions ; but he affected to think too slightly of the Milanese, and remained quietly in his palace. At last, the multitude, urged, it is said, by some intriguing characters, who had further views of their own, assembled in front of Prina's house, threatening vengeance on the devoted minister. Prina then thought of escaping, but it was too late. The incensed populace rushed into his sumptuous apartments, destroying every thing in the house, and throwing the furniture out of the windows ; they did not, however, offer any personal violence to any of its inhabitants, but looked into every re cess for Prina, whom alone they wanted. They"], [251, "229 MURDER OF COUNT PRINA. sound him at last concealed in a garret, half un- dressed, and then the work of vengeance began. '1 he wretched victim was made to feel all kinds of abuses and humiliation ; and he, who a few days before saw the whole of Milan trembling at his feet, who disposed of the properties and liberties of its citizens, was now at the mercy of the meanest of the rabble. They dragged him through the streets. General Pino came forward to harangue the multitude, and to persuade them to give Prina up to the proper authorities, but to no purpose ; and the General himself was warned to retire. The mob increased, but in the confusion Prina contrived to escape, only to feel the bitterness of death protracted. He took shelter in a shop ; thence he passed into an adjoining house; but the people, who were resolved on his destruction, had already surrounded every avenue. They found him out a second time, as he was disguising himself in a priest's dre'ss, and then \" mercy sighed farewell !\" They beat him, threw him down, dragged him by his feet along the pavement, upbraiding him with abuses and reproaches, and striking him with the ferrules of their umbrellas, as several well dressed persons were seen taking part in the dreadful butch- ery. Night added to the horror of the scene ; at last, one more violent, or more merciful than the rest, gave him a final blow on the head with a club,"], [252, "230 MURAT's SECOND CAMPAIGN IN 1815. and thereby terminated his sufferings. Such was the end of Prina, a terrible instance of popular re venge ! His house was entirely demolished on the same day. I have seen the place where once it stood. Throughout the whole transaction, revenge, and not pillage, was the object ; and the people ac complished their purpose with the most astonishing coolness and perseverance. i When Murat advanced to the Po in 1815, in viting all Italians to take up arms for the inde pendence of Italy, the Milanese remained quiet, as if they had foreseen the end of that rash expedition. When Murai's pompous proclamation, dated from Rimini, arrived at Milan, General Bellegarde, the Austrian governor, published immediately a well written answer in refutation of it ; and the two printed manifestoes were circulated together through the city, that people might compare their contents. I happened to be at Milan at the time, and heard the remarks made by the natives, who appeared to be quite tired of changes. There were then very few Austrian troops in the capital ; still the theatres and public places continued open and frequented as usual, and the general tranquillity was not in the least disturbed, although, from Milan, people might almost hear the firing of the cannon of the Neapo litan army on the banks of the Po. The country around Milan is flat and mono-"], [253, "231 ENVIRONS OF MILAN. tonous, but well cultivated ; some parts of it are un healthy, on account of the risiere, or rice-fields, which require to be inundated. The nobility and men of wealth have their country-houses many miles distant from the town, on the hills of Varese and Brianza, or on the delightful shores of the lake Maggiore, and of the lake of Como. Monza, a few miles from Milan, was the favourite residence of the Viceroy Eugene ; it has a noble palace with fine gardens annexed to it. The atmosphere of Milan is thick and misty, but not unwholesome; it suits particularly people affected by pectoral or pulmonic complaints, who are frequently sent from Genoa and other maritime places, to try the air of Milan. Milan being in a low situation, in the middle of an immense plain, the climate is very hot in summer; and as, at the same time, it is too far from the Alps to be sheltered by them, the cold northerly winds blowing over the glaciers of Switzerland are felt at times severely in winter. Upon the whole, it is an agreeable place to spend a few weeks in; but it has not, like the more southern Italian cities, lasting attractions for a foreigner. It is, at the same time, a modern city, and has not the spell of classical monuments to re commend it. I left Milan by the usual conveyance of a vettu rino, to proceed to Switzerland over the Simplon."], [254, "232 STRADA SEMPIONE. Tliis famous road was constructed by Bonaparte's orders, in order that he might have at all times a free access for his armies into the very heart of Italy, and be able thereby to say, il ny a plus d'Alpes, as Lewis XIV. said, il riy a plus de Pyrenees. It is certainly the grandest work of the kind effected by Napoleon, who employed in its construction many millions, the labour of several thousands of people, and seven or eight years of time. That part of the road which crosses the great chain of Alps that divides Italy from Switzerland, is equal to the greatest works of the ancient Romans. We travelled the first day's journey along the dusty roads of the Milanese territory. The country is fertile, the fields are planted with corn, and crossed at equal distances by rows of vines and mulberry-trees. The latter is a very important produce, as silk forms one of the principal revenues of Lombardy. Travelling through this country is very dull ; the long straight avenues of trees which line the road, afford no prospect ; few country houses are seen ; and I was glad when we ap proached the lovely hills that border the Lago Maggiore. We arrived in the afternoon at Sesto, a small town, built at the place where the Tesino comes out of the lake; there we had a beautiful view of the St. Gothard and its adjoining moun-"], [255, "233 VALLI DI NOVARA. tains, all covered with snow : we crossed the river, and entered the territories of the King of Sardinia. This province is called il Novarese, from Novara, its capital ; it chiefly consists of a number of valleys branching in different directions between the Alps, some as far as the foot of Mount Rosa, and others towards the Furca mountains. It is a land rich in pastures, and it participates of the nature of the Swiss and of the Italian countries. It has all the bold romantic scenery of the former, while it enjoys the genial sun and milder sky of the latter. The whole of this remote part of Italy, between the lakes and the Alps, is a most delightful region. We slept that night at Arona, a neat little town, very prettily situated on the lake. I saw many boats and small vessels before it, as a considerable trade is carried on with the opposite Milanese coast, and the remoter one of the Swiss Canton of Tesino. On a hill above Arona stands a brass colossal statue of St. Charles Borromeo, the benevolent and philan thropic bishop of Milan ; it is sixty Milanese braccia in height, including the pedestal, and it is seen at a great distance. Near it is a college founded by the holy prelate. From Arona to Baveno, we followed a fine level road along the shores of the lake ; this beau t if ul mass of waters, of an irregular shape, above fifty miles in length, varying from four to eight"], [256, "234 LAGO MAGGIORE. in its breadth, is enclosed by hills covered with all the produce of Italian vegetation, full of villages and cottages, while it stretches its northern ex- tremity to the very foot of the Rh\u00e6tian Alps. The scenery is fine beyond description. At Baveno we took a boat and went to see the celebrated Borro- mean islands, belonging to the Milanese family of that name. The Isola Bella, where we landed, is certainly deserving this name. Its gardens rise upon terraces one above the other in gay succes- sion; in the middle of them stands the splendid palace of the owners ; the apartments are richly and elegantly decorated ; those of the ground floor have their walls incrusted with a curious kind of mosaic, made of rough pebbles and shells of various colours. The gardens, however, are laid out in the old unnatural style of geometrical compartments and ornaments, which form a most striking con- trast with the wild natural beauties of the op- posite shores. There is a fine grove with giuochi cVacqua. I saw a very fine laurel tree, upon the trunk of which, Bonaparte, in one of his first cam- paigns in Italy, cut the word battaglia ; some of the letters are still to be traced out. While look ing from the terrace in front of the palace over the whole island ; the wide lake around, and the amphi theatre of hills and mountains beyond ; \u2014 here near the shores the calm reflection of woods and white"], [257, "ISOLE BORROMEE. 235 walled cottages in the peaceful waters ; farther on, the towering summits of the Alps, with \" their ten thousand years of snow f \u2014 the stillness of the scene, the singular beauty of this sequestered spot, every thing carried the imagination to the en chanted gardens of Armida ; while the heart owned with a sigh, that nature is ever beautiful, though man is often wretched. I left with regret the Isola Bella, and returned to Baveno. The other two Borromean islands are called Isola Madre, and Isola de Pescatori ; but they are scarcely noticed on account of the superior charms of their fair neighbour. At a short dis tance from Baveno, we left the Lago Maggiore, and turned to the left into deep valleys, follow ing the course of the Toccia or Tosa, a considerable river which rises in the Alps and empties itself into the lake. Here we exchanged the Italian for the true Alpine landscape. Black rocks overhanging the narrow valley, the foaming river below, fir trees covering the sides of the mountains, wooden ham lets scattered here and there, the distant noise of water-falls, and the tinkling of the cow-bell ; such are the characteristics of the Alps. We slept the second night at Domo d' Ossola, a considerable town, tolerably well built, and finely situated in a valley, surrounded on all sides by mountains : next morning we left it, to enter the dark glens of the"], [258, "236 FRONTIERS OF ITALY. Val di Vedro, the gloomiest defiles I have seen. We passed the Tosa at Crevola, on a fine stone bridge, one of the many on this road : there is a considerable glass manufactory near this place. These valleys offer the most suitable spots for such establishments. Abundance of wood and water, a fine road, the convenience of the neighbouring lake, and of the canals communicating from it to the Po ; all these are strong encouragements to industry. From Crevola to this place we have been continually ascending; the scene becoming still wilder and gloomier. Isella, where we dined, is the custom house of the Sardinian states on this side ; the frontier of Switzerland is at Gondo, a little further on. The inn of Isella is built against the rock. A foaming torrent dashes itself at the bottom of the precipice several hundred feet deep; the noise is almost deafening, and the air is loaded with vapours incessantly rising from the abyss below. At the end of the last chapter I left my readers at the foot of the Apennines, in the smiling plains of Italy. The cheerful songs of the vintage were then resounding on all sides ; a brillant sun was vivifying all nature, and calling every faculty of the soul and every sense of the body into action. I conclude this in a humble village, situated in a narrow valley en closed by mountains coeval with the world, and which thrust their granite peaks here and there through"], [259, "237 FRONTIERS OF ITALY. lakes of never melting ice ; the only music here is the deafening noise of the Alpine streams ; the sky is cloudy and gloomy ; a cold drizzling rain pours down incessantly and keeps travellers confined in a dark room of the inn, where they are sometimes obliged to pass whole days waiting for better weather to cross the Alps. Eggs, cheese, and some fish from the river, with sour wine, composed our dinner ; it is more than one would expect in these wilds. This mountain is about six thousand feet in height above the Lago Maggiore, which is seven hundred feet above the level of the Mediterranean sea. These are the frontiers of Italy ; how easily they might be guarded by a brave and patriotic race * ! * The following apostrophe, and the subsequent reflections, which the sight of another part of the bold and craggy ram parts of Italy drew from the eloquent author of the Lettere di Ortis, are very appropriate to the scenery I have been describing : \"I tuoi, confini o Italia, son questi ; ma sono tutto di sor moiitati da ogni parte dalla pertinace avarizia delle nazioni.

HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE NORTH OP ITALY UNDER THE FRENCH. Several governments existed successively in Lombardy after the French invasion of that country in 1796,'namely, the Cisalpine and Italian republics, and the kingdom of Italy. Their aggregate dura tion was only eighteen years ; and they acted a su bordinate, but yet important, part in the eventful history of those times. At the epoch of the French revolution Italy was divided into two monarchies, Naples and Sardinia ; one theocracy, Rome; three oligarchic common wealths, Venice, Genoa, and Lucca ; the Grand Duchy of Tuscany ; the Duchies of Parma and Modena ; and the States of Milan and Mantua, be longing to the Emperor of Austria. These States were ruled with various sway. The institutions in general were strongly aristocratic, but tempered, in some of the states, by the wisdom and liberality of the rulers. The kingdom of the two Sicilies was under one"], [262, "240 OLD ITALIAN GOVERNMENTS. of the most imperfect among the Italian govern- ments. A want of uniformity and regularity pre- vailed in the administration and in the judicature. The laws of the Lombards, Normans, Angevins, Aragonese, Spaniards, and Austrians, who had successively ruled the country, formed a chaos of authorities inconsistent among themselves and often contradictory ; they left to the courts and to the lawyers a quantity of flaws and subterfuges, to elude justice and protract suits from generation to genera- tion. There were no fixed financial views and there- fore no security or stability in the revenue, either public or private. The Barons had lost their feudal rights, especially those which interfered with the power of the crown ; yet retained particularly in Sicily, a few of an inferior nature, but vexatious to the people of the country ; a number of municipal and territorial privileges, and ecclesiastic immu nities, increased the confusion. The court was careless, and given to pleasure ; foreign favourites engrossed the power of the state ; the people indo lent and thoughtless, did not feel the disadvantages of their situation to which they were accustomed, and which, upon the whole, had improved since the establishment of a resident dynasty at Naples : every thing went on, if not rightly, at least smooth ly ; power was mildly enforced, and without acts of flagrant injustice."], [263, "241 OLD ITALIAN GOVERNMENTS. In the Sardinian States, the court and admini stration were more regular, exemplary, and watch ful ; the people more steady and better, though most absolutely ruled ; innovations were avoided, and the laws of Piedmont were what are considered gothic in our days. The oligarchy of Venice had become decrepit ; it had lost its ancient external power, and had relaxed its interior strictness. Its political inquisition was but a fearful shadow. Still the people continued to submit, although they did no longer fear, nor respect their government. In Genoa the aristocracy was less exclusive, and a door was left open to wealth, and to industry, which had been the foundation of its prosperity. Rome was an anomaly in the modern political system of Europe. As long as the Vatican had been, like the ancient Capitol, the centre of power, the source of grace, the dispenser of protection ; \u2014 as long as Rome had attracted the wealth of the world, and received the homage of Sovereigns ; \u2014 this State had retained a disproportioned,but not the less substantial, wealth and splendour. But after the emancipation of most monarchies from the in fluence of the Papal Court, Rome had become a State of little consequence in Europe, and the sources of wealth and credit were drained. Then the want of intrinsic resources was felt. The Vol. I. R"], [264, "242 OLD ITALIAN GOVERNMENTS. elective and therefore unstable Government of Rome had not in itself the power to encourage' in dustry and commerce; it was still too much en grossed with its apparent supremacy over the Ca tholic world, to pay due attention to the wants of its immediate subjects. During the eighteenth cen tury, several truly estimable pontiffs, Benedict XIV., Clement XIII., and the illustrious Ganganelli, had filled in succession the Papal Chair; and, by their virtues and high qualities, had contributed to secure to the Papal See a demonstration of respect from other Governments, which was no longer the result of fear or superstition, but a willing homage paid to the first Prelate, and the acknowledged Head, of the Catholic Church. Pius VI., who sat on the throne of Rome at the epoch of the French revolution, was an amiable and generous man, fond of splendour, a patron of the arts ; but he forgot that he had not at his command the same means as Leo X. He undertook too much and did not therefore succeed. He was besides too partial to his relatives, and had a great share of that unfor tunate spirit of Nepotism, an inherent vice of the theocratical Government. Upon the whole, Rome and Naples might be considered as the worst administered countries in Italy. Of Tuscany, under Leopold and his successor"], [265, "243 AUSTRIAN GOVERNMENT IN LOMBARDY.

Ercole d'Este, Duke of Modena, was a good, equitable, and well-informed prince, and he was liked in his little state. The Duke of Parma, although educated by Condillac, and other philosophers, did not imitate the example of his neighbour of Modena; he was a weak prince, who did not take sufficient care of the welfare of his people. The States of Milan and Mantua had been greatly benefited under the reign of the Empress Maria Theresa, and the administration of the great minister Kaunitz, and of Count Firmian, Austrian governor of Lombardy. Under the Austrian rule, Milan had been embellished, and many sumptuous build ings raised. The Austrian Government established schools, patronised the university of Pavia, and erected the Museum of Brera ; founded a patriotic society for the encouragement of agriculture, arts, and manufactures; reformed the abuses of the system of farming the duties ; made out a cadastro or equitable plan for the land tax ; and protected enlightened and virtuous men, like Pietro Verri, Carli, Parini, and others. Maria Theresa also in tended to establish a resident Court at Milan. All these were benefits of the Austrian administration, which attached the Milanese to the House of R 2"], [266, "244 1792 \u2014 BEGINNING OF THE WAR. Austria. Joseph II. manifested good intentions but not sufficient judgment; he went on rashly with the work of reform, attacked imprudently the clergy and the nobility, and alienated in this manner part of the people, preparing in some de gree the calamities that followed after his death. Such was the state of Italy at the French inva sion ; \u2014 a state of society with many vices, though not of a heinous nature, and in which the rulers were generally mild and paternal, and the ruled satisfied and happy. There was not a field for vast indi vidual speculations ; but there was competence, se curity, and tranquillity. Italy was infinitely hap pier in the latter part of the eighteenth century than it had been for ages before. Charitable insti tutions, public buildings, colleges, roads, walks, theatres, were every where erected and encou raged by the Governments. We will now follow the course of events. The revolution of France excited the alarm and the hostility of all Monarchies, and among the rest, of the Italian Governments. The King of Sardinia, nearly allied to Louis XVI., and most exposed to danger by his proximity to France, could not remain long an unconcerned spectator of the events of the latter country. He was the first to show his disapprobation of them, and was con sequently the first attacked. In 1792, the French"], [267, "179G BONAPARTE INVADES ITALY. 245 invaded Savoy and Nice. The Genoese aristocracy, wishing to remove the danger from themselves, and to save the sums they had lent to France, and miscalculating, as well as most other Governments, the nature of the storm that was approaching, de clared themselves neutral, \u2014 a neutrality which they had not the means of enforcing, and which, there fore, it was easy to foresee would not be long re spected. In fact, the western Riviera became the theatre of war ; and, through the states of Genoa, the French penetrated into Italy, while Genoese merchants supplied their army with provisions. The years 1793, 94, and 95, were passed in various and desultory combats between the French repub licans, and the Piedmontese troops, united to an Austrian corps, which was not so strong as circum stances would have required. But the various Governments could not forget their petty jealousies; they followed their old policy, while their common enemy had adopted a totally new one. At last a young general, only twenty-six years of age, an Italian by birth and by name, arrived at Nice in March 1796, to take the command of the French army called of Italy. In the following month of April, the battles of Montenotte, and Millesimo, opened to him the passes of the Alps, and the en trance into the valleys of Piedmont. With the ra pidity of lightning he surprised the Allies, separated the Austrians from the Piedmontese, defeated the"], [268, "246 THE FRENCH ENTER MILAN. latter at Ceva ind Mondovi, frightened the court of Turin into an armistice, and marched direct upon Milan. The battles of Lodi, and Pizzighet tone, and the entrance of the French into the capital of Lombardy, took place in May. The French army, thus established in the very heart of North Italy, spread themselves all over that country. They invaded the Modenese, Papal, and Tuscan States ; besieged Mantua ; and, in the pur suit of the Austrians, entered Verona and Brescia ; and thus the neutrality of the Venetian Republic was also compromised. But, in the midst of the general alarm, confu sion, and distress, \u2014 whilst two foreign hostile armies were disputing, foot by foot, the fair fields of Italy, which, properly, did not belong to either, \u2014 what were the feelings of the Italians at that period ? Astonishment and dismay seized the dif ferent Italian courts and aristocracies; fanaticism and the ancient hatred of French invasion, were awak ened in the peasantry, and, in some instances, were fomented by the clergy, naturally averse to foreign invaders, who had abolished religion and persecuted its ministers in their own country, and who threat ened to do the same wherever they went. The partial opposition of the inhabitants against the French military had no other effect than that of causing greater evils. Insurrections broke out at Milan, Pavia, Verona, Binasco, and Lugo. The"], [269, "POLITICAL OPINIONS OF THE ITALIANS. 247 French commanders soon conquered them, and took the most severe, and perhaps, in their situation, inevitable, measures, to prevent a recurrence of them. Binasco and Lugo were pillaged and burnt, and part of the inhabitants put to the sword. At Pavia a number of persons were shot, and otherswere sent into France as hostages. Meantime Italy was given up to all the miseries of a conquered country ; and at the discretion of an army which was not checked in its depredations either by discipline, or by any respect for religion. But who were the partisans of the French in Italy ? They were among the middling classes, which in Italy, however, were not, by far, so nu merous in proportion to the rest, as they are in some other countries of Europe, and therefore did not constitute so influential nor so important a body as that which is understood in England by the same appellation. The revolution in Italy did not break out, as in France, by a spontaneous movement of a great mass of people, clamorous and discontented ; it was not inevitable, nor was it called for. It was intro duced into Italy by French bayonets, and after a struggle of several years; the majority of the people were evidently against it; and even when it triumphed, it did not alter the face of things, the forms of society, or the minds of the people, as it"], [270, "248 PARTISANS OF THE REVOLUTION. had done in France. Italy was never completely revolutionized. Some will say this was on account of the bigotry and ignorance of the people ; but, were the lower classes in Italy more bigoted and ignorant than those of France ? Is it not more just to explain this from the difference of national cha racter ? The Italians join, to a great quickness of imagination, much more coolness of judgment, than the French ; and while they have the outward ap pearance of exaltation, they see much deeper into the substance of things, and into the views of others. It was among the lawyers, physicians, artists, and men of letters, that democratic ideas imbibed from the French writings which preceded the revo lution, had taken effect. The hope of participating in the honours and emoluments of a new govern ment, had no small share, as it may be naturally imagined, with many of them. There were but few Italians of sense, however, who imagined it possible to establish a republic in modern Italy; they, probably, looked upon the passing crisis as an unavoidable trial by which Italy would break en tirely its loosened fetters, and resume its proper state among nations. But the inferior instruments were really deceived by the words liberty and republic, to which many of them annexed the idea of license, and they were necessary to the effecting of the change. The impulse being thus given, and sup-"], [271, "249 REPUBBLICA CISPADANA. ported by the presence of the French, discontented men of other classes, from the ranks of the nobility and clergy, joined the democratic party. But the great body of the two latter castes, as well as the peasantry, remained averse to the change. The town of Reggio, in the State of Modena, was the first to give the signal of independence. This happened on the 30th of August, 1796. Modena, Bologna, and Ferrara, imitated the ex ample ; and, on the following month of September, these cities constituted themselves into a federative republic, under the name of Repubblica Cispadana. French commissioners superintended the legislative labours of the new States ; and, on the 4th of De cember, of the same year, the constitution of the Repubblica Cispadana was proclaimed and accepted in the church of S. Petronio of Bologna, under the surveillance of a French aid-de-camp, and a body of French soldiers. About the same time the Repub blica Transpadana was, by similar means, formed at Milan, under a sort of municipal government pro tempore. The river Po was the boundary between these new States. Meantime General Bonaparte pursued his ad vantages ; and, in the early part of 1797, the Aus trians were driven across the Duchy of Trento into the State of Tyrol, and their other German terri tories. They made new efforts to relieve Mantua,"], [272, "250 CAMPAIGN OF 1797. but lost successively the battles of Castiglione, Ri voli, La Favorita, La Piave, and Tagliamento. The French entered Carinthia and Carniola, took Gradiska, Goritz, Leibach, and Clagenfurth. The theatre of war was removed from Italy to the hereditary States of Austria. Bonaparte was but thirty leagues from Vienna, when the imperial court, dismayed by the reverses of its armies, entered into an armistice, which was signed at Leoben. At the same time a petty warfare continued in Italy between the French and some of the native princes ; who, however, found, to their cost, that the moment was past of effectually resisting the French, after Austria, which was the main prop of the confederacy, had been obliged to withdraw her armies and evacuate Italy. The important fortress of Mantua, after a long resistance, had capitulated in February 1797. The Pope, who had neither the power of resisting the French, nor dissimulation enough to become their friend, at least, in appear ance, saw the French troops advance through his territories, and take Ancona and Loreto. He, at last, agreed to a disastrous peace, by the treaty of Tolentino, in February 1797. The King of Sardinia, surrounded in his own capital by French troops, became also their forced and unwilling ally. The Duke of Parma was glad to make peace with the French, at the intercession"], [273, "251 WAR WITH VENICE of his relatives of the dynasty of Spain, and by paying the former several millions. The Duke of Modena had already escaped from his own territory. The Grand Duke of Tuscany remained an un decided spectator, and was obliged to admit a French garrison into Leghorn. The King of Na ples, who, from his situation, had never taken a very active part in the Italian coalition, except by sending some detachments of troops to the Austrian army, had already made his peace upon better terms; his day of reckoning had not yet come. The republic of Venice had shown itself vacillat ing in its policy ; those who judged of passing events unconditionally, said that the Venetian senate had wofully degenerated from its ancient wisdom ; but would it not have been also just to say that every thing had changed around them, and that even the Dandolos, the Foscaris, and the Loredanos could not have averted the storm, had they lived in 1797 ? There was an ill-concealed and very natural hatred in the patricians of Venice against the French, which the latter were not sorry in perceiving, as they knew it would furnish them a pretence for extending their conquests. Accordingly, in consequence of some revolts which took place in the Venetian States against the French, General Bonaparte declared war against the republic in the beginning of May, 1797. The French invaded the whole of its continental"], [274, "252 FALL OF VENICE. territories, yet the city of Venice might have made a bold resistance ; its riches and its fleet would have supplied the means of subsistence and defence, but it was then that the spirit of the senate showed itself really fallen. While their mercenary soldiers, the Sclavonians, were prepared and endeavouring to defend them against their own pusillanimity, the Senate and the Doge assembled in council, and allowed themselves to be frightened by the audacity of one of their subjects, a man of the name of Zorzi, a merchant druggist, who came to beard them in their own hall, demanding of them to resign their authority, threatening to have the palace sur rounded by thousands of republicans, which threat, however, he would not have been able to realize, had the others stood firm. This bravado had its effect. The senate resigned, a democratical government was established, and the French troops were admitted into Venice, which, since its foundation, for more than a thousand years, had not witnessed a foreign con queror within its walls. Thus ended that ancient state, which had once astonished the world ; now hardly any one regretted its fall . Meantime Bonaparte, having terminated his brilliant campaign, after performing his duties as a French general, having obtained the undisturbed sway of Upper Italy, and secured his army from every danger of reverse or surprise, began to"], [275, "253 ANARCHY IN ITALY. bestow his attention on the internal state of that country, which was, as it might be imagined, in a most deplorable state of confusion. The French generals and commissaries were exacting enormous contributions, spoliating palaces and churches, and the soldiers were not much restrained in their licen tiousness, especially towards women, nor in their contumelies towards the established form of worship. In the first epoch of popular effervescence, many excesses were committed by the Italian democrats. Persons were arrested, properties sequestrated, vexations and insults heaped upon every supposed aristocrat ; to the great honour, however, of the Italian character, they did not, even at that critical moment, imitate the French revolutionists in the effusion of blood. The blood that was shed was between the French and the insurgent peasantry ; and in this warfare little mercy was shown by either party. But at the same time all establish ments, whether civil, political or religious, were overthrown ; the national worship and its ministers, the institutions most venerated by the people, were ridiculed and caricatured on the stage; impious and obscene writings and speeches circulated and applauded; social order was at an end. Most of the people, amazed, looked on without taking any part in the work of frenzy. Property had become insecure, and moderate citizens were obliged"], [276, "254 REPUBBLICA CISALPINA. to dissemble their sentiments, and to appear to co-operate with the violent demagogues. But the very men, who, for a short time, ruled and tormented their country, found themselves at last entangled in a labyrinth, out of which they could not find any issue. When the intoxication had somewhat subsided, they saw the necessity of wiser and more enlarged measures, to which they, how ever, felt themselves inadequate. Their allies the French were resorted to. As a preliminary step, Bonaparte united the two ephemeral republics Cispadana and Transpadana, and created a central provisional government at Milan. This was in May 1797, and in the fol lowing month of June, the Cisalpine republic was proclaimed. It consisted of Austrian Lombardy, of the Venetian provinces of Brescia and Ber gamo, of the Papal States of Bologna, Ferrara, and Romagna, and of the provinces of Val tellina, Massa, and Carrara. The constitution was modelled upon the one then existing in France ; a representative and legislative council, a house of Seniori, and a directory or executive government. Bonaparte chose the members of the directory, and designated the ministers of the new republic. The French general having accomplished this, signed in the same year the famous treaty of peace"], [277, "255 PEACE OF CAMPO FORMIO. of Campoformio with Austria, by which Venice and the greater part of its territory were given to the Emperor, in compensation for the Netherlands which were united to France. This was the first open act of French policy which alienated the Italians of all parties. It was unjust and cruel to wards the Venetians; although, perhaps, it was expedient to France. In December of the same year General Bonaparte returned to Paris. During 1798, the Cisalpine re-' public dragged on its tottering existence, which de pended upon the fiat of the French directory, whose unprincipled policy was then already notorious. The constitution was changed by orders from France ; the inviolability of the representatives of the nation was broken ; and all sorts of humiliations were heaped upon Italy by the ambassadors from the directory, by their generals who still treated it as a conquered country, and by the misunderstand ings and incapacity of those at the head of affairs, some of whom had good intentions, but were unable to remedy the enormous evils of their country. In this year, however, 1798, the French armies in Italy continued to be successful, although their favourite leader was far away, fighting on the sands of Egypt and Syria. In consequence of provo cations given by the governments of Rome and Naples, and eagerly treasured up by the French"], [278, "256 CAMPAIGN OF 1799. directory, the French invaded the South of Italy, and established two other ephemeral republics, the Roman, in February 1798 ; and the Parthenopean or Neapolitan, in January 1799. The republic of Genoa had already changed its old government in June 1797, for a democratic one, and assumed the name of Repubblica Ligure. The King of Sardinia was also forced, in December 1798, to leave his capital ; and Piedmont was taken possession of, in the name of the French republic. Thus, at the end of 1798, Italy was covered at last with a number of mock republics, all dependent on France, powerless, spiritless, without a centre of unity, and ill suited to the character of the inhabi tants ; exposed to the ridicule of their own citizens, and to the attacks of numerous internal and external enemies. Their existence could not have been long, even if left to themselves. Their duration was, however, shorter than could have been foreseen ; they were all annihilated next year. The year 1799 was as disastrous to the French, as the year 1796 had been propitious to them. The allied Russian and Austrian armies, under the command of the famous Marshal Suwarrow, opened the campaign in the month of April, by attacking and defeating the French army, under General Scherer, near Verona. The battle of Cassano on the Adda opened to the allies the entrance into"], [279, "SUWARROW's VICTORIES. 257 Milan. The Cisalpine Directory left that capital, the Austro-Russians entered it on the 28th, and the Cisalpine republic ceased to exist. General Macdonald, after having evacuated Na ples and the South of Italy, hastened to the assist ance of his countrymen in the north ; but he was met and defeated by the Russian general at La Trebbia on the 19th of June. The Roman and Neapolitan republics, left to themselves, fell, the first without a struggle, \u2014 the second, with a useless waste of human blood, and with acts of revenge and cruelty from the triumphant party, such as to stain and disgrace their cause. Meantime Suwarrow pursued his advantages in the North with astonishing rapidity. The citadels of Milan and Turin, the fortresses of Mantua and Alessandria, surrendered rapidly one after the other. The French rallied in the Genoese territories, and endeavoured to make a stand at Novi ; but were defeated, after an obstinate engagement, on the 15th of August, with a tremendous loss. They were obliged to retire within the ramparts of Genoa, now the only place remaining in their possession beyond the Alps. At the close of 1799, the whole of Italy was in the possession of the allies ; a terrible re-action then took place, and the outrages of the peasantry and lower classes, led by men who called themselves Vol. I. S"], [280, "258 FALL OF THE NEW REPUBLICS. royalists, are too painful to relate. South Italy being more remote from the presence of the allied arms, and therefore left to itself, suffered most. The scenes that took place in Naples are well known. As for Milan, the fall of the republic did not produce either surprise or regret among the body of the people. The administration of the Directory had excited general discontent, and if the allies had acted with less severity, they would have been hailed as deliverers. But their conduct on that occasion served to alienate the Milanese from the Austrian government, for whom many of them had till then preserved a feeling of attachment. The provisional military government, which was established in the North of Italy, acted as if in a rebel and conquered country, instead of appreciating the good spirit of the great majority of the Italians and conciliating the rest, who were mostly tired of the French. The violent partisans of the latter had followed their retreating armies; a few that remained were imprisoned or banished to the Aus trian territories beyond the Alps. Next year, 1800, another unexpected change took place in the affairs of Italy. General Bona parte having returned from Egypt, and assumed the reins of the government of France under the title of First Consul, re-appeared all on a sudden,"], [281, "259 BATTLE OF MARENGO. as if by enchantment, on the Italian side of the Alps, at the head of a new army ; defeated the few troops opposed to him, and entered Milan in the beginning of June. He placed himself thus in the rear of the great Austrian army which was in Piedmont. He did not linger at Milan, but proceeded to attack General Melas ; and, on the 14th of that same month, defeated him at Marengo. Two days after, by an armistice, the French were again put in possession of the whole of Lombardy and its fortresses, as far as the river Oglio. They soon after pushed on their advanced posts beyond the Adige. Italy was again at the mercy of the French. Bonaparte did not re-establish the old Cisal pine Directory ; his views were now changed, and he was preparing for Italy the same alterations in the form of government, which he had just effected in France. He named, pro tempore, a Commission composed of three members. He employed force to close the clubs and popular societies, which were a permanent leaven of insurrection. He endea voured to quell the factions which he and his bro ther generals had been the first to excite, four years before. The situation of the Cisalpine republic, how ever, was deplorable. The effervescence which had given rise to it had subsided in most people ; the S 2"], [282, "260 COMMISSION OF GOVERNMENT. democrats were dissatisfied as well as the royal ists ; and the uncertainty of their future destiny, which they felt now depended entirely upon the will of the First Consul of France, communi cated an unsteady motion to the councils and the measures of the government. The Trium virs, for so they were called, did not secure the approbation of their countrymen any better than the Directory had done before the Austro-Russian invasion ; and, when they afterwards resigned their authority into the hands of the Vice-President Melzi, they confessed, in a circular, dated 16 plu viose, year I., of the Italian Republic, \" That the multiplicity of engagements, and the extraordinary burthens the Commission of Government had to sustain, had obliged them to take disagreeable but necessary measures. In order to support public credit, they had been obliged to hurt the private economy of the citizens, to wound them to the quick; and, at times, to re-open wounds which were nearly cicatrized.\" At last, in January 1802, when Europe was, for a short time, restored to peace, the First Consul called to Lyons an extraordinary consulta of the Cis alpine Republic, composed of the members of the le gislative council, of the commission of government ; and of deputations from the dignitaries of the church, from the courts of justice, from theuniver-"], [283, "261 CONSULTA OF LYONS. sities and academies, from the municipality and the notables of each department, from the principal towns, from the national guards, from the army, and from the commercial chambers. The number of all these deputies amounted to nearly five hun dred, out of whom was chosen a select committee of thirty members, which was to draw up a report of the state of the country. The report stated in substance, that during the few years since the institution of the Cisalpine Re public, the people of the various states of which it was composed had not become sufficiently ac quainted with one another ; that although, in each department, there were men distinguished by their abilities and virtues, they were unknown out of their own native province, and could not therefore in spire universal confidence ; that those who had had the management of affairs in these most difficult times, had not acquired a well-grounded reputation ; that it was therefore hopeless to choose amongst them a government capable of watching over the infant republic, and of giving to it a national cha racter, by making people forget their old impres sions and habits ; that, besides, the Cisalpine Re public could not yet, with safety, be evacuated by the French troops ; that, in order to obtain a due consi deration amongst the old governments of Europe, it required all the credit of a powerful ally ; that a"], [284, "262 REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE. strong arm was necessary to support the steps of the infant state and raise it to its proper sphere. The report concluded by expressing the wish that a suit able constitution should be promulgated for the Cisalpine Republic, and representatives taken from amongst the most recommendable natives, thus put ting an end to the provisional government ; while, at the same time, it was requested that the First Consul of France \" Would deign to take upon himself the administrative government of the country, and the care of the Cisalpine people for the time that would be required to bring uniformity in the different parts of the State, and to obtain the acknowledgment of the Republic from all the Powers of Europe.\" The First Consul of France, having received this report, with the tone of which, as it may be sup posed, he was previously acquainted, went to the hall of the consulta, and pronounced the following remarkable speech : \u2014 Gentlemen Deputies, \" The Cisalpine Republic, which was solemnly acknowledged by the treaty of Campo Formio, has already suffered many vicissitudes. The efforts which were made at its first establishment have turned out unfavourably.

With regard to the presidency, I have not found any one amongst you possessing sufficient influence over public opinion, who is sufficiently independent of local prejudices, or who has rendered to the state services important enough, in order to be trusted with such a high station. The report which I have received from your committee, in which both the internal and the external circumstances of your country are analyzed with as much precision as truth, has deeply affected me. I therefore agree to your wish. I shall keep, as long as circumstances will require, the im- portant care of your interests. In the midst of the continual meditations required by the station in which I find myself, whatever may concern you, and whatever may be required to consolidate your existence and your prosperity, will always form part of my most eager solicitudes. \" You have had till now municipal regulations and provincial statutes: you stand in need of general and uniform laws. Your countrymen have only local habits ; they must now assume national ones. \" Lastly, you have no military force. The powers which might one day become your enemies have powerful armies. You have, however, every thing required to form an army ; a numerous popu lation, a fertile country, and the example given to you by the first people in Europe.\""], [287, "265 REPUBBLICA ITALIANA. This speech, although upon the whole not flat tering to the Italians, excited among the deputies a lively enthusiasm. They saw the dawn of a more secure form of government than those that had afflicted their country for the preceding six years. The new constitution was proclaimed, to gether with the names of the principal functionaries, the choice of whom was such as to inspire confi dence. On the 4th of February, the new govern ment entered into office, and the name of Cisalpine was altered into that of Italian Republic The constitution of the Italian republic recog nised in theory a principle, which it, however, did not admit in practice, that sovereignty resides in the universality of the citizens. The organs of this sovereign power were placed in three electoral col leges, composed of landholders, and of learned and commercial men. The college of landholders con sisted of three hundred citizens, chosen from among those proprietors who had a yearly landed revenue of not less than six thousand livres. The college of the learned was composed of two hundred citizens, chosen among the most distin guished men in every branch of sciences and arts. The college of commerce was formed of two hundred, from amongst the most respectable and wealthy merchants or manufacturers. The members of these three colleges were for"], [288, "266 NEW CONSTITUTION. the first time named with the approbation of Bona parte ; they were to assemble at least once every two years, at the invitation of government, to fill up their vacancies, and to name the members of the le gislative body, of the consulta of state, of the superior courts of justice, and the commissaries of finance. The legislative body was composed of seventy five members, not under thirty years of age, chosen from the different departments in proportion to the population of each. They were to deliberate by secret votes, and determine a majority, without discussion, on the projects of laws which were sent to them by the government. A law could not be promulgated before three days after the decision of the legislative body. The denunciation, in this interval, of a law being unconstitutional, would suspend its promul gation and its effect. At the head of the executive government was a President (Bonaparte) for ten years, capable of being re-elected indefinitely ; he had the initiation of all the laws, and of all diplomatic negotiations. The executive power was entirely vested in him ; he named the vice-president, the ministers, the civil officers, and diplomatic agents, and the generals of the army. Bonaparte named to the vice-presidency Francesco Melzi d'Eril, of Milan, a gentleman of a distinguished family, originally Spanish, and who had already filled several situations under the Cisal-"], [289, "267 NEW CONSTITUTION. pine Republic. As Bonaparte was to reside at Paris in his quality of Chief of the French Republic, he intrusted Melzi with the necessary powers to re present him. The Consulta di Stato Avas composed of ten citizens, not under forty years of age, who had distinguished themselves for their services to the Republic, and who were especially intrusted with the examination of diplomatic treaties and foreign affairs. They also appointed to the places of judges, as well as the conciliatori or justices of peace. Large emoluments were attached to the situation of Consultor of State. The Legislative Council, in other words, a Council of State, was composed of ten citizens not under thirty, elected by the president, revocable after three years, who were to give their opinion upon the projects of law proposed by the president, and the majority was required to carry the project before the legislative body. There was also a Court of Censure, the idea of which was taken from the Roman institution of the Censors, but with very inferior powers. It con sisted of twenty-one members, named by the col leges; it received from Government the accusations of unconstitutionally, or of dilapidation of public money ; and had the power of superseding, for four years, those functionaries who were in fault. The"], [290, "268 NEW CONSTITUTION. Censors also named to those offices which were not under the patronage of either the President or the Consulta of State. The judiciary power was organized as follows : \u2014 Conciliatori, or Justices of Peace; Judges of Prima Istanza ; Courts of Appeal ; two Courts of Revision ; and a Court of Cassation. The Courts of Revision were resorted to in case of two discor dant judgments in inferior courts. The Court of Cassation was only competent to pronounce in cases of informality. Criminal Courts were instituted for the civilians ; but the military were submitted to their own courts, and judged according to the military code. The principle of the Trial by Jury was acknow ledged by the Constitution, but its practice was postponed for ten years. Of course it was never put in vigour. The questions concerning Public Administration were decided by the Legislative Council. The Chambers of Commerce pronounced in commercial cases. The Constitution did not acknowledge any civil superiority of rank but that which was derived from the exercise of public functions. This principle, like many others, lasted only till the transformation of the republic into a kingdom, when Napoleon was the first to violate it by creating an hereditary nobi lity."], [291, "269 NEW CONSTITUTION, The Constitution allowed to every inhabitant of the Republic the private exercise of his form of worship. No citizen could be arrested (except when taken in flagranti crimine,) without a written order of the competent magistrate. The Republic did not admit either prmleges or obstacles with regard to industry and commerce, interior as well as exterior, but those which were fixed by the law. \u2014 (When Napoleon became em peror his will then became law, and the principles acknowledged by the Constitution were set aside whenever inconvenient to him.) The uniformity of weights and measures, of currency, of laws, of landed tax, and of the system of elementary instruction, was decreed. A National Institute was appointed to encourage useful discoveries as well as for the advancement of sciences and arts. This was a real benefit to Italy, by giving a common focus to the minds of a considerable portion of Italians. A National Gontabilita, or Auditorship, was to inspect and verify the accounts of the income and expenditure of the Republic. The Constitution declared that the regular army was submitted to the regulations of the executive, and the national guards subordinate only to the laws. That the military ought to be essentially obedient,"], [292, "270 NEW CONSTITUTION. and that no armed body had the power of delibe rating on public questions. The debts or credits of the different provinces, which composed the territory of the Republic, was declared national. The purchases of national property, sold during the preceding Government, were acknowledged, and indemnities to be granted by the public trea sury in cases of just claims. Upon the mass of national property yet unsold, suitable emoluments were assigned to bishops and chapters, to seminaries, to rectors and curates, and for the building of churches ; and this revenue was declared inalie nable. At last, the Constitution provided : That if, after an interval of three years, the Consulta of State should judge any of the articles of the Constitution to stand in need of being reformed, it might propose it to the colleges who were to decide upon the question. The above is the substance of the Constitutional Act, which was given to the Italian Republic in 1802. After the anarchy of factions, which had tormented the country for several years, this system of government was looked upon as a real benefit. Under republican names and forms, however, the principles and tendency of the new Government were strongly monarchical ; probably, he who pre-"], [293, "271 REPOSE OF ITALY. sided at its formation, was already foreseeing the change that was to take place in a few years, and prepared the way accordingly. It was, however, a temperate form of government, in which the career of honours and emoluments was open to all citizens ; and political and religious liberty and equality before the law, were publicly acknow ledged. During the following three years, 1802, 1803, and 1804, the constitution of the Italian Republic remained in vigour, and Italy enjoyed some repose. Melzi continued vice-president. He was an accom plished, amiable, and well-informed gentleman ; yet his administration, although in peaceful times, had a character of weakness and indecision. This, perhaps, proceeded from his consciousness that he was only a subordinate agent of a man of immense power, and of the most determined volition, \u2014 and in the eye of whom the interests of the Italian Re public were subordinate to plans infinitely more extensive than the territory bounded by the Alps, the Po, the Adige, and the Sesia, which constituted what was called the Italian Republic, a name too high-sounding for one-fifth of Italy.

The Cisalpine and the Ligurian Republics continued to exist under the protection of France ; Tuscany had been given by the French to the Prince of Parma, with the title of Kingdom ; the Pope, Pius VIL, was quietly in possession of that part of his States, which had been restored to him, and he made religious concordats with the French and Italian Republics ; and the King of Naples continued at peace and undisturbed. In May, 1804, a new drama was acted at Paris. Napoleon was requested, by addresses from the Senate, representatives, and magistrates, to assume the Imperial Crown of France, with which he was afterwards crowned by the Pope, in December of the same year. From that moment the destinies of the Italian Republic were easily foreseen. It lived, however, a lingering existence for a few months longer, until March 1805. Bonaparte, First Consul of the French, and President of the Italian Republics, at peace with all the Powers of the Continent, was at the zenith of his real glory. The eyes of Europe were fixed on him, who, like a new star of the most brilliant lustre, had appeared on the political ho rizon at a most favourable period, when men were tired of the horrors of the Revolution, and of the"], [295, "273 HIS CHARACTER AS FIRST CONSUL. oppression of the unprincipled Directory. Un stained with any of those heinous crimes which had rendered France the scandal of Europe, Bo naparte was looked upon with complacency by moderate men of all parties. As a general he had not shown himself personally interested, or rapa cious ; glory seemed his object, and his too great fondness for it was easily excused in a young war rior, who, at the age of thirty, had become, through his own abilities, and by the favourable concur rence of the most astonishing events, the arbiter of the destinies of empires. His internal adminis tration, as First Consul, had been firm, wise, and conciliatory; he had healed many of the wounds of the Revolution; he was admired and praised both in France and in Italy. People, however, began to ask themselves what would the future career of this man be ? He had obtained, and it appears with the satisfaction of the great majority of the French, the Consulship for life ; would he content himself with this perpe tual dictature ? He, however, did not leave them long in suspense ; \u2014 in May 1804, he was pro claimed Emperor of France, and the execution of the Duke of Enghien was the ominous prelude to his imperial rule.

Napoleon, Emperor of the French, was still President of the Italian Republic ; but it was clear that the lattei-, which had always been the faithful satellite of its imperious ally, must follow it also in its political transformation. France, at least to a certain extents chose her emperor; Italy re ceived her king from the hands of France. Early in 1805, the Vice-President Melzi, and the members of the Consulta of State, were called to Paris ; and there, in their deliberations of the 15th of March, they expressed a wish, which was promulgated two days after in the shape of a con stitutional act, that the Emperor Napoleon, the founder of the Italian Republic, should be pro claimed King of Italy; that the crown of Italy should be hereditary in his male issue, whether real or adoptive; restraining, however, his rights of adoption to a citizen of either the French em pire, or the kingdom of Italy. The clause about the adoption seemed to be necessary, as there was no appearance of Bonaparte having any issue by has then consort Josephine."], [297, "DELIBERATIONS OF THE CONSULTA. 275 Another clause prescribed that after Napoleon's death, the crown of Italy should not remain united to that of France. The Emperor Napoleon had the right of giving himself a successor to the throne of Italy, even in his own life-time, but not until the integrity of the kingdom was secured from all danger of attack by other powers. Lastly, the Emperor Napoleon was requested to repair to Milan, in order to be there crowned, and give to his Italian subjects a definitive constitution, which should guarantee their religion, the integrity of their territory, their political and civil liberty, and the irrevocability of the sales of national property ; that taxes should only be laid according to laws, and that natives alone should be promoted to the employments of the state. The first part of this extraordinary act of the Consulta, who took upon themselves thus com pletely to alter the government of their country, was soon approved of, and their request granted. A decree of Napoleon apjoeared on the 22nd of the same month, (March,) which called upon the Italian Legislative body to assemble on the 15th of May, the electoral colleges on the 18th, and fixed the 23d for the coronation of the King of Italy. The constitutional act by which Napoleon was T2"], [298, "276 NAPOLEON, KING OF ITALY. chosen King of Italy was proclaimed at Milan on the 31st of March. On the 10th of April appeared another law, which named the great officers of the kingdom, and created four commende of thirty-six thousand livres each, annual income, which were annexed to the places of keeper of the seals, great maggior domo or steward, great chamberlain, and great ecuyer. The same law fixed the words of the oath which was to be taken by the civil officers, as well as by the military. During the same month of April, addresses were voted by the different magistrates, courts, and au thorities of the kingdom of Italy, as well as by the regiments of the Italian army, expressing their congratulations to Napoleon on his assumption of the royal dignity. A guard of honour Svas also formed at Milan. Napoleon, in company with the Empress Jose phine, made his solemn entry into Milan, on the 8th of May ; the keys of the city were presented to him by the members of the municipality. On the 26th, he was crowned King of Italy, in the cathe dral, by the Archbishop Cardinal Caprara. When the latter delivered to him at the foot of the altar, the ring, the mantle, and the sword, Napoleon gave the latter to his step-son Eugene Beauharnois, whom he had a few months before created Prince"], [299, "277 HIS CORONATION AT MILAN. of France. Then, ascending the steps of the altar, he took up the famous iron crown which had been brought from Monza for the purpose, and placed it resolutely on his own head, exclaiming at the same time : Dio me \u00a3 ha data, guai a chi la tocca. \" God has given it to me, woe to those who shall attempt to touch it !\" This, like many other modern prophecies, has been proved by the course of events an empty and useless boast. It was not considered such at the time. On the 7th of June, the new king presided at the sitting of the legislative body. An act was then read in his presence, which determined the property of the crown, authorized the monarch to appoint a viceroy, and stipulated that the three electoral colleges should assemble separately at the king's invitation, in order to choose the members of the Legislative Body, and to fill up their own vacan cies. It also decreed the formation of a Council of State, composed of the members of the old Consulta and Legislative council. Lastly, by this act, the Order of the Iron Crown was instituted, in imitation of the French Legion of Honour. At this sitting Prince Eugene took the oaths as viceroy of the kingdom of Italy, promising fidelity to the king, and to the constitution, and obedience to the laws. After this, Napoleon addressed the members of"], [300, "278 SITTING OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODY. the Legislative Body, and without alluding to the recent changes in the government of the country, entered at once into the details of his new admi- nistration, observing that he intended to establish in Italy his code of laws, which he had published in France, pointing out its superiority over the old laws, and informing them also that the Council of State was preparing a plan for the organization of the courts of the kingdom. \" I have not thought,\" he thus expressed himself, \" that the present circum- stances of Italy did allow me^to think of establish- ing the Trial by Jury. But judges will, as the juries of other countries, pronounce according to the internal conviction of their consciences, without trusting to imperfect evidences. \" I have consented that the public debt should be called Monte Napoleone, to give an additional guarantee of its credit.\" He spoke also of the order he had brought into the system of finances, which were in the most flourishing state. He said he had made suitable provisions for the clergy ; that the road of the Simplon would be terminated that same year, and a new harbour constructed at Volano near the mouth of the Po. \" None of the objects,\" he thus continued, \" con cerning which my experience in administration could be of use to my people, has been neglected"], [301, "napoleon's address to them. 279 by me.

It was evident, that in the new government, the person of the monarch was every thing, and that any remaining consti tutional principle, which might prove an obstacle to his will, would be promptly overthrown. Two days after this sitting of the Legislative Body, in which Napoleon spoke of the interest he felt for Italy, he terminated the lingering existence of the republic of Genoa, by uniting it, (9th June) not to the kingdom of Italy, but to the French empire, as he had already done with Piedmont. The last of the doges appeared himself at Milan, at the head of a deputation from the Ligurian"], [303, "PARMA ANNEXED TO FRANCE. 281 Senate, to demand its annexation to France. Thus proud Genoa followed, after a space of eight years, the fate of her old rival, Venice, and with no greater dignity. The territories of Genoa were divided into three departments, Genoa, Apennines, and Montenotte. The Duchy of Parma and Piacenza was equally incorporated with France; and in the month of July Napoleon put an end also to the republic of Lucca. It was erected into a principality, and given it his brother-in-law Prince Baciocchi. The late Vice-President Melzi, whose friends had flattered themselves that he would remain at the head of affairs, under the new king, found himself, by the nomination of the Viceroy Eugene, removed from all power and influence. He was, however, appointed by Napoleon keeper of the seals, with an annual income of thirty-six thousand francs, and was afterwards created Duke of Lodi, with an estate and title hereditary in his family. Eugene Beauharnois was only twenty-five years of age when he was appointed Viceroy of the Kingdom of Italy. He was brave, fi'ank, and generous-hearted ; he felt above all an inviolable attachment to Napoleon, which sentiment he pre served to the last, even while not approving some of the measures of his adoptive father. Having devoted till then all his time and attention solely"], [304, "282 PRINCE EUGENE BEAUHARNOIS. to military matters, he was not conversant with administrative affairs. Napoleon thought of giving him an adviser and a guide in the person of M. Mejan, secretary of prefecture in the department of the Seine. The ministers remained the same as they were under the republic, except that of justice, to which station Napoleon appointed Mr. Luosi. He also named Antonio Aldini, minister secretary of state, who was to reside near him at Paris, to prepare his decrees, and transmit his orders to the govern ment at Milan. He also directed that the minister for foreign affairs, Marescalchi, should reside at Paris, and a councillor of state to act as chief of that department at Milan. He appointed three directors to each of the departments, interior and finances, under the superintendence of the two ministers, Felici and Prina. General Pino re mained minister at war, in which situation he was afterwards succeeded by the French General Caf farelli. The ministry of the culto, or superin tendence of ecclesiastical affairs, continued intrusted to Bovara, formerly a professor in the university of Pavia. The tesoro, or paymastership, which formed a separate department of administration, remained in the hands of Veneri. This was a very numerous and expensive ad ministration for a small kingdom, consisting then"], [305, "283 HIS ATTRIBUTIONS AS VICEROY. of only fourteen departments*, but it was ac cording to Napoleon's general plan, of emrnoying a great number of persons, upon whom he could rely. The attributions of the viceroy were fixed by another decree. He superintended the labours of the different ministers, and presided at the Council of State; had the command of the military and national guards ; but Napoleon had kept to him self the right of assembling as well as adjourn ing the Legislative Body, of calling together the Electoral Colleges, and of determining the grants to be allowed to the different ministers. He had also reserved to himself the appointments to the civil situations, from that of minister to that of prefect, and to all military commissions, from general to sub-lieutenants, inclusive. It is true that, with the exception of king, and viceroy, and Viceroy's secretary, and afterwards of the minister-at-war, and a few other situations, the rest of the places in the kingdom were filled by * The name of the departments were taken from those of rivers: Olona, Agogna, Lario, Adda, Serio, Alto Po, Mella, Mincio, Crostolo, Panaro, Reno, Rubicone, Basso Po, Adige.

But this it is alleged was necessary ; the kingdom of Italy could not be left to itself. Perhaps it was so ; especially as some of the finest parts of Italy had already been incorporated to France, as we have seen ; and still more so in after years, when Tuscany, and even Rome, became annexed to the French empire : this was certainly not the manner to prepare Italy to become a nation, and act for herself. But Italy, and the kingdom of Italy, were two very different things in the plans of Napoleon. And yet some men have seriously contended that it was his in tention to unite Italy under an independent go vernment ! Had he done so from the beginning, (for he, and he alone in our times, might, perhaps, have effected it,) he might have preserved a king dom even after the loss of his empire. But his views extended further than either France or Italy, and that which would have satisfied Charles V. or Frederic II., appeared but of secondary import ance in his eyes. Napoleon had left Milan on the 10th of June, to return to France. He visited several depart ments of the kingdom, and issued many decrees,"], [307, "napoleon's measures. 285 some for the suppression of convents and the better repartition of parishes ; others for the construction of new roads, and for opening canals between the lakes and rivers of Lombardy ; and these were among his most useful works. He established military schools, and forbade his subjects from following their studies out of the kingdom ; he ordered the system of military exercises to be introduced into national schools and universities. Another decree, dated 20th of June, ordered the formation of guards of honour and royal velites ; and obliged the sons, brothers, nephews, and other young relatives of the wealthiest and most notable citizens to enrol them selves in these bodies, forbidding them to put in sub stitutes. This was a severe blow to the most dis tinguished families of the kingdom, whose fears were not unfounded ; as these guards of honour, although apparently destined merely to add to the pomp of the court, were afterwards called into ac tivity by the ambition of the ruler, whom no con sideration or principle of equity could restrain, to fight in distant countries ; and they, the flower of Italian youth, the hope of thousands of families, perished at last, chiefly of cold, hunger, and fatigue, in the disastrous campaign of Russia, with their colonels, Battaglia and Vidman, all, except five, who came to tell their relatives the mournful tale. But we must not anticipate events."], [308, "286 napoleon's measures. By the third constitutional act (6th of June) it was provided that the French code of laws should be adopted in the kingdom of Italy, under the mo difications required by local circumstances and cus toms. The minister of justice, Luosi, according to Napoleon's instruction, named two commissioners for the purpose of giving a plan of a penal code, and also one for the course of proceedings in criminal matters, conformable, however, to the principles of the civil code. This work, to which enlightened Italian jurists had contributed, being completed, was forwarded to Paris, where, to the no small surprise of the Italians, it was rejected, and an order sent back to translate ad litteram, and adopt purely and simply the code of the French empire. The projects of law of Napoleon were sent from Paris to Milan, where they were at first submitted to the approbation of the legislative body. Napoleon had taken every precaution to secure the docility of this assembly. Having, however, sent a new plan for the registro, or tax upon contracts, lega cies, #<?., the viceroy laid it before the legislative body, who fancied they were acting according to their prerogatives in discussing it, and proposing some modifications in the rates. Their observations were forwarded to Paris and communicated to Na poleon, who wrote a thundering epistle to the vice roy, telling him he was astonished that he, Eugene,"], [309, "287 BUDGET OF THE KINGDOM. could have supposed for a moment that he would listen to the remonstrances of such an assembly; that it was easier to make the moon retrograde in its course, than to make him alter his will. He then ordered him to place again the original project of law before the legislative body, and that the latter should approve of it without any further discussion. And so it was done. Not satisfied with this, a few days after (27th of July) a courier brought an order for the legislative body to close its session. The first budget of the kingdom was published in July (1805). The expenses amounted to one hundred millions of Milanese livres (about seventy six millions of francs), five-and-twenty millions of which were for the support of the French army in Italy. This latter sum was afterwards increased to thirty millions. The population of the kingdom amounted then to about four millions of inhabit ants, and the ways and means were to be supplied by the land-tax, sales of national property, stamp duties, registro, permission for shooting and fishing, judiciary taxes, licenses, tax on salt and tobacco, post-office, b)c. Besides these taxes, most of which were new to the Italians, there was, that year, a war-tax of six millions for provisioning the for tresses, and an extraordinary contribution of fifteen millions for similar objects. The latter measures showed that a new con-"], [310, "288 WAR WITH AUSTRIA AND RUSSIA. tinental war was not remote. Accordingly, while the Emperor was moving his grand army through Germany, Marshal Massena arrived in September to take the command of the army of Italy, destined to attack the Austrians on that side. On the 1st of October the Viceroy announced by proclamation the war against Austria. On the 18th Marshal Massena crossed the Adige with all his army. The Archduke Charles was opposed to him. The taking of Ulm, and the surrender of Mack's army, soon obliged the Archduke to effect his retreat by Palma Nova, and the French took possession of the Venetian states. Meantime Napoleon entered Vienna, and on the 2d of December defeated the Russians at Austerlitz. The 25th of the same month peace was concluded at Presburgh in Hungary between Austria and France, and the whole of the former Venetian states given up to Napoleon. These unfortunate Venetian provinces, thus re peatedly exchanged from one power to the other, were governed provisionally by the Viceroy Eugene, until Napoleon, by his decree, 30th of March, 1806, ordered their annexation to the kingdom of Italy, and their division into seven departments * ; but, * Bacchiglione, Brenta, Adriatico, Tagliainento, Piave, Passeriano, and Istria : Dalmatia continued to be governed as a province, as it was under the Venetian Republic."], [311, "1S9G \u2014 VENETIAN STATES ANNEXED. 289 at the same time, creating in them twelve Duchies, grands fiefs of the French empire, of which the Emperor reserved to himself the grant, attaching to them part of the revenues of those countries, besides thirty millions of national property therein situated. These Duchies bore the title of Dal matia, Istria, Friuli, Cadore, Belluno, Cornegliano, Treviso, Feltre, Bassano, Vicenza, Padova, and Rovigo, and they were given to French generals, with the condition that, in case of failure of their line, the said fiefs should return to the imperial crown of France. The system of rewarding French generals at the expense of Italy, was carried by Napoleon to a still greater extent. Having taken possession, in the same year (1806), of the kingdom of Naples, and given it to his brother Joseph, he created there several fiefs dependent in the same manner on the French empire. Three were erected also in the territory of Parma and Piacenza. Guastalla was first given to Princess Pauline Borghese, Napo leon's sister, and then, by a decree of the 24th of May 1806, reunited to the kingdom of Italy, on payment of six millions of livres, which the Italian treasury was obliged to disburse to Pauline. Be nevento and Pontecorvo, formerly belonging to the Pope, were given to Talleyrand and Bernadotte Lucca had already been given to Baciocchi. Vol. I. U"], [312, "290 MARRIAGE OF THE VICEROY. In January 1806, Eugene married Augusta Amelia, princess of Bavaria. The Italians flattered themselves that this marriage would ensure to Eu gene's succession the independent throne of Italy ; but they were still far from the mark. In September, 1806, the war against Prussia took place. This war, more remote than that of the preceding year, concerned the Italians less. However, Italian regiments were sent to share the honour of that campaign. The conscription, which, in 1805, had amounted to six thousand men, was resorted to again, and nine thousand men were raised by this oppressive means in January 1807. The sanguinary battles of Eylau and Friedland were followed by the peace of Tilsit, in July 1807. Yet, in October of the same year, ten thousand men more were raised by conscription in the king dom of Italy. In November, the same year, Napoleon came to visit again his Italian kingdom. He went to his newly-acquired city of Venice, and was received with a pomp truly magnificent. He visited, ac cording to his invariable custom, the public es tablishments, the fortifications, the arsenal; and issued several wise local regulations and provident measures. But he could not prevent the natural"], [313, "1807 \u2014 NAPOLEON'S DECREES. 291 progress of the decay of Venice, fallen from the rank of a capital, to that of a provincial town of a small kingdom. On his return to Milan, he issued the famous Mi lan Decree (17th of December,) in which, carrying still further the principles of his previous Decree from Berlin against the English, he put an end to all neutral trade by sea. Meantime the sequestra tion of English goods throughout the kingdom, goods which had been mostly purchased by Italian merchants, and afterwards the burning of them in the public squares, were measures calculated to create disaffection, and what was perhaps worse, to bring his policy into ridicule and contempt, by showing the impotence of his revenge. Having assembled the three electoral colleges, (20th of December, 1807,) he communicated to them a statute by which he appointed a senate in lieu of the legislative body, which he had dis solved two years before, as we have seen. This senate was to submit to the sovereign its observa tions upon the wants and the wishes of the nation, and the budgets were in future to be laid before it. There happened never to be, however, a disparity of opinion between the sovereign and the senate. On the same occasion Napoleon addressed the u 2"], [314, "292 napoleon's visit to Milan. electoral colleges, and told them he saw them with pleasure assembled round his throne. \u2014 \" Having returned amongst you,\" he continued, \" after an absence of two years, I am pleased in perceiving the progress these my people have made. But much remains yet to be done in order to cancel the errors of your ancestors, and to render you worthy of the destinies I am preparing for you. \" The internal dissensions of our forefathers, and their miserable municipal egotism, were the causes of the loss of all their rights. Italy was disinherited from its rank and dignity ; she that had in remote ages carried so far the honour of her arms and the splendour of her virtues.

But they had by this time opened their eyes, and were perfectly aware of the nature of their political situation. Maria Louisa of Spain, widow of the Prince of Parma, upon whose infant son Bonaparte had be stowed by treaty in 1801 the possession of Tuscany under the name of the Kingdom of Etruria, was invited to meet the Emperor at Milan. She came with the young King, was present with Napoleon at several fetes, but the latter had already views hostile to the dynasty of Spain; and, next month, January 1808, it was known that Tuscany, the finest, the most central, the most classical part of modern Italy, w as to be taken possession of by the French ; and in June, the same year, Tuscany was united to the French empire, and divided into three departments, Arno, Mediterranean, and Ombronc. Before the completion of this event, the editor of a weekly journal of Milan, called il Corriero delle Dame, which was chiefly filled with accounts of the fashions and with light poetical effusions, giving also a brief summary of the news of the week extracted from the official journals, happened to insert in one of his numbers the following words : \u2014 \" The des tinies of Etruria appear to be arrived at their ma turity.\" This passage was shown to Napoleon, who, offended that his views should be made known before the time, ordered the editor to be confined"], [316, "294 STATE OF THE PRESS. in a mad-house. This was executed, and the un fortunate editor was very near losing his reason in the company into which he was thus forced. The regulations concerning the press of the kingdom of Italy abolished the censure which existed under the Italian republic, but esta blished a bureau or office, to which authors were invited to submit their manuscripts, before sending them to press, in order that they might not be molested. Melchior Gioja, of Piacenza, had written at the beginning of the French dominion in Italy, a work favourable to them, styled / Russi, i Tedeschi, ed i Francesi in Lombardia. He now, availing him self of the abolition of the censure, published another pamphlet styled II povero Diavolo, in which he ridiculed the conduct of some of the ministers of the kingdom. This gave offence ; ac cording to the decree just mentioned, Gioja, being naturalized in the kingdom, ought to have been proceeded against before the regular courts, but the result of a trial could not be well relied upon. A more summary way was taken \u2014 he was banished the kingdom. Some years after (1811) another man of letters, Lampredi, the editor of a journal styled II Poli grafo, ventured some critical remarks upon the style of a funeral oration composed by one of the"], [317, "295 INCREASE OF EXPENSES. counsellors of state ; he was called before the po lice, and ordered not to exert any longer his criti cism upon the compositions of any public function ary. The spirited Lampredi said, that since that was the case, he preferred leaving the kingdom, retiring to Tuscany, his native country. The budget of the expenses for 1807 had amounted to one hundred and fourteen millions ; that for 1808 amounted to one hundred and twenty. Napoleon granted pensions to the astronomer Oriani, to the poets Cesarotti, Monti, and others. He also appointed a commission for the embellish ment of Milan. He patronised arts and sciences, and even letters, when the latter showed themselves submissive to his principles and views. In 1808 the Spanish war began, and Italian troops, and distinguished Italian generals, were sent to that country to fight by the side of the French. At the same time dissensions arose be tween Napoleon and the Court of Rome, the only remaining one of the old Italian governments. The French troops were already in possession of the fortress of Ancona, and now they spread themselves over that fine part of the papal territories situated between the Adriatic and the Apennines, and known under the name of Le Marche. On the 2d of April these provinces were united to the"], [318, "296 ANNEXATION OF ANCONA. kingdom of Italy, and divided into three depart ments, Metauro, Musone, and Tronto. A levy of twelve thousand men by conscription, was ordered in November this year. In April, 1809, a new war with Austria broke out. The Viceroy was appointed to command the army on the side of Italy. The Archduke John of Austria had the command of the troops op posed to him. The Austrians were the first to cross the frontier ; the Archduke issued proclama tions, telling the Italians what they knew very well : \u2014 \" The kingdom of Italy,\" he said, \" is but a phantom, a vain name. You are only the slaves of France ; you sacrifice to her your gold and your blood. Conscription, burdens, oppressions of every sort, the nullity of your political existence, these are facts.\" The Italians, assenting to all this, might have replied to the Archduke, that, unfor tunately, they could not expect that Austria would restore them to their independence, and that theirs was only a choice of evils. The two armies, commanded by Eugene and the Archduke, met on the 18th of April, near the river Piave. The action was long disputed ; at last the Austrian cavalry, far superior in number to the Italian, decided the day ; and the Viceroy, after conducting himself with his wonted bravery, was obliged to retire towards the Adige. His loss"], [319, "1809 \u2014 NEW WAR WITH AUSTRIA. 297 amounted to twelve thousand men. The Tyrolese had, at the same time, taken up arms and entered the departments on their side. Alarm had already spread at Milan, when the successes of Napoleon in Germany obliged the Archduke John to retire and run to the assistance of Vienna. That capital was again occupied by the French. Thence Napoleon issued a decree (May, 1809) by which he ordered the occupation of Rome and of the remainder of the papal states. The battles of Esling and Wagram were fol lowed by an armistice, and afterwards by the peace of Vienna in October. The marriage of Napoleon with an Archduchess of Austria was stipulated ; and those Italians, who still had flattered them selves with the idea of their future independence, saw every prospect of it removed further than ever by this event. In 1810, Napoleon incorporated Rome and the papal territories, between the Apennines and the Mediterranean Sea, with the French empire. At the same time that the kingdom of Italy was thus cir cumscribed to the west and south, Napoleon had, in December, 1809, by his message to the Italian senate, informed them that the provinces of Dal matia and Istria, formerly Venetian, were to be united under the denomination of Illyrian provinces,"], [320, "298 ROME AND DALMATIA ANNEXED. to the French empire, which was thus extending it self also round the eastern frontier of the kingdom. The Viceroy advised the senate to respect in silence certain combinations which separated those pro vinces from the kingdom. His advice was strictly followed. A levy of eleven thousand men was ordered for this year, and the budget of expenses amounted to one hundred and twenty-seven millions. A decree, dated May, ordered the suppression of all the remaining convents, and other ecclesiastical corporations and congregations of every sort, for bidding individuals to appear in the dress of their order. In June the southern part of the Tyrol was united to the kingdom of Italy. The whole of Italy was, at last, in 1810, under the direct power of Napoleon. Piedmont, Genoa, Tuscany, and the southern Roman states, were de partments of the French empire; the rest of the Peninsula was divided into two kingdoms, Naples and Italy. We have thus followed the course of events to the consummation of Napoleon's organization of Italy, which state of things continued unaltered till his final reverses in 1814 ; when Murat from the south, and the Austrian and English armies in the"], [321, "1811-12 CONSCRIPTIONS. 299 north, obliged the French to retire once more beyond the Alps, after having for eighteen years kept their footing on Italian ground. I have dwelled chiefly, and at some length, considering the limits of this sketch, upon the measures of the internal administration of the king dom of Italy ; the history of its external affairs being included in the history of Napoleon. A conscription of fifteen thousand men was de creed in January 1811. Another of the same number was ordered in November, the same year. Fresh taxes were raised, and new and rigorous measures of police taken. Several literary and political journals were suppressed. All these dis posals showed symptoms of approaching troubles. The budget for 1811 amounted to one hundred and thirty-two millions. Next year (1812) is memorable for the disas trous campaign of Russia. The Viceroy, with the Italian army, shared the mournful glory and the unheard-of calamities of that expedition. From the ruins of Moscow, Napoleon decreed a new levy of fifteen thousand men in the kingdom of Italy. In December, the famous twenty-ninth bulletin was made known at Milan, and completely rent the dark veil which had been cautiously drawn over the misfortunes of the French and Italian armies. The Italians, whose sentiments towards the French"], [322, "300 1813 \u2014 prince eugene's return. had already considerably cooled, were now over powered in reading the details of such frightful disasters. Thousands of families mourned over the loss of their dearest relatives ; yet the conscription in the kingdom of Italy had not been so severe as in the other parts of the Peninsula which were an nexed to the French empire. In February, 1813, a decree ordered a new levy of fifteen thousand men in the kingdom of. Italy. The budget was carried this year to one hundred and forty-four millions. In May, same year, the Viceroy, after having distinguished himself in the retreat of the remains of the French army, of which he had the supreme command, returned to Milan. He began to take measures for the defence of the Italian states. He formed a corps of observation near Verona, where the Italian guards soon after assembled. In the following August he announced to the Italians by a proclamation, dated from his head-quarters at Gorizia, the beginning of a new war against Austria. He removed thence, in October, to Gradiska, whence he ordered a new levy of fifteen thousand men to be taken from the supernumeraries of all the former conscriptions, and to be raised in fifteen days. Similar measures, however, were now become im practicable. The Viceroy was soon after obliged to evacuate the Venetian territories. Mistrust, fear, and"], [323, "1811 AUSTRIAN INVASION. 301 confusion, began to spread in every quarter. The star of Napoleon was evidently setting in France, and the Italians saw the crisis approaching also for them; a crisis from which they hardly knew whether they had more to hope than to fear. On the 22d of January, 1814, Napoleon, by a decree dated the Thuilleries, ordered that the con tribution of thirty millions, till then paid by the kingdom of Italy to the French, should cease. The Austrians had reached once more the banks of the Adige. English troops, under the orders of General Nugent, had landed at the mouths of the Po. In February, 1814, the latter General entered Bologna \u2014 Ferrara was also occupied by the allies. The kingdom of Italy was falling to pieces. At last, in March 1814, Murat, who had occu pied the Roman states, threw off the mask and joined the allies. He attacked the Italian troops in the territory of Modena, and obliged them to fall back on the Po. Eugene saw himself then obliged to retire upon the Mincio, under the pro tection of the fortress of Mantua, his last strong hold. On the 29th of March, the Vice-queen left Milan to retire to Mantua. This young princess was universally regretted ; her virtues, her charity, and"], [324, "302 CONVENTION OF MANTUA. her amiable qualities, had won the respect and attachment of every one. A military convention was concluded in April, between Prince Eugene and the Austrian Field marshal Bellegarde, by which hostilities were sus pended. The Field-marshal visited Prince Eugene at Mantua, and stood godfather to his new-born daughter. Meantime the news of Napoleon's ab dication were received in Italy. By the convention, the French troops were to withdraw from Italy and return to France. Prince Eugene addressed to them a proclamation, in which, taking leave of them, he told them he was to remain among the Italians. There was, on this occasion, much political ma n\u0153uvring on the part of the Viceroy's friends to engage the senate to proclaim him king, and send a deputation to the allied monarchs to that effect. The senate assembled in the evening of the 19th of April, to deliberate on the measures to be taken in this momentous crisis. The public mind was di vided; \u2014 one party wished for a liberal constitution, independent of foreigners, whether French or Aus trians ; \u2014 another, among whom were many of the nobility and clergy, preferred the return of the Austrian authority. The people of Milan had begun to assemble, and to shew signs of restlessness"], [325, "303 DISTURBANCES AT MILAN. and insubordination. The senate resolved that a de putation should be sent to the allies to demand the independence of the kingdom, but without men tioning Prince Eugene. It is remarkable that, in this crisis, an address was forwarded to the podesta or first magistrate of Milan, signed by a great number of citizens, by which they demanded that, \" in the actual extra ordinary circumstances, it was indispensable to as semble the electoral colleges, in whom alone the lawful representation of the nation resides.\" Thus, after several years of the most absolute sway, the original principles of the compact of the Italian constitution were not forgotten. Next day, 20th of April, the senate assembled again. An immense crowd of people of all ranks took their station before the palace, threatening those senators whom they thought favourable to Eugene, as they arrived. The spirit of the people seemed, in general, unfavourable to the idea of having Eugene for king. Tumultuous and sedi tious cries were uttered ; the national guards came for the protection, as it was said, of the senate ; and the people rushed after them through the courts and the stairs of the palace. The president then moved that the electoral col leges should be called together, and the sitting was closed."], [326, "304 PR1NCE EUGENE LEAVES ITALY. But the mob, once in motion, was not satisfied with this ; they penetrated into the interior of the palace, broke to pieces Napoleon's bust, threw the furniture out of the windows, and obliged the sena tors to seek their safety in flight. From the palace of the senate, the crowd rushed to that of the finances, and there the murder of Prina was perpetrated. This deplorable event has already been related in a preceding chapter of this work. Next day, 21st, the respectable citizens assembled in arms for the common safety, and succeeded in restoring order. Meantime Eugene learned the events of Milan, and gave up every idea of ruling the kingdom. He determined to retire to Bavaria, whose king was his father-in-law. The electoral colleges were assembled at Milan, and a regency formed. A deputation was sent to the head-quarters of the allied powers to claim the independence of the kingdom, and a moderate liberal constitution under an hereditary dynasty. The decision of the allied powers was not favour able to these demands. On the 28th of April two Austrian divisions entered Milan. On the 23d of May following, a proclamation of Marshal Belle garde announced to the Milanese that he had taken possession of Lombardy, and of the remainder of the"], [327, "305 RESTORATION. former Austrian territories in Italy, in the name of the Emperor his sovereign ; and that, from that moment, the electoral colleges, the senate, and the council of state, were dissolved. Here ends the history of the kingdom of Italy. The provinces composing that kingdom, which were on the left bank of the Po, namely, the Mi lanese, Venetian, and Mantuan territories, returned under the dominion of the house of Austria, under the name of Regno-Lombardo-Veneto, with a po pulation of four millions ; those on the right bank of the same river which formerly belonged to the pope, were restored to the papal government ; the Modenese territory was given to the Archduke of Modena, and the territory of Novara was annexed to the Sardinian kingdom. What were the characteristics of Napoleon's ad ministration in the north of Italy ? His principle was that of absolute power enforced in the most decided manner ; he seemed to think that persons and properties belonged to him exclusively ; and those free institutions which he at first allowed his subjects to retain, were violated by him, without any scruple, whenever they stood in the way of his transcendant projects. This affected principally the general or political concerns of the state ; it affected its exterior commerce, which was nearly annihilated Vol. I. X"], [328, "306 NAPOLEON'S ADMINISTRATION. by the maritime war; the happiness of families, which was destroyed by repeated conscriptions : the wealth and credit of the country, which were drained by an oppressive taxation and an expensive adminis tration, more ostentatious than regular or solid. The Italians followed the car of the conqueror, or sacrificed themselves before it. In the details, however, of civil administration, and especially in the system of laws and organisa tion of the tribunals, the principle of equality be fore the law was acknowledged; the trials were public, the judges equitable. A good police watched over the internal safety of the kingdom, mendicity was suppressed in great measure; interior com merce was facilitated by canals and new roads; education was spread and facilitated by the system of gradual schools; the national institute was a focus of learning and genius. A numerous and gallant army of sixty thousand men had been formed, of which a great part however was sacri ficed in Spain, Russia, and Germany, for interests foreign to Italy. A new impulse was given to the people, and this impulse has not been lost on the national character; the Italians, naturally reflective, are now better informed and better acquainted with their own situation. The lessons of experience"], [329, "307 ON THE AUSTRIAN GOVERNMENT. have not been lost upon them. They are more cautious and less dogmatic in their opinions, and considerate in their judgments. What has been the conduct of the Austrian government since Italy has returned under its do minion? Uncertain, wavering, and deficient in tact, rather than oppressive by principle. Often, with the best intentions, the Austrian authorities do not understand properly how to act. An old Italian gentleman was one day stating the difference be tween the French and Austrian rule : \u2014 \" The former,\" he said, \" when they came to Italy, pil laged us, shot our relatives, took our sons away, seduced our women, in short, did us every sort of injury; but, with so good a grace, that we, the sufferers, were pleased with them against our bet ter judgment, and forgave them. The latter (Aus trians) do not do one half of the mischief their an tagonists did, and yet we cannot like them ; they do not take any pains to please us, or to flatter our prejudices.\" The taxes in general have remained as they were under the French, but the advantages of the French judiciary system have been taken away. The con scription is by no means so extensive as it was, but the chances of promotion are also much lesser. The police remains vigilant and good. The Austrian troops are orderly and regular, but they do not X 2"], [330, "308 AUSTRIAN GOVERNMENT. associate so much with the inhabitants as the French did, the latter were especially favourites with the women. The measures of the administration are damped by the want of sufficient power vested in the authorities who reside at Milan, the aulic council at Vienna must approve of every determi nation *. It is needless to say more. It is a great pity that the Austrian government, which is considered good and paternal in its German states, does not come to a serious determination to give its Italian subjects a form of administration suited to the wants of an intelligent but steady and orderly race of people. * Among recent travellers who have treated this sub ject, the author of the \" Letters from the North of Italy\" has written with most moderation and candour, and has taken most pains in his researches. Yet, I believe, that after reading his statement, the dispassionate reader will draw con clusions not very dissimilar from mine. END OF VOL LONDON PRINTED BY W.

CHAPTER I. SARDINIAN STATES. .AFTER spending several months in Switzer land, it is with heartfelt satisfaction that I find myself once more on the south side of the Alps, in the beautiful plains of Piedmont, and this too in a most delightful time of the year. Having visited Lyons, the second city of France, I left it by the Turin diligence. We travelled the whole night ; passed through Bourgoin and la Tour du Pin, two small French towns ; and arrived at Pont Beau voisin, on the frontiers of Savoy, next morning by ten o'clock. There we were detained four hours by the Piedmontese custom-house officers, who examined every part of the baggage. They are civil to passengers ; when they have no suspicion of their concealing any contraband articles, they Vol. II. B"], [340, "2 FRONTIERS OF SAVOY. do not empty their trunks, but merely overlook the contents, taking care not to injure them. I have found the custom-house officers of the King of Sardinia the- best behaved of any I have met in the whole of my travels. They are well clothed and well paid, and do not seem susceptible of bri bery ; I have met with the same disinterested spirit in the Piedmontese police officers, and in the carabineers, who do their duty very well, and keep the roads perfectly safe ; and I am happy to be able to pay them this compliment; they reflect credit upon their government and upon their country. Pont Beauvoisin is a small town divided in two by the river Guier, which forms the boundary be tween France and Savoy. On the bridge which unites the two districts of the town, there are on each side sentries of their respective nations. The French part is the best built. As I was standing in the middle of the square near the post-house, I could read the inscription of eight or ten inns, coffee houses, and billiard-rooms dignified by high-sound ing names. I suppose that the military, the custom house and police officers, and the other people employed by government, form the principal part of the inhabitants of the place, and that they spend their frequent leisure hours in public places to kill time. The situation of Pont Beauvoisin is"], [341, "CUSTOM-HOUSE AND SMUGGLERS. 3 low, and surrounded by high grounds, and I think it must be rather unhealthy in summer. The part of it belonging to Savoy seems poorer and of less consequence than that on the French side. While the custom-house officers were visiting the goods with which the diligence is generally loaded, we got our dinner, and at two o'clock we started again. We soon arrived at the pas du Chail, which is the first defile one meets in enter ing Savoy. The road is narrow and cut out of the perpendicular rock on the brink of a fearful precipice, at the bottom of which runs the river Guier. It is over this frightful chasm that smug glers venture often in the depths of night, climb the rocks at the risk of being precipitated into the abyss below, and wading through the river, pass from one territory into the other, notwithstanding the gens d'armes are on the watch for them; and thus they run the chance of losing their property, and with it their liberty, and sometimes their lives. Still the temptation is so great on account of the heavy duties by which the governments of Europe have thought proper to fetter commerce, that numbers of people are known to live by smuggling all along the frontiers. Guilty as they are of breaking; the laws of the country, I cannot help compassionating in some degree many of these people, whom real necessity and want of B2"], [342, "4 PASS OF LES ECHELLES. resources in these inland districts lead to follow this dangerous and illegal course of life. What nights of watching, fatigue, and anxiety, they must pass when engaged in their expeditions ; the profits of which very often serve to enrich their employers who rest secure at home, and who give them such a poor reward as is barely sufficient to support existence ! With what throbbing hearts must their families be waiting their return ! The subject is certainly very sad, and one of the evils of the present system. The gens d'armes or cara bineers trace out the smugglers, like hunters after their prey. I observed the manoeuvres of some of them who had got scent of a depot of contraband goods, concealed in a solitary house situated on the Savoy bank of the river, near the road ; those who were on foot surrounded the place at a distance, con cealing themselves behind the bushes ; one of the party who was mounted, galloped up to the house, when all the rest rushed in. Our carriage driving on, I could not learn any thing of the success, but I felt that the scene was a most unpleasant one to reflect upon. We arrived at sunset at the great pass of les Echelles, one of the most romantic spots I have ever seen. A range of table mountains, which I believe to be a secondary chain of Alps, runs across Savoy, between the Rhone and the Isere, and seems to"], [343, "5 LES ECHELLES. forbid the approach to Italy on that side, forming as it were an outwork of the great Alpine barrier. Formerly, the only way to proceed was by steps cut in the rock, accessible only to pedestrians, and resembling ladders, from which the pass took the name of les Echelles. Charles Emmanuel II., Duke of Savoy, had a road opened by mines through this mass of rocks for a length of about two miles ; a most useful and noble undertaking. An inscription remains in commemoration of the sovereign who had it constructed. The road is winding ; the cliffs are in some places nearly a thousand feet high and almost perpendicular. A solemn stillness reigns in this region. At a tre mendous height above your heads, a few sheep and goats, scarcely distinguishable by sight, are stray ing on the crags which overhang the precipice ; and higher up, the azure sky contrasts with the grey colour of the rocks by which you appear enclosed on every side, so as not to perceive any issue. The whole forms a most wild and dreary scene. In the midst of these horrors, the singular apjoear ance of a beggar stationed on one side of the road, strikes the traveller. I was told this man had lived twenty years in this place, in a kind of wooden hut built against the rock, ten feet in length and six in breadth; there he sleeps, works, cooks his scanty repast, and collects the alms of the"], [344, "6 GALLERY OF LES ECHELLES. passengers. A strange existence, which still must have some attractions ! At the entrance of the pass we had left our car riage, as the ascent is very steep and fatiguing for the horses; to avoid the worst part of it, a gallery has been cut through the rock; it is more than eight hundred feet in length, by twenty-five in breadth. This cut was begun by Bonaparte, and has just been finished by the present King of Sar dinia, who seems not to neglect these kinds of im provements in his territories. After twenty minutes' walk through the rocky glen, we saw the sun again, the pass becoming less steep and the mountains lower, and we began to descend towards Chambery. Les Echelles forms on this side a na tural defence to Savoy; but the country is open and accessible on the south, towards Grenoble. We passed the night at Chambery: the situation of this place is romantic, in a valley closely sur rounded by the lofty Alps ; the town itself is poor and indifferently built ; the governor of Savoy resides in it ; it has a senate, which is the supreme court of justice of the duchy. There are many noble families in this place, but generally they have small incomes. They re tain, however, much of the pride of feudal times ; they were once overbearing to the pea santry, but this is now over, and things tend"], [345, "CHAMBERY. 7 rather to the opposite extreme. The Savoyards are sincere, but passionate; honest and faithful, but headstrong ; charitable among themselves, but the lower classes, notwithstanding this, are much inclined to beg from the traveller, without always having the excuse of real want. A great number of them leave their country, and wander about Europe, subsisting by different kinds of labour. Numbers of them used to resort to Paris, where they performed sundry menial offices, as porters, messengers, and sweeps, and where their honesty and industry had become proverbial. The country women are the most submissive servants of their husbands, as in all rude countries; they stand waiting behind their chairs, while they are at table, and never take their meals until their lords have finished. The inhabitants of Chambery, and of other towns of Savoy, speak good French. The men of letters write with great elegance and purity of style. One of them, Le Chevalier Maistre, published some time ago a curious little work, under the title of \" Voyage autour de ma Chambre\" ; in which he has imitated with success the style of Sterne's Sentimental Journey. The Savoyards have acquired much of French manners and ideas during the last twenty years, and consequently a certain prepossession in favour"], [346, "8 SAVOYARDS. of their late masters. The restored government has also perhaps neglected them, and showed a preference to its Italian subjects, the Piedmontese. In the late revolution of 1821, however, the Sa voyards remained quiet. On leaving Chambery, as my fellow-travellers and I were walking before the diligence, we met a young peasant carrying a bundle of hay : \u2014 \" Ah, messieurs, si fetois comme vous, je ne porterois pas cette botte de foin,\" said he with a significant look of envy, and an expression of ill concealed dis satisfaction at the supposed superiority of our lot. A short distance from Chamberv, I was struck with the appearance of a fine country-house and gardens on the right of the road, which belong to a native of this country, who made his fortune in India. A curious story was told me of his hav ing been high in rank in the service of Tippoo Saheb, and of his having betrayed his master into the hands of the English ; and although I replied that Tippoo had perished on the breach at the storming of his own capital, the Savoyard who related me this tale, did not seem persuaded of its untruth. The nabob, as he is called, has lived for many years in this place, in complete retirement ; his countrymen seem prejudiced against him, and avoid his company. He succeeded lately in marrying a natural son of his to a young lady of Chambery,"], [347, "9 MONTMELIAN. to the great disapprobation of the rigorists ; but money is as great a temptation in Savoy as else where. It must be said in his favour, that he employs a good part of his fortune in charitable purposes. The country about Chambery is the most fertile part of Savoy. On approaching Montmelian, I noticed the curious aripearance of a rock on the left, which resembles the -head of a sphynx, and preserves the same resemblance on every side. The situation of Montmelian is picturesque, and seems important in a military point of view. It is built at the foot of a steep mountain on the right bank of the Isere, and commands the pass of that river. Four deep valleys open from it ; \u2014 the one by which you come from Chambery ; another on the left, leading into the high Alps of Tarentaise ; the third, to the right, following the course of the Isere to Grenoble; and the fourth, opening into the province of Maurienne, through which the road to Italy leads. The Austrians and the French had some hard fighting at this place, in 1814. The road, after crossing the Isere, ascends slowly, winding between two chains of Alps, which rise higher and higher, and seem to close at Aigue belle. The situation of this town would afford a fine subject for an Alpine landscape."], [348, "10 VALLEY OF MAURIENNE. We dined at Aiguebelle ; and, proceeding on our route, turned round a mountain into the valley of Maurienne, a poor barren country. The river Arc, which descends from Mount Cenis, runs through the whole of Maurienne, and empties itself into the Isere between Aiguebelle and Mont- melian. The road keeps along the banks of this stream all the way to the foot of Mont Cenis. We passed in the evening Saint Jean de Mauri- enne, the principal town of the province. The approach to Italy is here gradually felt : the sounds of the patois become more like the Pied- montese ; the appearance of the people is more Italian ; there is more expression in their coun- tenance, and more warmth in their address. The sky was pure and brilliant, and the moon shone brighter than I had seen it for a long time. We passed the night at Saint Michel, a small town with a tolerably good inn, where the diligences to and from Italy regularly stop. Starting early in the morning, we passed the forest of Bramant, and found ourselves in the very middle of the Alps, some of their highest peaks covered with eternal snow towering above the rest. We saw to the left Mont Iseran, whence the Isei'e takes its source ; Mont Cenis before us, and the Col de Sestrieres on the right, over which there is a passage practi cable in summer leading to Fenestrelle. In the"], [349, "11 NEW FORTRESS OF BRAMANT. midst of these solitudes, the Sardinian govern ment has since the last peace raised the new for tress of Bramant, on a rock surrounded on all sides by dreadful precipices, and the batteries of which command the pass. It is an important out work in defence of Italy. After passing the vil lage of Lanslebourg, we began to ascend Mont Cenis ; the road winds along the side of the moun tain, the ascent is easy, it was free from snow, and we had a beautiful sunny day. In about three hours we were at the summit of the ascent. This is the place where in winter time people slide down over the snow, on little sledges directed by a man in front, and they reach the bottom in eight or ten minutes, while it would take them an hour and a half by the carriage road. There have been instances of English travellers, so very fond of impetuous motion, as to repeat the experiment two or three times following, re-ascending the mountain for the purpose of being hurled down again from the top of it. De gustibus non est disputandum, is a common proverb in Italy. This place is called La Ramasse. The road striking across to the left, we lost sight at once of the valleys of Savoy, and saw nothing but craggy summits covered with snow, and a few fir-trees scattered round the sides of the mountains. As we proceeded, however, towards the little"], [350, "12 MONT CENIS, OR MONTE CINISIO. plain on the summit of Mont Cenis, the view be came more extensive and varied. A lake of the most brilliant azure, and of about a mile in length, occupies the centre of the plain ; its banks are covered with fine green pastures, mixed with wild flowers and aromatic herbs, and the scenery is enclosed on all sides by Alps rising upon Alps. We passed the post-house and went to pay a visit to the Hospice, wliich is an extensive building, intended for the purpose of affording shelter and assistance to travellers. We met two regular priests belonging to a house of their order at Turin ; they regaled us with some excellent trout from the neighbouring lake, some Mont Cenis cheese, which is renowned both in Piedmont and France for its richness; stale bread, sour wine and fruit. They make no regular charge for the re freshments they give ; but those travellers who can afford it leave a small discretionary present for the benefit of the institution. Poor people are sheltered and fed gratis. Napoleon supported this esta blishment, which was useful to his troops, who were constantly passing this road ; and the present government continues to maintain it. There are revenues attached to the institution, besides the monopoly of the fishery of the lake. We parted from the friendly monks and continued our journey, following the course of the Dora, which takes its"], [351, "APPROACH TO ITALY. 13 rise in this mountain. We were now on Italian ground, but nothing was to be seen as yet of the plains of that delightful country. Italy, like a pretty coquette, seems to be retreating before you ; you have a gli npse of her in descending to Susa, but you do not see her in her loveliness until long after you have passed that town, and are arrived in the plains of Turin. The Italian side of Mont Cenis, as well as that of the Simplon, is wilder and more abrupt than the opposite side. The rocks are steeper, the pre cipices are more frequent and deeper ; nature has surrounded her favorite Italy with these horrors, like the fabulous dragons watching the entrance of the garden of the Hesperides. We passed the plain of St. Nicholas, a deep valley, encompassed on all sides by mountains almost perpendicular; it is a dangerous pass in stormy weather, when the snow is drifted about, so as to cover all traces of the road, and bewilder the poor traveller. To prevent these accidents, long poles are stuck in the ground at short distances from each other ; and refuges, or shelter houses of strong masonry, have been built to afford asylum against the fury of the elements. The descent becomes steeper and steeper ; it forms a zig-zag with very sharp angles. We arrived at five o'clock at Melaretto, the first Piedmontese"], [352, "14 SUSA post-house. Here nature assumes a milder aspect ; we left behind us the dreary horrors of Alpine scenery, and there remained only the romantic, pleasing features of the valley. We noticed also the difference in the dress of the postilions ; the em broidered military jacket of the French gives place to the short Italian jacket and trowsers of striped velveteen ; half-boots are substituted for the enor mous French jack-boots, and the red sash of the south begins to make its appearance. The lan guage is the Piedmontese, the least Italian of the dialects of Italy. We arrived at Susa about sunset. It was a Sun day evening, and I perceived visible signs of the Sabbath, which, in France, is hardly discernible from other days. The shops were shut, and number of cleanly dressed females, in their holiday garb, vrere returning from church. I felt real pleasure in seeing this ; the Italians, with all their frailties and follies, still preserve that respect for the re ligion of their forefathers, which is connected with the best feelings of the heart. Susa is an ancient looking town, pleasantly situated on the banks of the Dora, and at the very foot of the Alps, and surrounded by gardens and vineyards. It had an ancient castle, called La Brunetta, which was considered very strong, but"], [353, "15 RIVOLI. it was razed by the French in the late wars. Here the climate, the architecture, the appearance of the people \u2014 every thing is Italian. We left Susa next morning early, and followed a narrow valley, along the river Dora. We passed Avegliana, beyond which the landscape becomes wider and the country finer, until at last, on ap proaching Rivoli, you see at once the wide fertile plains of the Po opening before you, with the majestic Alps forming a crescent at a distance ; the fine avenue of Rivoli, the domes of the capital, and the stately sanctuary of Superga. The whole constitutes a magnificent amphitheatre : this is real Italy! this is il bel paese, \" Ch' Apennin parte, e '1 mar circonda c Y Alpe.\" The road between Susa and Rivoli being very bad, the King had given orders to repair it, but go vernment seems not to be seconded by its subalterns . Instead of mending the old road, which might easily be done, they were constructing, at a great expense, a new one, at a short distance from the former, by which means the commissioners enrich themselves, the people grumble, and all parties complain, to the satisfaction of the evil intentioned. This is the way in which most things at present are carried on in Italy. Rivoli is a small town, about seven miles from Turin; it has a palace belonging to the king,"], [354, "16 TURIN who spends here a part of the year. A superb, straight avenue, with double rows of trees, leads to the capital. We arrived at Turin at eleven in the morning ; we entered by the Porta Susina, and the fine street of Dora Grossa. Turin is perhaps of all the Italian capitals, the least noticed by travellers, although, in my opinion, it deserves a distinguished place among them. This unmerited neglect is probably owing to the short stay that English and other travellers make in it. A foreigner, arriving by Mont Cenis, feels generally such a strong attraction drawing him towards the south ; Florence, Rome, and Naples, are objects of such magnitude in his view, that he cannot linger on the very threshold of Italy, and after a day or two spent in visiting the gallery of paintings in the king's palace, in sauntering under the arcades of Strada Po, and in peeping in at the theatres, he hastens to quit Turin, with few last ing impressions remaining in his mind. At his return, he either takes the road by Milan and the Simplon, or if he retraces his steps by Mont Cenis, he is so full of what he has seen in the classical parts of Italy, that Turin is again disregarded, and he passes through it with the same listless indif ference as before. For my part, having visited this city repeatedly, and remained some time in it, I have learned to appreciate it, and I consider"], [355, "SaUARES AND ARCADES IN TURIN. 17 Turin as a very interesting place, equal in point of situation to any inland town of Italy, and a most comfortable residence for a stranger. It is called II giojello deW Italia ; and is, upon the whole, the best built city in that country, the greatest part of it being on a regular plan. The streets are broad, straight, and intersect each other at right angles. The two principal squares, Piazza Castello, and Piazza San Carlo, are magnificent ; and the fine lofty arcades around them, and those along the Strada Po, afford great convenience in bad weather. There every day after twelve you meet the fashionable part of the population, walk ing up and down ; there you find the best shops, coffee-houses, inns, and restaurateurs ; and after crossing in this manner the principal part of the town, on arriving at the end of the Strada Po, you see at once the river, the noble bridge over it, the verdant hills on the other side covered with country houses, and their highest point crowned with the splendid church of Superga. The situation of Turin is extremely pleasant, and the landscape round it bold and varied. The city is built on the left or western bank of the Po, in a beautiful plain, bounded on the north and west by the Alps, at the distance of fifteen or twenty miles ; to the south it opens into the fertile province of Saluzzo ; and to the east the view is VOL.

Passing the bridge over the Po, you ascend to the church and convent of La Madonna del Monte ; and from the terrace in front of it, you see to the greatest advantage the whole amphitheatre I have mentioned. The city of Turin is laid before you as on a map ; it is small, but elegant and neat; and the country around is well cultivated. You trace the course of that noble river the Po, which takes its source from the glaciers of Mont Viso, the highest and boldest peak of the chain which divides Piedmont from Dauphin6 ; then turning to the north, the sight is bounded by the for midable mass of Alps which divides Switzerland from Italy. You easily distinguish the hoary summits of Monte Rosa, the highest mountain in Europe next to Mont Blanc, rising proudly above the rest. It is a scene indeed worthy of admira tion ; such a variety of yellow plains, green hills, dark woody mountains, and white icy peaks : you follow nature through all her gradations, from the banks of the Po, to inaccessible regions beyond the clouds, from the heart of genial summer to the depth of eternal deathlike winter; here are seen united the wild boldness of the Swiss, with the"], [357, "19 THEATRE CARIGNANO. softer feature of the Italian, landscape; the whole enhanced by a warm sun and brilliant sky. The sight of this magnificent panorama put me in mind of a circumstance which happened here a few years ago, when the French ruled this country. A ge neral of that nation, accompanied by his valet de chambre (the latter a true Parisian), arrived at Turin in the dead of night, and went to lodge with a friend, who resided on the hill beyond the Po. Next morning La Fleur gets up, throws open the windows of the apartment, rubs his eyes, and sees before him the plain of Turin, the city, the Po, and the Alps: Que c'est beau! cela res semble au Pare de V Empereur, cried out the asto nished Parisian, intending a compliment to the lovely and sublime country spread before his eyes. But to return to Turin ; in the evening I went to the theatre Carignano, situated opposite the palace of this name. It is here that operas are performed during a great part of the year; the grand theatre being only open during Carnival. The theatre Carignano is small but neat; the sub ject of the opera was \" Messer Gianni,\" taken from the French of \" Jean de Paris.\" It is now the predominating taste in Italy to borrow their dramas and comedies from the French, English, and Germans; instead of choosing Italian ones. c2"], [358, "20 CHURCH OF SUPERGA. This is another instance of the want of national spirit. On the 8th September, being the day of the nativity of the Virgin, in whose honour and under whose title the church of Superga was built, high mass was performed in that church, at which the court attended. On this day the population of Turin, and of the neighbouring country, flock to that sanctuary. The church is built on the summit of a very steep hill, about four miles to the north east of Turin. I descended the Po in a boat for about two miles, and landing at the foot of the hill, began to ascend by a rugged path. Numbers of pedestrians, citizens and rustics, men and women, crowded along the way. They were all in their best dresses, jogging merrily on ; an air of liveliness and contentment shining on their coun tenances : the clear brown complexions of the females were flushed by exertion and the heat of the weather \u2014 it was a real Italian holiday. In little more than an hour I arrived at the summit, and proceeded to the church. It is a neat and elegant temple, with a fine portico in front, and crowned by a lofty dome ; the interior of the church is cased with rich marbles, and the whole is far superior to any of the churches in Turin. It was built in consequence of a vow made by"], [359, "FESTIVAL OF THE NATIVITY. 21 Victor Amadeus, on the eve of the memorable battle won by Prince Eugene over the French, who were besieging Turin, in September, 1706. The tombs of the kings of Sardinia are in the vaults underneath. When I entered the church, high mass was being performed, at the end of which, a statue of the Virgin, covered with a gaudy dress, was carried round in procession. The King and the Queen followed, escorted by their officers. The music was fine, and the whole ceremony was gone through with much decorum and solemnity. The people seemed to feel real respect and devotion ; and after all that has been said against the intro duction of images, and the forms of Catholic wor ship, it may be doubted much whether southern nations, who are by nature more sensual and less metaphysical than those of the north, could do \u25a0well without those emblems that strike the senses, and thence find a way to the heart. I visited the adjoining cloisters, an extensive and well planned building, from the windows of which I enjoyed a most splendid view, far more extensive than that of La Madonna del Monte, although perhaps less interesting on account of the diminu tive appearance of the distant objects, owing to the greater elevation. From the north-east side of the building I had a view of the plains of Lom bardy, and I was told that in very clear weather"], [360, "22 VIEW FROM SUPERGA. the spire of the cathedral of Milan is to be seen. More to the right, the hills of Montferrat, covered with vineyards, closed the view. The south-east prospect ranges over the plains of Alessandria, as far as the distant Apennines of Genoa. From the corridor on the south-west, I saw the fine plains of Saluzzo and the western Alps, with the peak of Mont Viso overtopping them ; and, nearer, the city and plain of Turin. To the north-west, I observed that remarkable opening in the mountains which leads to the valley of Susa; and farther to the right, the colossal chain of the Swiss Alps appeared like a massy wall, the summit of which was lost in the clouds. This view is somewhat of the same character as that from the Duomo of Milan, and the two together furnish a pretty accurate idea of the immense plain watered by the Po. A little below the church, on a small flat, there is an inn, 'where the joyous peasantry repaired after their devotions, to refresh themselves and enjoy the rest of the day. Temporary sheds were placed round, under which all parties sat indiscriminately at table, eating and drinking, talking and laugh ing. Others were spread in groups about the neighbouring meadows, and were busied in cooking the victuals they had brought with them, by a fire of twigs and leaves hastily collected. Parties of strolling musicians went about, receiving as"], [361, "MONFERINA. 23 their fee a share of the collation. After their frugal repast, the junior part of the assembly col lected themselves in various clusters, and began dancing their national monferina or rather mon ferratina, (from monferrato), a lively kind of country dance. All this scene was so animated, so pastoral, and so full of innocent and genuine gaiety, that I felt its influence operating powerfully upon me. A pure atmosphere, a fine country, a mag nificent view ; surely this is happiness, if happiness can be found on earth. These people are naturally good and generous ; no malignant passions, no splenetic vapours, were to be traced on their fea tures. Italy, with all her evils, is still a happy country. Let peace be granted to her, and nature is so bountiful as to make her quickly recover from all her losses ; and then her contented children may laugh at all the wild reveries of discontented phi losophers, who pretend to better their condition by persuading them that they are unhappy, and thus depriving them of their peace and tranquillity. I had seen the great theatre of Turin on a for mer occasion, and found it one of the finest in Italy ; it ranks after San Carlo of Naples and the Scala of Milan. The entrance to it is under the arcades at the eastern end of the Piazza Castello, close by the Strada Po. The interior is rather gloomy, owing to the appearance of the ornaments, the"], [362, "24 GREAT THEATRE OF TURIN. faded gilding, and also to a scarcity of light, there being no chandelier in the middle ; this darkness, however, favours the effect of music, and I felt more delighted in it than in the dazzling brilliancy of San Carlo. A fault in Italian theatres is that of the pit being quite flat, by which persons behind are deprived of the sight of the stage. This, how ever, serves to leave room for the lower order of boxes. I saw at the grand theatre of Turin a greater display of female beauty, than I expected from the general appearance of the sex in the public walks. The Piedmontese ladies are rather fair ; they have generally a delicate and pale complexion ; they are tall and well made ; their features perhaps have not that regularity of contour to be found in more southern regions, but they have a softness of ex pression, a certain languor and pensiveness in their looks, and an air of benevolence and openness, which are peculiarly interesting. The men are a stout race, tall and well made, and fairer than other Italians. In some of the valleys of the Alps, and particularly in the Val d' Aosta, there are cretins with very large goitres, or swellings in their necks, similar to those who are met with in the valleys of Switzerland on the other side of the Alps. The whole appearance of Turin, and of its inha bitants, is rather solemn and sad ; the regularity of"], [363, "25 MANNERS OF THE TIEDMONTESE. the buildings, the width of the streets, the quietness that reigns in them \u2014 every thing inspires a degree of melancholy, more pleasing, perhaps, than the bustle and confusion of Naples, or. the dissipation of Milan. The manners of the better sort of the Piedmontese are genteel and dignified ; there is much solidity in their character ; they are sensible and studious ; magnificent and rather ostentatious in their taste, and fond of good living. The lower classes are cheerful, open, and industrious. There is an appearance of ease and comfort in the looks of the Piedmontese peasantry, which is not to be found any where south of the Apennines ; except, perhaps, in Tuscany. The females of the lower classes are fond of show in their ornaments. They wear neck laces of large beads of gold in five or six rows ; they have a peculiar kind of high cap of white muslin, somewhat resembling in shape the helmet of a cavalry soldier. The bourgeoises of Turin dress in coloured gowns, black silk aprons, and caps, quite a la Francaise. This class of females, consisting in Turin of shopkeepers' wives and daughters, milliners, and dressmakers, are very free in their manners and address, and have a good deal of French coquetry about them. The Pied montese ladies dress generally after the French fashion, but of late many have adopted the Eng lish style."], [364, "26 PRODUCE OF PIEDMONT. The Piedmontese landholders are generally rich, estates being very productive in this country. Piedmont is one of the most fertile regions of Europe. Its plains afford abundance of corn and rice, of fruits, and vegetables of all kinds ; and the cultivation of the mulberry-tree, for the nou rishment of the silkworms, is the source of an im portant branch of commerce. The silks of Pied mont are superior to those of Naples. The system of irrigation, by canals and sluices from the nu merous rivers which cross the plains of Piedmont, adds greatly to their fertility. The hills of Mon ferrato and Asti are covered with vineyards which yield various kinds of excellent wines, consumed in the country, and little known out of it. A rich proprietor of Asti made lately a trial by sending some of the wine of his own growth by sea to Lisbon, whence it returned much improved ; which shows that the fault attributed to Italian wines in general, of being unable to bear a sea voyage, is not applicable to those of Piedmont. The beautiful valleys, which branch in several directions from the plain to the very foot of the Alps, are rich in pastures, and the cattle reared in them are the finest in Italy ; numbers of them are sent to the Genoese territories. This is, however, the country which a French writer described lately as un pays sterile et peu favorise de la nature. The Pied-"], [365, "27 HOSPITALITY OF THE PIEDMONTESE. fnontese gazette contented itself with remarking, that it was a pity the French had not made this discovery while they were masters of the country, for then they would not have loaded it so unmer cifully with taxes. The Piedmontese are rather fond of gambling ; they have a national game called tarrocco, in which a peculiar set of cards are used. The bil liard rooms are much frequented. The Piedmon tese gentry, especially those in the country, are hospitable, sociable, and fond of strangers. Since the peace, however, some adventurers having found their way to this rich country thought it well to lay it under contribution. They assumed names, and pretensions to rank ; had a ready tale of some accident having happened to them on the road, and contrived to live for some time a discretion, and to get credit for clothes and other objects ; after which, they thought proper to take French leave of their Piedmontese friends. One of those worthies, a native of the Ionian Islands, succeeded in getting introduced to several persons of rank, natives and foreigners, and to sit at their tables. This, however, is easier in Italy than in other countries, on account of the familiarity of manners and of the little formality and reference required to make a new acquaintance ; and it shows that there is much less diffidence in the Italian character"], [366, "28 MORALS OF TURIN. than foreigners are apt to suppose. You make the acquaintance of an Italian in a coffee-house, or in the diligence, and if he is satisfied with your outward appearance and manners, he will imme diately invite you to his house and introduce you to his relations and acquaintance. This confidence has, however, decreased, like many other pleasing traits of national character, since the late wars. The state of morals at Turin is not so loose as at Milan, Venice, or Naples. The good example and strict regularity of the court keep the upper classes at least within the bounds of outward de corum and decency. Young ladies are brought up very strictly, either in nunneries or in their own houses, until the time of their marrying. Gallantry to married women is practised among people of fashion ; but in the other classes it is less frequent, or carried on with more caution and secrecy. I think one of the reasons which renders this evil so common in the upper classes, is the little attention paid to the inclinations, tastes, and sympathies of the parties, in matrimonial alliances. Young blooming girls are often bestowed in marriage on old invalids, or worn-out rakes, who have no other recommendation but their rank and fortune : such preposterous connexions cannot be happy ; nature has its rights, which all the contrivances of men cannot destroy. In proposing a marriage to the"], [367, "29 RELIGION. relations of a young lady, the first things settled are, her portion, pin money, carriage, opera box, number of servants, house in town, villa in the country , and other items ; the least important part of the whole is to know, what kind of education the girl has received, what her dispositions and tastes are ; and scarcely any attention is paid to her senti ments towards her future husband. The Piedmontese profess the Roman Catholic religion, with the exception of a little district in the Alps, called the valleys of Luzerne, the popu lation of which is Protestant ; and who, although in former times they were persecuted, are now protected, and enjoy the free exercise of their worship. Religious ideas, although neglected by the young men of the cities, still preserve their power on a great mass of the population. The solemnities of the church always attract great crowds ; and as the court and elder part of the nobility are strictly religious, they oblige the young fashionables to follow their example, at least in appearance. I think the Italian character na turally inclined to religion, on account of its dis position to melancholy : passionate feelings and enthusiastic devotion spring from the same source. In a former visit to Italy, I happened to be at Turin, in the early part of 1817. The winter had been very distressing to the poor in the north of"], [368, "30 FEELING OF RESIGNATION. Italy. The badness of the harvest and vintage of the preceding year, the dearth and misery which was the consequence, the rigour of the winter, and the epidemic diseases which followed, rendered the appearance of Turin exceedingly gloomy. At every third or fourth door I saw the insignia of death ; I met funerals in every street ; and to add to the general calamity, a drought of three months had parched up the earth and filled the atmosphere with malignant vapours. Public prayers were put up to implore the Almighty to send rain, and restore health to the afflicted people. Ladies of the first rank followed the processions in mourn- ing ; these scenes were impressive and affecting. The idea of death had become familiar to the in- habitants ; even young women spoke of it without terror, saying, with a sad but calm resignation, \" Our next-door neighbour is just dead; next week, perhaps, it will be my turn ; I hope I shall see you once more before that.\" As I was one night walking through the street of Dora Grossa, I saw a number of torches lighted, and many people assembled ; I approached ; about twenty little girls dressed in black with white veils thrown over their heads, and wax tapers in their hands, were standing in two ranks before a house, some whispering, others laughing with childish simplicity. All at once a priest came out of"], [369, "ROYAL PALACE AND CHAPEL. 31 the house; a bier followed, carried by two men; the tapers were lighted, the greatest silence pre vailing amongst the spectators ; the first verse of the psalm Laudate pueri Domimim, was chanted by the priest, and answered in chorus by the attend ants, and thus the procession moved slowly on to wards the grave. It was a young girl who had left the world before she could regret it. The royal palace at Turin is a good building, forming one of the angles of the Piazza Castello ; the court seldom resides in it, but spends the greatest part of the year at the royal seats in the country or at Genoa. It contains a choice collec tion of paintings. There are gardens annexed to the palace, which are open to the public during the summer. I went from the palace, through a passage, into the royal chapel del S. Sudario, which forms part of the cathedral. This chapel is so called from a relic it is said to contain, namely, the sheet in which the body of our Saviour was wrap ped. The inside of the chapel is lined with black marble brought from the mountains of Chablais. The solemn gloom of the place harmonized with the impressive chant of psalms, and the swelling peals of the organ, in the church below. Of the buildings at Turin, little can be said in favour of their architecture, if examined singly ; although the general effect produced by a whole line"], [370, "32 CHURCHES. of streets is imposing. The principal churches are, the cathedral of S. Gio. Battista, la Consolata, S: Filippo Neri, and II Corpus Domini. The two architects employed in these buildings were, Guarini and Giuvara. The former is particularly remarkable for his fondness for crooked lines, useless ornaments, and irregularity of style, of which the palace of Carignan is a spe cimen. The old castle, which stands in the middle of Piazza Castello, has a fine front facing the street of Dora Grossa. The other sides of it are in a ruinous state ; the old towers present an odd con trast with the modern appearance of the build ings and arcades round the square ; the effect they produce is peculiarly striking by moonlight. It was the intention of the late government to have razed this castle, but I think it would have made the square appear monotonous and dismal, unless they had planted a garden in the centre of it : this, however, is neither a French nor an Italian fashion. The streets of Turin are washed every night by the water of the Dora, which is let out through sluices for the purpose. The environs of Turin abound in fine walks. One of the pleasantest is that which leads to the Valentin, a pleasure-house of the king on the bank of the Po. The principal country residences of the court, and which deserve to be visited by tra-"], [371, "33 UNIVERSITY AND ACADEMY. vellers, are, Stupinigi, Rivoli, La Veneria, and La Villa della Regina. The last is charmingly situated on the slope of tha hill beyond the bridge of the Po, and contains some good paintings by Carlo Maratti and others. Turin was formerly fortified with ramparts and ditches ; the latter are filled up and the former demolished, so that from almost every part of the town you have a view of the country. The citadel, however, is still remaining ; it stands at the south west end of the town, and is considered of some strength, but certainly could not protect the ca pital from an invading army, and its vicinity to the city might prove fatal to it. The university, situated in Strada Po, has a good library and a collection of a few antiques, dignified by the name of Museum. It possesses, however, one great curiosity, the famous Isaic table of brass, covered with hieroglyphics, sup posed to relate to the astronomical observations of the ancient Egyptians. There are also two mummies, in good preservation, and a very fine an cient Mosaic, found in the Island of Sardinia. Sciences and literature are cultivated at Turin ; this city has produced in modern times many dis tinguished men of letters. The Royal Academy of Sciences is well known to the learned through out Europe Vol. II. D"], [372, "34 LITERATURE. Count Napione has published a Biography of the Piemontesi Illustri.

Very few beggars are to be seen in the streets of Turin ; the police is good, the streets are well lighted at night, and great order and regularity prevail. Travellers arriving at Turin must have their passports signed by the minister for foreign affairs, for which they pay four livres. There is, however, no delay attending this formality, and the persons employed in the different offices are re markably civil. The city of Turin is about a mile and a half in length from Porta Susina to Porta Po, and some what less in its greatest breadth ; it contains about ninety thousand inhabitants. The popula tion has increased since the return of the king ; and Turin, which, under the French, had become a mere provincial town, has regained its splendour. I was rather surprised to see the city of Turin styled in public documents, Ii1 illustrissima cittd di Torino, Contessa di Grugliasco, Signora di"], [373, "35 HOSPITALS. Beinasco ; the latter are two fiefs belonging to her ladyship. Among the philanthropic institutions of Turin, besides the hospitals, that of Le Rosine is the most remarkable ; this is an asylum for orphan girls, who are brought up under the direction of matrons, in such habits of industry, that they almost sup jaort the establishment by the work of their hands. It is truly pleasing on passing under their windows, to hear them singing cheerfully while at work \u2014 their harmonious voices mixing with the noise of the loom and spinning wheel. Passing from this pleasing subject to a very different one, I am sorry to say that the prisons and houses of correction are not always conducted with that spirit of humanity and Christian charity, which ought to preside over all such places. The houses of confinement, throughout Italy, seem in general more calculated to strike terror and despair in the hearts of the wretched victims of distress and corruption, than to recall the misled, and console the repentant. The Ergastolo, at Turin, where a certain class of females are con fined, affords a distressing specimen of this want of feeling. The fate of these unfortunate creatures is already hard enough, without the addition of unnecessary severity and cruelty. They might be truly called the victims of society, and ought not D2"], [374, "36 STATE CF PRISONS. to be treated like felons. This melancholy subject has claims on the attention of the philanthropists and politicians of every civilized country. It is pleasing, however, to be able to state, with regard to prisons, that of late a lady of Turin has devoted herself to promote the improvement of the internal discipline of these establishments, after the example of the philanthropists of other coun tries, and especially of England. Thus a new channel of beneficence has been opened in Italy. The Piedmontese tongue is a dialect of the Italian, in which many corrupt French words have been introduced, and it is difficult to understand it *. It has many nasal diphthongs of the French, as well as their pronunciation of the letter u ; but the construction of the phrases and the etymology of most of the words are Italian. The last syllables are generally dropped, and the accent placed on the preceding one, with a lengthened drawl, as in the words piemonteis, ed instead of casa, vin for vine, bott, &c. Some of the words are completely dis figured, such as nen for nienle, chiel and chilla for egli and ella, &c. Those verbs which in Italian end in are change their termination into an Italian * Mr. Sismondi says the Piedmontese, as well as the Pro vencal, Languedocian, and Catalan, arc derived from the extinct language of the Troubadours, or Langue d'Oc. I have myself remarked that natives of Languedoc understood the Piedmontese dialect with great facility."], [375, "37 PIEDMONTESE LANGUAGE. c accented, as andc, mangie, &c, and the first person plural of the present indicative termi nates in uma, as portuma, amuma, auguruma, instead of portiamo, amiamo, auguriamo. Some of the common phrases are almost French, as mi non so pas. A word frequently heard in the streets of Turin is the common salutation ciau, which is a corruption of the word schiavo, or servo. With all its capricious irregularities, the Piedmontese dialect is not unpleasant to the ear, and when 6poken by the better sort of females is remarkably soft, expressive, and truly fascinating. The upper classes pride themselves upon speaking the pure Piedmontese with as much affectation as a Crus- cante displays in the pronunciation of his pretto toscano- The Piedmontese dialect varies in the different provinces. Songs, fables, and other light compositions have been written in Piedmontese, and it is easy to trace in them a common etymology of most of the words with the corresponding Italian. The late king, Victor Emmanuel, who abdicated in 1821, had a marked predilection for the Piedmontese dialect ; he always preferred it when speaking to his confidants and attendants ; he did so, probably, from that strong national spirit which he certainly had. The Italian language is now used in all official documents, in the courts of justice, and in the"], [376, "38 GAZZETTA PIEMONTESE. public acts ; it is the language of the state throughout the King of Sardinia's dominions, even in Savoy, where this regulation has created some dislike. This, however, is not so extraordinary as the practice of the French, who, when they had annexed the half of Italy to the empire, established their language over it. The judges of Italian countries were obliged to write their sentences, and attornies their documents, in French. These were, as one may suppose, most miserable specimens of the French language ; it was Italian turned into French words, and I have been highly amused in reading some of the public acts of that period. Most of the inhabitants of Turin speak French fluently, although with a bad accent, by which they can almost always be known, and which is peculiarly remarkable in the letters j, and ch, the first of which the Piedmontese pronounce like a z, and the second like an s; \u2014 for instance, favais, z'avais; je chantai, zesantai; the diphthong eu is also ano ther stumbling-block ; they generally pronounce it like the French ou, which latter fault they, however, have in common with the other Italians. Many Piedmontese literati, however, write as good French as if they had been born on the other side of the Alps. The daily newspaper of Turin is the Gazzetta Piemontese, which is well written and neatly"], [377, "TEATRO D'ANGENNES. 39 printed; but, like all Italian journals, it is but a short compendium of the French papers ; the editors contribute little of their own towards the entertainment of their readers, and their task is, therefore, not very laborious. The perusal of their short columns appears very uninteresting to persons accustomed to the freedom of English news papers, and to the elaborate and often instructive paragraphs many of these contain. A company of Italian comedians perform at Turin almost every evening throughout the greater part of the year ; the Theatre d'Angennes, in the street of the same name, is allotted to them. I have met, in my different visits to this capital, the two companies Goldoni and Perotti, both respectably composed. Comedy is generally well acted in Italy ; but there are as yet few tragic performers of merit, although I think the nation highly susceptible of improvement in this branch of theatricals. The performance of the Italian comedies is a good school for learning the pronunciation and phrase ology of the language. The Italians in general have become of late very partial to tragedy and comedy, which I think is a good sign of the im provement of their intellectual faculties ; and the attention and interest shown by the audience are very unlike the listless indifference which prevails at the Opera-house."], [378, "40 CHEAPNESS OF PROVISIONS. Living at Turin is remarkably cheap, and pro- visions of all kinds are good. Their beef is the best in Italy ; milk, butter, and cheese, are ex- cellent, which is owing to the rich pastures that cover the lower regions of the Alps. The rivers and lakes furnish plenty of good fish, especially exquisite trout and carp. Poultry and eggs are plentiful, as is also game of every sort. Vegetables grow in great abundance in the well-watered gar- dens in the neighbourhood of Turin. The common wine is rather poor, but the vineyards of Mont- ferrato and Asti furnish generous wines, red and white, which are sold at Turin as cheap as common wine is at Paris. There are many good restaura- teurs at Turin, 'where dinner is to be had a la carte ; besides which there are tables d' hote at the several inns. A custom prevalent here is that of itinerant musicians coming into the room while the company is at dinner ; they play on the guitar and sing ballads or canzoni for a trifling remuneration : some of them sing in good style, with much pathos, very superior to the crialleries of the French stroll- ing musicians, whose songs, as the Italians remark, always end in the tone of ora pro nobis in the litany. Lodgings at the inns, as well as private apart ments, are very reasonable. One of the comforts in which Turin is superior to other Italian towns is"], [379, "41 PIEDMONTESE KITCHEN. that every decent apartment has a fire-place. The floors are, as in the rest of Italy, paved with square tiles, varnished red. There are a number of good coffee-houses, some very large, and where coffee, chocolate, and other refreshments, may be had at very moderate prices. The Piedmontese manner of cooking is very good ; it is a sort of medium between the French and Italian. It is much more agreeable to strangers than that which they meet farther south. Butter is a general ingredient, and oil is banished from the kitchen. The Piedmontese have some dishes pe culiar to themselves ; their polenta, a pudding made of the flour of Indian corn, seasoned with gravy and truffles, or with butter and cheese, is a very whole some and substantial food ; the polenta forms the principal diet of the country people. Truffles are very abundant in this country ; they are different from those of France in colour and flavour ; the inside resembles that of a nutmeg : the Piedmontese cooks use them in most of their dishes. Their sambajon is a mixture of white wine, yolk of eggs, and sugar, beat up together, and poured out hot : a cup of it is very pleasant in cold winter days. There is a peculiar sort of bread which is used in Piedmont only, called grissin ; it is baked in the shape of Jong sticks, about the thickness of the little finger; it is very light and dry, and tastes like biscuit ;"], [380, "42 INDUSTRY. the Piedmontese are very partial to it, and prefer it to their common bread. The currency of Piedmont consists of livres and sous; the livre is nearly one-fifth more than the French franc. There are also small pieces of seven and a half, and eight sous, with fractions of them ; these are very puzzling to strangers. Piedmont has several manufactures of silks, and velvets. It is supplied with woollen cloths by France, and with cotton manufactures by England, through the way of Genoa. Turin has a reputa tion for the construction of good carriages, which, however cannot be a subject of great admiration to Englishmen. The snuff of Turin (a monopoly of government) is remarkably good. An Englishman lately established an iron foundry and a saw mill at Mondovi, which, if encouraged by government, may prove of great service to the country. Upon the whole, the Piedmontese are yearly improving ; they have good notions of cleanliness and comfort, and are fond of good and decent living. They are a rational, well-disposed people ; every real friend of Italy must feel an interest in their welfare ; intrusted as they are with the im portant passes of the Alps, they are likely to make a figure in the future destinies of the Italian peninsula. English travellers at Turin are not looked upon"], [381, "REMARKS. 43 with that envy and animosity, nor with that im pertinent curiosity, which is often shown towards them in other countries ; the court and the upper classes are partial to the British nation, and the rest of the people feel no dislike towards them. Piedmont not being a maritime or manufacturing country, and the mass of the inhabitants being less attached to the French than the Milanese, the national interests and prejudices are not, therefore, at variance with those of England. The above is the result of my observations dur ing my residence in this capital, which, to my taste, is one of the most pleasant of Italy, particularly for persons of quiet habits, as it affords every reasonable indulgence of life, as well as sufficient scope for intellectual pursuits."], [382, "44 CHAPTER II. THE SARDINIAN MONARCHY. The House of Savoy is one of the oldest dynasties of Europe. Its princes had the title of Counts of Savoy as early as the eleventh century ; they assumed afterwards that of Dukes, and became successively sovereigns of Piedmont, of Nice, of Monferrat, and of the Marquisate of Saluces. At last, about a century ago, they obtained posses sion of the island of Sardinia, with the title of kings. Piedmont, however, though only styled a principality, forms the main strength of their monarchy. The princes of the house of Savoy, although ab solute, have in general been distinguished by their virtues, and the mildness of their sway ; several of them have been famous in arms and in politics. Being placed, by the position of their territories, at the entrance of Italy, and between the two colossal powers of France and Austria, they found themselves entangled in all the wars these two nations have waged against each other, during the last four centuries, for the supremacy of Italy."], [383, "POLICY OF THE HOUSE OF SAVOY. 45 The house of Savoy contrived, partly by political skill, and partly by real valour and military abili ties, to secure at almost every treaty of peace, not only the possession of its former territories, but gradual additions to them ; and the result has been, the aggrandizement of the Sardinian mo narchy to its present importance, it being now the second in extent and population, though perhaps the first in real strength, among the Italian states. Piedmont had enjoyed a long peace, when the French revolutionary war broke out; an event which brought upon the house of Savoy the greatest calamities. From the beginning of the French revo lution, the then reigning sovereign of Piedmont, Victor Amadeus III., had found himself placed in the most critical position. Being in danger from his proximity to France, which was then a focus of demo cratic principles ; being, at the same time, closely allied by family connexions with the house of Bour bon, \u2014 whatever course he pursued, danger threat ened him on every side. At last, being informed of the events that had happened at Paris on the 10th of August, 1792, which put an end to the French mo narchy, he acceded to the first coalition of Pilnitz against France, and the French ambassador at Turin left that capital. The immediate consequence was, the loss of Savoy and Nice, the two provinces of the"], [384, "46 FRENCH INVASION. Sardinian states which are most exposed to the attacks of France, being on the wrong side of the mountains. Oneglia and some other districts, which the king of Sardinia possessed in the western Riviera of Genoa, were also occupied by the French, and a warfare was carried on for several years between the latter and the Piedmontese troops, supported by an Austrian auxiliary force, along the whole line of the Alps. The Piedmontese, aided by the na ture of the ground, defended themselves obstinately and bravely, though not always successfully ; they, however, maintained their old military reputation, which they enjoyed above all their Italian brethren. At last, in April, 1796, the battles of Monte notte and Millesimo opened to Bonaparte the passes of the maritime Alps ; he cut off the commu nication between the two allied armies, the Austrian and Piedmontese. The latter left to themselves made still some resistance at Mondovi and Cherasco, but the flood-gates were opened, and the French poured with an irresistible force into the beautiful valleys of Piedmont, which had seen no foreign enemy for nearly a century. It was then that Bonaparte is reported to have spoken those cele brated words: \" Soldats ! voila l'ltalie !\" the meaning of which, however it might at that time be mixed in Napoleon's mind with a share of that romanticism, to which he was somewhat prone in"], [385, "47 PEACE WITH FRANCE. his youth, was taken in its most obvious and mat ter-of-fact sense by his troops. The Austrians had retired into Lombardy, to defend their own territories, and the king of Sar dinia, left to himself, with the enemy at the gates of his capital, made an armistice, which was fol lowed by a treaty of peace, signed in the following month of May ; \u2014 a peace such as it might be ex pected, between an overpowering conqueror and his prostrate enemy. The greatest sacrifices of money and other means, as well as of dignity, were required from the court of Turin ; French troops were put in possession of the principal for tresses of Piedmont ; they had the free pass all over the country, even to the very gates of the capital ; and in the following year (April, 1797), the king, Charles Emmanuel, who had succeeded his father, Victor Amadeus, had the additional humiliation of becoming the forced ally of his enemy, with the con dition that he should furnish the French republicans an auxiliary corps of nine thousand men, to fight against his former allies. At the same time, French agents resided at Turin, watching every motion of the court, inter fering between the government and its subjects, demanding amnesty for conspirators, complaining of and demanding satisfaction for, the insurrections of the Piedmontese peasantry, who hated the"], [386, "48 THE FRENCH OCCUPY TURIN. French military, and often received provocations from the latter such as ng man can forgive. This state of things was too unnatural to last long. The court of Turin must have detested the French government, and the French govern ment knew it. Bonaparte had left Europe for Egypt, and the French Directory, on the eve of a second war with Austria, then assisted by Russia, did not think it prudent to leave its armies in Lom bardy, exposed to an enemy, however weak, in the rear. The Directory might have spoken candidly ; its reasons \"were politically plausible, but the Di rectorial Government had not even that sort of bold outward frankness in injustice, which its successor, Bonaparte, often showed. Pretences were fabricated, and a puerile report got up under the shape of a message from the Directory to the Legislative Body, dated 14th December, 1798, in which the coarsest invectives* were mixed with the weakest arguments against the Piedmontese Go vernment. But when the message was delivered, the Piedmontese government had already ceased to exist. The French General Joubert had occu pied Turin on the 7th of the same month, and on the 9th, the King, Charles Emmanuel, signed an * Among the rest, the Duke of Aosta, the king's brother, was designated in this official document, as a monster, and as another old man of the mountain."], [387, "PIEDMONT ANNEXED TO FRANCE. 49 act by which he resigned the exercise of his autho rity over his continental dominions, and set off that same night from his capital to embark for the Island of Sardinia. Piedmont was then taken military possession of by the French. Next year (1799), it was recon quered by the Austro-Russians ; but a twelve-month after, the battle of Marengo, fought in the Pied montese plains, decided the fate of the North of Italy, and the French resumed possession of Pied mont. Partial insurrections took place in several districts among the peasantry, but ended in the sacrifice of the insurgents. In June, 1802, Charles Emmanuel abdicated his sovereignty of Sardinia, and his claim to his con tinental states, to his brother, Victor Emmanuel ; after which he continued to live in a sort of reli gious retirement, first at Florence and then at Rome, where he died a few years ago. In the month of September, 1802, the first Consul Bonaparte annexed Piedmont to the French empire. Nice and Savoy had been incorjDorated long before. Piedmont was divided into six de partments ; Eridano, Dora, Sesia, Marengo, Tanaro, and Stura. A Governor-general was placed at Turin to superintend all the French de partments beyond the Alps. Since that epoch, until the fall of the Emperor Napoleon, in 1814, Vol. II. E"], [388, "50 RETURN OF KINO VICTOR EMMANUEL. Piedmont was lost in the French empire, and its name almost forgotten. The French laws, the French manners, the French language, the French conscription, the French system of taxation, were adopted. The frontiers between the French empire and the so-called kingdom of Italy were marked by the rivers Sesia and Po in the very heart of Italy. Meantime, Victor Emmanuel had retired first to Rome, and afterwards he withdrew himself to Gaeta, from whence he embarked for Sardinia in 1806, when the French troops invaded the king dom of Naples. From that time he resided at Cagliari, the capital of Sardinia, where he kept a shadow of a court. When at last, in 1814, the allies entered Pied mont, Victor Emmanuel was recalled to the throne of his ancestors. He entered his capital in May, 1814, and was received by the great majority of his subjects with unequivocal demonstrations of satisfaction. At the return of Bonaparte from Elba, the king of Sardinia took part in the war against France, and his troops invaded Dauphine and took Grenoble. At the congress of Vienna, to the territories of the Sardinian monarchy, including the province of Novara, was added the Duchy of Genoa, a mag nificent and most important accession. Victor Emmanuel was an upright and well-"], [389, "CHARACTER OF VICTOR EMMANUEL. 51 intentioned man, fond of his subjects, strongly na tional in his feelings, and jealous of the honour and independence of his country; plain and affable in his manners, of an easy access, benevolent, regular, and religious without bigotry. He was also person ally brave and attached to the military profession ; he was often seen drilling himself his officers in the gardens of the palace ; he was active, labo rious, a good equestrian, simple in his manners and style of living. In ordinary times he would have made an excellent sovereign, but he came to the throne after Piedmont had been for fifteen years under the French sway ; he found parties and interests at variance with each other ; an expensive ally, the Austrians, 6till occupying his fortresses ; a troublesome neighbour, the French, at his doors ; the exchequer empty, the country drained, and the crown of Sardinia, although with an addition of territory, much reduced from the importance it had assumed during the last century. Yet, with all these disadvantages, he contrived, during the seven years of his administration, to re-establish order and regularity at home, \u2014 to make his country re spected abroad ; the Austrian troops evacuated his territory ; new fortifications were erected on the passes of the Alps, and at Genoa; a new and fine army was raised ; a navy created, which caused the Sardinian flag to be respected ; roads constructed ; E2"], [390, "52 COURT OF TURIN. public buildings erected, and the finances were put again in order. The only fault that was found in the late Victor Emmanuel, was his excessive goodness and conscientiousness, which made him afraid of taking a determination without listening to the advices of others. I have often met the good Victor Emmanuel walking under the arcades of Strada Po, with a single attendant, mixed with the crowd of his sub jects, whose salutations he returned in a most affable, though becoming manner. There was an air of dignified simplicity, of decorum and regu larity about the royal family, which could not fail to impress the people with a sense of esteem and respect ; and in spite of the sneers of a few, the Piedmontese in general, and the people of Turin in particular, were attached to their sovereign. Eco nomy and regularity, carried almost to monotony, were the standing orders of the royal household. Scandal, which is so busy in courts, was mute about that of Turin. The queen, Maria Theresa of Austria, was amiable, elegant, and dignified, pos sessed of abilities and information; she sjjoke Italian, German, and French equally well, and her family, consisting only of daughters, was pecu liarly interesting. The Duke of Genevois, the present king, is mar ried to Maria Christina, daughter of the king of"], [391, "SARDINIAN GOVERNMENT! 53 Naples, who is highly commended for her good ness and charitable disposition. The Salic law being in force here as well as in France, the crown will devolve to the Prince of Carignano, a cousin of the reigning king, and who has married the daughter of the Grand Duke of Tuscany. The morality and decorum of the court of Sar dinia were certainly different from the conduct of most of the French governors who were sent to rule the foreign dependencies of the empire. The government of the Sardinian states is an absolute monarchy ; and the ancient laws and system of administration were re-established at the restoration, perhaps with too great exactitude, on the same basis on which they stood before the French invasion. On this point, therefore, the people have lost by the change ; as the French civil and criminal codes, with all their imperfections, were certainly preferable, and more adapted to the present state of the human mind ; for which reason they have wisely been preserved in most other Italian states. There are several regulations in the present Sardinian code of laws which are par ticularly complained of, and I will briefly mention some of them. The subjects of the King of Sar dinia are, in a certain manner, attached to the soil ; no one can quit the country or sell his immoveable property without the permission of government."], [392, "54 CODE OF LAWS. By the present code there is, in several instances, a marked difference between the penalties ap plicable to the nobility, and those applicable to the other classes, in cases of the same nature. The administration of justice is left, in a great measure, to the discretion of individuals, however respect able, and rests too much upon their probity \u2014 a dangerous trust for all parties. Another vice which prevails also in almost every state of Italy, is the indefinite procrastination in law suits, and also in criminal processes, by which a man is some times kept long in prison before his fate is decided. In reading over the regulations for the civil and criminal administration of justice in the states of his Sardinian Majesty, published in 1815, after the restoration, one cannot help observing that the views of the compilers have been to protect as much as possible individuals from injustice and oppression. Punishments are laid out for every abuse of power from the magistrate, the gradations of guilt in culprits are scrupulously determined ; but yet the original principles in the establishment of the courts and in the manner of conducting the proceedings is faulty, for it trusts too much to men, over whom, in a country where the press is not free, the law has not a sufficient controul ; therefore all the conscientious intentions of the legislator may be easily frustrated* In several"], [393, "55 ARBITRARY ACTS. chapters, however, of these regulations, is seen an improvement upon former practices ; for instance, in the examination of prisoners, not only there is no longer the question, but the magistrates are strictly forbidden to threaten the accused, or to insinuate promises of forgiveness to obtain his con fession. Persons brought to trial choose their own counsel, besides the Avvocato de' poveri, who is de jure their defender. In many other chapters of these regulations one sees great approximations to sound principles, formerly unknown. The cri minal code is, however, too severe; punishments are not always proportioned to offences, which is a fault common to most other countries. Two other great subjects of complaint in Pied mont, after the restoration, were the salvo condotti and biglietti regj. The former were protections given by the king to persons hard pressed for debts, and which secured them against the prosecutions of their creditors for a certain period. The bigli etti were orders also emanating from government, by which several noblemen have been authorized to take possession of their estates which had been sold during the political changes, on paying the original sum disbursed by those who had purchased them. These arbitrary acts appear so extraordi nary that they require some explanation. The following is the result of the inquiries I have made"], [394, "56 ARBITRARY ACTS. on the subject. During the first French invasion, many of the nobility who were attached to their ancient government, were either arbitrarily de prived of their property, or submitted to heavy contributions ; to pay which they were obliged to borrow money at an exorbitant interest, and to mortgage or even to sell their estates, and, in short, to submit to all the wrongs imposed on them by their merciless rulers. On the return of the king, they stated the grievances they had suffered; many cases of flagrant oppression were made out ; it was proved that many of the acquirers of national property had come in possession of it unlawfully, or paid but a very trifling part of the value ; upon which, the only means government could devise of arranging matters, in such a chaos of conflicting interests, was to adopt the system of issuing salvo condotti and biglietti, which might compensate in part the faithful adherents of their sovereign for their losses. This was, in many instances, punishing injustice in a summary and irregular manner; an arbitrary, but not always an unjust retribution, si milar to those peremptory decisions we find so much praised in the history of the Caliphs, and other an cient monarchs renowned for wisdom. This practice may have led to abuses ; the king's conscience may at times have been misled and his power misused in the service of undeserving people ; but it ought to"], [395, "PIEDMONTESE MINISTRY. 57 be remembered, that the King of Sardinia, on re turning into his dominions, was obliged, both by policy and gratitude, to do something for those who had suffered in his cause, and he could only do it at the expense of the persons who had pro fited in an unprincipled manner at the overthrow of the ancient government, and who had shared with the invaders the plunder of the country: it was at worst but paying them in their own coin. These obnoxious concessions seem, however, at present, laid aside. The ministry was composed of men of abilities : the minister for foreign affairs, Marquis St. Marsan, well known in the diplomatic world for the missions in which he has been employed; the minister of finances, Marquis Brignole, a Genoese nobleman, well acquainted with financial affairs; Count de Balbo was intrusted with the portfolio of the interior, and he superintended also the im portant department of the public studies and edu cation ; \u2014 a man highly respected for his abilities, integrity, and amiable qualities. His nomination to the high post he occupied did great credit to the sovereign, and was a subject of satisfaction to all honest men. The merchants complained that little attention was paid by government to the commerce of the country, and that the duties upon importation and"], [396, "58 POLITICAL PARTIES. exportation were not laid on in such a manner as to encourage national industry ; this subject does not appear to be settled yet, as alterations con tinue to be made in this department. The present government has had plenty of business on their hands since the restoration, and it went slowly to work for several years. With regard to their political opinions, the Piedmontese, as well as the other Italians, were, after the restoration, divided into two parties. The great body of the nobility were attached to the existing government by principle and by inter est, and the peasantry by habit and religion. In the middle classes, and especially among the junior part of them, there were many dissatisfied spirits, who, however, had not made up their minds as to what they wished for, though they entertained a vague notion that something was wrong, but would have been much at a loss to have explained how it was to be mended. Piedmont had not had, like Lombardy, even a shadow of indepen dence under the French, nor any sort of national representation ; it was merely a province of the French empire. Several of the discontented people were, therefore, regretting the French system, and this for many reasons. Interest was one : many of them held lucrative employments, either civil or military, under the late government,"], [397, "59 TIEDMONT AND LOMBARDY COMPARED. which they lost by the restoration. Besides, the late system, which was not remarkably strict on religious or moral points, was more analagous to the taste of many, especially young men ; ambition and vanity had a great share in their predi lection for the French government ; they were flattered by the idea of forming part of a great nation ; they were dazzled by its military glory ; their enthusiasm and passions had taken this bias, and they felt their disappointment severely. Under the French, also, the career of dignities and lucrative employments was more generally open to all ranks. I have heard some Milanese make an appropriate remark on this subject to their Piedmontese friends : comparing the present situa tions of their respective countries, they observed, thai, the Piedmontese have at least an Italian sovereign and court ; that they rank as an inde pendent state ; that the taxes they pay are spent in the country, and circulate to its profit ; that civil and military situations are all filled by natives, and, in short, that the fate of their country is much preferable to that of Lombardy, reduced to the condition of a distant province of a foreign em pire. The justness of these reflections must strike every dispassionate mind. There was, however, another class of men who wished to unite the whole of"], [398, "60 PIEDMONTESE ARMY. the north of Italy under one government, an enter prise much beyond their powers. But of them anon. The military forces of the King of Sardinia were in a very respectable condition. Part of them were formed into a standing army, in which sol diers were enlisted voluntarily, either for a certain period or for life ; the guards, the cavalry, the artillery, the royal regiments, and several regiments of cacciatori, or light troops, belonged to this class. The other, and the most numerous part of the army, was formed of provincial regiments, raised by conscription ; the soldiers composing them were classed in three divisions, one of which alone was under arms at a time, while the rest re mained at home, and they relieved each other every eight months, so that in the course of two years the whole had performed their duty. This was a great economy to government, as the soldiers off duty received but a trifling allowance out of their pay ; besides which, there was a saving in their dresses, arms, and accoutrements. As it would have been hard to turn away those amongst them who perhaps had no home, or a miserable one to return to, those who wished it were allowed to remain, or to serve in the permanent army. This indulgence was, however, not often required ; aud it must be observed, that the extent of the country"], [399, "61 FIDELITY OF THE PIEDMONTESE. being small, the distance of the different garrisons from the respective homes of the soldiers was but short ; and it was also but a pleasant walk of at most three or four days, through a fine country, to go to and from their houses. By these means, the King of Sardinia had an army of sixty thousand men well disciplined, perfectly well dressed and equipped, and which he could collect at ten days' notice. The provincial regiments were named from their respective pro vinces and towns, such as the regiment Aosta, Saluzzo, Cuneo, Monferrato, Alessandria, Asti, fye. The Piedmontese are good-looking men and good soldiers ; they have enjoyed this reputation for centuries ; the guards are a remarkably fine body of men. It was an old remark, that the servants of the House of Savoy, civil and military, had been always remarkably faithful to their masters. An heroic instance of self-devotion occurred during the siege of Turin, by the French, in 1706. At one time the besiegers were near getting possession of the citadel, when the commander, Count Daun, ordered some mines to be dug under the French trenches and batteries. A Piedmontese soldier, Pietro Micca, was the leader of the miners ; the mine was ready, and nothing remained but to lay the train and set fire to it. While Micca was"], [400, "62 PIETRO MICCA. preparing the train, he heard the report of the workmen of the enemy below him, who had brought their counter-mines so that the earth be gan to sink under his feet. In a few minutes his mine would have been destroyed, before he could finish to prepare his train. Micca, struck with the importance of the work he had been preparing for the defence of the place, ordered his com panions to hasten to leave the mine, requesting them to recommend his family to the beneficence of the sovereign ; he then lighted a match, and as soon as his comrades gave the signal of their being out of the mine, he set fire to the powder, and blew up himself together with the enemy. The injury done to the French works gave time to the Prince Eugene to come to the relief of Turin, and to obtain over the French his memorable vic tory, of which the temple of Superga remains a memorial. At the time I was speaking of, namely, 1819 and 20, the spirit of the Piedmontese troops was con sidered good ; there were known to be the remains of partiality towards Napoleon, in some of the indi viduals who had served under him, but even they were believed to be mostly reconciled to their go vernment, which showed a particular regard for the army. There were, besides, in the Piedmontese army, a good number of old officers, who had"], [401, "63 PIEDMONTESE OFFICERS. always been attached to the king's cause, and who had either followed him in his exile to the island of Sardinia, or entered the ranks of the allied armies and fought under the banners of Russia, Austria, or England. The Russian army had several offi cers of rank who were natives of Piedmont. The greatest part of the Piedmontese officers who had served abroad returned after the peace, and offered their services to their own sovereign, who distinguished them with his favour. There were several colonels of regiments, who served in the foreign corps, in British pay, in different parts of the Mediterranean. Upon the whole, there seemed to be a national spirit and good harmony prevail ing among the officers. There were but few fo reign officers in the service of his Sardinian majesty. Piedmont furnished the greatest part of the King of Sardinia's army. Savoy, Genoa, Nice, and Sardinia sent their respective regiments; but the difference of national character between the natives of these various countries was some obstacle to their good understanding.

The moderate party had evidently obtained the ascendancy ; when the ill-timed insurrection of March, 1821, made every thing retrograde for several years, and"], [403, "65 CONSTITUTION PROCLAIMED. brought again irritation, re-action, and other cala mities, upon a country which wanted but rest to follow a slow but progressive improvement. We will now proceed to facts. The proclamation of the constitution in Spain, followed by that of Naples, was probably thought favourable by those who were advocating a similar system in other parts of the Continent. The Piedmontese Avaited, however, till the Austrian army had marched into South Italy to attack the Neapolitans. In the beginning of March, 1821, several regi ments, forming the garrison of Alessandria, assem bled as if for parade, were harangued by some of the officers, who cried out, \" The Constitution for ever,\" and formed themselves into a deliberative body. Those among the officers who did not ap prove of this novelty, left the place. The regi ment of Savoy, which formed part of the garrison, would take no part in the general movement, although several of their officers made common cause with their brethren of the other regiments ; the body of the Savoyards refused to obey the direc tions of those self-instituted authorities, and deter mined to set off for their native country, there to wait the orders which would emanate from the esta blished government of the kingdom. They set off ac cordingly, by companies and divisions, commanded Vol. II. F"], [404, "66 REGIMENT OF SAVOY. by subaltern or non-commissioned officers, and marched in the most orderly manner through the plains of Piedmont, crossing towns and villages where every thing was in a state of confusion, and where no provisions were made for them; and yet these honest mountaineers did not commit a single act of depredation. They reached at last the mountains of Savoy, where they found the autho- rities of that state still acknowledging the king's government, and the regiment of Savoy placed themselves at their disposal. The conduct of these men, natives of a country which was thought to be one of the least affected to the court of Turin, forms a striking trait in the history of those trans- actions, and it gained the esteem of men of all parties. Meantime, the rest of the garrison of Alessandria, joined by civilians who had assembled from various parts, established a provisional junta of government. While this was passing at Alessandria, the students of the university of Turin, being joined by some other individuals, among whom, I was assured, were many foreigners of various na tions, showed the first symptoms of insurrection in the capital ; they assembled in the square, crying out, \" The Constitution for ever !\" Being dispersed at first by the troops, they went out of the capi tal, and took the road to Alessandria. The events, however, which had happened in the latter place"], [405, "67 MOVEMENTS AT TURIN. Decoming known at Turin, new assemblements took place, and men of some influence began to appear favourable to the cause. A deputation was sent by them to the Prince of Carignano, the presumptive heir to the throne, to state to him the wishes of the people, with regard to the establish ment of a constitution. The prince replied, he could not act without the instructions of his sove reign. Seeing, however, the crisis had become serious, he went to the king, and informed him of the state of affairs. The troops in garrison at Turin were wavering. It is said, however, that the king was advised by some of his counsellors, to put himself at the head of some squadrons of ca valry, who could be depended upon, and face the insurgents ; and that had he done so it would have decided the rest of the soldiers in his favour, and the business would have been at an end. Victor Emmanuel, although not deficient in personal cou rage, felt averse to violent measures ; he was, above all, reluctant to excite a civil war among his subjects, whom he really loved ; he was also particularly jealous not to give an opportunity to foreigners to interfere in the affairs of his kingdom. The court, therefore, appeared undecided, and the partisans of innovation now became bolder. Seve ral noblemen and superior officers, men of various civil professions, lawyers, physicians, and mer- F 2"], [406, "victor Emmanuel's abdication. 68 chants, and many officers of the various regiments, assembled and avowed their intention of proclaim ing a constitutional government. The king was requested to give his assent to it. He replied that no compulsion would make him part with his au thority, such as it had been transmitted to him by his ancestors, and which he was bound to deliver over unimpaired to his successors. He might have said, and it would have been a stronger argument, though leading to the same conclusion, that he could not bend to the judgment of some indi viduals, who evidently did not constitute any thing like a majority, either numerical or moral, of the nation ; and that before making any change in the system of government, it was meet to ascertain the real opinion of the people. But Victor Emmanuel had been brought up in other sentiments, to which he conscientiously adhered ; and which could not be expected, at his age, and after all his vicissitudes, to be erased from his mind. He took what he considered to be the only path left to him; he abdicated the crown to his brother and heir, Charles Felix, Duke of Genevois; who was then at Modena, on a visit to his niece, mar ried to the sovereign of that Duchy. Couriers were sent to the new king, informing him of these events. Victor Emmanuel acted the part of an honest,"], [407, "69 his departure. conscientious, though some will say mistaken, prince ; the latter, however, is a matter of opinion. He at least exhibited no tergiversation, no self-interest; but followed what he considered his paramount duty. He was also stung to the quick at seeing his good intentions disregarded and rendered use less ; persons whom he had employed and benefited appeared now arrayed against him ; he foresaw in calculable calamities to his country; and the pro bable interference of Austria, which it had been his object carefully to avoid, now provoked by the rash ness of the reformists. He left his throne without regret for himself, and prepared immediately to depart with his family for Nice, there to embark. Prince Carignano offered to accompany him ; but the king declined it, and told him he ought to remain in the capital in the absence of the new king, and watch over the interests of the state. On the night of the 10th March, Victor Em manuel, his consort and daughter, and a few faith ful servants, left the capital. The mass of the population of Turin had taken no share in these events ; they stood amazed and perplexed; the departure of the king, who was personally loved, threw an additional gloom over the capital. The constitutionalists complained of this coolness of the metropolis. One of them, writing from a provincial town to a friend at"], [408, "70 GIUNTA OF GOVERNMENT. Turin, called it : la vostra gelata capitale, la seria Torino. The constitutionalists now formed a junta, and appointed the members of a new administration ; the Prince of Carignano accepted pro tempore the regency of the kingdom. Considerable discrepancy of opinion existed, however, between the constitu tionalists about their future plans. Piedmont had never had a representative government. Some wanted a moderate constitution, with a house of peers, an hereditary nobility, and important pre rogatives left to the crown ; others, and they were the greater number, declared themselves (and, it may be said, unfortunately for all parties) for the constitution of Spain, which, as it may be sup posed, was little known to the Piedmontese. How ever, the constitution of Spain was proclaimed on the 13th of March, and a number of copies, trans lations, and extracts of it having been printed, were sent and spread about the country. There was also some demur between the junta of Ales sandria and that of Turin; the latter considered themselves as the central government, and re quired the dissolution of the former ; at last those of Alessandria submitted. The answers of King Charles Felix to the com munication of his brother and the junta were anxiously expected; at last a fulminating decree"], [409, "KING CHARLES FELIX'S DECREE. 71 came from Modena, in which, after accepting the crown only pro tempore, and until his brother should resume it, or confirm his abdication, the new king declared the establishment of the junta as unlawful, all its acts void and null, and ordered its members to return to their allegiance under pain of being considered as rebels. He reinstated every thing in the state it \"was in before the insurrection; ordered the old functionaries to resume their duties; and appointed General La Tour, Lieu tenant-General of the kingdom, till his return. The last-mentioned officer, who had taken an active part in the late wars against the French, kept aloof on the present occasion from any par ticipation in the insurrection of Alessandria and Turin. He assembled the garrison of Novara, to which were now joined many officers and men of different corps who did not approve of the deter mination of their comrades, and he communicated to them the orders from Modena, and his determina tion to acknowledge no other authority but that of his lawful sovereign King Charles Felix. The troops professed their fidelity, and that they would abide by him. The regiment of Cuneo was among the most eager in these demonstrations of attachment to the royal cause. The carabineers or gens d'armes, which, in Piedmont as well as in France, form a most effective body, being composed of picked men"], [410, "72 ROYALIST ARMY AT NOVARA. and old soldiers, remained also faithful to the king throughout the kingdom. They would not receive any orders but from their commanding officer. Those of Turin continued to perform the duties of the police of the capital, without taking any share in political demonstrations. By degrees General La Tour collected at Novara about six thousand men, infantry and cavalry, with a considerable train of artillery. He was in that position pro tected in his rear by the Austrian troops, who had began to assemble on the frontiers of Lombardy, under Count Bubna, governor of Milan. When the contents of the despatches from Modena were known at Turin, alarm seized several of the constitutionalists. Some of them were pro- bably disgusted at the turn affairs had taken, seeing the democratic party had carried their object in preference to theirs; others perceived that the change could not now proceed as smoothly, as if either the old or the new king had come to terms. From whatever motive, despondency or repentance, several of the leading characters left Turin. The Prince of Carignano had already given the example. He went off suddenly to Novara, and there put himself under the orders of General La Tour, acknowledging himself a subject of King Charles Felix. The junta, however, remained firm ; the die was"], [411, "73 DIVISION OF PARTIES. cast, and they were determined to make resistance. They declared that they could not consider the orders of Charles Felix as the expression of his real sentiments, while he was out of the kingdom. But their affairs were in a desperate state. The king against them and out of their reach ; a strong royalist army at Novara; Savoy refusing to ac knowledge their authority; the governor and the senate of Chambery preserving their power over that duchy ; several provinces of Piedmont in a state of indecision ; regiments divided in opinion ; and Genoa, which had undergone two or three changes in the course of a few days, seeming half inclined to take advantage of the general confusion to throw off its allegiance to the Piedmontese government, whether royalist or constitutionalist. But, as if to increase their difficulties ten-fold, the constitutionalists had also evinced, from the beginning, a spirit of bitter hostility against the Austrians ; meantime the latter collected their troops on the borders of Piedmont. The Piedmontese spoke of driving the barbarians out of Italy ; they kept correspondence with the disaffected of Lom bardy ; the Austrian minister was insulted by the mob, and left Turin ; in short, a rupture with Austria had become unavoidable. If there was an intention of effecting a movement in Lombardy, simultaneously with that in Piedmont, the plan"], [412, "74 INDECISION OF AFFAIRS. must have miscarried ; but it is more probable that the leaders, as has been the case in all the late revolutions, miscalculated their influence and their means. An Italian was describing these movements as malamente immaginati, peggio ordinati epessi mamente eseguiti. In the beginning of March, letters from Paris were seized at Turin, addressed to some of the principal constitutional leaders, in which their correspondents told them to delay the blow, for it was either too soon or too late. I was assured at Turin, and from good authority, that for several days previous to the breaking out of the insurrection, the police was acquainted with the plot ; but either it did not or would not con sider it of sufficient importance, or the king de precated harsh measures, especially as they affected men who had a name in the country. The month of March passed in this state of sus pense ; \u2014 the junta of Turin endeavouring to gain partisans, and, above all, to collect an effective army, notwithstanding the discouragement pro duced by the news of the events of Naples; and General La Tour strengthening himself at Novara, with regular troops, and, above all, a great body of officers. The provinces and districts, however, remained tolerably quiet, and the mass of the population passive ; and this was perhaps as bad as if part had shown themselves hostile. The only"], [413, "MOVEMENTS OF THE TROOPS. 75 disorders that took place at Turin and at Genoa, were momentary, and, as it appears, the result of accident, by which a few individuals lost their lives ; but there was nothing like deliberate blood shed. At last, on the 4th of April, General La Tour advanced from Novara upon Vercelli with part of his troops. The constitutionalists had assembled the troops they had at Alessandria and Voghera, and concentrated them at Casale, to the number of about three thousand infantry, a thousand cavalry, and six pieces of field artillery, under the command of Colonels Regis and Saint Marsan Caraglio. On the 5th, some interviews took place between the officers of the two armies, to endeavour to con ciliate matters, but they had no result. On the morn ing of the 6th, Colonel Regis marched his troops upon Vercelli. General La Tour evacuated the latter city, and retired beyond the river Sesia. Next day a flag of truce from the royalist camp communicated to Colonel Regis the despatches of the Austrian General Bubna to Count La Tour, in which the former said, that if the constitution alists continued their march towards the frontiers, he would consider it as an act of hostility, and would give orders to the Austrian troops to cross the river Ticino. If, on the contrary, they halted where they were, he would wait the result of the"], [414, "76 ENGAGEMENT AT NOVARA. mediation of Count Mocenigo, Minister of Russia at Turin, who had offered his good services be tween the constitutionalists and the king. The constitutionalists, however, resumed, though slowly, their march upon Novara, and passed the night under the walls of that place. The Austrian troops, from the opposite side, then crossed the frontier, and arrived in the neighbourhood of Novara during the night. On the morning of the 8th, the Austrian sharp shooters began the engagement; a Piedmontese battalion from Novara charged the constitution alists, who, seeing the Austrians had really crossed the frontiers, and hearing that other troops of the same nation were marching by Vigevano upon their rear, began to effect their retreat towards Vercelli. This was done at first in tolerable good order; some of the Austrian cavalry charged the rear guard, which was composed of Piedmontese dragoons, and there some fighting took place. About a hundred men were killed and wounded. Arrived at Vercelli, however, the constitutional troops began to disperse in every direction, and from that moment there was no longer an army. The news of the affair of Novara were brought to Turin, and the junta and the other leaders hastened to leave the place. Thus ended, after thirty days, the insurrection of Piedmont."], [415, "77 RESTORATION OF THE KING'S AUTHORITY. The Austrians marched upon Alessandria, where they entered without opposition, and General La Tour continued his march upon Turin. The students had shut themselves up in the citadel, whence they exacted provisions from the munici pality ; they, however, were soon brought to reason. The rest of the kingdom, Genoa and Nice, returned without any opposition under the royal authority. The constitutionalists, in advancing upon Novara, were in hopes, either that part of General La Tour's corps Avould join them, of which there were some indications at one time, or that the Austrians would not cross the frontiers. Even had they been joined by the troops of Novara, they would not have been able, with about ten thousand men, to oppose the march of twenty thousand Austrians. It was altogether a sad affair, an useless and uncalled-for exposure. The old king, Victor Emmanuel, is said to have expressed himself feelingly about it to some officers, pointing to the national uniform, Est abit tavern un po'' spur ca. \" We have stained a little this coat.\" I visited Turin again in September, 1821. An unusual appearance of gloom was spread over the city. Many families mourned over the conse quences of the late insurrection, and the forced absence of their relatives, who had been obliged to"], [416, "78 EFFECTS OF THE REVOLUTION. expatriate themselves, in consequence of it ; or of others, who, less fortunate, were arrested, and expecting their sentence. A great number of persons had lost their situations, civil or military. It was then that the fatal effects of revolutions were felt, and one could ruminate coolly upon them. The court was absent; the old king, Victor, was at Lucca, with his daughter, who is married to that prince, and the new king, Charles Felix, was still at Modena. The latter returned at last, in October, and published an indulto or amnesty to those not principally implicated in the late affairs. The universities both of Turin and Genoa were closed. The Aus trians garrisoned Alessandria, Casali, Vercelli, and other fortresses ; but Turin and Genoa were left in trust to the Piedmontese troops who had followed General La Tour. Most of the leaders of the Piedmontese revolu tion escaped to Switzerland ; others embarked near Genoa, where the authorities humanely avoided molesting them in their escape. Two or three officers, who began the revolt at Alessandria, were tried and executed ; others were condemned to im prisonment for various periods ; several, being absent, were outlawed, and their property con fiscated. It was remarked, at the time, that, there was more rigour shown against the constitution"], [417, "79 SUBSEQUENT STATE OF AFFAIRS. alists in Piedmont than at Naples, where the Austrian General, Frimont, was supposed to have exerted a beneficial influence. By degrees, however, things in Piedmont have assumed a milder appearance ; the universities have been re-opened, the army re-organized, the Austrians have evacuated the kingdom. A certain degree of confidence has been restored. It is to be hoped, that the measures of government will be such as to make the people forget their past agita tions and misfortunes ; for it depends, in great measure, upon government to render such a coun try as Piedmont, with a population whose general character is decidedly good and estimable, one of the happiest in Europe, and the Sardinian mo narchy the most respected in Italy."], [418, "80 CHAPTER III. PIEDMONT AND GENOA. On leaving Turin, we passed the fine bridge on the Po ; it is of white stone, and was constructed under the French, who, with regard to works of public convenience and splendour, revived in the Italians that taste for magnificent undertakings, which the latter had shown in past ages, but which seemed for many years to have been slumbering in them. The present governments of Italy are encourag ing this renewed disposition ; the plans of the French are being completed, and new ones of im portance laid out. The King of Sardinia is con structing fine roads through different parts of his dominions, especially along the two Riviere of Genoa, where no track of wheels had ever been seen before ; the Pope has cleared out and brought to light again many of the remains of Roman ar chitecture, which adorned the city of the Seven Hills ; the King of Naples continues the excava tions of Pompeii, and the roads in the neighbour hood of his capital ; he has had the theatre of San"], [419, "81 ROAD TO GENOA. Carlo rebuilt, with more than its original magni ficence ; and is now adorning the square in front of his palace with a fine colonnade, in imitation of that of St. Peter's, at Rome. All these are subjects of rejoicing for the lovers of the fine arts. The road to Genoa follows, for some time, the right bank of the Po, until it ascends the steep hill of Moncalieri, whence it strikes off at once in an easterly direction, in which it continues as far- as Alessandria. Moncalieri is a little town remark able only for its fine situation, and its palace be longing to the Kings of Sardinia. The French had made a military hospital of it, and they left it in a ruinous condition ; it has been since repaired, and became the residence of King Victor Emmanuel* after his abdication. From Moncalieri we pro ceeded to Poirino, through a fine jwell-cultivated country. While changing horses at Poirino, we witnessed a squabble between the conductor of our diligence, a Savoyard, and the postilion, a sturdy Piedmontese, about some difference on money mat ters, in which the former called the latter a brigand ; the Piedmontese very coolly threatened to take him before the justice of peace for insulting an honest subject of his majesty, animadverting, at the same time, on the impertinence of the Savoyards, who, he said, come from their .barren mountains to * Since dead, in the beginning of 1824.

Upon the heights of Villanova, we had a last view of that fine range of Alps we had so much admired at Turin. Between Villanova and Asti, the country is hilly, and covered with vineyards. This district, called L'Astigiano, produces the wine known by the name of Asti. There are two sorts of Asti wine, red and white ; the latter is a kind of muscat, having a fine flavour, and sparkling like champaign. Asti is a large well-built place ; there is an air of comfort here, as well as in the other provincial towns of Piedmont; the peasantry have a healthy comfortable appearance, different from the squalid looks of the country people in the south of Italy. Asti is well known as the birth-place of Alfieri, the Italian Sophocles; one of the most distinguished characters of modern Italy. His house is still to be seen near the main street, and his sister now resides in it. The name of Alfieri"], [421, "83 ALFIERI. is endeared to his countrymen for many reasons ; he was passionately fond of his native Italy ; he regretted the state of weakness into which it had fallen, but his discriminating mind soon perceived that no good was to be expected from foreign in- terference, and he well knew how to draw the line between liberty and license : he often re- peated, that he loved liberty, but not French liberty. In his political meditations, his stern mind and fiery temper led him to seek for models among the ancient Romans, whom he resembled in character ; but he found nothing like them in mo dern times. The English were the only foreign nation he esteemed, and he was perhaps the first to hold them out as an example to his astonished countrymen,' and to kindle in them that feeling of admiration which many Italians have since shown for British institutions. His exclamation on first touching the shores of England, expresses in a lively manner the enthusiasm felt by his generous mind : ;t Dopo tanti sospiri, e voti tanti Ti vedo, e calco alfin libera terra Cui son di Francia, e Italia, ignoti i pianti. Qui leggi han regno, e niun le leggi atterra.\" Alfieri may be called the father of the Italian tragedy ; he has imparted to his native lan guage a strength and an energy, of which it was G 2"], [422, "84 ALESSANDRIA DELLA PAGLIA. not deemed susceptible before. Alfieri had his failings, like all the children of men ; but his ge nius, his honest sincerity, and the undaunted firm ness of his character, atone largely for his imper fections, and will secure him a distinguished place in the memory of future generations. From Asti the road follows the course of the river Tanaro as far as Alessandria. On approach ing the latter city, the country opens into a wide plain. We passed by the citadel, which is one of the strongest places in Piedmont ; it communicates with the city by a covered bridge over the Tanaro. Alessandria was regularly fortified: the French enlarged the lines and outworks, so as to make it capable of holding a garrison of sixty thousand men ; they considered it their central position in Piedmont. The Austrians, in their last conquest of Italy, destroyed the fortifications, which had cost enormous sums; but, in truth, it was no great loss to the King of Sardinia, such an extensive for tress being disproportionate to the numbers of his army. There is still, however, a strong garri son stationed in the town and citadel. Alessandria has the gay military appearance of all garrison towns ; it is well built, and has a fine square in the centre planted with trees, which is a rare thing in Italy ; round it there are a number of coffee houses and billiard-rooms, the resort of officers"], [423, "AUSTRIAN TROOPS. 85 during their leisure hours. The diligence from Turin to Genoa stops here for the night; the inns are very good; passports are examined by the military commander. Here we met the first Austrian troops. Their white uniforms peeped just above the citadel. We then met Germans, Croats, Sclavonians, and Hungarians, crowding in the square of Alessandria. They were fine men, well dressed, and appeared per fectly orderly ; we inquired of the people of the inn, a class of persons not very favourable to them in general, how they behaved; \" poor fellows, they behave like saints,\" was the characteristic Italian expression we received in answer; \"they pay for every thing, and are quiet; it is not their fault if they are here.\" Next morning we proceeded on our journey, and passed the Bormida, a river which takes its source near that of the Tanaro, in the Apennines of Mondovi, and which joins the latter river below Alessandria, whence their united streams flow into the Po, a few miles lower down. We entered the celebrated plains of Marengo, where the star of Bonaparte rose and decided the rate of Italy. The country is flat and woody. The road here di vides in two, the one to the left leads to Tortona, Pavia, and Milan; that on the right proceeds to Genoa. The French army advanced from Tortona,"], [424, "86 MARENGO. and after passing the Scrivia, proceeded to the villages of San Giuliano and Marengo: the Aus trians had come out of Alessandria to encounter them. The Austrians fought bravely, and the day seemed lost for the French, when at five in the evening the timely arrival of Dessaix's corps of reserve turned the fate of the battle. Still the Austrian army remained strong, the greater part of its cavalry had not been engaged, and the troops appeared competent to renew the fight ; but the Austrian commander-in-chief, overawed by the critical position in which his army was placed, thought proper on the second day after the battle to sign a convention at Alessandria, by which he gave up the greatest part of Lombardy, and twelve important fortresses, on condition of being allowed to retire unmolested to the Mincio. The battle of Marengo took place on the 14th of June, 1800, and the convention was signed on the 16th. This district is called by the inhabitants La Fragola ; the peasantry of it are represented to be daring and fierce ; they rose en masse against the French on the first invasion of their country, as did also the inhabitants of Carmagnola, Mon dovi, and of other places in the southern part of Piedmont. The Italian peasantry showed in ge nera], every where, a great dislike towards the"], [425, "ITALIAN PEASANTRY. 87 French intruders. Their ideas were unsophisticated by theories, and they reasoned upon facts; they had been for generations contented and quiet in their humble condition; acts of oppression were rare in the country ; they lived comfortably, particularly those of the north of Italy. They were attached to the religion of their fathers ; the corruption of cities had made little progress among them; they were fond of their wives, and jealous of the honour of their daughters. But as soon as the French came, a most dreadful alteration took place. The generals and commissaries extorted money and provisions from the inhabitants, the soldiers seduced or ravished their wives and daughters, and they all joined in insulting their saints, their belief, and the ministers of their re ligion; and if any one dared to remonstrate, he was brought before a military commission and shot on a charge of disaffection and high treason against liberty. This is a short compendium of the be haviour of the republican armies in Italy; no wonder then, that the inhabitants revolted in many places and revenged themselves on their oppressors, committing acts of dreadful retalia tion. Had they succeeded in driving them out of the country, their conduct, like that of the Spaniards, in later times, would have been called heroism; unfortunately for them, they failed, and"], [426, "88 MONDOVI. were looked upon as banditti. Carmagnola, a nice little town to the south of Turin, on the right bank of the Po, was taken and burnt by the French. Mondovi, a large place situated farther south at the foot of the Ligurian Apennines, made a longer resistance. The peasantry of the country around, a stout spirited race, rose, to the number of many thousands, and kept the French at bay for some time ; but the jacobin party in the town, who were in correspondence with the enemy, con trived to distribute to the peasants cartridges made of adulterated powder, so that when they came in contact with the enemy, their fire had no effect, and they were easily defeated and massacred. The invaders then entered Mon dovi, which they partly set on fire, plundering, ravaging, and murdering in every direction. There is still living one of the jacobin leaders, whose wife was the first victim of the fury of the French soldiery; she was shot at, while looking out of a window for her husband, who was coming along with them. After the massacre, these lawless ruffians, joined by all the abandoned characters, male and female, that collected to share the plun der, went to dance pele mele, and committed all kinds of abominations in the sumptuous halls of the fugitive nobility, and this in honour of the goddess of reason."], [427, "89 HORRORS OF THE LATE WARS. Such scenes were not rare in Italy at that time ; and those nations who have had the good fortune to escape the storm will hardly credit the account of these horrors-. A number of people, however, still live who witnessed them, and who relate them to the disgrace of the perpetrators. The details are too horrid for description. In later times, the conduct of the French imperial armies (although better disciplined than their republican prede cessors) in the ravaged regions of Calabria, in the mountains of Tyrol, in the glens of the Sierra d'Estrella, at the taking of Taragona, and amidst the smoking ruins of Moscow, affords such a mass of evidences, that, even allowing much to be exag gerated, there remains enough to stain the memory of the conquerors in the recollection of future ages. Some of their officers have reluctantly con fessed, that the demoralization of the army had reached the highest pitch ; and that, having in dulged it at first, the chiefs had no longer power to restrain it. Courage and abilities cannot atone for such an abuse of them. May the remembrance of these foul deeds serve as a lesson to every nation not to trust, in future, the fair promises of an ambitious conqueror. The plain of Alessandria is bounded on the south by the Genoese Apennines, on the west by the hills of Monserrato, on the north by the Po, and"], [428, "90 SOUTHERN DRESS. it extends to the east along that river towards Voghera. We entered the ancient Genoese terri tory at a place called Pozzolo, and arrived at Novi, a considerable town at the foot of the mountains. Here we felt we were approaching southern Italy, by the alteration in the looks and dress of the people, in their language and man ners, and in the style of building. The flat and broad brimmed hat of the Piedmontese peasant, gives way to the sugar-loaf hat, or to the hanging red cap of the Genoese. A velveteen jacket thrown carelessly over the shoulders, short breeches un buckled at the knee, the neck bare, a red sash round the waist; dark complexions, spare, bony forms, raven hair, the wild penetrating glance of the children of the south, and an appearance of carelessness ; these are the general characteristics of the male peasantry. The heads of the women are uncovered, their hair plaited, powdered, and tied up behind with a riband ; plain calico gowns, a gaudy handkerchief tied across the bosom ; sunny complexions, fine figures, bright eyes, and an indo lent demeanour ; these are the striking features in the appearance of the females. Many of the buildings of Novi give a good idea of the taste and magnificence of the wealthy Genoese, who have palaces in this place. The Genoese style of architecture, and especially the"], [429, "91 NOVI ornamental part, is of a peculiar kind ; the yellow or red painting of the exterior walls \u2014 the white stucco ornaments contrasting with the green lattices \u2014 the pillars and cornices, all these an nounce your approach to the region of the fine arts. The broad chanting pronunciation of the Pied montese is replaced here by the close unintelligible accent of the Genoese dialect. It is the variety of people, as well as that of landscape, that renders a tour in Italy so interesting, and that gives to this country a charm of novelty not to be found in any other. Every fifty miles you find yourself in another country, among people quite different from those you have left; and every where you find peculiar features and new curiosities which attract attention. But this same variety is the misfortune of Italy ; it resembles the trappings with which victims were adorned before sacrifice : it prevents that similarity of character and that national spirit, without which no country can be great. On going out of Novi, we began to ascend the Apennines. The country about Novi is fertile; gardens, orchards, and pleasant green meadows, surround the town. This place was the scene of a sanguinary contest between the Russians, com manded by Marshal Suwarrow, and the French, under General Joubert, in which the latter were"], [430, "92 LA BOCCHETTA. totally defeated, and Joubert slain. The battle of Novi took place in August, 1799- As we continued to ascend, we observed that the scenery assumed that wild and barren aspect peculiar to the Apennines, and so different from the lower Alpine regions. We passed the defile of Gavi, through which runs the Lemmo, a tor rent, which in the rainy season overflows the whole valley, and is rendered unfordable. The small castle of Gavi, built on a commanding hill, and almost impregnable by situation, defends the pas sage. The country around is rocky and desolate. Continuing to ascend, we came to Voltaggio, a large village, embosomed in the mountains, in the midst of the wildest scenery. Thence, in about an hour, we arrived at La Bocchetta, the name of the highest point over which this road passes. There a new and brilliant landscape was spread before our eyes. Around us, the rugged and barren Apennines with their uniform conical summits; down their sides, forests of chesnut trees, through the dark thick foliage of which glimmered white spires of churches, and the greyish roofs of the houses covered with slates of lavagna ; at the foot of the mountains, several narrow valleys were seen branching in various directions ; and beyond them appeared the blue waters of the Mediterranean, bordering on the horizon, and sparkling with the"], [431, "93 RAMPARTS OF GENOA. reflection of the sun. The cool sea breeze, the picturesque dress of the peasantry, the inexpres sible magic of southern nature and southern cli mate \u2014 every thing inspires the spectator with a feeling of pleasant melancholy, somewhat like the languor produced by soft music. As you descend into the valley of Polcevera, the magnificent villas of the Genoese nobility tell you of your approach to a great city, to Genova la superba; but that city is still concealed behind a range of steep and lofty hills, crowned with fortifications, above which rise the three commanding summits of II Diamante and I due Fratelli. It was under those inaccessible ramparts that many a valiant host was encamped during the late wars. There the French, the Austrians, and the English have successively ba lanced the destinies of Italy. We arrived at Campomarrone, a village so called from the number of chesnut-trees _ which surround it. This is the last post before you ar rive at Genoa. We saw, a little farther on, the beginning of the new road which strikes off to the east through a valley, avoiding the mountain of La Bocchetta, and which, passing by the village of Serravalle near the river Scrivia, joins the old road on the other side, near Novi. The ascent is much easier than that of the Bocchetta. It will be passable in a few months, and will prove a great"], [432, "94 VALLEY OF LA POLCEVERA. convenience to travellers, who at present are miser ably jolted on the rough old paved road. On leaving Campomarrone, the road proceeds along the rocky bed of La Polcevera, which, like that of all the Apennine streams, is nearly dry in summer. The habitations now become thicker; village succeeds village, until at last the road is entirely lined on one side by a range of houses; and on a sudden turn to the left, you find yourself in the magnificent suburb of San Pier d' Arena, close on the sea shore. You pass the outer line of fortifications with which Genoa is surrounded, you admire the noble light-house built on an insulated rock, and enter at last the amphitheatre, formed by the mountains and the sea, around which the city proudly rises. Genova la superba, for this is the appropriate epithet which was given it in the time of its splen dour, and which it still deserves on account of its stately buildings and commanding situation, stands partly on the declivity of several hills rising in a semicircle round the harbour, and partly on a nar row slip of ground between them and the sea. The harbour is in the form of a half moon, about a mile and a half in length ; its entrance faces the south, and is protected in part by two moles running across from the two extremities, but leav ing between them an open space of about half a"], [433, "95 VIEW OF GENOA. mile, through which the sea rushes in tremendously when the wind blows from that quarter. Vessels, however, can lie in security in that part of the harbour which is behind the old mole. They talk now of stretching this mole farther, over several sunken rocks, so as to approach nearer to the Molo Novo, behind which is the station for vessels performing quarantine. The city seen from the light-house on entering the gates presents a most magnificent coup d'\u0153il. A succession of fine build ings, more than two miles in length, lines the shore. The loftiness and elegance of the houses in general; their painted walls and white roofs; the numerous palaces and gardens, churches and convents, rising one above the other on the steep sides of the hills that rear, from behind, their dark and barren heads crowned with formidable ram parts, forts, and batteries; a noble harbour, where thousands of vessels may lie at anchor: the whole gives a grand idea of the former riches and power of this city, once the rival of Venice, and the mis tress of the Mediterranean. As you proceed, you arrive at the inner line of fortifications, which divides the old city from the new. You pass the gate of San Tommaso, and arrive at the Piazza dell' Acqua Verde, whence that line of fine streets begins, which is the prin cipal boast of Genoa. These three streets, Balbi,"], [434, "96 STRADA BALBI. Novissima, and Nova, are lined with two rows of splendid palaces, belonging to the nobility, among which, those of Durazzo, Balbi, Brignole, Lomel lino, and Serra, are the most remarkable. The first of these has a valuable collection of fine paintings, to which strangers are always allowed free access, according to the truly liberal spirit of the Italian nobility. Servants are always stationed in the ante-rooms, ready to accompany the ama teurs through the splendid suite of apartments which contains the treasures of the fine arts. One of the most remarkable paintings in the Durazzo col lection is that of the Magdalen washing the feet of our Saviour, by Veronese, and one of the best works of that great master. There are, in another room, three paintings by Luca Giordano, one of which re presents the death of Seneca. The Palazzo Du razzo is really a residence fit for a sovereign \u2014 its facade is very fine. There is another palace be longing to the same family, also in Strada Balbi, which is remarkable for its magnificent marble staircase boldly suspended, as it were, in the air. This part of the architecture of the Genoese palaces is perhaps the most remarkable, and well deserves the attention of strangers. The Palazzo Serra, in Strada Nova, has a splendid saloon, rich with lapis-lazuli and gold: it is lined with mirrors reach ing from the ceiling to the floor, and which,"], [435, "97 STREETS AND SQUARES. fleeting one another, multiply the objects ad infinitum, so that the spectator is at first apt to think himself in the middle of a long vista of rooms. The ceiling is finely painted to represent the triumph of a Genoese captain of this family over the Turks. I was told that the expense of this superb saloon amounted to a million of Genoese livres, about thirty-five thousand pounds sterling. When illuminated on great occasions, it must be almost too dazzling to the eyes. Between Strada Balbi and Strada Novissima, is an irregular square, on one side of which stands the church dell' Annunziata, one of the finest in Genoa. It was built by the family of Lomellino ; its interior is rich in marbles and paintings. At the end of Strada Nova you meet with another irregular square, called delle Fontane Amorose ; thence, ascending the hill, and turning to the right , you pass by the grand hospital, a magnificent building, and you arrive at Strada Giulia, which leads to the eastern gate of Genoa, and to the Fauxbourg of Bisagno. This succession of streets, which crosses the city from west to east, is the only way through which carriages can pass; the rest of the streets are, on account of their narrowness and steepness, imprac ticable for any wheeled vehicle. They are all, how ever, well paved, and remarkably clean, and very Vol. II. II"], [436, "98 CHURCH OF CARIGNANO. convenient for pedestrians, such as are all the in habitants of Genoa. Ladies going to the theatre, or evening parties, are carried in sedan chairs, of which there is a great number, private and for hire. Genoa is, as may be supposed by what has been said, a very quiet city ; and a stranger arriving from a large capital finds it rather dull, on ac- count of the stillness that reigns in it, particularly at night. The streets being very narrow, and the buildings generally five or six stories high, each story very lofty, the shops and the lower part of the houses are dark and gloomy. The best apart- ments in Genoa are generally in the upper floor ; but their tenants are subjected to the inconvenience of ascending seventy or eighty steps to reach them. This, however, is the case only in the lower part of the city, for, on ascending the hills, the houses are lower, and being raised one above another, are airy, and command a fine prospect of the town and the sea. The district of Carignano, situated on a high hill to the south-east, between the fortifications and the sea, is the best in the city for its situation. On the highest part of it stands the church of the same name, dedicated to the Virgin. Its lofty dome forms a prominent feature in the view of Genoa. Proceeding to it from the square of Sarzana, you pass a bridge of one arch,"], [437, "VIEW FROM THE DOME. 99 built over the street de' Servi, which connects the two opposite hills. This bold structure was raised at the same time with the church, by a noble Genoese family, of the name of Sauli, and the idea of it originated in a pique between them and a rival house: so powerful and rich were the lords of the little republic! From the summit of the dome there is a fine view of Genoa, and of the neigh bouring country. On a clear day, one can see the greater part of the Riviera di Ponente, or western coast, as far as Capo delle Mele, and the Alps of Piedmont, towering from behind; but towards the east, the bold promontory of Porto Fino, advancing into the sea, closes the view on that side ; to the south, you can perceive the mountains of the island of Corsica. The hill of Carignano, be hind the church, is covered with gardens ; there is a pleasant walk along the adjoining ramparts, look ing over the sea, and leading round by the walls of Santa Chiara to the gate of L'Acquasola. The prospect from this walk is beautiful. The valley of Bisagno, and the suburb of this name, lie before you ; and the hills of Albaro, covered with elegant country-houses and gardens, contrast with the abrupt barren mountains which terminate the view. The neighbourhood of Genoa is rich in variety of scenery. To the north of the city rises a very steep hill , on the top of which is built the fort of II 2"], [438, "100 FORTIFICATIONS OF GENOA. Lo Sperone, which commands the whole town, and is the summit of a triangle, of which the outer line of fortifications form two sides, and the sea the base. The city occupies but a small part of the extensive space enclosed within; the rest of the ground is, in a great measure, waste and naked. That part of the fortifications of Genoa which overlooks the valley of Polcevera, may be con sidered impregnable ; but the eastern side, towards the valley of Bisagno, is by no means so formidable. It was on this side that the English army attacked it in 1814, and in a few days got possession of the outer works, by which means they obliged the French to capitulate. It must be observed, that the French garrison was weak, and chiefly com posed of conscripts. It requires a numerous army, like that which Massena had in this city in 1799, to defend a line of works of ten or twelve miles in extent. The Piedmontese government is now adding to the fortifications, and when the ad ditional works are completed, Genoa, garrisoned by a sufficient number of men, may be considered as the strongest hold in Italy. A Frenchman of rank, who visited Genoa lately, showed some pee vishness on seeing these improvements, remarking, with a sneer, that Le Roi de Sardaigne rive bien les clous aux Genois ; it is, however, only what the French would willingly have done themselves."], [439, "101 COMMERCE OF THE GENOESE. Genoa is essentially a commercial place ; the barrenness of the soil, the small extent of its ter ritories, and their favourable situation along the shores of the Mediterranean, naturally turned the attention of the inhabitants to maritime trade, in which they succeeded so well, that their city be- came the emporium of western Europe. The capi- tal its merchants had collected enabled them to retain much of their former influence, even after commerce had taken another direction, in conse- quence of the discovery of the passage to India by the Cape of Good Hope. The Genoese became the bankers of Europe, and their harbour con- tinued to be the depot for foreign goods in the Mediterranean. Conveniently situated within a few days' sail of Spain, Africa, and Sicily, vessels of every nation came into this port to deposit or exchange their cargoes, and the Genoese were the consignees, warehousemen, and brokers, of all the Mediterranean merchants ; a number of them, be- sides, were established over all the different coasts, and Genoa was the central point with which fac- tors from Lisbon, Cadiz, Malaga, Barcelona, the coast of Barbary, and the Scale of Levant, corre sponded. The Bank of St. George lent money to the different governments of Europe, and the proud Genoese nobility did not disdain to emjfloy their funds in trade. The character of the Genoese"], [440, "102 DECLINE OF GENOA. was peculiarly adapted to the mercantile pro fession. Sober, industrious, and parsimonious ; shrewd, active, and intelligent ; less fond of plea sure and show than the Venetian people, less am bitious and haughty than the Patricians of the latter republic, they accommodated themselves better to circumstances, and were more pliant in their connexions with foreign powers ; but they also knew, in case of need, how to defend their inde pendence : interest and patriotism joined together on those occasions. But, like all human prosperity, theirs could not last for ever. They had resisted many shocks, but by degrees they became weaker and weaker, and at last found themselves wholly unprepared for the great earthquake which over turned all Europe : the French revolution crushed them with the rest. When the republican armies began to attempt the conquest of Italy, the Genoese, instead of per ceiving that it was their interest to join the other Italian states for repelling the common enemy, the foreign intruder, seemed only awake to their petty jealousies against the Piedmontese. They temporized with the French, and let themselves be cajoled by the crafty democrats who then ruled over France ; incited by the thirst of gain, they supplied the republicans with provisions, and allowed them to enter their western territories :"], [441, "FALL OF THE REPUBLIC. 103 the French exchequer was in their debt for several millions, which they were afraid of losing. In the mean time, the population of Genoa, at tacked by the disease of democracy, began to dis like their aristocratical rulers. The grey-headed pilots who were at the helm of the state, accus tomed to long seasons of calm weather and smooth seas, were unable to steer through such an unpre cedented storm; and the frail bark, after being tossed about and buffetted for a while by the con tending elements, was upset by the overwhelming waves. Such was the fate of Genoa ; and, what was worse, it carried along with it the fate of Italy. Had the western passes been defended by real patriots, by people proud of the name of Italians, the French would not have been able to encamp quietly on the fine shores of the Riviera, there to provide themselves with abundant supplies, and to watch for the favourable opportunity to climb over the mountains of Mondovi and Montenotte, from which they rushed like a sweeping torrent over the prostrate regions of Lombardy. Thus far the Genoese did not act like real Italians, and they suffered for it. The short-lived Ligurian Republic enjoyed only a mock independence, under the paramount influence of France ; its treasures were laid open for the maintenance of"], [442, "104 FEELINGS OF THE GENOESE. the armies ; their capital suffered all .the horrors of war and famine ; and when the fate of the mother republic was mastered by an extraordinary and ambitious man, proud Genoa was obliged to send her own Doge and Senators to dance attend ance on the ruler of the day, and to beg the honour of being annexed to the French empire ! Fit retribution for their want of national character and spirit. The Genoese became French, and many of them imbibed all the notions of their new compatriots ; still the peasantry here, as every where else, de tested these pretended friends, and real masters. The sea-faring people, who form a very important part of the population of this country, saw their profession annihilated, in consequence of the con tinental system ; and the only resource left them to avoid starvation was the honour of serving on board the imperial fleet stationary in the harbour of Toulon. But the greatest part of the Genoese sailors were too enterprising and too fond of inde pendence, to allow themselves to be cooped up in those magnificent hulks, where they had not often a chance of seeing the enemy ; many of them, therefore, took French leave, repaired to the English establishments in the Mediterranean, and entered as sailors on board foreign vessels. Others formed associations, and scoured the seas as pri-"], [443, "105 THE ENGLISH BESIEGE GENOA. vateers, in which capacity they greatly annoyed the British trade in the Mediterranean, and often captured their own countrymen serving on board vessels under the English flag. Some of their captains, such as Ludovico, Dodero, Serra, and others, made a great number of prizes, which they sold in the harbours of Barbary. Such were the beneficial effects of the French prohibitory system upon a commercial and maritime nation ; love of plunder, dereliction of their country and families, and total demoralization. At last the star of Napoleon grew dim, and disappeared in the gloom of a Russian winter. The consequences of his reverses were particularly felt in the foreign provinces of his empire. The Genoese were by this time almost tired of the French, and they became unruly. A year after, the English forces landed in the Riviera di Le vante, and encamped under the walls of Genoa. The French garrison was weak ; the people were enraged against them ; women and children abused the French in the streets; the statue of Bona parte, in the Piazza dell' Acqua Verde, was hurled down from its pedestal, and broken in a thousand fragments. The French commanders saw that the hour of retaliation was come, and that further resistance would prove fatal: they capitulated, but, probably on account of what"], [444, "106 UNION OF GENOA TO PIEDMONT. they considered as the rebellious spirit of the Genoese, they only made terms for the garrison, and left the city at the mercy of the victors. How ever, the Genoese republic was provisionally re established, but shortly after, the congress of Vi enna disposed otherwise of its fate, and Genoa was given up to the King of Sardinia. I will not enter into the question of the right and justice of this last measure, but I shall offer a few remarks on its expediency : as it is well known that go vernments, in their foreign politics, are seldom directed by the same strict rules of morality, as in dividuals in their civil and domestic concerns. The lesser evil must often be adopted, and political justice is generally but comparative. The union of Genoa to Piedmont, however con demned by some politicians, and deplored by mis taken patriots, will, probably, if considered on an enlarged scale, and with regard to its effects, be found more conducive to the future welfare and independence of Italy than the former state of that republic under its antiquated oligarchy. On the other hand, Genoa could not possibly remain under a democratic form in the present state of Europe ; the nobility are too rich, and the people too mercenary. It would, besides, be a continual scene of cabal for discontented Italians and in triguing foreigners, and would fall an easy prey"], [445, "ADVANTAGES RESULTING FROM IT. 107 to any of its powerful neighbours. As for the Genoese, they are now as well off as most con tinental people, and better than many. Their flag is new free, and respected every where ; while under their ancient republican government, they did not dare to lose sight of their native shores, ex cept in well armed vessels, for fear of being taken by the Barbary Corsairs, and carried to Algiers and Tunis, there to end their days in slavery and despair. The removal of this evil is alone a bene fit of such magnitude, for a sea-faring nation like them, as to overbalance their prejudices against their present government. I was at Genoa in 1816, about the time of Lord Exmouth's expedition against Algiers, and I wit nessed the satisfaction of the Genoese at the arrival of the British frigate which brought the happy tidings, and restored their countrymen who had worn so long the chains of the Moslems. The sentiments of gratitude and regard towards the English, which they had sincerely professed, when they were delivered from the French yoke, were then renewed; but this most essential and disinterested service is now nearly forgotten, in con sequence of the prejudices which some people take pains to instil in the minds of the people of the Continent against the English. They cannot deny the benefit, but they make light of it ; they say,"], [446, "108 GENOESE FLAG RESPECTED. that the forbearance of the Barbary powers is but temporary ; they endeavour, against all common sense, to hint at the interested views of England, even on this occasion ; but it is useless to repeat here all their sophisms, which are well known to every one who has travelled on the Continent. However, I am happy to say, that the plain un sophisticated minds of the Genoese sailors see things in a better light. I have conversed, tra velled, and lived with them, and found them sen sible of the benefit conferred on them by the English, and proudly confident of their future protection. A person who has not visited the coast of Bar bary can hardly form a proper idea of the suffer ings to which Christian slaves were exposed, and cannot, therefore, appreciate the full value of Lord Exmouth's expedition, which put a stop to that abominable practice. While I was at Tunis, there were several hundred slaves at la Goletta or the harbour, where they were employed in the construction of the public works, carrying heavy burdens, exposed all day to the scorching rays of an African sun, covered with rags and vermin, allowed a scanty and bad diet, drinking brackish water, ill-treated and beaten by their surly keepers; in this manner they passed their days: at sunset they were huddled together in a sort of"], [447, "109 REFLECTIONS ON SLAVERY. barrack, there to lay their weary limbs on a heap of bad straw, breathing in a suffocating and cor rupted atmosphere, to rise again with the next sun to fresh torments; year after year passed without bringing any alteration to their condition, and the best part of their life was spent in unavail ing regret. The fate of the female slaves was often still more deplorable and dreadful. The mind recoils at the idea of the horrors of their situa tion. The benefit conferred by England, at the cost of her blood and treasure, on the nations of Italy, is, therefore, inestimable ; and yet there are men calling themselves enlightened and liberal, who strive to diminish the sense of it in the hearts of the Italians; these men are, however, feelingly alive to any instance of severity on the part of their governments against any one of their party. Their system of politics is not so inconsistent as it appears to a person unacquainted with their real principles. They winked at the atrocities of the revolution, they approved of the injustices of the imperial government; but they are always ready to exclaim against the threat- ening power of Russia, the encroaching system of Austria, the ambition of England, and the fanaticism of Rome. They extolled to the skies Bonaparte's decrees against convents and the in- quisition, but they make light of the suppression of"], [448, "110 GENOESE SAILORS. the slave trade, and of the abolition of Christian captivity effected by England ; they very discrimi nately point out the imperfections of these last measures, and the private views which they sup pose have dictated them but enough of these equitable people. \" Intelligent pauca.\" The Genoese sailors are the best in the Medi terranean, and resemble the British tars more than any others; they are a hardy, manly, and steady race ; and were their vessels equal to those of the English, they would be worthy perhaps of bearing a fuller comparison with the latter*.

A governor-genei-al, who resides at Genoa, is the representative of the sovereign. Genoa has its separate senate, courts, and code of laws. Much care is taken to conciliate the minds of the Genoese ; the civil employments are filled by them, they have national regiments, the commissions of which are given exclusively to natives. The Piedmontese troops in the garrison of Genoa are kept in the strictest discipline, and severely forbidden to enter into any dispute with the inhabitants; and when such instances occur, the decision of the authorities is generally in favour of the Genoese. A new road has been constructed at a great expense along the mountainous coast of the Riviera di Levante, by which a direct commu- nication is opened from Genoa to Leghorn and the south of Italy, and will prove a great advantage to the inland commerce of the Genoese. Many travellers going to Rome and Naples will pass by Genoa, instead of going round by Milan and Bologna. Until now, Genoa has only been ac- cessible on one side by land, over the difficult road of the Bochetta ; but in future it will be open in two directions, by two fine carriage roads, the one to Turin and Milan by Serravalle, and the other to Leghorn by Lerici. Another road is also"], [450, "112 LATE FRENCH ADMINISTRATION. being constructed along the Western Riviera to Nice and France. All these are no trifling improvements, and de serve to be duly appreciated, when we consider that the King of Sardinia is, in riches and means, but one of the inferior powers of Europe. I have met, among the Genoese, dispassionate men who are willing to do justice to their present govern ment, but they complain of the bad effect of taxes upon industry and commerce. This, however, is the universal complaint all over the continent; much might be said, too, in apology of the existing financial system, which was left by the French as a forced inheritance upon the present governments of Europe, and which it would be injudicious, and perhaps impracticable, for the latter to change entirely. The French introduced the present system of taxation and administration in Italy, and thereby produced an universal change in every branch of political and civil economy ; the swarms of people they employed in their num berless bureaux ; and the hosts of gens d'armes and custom-house officers, who swelled the ranks of their partisans ; the great military establishment ; all these were gifts conferred by the French on the Italians. The governments that succeeded them could not turn all these people adrift, as"], [451, "113 NATIONAL PREJUDICES. these would have then become their declared enemies, and cried aloud against the injustice of such a measure. A great part of them have, therefore, been kept in office ; and to give them bread most of the taxes have been continued, at which the population murmurs, and those very people who live upon this system often join in the cry. This shows how difficult it must be in the present times to govern mankind \u2014 how impossible to please every body. But I think the principal source of the dissatis faction of the Genoese is to be attributed to their old prejudices against their neighbours the Pied montese. This is one of the precious consequences of the division of Italy into so many little states, which some statesmen wanted to perpetuate, by opposing the only preparatory way of removing the evil, namely, that of uniting those fragments into three or four grand divisions. But, forsooth ! it did not suit every one \u2014 and no political measure ever will. The Piedmontese were for centuries the subjects of the house of Savoy, and the house of Savoy was not always on the best terms with the most Serene Republic of Genoa. The Genoese and Pied montese, therefore, although both Italians, and living within a few miles of each other, disliked each other as cordially as the Spaniards and Vol. II. I"], [452, "114 NATIONAL ANTIPATHY. the French did. Hence arose national abusive ex pressions and nick-names, and the hatred was per petuated from father to son. The Piedmontese are fond of a sort of pudding made of polenta or Indian corn flour, for which the Genoese called them mangia polenta; the Genoese are indus trious and economical, the Piedmontese called them Jews. \u2014 These and other feuds, equally rea sonable, nursed their hatred ; just as Goldsmith's invalid hated the French because they wore wooden shoes. Meantime the communications between the two countries were very rare ; the inhabitants of Turin and Genoa, although living only at a hundred miles distance, knew each other as little as those of Paris and Petersburg. By the union of the two countries this obstacle has been removed. The two people mix together ; they learn to appreciate their respective good qualities; they have a common sovereign, common interests, and a common lan guage, as they always have had a common countrv and a common religion. A certain mistrust and dislike still exists ; but if government pursues a moderate and conciliatory system, the Piedmontese and Genoese, after a generation or two, will look upon each other as children of the same family, and those among them who may then read the debates upon the annexation of these countries will smile at the instability of human opinions. This"], [453, "PRESENT STATE OF COMMERCE. 115 is the case in all annexations; surely Lorraine, Alsace, Burgundy, Guienne, Poitou,and Britanny, are not now the worse for being united to France ; although at the time of their union many interests were wounded, the result has been for the general good. But the passions of men blind them to general truths, and their ideas are narrowed by prejudices. The commerce of Genoa is not what it once was; still, in the present stagnation of affairs, there is more business going on here than in any other port of Italy. There are great capitalists in this place eager to employ their funds to ad vantage. Genoese vessels now trade directly with the West Indies, where their flag had never been seen before. The Piazza Banchi or ex change, and the Porto Franco, where goods are deposited in warehouses without paying any duty, offer lively scenes of bustle and activity. The Genoese in general show no particular taste for elegant pursuits and amusements; commerce is their grand occupation, and their calculating spirit leaves them neither time nor money to spare for the construction of public edifices dedicated to the fine arts and literature. Genoa is worse off for theatres than any other Italian capital. The theatre of Sant' Agostino, which is the principal one, is sufficiently large, but ill constructed and I 2"], [454, "116 THEATRE. poorly decorated. The performers are also in general very inferior. The house is seldom filled, and the profits are too small to enable the manager to engage first-rate actors. It is only during the winter that operas are performed here; in the rest of the year comedies and tragedies are acted. The present company, Granara, is tolerably good ; it has one or two respectable tragic performers. I saw the other night II Saulle, one of the finest tragedies of Alfieri. The part of Saul was well acted by a performer of the name of Subotich. I had formerly seen Filippo performed in this theatre to great advantage. Gnudi and Verzura, two of the best Italian actors, have lately left this company. L' Avvocato Nota, a Genoese, has lately written several good comedies. The young gentry of this place do not much frequent the public theatres, but seem to have a taste for private acting, and unite in companies of dilettanti for the purpose. I was present the other night at one of these per formances at a house on the hill of Albaro, and was pleased with their exertions; indeed it would scarcely be fair to criticise with severity, people, who, with a social spirit, provide amusement at their own expense, and distribute tickets gratis to their acquaintance. This liberal taste is more common in Italy than foreigners imagine."], [455, "117 STATE OF LEARNING. Genoa cannot be called a city of learning, and that for the reasons already stated. There is, however, an university, a Collegio de' Nobili, and several public libraries. Among the men belong ing to the learned professions, some rhetoricians, poets, and beaux-esprits are to be found. The poets Chiabrera and Frugoni were Genoese, at least from the territory. Genoa boasts of having given birth to Cristoforo Colombo. The Genoese have produced some good finan ciers; Count Corvetto, late minister of finance in France, and the Marquis Brignole, the minister at Turin, both were from this country. The churches of Genoa are remarkable, not so much for their exterior architecture, as for the magnificence and taste displayed in their interior. The most important of them, besides those already mentioned, are ; the cathedral of St. Lorenzo, the front of which is constructed in a barbarous taste ; the church of St. Siro, which is the most fre quented on Sunday by the upper classes ; that of Le Vigne; and the church of St. Ambrose, belong ing to the Jesuits, which contains a fine Assump tion, by Guido. The church of San Stefano, near the eastern gate, possesses the famous painting by Giulio Romano, representing the martyrdom of St. Stephen. It was taken to Paris by the French, but has been since restored to its proper place."], [456, "118 CHURCHES AND CEREMONIES. The religious ceremonies are performed at Ge noa with great splendour. On the twenty-third of September I was present at a great festival in the church of L' Annunziata, in honour of the Madonna della Mercede, a ceremony instituted by the religious order of this name, one of the most useful and interesting of monastic establishments, and whose object was to ransom the Christian slaves in Barbary. The church was full of people of all classes, the illumination was brilliant, the ornaments splendid, and the music fine, but some what too theatrical ; two orchestras were raised opposite each other, and the motivi resembled the ariettas of an opera. The music of the mass was by Anfossi, but the singers were not to be com pared with those of Rome or Naples. A short panegyric of the Virgin was delivered in pure Italian, by Padre Giannotti, a Roman Jesuit. A boy, twelve years of age sang the tantum ergo, with a good deal of effect. The benediction fob lowed and closed the ceremony, the whole of which was conducted with great decorum. I do not, however, much approve of the canto figur ato, used on these grand occasions in the Italian churches. How much more impressive is the ordi nary service, and the singing of vespers, through out the year, when the fine voices, with which Italy abounds, arise in solemn chorusses, accompanied"], [457, "CANTO GREGORIANO. 119 only by the swelling peals of the organ. The canto gregoriano, that simple primitive music, is so well adapted to religious sentiments, so much in unison with the sublime effusions of sacred poetry ! It soothes the heart \u2014 it elevates the mind above the selfish concerns of men \u2014 it gives us a foretaste of joys more pure \u2014 of an existence far beyond the limits of this visible world : \" C'est la que fimront un jour tous nos malheurs, Car 1' habitant des cieux ne verse point de pleurs.' Man comes out from the sacred ceremony refreshed and renovated, his feelings softened by religious melancholy ; and the effects of this disposition must be beneficial to himself and his fellow-creatures. The churches in Italy are open to every body, and every day in the year, from morning to night. There is no distinction of ranks: rich and poor, noble and plebeian, kneel clown together before the Supreme Being; the elegant lady and the humble menial are seen by the side of one another, uniting their voices, and joining in their suppli cations for that mercy of which they equally stand in need ; the beggar is not refused admit tance into the house of that God, before whom there is no distinction but that of the heart. At all times of the day people are seen entering the churches for the purpose of praying, and of seek-"], [458, "120 DEVOTION OF THE ITALIANS. ing consolation in devotion and quietness. I have often seen in the busiest hours, when the churches are generally deserted, some handsome well dressed female gliding silently along the solitary aisles to a retired corner, there prostrate herself at the foot of the altar, unconscious of being noticed by any one, praying with all the fervour of re ligious feelings, and shedding tears of repent ance. There can be no hypocrisy, no affectation, in such a practice : it is the afflicted mother pray ing for the welfare of her children ; it is the tender wife supplicating the Divine Goodness for the health of her husband; it is, in short, the afflicted creature seeking for comfort in the bosom of her God, through the intercession of those blessed spirits whom she considers as standing next to his throne. Whether her belief be right or not, her faith is sincere, her intentions pure, and the All-Merciful will not reject the tribute of an affectionate heart. The climate of Genoa is pleasant and healthy ; this city, sheltered in a great measure by the Apennines from the northern blast, and refreshed in summer by the evening breeze prevalent in the Mediterranean, enjoys a pure and salubrious atmosphere. The obnoxious scirocco loses its suf focating heat before it reaches this latitude, and is merely the bearer of clouds and the fore-runner"], [459, "121 CLIMATE OF GENOA. ' of rain, which falls at times very heavily, especi ally about the equinoxes. The cold is sometimes severe in winter, but it does not last. In the neighbourhood of Genoa, along the coast, there are many places where the climate is still milder and more genial than in the capital, such as Sestri and Pegli, in the Western Riviera, and Nervi, on the eastern one. These districts being completely sheltered by the mountains rising immediately behind them, the orange and lemon-trees grow in them in full luxuriance, and give to the country the appearance of a perpetual spring. There several of the wealthy Genoese families have de lightful villas, in which they spend the greater part of the year in a truly Elysian retirement. The air of Genoa, however, is reckoned too keen for persons having delicate chests, and the medical men advise the removal of such patients to the plains of Lombardy. Provisions are very reasonable, and lodgings remarkably so. A suite of apartments for a fa mily is let unfurnished for about twenty pounds a-year; furnished lodgings are in proportion. Most of the nobility let out a whole floor of their sumptuous palaces to merchants or to foreigners, while they themselves live in the country. A person can subscribe for the whole year to all the"], [460, "122 QUALITY OF PROVISIONS. theatrical amusements Genoa affords, including the masked balls, or festone, in the Carnival season, for the sum of one hundred Genoese livres, about three pounds ten shillings. Restaurateurs and coffee-houses are full as cheap as those of Turin, but not so clean nor comfortable ; wine is the only article which is comparatively dear. The common wine is imported from the south of France, and is sold much adulterated. There is, however, Mont- ferrat wine from Piedmont, which is genuine and good. The country wine, or vino nostrale, as the Genoese call it, is white and light; the best is made in the valley of Polcevera, in the district called Murta; it is not unpleasant to the taste, and is very inoffensive. Genoa is renowned for its paste, or maccaroni, of every size and shape, from the broad lasagne to the thin fedeli; they are ex- ported all over the Mediterranean and are in great repute. The shops in which they are sold are remarkable for their cleanliness and tasteful arrangement. Mushrooms form another article of great consumption and of exportation. The moun- tains and valleys about Genoa abound with them ; great quantities are cut in slices and dried, and afterwards sent abroad, to the amount of a million of Genoese livres annually. But the olive plan tations with which the Riviera di Ponente is co-"], [461, "123 GENOESE KITCHEN. vered, afford the principle branch of exportation. The fine oil of Genoa is equal to that of Lucca or of Provence. The hotels at Genoa are inferior to none in Italy for accommodations and comfort ; some of them are truly magnificent. They are built in the lower part of the city, near the harbour, of which they command the view. The City of London, the Imperial Hotel, and the Hotel de la Ville, are the most splendid. The charges are very moderate both for board and for lodgings. The Genoese cookery is very different from the Piedmontese; it is south Italian, like everything else. Oil is a common ingredient. The Genoese have several 'national dishes, such as ravioli, la sagne, and risoarrosto, which are good and whole some; also the capponata and the lorta, which are composed of a mixture of heterogeneous elements, and not very palatable to strangers, although they are a favourite treat to the natives ; eggs, meat, vegetables, sausage, anchovies, onions, bread, garlic, SsC, are all hashed together, and form a kind of olla podrida. Mushrooms are a common ingredient of a Genoese repast; they dress them in many different ways ; I never heard of accidents having happened from the use of them ; the people are well acquainted with the various kinds. In spite of the proverb, mare senza pesce, I have in"], [462, "124 HOUSES AND TERRACES. general found this city well supplied with good fish. Its ragoste, or large red lobsters, are re markably good. Meat of every kind and poultry are excellent; vegetables grow very fine in the gardens about Genoa ; fruit, is exquisite, although not so abundant as at Naples. The houses of this city have the advantage, very rare in the rest of Italy, of being supplied with spring water up to the highest floor and to the very terrace. The vicinity of the mountains has facilitated the means of extending this convenience ; and the inhabitants are thereby enabled to pre serve a greater degree of cleanliness than is observ able in other Italian towns. The top of the house is often converted into a terrace, or a kind of aerial garden, where the numerous flower-pots relieve agreeably the sight, and where the family resort in the summer evenings to enjoy the cool ness of the air, and to take their coffee or their supper. Those verdant spots in the midst of the grey slate, with which the houses are covered, afford a pleasing variety to a person looking from an elevated point upon the city. The staircase being common to all the tenants of the different floors, as is the case all over Italy, the street door is generally left open, from which circumstance a person has often the annoyance of having to pass through filth and nuisances to reach the foot of the"], [463, "125 GENOESE WOMEN. stairs; these, however, are clean, commodious, and well lighted. The Genoese women are among the handsomest of Italy; indeed, this city can boast of a decided superiority with regard to female beauty. In no other place have I seen such a number of interest ing countenances collected together as in the streets, churches, and places of public resort at Genoa. They have, in general, elegant figures, delicate complexions, dark hair and eyes, and pretty features ; and their carriage is remarkably graceful. Their dress is also well calculated to set off their charms \u2014 it is simple and neat ; a white muslin gown, well fitted to the shape, and a white veil, called pezzotto, thrown tastefully over the head and shoulders, so as not to conceal but to shade their contour, give them the appearance of so many Madonnas. This is the national dress common to all classes, only varying in the fineness and costliness of the materials. These women are remarkably clean in their persons, perhaps superior in this to other Italian females. Very few of them wear straw hats or bonnets ; indeed, it is to be wished, for the sake of beauty and taste, that they may not adopt foreign fashions, which can not suit them better than their own costume. Often have I admired, in the streets of Genoa, countenances not inferior to the fine models of art"], [464, "126 MARRIAGES. left to us by the Greek sculptors, or to the en chanting productions of Raphael and Corregio. Often have they recalled to my memory those beautiful lines of Byron : \" One of those forms which flit by us, when we Are young, and fix our eyes on every face ; And oh ! the loveliness at times we see In momentary gliding, the soft grace, The youth, the bloom, the beauty which agree In many a nameless being we retrace, Whose course and home we knew not, nor shall know, Like the lost Pleiad seen no more below.\" Marriage is at Genoa a matter of calculation, perhaps more so than any where else ; it is generally settled between the relations, who often draw up the contract before the parties have seen one another, and it is only when every thing else is arranged, and a few days previous to the marriage ceremony, that the future husband is introduced to his intended partner for life. Should he find fault with her figure or manners, he may break up the match, on condition of defraying the expenses incurred. But this is seldom the case ; the principal object, that of interest, being once settled, the bride follows the portion as a matter of course, and is often scarcely minded. There are in this city marriage brokers, who have pocket books filled with the names of marriageable girls of different classes, with notes descriptive"], [465, "127 PATITI, OR CAVALIER SERVENTI. of their figures and their fortunes ; these people go about endeavouring to arrange connexions ; if they succeed they get a commission of two or three per cent, upon the portion. The contents of their memorandums are often very curious. The custom of having a patito (such is the modern word substituted for cicisbeo, is still prevailing among the Genoese ladies. The pa tience of those individuals is truly astonishing. They are the humble servants of their fair sove reigns ; they accompany them to church, to walk, to their evening parties, to the theatre ; thejr keep them company at home, in short, they fol low them as their shadows, and submit to their whims ; for which they have, in return, a free access to the house, and a seat at table. Strange as it may appear to foreigners, this custom is, in many cases, nothing more than a matter of cere mony, the remains of a chivalrous feeling of gal lantry, or the result of mutual convenience. The lady finds her patito to be a very useful person, a sine qua non, while her husband, absorbed in his commercial speculations, has little time or patience to attend to her petty concerns. The patito in his turn finds her society agreeable, and his court ship is often nothing more to him than the means of killing time: he is generally the friend of the husband, sometimes his partner in business. It"], [466, "128 HABITS AND MANNERS. happens, therefore, that if a lady has a real in trigue, she must keep it concealed from her patito as well as from her husband ; and the object of her partiality, ilfavorito ; as he is sometimes called, is kept in the back ground. In the lower classes, and among the peasantry, however, there is no patito nor favorito ; the husbands are jealous of their prerogatives, and their wives are attached to them and submissive. The Genoese women have in general a consi- derable share of coquetry ; they are fond of being ad- mired. In many families of the old school, the cus- tom prevails of having a clergyman, called il prete di casa, who is a kind of governor to the children, and is looked upon as one of the family. A certain degree of veneration towards ecclesiastics still remains among these people, especially in the country; and I have had occasion to see that influence usefully employed for charitable and Christian purposes. The clergy have had little op portunity of interfering in political matters in this country, and have kept clear from that ambitious spirit which has been reproached to them in other parts of Europe. The citizens of Genoa are entirely mercantile people, and, generally speaking, nothing else. This spirit of industry, although praiseworthy in itself, is often carried too far, and degenerates"], [467, "129 SPIRIT OF CALCULATION. into avarice and selfishness. Nothing is heard here but calculations. If two or three persons are conversing together, one may be almost sure they are talking of money matters ; boys in the streets are making rules of arithmetic, and even the fair sex is by no means deficient in the practical know ledge of that science. Few opportunities of profit, however paltry, are overlooked by a Genoese. It is astonishing upon how little they live ; they beat even the economical Florentines in that respect. Their currency is very small, their lire fuori banco is worth about eight-pence English ; so that the high-sounding sum of thirty thousand lire, which here is looked upon as a fortune, is, after all, but one thousand pounds. Salaries, profits, marriage portions, every thing, is on the same scale. A person in the middling ranks of society having six thousand lire, or two hundred pounds a year, is reckoned rich. It must be said that they live in general but poorly ; and although they dress well and keep up a good appearance, yet the interior of their houses often presents the picture of scanti ness and stinginess. Their food is very plain, and their meals, except on particular occasions, are remarkably frugal. The citizens are not in general a good-looking race ; they are sallow and thin, and have mostly a common appearance and an awk ward gait. There is a striking difference between Vol. II. K"], [468, "130 LAWS this city and Naples ; in the latter the men are handsome and the women plain, while here it is precisely the reverse. I cannot imagine to what causes this singularity is to be ascribed. An inclination to gambling prevails among the Genoese ; it is their chief relaxation from business. Charity, and even common affection, between rela tives, are not very conspicuous amongst this people ; generous feelings are repressed by interest. I have seen a poor man actually begging at the door of his opulent brother, who had some food given to him by his servant ; instances of this sort are not rare, as by the chances of trade individuals of the same family are often placed in opposite cir cumstances. From the same spirit, a multitude of law-suits also spring, which, thanks to the sub tleties of the Genoese lawyers, are spun to the greatest possible length. The civil code has been altered, since the union of Genoa to the Sardinian states ; the French commercial code, however, continues pro tempore to be in vigour. But the difference of codes is of little consequence, where the ministers of the law are not equitable. Naples has preserved the code Napoleon, and yet there is no country in Europe where it is more difficult to obtain common justice. Men must be changed as well as laws, in order to effect a salutary improvement in the judiciary system of these"], [469, "131 MORALS. countries, and this must be the work of time, connected with the gradual amelioration of edu cation and of institutions, and, consequently, of sentiments and principles. What I have already said of the character and morals of the Genoese, will be sufficient to convey a general idea of them. Atrocious crimes are very rare ; robbers and banditti were once nu merous in the mountainous part of the country, and under the French their number had increased by the addition of the run-away conscripts, so as to render the hiafh road of la Bocchetta unsafe to the very gates of Genoa, but they are now no longer heard of. Beggars were swarming in this city, particularly during the scarcity in 1816 and 1817, but now very few are to be seen. Instances of suicide take place now and then, chiefly at the bridge of Carignano, from which the wretched victims of despair throw themselves headlong into the street de' Servi underneath. The Genoese nobility is divided in two classes, called Portico Vecchio and Portico Novo. The most illustrious names of the republic, the Spinola, the Doria, the Negroni, the Balbi, the Fieschi, the Sauli, belong to the first. Some of the lateral branches of these great families live in a state of comparative poverty; but the Genoese nobility, is, upon the whole, possessed still of K 2"], [470, "132 OLD GENOESE NOBILITY. great wealth, and many of them employ their funds in commerce. Under the ancient republic, the patricians enjoyed great power and often abused it ; their haughtiness towards the inferior classes was overbearing, and the least show of resentment from the latter, was punished in a peremptory manner. Even in the church (contrary to the practice of Catholic countries) the proud lady was preceded by her attendants, carrying cushions for her to kneel upon, at the sight of which the plebeian females made room immedi ately, and retired to a respectful distance. In suits at law, a common citizen had very little chance against a nobleman ; for although the courts might condemn the latter, still he was ge nerally able to bid defiance to the law. I have heard a dreadful instance of this related to me at Genoa. The story is as follows; I give it without, however, vouching for its authenticity. In the valley called della Secca, formed by one of the branches of the torrent Polcevera, there lived a nobleman deeply encumbered with debts ; a writ had been issued against him by the civil court, but his fierce disposition being well known, no officer was found bold enough to venture into the lion's den, to communicate the sentence to him. At last an usciere, a sort of bailiff, to whose child the pa trician had stood godfather, presuming upon the"], [471, "133 OLD ITALIAN REPUBLICS. intimacy resulting from this connexion, went to him. The Genoese dissembled his wrath, and asked the man to rest and refresh himself, but shortly after, having given his orders to his satel lites, he had the unsuspecting victim seized, and, horrid to relate, had him thrown into a heated oven, where he soon expired. The villa or man sion where this deed of horror was committed has been pointed out to me near the road, or rather, path, leading to the village of Piedemonte. The loss of the boasted liberties of the Genoese republic has been much regretted by people on both sides of the Alps. Men are but too often deceived by words and mere names, or led astray by party spirit: in this instance, let the subject be closely examined, and it will be found, that the Italian republics were the most tyrannical of governments, even worse than an absolute monarchy, at least for the great mass of the population'. Genoa contained a great number of convents, which were suppressed by the French ; several of them have been re-established by the present go vernment. This is another great subject of dis cussion amongst modern politicians. Unmodified judgments upon human institutions are generally erroneous : what is good under one climate, may be bad in another latitude ; and what was useful at one"], [472, "134 CONVENTS. time becomes obnoxious in another age. Among the votaries of the monastic rules, some have done much good, others have done much evil, and by far the greater number have drudged through life harmless and unminded, and in this they re semble every other society of human beings. We ought not for the sake of a few vicious and mis chievous characters, to condemn millions of indi viduals who have filled in succession the ranks of the orders of St. Benedict, St. Dominick, St. Francis, or even of Loyola. It has been too much the common fashion in our days to find fault with every thing that existed before the latter end of the eighteenth century. Monks, at that epoch, were numerous, respected, and often too powerful and wealthy ; are they now to be indiscrimi nately condemned and abused ? But of what use were they to society? This is the hackneyed question which every adept of the new school tri umphantly asks. Suppose the monastic orders, who, with the exception of the Franciscans, were all possessed of considerable 'property, had done nothing else but administer well their estates, and to make the yearly produce of them circulate through society, giving thereby employment to a number of servants, workmen, and labourers; they were, at least, as useful as other classes of landed pro prietors; and it is a well known fact, in Italy at"], [473, "135 MONASTIC PROPERTY. least, that lands belonnriny- to convents were well cultivated, that monks were kind to their tenants, and that at the end of the year the income and the expenditure were generally balanced pretty equally. But those lands, some will say, were either the gifts of superstition, or the produce of crafty usurpation. This is rather a bold assertion, and I doubt how far it would bear scrutiny ; but even allowing that the greater part of monastic property had been in former ages acquired by unlawful means, was it right to dispossess the present owners 1 Who was to succeed them ? It would be very difficult to trace out the original proprietors, and if such a measure were justifiable, it might, with equal right, be applied to all the landed property of the country, most of which would be found to have originated in rapine, murder, and all kinds of violence committed during the foreign invasions or the civil wars which deso lated Italy for so many centuries. The French, however, settled the matter : they spoliated the monks of their rich properties, the administration of which became a most important branch of the financial department ; they sold them often for one-third or one-fourth of their value, and both sellers and buyers contrived to make a very good business of 'it. Under the care of the demanio (such was the name of this office, which the Italians"], [474, "136 SALE OF MONASTIC PROPERTY. sometimes called demonio, i. e. the devil), the greatest dilapidations were committed, and the principal object seemed to be, to make as much ready money as possible. A property belonging once to the Carthusian Convent of San Martino, at Naples, and which brought twenty thousand ducats a year, was sold for sixty thousand only. Many of the fine buildings belonging to convents were destroyed, merely for the sake of the iron and timber which they contained. But it would be endless to record the details of the spoliation and plunder which were committed in the name, and for the welfare, of the nation. If the surplus of the revenues of monastic property, after de ducting a sufficient allowance for the decorous maintenance of their former possessors, had been exclusively applied to the advantage of the respective countries, to found schools and colleges, to erect hospitals and workhouses, in short, for humane and charitable purposes, then the violent usurpation might be overlooked in the general good, and the planners and executors of the new system be looked upon as people animated by enlarged views of improvement. But this was not the case ; those who enriched themselves in the traffic of national property were often most im moral men \u2014 the nation derived little or no ad vantage by the change, and the poor monks, even"], [475, "137 TREATMENT OF MONKS AND NUNS. the aged and the infirm, were granted a miser able pittance barely sufficient to support exist ence, and irregularly paid. Yet many of these individuals, particularly those of the wealthier orders, were men belonging to the most respect able families of the land, who had given up all their worldly prospects to spend their days in studious retirement ; and who, on entering the con vent, had brought from their paternal houses con siderable sums to be added to the funds of the order. The above remarks apply equally to convents of nuns. Shall I speak of the inhuman manner in which these helpless females were in many places turned out of their peaceful retreats by insolent gendarmes ? Young virgins were left unprotected in the middle of that world they had abjured ; weak aged women, who had not during half a century been out of the gates of their convents, were now thrust out, unable to walk, and their infirmities exposed to the scoffings of an unfeeling rabble. Surely, had the monastic orders done double the mischief which is attributed to them, even by their bitterest enemies, still their fall was accompanied by such severities, as to deserve the pity of the most cold-hearted philosopher. But monks were not merely indolent proprietors"], [476, "138 USEFUL EMPLOYMENTS OF MONKS. living in sloth and idleness. Many convents had schools for the education of youth; others had libraries open daily to the public; many of their inmates were professors at the different colleges and universities; others went about preaching the duties of religion ; they assisted the sick ; they made numerous charities. Even in a political point of view, the monastic orders, as independent bodies, formed a kind of barrier against the over whelming power of an arbitrary government. Are all these advantages to be overlooked, and only their faults to be strictly scrutinized and mag nified ? Is this justice \u2014 is this liberality ? Monks have been more inoffensive and more respectable in Italy than in any other country ; Italy, be it said to its honour, has had no Auto da Fe, no St. Barthelemy, no Smithfield burnings. I am inclined to look upon the existence of con vents, under certain regulations, as useful, if not necessary, in southern countries. Their number might be limited, as well as that of their respective inmates ; the age at which novices might be al lowed to bind themselves by vows should be fixed ; their revenues be regulated so as not to exceed their wants. Under these and other similar re strictions, in a country like Italy, these asylums for melancholy minds and broken hearts, these re-"], [477, "NUNNERIES. 139 treats from the dissipation and the vanities of the world, these nurseries of piety and learning, would prove beneficial to the commonwealth at large. I rambled the other day up to the convent of Le Turchine, at Castelletto. The situation of the house is beautiful ; it commands a view of the city and of the sea. This convent of nuns was re-established by Pope Pius VII. when he was at Genoa in 1815. An inscription placed under the porch commemorates the event. Over the gate, I read in large characters, these impres sive words \u2014 Clausa homini, sed aperta Deo. The pious consolatory sentiment expressed in them explains the feeling of satisfaction with which the Italian nuns in general re-entered within the walls of their monasteries, after having been tossed about in a world which they had renounced, and in which they found no proper place for them. The life of a recluse has also its attractions, espe cially for persons of a certain turn of mind ; I have known young women, perfectly free in their choice, and acquainted with the pleasures of the world, take the veil with as much cheerfulness as others proceed to the hymeneal altar. Instances are quoted, and most lamentable ones they are, of young lovely unwilling victims immured within the walls of a convent; this, however, is not the right way of judging of extensive institutions. Let the"], [478, "140 COUNTRY EXCURSIONS. abuses be separated from the right and useful object. Many inmates of convents have found there a better lot than they could have expected in the world. The inhabitants of Genoa are fond of the country and of rural excursions. Most families leave town in summer ; the wealthy repair to their v Me in the Riviera, and those of a humbler sphere hire apart ments in some of the neat casini with which the hills around Genoa are covered. On particular holidays, the whole population proceeds to some of the sanctuaries in the valley of Polcevera, such as la Madonna di Belvedere, San Clemente, la Madonna della Guardia, and after having heard mass, they scatter themselves over the adjoining fields, where a kind of fair is held ; some adjourn to temporary sheds, others spread on the grass the provisions which they have brought with them, and spend the afternoon in mirth and content ment. Etiquette is banished from those places; groups of handsome females in their white dresses are seen tripping merrily along. In the cool of the evening they return to town in large parties, singing, talking and laughing. He must be sple netic indeed who does not catch some spark of their harmless gaiety. The Genoese dialect is one of the most difficult in Italy for a stranger. Its pronunciation is"], [479, "141 SARDINIAN NAVY. very close and rapid ; it sounds rather harsh, but the fair sex know how to soften it so as to render it graceful and pleasing to the ear. The Genoese curtail most of the terminations of words ; they drop in general the letter r, and commit many other irregularities ; they have preserved, how ever, the Italian ceremonial of addressing in the third person, using, instead of the Tuscan ella the substitute, uscia, which seems to be a corruption of vossignoria, in the same manner as the Sicilian vossia. The Gazzetta di Genova, of wliich two numbers are published weekly, is one of the best written newspapers in Italy. In its limited columns, be sides the political news, it contains often literary articles, theatrical strictures, and poetical ex tracts. Genoa has a commodious lazzaretto, outside of the walls, at the mouth or foce of the torrent Bisagno. Near it is the dock for building men of war. The Sardinian navy consists at present of two fine large frigates, one corvette, and several smaller ships. The King of Sardinia has also docks at Villafranca, near Nice.

COAST OP THE MEDITERRANEAN. I left Genoa on board a Genoese brig of about eighty tons, bound to Naples ; we sailed out of the harbour with a light breeze from the north, which soon after shifted to the east, and we were driven along the western coast beyond Voltri, in spite of our tacking. At last, after beating up all day against the wind, the appearance of the sky threatening us with a gale from the south, we entered the harbour again at night, not without difficulty. The country vessels in the Mediterranean are not sufficiently strong in general to resist a heavy sea for any length of time, and their masters do not like to run too great a distance from the shore, but prefer keeping as much as possible in sight of the land. The sailors, however, especially the Genoese, are well experienced, and acquainted, by long practice, with the different coasts, as well as with the appearances of the weather in these latitudes. In this instance the forebodings of our captain proved true ; as, during the night, a storm arose"], [482, "144 VIEW OF GENOA FROM THE SEA. from the south-east, which, had we been at sea, would have driven us some hundred miles to the westward. The weather continued stormy the \u25a0whole of the next day ; but on the following it cleared up, the sea was becalmed, and we sailed once more with a favourable land breeze, steering our course along the eastern Riviera. As we glided gently through the smooth waves, I took a parting view of the fine scenery we were leaving. The stately buildings of Genoa ; its gay villas ; the two splendid wings of suburbs and villages extending ten or twelve miles on each side, built as it were by enchantment, on a rocky sterile country, and backed by the naked frowning Apen nines with their snowy summits ; an azure sky and a deep blue sea, \u2014 the whole formed such a brilliant prospect, that, although well acquainted with it, I was struck with new-felt admiration. Genoa has that effect upon me, that it preserves the charm of novelty ; and the impressions of pleasure on seeing it, and of regret in quitting it, are always as powerful as they were on my first visit. The glorious display of wealth and magnificence, in the midst of the barren rocks of Liguria, is exclusively the fruit of commerce and industry, reared up by national spirit. What a contrast with the fertile but uncultivated plains of Latium, which present an extensive scene of wilderness and"], [483, ".APPEARANCE OF THE COAST. 145 of gloomy desolation. Genoa needs not envy even the rich decorations of Parthenope ; there is something purer and more bracing in the climate of the former, more romantic and sublime in its scenery; as there is more decency and activity in its men, and more loveliness and gentleness in its women. The numerous and neat cottages scat tered about the mountain slope, with the spires of the parish churches rising in the middle of the different hamlets, have an appearance of domestic comfort, of order, and of pleasing tranquillity, which charms the feelings of the spectator. There are spots where a man, tired of the busy crowd, would fain retire, forgetting the world and its illusions, and devote himself to study and to the contemplation of the works of God. I was ex pressing my admiration at the beauty of the scenery to the Genoese sailors, a plain unsophisticated race of men, and they felt highly gratified by my praises of their country. The sun set in all its glory, and after it had sunk beneath the western waves, the horizon con tinued to glow with the richest orange dye, and the mountains were tinged with a soft purple colour ; a few fleecy clouds were scattered about the azure vault of the sky. We passed the jut ting cape of Portofino, a gentle breeze speeding us along, and the calm waters were rippling against Vol. II. L"], [484, "146 EVENING SERVICE ON BOARD. the vessel. At a signal from the captain, the sailors knelt down on deck, and began the rosary or evening prayers, which they recited with un affected devotion. They sang at the end the litany or hymn to the Virgin ; their simple strains broke through the stillness that prevailed over the vast solitude of the sea, and seemed in unison with the voice of nature, which spoke the glories of the Creator. Such scenes are most impressive, and are well known to travellers who have frequented the Mediterranean. After a frugal supper, which consisted of salt fish and vegetables, one of the crew, a kind of im provvisatore, began to sing with a plaintive melody the affecting ballad of La Bordighiera. The cir cumstances of this sad story took place a few years ago at a village of that name near San Remo, in the Riviera di Ponente. A young man was in love with a girl in his neighbourhood, whose parents were averse to the match. Being obliged to leave his country for a time, he obtained from his mis tress a solemn promise that she would never listen to any other man's addresses. During his ab sence, the poor girl, urged by her relations, was reluctantly prevailed upon to receive the visits of another admirer, and their marriage was nearly concluded when the first lover returned on the wings of hope. He was soon apprized of the"], [485, "TALE OF LA BORDIGHIERA. 147 inconstancy of his fair one, and having brooded upon her infidelity until his passions were worked up to frenzy, he proceeded in the dusk of the evening to her cottage, and finding her sitting with her aged mother, he rushed in, and bit terly upbraiding her for her breach of promise, stabbed her to the heart, after which he ran away to the neighbouring mountains. The unfortunate victim soon expired, and her body was taken on the second day to a solitary chapel, to remain there exposed to view until next morning, when the last service was to be performed for the rest of her soul. The wretched assassin, meantime, wandered about in agitation and despair ; he heard the evening toll of the funeral bell in memory of her whom he had so tenderly beloved and so cruelly sacrificed ; he could bear no longer his excruciating remorse, but ran to the chapel, and bursting open the door, he took a last sight of those well-known features now closed in death, knelt down by the side of the corpse, and, after asking her forgive ness, shot himself through the head. The two lovers were buried together next day.

The aspect of the land along this part of the coast is the wildest that can be imagined. The mountains are dark and de solate ; few traces of cultivation or of habitations are to be seen ; it is the most barren part of the Genoese territories. The inhabitants of the Riviera di Le vante, especially of that part between Chiavari and La Spezia, are much poorer than those of the western coast. Their mountains hardly produce any thing ; the little wine they have is sour ; there are but few olive-trees ; their villages are wretched. This part of the Apennines is called i monti liguri; they are very high, and join the mountains of Parma. The gulf of La Spezia is one of the finest in the Mediterranean, and is an excellent station for fleets. The French were aware of its importance ; they built forts to defend the entrance of the gulf, erected batteries on its shores and on the neighbouring islands, established docks, and in tended to make it one of their great naval stations. Their works have been since neglected, being of no use to the Sardinian government. The village of Lerici, on the eastern side of the gulf, is the place where the feluche from Genoa land tra vellers going to Tuscany. The road, or rather"], [487, "MASSA, CARRARA, AND LUCCA. 149 path, along the eastern Riviera was formerly practicable for mules only ; a new road, however, has been completed from Genoa to La Spezia; the part between Sestri and Sarzana was by far the most difficult, as it was to be cut through mountains almost inaccessible. At Sarzana a fine carriage road begins, and vetturini are stationed there, who take passengers to Pisa for two or three dollars a-head. We passed, during the day, along the coast of Massa and Carrara, a small principality, well known for its fine marbles, and which is now go- verned by the Archduchess Beatrice of Austria. The next state is that of Lucca, formerly a small republic, afterwards given by Napoleon to his sister Eliza, and bestowed since by the Congress of Vienna upon Maria Louisa, Infanta of Spain*. This princess was once Duchess of Parma, and afterwards Queen of Etruria, whence, having been driven out by the French in 1808, she re ceived, at the peace, the principality of Lucca as a compensation.

Next day we were becalmed off Leghorn ; we saw plainly the hills of Montenero above the town. In the evening a stiff breeze arose and car ried us past the shoals of Meloria, which extend very far under water, and on which many vessels have been lost. We passed closer to them than our captain seemed to be aware of, and we saw the breakers on our lee-bow. The calculations of the Mediterranean sailors are in general very inexact ; their maps are defective ; the piloto or scrivano, both which names answer to that of mate, is the only man on board who has studied a little navigation; but all these deficiencies are made up by their long practice of these seas. Another dangerous place in this neighbourhood is that called Le secche di Vada, where are sunken rocks, nearly half way between Leghorn and Piombino ; it seems that a town formerly existed here, which was sunk by an earthquake under the level of the sea, and part of the buildings is still to be seen in calm weather*. * The whole of this interesting coast is so beautifully and so truly described by Tassoni in his Secchia Rapita, canto 10, that I cannot resist the temptation of quoting some of his stanzas.

These alterations are natural and wise ; those parcels of land, under a distant foreign dominion, were obstacles to the welfare of the whole country.

Coming out of the channel, we continued our course along the coast of the M aremme ; this is the general name given to this marshy unhealthy country. The whole western coast of Italy, from the mountains of Genoa to the extremity of Cala bria, a tract of six hundred miles in length, may be considered, with the exception of the Bay of Naples, as one immense maremma, divided into Tuscan, Roman, and Neapolitan. It is in general a low flat country, extending ten, fifteen, and twenty miles in breadth, to the foot of the lower ridges of the A pennines ; intersected by the nu merous rivers and torrents which flow from those mountains, and covered in some places with forests, but mostly -with under-wood, and in other parts opening into immense meadows, in which large herds of cattle are grazing.

The buffalo is originally a native of Asia, but long naturalized in Italy; it is a sullen ferocious animal, and it is dangerous to approach it, as it will run against the intruding stranger, throw him down, and crush him to death with its head and knees. They are Used for dragging heavy-loaded carts, and for towing vessels up the rivers ; of the milk of the female buffalo good cheese is made, and buffalo meat is sold at a lower price than any other. The people who guard the herds of buf- faloes are in general desperate characters, outlaws, and runaways from towns, who cannot return to their homes on account of their misdeeds, and who remain concealed in these solitudes, where every summer many of them find their graves.

The most obvious causes of the unhealthiness of the maremme appear to be : the accumulation of stagnant water, proceeding from the rain, or from the overflowing of the rivers in the wet season, and which is left to exhale during four months of burning heat ; and the great mass of decayed ve getable and animal substances, such as wild plants, leaves of trees, insects, reptiles, 8sC, which, mixed with the water, remain for a long time in a state of putrefaction. The latter cause must be the more powerful, as vegetation is very luxuriant in this rich and untouched soil. The emanations proceeding from the marshes are very strong and offensive to the smell ; the atmosphere has a sopo rific effect ; sleep proves fatal to a stranger, and is the sure means of his catching the fever. The vapours rise in a thick mist over the plain, and the wind blowing gently from the sea during the summer months, spreads them further inland to the foot of the hills ; so that many districts which are not marshy, and even places raised consider ably above the plain, are rendered very unhealthy by it.

Meantime the sky became cloudy, there was a great swell from the south ; the captain seemed afraid of the wind coming to blow from that quarter, as we should then have found ourselves in a very critical situation, close upon a lee-shore, without sea-room to tack. I heard him call out to the helmsman to steer off to the west, should the wind change at all ; I jumped on deck ; the night was extremely dark. Looking at the compass, I perceived we were steering our right course; but our frail vessel was terribly tossed and shaker about by the furious waves. Our Genoese sailors were extremely prompt in lowering the sails; tvo or three minutes after, it would have been too late, the wind would have carried them off; we only kept our fore-top-sail.

The sun rose from behind the lovely hills of Frascati, and by its light we could distinguish the ball which crowns the dome of St. Peter's church. There lies imperial Rome, that ancient mother of heroes, twice the capital of the world, in all times the land of genius, and the theatre of human vicis situdes ! The wilderness which surrounds her suits her awful destinies; she sits in the middle of de solation and ruins, her trophies prostrate in the dust; yet she looks majestic, solemn, and sad.

The modern Romans, although they sink under the weight of the glory of their ancestors, which renders their present condition more humiliating, yet retain some sparks of that ancient spirit which only requires a favourable opportunity to blaze forth again. There is still a certain bold, fierce ness in the character of the Roman peasantry, which is not altogether contemptible. In the narrow lanes of Transtevere, also, many obscure individuals exist, who, under an uncouth exterior, conceal a generous heart, and who dare to be proud of their country. The middling ranks of society at Rome are far more polished in their manners, and better educated, than the corre sponding class at Naples : their language is prover bially elegant. The clergy are in general well informed, and really respectable ; a great number of learned men are to be found among them.

Little or nothing remains now for a traveller to say about Rome. Its monuments, ancient and modern, have been so often described, and by so many superior hands ; they are so generally known through writing, engraving, and painting, that it would be superfluous to say any thing about them. Of the moral features of modern Rome, I have had occasion to speak in the course of this work.

The political and civil government of Rome is, as I have remarked already, peculiar to itself. The papal provinces to the north of the Apen nines are the most healthy, fertile, and industrious ; those bordering on the Mediterranean are un wholesome and desolate. The Roman princes are possessed of immense estates, which, for the most part, are left untilled and serve as pasture lands. The Roman peasantry are fierce and impatient of strict control, being accustomed to live under a weak government, which seldom interferes with private and obscure individuals. The population of the city itself is, in a great measure, amalgamated with, and living upon, the present system; they are retainers of the papal court, of the ecclesiastical dignitaries, monastic communities, and of the nobility. A sudden change would therefore loosen all the links of society, and produce indescribable confusion and misery among the inferior classes. It is very doubtful whether any new form of a mournful delight in perusing that noble poet's earlier effu sions, so well suited to the character and genius of Italy, and shall regret that the mind and the hand which embodied such glowing thoughts should have been laid at rest just when there was within their reach a field worthy of them."], [503, "FRENCH INVASION IN 1803. 165 government would suit the Romans for some ge nerations to come ; the obstacle of localities, cli mate, and habits, are so numerous and so powerful against the introduction of novelty. A complete change of government would strip Rome of all its artificial splendour and remaining wealth, and be followed by the most squalid and appalling misery. This is what happened when the French took pos session of the country in 1809, and reduced Rome to the rank of a provincial town. The population decreased by thousands every year; numbers of respectable families were reduced to beggary ; the streets at night were haunted with unfortunate persons who had seen better days, and now were begging for bread ; the number of people turned out of employment, besides those expelled from the convents, added to the melancholy condition of this unfortunate city. Had this state of things con tinued much longer, Rome would have become a desert.

But then, it will be said, there was on the other side a load of prejudices and vices! These were the necessary consequences of the social system; but the virtues were the fruits of religion, assisted by the disposition of the heart. Of all catholic cities, Rome was known as the most tolerant and the least bigoted. The schools, colleges, and seminaries of Rome, were remarkable for the liberality of their institutions, much greater than it would be imagined by people beyond the Alps. All this I can say of Rome; much more might be added.

Although there is certainly much corruption hi Rome, still an appearance of decency is preserved, preferable to the open licentiousness of Naples and of Venice.

The Sicilian or Neapolitan monarchy consists of the kingdom of Naples and the island of Sicily. It was formerly called the kingdom of the two Sicilies, citra and ultra Pharum, the straits of Messina forming the division between. The pre sent king has united the government of Sicily to that of Naples, and he has assumed, therefore, the title of Ferdinand I., King of the united kingdom of the two Sicilies. He was before styled Ferdi nand IV. of Naples. This kingdom has been, more perhaps than any other, the subject of continual wars between the different nations of Europe. The Norman adven turers early in the twelfth century founded the Sicilian monarchy, by conquering, one after the other, the petty Lombard states of Benevento, Capua, and Salerno, the republics of Naples and Amalfi, and driving the Greeks out of Apulia, and the Saracens from the island of Sicily. The German emperors of the House of Suabia succeeded the Nor mans ; the French princes of the House of Anjou"], [513, "175 VICISSITUDES OF NAPLES. conquered the country over the Suabians; the Ar ragoncse followed the Angevins ; and they in their turn were succeeded by the royal dynasty of Spain, who ruled Naples by Viceroys. The Spanish government in Sicily, Naples, and Lom bardy, from the latter part of the sixteenth century to the beginning of the eighteenth, was what all Spanish delegate governments have been, whether in the Netherlands, in Italy, in Portugal or in America, the most oppressive of all. In the war of succession, Naples was conquered by the Austrians, and at last reconquered again by the Infante Charles Bourbon, afterwards Charles III. of Spain, father of the present King Ferdi nand, and the founder of the reigning Neapolitan dynasty. In our times the kingdom of Naples has con tinued to be the theatre of political vicissitudes. It was conquered by the French republicans in January, 1799; who established there an ill-fated republic, which closed its existence in July of the same year, and the fall of which was sealed by the blood of a number of unfortunate, and many of them well-meaning, though perhaps deluded men. some of whom belonged to the first families of the kingdom. The history of that epoch is a mixture of atrocity, folly, and romantic enterprise. Ferdinand having returned to Naples, retained"], [514, "176 ,80si. SECOND FRENCH INVASION. his kingdom, under the partial guardianship of the French, who occupied for some time part of the kingdom. When the war of 1805 broke out be tween France on one side and Austria and Russia united on the other, the court of Naples thought of making a useful diversion, and Russian and English troops landed at Naples. But the rapid successes of Napoleon in Germany rendered abor tive the plans of the Neapolitan cabinet, which now found itself exposed to all the wrath of the conqueror. Accordingly, early in 1806, General Massena marched upon Naples, and conquered the kingdom, Ferdinand having already embarked for Sicily. The province of Calabria, however, which had not been conquered in the first invasion, made now an obstinate resistance, and a fierce war was carried on for two years in those wild and moun tainous regions, between the French and the Calabrese, which was attended by circumstances of uncommon cruelty and desolation. Meantime Napoleon had appointed his brother Joseph to be King of Naples. Joseph, like all Napoleon's brothers, seemed little calculated for the cares of a kingdom, and especially of a newly conquered kingdom. He was fond of pleasure ; and his ministers, especially Saliceti, were con tinually alarming him with reports of conspiracies, and remonstrating with him upon the necessity of"], [515, "JOSEPH NAPOLEON, AND MURAT. 177 measures of rigour to frighten his indocile subjects into subjection. Accordingly frequent executions took place, both in the capital and in the pro vinces. Still the kingdom was far from quiet. Bands of insurgents, half guerrillas, half robbers, were overrunning the country, and were supported by the court of Sicily, who had possession of Ca pri, Ponza, and other islands on the coast. At last, in 1808, Napoleon having, as he thought, obtained possession of Spain, partly by stratagem and partly by force, destined Joseph for his representative at Madrid under the pompous title of King of Spain and of the Indies. The decree by which he appointed him to his new dignity will remain a lasting memorial of the height to which that extraordinary man had risen, and, at the same time, of the precariousness of all human power.

He had the qualities of a soldier of fortune ; he was brave, frank, and naturally disposed to generosity ; uneducated, but possessed of good sense and penetration ; he was vain of his person, fond of show, magnificence, and pleasure, yet he preserved the manliness of a warrior. Such a man could not fail to recommend himself to the Neapolitans, a people easily dazzled by external appearance and brilliant endowments. Appointed to the throne of Naples just after the short but oppressive reign of Joseph Buonaparte, and of his detested minister Saliceti, Murat ap peared as a deliverer. He flattered the prejudices of the people, listened to their grievances even in the middle of the streets; he showed mercy to many of the discontented who had openly com mitted themselves; he pursued a moderate and conciliatory system in the refractory provinces ; he had a fine army, a brilliant retinue, and an ex pensive household ; in short, had he been inde pendent of his brother-in-law, Napoleon, he might have been the regenerator of this country.

A French military resident was stationed at Naples, as a representative of the French Emperor, to watch all the steps of Murat, and to thwart any measure that might be obnoxious to the sovereign umpire. French officers and greedy employes swarmed in Naples; Murat was obliged to submit, although unwillingly; he had several serious dis putes with his imperial relative, and his consort Caroline went even to Paris to deprecate the wrath of her brother. On his return to Naples after the battle of Leipzig, Murat thought of availing himself of the golden opportunity to be at last a real and not a nominal king. He opened his ports, made friendly proposals to the belligerent powers, and seemed to be sincere in his determination to abandon the continental system, which, he publicly said to the assembled merchants, was not suited to the posi tion and to the interests of the Neapolitan king dom. But he soon after began to show his inca pacity as a statesman : \" Tel brille au second rang qui s' eclipse au premier.\" His policy was crooked and false, both towards his brother-in-law who had been his benefactor, and to the allies who were to be his protectors. In his campaign on the southern bank of tne Po, in N 2"], [518, "180 MURAT'S WAR AGAINST AUSTRIA. 1814, he appeared undecided ; and after the treaty of Paris, instead of being satisfied with the king dom of Naples, he continued to occupy, by force, the province of Ancona, over which he had no claim whatever, and he began to aspire to the sovereignty of all Italy. He roused, thereby, the suspicions of Austria, and the other allied powers, whose good-will it would have been his interest to conciliate ; and when, in the year fol lowing, he made his rash and unjustifiable incur sion in the north of Italy, he found himself sadly deceived in all his ambitious calculations. His proclamation, dated Rimini, March 31, 1815, was turgid, and full of the revolutionary phraseology, but destitute of solid argument. The answer of General Bellegarde was a fit refutation of its captious principles*.

Ferdinand was restored, for the second time, to the throne of Naples. The government continued arbitrary, but mild. The freedom of conversation, upon political subjects, which was remarkable, even in places of public resort of the capital, would have surprised a foreigner who had formed his ideas of absolute monarchies from the specimen of Spain, or even of France under Buonaparte. In this respect, therefore, the government of this country could not be taxed with oppression, and the king certainly kept the word he gave on his last return from Sicily, that he would forgive and forget all past occurrences. Indeed, most of the situations in the civil and military departments, except the very first ones, were filled by persons who had been employed under Murat ; so much so, that the royalists, a3 they called themselves, who had always remained attached to King Fer dinand, in all his vicissitudes, and many of whom had followed him to Sicily, and suffered in their"], [521, "HIS ADMINISTRATION. 183 circumstances on that account, complained now that their services were overlooked, and that the Muratists, which was the name given to their an tagonists, were preferred to them. This system, it was supposed, was intended to conciliate the majority ; how far it had succeeded, time and oppor tunities alone could show. Certain it is, that the king was not so popular as formerly with his old adherents, and particularly with the lower classes, who were, in this country, notoriously attached to the old forms of the monarchy, which, though absolute, left them much individual freedom, more, perhaps, than what is known to exist in representative governments. The greatest subject of complaint against go vernment was, that which is at present repeated in every country of Europe, viz., oppressive tax ation. This evil, however, has certainly been first introduced in Italy by the French conquerors, and the present rulers are reproached for not having diminished it after the restoration. But if one considers the general rise in the prices, and the multitude of people which the governments are obliged to support (another legacy of the French), the question naturally arises, whether it would be political or even possible to lessen the burdens of the nation? However opinions may be divided upon the subject of the required amount of the"], [522, "184 FINANCES. revenues, there is a more general and more plausi ble objection to the distribution of the taxes. The fondiaria, or land-tax, is particularly burdensome, being more than twenty per cent, upon the esti mated yearly income. Great complaints are also made of unfair valuation of the lands in the pro vinces, and of the severity with which the tax is collected. There are persons who have more than one-third of their income absorbed by this oppres sive tax*. The iscrizione and registro, or tax upon contracts, receipts, wills, fye, is also much com plained of, amounting, in some instances, to five and even ten per cent, of the capital. There are, besides, stamp and license duties. The duties of the dogana or custom-house form also a great source of reve- nue ; this department unites both the offices of excise and custom-house. All kinds of provisions pay a duty on entering the town ; and custom house officers are stationed at the barriers for that purpose, who examine closely all carriages that pass, and who have a right to cause persons to step out for search.

The present revenue of the kingdom of Naples is more than triple what it was before the French invasion ; I was, therefore, surprised in reading one day in an English newspaper a bold assertion, that the governments of the Continent had not materially increased their taxes since the revolution. The Chevalier de Medici was at the head of the financial department, and he was looked upon, even by his enemies, to be a man of considerable abilities. He enjoyed the full confidence of his sovereign, and was, in fact, the ruling minister at Naples. He had succeeded in restoring a certain degree of confidence : the finances were said to be in a flourishing state, and government bills and securities circulated freely and without loss. The judicial system of this country, both civil and criminal, affords matter for numerous com plaints ; and although a certain allowance must be made for exaggeration and party spirit, yet it can hardly be doubted by any man at all acquainted with the private concerns of the natives, that a lamentable degree of corruption prevails in some of the courts, and that pure hands and upright hearts are not general qualifications of the members of"], [524, "186 JUDICATURE. the Neapolitan bench, and the Neapolitan bar. This istheoldand chief bane of this country, which has not yet been removed by any political change ; it is a continual source of discontent, of domestic un happiness, and of immorality, and it is ardently to be wished, that the attention of government, during the present season of peace, may be directed to this most essential branch of internal administration. The evil is deeply rooted, and it requires a hand, discriminating and firm at the same time, to effect a gradual and permanent reform. Unfortunately, the administration, after the restoration, seemed to be vacillating ; the laws and regulations were all pro tcmpore. The French codes were still in force, although new ones were daily expected to supersede them. Decrees followed decrees, upon particular points of political economy, abrogating the decisions of former ones. The administration was composed of men of different parties, which prevented that union so desirable in the councils of a monarchy. Such was the state of Naples, when the revolu tion of the 2nd of July, 1820, took place. A squadron of cavalry, with a lieutenant at its head, belonging to a regiment quartered at Nola, near Naples, were the first to declare themselves openly for a constitutional government. They left their station, and took the road to Avellino, the head"], [525, "REVOLUTION OF 1820. 187 quarters of the third military division, which in cluded the provinces of Capitanata and Principato Ultra. They were soon joined by other soldiers, by the militia, and by many of the inhabitants of Nola, Salerno, and other towns in the neighbour hood. Some troops were sent against them from the capital ; but as it was doubtful whether these were not also inclined towards the same cause as their comrades, it was prudently thought proper to avoid hostilities. On the evening of the 5th, General William Pepe, the officer commanding the third military division, who happened to be at Naples, when this movement took place, set off for Avellino, accompanied by a regiment of dragoons, stationed on the out-skirts of the capital, and espoused openly the constitutional cause. This decisive step persuaded the cabinet of Naples that resistance was vain. Accordingly, on the 6th, a proclamation was issued in the king's name, promising to comply with the wish of his subjects, and to proclaim, within eight days, the basis of a representative constitution. What was the origin of this extraordinary event ? There seems no doubt that a great num ber of individuals of the different provinces, and many of them landed proprietors, wished for a change in the system of government, and a modifi-"], [526, "188 SOCIETY OF THE CARBONARI. cation of the taxes, especially of the oppressive fondiaria, or land-tax. The secret society of the Carbonari had existed for several years in the kingdom, even in the time of Murat, and had been at one time persecuted by his ministers, and on that account favoured, as it appears, by those of the then rival court of Palermo. After the return of Ferdinand to Naples, the Carbonari having shown a tendency to a constitutional form of government, were looked upon with a jealous eye by the restored government. Already, in 1817, symptoms of discontent had appeared in the province of Puglia, and especially at Lecce, a con siderable city near the Adriatic. Severe measures were taken to repress these demonstrations. Meantime, the society spread in the other pro vinces, and its adepts were to be found in almost all the municipalities, amongst the authorities, and, above all, in the provincial militia of the kingdom. The town of Salerno was a central point of this secret association. The proclamation of the Spanish constitution at Cadiz, in the beginning of 1820, attracted the attention of the Neapolitan liberals, especially as their country was connected with Spain by old habits and recollections, and by a close relation ship between their respective sovereigns. They, therefore, unfortunately perhaps for the cause of"], [527, "189 SPANISH CONSTITUTION. liberty, having no national model of a free con stitution, determined upon adopting that one just proclaimed in Spain. Unluckily, the constitution of Spain, like that of France in 1792, seems more adapted for some island in the Indian ocean than for an European kingdom. For a monarchy, it is by far too demo cratic; it leaves the executive too weak and powerless ; it destroys the gradations of rank, to which Europe has been accustomed for so many centuries, and with which all her institutions and recollections are connected : considered as a demo cracy, it retains the incumbrances, superfluous in a republic, of an hereditary king, a court, an expen sive civil list, and kingly prerogatives, which are so many difficulties in the way of the sovereign power which is supposed to reside in the nation. Such a government must necessarily clash with the old governments of Europe ; as the executive, with which they must treat in their political intercourse cannot give sufficient guarantee for its acts, and has not. sufficient latitude in its external measures. It seemed, therefore, that the question resolved itself to this : either all Europe must adopt the principles of the Spanish constitution, or be in a state, however disguised, of hostility with the coun try that has adopted it.

But the constitution of Spain was not sufficiently decided or candid either way \u2014 it was not a republic, and it was not a monarchy, although it retained the elements of both in a state of fermentation. This was at least the light in which the constitution of Spain was considered by the monarchical party throughout Europe. Without waiting for the eight days which the king of Naples had taken to deliberate, the Nea politan patriots pointed out the new government of Spain as the fittest for their country, and on the 7th, the king was persuaded to accept the constitution of the Cortes of 1812, which he did by a decree ; appointing, at the same time, his son, Don Francesco, Duke of Calabria, to be Vicar- General of the kingdom. A Neapolitan parliament was assembled, and Sicily was required to send a proportion of mem bers to it.

A Neapolitan expedition was sent against Palermo in September, and after some fighting, and much injury done to that beautiful city, the Palermitans capitulated, but the articles of the capitulation were not ratified by the constitutional government of Naples. The commander of the Neapolitan troops in Sicily, General Florestano Pepe, brother of the one already mentioned, a man of wisdom, in tegrity, and honourable feelings, expressed, in strong language, in a dignified letter to the king, his disappointment, and refused a decoration which had been offered to him, saying, that since \" the promises which he had given out to the Sicilians, in conformity to the orders he had received, had not been observed, he felt himself obliged to re fuse the reward which his majesty would give him, as this refusal was the only means of preserv ing the esteem of the Sicilians, whose generosity and noble confidence in him he could never for get.\" The Sicilian Prince, Villa Franca, who had acted as a conciliator in that affair, also wrote an"], [530, "192 EFFECT OF THE SICILIAN WAR. energetic protest against what he considered as an infraction of the capitulation.

They had, however, an evil effect upon'the constitutional government of Naples, which weakened itself by detaching the Sicilians from its interests ; the Sicilian business tended also to strengthen the suspicion which has existed in all times amongst thinking men, that those who are the most eager in wishing liberty for themselves, are not always the most mindful of the rights of others, and that they, on the contrary, often show an inclination to make every one submit not only to their measures but even to their ideas. While absolute govern ments are satisfied with enforcing obedience, democratic governments wish to force people even to applaud decisions against their better judgment.

The engagement lasted several hours, during which the Neapolitan troops be- haved well, stood the fire, and the Austrian ca- valry was even repulsed in several charges. The Austrians, however, being reinforced, and threa- tening to turn the right of the Neapolitans, General Pepe thought proper to return to his original position, which was extremely strong, and at a short distance from the field of action.

General Pepe had hardly a few hundred men left to guard the pass of Antrodoco, which was forced by the Aus- trians on the 9th, not, however, without meeting"], [533, "195 THE AUSTRIANS ENTER NAPLES. some resistance. General Pepe saw himself, there fore, obliged to leave the city of Aquila on the 10th, and retire with the scanty remains of his corps through Castel Di Sangro and Isernia. On the 17th, he came to Naples, where he proposed a new plan of defence, nearer the capital, but which was not put into execution. Meantime the Austrians pursued their march upon Naples without any further opposition ; the rest of the Neapolitan troops disbanded them selves, except the guards who were supposed to be favourable to the king. The provincial militia were returning to their homes. The king's pro clamations, threatening to consider those who should resist as rebels, frightened the people. The capital was left open; the regent humanely gave permissions and passports to all the officers and deputies who wished to emigrate. On the 24th of March, the Austrian army entered Naples without the least opposition. Twenty-two deputies who had assembled in the hall of parliament, after having waited for the others, being a number insufficient to deliberate, declared that they were obliged to separate on account of this deficiency, and of the presence of the enemy. An hour after this determination, an. armed 02"], [534, "196 CLOSING OF THE PARLIAMENT. force entered the hall, which was closed and sealed by an order from the police. The authority of the king was restored, as it was before the 2d of July, 1820. The kingdom of Naples is undoubtedly one of the finest regions of Europe. Its population, exclu sive of Sicily, amounts to nearly five millions ; the capital alone contains above four hundred thousand inhabitants, and ranks thereby next to London and Paris, as the third city in Europe. The surface of the kingdom includes about twenty-three thou sand square miles. The productions of the soil are as varied as the appearance of the country, and as the character of the different races that in habit it. The vast plains of Puglia produce abundance of corn and a great quantity of wool ; the peninsula of Lecce and that of Calabria abound with oil and fruit; the mountainous regions of Abruzzo afford pasture for numerous herds of cattle; and the provinces of Naples and Salerno unite all these different produces. A greater va riety of excellent wines is made in this country than in any other of the same extent. The imme diate neighbourhood of Naples alone produces ten or twelve sorts of fine wines, such as Lagrima, Capri, Ischia, Procida, Gragnano, Piedemonte, Vino greco, &c. Besides these, most of the pro-"], [535, "PROVINCES OF THE KINGDOM. 197 vinces of the kingdom abound also with excellent wine. Calabria produces a large quantity of raw silk, which forms an important article of trade. The kingdom of Naples, therefore, notwithstand ing the low state of agriculture and industry, is able, not only to supply the wants of its popula tion, but also to export a considerable surplus, which is exchanged for articles of foreign manu factures. If from the country we proceed to examine its inhabitants, we find among them a remarkable difference of appearance and manners. The moun taineer of Abruzzo, in his course woollen capote or wrapped up in sheep's skin, tending his flocks on the cloudy Apennines, used to a wild nature, to the noise of the torrent and the raging storm, and inured to the privations of a severe winter, retains much of the pastoral simplicity; like all mountaineers, he is attached to his country, to his government, and to his religion. The Abruzzese insurgents made an obstinate resistance on the French invasion. The people of Abruzzo pride themselves in being the descendants of the ancient Samnites, and are still reckoned the best soldiers in the kingdom. Abruzzo is a very interesting country for a stranger to visit, although little known, being: remote from the main roads; its scenery is grand and picturesque ; there is little"], [536, "198 ABRUZZO AND PUGLIA. danger to be apprehended from banditti in those regions; the inhabitants are good natured and hospitable. The province of Abruzzo contains some considerable towns, such as Aquila, Chieti, Teramo, Sulmona, (the birth-place of Ovid), Popoli, and the fortress of Pescara. Several rivers rise in its mountains, and empty themselves into the Adriatic; the principal ones are the Tronto, Sangro, Pescara, &c. Next to Abruzzo is Puglia, the richest of the grand divisions of the kingdom; its principal town is Foggia, which ranks immediately after Naples. It is a new city, built in the middle of the immense plain called II Tavoliere, which renders it very hot and rather unhealthy in summer ; many of the provincial no bility and wealthy landholders reside in it, and live in a style of affluence and even luxury. Pro ceeding farther towards the Adriatic, one enters that part of Puglia called Pietrosa or \"stony;\" the chief produce of which is oil. A succession of considerable towns, at a short distance from one another, line the shore of the Adriatic sea on this side, viz., Manfredonia, a commercial place with a good harbour ; Barletta, also a large town ; Trani ; Bisceglia ; Bari, celebrated for the shrine of St. Nicholas; Monopoli; Brindisi, afamoushar bour in ancient times ; Lecce, one of the most con siderable towns of the kingdom, and whose inha-"], [537, "199 PEOPLE OF PUGLIA. bitants are remarkably ingenious and spirited ; Otranto, once a town of some note, only fifty miles from the opposite coast of Greece, and little more from the island of Corfu ; then turning round the Cape of Leuca, you meet Gallipoli, the prin cipal commercial town in this part of Italy; and farther on, Taranto, a bishop's see. From this enumeration it will be seen that Puglia is a country well inhabited and in a flourishing state. The Pugliesi, or people of Puglia, are the weal thiest, and the most civilized, of the Neapolitan pro vincials. They are shrewd, quick, and intelligent. A great number of their youth come to the capital to pursue their studies ; many of them apply them selves to the learned professions, in which they generally succeed; and they often attain the high est stations, in preference to the indolent and luxurious natives of the capital. In the mari time districts of Puglia there is a mixture of foreign races, Greeks, Albanians, and Sarrazins ; in several villages they still retain the original dress, and speak the language of their forefathers: the Greeks are chiefly to be found in the province of Lecce, and the Albanians farther north, to wards the frontiers of Abruzzo. Puglia was for several years after the restoration in a disturbed state ; numerous bands of insurgents infested that province; they were rather above common"], [538, "200 BANDS OF ROBBERS. robbers ; something of a political spirit appeared to be mixed with their love of plunder. The most famous among these bands was that of Gaetano di Martino and his brothers, better known under the name of i Vardarelli ; they were at one time so formidable, that the Neapolitan government thought proper to enter into terms of accommoda tion with them, by which their followers were organized into a regular troop, received pay from the state, and were even intrusted with the care of defending the country against the other bands. For some months after the Vardarelli were faith ful to their engagements, but their chief, Gaetano, having trespassed beyond the limits of his jurisdic tion, proceeded to a village called Ururi, inhabited by Albanians, where he demanded, in a summary manner, a supply of provisions; a scuffle ensued, in which Gaetano and several of his followers lost their lives, and the rest of his band were soon after, under some pretence, enticed to Foggia, where, being surrounded by the regular troops, they were all destroyed or taken. The third grand division of the kingdom of Naples is known by the general name of Calabria ; but it is subdivided, like the others, in various provinces, having each its intendente, or civil governor. The principal towns of Calabria are, Potenza, Cosenza, Catanzaro, Monte-leone, and"], [539, "201 CALABRIA. Reggio. Calabria is by far the wildest part of this kingdom; some of its remote districts, parti cularly those bordering on the Adratic sea, al though within two hundred miles of Naples, are as little known to the inhabitants of the capital as the regions of Albania or Morea; the province of Basilicata is considered as a sort of Tombuctoo, even at Naples. This is owing chiefly to the want of roads and the means of conveyance, and to the low state of commerce and industry. An English man can hardly form an idea of the difficulties and dangers attending a journey through the interior parts of this country ; the few couriers and pro cacci which run between the capital and some of the principal towns of the kingdom, are most wretched vehicles, and appear so, even to per sons used to French diligences, and to the vet turini of northern Italy. The Calabrese, a people to the name of whom unfavourable impressions are commonly attached, are yet possessed of many excellent qualities ; they are brave, constant, full of fire and energy; they make the best friends, but also the bitterest ene mies. Kind treatment will bind for ever the heart of a Calabrese, and their attachment can be depended upon under the most trying circum stances.

The peasantry are as yet in a half-savage state, and the calamities which have visited their country during the last thirty years, such as earthquakes, foreign inva sions, and civil wars, have not tended to improve their condition. The French armies, particularly under the reign of Joseph Bonaparte, behaved with the greatest cruelty towards the unfortunate Calabrese; they burnt half of their villages, cut down their plantations, and seemed to follow that ruthless principle, \" That it is better to rule over deserts, than over a disaffected population.\" A good deal of information is spread among the mid dling classes, and Calabria has produced several men of genius and learning. Terra di Lavoro is the general name of the fourth grand division of the kingdom, which lies between the Apennines and the Mediterranean sea, and extends from the frontiers of the Roman states to the borders of Calabria. Naples, Salerno, Avellino, and Capua, are the principal towns in it. Benevento, although enclosed within the Nea politan territories, belongs to the Pope. The island of Sicily, which had always formed a separate kingdom, having its own parliament, civil government, and laws, although often under"], [541, "203 SICILY. the same sovereign as Naples, has of late under gone a great political change. The king, since his return to his capital, has united the two king doms under the same government, and assumed the title of Ferdinand I., King of the united kingdom of the two Sicilies. This peremptory measure may ultimately be productive of some good to both countries ; for the present it has se verely wounded the feelings of the Sicilians, and especially those of the barons or upper nobility, who derive their titles, and remains of feudal rights, from the Norman conquest of Roger, and many of whom are wealthy and have great influ ence over the peasantry. The Sicilians are a race very distinct from those who inhabit the kingdom of Naples, and among whom they resemble more their neighbours, the Calabrese, than any other ; they have an old and deep-rooted antipathy against the Neapolitans ; they are warm and high minded, shrewd and quick-sighted, but irritable and tenacious. The upper classes are splendid even to prodigality, hospitable to strangers, and polished in their manners. A very great corruption and looseness of morals prevail in the principal towns, but much simplicity of manners is still to be found among the inhabitants of the interior. The Sicilian women are generally handsome and very fascina ting; they are fond of music and of pleasure, but"], [542, "204 SICILIANS. they are also spirited and intelligent, and suscep tible of high feelings. The peasantry are mostly poor; the nobility and clergy being possessed of the greatest part of the lands. The present Sicilians are chiefly descended from the Greeks and the Sarrazins, mixed with the Normans and Spaniards. Some villages are called Sarrazins; others, about Iaci, Greeks ; the inhabi tants of one city in the centre, Sperlinga, are sup supposed to be mostly of French extraction, as it was the only town that would not take a part in the massacre of the French. A difference of races is still observable among the Sicilians ; the complex ions of some are quite fair, while others are as dark as the neighbouring Africans. In some districts on the eastern coast, about Catania, the inhabitants speak a dialect of the Greek. The island of Sicily includes a surface of about eight thousand square miles, and its population is calculated at one million and a half, of which the city of Paler mo contains nearly two hundred thousand ; Messina, Catania, and Trapani, are the other principal towns in the island. The fertility of Sicily has been in all times celebrated; but the little encou ragement given to industry \u2014 the total want of roads between the different parts of the island \u2014 and the spirit of disunion which unfortunately ex ists between the inhabitants of various towns, prevent the Sicilians from reaping the full benefit"], [543, "205 SICILIANS. of those advantages which nature has lavished upon their country. Much good might be done in Sicily by a provident and enlightened system of government, but the good will of the natives must be first secured; their recollections and their pre judices must not be trifled with. The annals of Sicily afford sufficient proofs of their determined spirit. To this day, the account of the Sicilian vespers is early related by parents to their children. The English, during their late military occupa tion of Sicily, had succeeded in conciliating the friendship of most of the natives ; who, even at pre sent, speak of them with expressions of attachment and esteem, which form a striking contrast with the illiberal spirit and envious feelings that are so frequently shown in other countries of Europe towards England. The brief account I have just given of the king dom of Naples and of Sicily, will, I hope, convey a general idea of its present state, and of the im provements these countries are susceptible of. Much more might be said on the subject, but the limits of this work, and its professed purpose, do not allow me to extend further at present. The population of the kingdom of the two Sicilies is above six millions, of which the island of Sicily contains one and a half.

ISLANDS OP THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA, AND COAST OF PROVENCE. I left Naples on board a French brigantine bound to Marseilles. As we sailed through the bay, the sun gradually arose from behind Vesuvius, and illuminated the magnificent landscape I was be holding for the last time. Parthenope and its gay buildings emerged from obscurity in all the pomp of Italian scenery. The gilded dome and the pointed spire, the lofty palace and the wide-spread ing terrace, each appeared in succession : the lovely hills of Vomero and Posilipo, adorned with their numerous white-walled casini intermixed with poplars, Willows, and fruit-trees ; higher up, the castle of St. Elmo, exhibiting its gray walls and battlements, which formed a contrast with the modern appearance of the adjoining Carthusian con vent of San Martino ; Camaldoli rearing from be hind its solitary head, crowned with a few pine trees ; and the hill of Capo di Monte displaying the massive structure under which it groans. A the foot of this range of hills, Naples lay spreading itself widely along the embosomed sea, and stretch-"], [546, "208 PARTING VIEW OF NAPLES. ino- one arm to the neighbouring; town of Portici. The giant shape of Vesuvius rose in opposition to the charming prospect, and the mountainous coast of Castellamare and Sorento, still plunged in obscurity, added to the effect. To the south, the rugged rocks of Capri, and farther west the pyra midical mountain of Ischia, closed the brilliant view. A gentle breeze played \" O'er the glad waters of the dark blue sea ;\" the sky was pure, only here and there some fleecy clouds relieved with their white stripes the bright azure. Such was the aspect of that fine country, when I bade it farewell, perhaps for ever ! Mean time a stiff breeze sprung up and soon wafted us beyond Cape Miseno ; we entered the straits be tween Ischia and Procida ; and Naples, its palaces, its beauties, had fled from our sight ; Vesuvius alone still reared its dusky shape from afar, frowning upon us; \u2014 the first, the last beacon of that far-famed land. We soon passed the islands of Ventotene and Ponza, which are used as pre sidj or places of exile, chiefly for state prisoners. The latter has a very good harbour, into which I was once driven, some years ago, during the late war.

It appeared to me a most miserable abode, and the wretched looks of the prisoners I saw agreed with that appearance ; still theirs was happiness in comparison with the fate of some who were thrown into damp dungeons cut into the rock under the level of the sea ; for such exist both at Ventotene, and at Maretimo, another presidio on the coast of Sicily. Ponza was also a place of ren- dezvous for the partisans and emissaries of the old dynasty ; there plots were formed and expeditions assembled against the French rulers of Naples; the vicinity of the continent rendering that spot peculiarly convenient for the purpose, as boats could cross in a few hours during the night to and from the opposite shore. At one time communica- tions were kept therefrom with the insurgents of the mountains of Sperlonga and Itri, at the head of whom was the famous Fra Diavolo, and with the garrison of Gaeta, when that place was still in the hands of King Ferdinand's forces under the command of Prince Hesse Philipstadt.

The well known Prince of Canosa was for some time at Ponza at the head of a royalist band. The pos session of this island will always be of importance to any power at war with the Neapolitan states, on account of its situation, natural strength, and safe harbour. The wind increased during the day and follow ing night to a strong gale, blowing from the south west, or lebeccio, which is the dread of all Me diterranean sailors on that coast, as it blows them directly on shore, and is always accompanied by a great swell. The coast of Italy from the Genoese territories to the furthermost point of Calabria, an extent of about six hundred miles, has very few safe harbours ; between Gaeta and Civita Vecchia there is none at all, and the sea is very shallow for several miles off the land, which cir cumstances render the Spiaggia Romana, as it is called, a very dangerous neighbourhood, particu larly for the frail country vessels, which are not able to live long against the wind and sea.

The gale lasted with the same violence for another day and night, accom- panied with frequent rain and thunder, the sea running very high and frequently washing over the deck; notwithstanding which, the master, a hardy Provencal, never left it during all the time.

We were then in sight of Monte Argentaro : we saw farther off the island of Monte Cristo, a dreary uninhabited mountain in the middle of the sea, half way between Corsica and Italy; before us we had the fine island of Giglio, belonging to Tuscany, and the solitary rock of Gianuti, once the resort and the watering-place of the Barbary corsairs, who were the terror of these seas. We passed off the western extremity of Elba, where the village of Marciana is situated. In the after noon we were off the island of Capraja, and steered our course between it and Corsica, the lofty mountains of which appeared in view. The little island of Capraja belongs now to the King of Sar dinia, a kind of outpost to his continental states. He keeps in it a garrison composed of a detach ment furnished by one of the regiments at Genoa, and relieved every six months. It must be a real exile for the poor officers, the place being nothing but a barren rock ; the inhabitants are all either fishermen or sailors ; the women cultivate what little soil there is.

Corsica wears a gloomy, forbidding aspect ; wild as the mind, and stern as the heart of its in- habitants ; but like them it is highly susceptible of improvement, and worthy of a better fate. The Corsicans are independent and free like the air of their native mountains ; bold, aspiring, and brave : a man of genius might make them what the Spar- tans once were. Under a succession of weak foreign rulers, their ambition necessarily turned to craft, their courage to ferocity, their inde- pendence to idleness. This island, one hundred miles in length and fifty in breadth, does not contain three hundred thousand inhabitants, a po- pulation hardly double that of the small island of Malta. And yet even such a scanty population, thinly dispersed on a large extent of ground, cannot remain at peace ; but deadly feuds and bloody quarrels continually originate between village and village, between families, and between man and man: hatred revels, and revenge gluts it self, in that ill-fated land.

The widow treasures up the bloody shirt of her lost consort, to show it to her young offspring, when arrived at the age of appreciating the dictates of filial duly which those fatal stains are intended to convey. A hasty word, a spiteful or contemp tuous look, are often sufficient to ensure destruc tion ; and a well-aimed shot pierces the breast of the imprudent victim before he has time to be aware of his danger. The people in the country go about armed with daggers, and a musket on the shoulder, equally ready for attack or defence. Such has been for ages past the state of Corsica.

The Corsicans although proud of their countryman Napoleon were never very affectionate to him ; and, during the period of his power, he had, perhaps, less partisans among his countrvmen in proportion to their numbers, than among any other people subordinate to his sway. They complain of his having totally neglected his native country, and that he did not cause even a good road to be constructed to communicate through the different parts of the island. The soil in Corsica is good, but poorly cultivated ; and owing to the difficulty of communications, the scarcity of hands, and the absence of commerce, landed property is worth very little, and the land holder gets scarcely any thing beyond the supply of the primitive necessaries of life.

In many appa rently insignificant places on this coast, like Al benga, Lingueglia, San Remo, Porto Maurizio,i$-c, there are mercantile houses which send ships to the Black Sea, to Egypt, and to Lisbon, and which have established factories in various ports of the Mediterranean. The Genoese have now lost their independence, but they have got some compensa tion in the freedom of their flag, which now flies over the seas, respected by the Barbary powers ; thanks to English protection and interference. We passed Monaco, a small principality, the sovereign of which is subordinate to the King- of Sardinia. He was deprived of his dominions by Napoleon, who did not disdain such an humble prey in the midst of his gigantic aggressions ! Now the Prince of Monaco is restored to his do minions. We saw the Col de Tende, over which runs the road from Nice into Piedmont, an im portant passage, as it leads from the coast over the Ligurian Apennines at once into the plains of Piedmont and the heart of Italy. It was strongly fortified, and well defended by the Piedmontese troops, at the beginning of the revolutionary war; the French did not attempt to force it, but pre ferred the more eastern pass above Savona, by Millesimo and Montenotte. We passed in the night before Nice and Villafranca. The Comte de"], [560, "222 COUNTY OF NICE. Nice, of which the King of Sardinia is the sove reign, is enclosed between the mountains and the sea, and divided from France by the river Var. It is a delightful region, sheltered from the northern blast, and open to the beneficial influ ence of the south. The lemon, orange, and other fruit-trees, grow there luxuriously. Nice was renowned as a place of resort for consumptive and other invalids, as most beneficial to their health ; it is not, however, so much frequented now by the English as it was formerly : the neigh bourhoods of Genoa, Pisa, and Naples offering to them the same advantages, united to greater re sources for society and amusement. The inha bitants of Nice, like those of Savoy, although they have been submitted to an Italian sovereign for centuries, are still more French than Italian. Their language is a patois, somewhat resembling the Provencal, a mixture of bad French and bad Italian ; the manners and the character of the in habitants are French. We made little progress through the night, owing to the scarcity of the wind ; and next morn ing we found ourselves, at last, off the coast of France, and we saw behind us the last land of Italy quickly retiring from our sight, enveloped in a dark mist. We were then off the gulf of Frejus, and the towns of St. Tropez and Cannes,"], [561, "223 COAST OF PROVENCE. three memorable places in modern history. Frejus is the place were Bonaparte landed on his return from Egypt, when he came to overthrow the Di rectory, and to assume the supreme power. St. Tropez is the port where, after his abdication at Fontainebleau, in 1814, he embarked on board an English frigate to proceed to Elba ; and at Cannes he landed again the year following, to carry war and desolation anew to France and Europe. What scenes and changes this single man has brought forth into the world ! The coast of Provence, particularly beyond the gulph of Frejus, is far from being agreeable to the view ; it is a barren rugged shore, consisting of chalky rocks, all the way to Marseilles. I saw nothing of the boasted fertility of Provence, and found it very inferior to the delightful Riviera di Ponente, which we had just left. We passed be tween the islands of Hyeres, and the town of that name, on the main land. These islands were strongly fortified with redoubts and other works, by Bonaparte, during the last war, to prevent the English from landing there, as that was the station of the British fleet blockading Toulon. There is a good anchoring place between the islands and the main land. The works on the island of Hyeres are now abandoned, and dis mantled of their cannon. We passed Toulon in"], [562, "224 GULF OF MARSEILLES. the night. As we went by these celebrated roads, I reflected on the gallantry and perseverance of the English sailors, in remaining for years, buffeted by the winds and waves, on an enemy's coast, and on the privations and toils they must have under gone. I do not think any other sailors in the world could have borne half so much. Constancy in enterprise seems to me the peculiar merit of the English. Next day we were off Cape Sicio, but made little or no progress beyond it, owing to the light and variable winds. The appearance of the land continued as barren as before. We were becalmed in the night, and had our ship towed by the long boat. Early next morning we found ourselves in the gulf of Marseilles ; when all on a sudden the wind rose from the land, and it was with difficulty that our men succeeded in getting the vessel into the harbour, where we anchored at last at eight o'clock. Our captain was so angry at the repeated disappointments we had experienced in our voyage, from the wind, that he swore a big Provencal oath, that one of my companions (an honest and quiet, but reserved man,) had brought us ill luck. By the by, this is a superstition very common amongst Mediterranean sailors. As soon as we entered the harbour, we were visited by the quarantine boat, which came alongside, having an"], [563, "225 CITY OF MARSEILLES health officer and a physician on board; they looked at us attentively ; the ship's papers were sent on shore to be smoked ; after which a guard was sent on board, and we were ordered to remain under quarantine for seven days. Marseilles is a very fine city ; the streets are broad and well paved ; most of them run in a straight line, intersecting each other at right an gles ; the houses are uniformly and neatly built, but they have not the shining whiteness of Italian buildings; the regularity of the plan of Marseilles reminded me of Turin, the only specimen of the kind in Italy. It is a place of great trade, and is singularly favoured by its position ; it is the prin cipal harbour of France in the Mediterranean, (Toulon being exclusively appropriated to the royal navy,) situated in a central point of the coast, within a few days sail of Spain, Italy, and Africa. Marseilles is the key of the commerce of France with those countries, as well as with the Levant. Of late it has also carried on a considerable trade with the French West India islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe ; it is also a market for Ame rican, English, and northern vessels, which import colonial produce, and other articles that are allowed to be introduced into France. Marseilles has also some considerable manufactures of soap, in which is consumed a great quantity of inferior Vol. H. Q"], [564, "226 QUARANTINE REGULATIONS. oil, imported for that purpose from Puglia, Mo rea, and the Greek islands. English manufactures are either excluded, or subject to such heavy duties by the French tariff, as to amount to an entire prohibition ; and the custom-house officers are very particular in searching the baggage of travellers on landing on the quay. The quarantine laws are very strict ; they have been so ever since the dreadful plague, which nearly annihilated the population about a century ago, and of which they preserve an historical painting in the health-office. Ships coming from a place with foul bills of health are not allowed to enter the harbour ; but they are sent to perform their quarantine on the opposite island of Chateau d' If, which is situated in the middle of the Gulf of Marseilles. There are lazarettos, with accommodations for the passen gers, and also warehouses for the expurgation of goods. The produce of the quarantine duties is farmed to a company ; notwithstanding which, great impartiality, regularity, and exactness seem to prevail, as all the measures are taken under the inspection of a board of health, and the superin tendence of government. Of all the health officers in the Mediterranean, those of Marseilles and Leghorn are reckoned the strictest and most effec tual in their regulations to prevent the communi cation of contagious diseases. Although I highly"], [565, "QUARANTINE REGULATIONS. 227 approve of these beneficial restrictions, and wish they were adopted in every country, I cannot but animadvert on some of those measures which, under the appearance of care for the public health, seem only calculated to levy a tax on the navigators, and obstruct the communications and commercial intercourse bet-ween the different countries border ing on the Mediterranean. Why, for instance, subject to seven, ten, and sometimes twelve days' quarantine, vessels from different ports of Italy, where it is known that not the smallest suspicion of plague exists ? Such is the practice, however, in the harbours of France, with regard to vessels coming from Italy, and also in all the Italian ports, with regard to vessels coming either from France, or even from any part of Italy out of the territories of their immediate governments. A vessel from Leghorn, Civita Vecchia, and Porto d'Anzio, on its arrival at Naples, is put under seven days' quarantine, and vice versa ; likewise a vessel from the Tuscan or Genoese coasts undergoes the same restrictions in en tering the harbour of Marseilles, although the post goes in a day or two from one to the other of those places. Travellers, therefore, may come by land, without interruption, in as short a time as vessels usually take ; so that of two per sons who set off at the same time for the same Q2"], [566, "228 QUARANTINE REGULATIONS. place, one by land and the other by sea, the one is freely ranging ashore, while the other is con- fined for seven days on board of his vessel. Be- sides, supposing that any degree of danger really existed, these measures would be ineffectual, as the period of quarantine is too short to allow the disease, in its general course, to develope itself; and the precautions taken to prevent communication between one vessel and another are often so very remiss, as to mock the purpose of the restriction. Vessels under short quarantine, or observation, as it is called, lie in the harbour close to one another, so that their cordages, sails, and sides, often touch ; cats, dogs, fowls, run and fly from one to the other freely ; and at night it is very easy for the crews to communicate if they choose, while the guards on board are sound asleep under deck ; so that the vessel which goes out of quarantine to-day may have had intercourse with the one which arrived yesterday. I can see nothing real in all this but the fees paid by the owners of the vessel and cargo to the health-office, the salary given to the guard on board, the high charges for smoking letters sent on shore, and for receiving any thing while under quarantine. But these are the least in conveniences attending this practice : the real mis chief consists in the delay which it occasions to the ship and cargo, and which is often longer than the"], [567, "229 HARBOUR OF MARSEILLES. time spent in the voyage ; so that a vessel trading in the Mediterranean loses at least one-third of the year in quarantines. It is strange that the different governments of Italy and France do not come to a proper understanding on the subject, and to the reform of a system, which disheartens the traders, and often ruins the owners of small ves sels, who are generally possessed of very scanty capitals. One would almost think retaliation to be a leading motive in the adoption of these mea sures, for they regulate the quarantine of vessels by that which is observed in the country they come from. The government of Naples carries the matter so far, as to oblige vessels to and from various provinces of its own kingdom to perform quarantine ; although, I am informed, it is enforced with no great care except in the capital. The harbour of Marseilles is very spacious, and one of the safest in the Mediterranean ; its en trance is so narrow, that the most violent storms cannot ruffle the calm of its waters, being also protected from southern winds by a high hill ; but its advantages are not unattended with incon veniences, as the water is not renovated by the sea running into it ; and, as there are no tides in the Mediterranean, the harbour gets filled with the filth from the vessels and from the town, and becomes like a stagnant pool ; the offensive"], [568, "230 APPEARANCE OF MARSEILLES smell proceeding from it cannot but be productive of unhealthiness to the town, particularly in sum mer, although they clean it from time to time. There is a dry dock for the construction of vessels, chiefly brigs, schooners, and smaller craft. The Provencals are good Mediterranean sailors, but not equal to their French brethren on the Atlantic. While we were in quarantine I saw some large vessels coming in, belonging to Nantes, Havre de Grace, l'Orient, and other ports of the north of France ; they were remarkably fine ships, rigged nearly the same as the English, and unlike the vessels built in the south. The old town of Marseilles lies on the point north of the harbour, and is irregularly built, like other ancient cities; but the modern town, which spreads to the east and south, is one of the finest I have seen. The principal street is the Cours, running from the Porte d'Aix, or northern gate, to the southern gate, or Porte de Rome, as it is called ; a high-sounding name, which it is rather striking to find at such a distance from that famed city, but which still reminds us of its former power and influence. Marseilles is an open town; the castle of St. Nicholas, which stands on a hill commanding the harbour, was destroyed during the revolution, and has not been repaired since. It is almost a heap of ruins. It seems strange that"], [569, "231 PEOPLE OF MARSEILLES. Bonaparte should have left such a populous and important place as Marseilles without a fortress to overawe and defend it. The lighthouse, with a small fort adjoining it, lies on the opposite or northern side of the harbour. After the first fanaticism of the revolution, in which the popu- lace of Marseilles acted such a conspicuous part, had subsided, (if, indeed, they may be called Mar- seillois, who were a mixture of wretches from all parts of the south of France, and of the neigh- bouring provinces of Italy,) the people of Mar- seilles being wholly addicted to maritime trade, from which they derive their subsistence and wealth, could not be friendly to Bonaparte's ad- ministration, and he was well aware of it ; he showed no affection for them, and threatened even to fill up their harbour. At the first restoration of the Bourbons, the Marseillois were eager to show their royalism ; and if the national guards of that city had been allowed to march against Bona- parte at his return from Elba in March 1815, they would probably have effectually stopped his progress before he could reach Lyons, whereby France and Europe would have been spared the disasters of another war ; but they were detained so lono-, for some reason or other, that when at last they were allowed to proceed, it was too late. After"], [570, "232 POLITICAL DISTURBANCES. the battle of Waterloo, an expedition from Genoa, composed of English and Piedmontese troops, landed at Marseilles without any resistance, and took possession of the place in the name of Louis XVIII. ; they were received by the inhabitants with demonstrations of joy, and a few months after, when tranquillity was restored to France, the town was given up to the king's officers. The Marseillois, and, generally speaking, the inhabit ants of Provence, showed themselves attached to the Bourbons at the restoration. At that epoch some acts of popular revenge took place against several obnoxious persons, who had been in em ployment under Bonaparte ; but they were few compared to those wliich happened in Languedoc and other provinces of France. The Mamelukes, a body of Egyptians who had followed the French on their return from that country, and who were stationed at Marseilles, were particularly marked out as the victims of the popular fury, which they had drawn upon themselves by their overbearing and insolent behaviour in the time of their power. Many of them were killed ; and the fate of one of their women, a black, was peculiarly distressing : with the obstinate and stupid fanaticism of an African, she continued to cry Vive FEmpereur, while all around her were in revolt against that name, and she would never submit to be silent."], [571, "233 POLICE REGULATIONS. Surrounded and ill-treated by the enraged popu lace, she threw herself into the sea, probably with the intention of swimming across the harbour, but while in the water she was aimed at and shot by one of the mob, and her body drawn ashore amidst imprecations. The respectable citizens, however, assembled in the ranks of the national guard, and soon succeeded in restoring order ; and those of the fallen party who were prudent enough to con ceal themselves during the first explosion, are now peaceably living in Marseilles. The merchants of this town have been for some time in hopes of having it declared port franc, in the same way as Leghorn is, but for some reason or other their ex pectations have not yet been realized. On landing at Marseilles our passports were taken to the police, and sent to the minister at Paris. Meantime they gave us a temporary French pass, to proceed to the capital. This formality is observed with every stranger who enters France for the first time. I must observe, that, although it took us a whole day to have the business settled, having to call at three or four different places, still the whole trans action was accompanied with a great share of that old French urbanity of manners which I have not always found amongst Frenchmen of the modern school. Before I quitted Marseilles, I went with two of"], [572, "234 NOTRE DAME DE LA GARDE. my fellow-travellers to visit an ancient church, called Notre Dame de la Garde, from an image of the Virgin Mary, which is reckoned miraculous ; it is situated on a high hill, to the south-east of the town, commanding the country around ; it has the appearance of an ancient castle, surrounded by Mralls and battlements. While we were lying in the harbour, I had seen crowds of people ascend- ing to it in the morning, and my curiosity was awakened by it. We went up a steep path, which, at a certain height, is converted into a flight of steps hewn in the rock, and we arrived at last at a small platform before the portal of the building, where we enjoyed a very fine and extensive coup d'\u0153il. We had a bird's-eye view of the town and harbour of Marseilles; we could trace the prin- cipal streets and buildings ; we saw the gulf, and the open sea beyond the island of Chateau d'lf ; and all the flat naked country around Mar- seilles lay spread before us, surrounded at a dis- tance by barren hills. The whitish colour of the rock gives to the whole a resemblance to the island of Malta. We saw many bastides, or small country houses, with gardens and orchards enclosed by stone walls, the Sunday retreat of wealthy citizens; but they are not sufficient to enliven the cheerless prospect of the country, which, in my opinion, even the splendid appearance of the town cannot"], [573, "VIEW OF THE COUNTRY. 235 overbalance. I, who had just come from the lux- uriant regions of Campagna Felice, thought I could never reconcile myself to live in such a dreary spot, which appeared to me like a sunburnt African waste ; still I can easily conceive how the good citizens of Marseilles, accustomed to it, and wholly intent upon commercial pursuits, can live happy and comfortable during six days of the week in their commodious town-houses, and then, on a Sunday, enjoy as a great luxury the shade of a few orange and lemon trees, and the quiet re- treat of their walled bastides. We entered Notre Dame de la Garde by passing over a small draw- bridge, and at the end of a low corridor we found a small and dark chapel, shut by an iron balus- trade. We could scarcely see, by the faint glim- mering of a lamp, the ex volo offerings of the devotees, covering the walls, as marks of thank- fulness for favours received from the blessed Virgin. I have seen so many of these displays in Italy, and other Catholic countries, and heard so many stories about them, that I cannot help saying here a few words on the subject. I have heard men, who thought themselves wise, rave against the superstition, or laugh at the ignorance of the poor deluded people of Catholic countries, while I felt more inclined to compassionate and respect the weakness of afflicted humanity, which, for-"], [574, "236 EX VOTO OFFERINGS. saken by the world, turns for assistance to those patrons whom faith has placed in heaven, near the throne of the All-merciful. The practice of making offerings to the Divinity is of great antiquity, and seems natural to the human mind- Some nations thought their gods did really con sume the holocausts; others, less ignorant, allotted them to the use of the servants of the temple ; in more enlightened ages the ex votos have been used neither for the one nor for the other of these purposes, but they have been intended as a sacri fice of a small portion of the wealth of the person benefited, showing a spirit of mortification and humility, and a readiness to resign those worldly goods, which are but a gift of the Almighty giver of all things. The faith that some people had in the efficacy of their prayers and offerings pro bably often assisted in favouring a crisis in a sickly constitution ; while even to those whose cases were beyond cure, it afforded some consola tory gleams of hope,, which cheered at least the last moments of their earthly sufferings. And are these benefits to be torn by a rude hand from the sick, the lame, the blind, and from all the other children of misfortune and sorrow ? Can Pro vidence be displeased at their heartfelt supplica tions and humble offerings ? There is something no sacred in misfortune and religion united, that"], [575, "237 EX V0T0 OFFERINGS. we ought to be careful how we tread upon that holy ground, lest we render the sufferings of the devoted victim more acute, by bereaving it of those hopes and consolations which, even if illusory, are not the less beneficial in alleviating sorrow, and in softening the pillow of sickness and agony. Until we have done something more for the poor, the sick, and the unfortunate of every description, let us not deprive them at once of those comforts, whether real or imaginary, which they derive from heaven. I think, however, that with all due regard to the spirit of religious fervour, it might be turned to a more beneficial purpose. Those sums which are spent in ex votos and offerings to the churches, the donors might be persuaded to apply to some charitable institution ; which, better to agree with their devotion, might be graced with the name of, and placed under the tutelar protection of, the Virgin Mary, or some favourite saint. A double benefit would thereby be derived ; a real one to the objects of the charity ; and an imaginary one, though, perhaps, not less effectual, to the donors. This beneficial turn of the tide of devotion might be effected by the influence of government, or even by the ministers of the church, if animated by a true Christian spirit ; and I merely suggest it here, to show how easy it would be, instead of"], [576, "238 EX VOTO OFFERINGS. proudly declaiming and unfeelingly sneering at the weakness and credulity of our fellow-creatures, to make them subservient to the general good. Many people can tear away and destroy, but few are able or inclined to mend or rebuild. The ex votos are either paintings, models, or sculptures. The first represent the miracles effected by the in tercession of the saint ; the others are, either hearts or other figures of silver or gold, sometimes of wax, allusive to some circumstance of the miracle ; and they are generally accompanied by a present of wax candles and money for the service of the church. The ex votos are a sacred property, and none but a violent hand ever dares to dispose of them. The sanctuary of our Lady of Loretto, in the Roman states, was extremely rich, from an im mense quantity of those precious offerings ; but at the time of the French invasion, the government of Rome foreseeing that they would fall into the hands of the republicans, thought better to be be forehand, and to employ the greater part of them to the service of the state, so that the French generals found themselves bitterly disappointed.

Italian literature is the oldest in modern Europe*. Five centuries have now elapsed since it was cre ated and brought almost suddenly from a state of infancy to full maturity, by the great Tuscan writers of the 14th century. Since that time it has gone through several phases, yet it can be safely asserted, that it has not ceased to be illus trated in every succeeding age by the productions of men of genius in almost every branch of letters, and this, notwithstanding the unparalleled mis fortunes of the country ; the scourge of wars, both civil and foreign ; the repeated invasions of stran gers ; the freezing influence of ignorance in power; the division of states and dialects ; the scantiness, if not the total want, of profit attached to literary labours ; the once prevalent use of the Latin tongue, and the encroachment of the French * The Spanish Language, which rivals the Italian in anti quity, has no work to be compared to Dante of the same date.

Notwithstanding all these disadvantages, and all the oppression, humi liation, and misery, resulting from them, Italy has been, during the last five centuries, abundant in writers, both in prose and verse, of grave and light styles \u2014 historians and dramatists, economists and satirists, tragic and epic poets. When we contemplate the unextinguishable flame of genius and learning which has thus per petuated itself in this country, by means of its beautiful language, and in spite of all obstacles, can we suppose for a moment, that such a language and such a literature should become extinct through momentary discouragement ; and this, too, at the present period, when a new impulse has just been given to them through the partial support, en couragement, and occasional freedom, afforded at some intervals of the political vicissitudes which have agitated the Italian Peninsula, and when the commerce of the mind among nations has increased tenfold ? And yet such an unaccountable fear has possessed several writers, foreign as well as native, who have allowed themselves to be infected with the prevailing mania of gloomy prophecies. These persons appear to see nothing beyond the actual time ; they seem disheartened by temporary em barrassments, instead of comparing the present with the past, from which comparison they might"], [581, ".ITALIAN LITERATURE. 243 draw many useful subjects of consolation, and even of congratulation. We will not, however, give ourselves up to those cheerless suggestions ; we will, like the ancient Roman, never despair of the fortunes of our country; but turn to the more satisfactory task of examining briefly the progress of Italian literature during the latter half of the last century, and following its steps to our pre sent days. The seventeenth century, which the Italians call the age of the seicentisti, is justly considered as having brought on a sort of corruption in Italian literature. Marini and his school are generally accused of having mostly contributed to this, by their affected and over-ornamented style, deficient in nature and solidity. But the bad taste, not only in the style, but also in the ideas, prevailing at that time, is of older date than that of Marini. Guarini himself, in his Pastor fido, had shown that effeminacy of thought, united, however, to the graces of composition, which became prevalent towards the close of the 16th century, \u2014 of that great age which had been illustrated by the writ ings of Ariosto, Tasso, Macchiavelli, Berni, and so many others. The seventeenth century, however, in the midst of its corrupt and flimsy taste, produced some writers of which Italy is proud, and with reason. R 2"], [582, "244 TREATISE ON MODERN Chiabrera, one of the best Italian lyrics ; Filicaja and Maggi, both patriotic writers, who seemed, especially the first, to be animated with some of the fire that Petrarch displays, when he speaks of the calamities of his beautiful country ; Tassoni, the author of the Secchia Rapita, or Rape of the Bucket; the historians Davila, Sarpi, Cardinal Bentivoglio; these and several others, such as Guidi, Redi, Menzini, illustrated the seventeenth century. The eighteenth century witnessed a general re- vival in almost every branch of Italian literature. Zeno, Metastasio, and Maffei, in the drama ; Vico and Gravina in rational philosophy; Frugoni in lyric poetry ; Giannone and Muratori, in the phi- losophy of history ; all these may be called the re- generators of Italian letters in the first half of the eighteenth century. These great men, however, were but the fore runners of a host of noble minds, which appeared in Italy towards the middle of the last century, lt was about that time that Italian literature began to assume a totally new character. The spirit of analysis, of sound logic, of real philosophy, in short, penetrated into the temple of Italian letters, which had been taken possession of by worshippers of false taste ; by sonnetteers, arcadians, and pe dants; and to whom minds original, independent,"], [583, "245 ITALIAN LITERATURE. and candid, had been considered almost as pro fane. An increase of prose writers, and a de preciation of the sonnet and canzone style, showed that the Italians began to think their language sit for something higher than mere amorous lays and opera songs. In comedy, Goldoni; in tragedy, Alfieri; in ro mantic poetry, Cesarotti ; Passeroni, and Parini, in the lyric, didactic, and satirical; Baretti and Gozzi, in criticism and philology ; Genovesi, in rational philosophy; Bettinelli, Denina, and Tira boschi, in historv; Carli and Verri in political economy ; Filangieri in legislation ; Beccaria in jurisprudence ; Martini and Turchi in religious studies. All these, and many others, gave a new aspect to the Italian literature of the last century. They all contributed to rouse Italian minds to their proper level, and, what is still more to their credit, all the writers I have mentioned, indeed almost all the Italian writers of the eighteenth century, whose names will pass to posterity, were moral. They did not bend their knees to the then fashionable infidelity ; they did not dishonour their pens, by endeavouring to corrupt the heart and destroy the best feelings of their countrymen, by means of those new doctrines which Rousseau, himself a competent judge, calls desolantes. If some of them entertained doubts upon religious"], [584, "246 TREATISE ON MODERN subjects, they at least kept them to themselves ; when they blamed religious abuses, it was always the outwork, the acknowledged structure of men, and not the essential parts of the religion of their country, that they attacked ; and if they wished to clear the temple of extraneous lumber, they always respected the sanctuary. And yet Alfieri, Genovesi, Parini, Bettinelli, and Verri, were not servile minds ; let it not be said that it was fear which prevented them, for who more fearless than Alfieri ? These very men were not always timid when speaking about politics ; several of them were living at the epoch of the revolution, when they could have written infidel or immoral works not only without molestation, but even with ap plause ; and yet they kept themselves pure from the corruption of their times. Among those Italian writers who meddled with politics, at the epoch of the revolution, and who favoured strongly the new ideas, one must ac knowledge, with few exceptions, their superior calmness and moderation, when compared to their ultramontane neighbours. And this in the midst of the most Baby Ionic confusion of ideas that ever took place among men ; when frenzy seemed to riot over the land, and novelties, such as would have startled the Gracchi of old, were applauded by men who had assumed the names, without"], [585, "247 ITALIAN LITERATURE. inheriting the minds, of the gigantic republicans of antiquity. The author, avowedly republican, of the Saggio Storico sulla Rivoluzione di Napoli nel 1799, a book full of sense, mixed with some declamation, justly observes, speaking of the well-informed class of his countrymen, that \" The Italian school of moral and political sciences followed principles totally different from those of the French revolu tionists. Men who had their minds filled with the ideas of Macchiavelli, Gravina, Vico, and Geno vesi, could not trust in the promises, nor applaud the operations of the French, since the latter had abandoned the principles of constitutional mon archy. In the same manner, the ancient philoso phical school of France, that of Montesquieu, for instance, would never have applauded the re volution. That school resembled the Italian, and both resembled much the Greek and the Latin.\" These few words afford a clue to the understand ing of the Italian character and sentiments. We will now proceed to examine some of the principal Italian writers of the last and present centuries, according to the respective branches of literature in which each of them has excelled. We will begin by the drama, on account of its close connexion with the national character, the importance of its influence upon a nation, and"], [586, "248 TREATISE ON MODERN the particular change it underwent in Italy during the last century. Previous to the eighteenth century, the drama, although very early cultivated in Italy, had not kept pace with the other branches of Italian lite rature. There were two sorts of dramas, le com mcdie antiche, or regular dramas, which were strictly fashioned upon the ancient Greek and Latin dramatists ; and the commedie dell' arte, or burlesque plays, of which the principal supports were masked personages, each of them intended to represent the peculiar characteristics of the inha bitants of some Italian province. These per sonages were called maschere ; the principal ones were Arlecchino, a foolish clown, from Bergamo ; Policinella, a Neapolitan servant, of whom I have spoken already; Pantalone, a good-natured Ve netian merchant ; Dottore, a quack, from Bologna ; Gelsomino, a Roman beau; Brighella, a rogue from Ferrara, and several others. These masks were in fact so many caricatures of the Italian provincial character. Each of them had a dress analogous to his part, and spoke the broad dia lect of his province. Others, like Tartaglia, a stammerer, Truffaldino, a cheat, had no peculiar country. Besides these masks, there were the amoroso, or lover, and his mistress, who supported the plot; and several inferior female characters in"], [587, "ITALIAN LITERATURE. 249 the persons of servette or waiting maids, with the generic names of Colombina, Smeraldina, &c. With these characters, each of whom had his particular part, the managers contrived to vary their performances, by merely sketching the out line of a new play, and each of the personages introduced contributed, mostly extempore, his part, indulging in jokes and double entendres. Several critics, among the rest Baretti, think that the commedie dell\" arte are the remains of the old Roman histrionics or farces. With all their faults, irregularities, and vul garities, these comedies were more natural, more original, and better adapted to the genius and vivacity of the Italians, and above all, more amusing than the old regular dramas; they, therefore, were great favourites with the public until the appear ance of Goldoni. Carlo Goldoni was born at Venice in the early part of the eighteenth century ; he was first brought up for the law, which profession, however, he abandoned for the (to him) superior attractions of the dramatic art. He attached himself to a com pany of comedians, and his plays began to appear towards the middle of the last century. He be took himself to reform the stage, by checking the laxitude and intemperance of the commedie dels arte, without, however, depriving them of their"], [588, "250 TREATISE ON MODERN great popular attraction, the masks, but confining these to written parts in each play, and making the plots more regular, dignified, and moral. This produced a complete alteration in the Italian stage. Goldoni had to encounter the aversion of the actors for the additional trouble of learning their parts by heart, and of confining their imagi nation within rules ; he had also against him the partiality of many of the spectators for licentious wit and low buffoonery, as well as the envy of the rival companies, who continued to uphold the commedie dell' arte. He describes his difficulties in a very amusing manner in his Teatro Comico, in which he represents the rehearsal of one of his own plays, and answers the objections of the par tisans of the other style. He there states also that he wrote sixteen new plays, of which he gives the names, in one year. This extraordinary fa cility of composition rendered Goldoni, at times, careless about his style. He had studied well the peculiarities and manners of his own countrymen, especially of the lower classes of Venetians, but he showed himself extremely ignorant of those of foreign nations. His plays are, in their plan, half regular, half romantic ; half serious, half burlesque in their sen timents ; abounding with improbabilities, and often deficient in common information. Although in-"], [589, "251 ITALIAN LITERATURE. tentionally moral, his morality is often flimsy and too worldly. Yet with all these, and other faults, Goldoni has certainly the merit of having given a comic theatre to Italy, upon which those who have come after have improved, and will still improve, for which there is yet abundance of room. Goldoni has written more than a hundred plays, some in Italian, in which, however, he frequently introduces characters speaking their dialect ; and some in the Venetian dialect; the latter are the most amusing by their humour ; in his own city, on its canals, lagune, and gondolas, Goldoni was perfectly at home. Goldoni, like all those who strike out a new path in the literature of their country, has been too severely criticised by some, and too lavishly praised by others. Among the former were his rival, Carlo Gozzi, and the critic Baretti. Among his exaggerated encomiasts is to be reckoned Vol taire, whose letters to Goldoni contain many ful some compliments, which only serve to show that that great French dramatist was not much better acquainted with the spirit of Italian literature than he has shown himself to be on other occasions with that of the English. Goldoni often excels in ridiculing affectation, absurdity, unfounded pretensions, and fashionable"], [590, "252 TREATISE ON MODERN vice. But there is also a strong tinge of vulgarity in his characters, which shows him to have been less acquainted with the higher than with the lower ranks of life. He has, however, traced out several truly honest and noble characters, who preserve their integrity in the midst of very strong temptations, and these he evidently drew from his own heart, which was decidedly good and in genuous. Such are, among the rest, his Vero Amico, FAvvocato Veneziano, and others. Contemporary with Goldoni was Carlo Gozzi, also a Venetian, and younger brother to Gaspare, the philologist. This man, whose life was a con tinual succession of strange vicissitudes, of domestic broils, and literary squabbles, had from nature an eccentric turn of mind, which he fully indulged. Endowed with a fertile but intemperate imagina tion, excessively satirical, and a keen observer of other men's foibles, his chief delights seemed to be to turn them into ridicule. By his own memoirs, to which he gave the singular title of Memorie inulili della Vita di Carlo Gozzi, scritte da lui medesimo, e pubblicate per umilta, he confesses that human nature never appeared to him under a more ludicrous light than when it aspires to a loftiness of sentiments. \" This vulgar manner of judging men,\" observes Ugoni, in his Letteratura"], [591, "253 ITALIAN LITERATURE. Italiana*, art. Carlo Gozzi, \" must be attributed to the low company in which he spent all his life.\" In fact, Gozzi, who disliked Goldoni's innova tions in the dramatic art, associated himself with a company of comedians, known by the name of truppa Sacchi, who performed the old plays or commedie dell' arte, and who were nearly ruined by the new attractions of Goldoni's plays. Gozzi became their poet, their patron, and their prin cipal support. He made them a present of his plays, and he took pains to instruct the per formers. He lived, in short, among them, and this during five and twenty years, until the disso lution of the company. Gozzi's plays are a mixture of allegory, parody, and of the marvellous ; and in this some analogy has been found between them and those of Aristo phanes. He engrafted sorcery and fairyism upon the old Italian farce. The first play which he exhibited to the public is styled FAmore delle tre Melarance, \" the love of the three China oranges.\" The idea of this play originated, as Baretti relates, in a dispute Gozzi had with Goldoni in a bookseller's shop at. * To this excellent work, which I have already mentioned, I am indebted for the best part of the information concerning Gozzi."], [592, "254 TREATISE ON MODERN Venice, about the merit of the plays of the latter. Goldoni told Gozzi that it was much easier to find fauht with a play than to write one. Gozzi re plied that he thought so differently on the subject, that he would make all Venice crowd to see the Tale of the three Oranges performed. This was an old nursery-tale, well known at Venice. And so he actually did. In this composition Gozzi ridiculed the plays of Goldoni and those of his contemporary Chiari, a dull sentimental dramatist as well as prose writer, whose numerous works have long since been laid on the shelf, which, how ever, is not the case with those of Goldoni. Gozzi succeeded in restoring the compagnia Sacchi to popularity ; he wrote for them many fairy plays, among the rest, II Re Cervo, La Zo beide, Turandotte, and others of fantastic names, and some imitated from the Spanish of Calderon, Morito, and others. The commedie dell' ar te, and those of Gozzi, have been since exploded from the Italian stage, and Goldoni's school has obtained the preponderance. Avelloni, Gualzetti, Federici, and Greppi, are also dramatists of the last century, but they are chiefly imitators of the French and German thea tres. Some of their plays, however, are in esti mation, especially the tre Terese of Greppi."], [593, "255 ITALIAN LITERATURE. The taste for foreign imitation, which became so prevalent in Italy towards the latter part of the eighteenth century, extended tq the stage, and checked the improvement of the Italian drama. The morbid affectation of sentimentality, preva lent in many plays performed on the Italian stage, became truly nauseous. De Rossi and Giraud, both natives of Rome, and Alberto Nota, of Genoa, have contributed, however, to revive, in Italy, the taste for national elegant comedy. The first has sketched his cha racters from real life and genteel society, wittily describing its errors and vices. Sismondi observes, that \" His satire, unfortunately, has too much severity in it to pass for mere humour, and his characters are either too mean or too vicious to deserve our sympathy;\" but he says, also, \" that his productions discover greater power of imagina tion, wit, and truth, than those of any other comic writer of Italy.\" One of De Rossi's comedies is II Cortigiano Onesto, \" The honest Courtier.\" Guglielmo is the secretary of the governor of a provincial town, who is in love with an intriguing woman, Donna Aurelia, and who, on her account, commits several acts of arbitrary power. The secretary, an up right man, opposes, as much as it is in his power,"], [594, "256 TREATISE ON MODERN the influence of Aurelia. The latter, who sees that the honesty of the secretary is an impediment to her ambitious and interested views, persuades the governor to obtain for him a situation at court, in order to remove him from the sphere of her in fluence. Guglielmo independently refuses the proffered promotion, saying, he will retire on a small independence he has. Meantime the mar shal commanding the province arrives with full powers from his sovereign, and he finds the governor, in company with his mistress, sur rounded by a crowd of hungry intriguers. He soon discovers the whole plot, which was to abuse the easy good-nature of the governor, and he also finds out, that the only honest man among the whole is the late secretary. The governor, se verely reprimanded by the marshal, perceives, at last, that his mistress is a real jilt, and that in the moment of his disgrace she abandons him, when she finds she has nothing more to hope from him. The governor is abandoned by all, the secretary alone is faithful to him to the last. The mar shal, sifting to the bottom the characters of all the persons interested in the affair, punishes several, admonishes the governor, while he sends Donna Aurelia into a monastery, and thus the scene closes by one of those acts of power with"], [595, "ITALIAN LITERATURE. 257 which people in Italy have been long familiar, and which they, however, applaud, when employed by a just impartial hand. Giraud, also a native of Rome, and one of the latest of the Italian comic writers, has followed with success the line of real comedy. His Ajo nell' Imbarazzo, and his Priore di Cerreto, are among his best and most interesting plays. We now come to another writer of our times, who enjoys a well-merited reputation on the Italian stage, Alberto Nota, an advocate of Genoa. His plays are well written, truly moral, but rather tame and not abundant in the vis comica. Some of them, however, such as II Pro gettista, (l'homme a projets,) II Filosofo celibe, and La Donna Ambiziosa rise above the rest by the interest of the situations, the display of con trasts, and the dignity of language. / primi Passi al mal Costume, affords a lively picture of the fashionable manners in Italy, exemplified in a young bride, married only a few months, who already gives way to the follies of dissipation, coquetry, extravagance, and servenlismo.

The veteran, satisfied with this, be comes her warm defender. The lady's intrigue, however, with a young lieutenant, which was at first a mere matter of common-place gallantry, assumes a more serious and dangerous aspect ; presents and billet-doux are received, and all this under that most fatal, deceitful veil of platonic love, which has been, and still continues to be, the ruin of so many inexperienced young women. The character of the lieutenant is that of an artful despicable rake ; a character, unfortunately, not. mon. The husband, by means of an un married sister, an envious hypocritical woman, whom the bride has taken no pains to conciliate, obtains evident proofs of his wife's imprudence, if not yet actual guilt.

Camilla (the bride) had planned to go to a masked ball in the evening, and there meet her gallant. She had prepared a splendid dress for the occasion. Her husband forbids her at first to go, and this in presence of the lieutenant, under pretence that she is not sufficiently well ; then, after some reflection, seeing her extremely mor tified at the idea of being kept a prisoner at home, he tells her, when they are left by themselves, that she may go, if she consents not to put on her new dress (by which she would be known) and to accom pany him under a common mask. They proceed to the rooms, and there Camilla, to her great vexation, sees the lieutenant, whom she thought mourning at his lodgings over her disappointment and his, gaily sauntering with another lady whom he also courted. She hears, with her own ears, that he lauo-hs at her folly, and disclaims any real affection for her, while he boastswith several of his acquaint ances that she is over head and ears in love with him, and shows even her likeness, which he had by surprise taken from her that very morning, and which, he says, completes a half-dozen portraits he has from different ladies. The veil is rent from S 2"], [598, "260 TREATISE ON MODERN the eyes of the unfortunate Camilla ; next day she confesses her weakness before her father, her husband, and the lieutenant himself, whom she up braids for his baseness. Her husband, seeing her sincere penitence, forgives her ; the lieutenant sets off for the army, the intriguing chambermaid is dismissed, and the married couple begin a new career of domestic tranquillity. With the single exception of Maffei, the author of the Merope, Italy had no tragedians deserving the name, before Alfieri. Ma ben si vendico I\" Italo nume Ch' uno ne forse qual non vider mai Le due tanto diverse altere Rome. So says Countess Saluzzo, of Turin, herself a worshipper of Melpomene. Alfieri's tragedies have been criticised by men of letters of every country in Europe. He has given, however, the Italians a tragic theatre, and has opened thereby a new career to their genius. With no great fertility of imagination, his soul was rich in great and lofty sentiments: he was intimately acquainted with the stormy passions, and his powers of keen obser vation were employed to dive into and describe the secrets of men's hearts. The extreme sim plicity of his plays, circumscribed as they are by the most strict deference to the unities of time,"], [599, "261 ITALIAN LITERATURE. place, and action ; the absence of love, episodes, and subordinate plot; the paucity of charac ters; all these disadvantages are redeemed by the beauty of his diction \u2014 by the intense interest his chief personages and their dark passions inspire \u2014 by the terrific suspense in which he keeps us to the very brink of the catastrophe \u2014 by the eloquent, and often sublime, descrip tions he gives of man's inward struggles, and of the secret workings of his wayward heart. There is a magic, the magic of power, the flash of truth, often horrible truth, over Alfieri's tra gedies. The action of the plot, undiverted by any other, carries us along with an irresistible vehemence. In the delineations of the heart, he resembles a great English poet, whose untimely death is now universally lamented. Both have excelled in depicting the dark side of human na ture, the fallen angel in the shape of man, wicked but still great, tormented and tormenting others. Both can be pathetic at times, and most exqui sitely so.

In the dialogue between Saul and the High Priest, Achimelech, we have a beautiful display of that unmoved fortitude, founded upon the satisfac tion of conscience, which faith alone can give, and against which all the rage of men storms in vain, as the wave against the rock. There is a haughty regal dignity in Saul, but it quails before that of the humble minister of God. Saul: Ma, chi se' tu? Conoscerti ben parmi. Del fantastico altero gregge sei De' veggenti di Rama ?

The whole of this dialogue presents a most ani mated description of those disputes which have so often occurred between the altar and the throne, between the secular and the ecclesiastical powers.

The affection of Saul for his children accom- panies him in the midst of all his wrath and fury, and of the crimes which his ungovernable passions lead him into. It is the quality for which we still feel an interest for the wretched old man to the moment of his death. Although he at times as- sumes a tone of asperity, and even of seeming aversion, towards his children, he is extremely jealous lest any one else should slight or offend them. The officious Abner, who had dared to forget for a moment the respect due to the race of his sovereign, he thus reminds of their relative stations : Sdegno sta su la faecia de' miei figli? Chi, chi gli oltraggia ? Abner tu forse ? Questi Son sangue mio; noi sai? ... Taci: rimembra. A. II. Sc. 2. When, in his frightful alienation of mind, he foresees his approaching death, although careless about his fate, he condescends to pray and to humble himself before the fancied ghost of Samuel to intercede for his children, who, he says affect ingly, \" are innocent of his guilt.\" And at the moment of death, when he is ap prized that his sons have fallen in battle, his last"], [605, "267 ITALIAN LITERATURE. care, his last commands to Abner are for the safety of his daughter Micol.

How affecting this last caution, and how painful to his pride as a king to utter it ; but yet paternal love conquers all. I have expatiated thus upon the pathetic parts of one of Alfieri's tragedies, in answer to those who complain of his excessive sternness and de ficiency in the softer feelings. Were I to dwell upon his descriptive powers, the elevation of his thoughts, the comprehensiveness of his diction, or to animadvert upon the faults of his com positions considered as dramatic performances, I should by far exceed the limits I have proposed to myself in this Essay. A want of harmony in his style, and a harshness in his versification, have been reproached to Alfieri. His reason for adopting his sometimes singular construction of phrases and arrangement of words, was to give Italian tragedy a distinctive character, different from epic or lyric poetry, and to pre serve its dignity. This he thought the more"], [606, "268 TREATISE ON MODERN essential in a language such as the Italian, full of vowels and of natural softness of sounds. Dante, of whom Alfieri professed himself a disciple, had given him in several parts of his poem a model of that nervous, laconic, and sometimes harsh diction which Alfieri adopted, thinking it adapted to express violent passions. Alfieri was not only a dramatist, he was also a prose writer. The style of his prose partakes of the qualities we have just been examining as cha racteristic of his tragedies. It is full of his poli tical ideas, which were peculiarly his own. An aristocrat by birth and by temper, but impressed with strong notions of the rights and of the dignity of mankind, he was an enemy of absolute mo narchy; and as in his time all monarchies, except England, were absolute, he imbibed an indis criminate aversion for monarchs and monarchical forms. When the French revolution broke out, however, Alfieri, who was then at Paris, soon per ceived the exaggeration of the parties, and the evil tendency of the doctrines which were pompously broached out. as tending to regenerate the world. He gives a sketch of the events which passed be fore his eyes, and from which he argued the fall of that still-born republic. Alfieri left Paris in August, 1792, and returned to seek for security and liberty in Italy, as he confesses with astonish-"], [607, "269 ITALIAN LITERATURE. ment, leaving behind, his books, manuscripts, and other property, which were all seized, as he in forms us. After his return to his native country, he fixed his residence at Florence; and there, dis gusted with men and things, he became misanthro pical and solitary; he abstained from reading papers and new publications, discontinued all cor respondence or intercourse, except with two or three intimate friends, among whom were the Duchess of Albany, and his countryman, 1' Abate Caluso di Valperga. His gloomy mood led him to acts of unnecessary austerity and even uncourteousness. He died at Florence in October, 1803, in the fifty-fourth year of his age, and was buried in the church of Santa Croce. The following sonnet, describing the person and character of Alfieri, is reported to have been written by himself: \u2014 Sublime specchio di veraci detti Mostrami in corpo e in anima qua? sono: Rari in fronte ho i capelli e rossi pretti ; Alta statura e capo a terra prono. Sotti? persona su due stinchi schietti, Biauca pelle, occhio azzurro, aspetto buono, Giusto naso, bel labbro, e denti eletti ; Pallido in volto come Re sul trono. Or crudo acerbo, ora pieghevo? mite, Irato spesso, non maligno mai, La mente, il cor', sempre in perpetua lite. Son' talor lieto e talor mesto assai, Or stimandomi Achille ora Tersite: Uomo son grande o vil? muori e '1 saprai."], [608, "270 TREATISE ON MODERN His disappointment and disgust at the fatal turn taken by the French revolution, is strongly ex pressed in a sonnet written at Paris in July, 1790 : \u2014 Preso ha il timon chi fii pur dianzi al remo ; E toga e mitra e spada e scettro e penna, Tutto in un fascio appiccasi al? antenna, Scherno alia ciurma onde ogni capo e scemo.

Poco intanto e il biscotto, i mari immensi, Tutto e sentina in quella viva tomba; E cosi ai lidi di Fortuna viensl. His indignation rose to a still higher pitch in con sequence of the events of the two following years, and vented itself in this violent strain: \u2014 Di liberti maestri i Galli?

Schiavi or siain, si ; ma schiavi almen frementi ; Non quali, o Galli, e il foste e il siete vui; Schiavi, al poter qual ch' ei pur sia, plaudenti."], [609, "ITALIAN LITERATURE. 271 Count Alfieri had been a professed republican in his principles, and had consequently shunned the court of his natural sovereign, the late King of Sardinia, while in the meridian of his power; but when the same king, Charles Emmanuel, be ing driven out of his kingdom by the French, sought a temporary refuge in Tuscany, Alfieri, who had also retired to Florence, went unex pectedly to pay his respects to the fugitive mo narch: the king received him with a smile of be nignity, and addressing him in a tone of mild reproach \u2014 \" Ebbene, Signor Conte,\" said he, \" ec comi qui uno di quei Re come li vorreste veder tutti.\" Alfieri, after the revolution of France and the invasion of Italy, felt that bitter pang of disap pointment, which proceeds from a sense of having long worshipped an unworthy idol, because he had mistaken the sort of liberty which ought to have been the object of his adoration. He reminds us of Brutus's exclamation before his suicide: \" O virtue, thou art but a name.\" One formed himself as false an idea of virtue as the other did of liberty. Hence their grief and their disappointment. Monti's tragedies of Aristodemo and CajoGracco are well known; they are on the classic plan, and have great beauties, especially the first. His"], [610, "272 TREATISE ON MODERN Galeotto Manfredi is not perhaps equal to either, although it contains some beautiful passages. But Monti, after writing the above three plays, left altogether the service of Melpomene. Of all his works, the Basvilliana, one of his earliest, and unfinished as it is, is the one which will preserve the longest his poetical reputation. He, like Alfieri, is a great partisan of Dante, and his Basvilliana is as close and as happy an imitation of the Divina Commedia as the difference of the subject and the originality of Monti's plan could allow. Several Italian writers have distinguished them selves of late years as followers of the tragic muse, and have excited hopes that this noblest walk of the drama, which the great poet of Asti first opened to Italian genius, will still be followed by his countrymen with successful steps. Silvio Pellico, a Piedmontese, has written two tragedies, both on Italian subiects of the middle ages, Francesca da Rimini and Eufemio da Mes sina. The story of the former is well known as described by Dante in those beautiful lines of the Inferno, Canto v. Noi leggevamo un giorno per diletto Di Lancilotto come Amor lo strinse : Soli eravaino e senza alcun sospetto. Per piu fiati gli occhi ci sospinse Quella lettura e scolorocci il viso ; Ma solo un punto fu quel ehe ci vinse."], [611, "ITALIAN LITERATURE. 273 Pellico, however, has endeavoured, by altering some circumstances of the original story as told by Dante, to throw a greater interest on the character of the two lovers, by making them appear the innocent victims of untoward fate, and of Lan ciotto's jealousy, to which, however, their mutual sentiments gave rise. The unexpected return of Paolo, Lanciotto's brother, from the eastern wars, discovers to Francesca the long secret passion which he had conceived for her since he had seen her at Ravenna, while on a mission to her father's court, and before she was betrothed to Lanciotto. The unfortunate Francesca, from that fatal day, had also felt a corresponding flame which she strove to conquer, but in vain. Paolo soon after left her for the east, without having discovered his passion. The will of her father Guido made her marry Lanciotto, Lord of Rimini, and Paolo's brother. She was resigned and dutiful ; and fancied almost that she had forgotten him whom it was now sinful for her to love, when Paolo appeared ao-ain at Rimini, and found, what he had not heard of before, his first and only love, whose memory he had always kept in his heart, now become his brother's wife.

The contrast between the frater nal affection and the conjugal jealousy of Lanci otto ; the haughty sentiment of conscious innocence of Paolo, who finds himself all at once, and with out knowing it, his brother's rival ; the frankness with which he confesses his love, but at the same time asserts his innocence and Francesca's purity ; the rage of Lanciotto, who threatens his brother not only with his death but also with the death of Francesca, \u2014 all these form a most impressive, heart rending scene. Lanciotto tells his brother that if he were to sacrifice them both to his jealousy, Fame would say they had deserved their fate. Paolo's reply is in a simple, and therefore most affecting strain.

She had laboured to obliterate his image, she says, and her secret should have died with her, had it not been for the unexpected return of Paolo. Old Guido, Francesca's father, prevails upon Lanciotto to let his daughter return with him to Ravenna, there to spend the rest of her days in retirement. Francesca is on the point of leaving Lanciotto's palace, and is invoking peace and blessings upon the two brothers, when Paolo, who was confined by his brother's order in another part of the castle, having seduced his guards, rushes in furiously, and without having any distinct object in view, but merely because he fancies that Fran cesca is not safe while in Rimini, unless under his protection. She endeavours to calm him, but meantime Lanciotto enters, to whom she had just sent her father to ask a parting interview; the two brothers fight ; Francesca, attempting to part them, is struck by Lanciotto, and Paolo, seeing her wounded, throws down his sword, and re ceives his brother's weapon through the body. The diction of the Francesca da Rimini is flow ing, elegant, and easy ; it has not the roughness of Alfieri's verse. The Francesca was performed with great applause in the principal Italian cities.

The story is taken from the old chronicles of the con quest of Sicily, made by the Saracens early in the ninth century. Eufemio, a valiant Sicilian warrior, but of a plebeian origin, had rendered the greatest services to his country, by defending it against the Moors, and by assisting his countrymen to break the yoke of the Greek emperor. He had also been the means of making one Theodore, a powerful chief, the acknowledged ruler of the whole island. Eufemio thought, after this, that he might aspire to.the hand of Theodore's daughter, Ludovica. But her proud father, offended at his presumption, and destining her to be the wife of the Prince of Salerno, arrested him, and threw him into a dun geon. Eufemio escaped, and, disgusted with the ingratitude of his countrymen, none of whom had lifted a hand or spoken a word in his favour, swore against them eternal hatred. He crossed over to Africa, and invited the Saracens to invade Sicily : M' involo Dal career mio : prodigio e : sovra lieve Pino alie tempeste onde m' aflido: D' Africa ai liti orridi giungo . . . e umani Cor, nella patria de' leon ritrovo, Tetto ospital, fe', riverenza.

Theodore fights, but is taken prisoner in a sally, and brought before Eufemio. A long scene of mutual upbraiding takes place ; at last Eufemio learns from Theodore, that Ludovica has retired into a convent, and pro nounced her vows the day before. Eufemio sends his faithful Saracen friend, Almanzor, into the town to demand the maid, under pain of levelling Messina to the ground; but the old venerable bishop opposes it, and persuades his countrymen to stand firm. Eufemio is uncertain what to do; the confession of his perplexity, which brings on the recollection of his former years, is beautifully natural, and the feelings he expresses are such as must often have tortured the heart of many a renegado.

Eufemio receives her in his arms, but Theodore curses her. In a private interview, however, that Ludovica has with her father, she reveals to him her secret views. She is the victim of enthusiasm ; she thinks herself another Judith, destined to save her native town. The manner in which the abbess and the bishop wound up her exalted fancy, is skilfully described. But at the sight of her former lover, her courage fails. Eufemio offers to marry her immediately, and while she is half persuaded to give her hand to him, the Christians sally out of the town, a battle ensues, the Saracens have the advantage, and Mes sina is in flames. In the fifth act, Ludovica ap pears wandering over the field of battle ; she meets her dying father, who makes her promise again to destroy Eufemio, in order, he says, to save Italy, perhaps all Europe, from the yoke of the Koran. Soon after, meeting Eufemio, who is also roaming over the field of battle, in despair"], [617, "279 ITALIAN LITERATURE. for having missed her, she stabs, him, and he dies forgiving her, and acknowledging his errors. This play, though full of action, is perhaps less natural, less regular, as well as less truly dramatic, than Francesca da Rimini. But the subject is of a more general interest ; the passions are powerfully described; and the language is worthy of the loftiness of the subject, where religious fanaticism and worldly ambition lead the principal characters. The subordinate character of Almanzor is the most interesting. Unambitious, but devoted to his religion, a true friend to Eufemio, but still more faithful to the Koran ; he is one of those characters we may fancy to have existed among the early Saracens, a mixture of fanaticism and strong sense, of national ambition and personal disinterestedness, of fierceness and humanity. The author of the above two tragedies, endowed with extreme susceptibility, has had the misfortune of being compromised in the late political disturb ances in the north of Italy. He was intimate in the house of a Milanese nobleman, whose name is among those tried by the Austrian government for conspiracy ; and Pellico's opinions being con sidered as leaning to the same side, he was arrested and put in prison at Venice, where he has remained for some years. This is another melancholy con-"], [618, "280 TREATISE ON MODERN sequence of the present disturbed state of the public mind in Italy, of which so many valuable men are now the victims. Silvio Pellico wrote also in a literary journal which appeared at Milan after the restoration, called // Conciliatore, which was remarkably well conducted, but was after a time discontinued. Alessandro Manzoni, known for several philo logical and critical writings, is one of the au thors of our davs who have added to the lustre of the Italian Melpomene. In his Conte di Car magnola, published in 1820, he has neglected the unities of time and of place, and so endeavoured to shake off the too strict yoke of the classics. He gives his reasons for so doing in a well-written preface at the head of his play. \" Among the various expedients,\" he says, \" by which men have contrived to embroil themselves and their actions, one of the most ingenious is, that of having upon almost every article of their conduct two opposite maxims, both of which are considered as infallible : applying this universal rule to the petty concerns of poetry, they tell those who court the Muses : You must be original, but must not strike off into any path in which the great poets have not pre ceded you.\" He then shows the futility of the reasons adduced by the classic rigorists founded"], [619, "281 ITALIAN LITERATURE. upon an obscure passage of Aristotle, and a servile veneration towards the Greek drama tists. The history of the Count ofCarmagnola dates at the beginning of the fifteenth century. He was a Piedmontese peasant who enlisted early in life in a troop of condottieri, and who, having risen in military rank, rendered the most useful services to Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan, for whom he conquered Milan and all Lombardy. Filippo, weak and suspicious, showed himself ungrateful to the valiant chief to whom he owed his crown. Carmagnola was obliged to escape, and he went to offer his service to the Venetian senate, the enemy of Filippo Maria. The sitting of the senate in which the offers of service of Carmagnola are discussed, displays the artful dark policy of those haughty patricians. Carmagnola's services, how ever, are accepted, and he is sent with an army against the duke's troops, which he defeats. At the end of the second act, where the dispositions of the battle are made, the poet has tried the ex periment, as he calls it himself, of introducing a beautiful chorus, which serves to describe under the veil of lyric effusion what is taking place in the field of battle.

The language and the sentiments are equally beautiful. The poet first addresses Italy : \u2014 Tu ehe angusta a tuoi figli parevi ; Tu ehe in pace nutrirli non sai, Fatal terra ! gli estrani ricevi : Tal Giudicio comincia per te.

Carmagnola, notwithstanding his gallantry and his frank open character, falls under the suspicions of the Council of Ten ; he is accused of treachery, is craftily insnared into Venice, undergoes a mock trial, and is beheaded. The character of that gallant soldier, but haughty and imprudent man, is well preserved to the last. The parting scene with his wife is truly affecting. In short, II Conte di Carmagnola is one of the best tragedies Italy has produced since Alfieri's. In epic heroic poetry, since the arjpearance of Orlando and Gerusalemme, Italy seems to be rest ing upon her laurels. Cesarotti is perhaps, as For syth justly observes, of all the Italian poets of the last century the one who has shown powers equal to an original epic ; he, however, with the idea of shaking the classic yoke and of opening a new"], [623, "285 ITALIAN LITERATURE. school, instead of choosing his own subject, em ployed his genius to give the Italians a free trans lation of Ossian's poems. His object was to show that Homer was not the only, nor the most perfect, model of epic composition. In so doing, however, Cesarotti fell into the opposite extreme from that which he wished to expose, the too great vene ration for the ancient models ; he sinned by too great license, and also he did not render sufficient justice to the Greek bard. Ugoni remarks that an innovator who rises in the midst of a city*, stationary in the study of letters, is like the pro digal son of a miser. In both cases, the example of one vice, and the aversion to it, lead to the opposite extreme. Cesarotti's translation of Ossian's Poems is the best amongst his productions. He has given a new energy to the Italian language, and has enriched it with new words, particularly with compound adjectives, after the manner of the English and Germans, for which he has been blamed by some critics, but approved by others. He conceived that languages ought not to remain stationary, but should follow the progress of ideas, and that new words should be invented to supply new wants. Cesarotti's Ossian was much admired, and became familiar with the Italians; some of its * Cesarotti was born and educated at Padua, a city cele brated for classic learning."], [624, "286 TREATISE ON MODERN passages are truly sublime.

One of the most interesting romantic poems which Italy has produced of late years is the Ildegonda, by Tommaso Grossi. It is a poetical romance in ottava rima, and the tale is, according to the prevalent, and not altogether injudicious, taste of the romantic school, taken from the history of Italy in the middle ages, at the time of the Lombard league against the emperor Frederic II."], [631, "293 ITALIAN LITERATURE. The tale is briefly as follows. Rizzardo, a valiant young Milanese knight, loved, and was beloved by, Ildegonda, a maid of a conspicuous family of that city. Ildegonda's lather had pro mised her hand, without her knowledge, to a Roman count, with whom he had become intimate during a mission he had carried on at Rome. When he, however, on his return, communicated his intentions to his daughter, she peremptorily refused, and he proposed to her the then cus tomary alternative of taking the veil. Ildegonda retires to the convent ; meanwhile Rizzardo is chosen by his countrymen to lead the armed men which they were going to send to the crusade wars, according to the terms of the treaty made with Frederic and the pope. Before his depar ture, Rizzardo makes an attempt to persuade Ildegonda to accompany him to the Holy Land, disguised as a knight. One night that Ildegonda sat by the grated window of her cell, she saw a sable knight stalking at the foot of the walls of the monastery. But here I shall quote the beau tiful passage as it is in the original.

She then fancies she sees the ghost of Rizzardo, who, in fulfilment of a promise he had formerly made, that if he died before her he would re turn from the world of spirits to apprize her of his fate. The fright and anguish of poor Ildegonda de ranges her mental faculties, she throws herself from a terrace, and is mortally wounded ; she, however, recovers her mind, begs the forgiveness of all, and prepares herself resignedly for another life. Her last moments remind us of Tasso's beau tiful decription of Clorinda's death.

Lyric and didactic poetry have been cultivated with success in Italy during the last fifty years. The principal writers who have followed these branches of literature are Passeroni, Parini, Fan- toni, Pindemonte, Mazza, Bondi, Foscolo, and several others. One of the most beautiful speci- mens of Italian lyric poetry is a little poem by Foscolo, which he styled / Sepolcri. The subject was a law passed during the republi- can sway in the north of Italy, forbidding in- scriptions over the tombs of the dead, or any sign of distinction or commemoration. The author addresses his poem to his illustrious cotemporary Ippolito Pindemonte, who happened to be at the same time engaged upon the same topic, but abandoned it, when he found that Foscolo had already written on the subject. The poet begins by asking himself whether tombs and cypresses, and all the funeral ornaments render the sleep of death less heavy ? But is it, he answers, for the dead alone, or rather is it not for the living that the custom of honouring the dead has been instituted ? Those who leave no affectionate remembrance of them alone are careless about their tombs. Sol chi non lascia eredita' d' affetti Poca gioja ha del? urna ; e se pur inira"], [639, "301 ITALIAN LITERATURE. Dopo ? esequie, errar vede il suo spirto Fra '1 compianto de' templi Acherontei, O ricovrarsi sotto le grandi ale Del perdono d' Iddio : ma la sua polve Lascia alie ortiche di diserta gleba Ove ne donna innamorata preghi, Ne passeggicr solingo oda il sospiro Che dal tumulo a noi manda Natura. He then takes an opportunity of complaining that no monument had been erected to the memory of the great Milanese poet Parini. Describing afterwards the advantages of having rural ceme teries, which honour the dead, without endanger ing the health of the living, as by the old Italian custom of burying in the churches, he proceeds to show the moral effects of the sight of the tombs of illustrious men, and he relates the impressions he felt in visiting the celebrated church of Santa Croce, and beholding there the tombs of Macchia velli, Michelangelo, and Galileo. He thence takes occasion to praise Florence for having col lected in one temple the memorials of Italian genius. To Santa Croce, Vittorio Alfieri used to pay frequent visits in his latter years. Foscolo describes him admirably : \u2014 E a questi marmi Venne spesso Vittorio ad ispirarsi, Irato a' patrii Numi, errava muto Ove Arno e piii deserto, i campi e il cielo Desioso mirando ; e poi die nullo Vivente aspetto gli molcea la cura,"], [640, "302 TREATISEON MODERN Qui posava ? austero, e avea sul volto II pallor della inorte e la speranza. Con questi grandi abita eterno : e 1' ossa Fremono amor di patria. Ah si ! da questa Religiosa pace un Nume parla : E nutria contro a' Persi in Maratona Ove Atene sacro tombe a' suoi prodi La virtu greca e ? ira. He then mentions the recent discovery made in the plains of the Troas by some travellers, of the sepulchre of Ilus, one of the Dardanides ; and this leads the poet into a short digression on the fate of Troy, and on its bard the immortal Homer. / Sepolcri has been greatly praised by the best judges. Pindemonte wrote a small poem in answer, in which he supports Foscolo's arguments. Replying to the unfeeling objection of those who ask of what use is a monument to the dead, Pindemonte observes : \u2014 Ah non e solo Per gli estinti la tomba ! Innamorata Donna ehe a brun vestita il volto iuchina Sovra la pietra ehe il suo sposo serra, Vedelo ancora, gli favella, ? ode, Trova eio ch' e il maggior ne' piii crudeli Mali ristoro : un lagrimar dirotto. He then complains, that in the cemetery of Verona, Pindemonte's native town, every distinc- tion was excluded between the different tombs, no inscription allowed, and the entrance forbid den to the living. He afterwards describes the"], [641, "ITALIAN LITERATURE. 303 singular vaults they have in Sicily, where the bodies of the dead are preserved by some parti cular process, dressed up in the same clothes they used to wear in life, and stationed in niches around, where they remain for many years, visited by the relatives, who can almost fancy them as still among the living. Blank verse seems of late to have been adopted by the best Italian writers instead of prose, for all serious and grave subjects. Indeed, Italian blank verse, if managed by a skilful hand, seems pe culiarly adapted for discussing similar matters. Easy, yet dignified ; lofty, yet unaffected ; free, yet chaste ; this metre seems most congenial to this beautiful language. Moral and didactic com positions, tragedies, satirical works, rural descrip tions, sentimental and elegiac strains, and often even lyric effusions, are written in this metre. Some complain that this is abuse, that it tends to make rhymed poetry, which is so beautiful in Italian, neglected ; but rhymed poetry is best adapted for the epopea, the tale or fable, and the epigrammatic style. Clemente Bondi deserves a rank among the good Italian writers of the last and present centuries. He was tutor to the sons of the Archduke Fer dinand, once governor of Austrian Lombardy. After the French invasion, he retired to Germany,"], [642, "304 TREATISE ON MODERN and made Vienna his residence. In his little poem, Le Conversazioni, which is perhaps the best of his works, he paints, with good-natured satire, the fashionable absurdities and foibles of his coun trymen. The following is his description of the egotist : Quello ravvisi Ch' entra se sol mirando ? II gran pensiero L'occupa di se stesso, e tanta ei prende Cura di se ehe ne dispensa il mondo. Suo nome e ?

To this bold likeness, the author adds his testi mony, that among the multitude of infidel writers, so much in vogue in his time, he had not read a single argument which could excite one doubt in his mind on the truth of revealed religion. One of the great modern Italian poets on lyric and didactic subjects is the already-mentioned Ca valiere Pindemonte, of Verona. This illustrious writer, and most amiable and accomplished man, has been beautifully portrayed by his cotemporary and half countrywoman, Countess Albrizzi, in her Ritratti, or moral portraits, at the head of which she has placed him. Religious without bigotry, of an independent but contented mind, learned though modest, warm hearted and impassioned in his feelings, and, at the same time, chaste and pure in his thoughts, indul gent and generous, calm and reflective ; his muse partakes of all these qualities. At times she soars in the highest regions of lyric poetry, but oftener sings her pensive strains in the elegiac tone. In the mild ness of his sentiments Pindemonte resembles Parini. His works are of different kinds, and all es teemed for the purity of their language, and for the frequent poetical beauties contained in them. X2"], [646, "308 TREATISE ON MODERN He has written some rural sketches, called Prose e Poesie Campestri, and these, I believe, were among his earliest works. He afterwards under took the translation of Homer's Odyssey, of which he published some cantos. He also wrote a tragedy, L' Arminio, in which he has mixed the ancient and modern dramatic styles, and intro duced chorusses, in which he displays his natural genius for the boldness of lyric composition. Pindemonte had early travelled through the Italian peninsula, and to the Italian islands, espe cially to Sicily, of which beautiful country he speaks with fond recollection, in his epistle to Ugo Foscolo, in reply to the Sepolcri of the latter : Foscolo, e vero, il regno ampio de' venti Io corsi a' miei verdi anni, e il mar Sicano Solcai non una volta, e a quando ii quando Con pie leggier dalla mia fida barca Mi lanciava in quel? isola, ove Ulisse Trovo i Ciclopi, io donne oneste e belle. Cose ammirande cola vidi * * * He visited also England, and there he imbibed that esteem and jjredilection for the English nation, which he has retained in the bosom of his native country, after long absence, and through all poli tical vicissitudes. In the already-mentioned Epistle on the Se pulchres, while praising the custom and appear-"], [647, "ITALIAN LITERATURE. 309 ance of the country church-yards in England, he takes an opportunity of launching into a flight of praises on the rural beauties of England, and of English country seats and parks, among which he wishes himself again, to breathe in peace far from the din of war which then raged over the Continent. Deh ! perche non poss' io tranquilli passi Muover ancor per quelle vie, celarmi Sotto l'intreccio ancor di que' frondosi Rami ospitali, e udir da lungi appena Mugghiar del mondo la tempesta, urtarsi L' un contro ? altro popolo, corone spezzarsi E scettri ? Oh quanta strage ! Oh quanto Scavar di fosse, e traboccar di corpi, E ai Condottier trafitti alzar di tombe! In his Sermoni, or Discourses, a sort of didactic composition, mixed with mild satire, which he published in 1818, Pindemonte displays to us his mind and his principles. Averse to political strife, having witnessed the misfortunes which the violence of party-spirit had brought upon his unhappy country, expecting nothing but greater evils from further changes, at least in his life-time, he, like many other of his countrymen, deprecates that mania for political squabbles which, in Italy at least, has done little mere, for thirty years past, than create confusion, and increase the sum of misery. Pindemonte begins his Sermone on poli-"], [648, "310 TREATISE ON MODERN tical opinions by a version of those lines of Gold smith's \" Traveller:\" In ev'ry government, though terror reign, Though tyrant kings, or tyrant laws restrain, How small of that which human hearts endure, That part which laws or kings can cause or cure. These lines are thus rendered : Sotto qualunque reggimento uom viva Benche regni il terror, benchfi Ia gente Frenin tiranne Leggi o Re tiranni, Quanto de' mali, onde il cor nostro geme, Scarsa parte e ci6 mai, ehe i Re, o le Leggi O ponno in noi causare, o sanar ponno ! \" And who is it that talks thus?\" asks Pindemonte. \" Is it a vile slave, the flatterer of an absolute power, under which he was born ? No ! it is the citizen of a country where the monarch's will is restrained by ancient and by modern boundaries, it is a soul frank and generous, a lover of liberty as much as of the Muses. Oh, blind human race, always in genious to find out means to torm,ent thyself ! One man imagines a civil state of society in which alone he fancies that his days would glide along in perfect happiness. And I also,\" says Pindemonte, \" I can distinguish also between gold and dung ; I too perceive that there is much difference between being born an Englishman or a Turk.

The circumstance that gave occasion to this little poem was the recent establishment of guards on the summit of the lofty steeple of St. Mark at Venice, who are watching from thence night and day, should any fires break out in that vast city. * Probably he means here Countess Albrizzi. See the last words of her portrait of Pindemonte."], [653, "315 ITALIAN LITERATURE. To show their vigilance, these guards are obliged to strike the great bell at every quarter of an hour. This the poet considers as a warning voice addressed to the citizens. He thus begins : S ii ? antica di Marco eccelsa Torre Ad ogni quarta porzion d' un ora La tremenda sua voce udir fa. il Tempo.

He then proceeds to warn his countrymen to make a proper use of that time which the bell of St. Mark's tower seems to measure out to them in such an impressive manner.

Pindemonte 's muse is essentially moral, but mild ; pensive, but not gloomy. He seems little inclined to take a part in political concerns. He probably disco vers errors in every party ; but he is not, therefore, the less useful to his countrymen. Good writers in every branch are to be appreciated ; every one (and lucky it is) is not called upon to be a politician, no more than to be a moralist, but yet both moralists and politicians are eminently valuable. I shall only add, that it were desirable that Pin demonte's philosophy should be a little more gene rally spread in these troublesome times, especially in Italy. We should then not see so many valu able persons obliged to exile themselves from their homes, without being able to do any good to their country. Italy has produced of late several good fabu lists, a branch of letters which had been compa ratively neglected. Pignotti, Roberti, Passeroni, Bertola, Clasio, (Fiacchi,) Decoureil, and De Rossi, have written fables and apologues in verse. Pignotti and Bertola are the two principal ones. The first is better known for his history of Tus-"], [657, "319 ITALIAN LITERATURE. cany, which, with Micali's \" History of Italy before the Dominion of the Romans,\" are the two best historical works Italy has produced in our days. Aurelio Bertola of Rimini had a natural flow of easy and elegant verse. Some of his fables are very pretty, their versification is soft and musical ; his style is not however always sufficiently natural and simple as becomes that sort of composition ; it is at times too epigrammatic ; some of his fables resemble too much the ariette of Metastasio. The following are specimens of them \u2014 the first is upon the old dispute between blue eyes and dark eyes :\u2014 GLI OCCHI AZZUUM E GLI OCCHI NERI.

In one of these, addressed from Naples to Ippolito Pindemonte, he thus de scribes that then rising genius: E di mezzo al poetico Fulgore in bei caratteri"], [659, "1TALIAM LITERATURE. 321 Veggo il tuo nobil core, Come allora il vid' io, Che parlo sul lattifluo Tuo labbro in mio favore Del? amistade il Dio.

Vol. II. V"], [660, "322 TREATISE ON MODERN Bertola wrote also epigrams ; an eulogium of Gessner, on which he bestowed particular pains ; an interesting account of a journey along the Rhine ; an essay on the philosophy of History ; in short, he was an universal writer ; but, as he says himself, he was chiefly adapted for soft and ele gant subjects. His excessive sensibility, his deli cate health, and the mobility of his imagination, prevented him from applying to more serious works. \" It seems,\" says the Countess Albrizzi of him, \" as if nature had intended to make him a perfect man, but repented when her work was half done.\" Among the Italian dialects the Sicilian is one of the most expressive, and best adapted for poetry : it abounds with diminutives, and with terms of en dearment ; its pronunciation is soft, and the mea sure of its words is well calculated for music. Several men of genius have enriched the Sicilian language with their poetical productions ; 1' Abate M\u00abli is the most eminent amongst them : his pas torals, odes, and songs, are full of fire and ten derness ; his images are taken from a beautiful nature ; and his expressions are delicate and graceful. I shall subjoin two extracts out of them : \u2014 '\u25a0 Sti silenzii, sta virdura Sti muntagni, sti vallati"], [661, "ITALIAN LITERATURE. 323 L' ha criate la natura Pri li cori innamurati.

This peculiar merit has been well supported in our times. Pignotti's History of Tuscany, Mi cali's History of Italy before the dominion of the Romans, Botta's History of the War of American Independence, and the vast undertaking of the History of Italy ancient and modern, by Luigi Bossi, are works that deserve to be mentioned, amongst a great number of others of subordinate merit in the same branch. Italian literature has also had many able biographers. The accurate and learned Tirabos chi, the acute and judicious Bettinelli, the elo quent Denina ; these have given histories of Italian literature ; also Corniani, of Brescia, has given us / Secoli della Letteratura Italiana dopo il suo risorgimento ; Mazzucchelli has written a work rich in erudition, De'' Scrittori d' Italia, part of which only is published ; the rest is in manu script, in the possession of his son; and very recently Camillo Ugoni, of Brescia, has written, also, upon \" Italian literature, during the latter"], [664, "326 . TREATISE ON MODERN half of the 18th century,\" as a continuation to Corniani's Secoli. Of the merits of this last work I have already spoken. Salfi has given a continu ation of Ginguene's literary history of Italy. Be sides which, the Literature of the different states of Italy has also had biographers; Foscarini for that of Venice, Napione for Piedmont, and others. Napoli Signorelli, of Naples, has given a history of the dramatic art ; Mayer has given the history of the origin, progress, and decline of music in Italy, since 1812. A number of men of letters have been of late zealously occupied in collecting, compiling, com menting upon, and illustrating the writings of the best Italian authors, either published or unpub lished before. Among these deserving men are to be mentioned, Custodi, Gamba, Ciampi, Reina, Barbieri, Biagioli, Buttura, and others. In the last century, Lanzi wrote the History of Italian Painters; and lately Count Cicognara, of Ferrara, has given us an excellent History of modern Sculpture. It cannot be said, therefore, as superficially-informed persons are apt to be lieve, that Italian literature, in our days, has dwindled to mere philological discussions about language. The great dispute about language however still continues between the Tuscans and theother Italians, especially those of the north. At the head of the"], [665, "327 ITALIAN LITERATURE. latter is Monti, the Nestor of Italian literature, who has written several volumes of corrections and additions to be made to the Dictionary of La Crusca*, which naturally dry subject he has found the means of rendering agreeable as well as at tractive. His cause seems founded upon reason, more so perhaps than that in which he upholds the exclusive dominion of classic literature against romanticism, to which he is averse. Thus, in literature, as well as in politics, a man may be liberal in one cause and absolute in another. Monti's son-in-law, Count Perticari, who died prematurely, was the active coadjutor in the phi lological labours of his father. With regard to the question of language, we find the following judicious remarks of the learned Acerbi, editor of the Biblioteca Italiana : \" La legge servile impostasi di non registrare ehe quelle voci in appoggio delle quali trovansi pronti gli esempi sotto le dita de' compilatori, e legge tirannica ed irragionevole. Una buona e valente autorita dovrebbe gia essere quella de' compilatori stessi raccolti a collegio per giudicare nel loro sinodo della bonta di un vocabolo: ben inteso pero ehe non di soli Bolognesi o Fiorentini, ma d' Italiani presi da ogni parte d' Italia fosse * Proposta di alcune Correzioni ed Aggiunte al Vocabolario della Crusca, Milano, 1821."], [666, "328 TREATISE ON MODERN composto un tal sinodo. II Dizionario dell' Acca demia di Parigi non ha testi, non ha citazioni, non ha autorita, tranne quella degli Accademici stessi . La definizione, la spiegazione, perfino Tapplicazione de' vocaboli e loro propria. Non pretendiamo per questo ehe si segua affatto 1' esern pio Francese, e giacche noi abbiamo un lavoro gia fattosull' appoggio degli esempi e de' testi, ritenia molo ; ma I' autorita sua non sia esclusiva, e non si tralascino centinaja e migliaja di voci ehe sono Italiane per indole, per necessita, per analogia, e ehe non furono accolte per la sola ragione ehe i compilatori mancarono pel momento di uua cita zione o di un esempio antico, ehe cantenesse in se quelle voci. \" Quanti vantaggi non ne trarrebbe la lingua da codesto consiglio Anfizionico ! Quante voci municipali non sarebbero fatte cittadine d' Italia, e giudicate degne d' esser' deposte nel magazzino universale della lingua ! Noi non applicheremo per intero il paragone de' dialetti diversi della Grecia alia nostra Penisola, ma crediamo ferma mente ehe ne' dialetti diversi d' Italia si trovino voci degne di arricchire il patrimonio generale della favella, perche, o precedenti da buone fonti, o perche presto intese anche da chi non le udi mai prima, o perche calzanti al segno da non aver altre voci ehe vi suppliscano senza perifrasi. Ne"], [667, "329 ITALIAN LITERATURE. daremo due soli esempi. In Milano, si usa dal popolo la voce sfollare, per contrario di affollare, e per esprimere lo calca di un gran teatro ehe uscendo va diradando la piena al di dentro. Chi negherebbe a questa voce la cittadinanza ? A Brescia, dove 1' idioma e cosi mozzo e barbaro, si usa con bel vezzo, e nel senso stesso del Latino, la voce pesundare per vilipendere. Sarebbero molti gli esempi di questo genere.\" And, lower down, speaking of the unavoidable influence of foreign conquest over the language of a nation : \u2014 \" La nostra lingua ha sentito 1' influsso della conquista, e quello ehe pare contraddittorio, essa prese nella servitu un andamento piii libero e piu disinvolto, ed essa formossi uno stile carat teristico del secolo, diverso affatto dalla supersti ziosa aridita de' trecentisti, e distinto ancora dalla servile imitazione de' buoni secoli ehe ven nero dorjo.\" Italian literature, rich so early in novelle or tales, in anecdotes and episodes, is extremely scanty in novels in which the whole character and life of the hero is sketched, or, romanzi in prosa, as they are called in Italian. Probably the facility of writing verse has dissuaded Italian writers from writing works of imagination in prose. Probably, also, the example of the Greeks and Romans, upon"], [668, "330 TREATISE ON MODERN which Italian literature was modelled, prevented its writers from applying to a species of composi tion for which they had no example in the ancient languages. Whatever may be the reason, the fact is, that, with the exception of the Lettere d' Ortis, Italy has hardly a real original novel, to be compared to the numerous productions of the kind which England, Germany, France, and Spain, have produced. The facility of translating and imitating the latter, may be another reason why nothing original of this sort has been produced by an Italian pen. Certainly the country that has given to the world the Inferno, Innamorato, Mor gante, Gerusalemme, Furioso, and so many other original poems, cannot be suspected to be un productive of imaginations rich enough to write a good work of fancy in prose. Of late years, several writers have tried the untrodden path of novel-writing ; among the rest, Sacchi and Bertolotti are those who have given the best grounded hopes of succeeding in this undertaking . The former has published, in 1822, a novel called Oriele, or, Letters of two Lovers ; the second, who has written several works of light and elegant literature, also sketched a short novel called 1' Isoletta de' Cipressi. Unfortunately both these novels end by suicide. Yet, notwithstanding these essays, it seems that the appearance of a good Italian novel remains still a desideratum."], [669, "331 ITALIAN LITERATURE. That branch of oratory which is devoted to the pulpit, although cultivated in Italy by many, cannot be said to have flourished in that country within the last fifty years. Bishop Turchi, of Parma, is one of the few preachers who has supported the dignity of Italian pulpit-eloquence. His works, consisting of sermons, homilies, and funeral orations, were jDublished at Venice, 1815, in five volumes. Another collection of his inedited works has been since published at Modena, 1818, in six volumes. His ideas are glowing, and often elevated, and his composition is rapid and ani mated. His style, however, and still more his language, are neglected. Turchi entered, in early youth, the order of St. Francis ; became, through his merit, known to the Duke of Parma, who ap pointed him chaplain to his court ; after which he was intrusted with the education of the Infante Don Ludovico, afterwards, for a short time, King of Etruria. Turchi was subsequently appointed to the episcopal see of Parma. He died in 1803, at the advanced age of eighty. In the other parts of rhetoric, such as pane gyrics and academical orations in eulogy of illus trious individuals, a number of men of letters have distinguished themselves. One of the most conspi cuous in our days is Pietro Giordani of Piacenza, one of the first contributors to the Biblioteca Italiana ."], [670, "332 TREATISE ON MODERN This writer is remarkable for the purity and sim plicity of his style, the independence of his thoughts, and the moderation and uprightness of his principles. His works upon different sub jects, containing orations, criticisms, historical dis sertations, translations, fye, have been lately pub lished in seven volumes. Antonio Benci, one of the contributors to the other Italian periodical, 1' Antologia, deserves to be mentioned honour ably in the same line. He has published lately an excellent translation of Schiller's Thirty Years' War. Passing from literature, so properly called, to those branches of it which are more scientific, we shall only observe, that in the last century, Vico and Genovesi brought sound principles to the discussion of rational philosophy. Some branches of this science have been lately illus trated by Delfico, Montrone, Talia, and others. In political economy, Pietro Verri, Carli, and Galiano, in the last century, distinguished them selves. Many more there have been in our times, and of different colours and shades of opinion One of the principal Italian economists of our days, is Gioja of Piacenza. He wrote seve ral political works during the Cisalpine and Italian republics. But his great work, which has acquired him universal reputation, is styled Nuovo"], [671, "333 ITALIAN LITERATURE. Prospetto delle Scienze economiche, being an ex position of all theoretical as well as practical principles in every branch of private and public administration, divided into classes and united in a general system. In a few volumes he has un dertaken to collect the substance of all that has been written on this subject, of the laws of the different governments, and of the custom of nations with regard to administration. This is a very succinct account of Italian litera ture. Many deserving names have been omitted, for the sake of that brevity which was a necessary quality of this treatise ; but it will, at least, serve to show that the field is vast, and that there is much to be reaped from it. I shall conclude in the words of Antonio Benci, him self one of the supporters of his country's literary honours, that Italy is far, very far, from being \" Qual grido stolto il suona,\" merely the land of the dead.
