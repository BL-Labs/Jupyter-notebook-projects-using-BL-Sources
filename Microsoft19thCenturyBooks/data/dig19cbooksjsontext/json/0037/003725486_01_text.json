The depredations committed on our commerce in the Mediterranean, by the piratical corsairs of the Barbary powers, induced Congress, in 1 794, to undertake the formation of a naval force for its protection. Four ships, of forty-four guns each, and two of thirty-six, were ordered to be built. The act, authorizing the construction of these ships, passed the twenty-seventh day of March, which may be considered as the day that gave existence to the navy of the United States. The creation and establishment of a permanent and efficient naval force, for the protection of com merce and the defence of the seacoast in case of war, had always been advocated by Mr. John Adams ; and during the term of his presidency, from March, 1797, to March, 1801, the object was pursued with great zeal and energy. To no indi vidual is the nation more indebted, than to Mr. Adams ; and posterity will hail him as the father OF THE AMERICAN NAVY. In 1798, there were in service twenty vessels ; in 1799, upwards of thirty. A law was passed, directing the building of six seventy-four gun ships, which, however, was never carried into effect. In 1801, the navy consisted of the following ships:"], [27, "11 NAVAL TEMPLE.

CAPTAIN THOMAS TRUXTON Was one of the first six captains appointed by the President, at the organization of the naval es tablishment, in 1794. He was directed to superin tend the building of the Constellation, of 36 guns, at Baltimore, and to take the command of her when equipped. The commerce of the United States having sufc fered much from the ravages of the French, both in"], [28, "12 NAVAL TEMPLE. national vessels and privateers, Captain Truxton was sent with a squadron to the West Indies for its protection. On the ninth of February, 1799, at noon, the island of Nevis bearing w. s. w. five leagues dis tant, the Constellation being then alone, a large ship was discovered to the southward, which proved to be the French frigate Insurgente, of forty guns and four hundred and seventeen men. Commodore Truxton bore down upon her, and, at a quarter past three, ranging along side, poured a broadside into her, which was immediately returned. After a Warm action of an hour and a quarter, the French ship struck : twenty-nine of her crew were killed, and forty-four wounded. The Constellation had only one man killed, and two wounded. On the first of February, 1 800, the Constellation being alone in the road of Basseterre, at half past seven a. m. Guadaloupe bearing eastward, about five leagues distant, a sail was discovered, which, on approaching, commodore Truxton ascertained to be a heavy French frigate, of fifty-four guns. He im mediately prepared his ship for action. He contin ued the chase till one the next day, when a fresh wind enabled him to gain upon her. At eight in the evening, having got within hail, he hoisted his en sign ; had all the candles in the battle lanterns light ed ; and was in the lee gang way, ready to speak to the French ship, when she commenced a fire from her stern and quarter guns at the rigging of the Con stellation. Having repeated the orders he had"], [29, "13 NAVAL TEMPLE. before given, commodore Truxton, in a few mo ments gained a position on the weather of the French ship, which enabled him effectually to return her broadside. After a close and severe action of about four hours, the fire of the French ship was completely silenced, and she sheered off, at the moment when Truxton considered her as his prize, and had ordered the tattered sails of the Constellation to be trimmed. It was then per ceived that the main-mast was totally unsupported by rigging, every shroud having been shot away. All efforts to support the mast were useless ; it went over the side in a few minutes, carrying all the top men with it.* Before the ship could be cleared of the shattered fragments, which was accomplished in about an hour, the French ship had effected her escape. Her disappearance was so sudden, that, the people on board the Constellation supposed she had sunk. She arrived at Curracoa, five days after the engagement, so shattered, that all her crew were continually employed at the pumps to keep her from sinking. She had one hundred and sixty men killed and wounded. Her captain stated that he had twice struck his colours; but, owing to the darkness, it was not perceived on board the Con- stellation. Believing it was the determination of * James Jarvis, of New-York, a midshipman, commande3 the main-top.

The Constellation had thirty-nine men killed and wounded. The French frigate was the Vengeance. CAPTAIN LITTLE.\u2014 FRIGATE BOSTON. The United States frigate Boston, commanded by captain Little, being on a cruise, to protect the American commerce in the West Indies, in latitude 22, 50, longitude 51, captured, on the 12th of Octo- ber, 1800, after an action of an hour and forty minutes, the French national corvette Le Berceau. The Boston mounted twenty-four 12, and eight 9 pounders, and had two hundred and thirty men, of whom six were killed, and eight wounded. Le Berceau was commanded by captain Senes, had twenty-two 9, and two 12 pounders, on one deck, and two hundred and thirty men. She lost all her masts, and was otherwise much disabled. She had been out from Cayenne twenty-five days, during which she had plundered two American vessels and made prize of one. On a former cruise she had captured several American vessels. A variety of circumstances conspired to render this capture of much importance. Le Berceau was considered one of the fastest sailing corvettes in the French navy; she served as a look-out vessel to the French fleet for eighteen months, had frequently been chased"], [31, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 15 by British cruisers, but never overtaken ; and had been very successful in capturing British, American, and Portuguese vessels ; and was bound on this cruise to intercept the American Indiamen, and South American ships. Captain Senes had been post captain in the French navy for many years ; was a midshipman in count D'Estaing's fleet in the revolutionary war ; and was esteemed a brave and intelligent officer. Le Berceau lost in the engage ment her first lieutenant, master, boatswain, master gunner, and pilot, besides a number of seamen. Captain Senes, and a commissioner, who was in Le Berceau, after being in the Boston fifteen days, were, at their request, permitted to go toBarbadoes, on their parole. The Boston expended upwards of 27 cwt. of powder, upwards of 1500 round shot, besides double that number of chain, double-headed, and grape, during the action. Captain Little arrived, with hi* prize, at Boston, the 14th of November. CAPTAIN STERRETT. In the month of August, 1801, Captain Sterretl, commander of the United States schooner Enter prize, of twelve guns, and ninety men, fell in, oft Malta, with a Tripolitan cruiser of fourteen guns and eighty-five, men. A desperate conflict en sued, and had continued for nearly two hours,"], [32, "16 NAVAL TEMPLE. when the Tripolitan hauled down her colours. The crew of the Enterprize left their guns, and gave three , cheers for the victory. Upon this, the cruiser poured a broadside into the Enter prize, hoisted her colours, and renewed the action with redoubled vigour. Her crew, brandishing their sabres, continually attempted to board. They were again overcome by the skilful crew of the En terprize, and struck a second time. Captain Ster rett then ordered the cruiser under his quarter, and kept his men at the guns. But the Tripolitan had no sooner come to the position she was ordered, than she renewed the action the third time, by pour ing a broadside into the Enterprize. The Tripoli tans hoisted their bloody flag, and attempted to board. The indignant cry of \" Fight on, and sink the perfidious villains to the bottom,\" was now heard from every part of the American schooner. Every effort was made by Captain Sterrett to ensure a complete victory. His superior skill in the man agement of his vessel enabled him to rake the cor sair, fore and aft. A number of shot between wind and water, opened her sides for the sea to pour in. Fifty of her men were killed and wounded. Her treacherous commander, perceiv ing the destruction of his vessel and crew inevit able, implored for quarters. Bending in a sup plicating posture over the waste of his vessel, he threw his colours into the sea, to convince the American captain that he would no more attempt to resist.

His instructions not permitting him to make a prize of the cruiser, he ordered her crew to throw overboard all their guns, swords, pistols, ammunition, &c. and then to go and tell their countrymen the treatment they might expect from a nation, determined to pay tribute only in powder and ball. The Enterprize, in this engagement of three hours, did not lose a man. Captain Sterrett, after paying every attention to the wounded Tripolitans, ordered the cruiser to be dismantled. Her masts were cut down. A spar was raised, to which was hung a tattered sail, as a flag. In this condition she was sent to Tripoli. On her arrival there, the indignation, excited by her defeat, was so great, that the bashaw ordered the wounded captain to be mounted on a jack-ass, and paraded through the streets as an object of publick scorn ; and then to receive five hundred bastinadoes. The Tripolitans were so terrified at this event, that the sailors aban doned the cruisers then fitting out. Not a man could be procured to navigate them.* * History of the war between the United States and Tripoli p. 91. 3"], [36, "18 NAVAL TEMPLE. SCHOONER EXPERIMENT.\u2014 LIEUTENANT STEWART. In July, 1800, lieutenant Charles Stewart was appointed to the command of the Experiment, of twelve guns, and ordered to cruise in the West In dies. He arrived on that station the first of Sep tember, and the same night fell in with the French schooner Deux Amis, of eight guns, which he en gaged and captured, without any loss, after an action of ten minutes. Soon after, Avhile cruising near the island of Barbuda, he discovered a brig of war, and a three masted schooner, standing for the Experiment, under a press of sail, and displaying English colours. The Experiment was hove to, and the British signal of the day was made, which not being answered by the strange vessels by the time they were within gun-shot, that signal was hauled down, and the Experiment stood away with all sail set. A chase was now commenced by the enemy, and continued for about two hours ; when finding they were outsailed by the Experiment, they relinquish ed the pursuit, and bore away under easy sail, firing a gun to windward, and hoisting French colours. Lieutenant Stewart now man\u0153uvred his schooner so as to bring her in the enemy's wake, to windward, when a chase was made on his part, which contin ued the whole day before the wind, each vessel crowding all her canvass. At eight o'clock at night,"], [37, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 19 the Experiment closed with the three-masted schooner, which was the sternmost of the hostile vessels ; and having taken a position on her lar board-quarter, opened a fire upon her from the great. guns and small arms, which in about five minutes, compelled her to strike. She was immediately taken possession of, and proved to be the French schooner of war Diana, of fourteen guns and sixty five men, commanded by M. Peraudeau, lieutenant de Vaisseau. The detention occasioned by re moving the prisoners, enabled the brig of war to escape. She mounted, as was afterwards learned, eighteen guns, and had a crew of one hundred and twenty men. The Experiment proceeded to St. Christopher's with her prize. On the 1 4th of December, she fell in with the privateer Flambeau, of sixteen guns and ninety men, with a prize brig, steering for Marigalante. The breeze being light and the enemy to wind ward, it was late in the afternoon before there was any prospect of closing with him. Notwithstanding all the exertions of the Experiment, the Flambeau escaped in shore ; but her prize was retaken. This vessel proved to be the Zebra of and from Balti more, laden with flour. During the remainder of this cruise, the Experiment recaptured several American vessels, sometimes as many as two or three in a day, and thus rescued American pro perty to a considerable amount."], [38, "20 NAVAL TEMPLE. OPERATIONS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN. As every incident and anecdote connected with the Tripolitan war has become extremely interest ing to the publick, we trust that the following cir cumstantial, though very imperfect, narrative of the operations of the squadron under Commodore Preble, will be read with satisfaction. The Tripolitan cruisers continuing to harass the vessels of the United States, Congress deter mined, in 1803, to act wrth greater vigour against them, and to fit out a fleet that should not only repel their unprovoked aggression, but also chastise their insolence. The squadron consisted of the Constitution, 44 guns ; the Philadelphia, 44 ; the Argus, 18; the Syren, 16; the Nautilus, 16; the Vixen, 16; and the Enterprize, 14. Commodore Preble was appointed to the command of this squadron, in May, 1803. On the thirteenth of August, commodore Preble Bailed in the Constitution for the Mediterranean. On his passage he brought to a Moorish frigate, which he suspected had been authorized to cruise against American vessels ; but her papers not sup porting such a suspicion, he dismissed her. When he arrived at Gibraltar, he found that our affairs with Morocco had assumed a very disagreeable aspect."], [39, "21 NAVAL temple. Captain William Bainbridge, commanding the frigate Philadelphia, had sailed in July; and, on the twenty-sixth of August, had captured the Moorish ship Mirboha, of twenty-two guns, and one hundred and ten men. An order to cruise for American vessels was discovered among her papers. There was no signature to this order. The captain said it was delivered to him sealed, by the Moorish governour of Tangiers, who ordered him not to open it until at sea. By the authority of this order he had captured the American brig Celia, then in company. In May, captain Rodgers had detained a vessel, under Moorish colours, at tempting to enter Tripoli, then actually blockaded by him. On board of her were four guns, and other contraband articles. The emperour denied having authorized the latter ; and the governour of Tangiers disavowed having given any orders to cruise for Americans to the former. Commodore Preble, the day after his arrival, wrote to the Ame rican consul at Tangiers, that peace with the em perour of Morocco was desirable ; that since he disavowed the acts of hostility, committed by his subjects, he should punish as pirates all Moorish cruisers attempting to capture American vessels.* Commodore Rodgers, who, with the New York and John Adams, frigates, was under orders to return to the United States, consented to remain a few days on the station, and to proceed with com modore Preble to Tangier bay, to effect an adjust ment of existing differences. * Port Folio, vol. iii. p. 361."], [40, "22 NAVAL TEMPLE. On the seventeenth of August, commodore Preble appeared in Tangier bay, and hoisted a white flag in token of peace. The American consul was not permitted to go on board. Two sentinels were placed at his door. About this time another act of hostility was com mitted at Mogadore. It was an order given to detain all American vessels. The brig Hannah, of Salem, was actually seized. This determined the commodore to take a more decided course. He ordered his squadron to bring in all Moorish vessels for examination. He des patched vessels to cruise off Mogadore, Salee, Za rach and Tetuan, while he himself entered the bay of Tangiers from time to time. The Philadelphia and Vixen were ordered to lie before Tripoli. On the 5th of October, when the emperour of Morocco was expected at Tangiers, commodore Preble anchored the Constitution and Nautilus in the bay, within half a mile of the circular bat tery. In the afternoon of the 6th, he was joined by the frigates New York and John Adams. The ships were constantly kept clear for action, and the men night and day at their quarters. The emperour arrived on the 6th, with a great body of troops, who encamped on the beach opposite the American squa dron. The commodore saluted the emperour with twenty-one guns, which wTere returned by an equal number from the fort. A present of bullocks, sheep, and fowls, was sent to the American squa dron, as a token of the emperour's good will. On"], [41, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 23 the 8th, the emperour, attended by a body of troops, came to the beach for the purpose of viewing the American squadron. The Constitution again com plimented him with twenty-one guns, with which he was much gratified. The next day the American consul informed the commodore that the emperour had given orders for the American brig, detained at Mogadore, to be re leased; and that he would give audience to the American commodore and consul on the following Monday. On the day appointed, the commodore, accompa nied by four persons, went on shore. He ordered the officer, commanding the squadron during his absence, to fire upon the town, if he should be forcibly detained; and not to enter into any treaty for his release, nor be influenced by any considera tions for his personal safety. When arrived at the castle, they were conducted through a double file of soldiers to the emperour. The commodore, on entering, was requested to put away his side arms ; with this he declined complying; and was permit ted to retain them. The emperour expressed much sorrow and regret that any difference had arisen ; for it was his desire to be at peace with the Unit ed States. He denied having given any hostile orders; promised to restore all American vessels and property, detained by the authority of any of his governours; and renewed and confirmed the treaty made with the United States in 1786. The commodore and consul, on the part of the United"], [42, "24 NAVAL TEMPLE. States, promised that the vessels and property be longing to the emperour, should be restored ; and the orders for capturing them revoked. Commodore Preble was now at liberty to direct his whole attention to Tripoli. The season was, however, too far advanced for active operations. On the 31st of October, the Philadelphia, being, at nine o'clock in the morning, about five leagues to the westward of Tripoli, discovered a sail in shore, standing before the wind to the eastward. - The Philadelphia immediately gave chase. The sail hoisted Tripolitan colours, and continued her course near the shore. The Philadelphia opened a fire upon her, and continued it, till half past eleven ; when, being in seven fathoms water, and finding her fire could not prevent the vessel entering Tripoli, she gave up the pursuit. In beating off, she ran on a rock, not laid down in any chart, distant four and a half miles from the town. A boat was imme diately lowered to sound. The greatest depth of water was found to be astern. In order to back her off, all sails were then laid aback ; the top-gallant sails loosened ; three anchors thrown away from the bows ; the water in the hold started ; and all the guns thrown overboard, excepting a few abaft to defend the ship against the attacks of the Tripoli tan gun-boats, then firing at her. All this, how ever, proved ineffectual ; as did also the attempt to lighten her forward by cutting away her foremast. The Philadelphia had already withstood the attack of the numerous gun-boats for four hours, when a"], [43, "25 NAVAL TEMPLE. large reinforcement coming out of Tripoli, and being herself deprived of every means of resistance, and defence, she was forced to strike, about sun set. The Tripolitans immediately took possession of her, and made prisoners of the officers and men, in number three hundred. Forty-eight hours after wards, the wind blowing in shore, the Tripolitans got the frigate off, and towed her into the harbour. On the 14th of December, commodore Preble sailed from Malta, in company with the Enterprize, commanded by lieutenant Stephen Decatur. On the 23d, the latter captured a ketch in sight of Tripoli; which place she had left the preceding night, bound to Bengaza. She was under Turkish colours, and was navigated by Turks and Greeks. On board of her were two Tripolitan officers of dis tinction, a number of Tripolitan soldiers, and about forty blacks belonging to the bashaw and his sub jects. The commodore had at first determined to release the vessel and men claimed by the Turkish captain ; and only detain the Tripolitans, about sixty in number, as prisoners. But before this de termination could be put in execution, he ascertain ed, that this same captain had been very active in assisting to take the Philadelphia. He had, on that occasion, received on board his vessel one hundred armed Tripolitans ; had changed his own colours for that of the enemy ; had attacked the frigate ; and, when she was boarded, had plundered the offi cers. This determined the commodore to retain the vessel. As she was in no condition to be sent t"], [44, "26 NAVAL TEMPLE. to the United States, he forwarded her papers t\u00a9 government. Soon after he had her appraised; and took her into the service as the ketch Intrepid. When lieutenant Decatur was informed of the loss of the Philadelphia, he immediately formed a plan of recapturing or destroying her, which he proposed to commodore Preble. At first the com modore thought the projected enterprise too hazard ous ; but at length granted his consent. Lieutenant Decatur then selected for the enterprise the ketch Intrepid, lately captured by him. This vessel he manned with seventy volunteers, chiefly of his own crew ; and on the third of February sailed from Syracuse, accompanied by the brig Siren, lieuten ant Stewart. The Siren was to aid the boats ; and, in case it should be deemed expedient to use the Intrepid as a fire ship, to receive her crew. After a tempestuous passage of fifteen days, the two vessels arrived off the harbour of Tripoli, to wards the close of day. It was determined that at ten o'clock in the evening the Intrepid should enter the harbour, accompanied by the boats of the Siren. But a change of wind had separated the two vessels six or eight miles. As delay might prove fatal, lieutenant Decatur entered the harbour alone about eight o'clock. The Philadelphia lay within half gun shot of the Bashaw's castle and principal battery. On her starboard quarter lay two Tripo litan cruisers within two cables length ; and on the starboard bow a number of gun-boats within half gun-shot. All her guns were mounted and loaded."], [45, "27 NAVAL TEMPLE. Three hours were, in consequence of the lightness of the wind.Tonsumed in passing three miles, when, being within two hundred yards of the Philadelphia, they were hailed from her, and ordered to anchor on peril of being fired into. The pilot on board the Intrepid was ordered to reply, that all their anchors were lost. The Americans had advanced within fifty yards of the frigate, when the wind died away into a calm. Lieutenant Decatur ordered a rope to be taken out and fastened to the fore chains of the frigate, which was done, and the Intrepid was warped along side. It was not till then the Tripoli- tans suspected them to be an enemy ; and their con- fusion in consequence was great. As soon as the vessels were sufficiently near, lieutenant Decatur sprang on board the frigate, and was followed by midshipman Morris.* It was a minute before the remainder of the crew succeeded in mounting after them. But the Turks, crowded together on the quarter deck, were in too great consternation to take advantage of this delay. As soon as a sufficient number of Americans gained the deck, they rushed upon the Tripolitans, who were soon overpowered ; and about twenty of them were killed. After taking possession of the ship, a firing commenced from the Tripolitan batteries and castle, and from two corsairs near the frigate ; a number of launches were also seen rowing about in the har bour; whereupon lieutenant Decatur resolved to * Now Captain Morris,"], [46, "28 NAVAL TEMPLE. remain in the frigate, for there he would be enabled to make the best defence. But perceiving that the launches kept at a distance, he ordered the frigate to be set on fire, which was immediately done, and so effectually, that with difficulty was the Intrepid preserved. A favourable breeze at this moment sprung up, which soon carried them out of the har bour. None of the Americans were killed, and only four wounded. For this heroick achievement lieutenant Decatur was promoted to the rank of post captain. His commission was dated on the day he destroyed the Philadelphia. After the destruction of the Philadelphia frigate, commodore Preble was, during the spring and early part of the summer, employed in keeping up the blockade of the harbour of Tripoli, in preparing for an attack upon the town, and in cruising. A prize that had been taken was put in commission, and called the Scourge. A loan of six gun-boats and two bomb-vessels, completely fitted for service, was obtained from the king of Naples. Permission was also given to take twelve or fifteen Neapoli tans on board each boat, to serve under the Ameri can flag. With this addition to his force, the commodore, on the 21st of July, joined the vessels off Tripoli. His squadron then consisted of the Frigate Constitution, 44 guns, 24 pounders, Brig Argus, 18 24 Syren, 18 18 Scourge,"], [47, "29 JTAVAL TEMPLB. Schooner Vixen, ' 16 6 Nautilus, 16 6 Enterprize, 12 6 Besides six gun-boats, carrying each a twenty-six brass pounder, and two bomb-ketches, carrying each a thirteen inch mortar. The number of men en p-ao-ed in the service amounted to one thousand and sixty. On the Tripolitan castle and batteries, one hun dred and fifteen guns were mounted : fifty-five of which were pieces of heavy ordnance ; the others long eighteen and twelve pounders. In the harbour were nineteen gun-boats, carrying each a long brass eighteen or twenty-four pounder in the bow, and two howitzers abaft : also two schooners of eight guns each, a brig of ten, and two galleys, of four guns each. In addition to the ordinary Turkish garri son, and the crews of the armed vessels, estimated at three thousand, upwards of twenty thousand Arabs had been assembled for the defence of the city. The weather prevented the squadron from ap proaching the city until the 28th, when it anchored within two miles and a half of the fortifications ; but the wind suddenly shifting, and increasing to a gale, the commodore was compelled to return. On the 3d of August, he again approached to within two or three miles of the batteries. Having observed that several of the enemy's boats were stationed without the reef of rocks, covering the entrance of the har bour, he resolved to take advantage of this circum stance. He made signal for the squadron to come"], [48, "30 NAVAL TEMPLE. within speaking distance, to communicate to the several commanders his intention of attacking the shipping and batteries. The gun-boats and bomb- ketches were immediately manned, and prepared for action. The former were arranged in two divi- sions of three each. The first division was under the command of captain Somers, on board the boat No. 1 ; lieutenant James Decatur commanded the boat No. 2 ; and lieutenant Blake, No. 3. The second division was commanded by captain Deca- tur, in No. 4 ; lieutenant Bainbridge command- ed No. 5 ; and lieutenant Trippe No. 6. The two bomb-ketches were commanded, the one by lieutenant commandant Dent; the other by Mr. Robinson, first lieutenant of the commodore's ship. At half past one, the squadron stood in for the bat- teries. At two, the gun-boats were cast off. At half past two, signal was made for the bomb-ketches and gun-boats to advance and attack. At three quarters past two, the signal was given for a general action. It commenced by the bomb-ketches throw- ing shells into the town. A tremendous fire imme- diately commenced from the enemies batteries and vessels, of at least two hundred guns. It was im mediately returned by the American squadron, now within musket-shot of the principal batteries. At this moment, captain Decatur, with the three gun-boats under his command, attacked the enemy's eastern division, consisting of nine gun-boats. He wag soon in the midst of them. The fire of the cannon"], [49, "31 NAVAL TEMPLE. and musketry was immediately changed to a despe rate attack with bayonet, spear, sabre, &c. Captain Decatur having grappled a Tripolitan boat, and boarded her with only fifteen Americans; in ten minutes her decks were cleared, and she was cap tured. Three Americans were wounded. At this moment captain Decatur was informed that the gun boat commanded by his brother, had engaged and captured a boat belonging to the enemy ; but that his brother, as he was stepping on board, was treacherously shot by the Tripolitan commander, who made off with his boat. Captain Decatur im mediately pursued the murderer, who was retreat ing within the lines ; having succeeded in coming along side, he boarded with only eleven men. A doubtful contest of twenty minutes ensued. Deca tur immediately attacked the Tripolitan comman der, who was armed with a spear and cutlass. In parrying the Turk's spear, Decatur broke his sword close to the hilt, and received a slight wound in the right arm and breast ; but having seized the spear he closed ; and, after a violent struggle, both fell, Decatur uppermost. The Turk then drew a dag ger from his belt ; but Decatur caught hold of his arm, drew a pistol from his pocket, and shot him. While they were thus struggling, the crews of both vessels rushed to the assistance of their comman ders. And so desperate had the contest round them been, that it was with difficulty Decatur could ex tricate himself from the killed and wounded that had fallen around him. In this affair an American"], [50, "32 NAVAL TEMPLE. manifested the most heroick courage and attach. ment to his commander. Decatur, in the struggle, was attacked in the rear by a Tripolitan ; who had aimed a blow at his head, which must have proved fatal, had not this generous-minded tar, then dan gerously wounded, and deprived of the use of both his hands, rushed between him and the sabre, the stroke of which he received in his head, whereby his skull was fractured. This hero, however, sur vived, and now receives a pension from his grateful country. All the Americans but four were wound ed. Captain Decatur brought both his prizes safe to the American squadron. Lieutenant Trippe boarded one of the enemy's large boats, with only a midshipman, Mr. Jonathan Henly, and nine men ; his boat falling off before any more could join him. He was thus left either to perish, or to conquer thirty-six men, with only eleven. Though at first, the victory seemed doubt ful, yet, in a few minutes, the Tripolitans were sub dued ; fourteen of them were killed, and twenty two taken prisoners. Seven of these last were severely wounded. Lieutenant Trippe received eleven sabre wounds, some of them dangerous. The blade of his sword bending, he closed with his an tagonist. Both fell. In the struggle, Trippe wrested the Turk's sword from him, and, with it, stabbed him to the heart. Lieutenant Bainbridge had his lateen yards shot away. This rendered all his exertions to get along side the enemy's boats of no effect. But his"], [51, "33 NAVAL TEMPLE. brisk and well directed fire, within musket shot, did great execution. At one time his boat grounded within pistol shot of one of the enemy's batteries. He was there exposed to the fire of musketry ; but, by his address and courage, he extricated himself from his dangerous situation. Captain Somers was not able to get far enough to windward, to co-operate with Decatur. He, how ever, bore down upon the leeward division of the enemy. With his single boat, he attacked five full manned Tripolitan boats, within pistol shot. He defeated, and drove them in a shattered condition, and with the loss of many lives, to take refuge under the rocks. The two bomb vessels kept their station, and threw a great many shells into the town. Five of the enemy's gun-boats, and two galleys, composing their centre division, stationed within the rocks, being reinforced, and all joined by the gun-boats that had been driven in, twice attempted to row out and surround the gun-boats and prizes of the Ame ricans. They were, however, prevented by the vigilance of the commodore, who made signal for the brigs and schooners to cover them. This was properly executed by these vessels. Their conduct was excellent durino* the whole of the enpjao-e ment, and they annoyed the enemy exceedingly. The fire from the Constitution did considerable execution, and kept the enemy's flotilla in constant disorder. She was several times within two cables' length of the rocks, and three of the batteries. As 5"], [52, "34 NAVAL TEMPLE. soon as her broadside was brought to bear on any of the batteries, it was immediately silenced. But having no large vessels to secure these advantages, the fire was recommenced as soon as she changed her position. At half past four, the wind having inclined to the northward, and the enemy's flotilla having retreated to a station which covered them from the fire of the Americans, signal was made for the gun-boats and bombs to retire from the action. This was effect ed, and in fifteen minutes the squadron was out of the reach of the enemy's shot. The squadron was more than two hours within grape shot distance of the enemy's batteries, which kept up a constant fire. The damage sustained by the Americans was by no means proportionate to the apparent danger. The frigate Constitution was struck in her mainmast by a thirty-two pound ball, her sails and rigging were considerably cut, and one of her quarter-deck guns was injured by a round shot; not a man, however, was killed on board of her. The other vessels suf fered in their rigging, and had several men wound ed ; but none were killed, excepting lieutenant De catur. On the part of the enemy the effect of this engagement was very different. The boats cap tured by the Americans had one hundred and three men on board, forty-seven of whom were killed and twenty-six wounded. Three other boats were sunk with all the men on board of them. Numbers were also swept from the decks of the other vessels in the harbour. On shore, several Tripolitans were"], [53, "SAVAL TEMPLE. 35 killed and wounded ; a number of guns in the bat teries were dismounted ; and the town was conside- t rably injured. When the squadron was standing in for the attack, the bashaw affected to despise them. After having surveyed them from his palace, he said, \" they will mark their distance for tacking ; they are a sort of Jews, who have no notion of fighting.\" The palace and terraces of the houses were crowded with spec tators to behold the chastisement the bashaw's boats would give the American vessels if they approach ed too near. Momentary, however, was this exul tation. Scarcely had the battle commenced, when no one was to be seen, except at the batteries. Many of the inhabitants fled to the country: and the bashaw retreated to his bomb-proof room. On the 5th of August the commodore prevailed on a French privateer, that had left Tripoli in the morning, to return with eleven wounded Tripoli tans, whose wounds had been carefully dressed. The commodore also sent a letter to the bashaw's minister. The prisoners informed the prince, that the Americans in battle were fiercer than lions, but in the treatment of their prisoners, they were even more kind than the mussulmen. The bashaw at first misunderstood the motive of sending these men ; but when informed that it was done through mo tives of humanity, he professed to be pleased, and said that if he took any wounded Americans, he should, in like manner, restore them : but he would not release any of the crew of the Philadelphia."], [54, "36 NAVAL TEMPLE. On the 7th the privateer returned with a letter from the French consul, signifying, that the bashaw would probably treat on more reasonable terms. Nothing, however, definitive or satisfactory was proposed. The terms intimated were considerably higher than the commodore felt willing, or thought himself authorized to accept. He therefore pre pared for a second attack. The bomb-ketches, commanded by lieutenants Crane and Thorn, were to take a station in a small bay west of the town, where, without being much exposed, they might throw their shells with great effect. The gun-boats were to attack a seven gun battery. The brigs and schooners were to support them, in case the enemy's flotilla should venture out. At half-past two, the action commenced. In the course of two hours, six of the seven guns in the battery were silenced. During the action, forty-eight shells and about five hundred round shot were thrown into the town and batteries. The Tripolitan galleys man\u0153uvred to gain a position that might enable them to cut off the retreat of the American gun-boats; but the large vessels defeated their design. One of the American prize boats, taken in the first attack, was blown up by a red-hot shot from the battery passing through her magazine. She had on board twenty eight men, ten of whom were killed, and six wound ed : among the former were James \u2022Caldwell, first lieutenant of the Siren, and J. Dorsey, midshipman. Mr. Spence, midshipman, and eleven men, were taken up unhurt. When the explosion took place"], [55, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 37 this young officer was superintending the loading of a gun ; having discharged the piece, he with the survivers jumped into the sea. They were soon taken up by another boat. At eight in the evening of the same day, the John Adams, captain Chauncy, joined the squad ron. By him the commodore was informed, that four frigates were on their passage ; also, that by the appointment of a senior officer to one of the frigates, he would be superseded in his command. The government wras highly satisfied with the con duct of the commodore ; but had not a sufficient number of captains juniors to the commodore to supply all the frigates with commanders ; nor had information of his brilliant success as yet reached America. The John Adams having been sent out as a trans port, no assistance could, for the present, be received from her. All her guns wrere stowed by the kel son, and their carriages put away on board of the other frigates. As these last were all to sail four days after the John Adams, further operations were suspended in expectation of their arrival. On the 9th, the commodore reconnoitred the harbour, in the brig Argus. Next day a flag of truce was seen flying on the shore. The commo dore sent a boat, but which, however, was not per mitted to land her men. They returned with a let ter from the French consul. By it the commodore was informed that the bashaw would accept five hundred dollars for the ransom of each prisoner, and"], [56, "38 NAVAL TEMPLE. put an end to the war without any annuity for peace. The sum demanded amounted to about one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. This the com modore rejected ; but for the sake of the captives, and to prevent further effusion of blood, he offered eighty thousand dollars as ransom, and ten thou sand dollars as presents. The bashaw, however, suspended the negotiations, and said he would wait the result of another attack. On the night of the 23d, the bomb-ketches were sent under the protection of the gun-boats, to bom bard the town. The bombardment commenced at two a. m. and continued till daybreak ; but without much effect. The weather being favourable on the 27th, the commodore stood in for Tripoli, and anchored the Constitution two miles n. by e. from fort English. The light vessels kept under way. As a number of officers and seamen of the Constitution were em ployed in the boat, captain Chauncey, several of his officers, and about seventy seamen, volunteered their services on board her. The gun-boats, accompanied by the Siren, Ar gus, Vixen, Nautilus, Enterprize, and the boats of the squadron, anchored at three in the morning within pistol shot of the enemy's lines. With springs on their cables, they commenced a brisk fire on the shipping, town, batteries, and castle. It was warmly returned from the enemy's batteries. The boats of the squadron remained with the gun boats to assist in boarding the flotilla in case it"], [57, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 39 should come out. The brigs and schooners kept under way, to harass the enemy, and to support the gun-boats. At daylight, the commodore, appre hensive that the ammunition of the gun-boats might be nearly expended, weighed anchor, and stood in under the direct fire of fort English, and of the cas tle, crown and mole batteries. He made signal for the gun-boats to retire from action. Having ar rived at a good distance for firing at thirteen Tripo litan gun-boats and galleys, engaged with the Ame rican boats, he dicharged a broadside of round and grape shot at them. One of them was sunk ; two were disabled; and the remainder put to flight. The commodore then continued running in until within musket shot of the batteries. He hove to, fired three hundred round shot, besides grape and cannister, into the bashaw's castle, town and bat teries. The castle and two of the batteries were silenced. A little after six he hauled off. The gun-boats fired four hundred round shot, besides grape and cannister, apparently with much effect. The result of this attack was serious on shore. A thirty-six pound ball penetrated the castle, and en tered the apartment of the prisoners. Considerable damage was done to the houses. Several lives were lost. A boat from the John Adams, with a master's mate and eight men on board, was sunk by a double headed shot, which killed three seamen and badly wounded another. The French consul, immediately after the attack, renewed the negotiations for peace. They were."], [58, "40 NAVAL TEMPLE. however, broken off, in consequence, he thought, of one of the vessels of the squadron approaching the harbour as a cartel. This the bashaw inter preted as a proof of discouragement on the part of the Americans. On the 3d of September, the bomb-ketches being repaired, and also the damages sustained by the other vessels in the action of the 27th of August, the commodore resolved on another attack. The action commenced between three and four o'clock, and soon became general. As the American gun boats bore down, the boats and galleys gave way, and retreated under cover of the musketry, on shore. The brigs, schooners and gun-boats, pursued as far as the depth of the water would permit, and within musket shot of fort English. The action in this quarter was divided. The brigs and schooners, with one division of the gun-boats, eno-aged the fort. The other division continued engaged with the Tripolitan boats and galleys. The two bomb-ketches, while throwing their shells into the town, were exposed to a direct fire from the bashaw's castle, from the crown, mole, and several other batteries. The commodore, perceiv ing their danger, ran his ship between them and the batteries, within musket shot. Seventy guns were brought to bear on him from the batteries. But he discharged eleven broadsides with so much effect, that he silenced the principal batteries, and injured the others, and also the town considerably. The wind veering to the northward, and it beginning to"], [59, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 41 blow fresh, the commodore, at half past four p. m. gave signal to retire from the action under cover of the Constitution. Though the frigates and vessels were much damaged in this engagement, not a man was lost. The bomb-vessel, commanded by lieutenant Ro binson, had all her shrouds shot away, and was so much damaged in her hull, as to be with difficulty kept above water. The Argus received a thirty two pound ball in her hull. It cut away a lower cable as it entered, which so completely destroyed its force, that it fell upon the deck without doing any injury. Commodore Preble had for some time contem plated sending a fire-ship into the harbour, in order to destroy the flotilla, and injure the town. Cap tain Somers volunteered his services. He, with the assistance of lieutenants Wadsworth and Israel, fit ted out the ketch Intrepid for the expedition. One hundred barrels of gunpowder and one hundred and fifty shells were placed in the hold. Fusees and combustibles were so applied as not to endanger a retreat. On the evening of the 4th of September, captain Somers chose two fast-rowing boats, in order to bring off the people after the vessel should be set on fire. His own boat was manned by four men from the Nautilus and six from the Constitution, with lieutenant Wadsworth. At eight they parted from the squadron, and stood into the harbour. They were convoyed by the Argus, Vixen, and Nautilus, 6"], [60, "42 Naval temple. until arrived within a short distance from the bat teries. On entering the inner harbour, and near the point of her destination, the fire ship was board ed and carried by two galleys of one hundred men each. At this moment she exploded with the most awful effect. Every battery was silenced. Not a gun was fired during the remainder of the night. There is every reason to suppose that captain So mers, on perceiving no means of escape left, and that he should inevitably be doomed to an ignomin ious captivity, heroically resolved to die, and with his own hands set fire to the train, wrhen himself, his companions, and the enemy, met a common death. After this, nothing material occurred until Sep tember 9th, when the long expected squadron, under commodore Barron, joined the one before Tripoli. Here ended the command of commodore Preble, so honourable to himself and his country. All joined in praising his distinguished merit. The Pope made a publick declaration, that \" the United States, though in their infancy, had, in this affair, done more to humble the antichristian barbarians on that coast, than all the European states had done for a long series of time.\" Sir Alexander Ball, a distin guished commander in the British navy, addressed commodore Preble as follows : \u2014 \" I beg to repeat my congratulations on the services you have render ed your country, and the hair-breadth escapes you have had in setting a distinguished example. Your bravery and enterprise are worthy a great and rising nation. If I were to offer my opinion, it should be."], [61, "43 NAVAL TEMPLE. that you have done well not to purchase a peace with the enemy. A few brave men have indeed been sacrificed; but they could not have fallen in a better cause ; and I even conceive it advisable to risk more lives rather than submit to terms which might encourage the Barbary states to add fresh demands and insults.\" After the junction of the two squadrons, commo dore Preble obtained leave to return home. This he did with the greater pleasure, as it would give the command of a frigate to captain Decatur. On his return to the United States, he was received and treated every where with that distinguished atten tion, which he had so fully merited. Congress voted him their thanks, and requested the President to present him with an emblematical medal.* RENCOUNTER OF THE PRESIDENT AND LITTLE BELT. Pursuant to instructions from the navy depart ment, on the 10th of May, 1811, commodore Rod gers, commanding the frigate President, sailed from Annapolis for New York. On the 16th, about noon, and within six leagues from land, a sail was discovered to the eastward, standing towards the President. The commodore perceived it to be a man of war ; and supposed it to be the British fri gate Guerriere, which frigate, it was also supposed. * Clark's Naval History, vol. i. p. 148\u2014163."], [62, "44 NAVAL TEMPLE. had, a few days before, impressed a boy from on board an American brig, near Sandy Hook. Com modore Rodgers, considering: it his duty to know the names and character of all foreign vessels hover ing on the coast, resolved to speak to her. He also hoped, that, if she proved to be the Guerriere, he might prevail on her commander to relinquish the young man. At half past three, the commodore perceived his ship to be gaining upon the chase, but the wind decreasing, he did not come up with her till it was too dark to discover her actual force ; nor could he discover to what nation she belonged, as she declined showing her colours. At fifteen or twenty minutes past seven, the chase took in her studding sails, and soon after hauled up her courses. She then hauled by the wind on the starboard tack ; and, at the same time, hoisted an ensign or flag at her mizzen peak. It was, however, too dark to dis cover what nation it represented. Her broadside was now for the first time presented to view. Though her appearance indicated a frigate, dark ness prevented her actual force being ascertained. At twenty minutes past eight, the President being a little forward of the weather beam of the chase, and distant between seventy and a hundred yards from her, the commodore hailed, \" What ship is that ?\" To this no answer was given ; but the question was repeated from on board the chase. After a short pause, the question was repeated by the commodore, and immediately a shot was fired into the President. Just as the commodore was"], [63, "NAVAL TEMPLE, 45 about giving orders for a shot to be fired in return, one was actually fired from the second division of the President. This was returned from the other vessel, by three guns in quick succession, and, soon after, by the remainder of his broadside and mus ketry. The coinmodore then gave a general order to fire. The fire from the President having, in a few minutes, produced a partial silence of the guns of the other vessel, the commodore gave orders to cease firing, judging that she must be a ship of very inferiour force, or that some untoward accident had happened to her. This order commodore Rodgers soon had reason to regret. The fire was renewed from the other vessel, and two of its thirty-two pound shot cut off one of the fore shrouds, and injured the fore-mast of the President. He therefore immedi ately ordered a recommencement of the fire. It continued for a few minutes, when the commodore, perceiving his opponent's gaff' and colours down, his main-top-sail yard upon the cap, and his fire si lenced, again ordered the firing to cease, to prevent a further effusion of blood. After a short pause, perceiving his adversary was not disposed to renew the action, the commodore again hailed, and was informed that she was a British ship ; but, from the wind blowing fresh, he was unable to learn her name. Commodore Rodgers, having informed the Brit ish commander of the name of his ship, gave orders to wear ; to run under the lee of the British ship ; to haul bv the wind on the starboard tack ; to heave"], [64, "46 NAVAL TEMPLE. to under top-sails ; and repair the little damage that had been sustained in the rigging. The President continued lying to all night on different tacks, with lights displayed, that the Bri tish vessel might better discern her position, and command any assistance that she might require dur ing the night. At day light she was discovered several miles to leeward. The commodore gave orders to bear up and run down to her under easy sail. After hailing her, he sent a boat on board, with lieutenant Creighton, to learn the name of the ship and her commander, with instructions to ascertain the damage she had sustained, and to state how much he regretted, on his part, the necessity that led to so unhappy a result, and to offer every as sistance in his power, in repairing the damages. Lieutenant Creighton returned with information that the vessel was his Britannick majesty's ship Little Belt, captain Bingham, of eighteen guns ; and that the captain declined accepting any assistance. The Little Belt had nine men killed and twenty-two wounded. No one was killed on board the Presi dent, and only a boy wounded. Captain Bingham's account differs materially from the preceding statement. He denies having fired the first gun ; asserts that the action lasted three quarters of an hour; and even intimates that he had gained the advantage in the contest. Commodore Rodgers's account, from which the one here given is taken, was confirmed by all his officers and crew, on their solemn oath, before a court of inquiry."], [65, "47 NAVAL TEMPLE. The court also confirmed all the particulars of his statement, after a long and minute investigation.* THE PRESIDENT AND BELVIDERE. A formal declaration of war against Great Bri tain was passed by Congress on the 18th of June, 1812, which was proclaimed by the President of the United States on the following day. On the 21st, Commodore Rodgers, having received official in formation of the event, set sail from New York, accompanied by the frigates United States and Congress, and the brigs Hornet and Argus, in search of a British fleet of merchantmen, which had sailed from Jamaica the preceding month. The follow7 ing night information was received of the convoy from an American brig, which had passed them four days before, and the squadron crowded all sail in pursuit. The next morning, however, their course was altered by the appearance of the British frigate Belvidere, to which the commodore immediately gave chase. The pursuit continued from six in the morning, till past four in the afternoon, when the President, having got within gun-shot, commenced a tire with the bow chase guns at the spars and rig ging of the Belvidere, in hopes of crippling her so as to enable them to get along side. The Belvi dere returned the fire of the President with her * Clark's Naval History, vol. i. p. 168."], [66, "48 NAVAL TEMPLE. stern guns, and the firing was kept up without inter mission for about ten minutes, when one of the President's chase guns burst, by which unfortunate accident sixteen men were killed and wounded; among the wounded was commodore Rodgers, who had his leg fractured. By the bursting of the gun, and the explosion of the passing box, from which it was served with powder, both the main and fore castle decks were so much shattered as to prevent the use of a chase gun on that side for some time. Orders were therefore given to veer the ship, and a broadside was fired in the hope of disabling the spars of the enemy; but this did not succeed. Considerable damage, however, was done to the rig^ \u00a3ino- and the stern. The utmost exertion was now used on board the President, by wetting the sails, &c. to gain ground of her opponent ; but without success. A constant firing was kept up from both ships, until about seven o'clock ; when the Belvi dere, having cut away her anchors, started a num ber of water casks, and thrown overboard her boats and every thing that could be spared, got out of the reach of the President's shot. The chase was continued till about midnight, when it was given up as hopeless. One of the first shots fired by the President killed one man and wounded six on board the Belvidere ; and the captain was severe ly wounded in the thigh by the breaking of the breeching of a carronade. On board the President there were three killed and nineteen wounded, the greater part by the bursting of the gun as above related."], [67, "49 NAVAL TEMPLE. ESCAPE OF THE CONSTITUTION. The frigate Constitution, commanded by captain Isaac Hull, had received orders to join the squadron (under commodore Rodgers,) and, for that purpose, sailed from Annapolis on the 5th of .1 uly. On the 17th, off Egg Harbour, four ships, apparently men of war, were discovered from the mast-head to the northward, and in shore of the Constitution; and, in the belief that it was the American squadron, wait ing her arrival, all sail was made in chase of them. At four in the afternoon, another ship was seen to the northeast, standing for the Constitution, with all sail set. At ten in the evening, being then within six or eight miles of the strange sail, the private signal was made by the Constitution ; which not being answered, it was concluded that she, and the ships in shore, were enemy's vessels. Captain Hull immediately laid his vessel in the same course with the others, having determined to lie off till daylight to see what they were. Next morning, two frigates were seen from the Constitution, under her lee, one frigate four or five miles, and a line of battle ship, a frigate, a brig, and a schooner, ten or twelve miles directly astern, all in chase, and coming up fast, they having a fine breeze, and it being nearly calm where the Consti tution was. Finding there was but little chance for escape, being then within five miles of three heavy frigates, the Constitution was cleared for action, and 7"], [68, "50 NAVAL TEMPLE. two guns were run out at the cabin windows and two at the ports on the quarterdeck. At eight o'clock, four of the ships were nearly within gun shot, some of them having six or eight boats ahead, towing with all their oars and sweeps out. In this perilous situation a new expedient was adopted, which was the means of saving the vessel, Being in only twenty-four fathoms water, boats were sent out ahead with anchors, and the ship warped up to them, by which they soon began to get ahead of the enemy. They, however, adopted the same plan, and all the boats from the most dis tant ships were sent to assist those which were nearest. For two days and nights the Constitution was thus chased by the British squadron, sometimes with light winds, at others, warping and towing in a calm, seldom much beyond gun-shot distance. On the morning of the 20th, only three of the squadron could be seen from the mast-head, the nearest about twelve miles distant, directly astern. A light breeze now springing up, the enemy was soon left far behind, and the Constitution, not being able to find the American squadron, arrived safe at Boston. During the whole of the chase the gallant crew of the Constitution remained at their stations. It is related on good authority, that the officers of the British ships expressed their admiration of the skill with which captain Hull man\u0153uvred his ship and effected his escape. But however brilliantly the nautical knowledge and professional adroitness of captain Hull were"], [69, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 51 displayed on that occasion, his generous disinterest edness afterwards, is worthy of universal applause and imitation. The publick notice taken of the affair, and the praises bestowed on the commander, induced him, on his arrival at Boston, to insert the following card on the books of the Exchange Cof fee House. \" Captain Hull, finding that his friends in Boston are correctly informed of his situation, when chased by the British squadron off New York, and that they are good enough to give him more credit for having escaped it than he ought to claim, takes this opportunity of requesting them to transfer their good wishes to lieutenant Morris and the other brave officers, and the crew under his command, for their very great exertions and prompt attention to his orders while the enemy were in chase. Captain Hull has great pleasure in saying, that, notwith standing the length of the chase, and the officers and crew being deprived of sleep, and allowed but little refreshment during the time, not a murmur was heard to escape them.\" . CAPTURE OF THE GUERRIERE. On the second day of August, the Constitution again set sail, pursuing an easterly course. She passed near the coast as far down as the Bay of Fundy; then ran off Halifax and Cape Sable; and"], [70, "52 NAVAL TEMPLE. not seeing any vessels for some days, captain Hull steered toward Newfoundland, passed the Isle of Sables, and took a station off the Gulf of St. Law rence, to intercept the Canada trade. While cruis ing here, he captured two merchant vessels. On the 1 5th, he chased a convoy of five sail, captured one of them, and prevented the prize ship of an American privateer from being retaken. Llaving received information that the British squadron were off the Grand Bank, and not far distant, he changed his cruising ground, and stood to the southward. On the memorable 19th of August, at two p. m. the Constitution being in latitude forty-one degrees and forty-two minutes north, and fifty-five degrees and thirty-three minutes west longitude, a vessel was discovered to the southward. The Constitu tion instantly made all sail in chase, and soon gained on her. At three p. m. it could plainly be perceived she was a ship, on the starboard tack, under easy sail, close hauled to the wind. At half past three, she was ascertained to be a frigate. The Constitu tion continued the chase. At about three miles dis tance, captain Hull ordered the light sails to be taken in, the courses to be hauled up, and the ship to be cleared for action. The chase now backed her main-top-sail, and waited for the Constitution to come down. As soon as the Constitution was ready for action, she bore down, intending to bring imme diately to close action the British frigate, which had about this time hoisted three English ensigns in token of defiance. As soon as the Constitution"], [71, "53 NAVAL TEMPLE, came within gun-shot, the British frigate fired her broadside ; then filled away, wore, and gave a broad side on the other tack. They however, produced no effect ; her shot fell short. The British frigate man\u0153uvred and wore several times for about three quarters of an hour, in order to obtain a raking position. But not succeeding in this, she bore up under her top-sails and jib with the wind on the quarter. Captain Hull immediately made sail to bring his ship up with her. At five minutes before .six, p. m. the Constitution being along side, within pistol-shot, he ordered a brisk firing to be com menced from all her guns, which were double-shot ted with round and grape shot ; and so well directed and so warmly kept up was the American fire, that, in fifteen minutes, the mizzen-mast of the British frigate went by the board, and her main-yard in her slings. Her hull was much injured; and her rig ging and sails torn to pieces. The fire was kept up, in the same spirited manner, for fifteen minutes longer, by the Constitution. She had now taken a position for raking, on the bows of the British fri gate ; when the latter could only bring her bow guns to bear on the Constitution. The grape-shot and small arms of the Constitution completely swept the decks of the British frigate. Thirty minutes after the commencement of the action by the Con stitution, the mainmast and foremast of the British frigate went by the board, taking with them every spar except the bowsprit. She then struck her colours, which had been fastened to the stump of"], [72, "54 NAVAL TEMPLE. the mizzen-mast. The Constitution then set fore and main-sails, and hauled to the eastward to repair damages. All her braces, a great part of her stand ing and running rigging, and some of her spars, were shot away. At seven, p. m. she stood under the lee of the prize, and sent a boat on board, which return ed at eight with captain Dacres, commander of the frigate. She was the Guerriere, rating thirty-eight, and mounting forty-nine guns. The hull of the Guerriere was so much shattered, that a few more broadsides would have sunk her. She had fifteen men killed, sixty-one wounded, and twenty-four missing, who, it is presumed, were swept overboard by the falling masts. The Constitution had only seven killed, and seven wounded. The boats were immediately employed in bring ing the wounded and prisoners on board the Consti tution. About two, a. m. a sail was discovered off the larboard beam, standing to the south. The ship was instantly cleared for action. At three, the vessel stood away. At daybreak, information was received from the lieutenant on board the prize, that the ship was in a sinking condition, and had four feet water in the hold. As soon as all her crew were removed from on board of her, she was set on fire, and blew up a quarter past three. - Captain Hull, in his letter to the secretary of the navy, says :\u2014 \" that, from the smallest boy in the. ship, to the oldest seaman, not a look of fear Avas seen. They all went into action giving three cheers, and requesting to be laid along-side the enemy.\"* * Clark's Naval History, vol. i. p. 175, 176."], [73, "55 NAVAL TEMPLE. In the heat of the engagement, one of the crew of the Constitution, perceiving the flag at the fore top-mast head had been shot away, went up with it, and lashed it so securely, as to render it impossible to shoot it away, unless the mast went with it. The generosity of captain Hull and his crew was equal to their bravery. Captain Dacres, in his official letter, confesses their conduct to have been \"that of a brave enemy; the greatest care being taken to prevent the men losing the slightest article, and the greatest attention being paid to the wounded.\" The Constitution arrived in Boston harbour the 30th day of August. When captain H ull landed, he was received with every demonstration of affec tion and respect. The Washington Artillery, post ed on the wharf, welcomed him with a federal salute, which was returned from the Constitution. An im mense assemblage of citizens made the air ring with loud and unanimous huzzas, which were repeated on his passage up State Street to the Exchange Coffee House. The street was beautifully deco rated with American flags. A splendid entertainment was given to captain Hull and his officers by the citizens of Boston, at which commodore Rodgers and the officers of his squadron were invited. The citizens of Philadel phia subscribed for two elegant pieces of plate \u2014 one to be presented to captain Hull, and the other to Mr. Charles Morris, his first lieutenant. The legislature of New York, the council of the cities"], [74, "56 NAVAL TEMPLE. of Albany and Savannah, the Congress of the Unit ed States, the house of representatives of Massa chusetts, and other publick bodies, voted their thanks to captain Hull, his officers and crew. The order of Cincinnati admitted him as an hon ourary member. Congress voted fifty thousand dollars as an indemnification to the captain, officers, and crew, for the loss sustained by the destruction of the Guerriere. CAPTAIN PORTER.\u2014 FIRST CRUISE OF THE ESSEX. The Essex, commanded by captain David Porter, sailed from New York the third of July, 1812, and shortly after fell in with a fleet of transports, under convoy of a frigate and two bomb-ketches, from Jamaica for Halifax, with troops. The Essex kept at a distance until night, when she cut off a brig with one hundred and fifty soldiers on board, which was ransomed for a bill of exchange on London for fourteen thousand dollars. The men were disarm ed, and an exchange receipt taken for them, and they severally took an oath not to serve until ex changed. The following day captain Porter captured the brig Lamprey from Jamaica, by which he re ceived intelligence that the Thetis frigate, with specie and a large convoy was about sailing for"], [75, "57 NAVAL TEMPLE. England. Every exertion was made to get off St. Augustine in time to fall in with them, but without effect, as fresh gales prevailed from the southwest, which increased till the 19th of July, when, by the violence of the tempest, they were compelled to run before the wind. On the 1 3th of August, the British sloop of war Alert, of twenty guns, ran down on the weather quarter of the Essex. Her crew gave three cheers, and immediately commenced an engagement. But so spirited and well directed a fire was kept up from the Essex, that in eight minutes after the com mencement of the action, she forced the Alert to strike her colours. She had seven feet water in her hold. She was much cut to pieces, and had three men wounded. The Essex did not receive the slightest injury. Captain Porter, being much embarrassed by the number of his prisoners, amounting to about five hundred, concluded an arrangement with the cap tain of the Alert for sending them to a British port, in the Alert, as a cartel. The Alert, on her return to the United States, was fitted out as a government vessel. On the 30th of August, the Essex being in lati tude 36 n. longitude 62 w. a British frigate was discovered standing towards her, under a press of sail. Captain Porter stood for her under easy sail, with his ship prepared for action ; and appre hensive that she might not find the Essex during the night, he hoisted a light. At nine the British ves- 8"], [76, "58 NAVAL TEMPLE. sel made a signal. It consisted of two flashes and a blue light. She was then apparently about four miles distant. Captain Porter stood for the point where she was seen, until midnight, when perceiving nothing of her, he concluded it ewould be best to heave-to for her, until morning, concluding she had done the same. But to his great surprise, and the mortification of his officers and crew, she was no longer in sight. Captain Porter believed it to be not unlikely, that this vessel was the Acasta, of fifty guns, sent out, accompanied by the Ring Dove, of twenty-two, to cruise for the Essex. On the 4th of September, the Essex being off the tail of St. George's Bank, two ships of war were discovered to the southward, and a brig to the northward. The brig was in chase of an American merchant ship. Captain Porter immediately chased the brig, which attempted to pass, and join the rest of the squadron. This he prevented, and compelled her to stand to the northward. He continued in chase of her, until abreast of the American ship, when the wind becoming light, she escaped by means of her sweeps. On shewing American colours, several signal guns were fired by the ships -to the southward. All sail was made bv them in chase. At four p. m. they had gained the wake of the Essex, and were coming up with her very fast. Calculating on making his escape by some man\u0153uvre during the night, he fired a gun to windward. The two ships still continued to gain on the Essex. The largest was considerably to windward of the other, and about"], [77, "59 NAVAL TEMPLE. five miles astern of the Essex. Captain Porter de termined to heave about as soon as it grew dark, and, in case he should not be able to pass her, he determined to fire a broadside into her, and lay her on board. The crew, as soon as the plan was pro posed to them, gave three cheers, and were in high spirits. Twenty minutes after seven, the Essex hove about, and stood s. e. by s. until thirty minutes after eight, wdien she bore away s. w. without see ing any thing more of them. This was the more surprising, as a pistol was fired on board the Essex when nearest to them. The Essex arrived safe in the Delaware a few days after. WASP AND FROLIC. Of all the victories achieved by single vessels, perhaps the most brilliant, and which will probably long stand on record without a parallel, is that of the Wasp, commanded by captain Jacob Jones, over the sloop of war Frolic. On the 1 3th of October, captain Jones left the Delaware bay in the Wasp, on a cruise. On the 16th, she experienced a heavy gale, in which she lost her jib-boom and two men. On the evening of the next day, about eleven o'clock, being in the track of vessels passing from Bermuda to Halifax, she found herself near five strange sail, steering"], [78, "60 NAVAL TEMPLE. eastward. Some of them appearing to be ships of war, it was thought better to get farther from them. The Wasp, therefore, hauled her wind, and having reached a few miles to windward, so as to escape or fight, as occasion might require, followed the strange sail through the night. At daybreak, on Sunday morning, captain Jones found that they were six large merchant ships, under convoy of a sloop of war, from Honduras to England. Four of the ships were large and well manned, mounting from sixteen to eighteen guns, and having from forty to fifty men each. Captain Jones, however, deter mined to attack them. The convoy made their escape under a press of sail. The sloop of war alone remained, which proved to be the Frolic, cap tain Whinyates, mounting twenty-two guns, and having a crew of about one hundred and twenty men. There was a heavy swell in the sea, and the weather was boisterous. The top-gallant yards of the Wasp were taken down, her top-sails were close reefed, and she was prepared for action. About eleven o'clock the Frolic showed Spa nish colours. The Wasp immediately displayed the American ensign and pendant ; and at thirty two minutes past eleven, came down to windward on the larboard side of the Frolic. When within about sixty yards she hailed. The Frolic then hauled down her Spanish colours ; hoisted the British ensign ; and opened a fire of cannon and musketry. This was instantly returned by the Wasp ; and, nearing the enemy, the action became close and"], [79, "61 NAVAL TEMPLE. spirited. About four or five minutes after the com mencement of the action, the main-top-mast of the Wasp was shot away, and, having fallen, with the main-top-sail yard, across the larboard, fore, and fore top-sail braces, rendered her head yards unmanage able during the remainder of the engagement. In two or three minutes more, her gaff and mizzen-top gallant-sail were shot away. She however kept up a close and constant fire. The sea was so rough, that the muzzles of the Wasp's guns were frequent ly under water. The Americans fired as the side of their ship was going down. Their shot, of course, either struck the Frolic's deck, or below it. The English fired as their vessel rose. Their balls con sequently only struck the rigging, or were ineffec tual. The Wasp, having now shot ahead of the Frolic, poured a broadside into her, which com pletely raked her. She then took a position on the Frolic's larboard bow. A most spirited fire was now kept up from the Wasp, which produced great effect. The fire of the Frolic had slackened so much, that captain Jones gave up his intention of boarding her, lest both vessels might be endangered by the roughness of the sea. But, in the course of a few minutes more, not a brace of the Wasp was left. All had been shot away. Her rigging was so much torn to pieces, that captain Jones was afraid, that her masts, being unsupported, would go by the board ; and the Frolic thereby be enabled to escape. He therefore resolved to board, and at once decide the contest. With this intention, he wore ship, and"], [80, "62 NAVAL TEMPLE. ran down upon the enemy. The vessels struck each other. The Wasp's side rubbed along the Frolic's bow. The jib-boom of the latter entered between the main and mizzen rigging of the Wasp, directly over the heads of captain Jones and his first lieuten ant, Biddle, who were then standing together near the capstan. The Frolic now lay in so good a po sition for being raked, that it was resolved not to board until another broadside had been poured into her. So near were the two vessels, that while the men were loading the guns, the rammers of the Wasp were pushed against the Frolic's sides ; and two of her guns went through the bow ports of the Frolic, and swept the whole length of her deck. About this time, Jack Lang, a brave and intrepid seaman, of the Wasp, and who had once been im pressed on board a man of war, jumped on a gun with his cutlass, and was springing on board the Frolic ; when captain Jones, desiring to fire again before boarding, called him down. But, probably urged on by his impetuosity, he did not hear the command of his captain, and was immediately on the bowsprit of the Frolic. Lieutenant Biddle, per ceiving the ardour and enthusiasm of the Wasp's crew, mounted on the hammock-cloth to board. The crew immediately followed. But the lieuten ant's feet being entangled in the rigging of the Frolic's bowsprit, and midshipman Baker, in his ardour to board, laying hold of his coat, he fell back on the Wasp's deck. He directly sprang up, and, as the next swell of the sea brought the Frolic"], [81, "63 NAVAL TEMPLE. nearer, he got on her bowsprit, -where Lang and another seaman were already. He passed them on the forecastle ; and was much surprised at not see ing a single man alive on the Frolic's deck, except the seaman at the wheel, and three officers. The deck was slippery with blood, and strewed with dead bodies. As he went forward, the captain of the Frolick, and two other officers, who were stand ing on the quarter-deck, threw down their swords, and made an inclination of their bodies, as a sign of submission. The colours of the Frolic Avere still flying. None of her seamen, probably, dared to go into the rigging, to strike them, for fear of the mus ketry of the Wasp. Lieutenant Biddle himself immediately jumped into the rigging, and hauled down the British ensign. Possession was taken of the Frolic forty-three minutes after the commence ment of the action. She presented a most shocking spectacle. Her birth-deck was crowded with dead, wounded, and dying. Not above twenty of her crew escaped unhurt. Captain Jones immediately sent his surgeon's mate on board. All the blankets of the Frolic were brought from her slop-room for the accommodation of the wounded. To increase the confusion, both the Frolic's masts fell, soon after taking possession of her, and covered the dead and every thing on deck. In this action, the crews of the vessels were about equal. The British vessel mounted four guns more than the American. The destruction on board of the Frolic could not be exactly determined ; but,"], [82, "64 NAVAL TEMPLE. from the observations of the American officers, and the declarations of the English, there could not have been less than thirty killed, and about fifty wound ed. The Wasp had only five men killed, and five wounded. Lieutenant Biddle was placed on board the Frolic. A suspicious sail being perceived to windward, Captain Jones ordered him to proceed to Charles ton, or any other southern port in the United States. The Wasp intended to continue her cruise. The ships then parted. The suspicious sail bore down very fast. It was at first supposed she was one of the convoy. The Wasp was immediately cleared for action. As she approached, she proved to be a seventy-four, the Poictiers, captain Beresford. She fired a shot over the Frolic ; and, having passed her, overtook the Wasp, the disabled state of whose rigging prevented her from escaping. After she was taken possession of, the Poictiers returned to secure the Frolic. Both vessels were carried into Bermuda. This action completely demonstrated the supe rior skill and spirit of the American naval officers and seamen. The superiority of force certainly was on the side of the British. On the return of captain Jones to the United States, his gallant conduct was not passed unnoticed by his grateful countrymen. The Congress of the United States voted him and his crew twenty-five thousand dollars, in consideration of the loss they sustained by the recapture of the Frolic, also their"], [83, "SAVAL TEMPLE. 65 j thanks. They ordered a gold medal to be pre sented to the captain, and a silver one to each of his officers. This gallant exploit deservedly secured to cap tain Jones and his brave crew, the acknowledgments of their grateful countrymen. The narrow limits of our work, forbid our entering into detail. We shall therefore merely state that pieces of plate, and swords were ordered for captain Jones, and thanks voted to him and his crew, by the legislature of Pennsylvania \u2014 the legislature of the state of Dela ware \u2014 the legislature of New York \u2014 the house of representatives of Massachusetts \u2014 the citizens of Philadelphia, \u2014 the common council of New York, &c. The order of Cincinnati at New York admitted captain Jones into the Society as an honourary member. Captain Jones, in consideration of his merit, was appointed to command the Macedonian, a thirty eight gun frigate, just captured from the British. Lieutenant Biddle was promoted to the rank of master commandant.* SECOND CRUISE OF COMMODORE RODGERS. On the 8th of October, commodore Rodgers sailed again from Boston, in the frigate President, * Clark's Naval History, vol. i. p. 183\u2014186. 9"], [84, "66 NAVAL TEMPLE. accompanied by the L^nited States, Congress, and Aro-us. On the 13th, the United States and Argus parted from the others in a gale of wind. On the 15th, the President and Congress captured the Brit ish packet Swallow, having on board specie amount ing to nearly two hundred thousand dollars. On the 31st they captured a South Sea ship, loaded with oil, one of two ships under convoy of the Galatea frigate, to which they gave chase, but lost her in a fog. During the remainder of the cruise, they saw no other British vessel except the frigate Nymph, which escaped in the night. On the 31st of December they arrived at Boston, having been as far to the east as longitude 22, and to the south as far as latitude 17 north. From longitude 22, they ran down the trade wind to longitude 50, and passed to the north, one hundred and fifty miles from Bermuda. In this cruise, the space passed over was not less than eight thousand miles ; and though the President and Congress returned richly laden, their commanders could not but regret that no opportunity was afforded to try the spirit and discipline of their officers and crews. The cash taken from the Swallow was carried from the navy yard to one of the banks, in several waggons, es corted by the crews of the frigates and a detach ment of marines, with drums beating and colours flying, amidst the huzzas of a large concourse of spectators. The specie and gold dust deposited in the bank were said to be worth nearly three hun dred thousand dollars."], [85, "67 NAVAL TEMPLE. THE ARGUS. After parting from the squadron, as above noted, the Argus, commanded by captain Sinclair, proceeded to the coast of Brazil, sailed along the north coast, from cape St. Roque to Surinam, thence to the windward of the West Indies, and in every direction between the Bermudas, Halifax, and the continent. After a cruise of ninety-six days, she arrived at New York, having made five prizes, valued at two hundred thousand dollars. She fell in with a British squadron of six sail, two of which were of the line, and one of them a remark ably fast sailer. The chase was continued for three days and nights, and under various circum stances, but, by unremitted exertions, the Argus eluded the pursuit. Pressed on all sides by the number of the enemy, and often baffled by the un settled state of the weather, she was at one time within gunshot of a seventy-four, and at another nearly surrounded. While in this perilous situa tion, she actually captured and manned one of her prizes. UNITED STATES AND MACEDONIAN. On the 25th of October, after being separated from the squadron, the United States, commanded by commodore Decatur, fell in with and captured,"], [86, "68 NAVAL TEMPLE. off the Western Isles, after an action of an hour and a half, the British frigate^ Macedonian, captain Carden, mounting forty-nine guns, and carrying three hundred and six men. The Macedonian being to windward, had the advantage of choosing her distance, which was so great, that for the first half hour, the United States could not use her car- ronades ; and at no time, were they within mus- ket or grape shot. To this circumstance, and a heavy swell of the sea, was ascribed the extreme length of the action. In this contest the superiority of the American gunnery was strikingly obvious. The Macedonian had one hundred and six men killed and wounded. She was totally dismasted, and had nearly one hundred shot holes in her hull. On board the United States there were only five killed and seven wounded ; and so little injury was done to the ship, that, in five minutes after the action, she was fully prepared for another. Shortly after the action commenced, such a torrent of fire proceeded from the United States, that the crew of the Macedonian supposed she was actually on fire, and gave three cheers. The Macedonian was a frigate of the largest class, only two years old, four months out of dock, and reputed one of the fastest sailers in the British service. All the private property of the officers and crew of the Macedonian was given up to them; that claimed by captain Carden, amounted to eight hun dred dollars, and was paid for by the commodore,"], [87, "69 NAVAL TEMPLE. An instance of the generosity, which is so pre dominant in the breasts of American tars, must not be omitted. John Archibald, one of the crew of the United States, received a mortal wound, of which he soon after died. He left three children to the mercy of the world and a profligate mother, who had deserted them. When the father of Ar chibald went on board the frigate, to claim the wages and property of his son, an inquiry was made into the circumstances of his family. A plan was immediately agreed upon by the seamen for the relief of the orphans. Two dollars was subscribed by each of them ; a sum of eight hundred dollars was made up, and placed in the hands of suitable trustees, for the maintenance and education of his children. Commodore Decatur arrived at New London with his prize on * the 4th of December. He re ceived from all quarters the congratulations of his countrymen. A gold medal was presented to him by Congress, in testimony of their high sense of his gallantry, good conduct and services. The legis lature of Pennsylvania voted him their thanks, and an elegant sword ; and various other testimonials of publick regard were bestowed upon him and his crew. The news of this brilliant victoiy was received at Washington on the evening of the 8th of Decem ber. It happened, that on that evening, a ball was given in compliment to. the officers and navy gene rally, and particularly to captain Stewart, in ac-"], [88, "70 NAVAL TEMPLE. knowledgement of his politeness to the citizens of Washington on a recent occasion. A large and respectable company was assembled, and the scene was graced by the presence of all the beauty and fashion of the city. The room in which the com- pany were assembled had been decorated with the trophies of naval victory : The colours of the Guerriere and Alert, displayed on the walls, roused the feelings of patriotism, and revived in the mind the recollection of the bravery which had won them. At this time lieutenant Hamilton arrived with the colours of the Macedonian, and despatches from commodore Decatur. He was received with loud acclamations, and escorted to the festive hall ; and the colours of the Macedonian were borne into the room by captains Hull and Stewart, and depo sited with those of the Guerriere and Alert. CONSTITUTION AND JAVA. On the arrival of the Constitution in Boston, after the capture of the Guerriere, captain Hull received permission to remain on shore to attend to his private affairs, and commodore Bainbridge was appointed to command in his room. After undergoing the necessary repairs, she sailed on a cruise along the coast of South Amerira, accompanied by the Hor net sloop of war, commanued by captain LaAvrence. In running doAvn the coast of the Brazils, they"], [89, "71 NAVAL TEMPLE. found the Bonne Citoyenne, a British ship of Avar, loaded with specie lying in the port of St. Salvador. Commodore Bainbridge here separated from cap tain Lawrence, leaving him to blockade the Bonne Citoyenne. On the twenty-ninth of December, the Consti tution, being in 13 degrees south latitude, and 38 west longitude, about ten leagues from the coast of Brazil, at nine a. m. tAvo strange vessels Avere dis covered on her weather bow. At ten they were discovered to be ships. One of them stood in for the land ; the other stood off shore towards the Constitution. At ten commodore Bainbridge tack ed ship to the northward and Avestward, and stood for the sail approaching him. At eleATen a. m. he tacked to the southward and eastward, hauled up the mainsail, and took in the royals. At thirty minutes past eleven, made a private signal for the day, which was not answered ; and then \u00abet mainsail and royals, to draw the strange A'essel off from the neu tral coast, and separate her from her company. At twelve, the American ensign and pendant were hoisted on board the Constitution. At fifteen minutes past twelve, the strange vessel hoisted an English ensign, and displayed a signal at her main mast. At a quarter past one, the ship in sight proving to be an English frigate, and being sufficiently dis tant from land, commodore Bainbridge ordered the mainsails and royals to be taken in, to tack ship and stand for the enemy ; Avho soon bore down Avith an"], [90, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 72 intention of raking the Constitution, which she avoided by wearing. At two o'clock, p. m. the British ship was within half a mile of the Constitu tion, and to windward. She now hauled down her colours, except an union jack at the mizzen-mast head. This induced commodore Bainbridge to order a gun to be fired ahead of her, to make her show her colours. It was succeeded by the Avhole of the Constitution's broadside. On this, the enemy immediately hoisted colours, and returned the fire. A general action now commenced with round and grape shot. The British frigate kept at a much greater distance than the commodore wished. He, however, could not bring her to closer action, with out exposing his vessel to be several times raked. Both vessels for some time man\u0153uvred to obtain a position that would enable them to rake, or avoid being raked. In the early part of the engagement the wheel of the Constitution was shot away. Com modore Bainbridge determined to close with the British vessel, notwithstanding, in so doing, he should expose his ship to be several times raked. He or dered the fore and mainsails to be set, and luffed up close to the enemy, in such a manner that his jib boom got foul of the Constitution's mizzen rigging. About three o'clock, the head of the British vessel's boAvsprit and jib-boom, were shot away ; and, in the space of an hour, her foremast Avas shot away by the board, her main-top-mast just above the cap, her gaff and spanker-boom, and her mainmast nearly by the board."], [91, "NAVAL TEMPLEv 73 About four o'clock, the fire of the British vessel being completely silenced, and her colours in the main rigging being down, she was supposed to have struck. The courses of the Constitution were now hauled on board, to shoot ahead, in order to repair her rigging, which was very much cut. The Brit ish vessel was left a complete wreck. Her flag was soon after discovered to be still flying. The Constitution, hoAvever, hove to, to repair some of her damages. About a quarter of an hour after, the mainmast of the British vessel went by the board. About three quarters of an hour after four, the Constitution wore, and stood for the British ves sel ; and got close to her athwart her bows, in a very effectual position for raking, when she pru dently struck her flag. Had she suffered the broad side to have raked her, her additional loss would have been extremely great ; for she lay quite an unmanageable wreck upon the Avater. After the British frigate struck, the Constitution wore and reefed topsails. One of the only two re maining boats out of eight, was then hoisted out, and lieutenant Parker, of the Constitution, was sent to take possession of the frigate. She proved to be his Britannick majesty's frigate Java, rating thirty eight, but carrying forty-nine guns. She was man ned by upwards of four hundred men ; and was commanded by captain Lambert, a very distinguish ed naval officer. He was mortally wounded. The action continued, from the time the firing com- 10"], [92, "74 NAVAL TEMPLE. menced till the time it ceased, one hour and fifty five minutes. The Constitution had nine men killed, and twen ty-five Avounded. The Java had sixty killed, and one hundred and one (certainly) wounded \u2014 but by a letter written on board the Constitution, by one of the officers of the Java, and accidentally found, it is evident her loss must have been much greater. He states it to have been sixty killed, and one hundred and seventy wounded. The Java had her own full complement of men, and upAvards of one hundred supernumeraries, for British ships in the East Indies. Her force in num ber of men, at the commencement of the action, was probably much greater than the officers of the Constitution were enabled to ascertain. Her offi cers Avere extremely cautious in discovering the number of her crew. By her quarter bill she had one man more, stationed at each gun, than the Con stitution. The Java was an important ship. She was fitted out in the most complete manner, to car ry lieutenant general Hislop and staff to Bombay, of which place he had been appointed .governour, and several naval officers for different vessels in the East Indies. She had despatches for St. Helena, the Cape of Good Hope, and for every British es tablishment in the Indian and Chinese seas. She had copper on board for a seventy-four, and for two brigs, building at Bombay ; and probably a number of other valuable articles."], [93, "75 NAVAL TEMPLE. The great distance from the United States, and the disabled state of the Java, forbade every idea of attempting to bring her to the United States. No alternative was therefore left, but to burn her, which was done, after the prisoners and their baggage were removed to the Constitution. They were all landed at St. Salvador, and paroled. The commander of the Java, captain Lambert, died soon after he was put on shore. The British officers paroled were a lieutenant-general, a major, and a captain, of land service ; in the naval service, a post captain, a mas ter and commander, five lieutenants, three lieuten ants of marines, a surgeon, two assistant surgeons, a purser, fifteen midshipmen, a gunner, a boatswain, a master, a carpenter, and two captain's clerks ; like wise, three hundred and twenty-three petty officers, seamen, and marines \u2014 making all together three hundred and fifty-one men ; besides nine Portuguese seamen, liberated, and eight passengers, private characters, who were permitted to land without restraint. Lieutenant Aylwin, of the Constitution, was se verely Avounded during the action. When the boarders were called to repel boarders, he mounted the quarter-deck hammock cloths, and, in the act of firing his pistol at the enemy, he received a ball through his shoulder. Notwithstanding the severity of his wound, he continued at his post until the enemy struck. A few days afterwards, when an engagement was expected with a ship, which after wards proved to be the Hornet, he left his bed, and"], [94, "76 NAVAL TEMPLE. repaired to quarters, though labouring under a con siderable debility, and under the most excruciating pain. He died on the 28th of January, at sea. Commodore Bainbridge was received by his coun trymen on his return to the United States, with every demonstration of joy and esteem that his gal lant exploit merited. The Congress of the United States voted fifty thousand dollars, and their thanks, to commodore Bainbridge, his officers and crew. They likewise ordered a gold medal to be presented to commodore Bainbridge, and silver ones to each of his officers, ia token of their esteem. The legislatures of Massachusetts and New York, &c. voted their thanks to commodore Bainbridge, his officers, and crew.* HORNET AND PEACOCK. The Hornet, of eighteen guns, commanded by captain LaAvrence, as stated in the preceding article, sailed in company with the Constitution. Such was the eagerness of captain LaAvrence to engage the Bonne Citoyenne, though a much larger Aressel, and having a greater force, both in guns and men, that he sent, through the American consul at St. Salva dor, a challenge to her commander, captain Greene, * Clark's Naval History, vol. i. p. 188 \u2014 192."], [95, "77 NAVAL TEMPLE. pledging his honour, that neither the Constitution, nor any other American vessels should interfere. This pledge was confirmed by commodore Bain bridge, who to show his sincerity, left the Hornet before St. Salvador, and sailed on another cruise. The commander of the Bonne Citoyenne, however did not see fit to accept of the challenge, but suf fered himself to be blockaded by the Hornet. Captain Lawrence continued for fourteen days off the harbour of St. Salvador, blockading the Bonne Citoyenne. Two other English vessels were like wise in the same port, namely, the Fox, of twelve guns, and an armed schooner. On the 24th of January, the Montague of seventy four guns, hove in sight, and drove the Hornet into the harbour \u2014 but night coming on, she wore, and stood out to the southward. Captain Lawrence, knowing that the seventy-four had come for the purpose of relieving the Bonne Citoyenne and packet Fox from blockade, judged it most prudent to change his cruising ground. He therefore hauled by the wind to the westward, with the inten tion of cruising off Pernambuco. On the 10th of February he captured the English brig Resolution, of ten guns, bound to Maranham, from Rio Janeiro, laden with coffee, jerked beef, flour, fustic, butter, and about twenty-five thousand dollars in specie. As this vessel sailed dull, and as captain LaAvrence could not spare hands to man her, he took out the money, and set her on fire."], [96, "78 NAVAL TEMPLE. He then ran down the coast for Maranham ; and cruised there a short time. Thence he ran off Surinam. After cruising off that coast from the fifteenth to the twenty-third of Februry, without meeting with a vessel, he stood for Demarara ; and intended, should he not be fortunate on that station, to run through the West Indies, on his way to the United States \u2014 but, on the 24th, in the morning, he discovered a brig to leeward; to which he imme diately gave chase. Not having a pilot on board, he was obliged to haul off. The fort at the entrance of Demarara river bore soutlnvest, distant about Iavo and a half leagues. Previous to giving up the chase, captain Lawrence discovered a vessel at anchor without the bar, with English colours flying. She appeared to be a brig of war. In beating round Carobana bank, in order to get to her, at half past three p. m. he discovered another sail on his weather quarter, edging doAArn for him. At twenty minutes past four, she hoisted English colours. She was noAv discovered to be a large man of war brig. Captain Lawrence immediately ordered his men to quarters, and had the ship cleared for action. He kept close by the Avind, in order if possible, to get the weathergage of the approaching vessel. At ten minutes past five, finding he could weather the enemy, he hoisted American colours and tacked. About a quarter of an hour after this, the ships pass ed each other, and exchanged broadsides within half pistol shot. Captain LaAvrence observing the enemy in the act of Avearing, bore up, received Us"], [97, "79 .NAVAL TEMPLE. starboard broadside, and ran him close on board on the starboard quarter. From that position he kept up a most severe and well directed fire. So great was its effect, that, in less than fifteen minutes the British vessel struck. She was almost cut to pieces, and hoisted an ensign, union down, from her fore rigging, as a signal of distress. Shortly after, her mainmast went by the board. Lieutenant Shubrick was despatched on board. He soon returned with her first lieutenant, who reported her to be his Britannick Majesty's brig Peacock, commanded by captain William Peake, who fell in the action \u2014 that a number of her crew were killed and wounded \u2014 and that she was sinking very fast, having then six feet water in her hold. The boats of the Hornet Avere immediately des patched for the wounded. Both vessels Avere brought to anchor. Those shot holes in the Pea cock that could be got at, were then plugged, and her guns thrown overboard. Every exertion was used to keep her afloat, until the prisoners could be removed, by pumping and bailing, but Avithout effect. She unfortunately sunk in five and a half fathoms water, with thirteen of her crew, and three of the Hornet's. Lieutenant Connor, midshipman Cooper, and the remainder of the men employed in removing the prisoners, with difficulty saved them selves by jumping into a boat that was lying on the booms, as the vessel went down. Four men of the Peacock's creAv, Avho Avere on board Avhen she Avent down, and were so fortunate as to gain the foretop,"], [98, "80 NAVAL TEMPLE. Avere aftenvards taken off by the Hornet's boats. Previous to the Peacock's sinking, four of her men took to her stern boat, which had been much damaged during the action. There Avas little or no prospect of their reaching the land. They, how ever, arrived safe at Demarara. Captain Lawrence could not ascertain from the officers of the Peacock the exact number of killed. Captain Peake and four men were found dead on board. The master, one midshipman, carpenter, captain's clerk, and twenty-nine seamen of the Pea cock, Avere wounded ; most of them very severely \u2014 three died after being removed \u2014 nine were drowned. The Hornet had only one man killed, and two slightly wounded. Two men were also severely burnt by the explosion of a cartridge, one of Avhom died a few days after. The rigging and sails of the Hornet Avere much cut. A shot passed through the foremast ; the bowsprit Avas slightly injured ; but her hull received very little injury. At the time captain Lawrence brought the Pea cock to action, the Espiegle, the brig mentioned as being at anchor, lay within six miles of the Hornet, between her and the shore, and could plainly see the whole of the action. She mounted eighteen guns. Supposing that she would beat out to the assistance of her consort, great exertions Avere used by the officers and crew of the Hornet, to repair her damages. By nine o'clock her boats were stoAved ; a new set of sails bent ; and the ship completely ready for action."], [99, "81 NAVAL TEMPLE. At two o'clock, a. m. the Hornet got under way, and stood by the wind to the northward and west ward, under easy sail. On mustering next morning, two hundred and seventy souls were found to be on board the Hornet. As the crew of the latter had been for some time on short allowance, captain Lawrence resolved to make the best of his way to the United States. The Peacock was deservedly styled one of the finest vessels of her class in the British navy. She was about the tonnage of the Hornet. Her beam was greater by five inches ; but her extreme length not so great by four feet. She mounted sixteen four and-twenty pound carronades, two long nines, a twelve pound carronade on her top gallant fore castle as a shifting gun, and a four or six pounder, and tAvo swivels aft. By her quarter bill, her crew consisted of one hundred and thirty-four men, four of whom were absent in a prize, besides four men and one boy, who were not on her quarter bill. Of the Hornet's crew, the sailing master and seven men were absent in a prize ; and lieutenant Stewart and six men on the sick list. The conduct of the Hornet's crew toAvards the British seamen, who,*by the sinking of their vessel, had lost every thing except Avhat they had on their backs, manifested much humanity and generosity. They raised among themselves a sufficiency to sup ply these distressed seamen, Avith two shirts, a blue jacket and trowsers each. The surviving officers of the Peacock returned a publick acknowledgment II"], [100, "82 NAVAL TEMPLE. to the captain and officers of the Hornet, for the hu manity and kindness wherewith they treated them. Captain Lawrence on his return to the United States was received with great distinction and ap plause. The same tokens of approbation and esteem Avere conferred on him by\" publick bodies, with Avhich other gallant and successful commanders had been honoured.* XHESAPEAKE AND SHANNON. The Chesapeake frigate, commanded by captaiu Evans, sailed from Boston about the middle of No vember, 1812; and after a cruise of one hundred and fifteen days, returned to Boston. During the cruise several captures of some importance were made. The Chesapeake continued in Boston harbour until the first of June, the day of her unfortunate rencounter with the Shannon. Captain Lawrence, of the Hornet, had a short time previous been ap pointed to command the Chesapeake, and hardly had he arrived at Boston, when the Shannon, com manded by captain Broke, appeared off the harbour with the avowed purpose of seeking a combat with her. \" Stung with the repeated disasters of the British frigates, this officer resolved to make an effort to * Clark's Naval History, vol. i. p. 202 \u2014 205."], [101, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 83 retrieve them ; and when he deemed his ship per fectly prepared for that purpose, sent a formal chal lenge to captain LaAvrence. \" ' As the Chesapeake,' his letter began, ' appears now ready for sea, I request you will do me the favour to meet the Shannon with her, ship to ship, to try the fortune of our respective flags. To an officer of your character, it requires some apology for proceeding to further particulars. Be assured, sir, that it is not from any doubt I entertain of your wishing to close with my proposal, but merely to provide an ansAver to any objection that might be made, and very reasonably, upon the chance of our receiving unfair support.' After observing that commodore Rodgers had not accepted several ver bal challenges which he had given, captain Broke then proceeds to state very minutely the force of the Shannon, and offers to send all British ships out of reach, so that they might have a fair combat, at any place within a certain range along the coast of New England which he specified ; if more agree able, he offers to sail together, and to warn the Chesapeake, by means of private signals, of the approach of British ships of war, till they reach some solitary spot \u2014 or to sail with a flag of truce to any place out of the reach of British aid, so that the flag should be hauled doAvn when it was deemed IS fair to begin hostilities. 1 1 entreat you, sir,' he concludes, ' not to imagine that I am urged by mere personal vanity to the wish of meeting the Chesa peake, or that I depend only upon your personal"], [102, "84 NAVAL TEMPLE. ambition for your acceding to this invitation. We have both nobler motives. You will feel it as a compliment, if I say that the result of our meeting may be the most grateful service I can render to my country ; and I doubt not that you, equally con fident of success, will feel convinced that it is only by repeated triumphs in even combats, that your little navy can noAv hope to console your country for the loss of that trade it can no longer protect.' \" The style of this letter, Avith the exception of the puerile bravado about commodore Rodgers, is frank and manly ; and if the force of the Shannon were correctly stated, Avould be such a challenge as might well be sent from a brave seaman to a gallant adversary. We, however, are but too well satisfied, that captain Broke studiously underrated the num- ber of his guns and crew ; or that, after his chal- lenge, he must have received additions to both. That the Shannon had more guns than the number stated by her commander, we learn from the testi- mony of the surviving officers of the Chesapeake ; who also assert, that she had three hundred and seventy-six men ; that she had an officer and six- teen men from the Belle Poule ; and that the hats of some of her seamen were marked ' Tenedos.' Such as it was, however, this letter, most unfor tunately, never reached captain Lawrence. If he had received it ; if he had been thus warned to pre pare his ship; if he had had an opportunity of selecting his officers, and disciplining his crew ; if, in short, he had been able to place the Chesapeake"], [103, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 85 \u00a9n any thing like equal terms with the Shannon, the combat might have been more bloody \u2014 there might have been such an engagement as has not yet been seen between single ships on the ocean ; though we cannot suffer ourselves to doubt the result of it. But he knew nothing of this chal lenge \u2014 he saw only the Shannon riding before him in defiance ; he remembered the spirit with which he himself overawed a superior, and he could not brook for a moment, that an enemy, which seemed to be his equal, should insult his flag. Although, therefore, the Chesapeake was comparatively an inferiour ship \u2014 although his first lieutenant was sick on shore \u2014 although three of his lieutenants had recently left her; and, of the four who remained, two were only midshipmen, acting as lieutenants \u2014 although part of his crew were new hands, and all of them had lost some of their discipline by staying in port \u2014 yet, as he would have gone to sea in that situation had no enemy appeared, he felt himself bound not to delay sailing on that account, and throwing himself, therefore, on his courage and his fortune, he determined at once to attack the enemy. It was on the morning of the 1st of June, 1813, that the Chesapeake sailed out of the harbour of Boston, to meet the Shannon. As soon as she got under way, captain Lawrence called the crew together, and having hoisted the white flag, Avith the motto of \u2022 free trade and sailor's rights,' made a short address. His speech, however, was received with no enthu siasm \u2014 on the contrary, signs of dissatisfaction Avere"], [104, "86 NAVAL TEMPLE. evident ; particularly from a boatswain's mate, a Portuguese, avIio seemed to be at the head of the malecontents ; and complaints were muttered, that they had not yet received their prize money. Such expressions, at the eve of an action, were but ill bodings of the result of it ; but captain Lawrence, ignorant as he Avas of the characters of his sailors, and unwilling at such a moment to damp their spirits by harshness, preserved his accustomed calmness, and had prize-checks^ at once, given by the purser to those who had not received them. Whilst this scene was passing, the Shannon, observing the Chesapeake coming out, bore away. The Chesa peake followed her till four o'clock in the after noon, Avhen she hauled up and fired a gun, on which the Shannon hove to. They man\u0153uvred for some time, till, at about a quarter before six, they ap proached Avithin pistol shot and exchanged broad sides. \" These broadsides were both bloody ; but the fire of the Shannon Avas most fortunate in the des truction of officers, The fourth lieutenant, Mr. Ballard, was mortally wounded \u2014 the sailing master was killed, and captain Lawrence received a mus ket ball in his leg, Avhich caused great pain, and profuse bleeding, but he leaned on the companion way, and contiued to order and to animate his crew. A second, and a third broadside was exchanged, with evident \"advantage on the part of the Chesa peake ; but, unfortunately, among those now wound ed on board of her Avas the first lieutenant, Mr."], [105, "87 NAVAL TEMPLE. Ludlow, who was carried below \u2014 three men Avere successively shot from the helm, in about twelve mi nutes from the commencement of the action ; and,. as the hands were shifting, a shot disabled her fore sail, so that she would no longer answer her helm, and her anchor caught in one of the after ports of the Shannon, which enabled the latter to rake her upper deck. As soon as captain Lawrence perceived that she was falling to leeward, and that by the Shan non's filling she would fall on board, he called his boarders, and was giving orders about the foresail, when he received a musket ball in his body. The bugleman, who should have called the boarders, did not do his duty ; and, at this moment, commodore Broke, whose ship had suffered so much that he i was preparing to repel boarding ; perceiving, from this accident, how the deck of the Chesapeake was swept, jumped on board Avith about tAventy men. They would have been instantly repelled ; but the captain, the first lieutenant, the sailing-master, the boatswain, the lieutenant of marines, the only act ing lieutenant on the spar-deck, were all killed or disabled. At the call of the boarders, lieutenant Cox ran on deck, but just in time to receive his falling commander, and bear him below. Lieuten ant Budd, the second lieutenant, led up the board ers, but only fifteen or twenty would follow him, and Avith these he defended the ship till he Avas wounded and disabled. Lieutenant Ludlow, wound ed, as he was, hurried upon deck, Avhere he soon received a mortal cut from a sabre. The marines"], [106, "88 NAVAL TEMPLE. who Avere engaged fought with desperate courage ; but they were few in number ; too many of them having followed the Portuguese boatswain's mate, who exclaimed, it is said, as he skulked beloAV, ' so much for not paying men their prize-money.' Meanwhile the Shannon threw on board sixty addi tional men, who soon succeeded in overpowering the seamen of the Chesapeake, Avho had now no officers to lead or rally them, and took possession of the ship ; which Avas not, however, surrendered by any signal of submission, but became the enemy's only because they were able to overwhelm all Avho were in a condition to resist. \" As captain LaAvrence was carried below, he perceived the melancholy condition of the Chesa peake, but cried out, ' Don't surrender the ship.' He was taken down into the ward-room, and, as he lay in excruciating pain, perceiving that the noise above had ceased, he ordered the surgeon to go on deck, and tell the officers to fight on to the last, and never strike the colours. ' They shall Avave,' said he, ' while I live.' But it was too late to resist or to struggle longer ; the enemy had already pos session of the ship. As captain Lawrence's wounds Avould not allow of his removal, he continued in the ward-room, surrounded by his wounded officers, and, after lingering in great pain for four days, during which his sufferings were too acute to permit him to speak, or, perhaps, to think of the sad events he had just witnessed, or do more than ask for what his situation required, he died on the 5th of"], [107, "89 NAVAL TEMPLE. June. His body was wrapped in the colours of the Chesapeake, and laid on the quarter deck, until they arrived at Halifax, Avhere he Avas buried with the highest military and naval honours ; the British officers forgetting in their admiration of his charac ter, that he had been but lately their enemy. His pall was supported by the oldest captains in the navy then at Halifax, and no demonstration of res pectful attention was omitted to honour the remains of a brave, but unfortunate stranger. \" In this sanguinary engagement the Chesapeake lost her commander and forty-seven men killed, and ninety-seven wounded, of whom fourteen afterwards died. Among these were lieutenant Ludlow, first lieutenant of the ship, and lieutenant Ballard, the fourth lieutenant, both excellent officers. \" On the part of the Shannon captain Broke Avas dangerously wounded, though he has since recover ed ; the first lieutenant, the purser, captain's clerk, and twenty-three seamen killed, and fifty-seven persons wounded, besides captain Broke. \"The capture of the Chesapeake is to be as cribed wholly to the extraordinary loss of officers (a loss without any precedent, as far as we can recol lect, in naval history;) and to her falling acci dentally on board the \"Shannon. During the three broadsides, while the officers of the Chesapeake were living, and she was kept clear of the enemy, the superiority Avas manifestly with the Americans. The Chesapeake had received scarcely any damage, Avhile the Shannon had several shot between Avind 12"], [108, "90 NAVAL TEMPLE. and water, and could with difficulty be kept afloat during the succeeding night. It was only Avhen ac cident threw the Chesapeake on board the Shannon, Avhen her officers were unable to lead on the hoarders, that captain Broke himself, contrary, we believe, to the regulations of the British navy, left his oAvn ship, and Avas able, by superior numbers, to overpower the distracted crew of the Chesapeake. \" We have heard many accounts, Avhich we are very reluctantly compelled to believe, of improper conduct by the British after the capture, and of brutal violence offered to the crew of the Chesa peake. As, however, some allowances are due to the exasperated passions of the moment, something too to the confusion of a bloody and doubtful struggle, we are unwilling to prolong the remem brance of imputations which may be disproved, and perhaps have been exaggerated. \" But we should wrong the memory of captain Lawrence, we should be unjust to the officers of the American navy, with whose glory all the aspiring ambition of the country is so closely blended, if we omitted any opportunity of giving the last and fair est lustre to their fame, by contrasting their conduct with that of the enemy, or if we forbore, from any misplaced delicacy towards our adversaries, to re port circumstances connected with the fate of the Chesapeake, which throw a broad and dazzling light on the generous magnanimity of our countrymen.\" Our readers cannot have failed to observe the liberality Avhich was extended to the officers and"], [109, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 91 creAvs of the Guerriere, Macedonian, and Java, and the still more striking instance of the Peacock. \" When the Chesapeake was taken by the Shannon, the key of captain Lawrence's store-room was de manded of the purser. It was given; but the purser observed at the same time, that in the cap tures of the Guerriere, Macedonian, and Java, the most scrupulous regard was paid to the private pro perty of the British officers ; that captain Lawrence had laid in stores for a long cruise ; and that the value of them would be a great object to his widow and family, for Avhose use he was desirous, if possi ble, of preserving them. This request Avas not merely declined ; it was haughtily and superci liously refused. \" However Ave may mourn the sufferings of that day, the loss of the Chesapeake has not, in our esti mation, varied the relative standing of the marine of the two countries ; nor does it abate, in the slightest degree, any of the loftiness of our naval pretensions. The contest was wholly unequal in ships, in guns, in crews, in officers, in every thing. \" The Shannon was a better ship ; she had not upon her the curse of that ill-omened name, the Chesapeake. The Shannon was a stronger ship ; she mounted twTenty-eight eighteen pounders on the main deck, twenty-two thirty-two pound car ronades, and tAvo long brass nines or twelves, on the spar deck, and a large carronade amidships, in all fif ty-two guns, besides this last heavy carronade ; while the Chesapeake mounted tAventy-eight eighteen"], [110, "92 NAVAL TEMPLE. pounders on the main deck, and twenty thirty two pound carronades, and one eighteen pounder, chase gun, on the spar deck, in all forty-nine guns. ' \" The Shannon had a better creAV. Besides her complement she had seamen from two other ships. That crew, too, had been long at sea ; long in the ship ; Avere known ; AA^ere tried ; and as commodore Broke sent a challenge, were, of course, men on Avhom, if they were not picked for the occasion, he knew he could confide. The Chesapeake had, on the contrary, in part, a new crew, unknown to their officers, not yet knoAving their places or the ship. The ship had not been more than a feAV hours at sea, and the landsmen and the lands women had been dismissed from her on the very day of the engage ment. The officers, too, although Ave should be the last to detract from their merits, and although the manner in Avhich they fought their ship does them the highest honour, the officers were young and few in number, and had as yet hardly any op portunity of disciplining or knowing their seamen ; yet, under all these disadvantages, the great damage sustained by the Shannon, and the great loss of her crew, all which took place before the boarding, warrant completely the opinion, that, but for the accidental loss of officers, the victory would have been Avith the Chesapeake.\"* Mr. Crowninshield, of Salem, obtained a flag of truce for the purpose of conveying to the United States the bodies of Lawrence and LudloAv, which * Port Folio."], [111, "93 NAVAL TEMPLE. he performed. On his return to Salem, the bodies of the departed heroes were conveyed, Avith the most affecting ceremonies, from the cartel to the shore. From the time the boats left the brig, until the bodies were landed, minute guns were fired from the vessels in the harbour. When placed upon the hearses, they Avere covered with the colours, which they had so lately and so signally honoured, and moved to a convenient distance for the procession to form, which moved to solemn musick, to the meetinghouse. The corpses Avere then placed in the centre of the church, by the seamen who rowed them to the shore, and Avho stood, during the whole of the service, leaning upon them in an attitude of mourning. The church was hung with cypress and evergreen. The names of Lawrence and Ludlow appeared in letters of gold, encircled by festoons of evergreen, immedi ately in front of the desk. An eulogy was pro nounced by the honourable judge Story. After the performances in the meetinghouse, the seamen conveyed the remains to the tomb, Avhere the ma sonick societies and military corps, paid the last ritual homage to the illustrious dead.

COM. DECATUR BLOCKADED IN NEW LONDON. In the early part of the summer, (1813,) commo- dore Decatur, in the frigate United States, accom- panied by the Macedonian, captain Jones, and the sloop of Avar Hornet, put to sea from New York. But a very superior force, consisting of line of battle ships and frigates, hove in sight and gave chase immediately after he left port. The Ameri- can squadron was fortunate enough to reach the harbour of New London, where, for the remainder of the summer, they were blockaded, without any thing interesting occurring except an attempt made to blow up some of the English vessels by a fireship. The fireship was called the Eagle, and fitted out for the purpose by John Scudder. It was supposed that on her being captured, she would be taken along side one of the vessels of war, when, in at- tempting to unlade her, a considerable quantity of poAvder and other combustibles would have been set on fire. The attempt Avas made in the month of June. She was taken possession of by the British ; but bleAv up before she got alongside any of their large vessels. At the time of explosion, four boats were seen alongside, Avhich were all, Avith the men on board them, destroyed. It is supposed that upAvards of one hundred of the British perished."], [113, "95 NAVAL TEMPLE. CAPTURE OF THE EAGLE. In the month of July, a fishing smack was sent by commodore Lewis, of New York, for the pur pose of capturing by stratagem the sloop Eagle, a tender of the Poictiers, a British vessel of seventy four guns. The smack was borroAved of some fishermen. A calf, a sheep, and goose, were put on board. Between thirty and forty men well armed with muskets were secreted in the cabin, and fore peak of the smack. Thus prepared she stood out to sea as if going on a fishing voyage to the banks. Only three men appeared on deck, dressed as fishermen. The Eagle, on perceiving the smack, gave chase. After coming along side, and discovering live stock on board, she ordered the smack down to the commodore, then about five miles off. The helmsman of the smack answered, \" Aye, aye, sir ;\" and apparently put up the helm for that purpose, which brought the smack along side the Eagle, not more than three yards distant. The watch word Lawrence, was then given, and the armed men rushed on deck from below; and poured a volley of musketry into the tender ; which drove her crew beloAv with so much precipi tancy, that they had not time to strike her colours. As soon as sailing master Percival, who commanded the smack, perceived the deck of the British vessel cleared, he ordered his men to cease firing. Upon"], [114, "96 NAVAL TEMPLE. which one of the Eagle's crew appeared on deck, and struck her colours. The Eagle was safely taken into New York.* THIRD CRUISE OF THE PRESIDENT. On the 23d of April, 1813, commodore Rodgers put to sea from Boston, in the President frigate, accompanied by the Congress, commanded by cap tain Smith. On the 30th he took his departure from President road. On the 3d of May, while in chase of a British brig of war, near the shoal of George's Bank, they passed to windAvard of three sail, one of Avhich Avas supposed to be the La Hogue, seventy-four ; the others, the Nymph frigate and a merchant brig. After getting clear of George's Bank, they continued along southeastwardly, in the direction of the southern edge of the Gulf stream, till the 8th of May, Avhen the President parted from the Congress. Commodore Rodgers then shaped his course, as near as the wind would permit, to intercept the eneniy's West India commerce, pass ing to the southward of the Grand Bank. Not meeting with any thing in this direction, except American vessels from Lisbon and Cadiz, he changed his course to the norttiAvard. Having reached the forty-eighth degree of north latitude, * Clark's Naval History, vol. i. p. 209."], [115, "97 NAVAL TEMPLE. he steered for the Azores, off which he continued in different directions till the 6th of June, without meeting any British vessels. Being informed by an American vessel, that four days previous she had passed a British convoy from the West Indies, the commodore crowded all sail in chase to northeast. Though disappointed in falling in with the convoy, he nevertheless captured four vessels. Being then in latitude forty-six north, longitude twenty-eight west, he determined to proceed to the North Sea. He however did not meet with a single vessel until off the Shetland Islands, and those he there met with were Danish, under British license. His water and provisions being now nearly exhausted, he put into North Bergen, in Norway, on the 27th of June. A scarcity in the country prevented his obtaining provisions. After having filled his casks with Avater, he departed on the 2d of July, towards the Orkney Islands, and thence to ward the North Cape, for the purpose of intercept ing a convoy of twenty-five or thirty sail, which, it was said, would leave Archangel about the middle of July, under the protection of two sloops of Avar. This was confirmed by two vessels he captured on the 18th of the same month. In this, however, the commodore was disappointed by a seventy-four and frigate making their appearance off North Cape on the 19th of July, just as he Avas in momentary ex pectation of meeting the convoy. On first dis covering these two vessels, OAving to the haziness of the AA'eather, he could not ascertain their character 1 3"], [116, "98 NAVAL TEMPLE. with precision. He accordingly stood towards them until he discovered their strength, when he hauled by the wind on the opposite tack to avoid them. But OAving to faint variable winds, and light for an entire day, for in that latitude and season the sun appeared above the horizon at midnight, the British vessels were enabled to continue the chase upwards of eighty hours. At times, owing to changes of the Avind in favour of the British vessels, they Avere brought near to the President. When these vessels gave chase to the President, the priva teer Scourge of NeAv York was in company, but so intent were the British in their chase of the former, that the latter escaped. Having but a very small quantity of provision* on board his vessel, commodore Rodgers deter mined to proceed to a more westerly station after having escaped from the superior British force that so long chased him. He accordingly steered to intercept the trade passing out of and into the Irish channel, Avhere on the 25th of Julv and 2d of August he made three captures ; but receiving information that the British had a superior force in the vicinity, he deemed it expedient to change his cruising ground. After having made a circuit round Ire land, and having come into the latitude of Cape Clear, he steered for the Banks of Newfoundland, near to which he captured two more vessels : from one of these he obtained information that the Belle rophon, a seventy -four, and the Hyperion frigate, Avere on the eastern part of the bank, only a few"], [117, "99 NAVAL TEMPLE. miles to the westward of him. He however did not fall in with them. From this place the commodore directed his cruise to the United States, without seeing a single vessel until the 22d of September, when, being near the south shoal of Nantucket, he met with a Swedish brig, and American cartel. By this time the provisions, and particularly the bread on board the President, were so nearly expended, that it became indispensably necessary for the com modore to put into the first convenient port, after obtaining information of the position of the British cruisers. This he obtained by the capture of his Britannick Majesty's schooner High Flyer, on the 23d, Avith Avhich vessel he arrived safe at Newport. During this cruise commodore Rodgers captured twelve vessels, of which the crews amounted to two hundred and seventy-one persons. He rendered very effectual service to his country by harassing the British commerce, and forcing them to detach a great number of their vessels of war in an unsuc cessful pursuit.* It is a circumstance, someAvhat singular, that, since the rencounter with the Belvidere, commodore Rodgers has never met Avith an English frigate that was not in company with a seventy-four ; notwith standing he cruised in the European seas, and coasted the shores of Britain and Ireland. He twice traversed over more than half the globe, with out ever meeting a British frigate ; and though he * Clark's Naval History, vol. i. p. 213. 2.14."], [118, "100 NAVAL TEMPLE. sought them in their own seas, and along their own shores, he never had the good fortune to bring one of them to action. Yet, with all this, commodore Rodgers has suffered no dimunition of reputation. It is creditable to the American character, to cherish and uphold the high reputation of a merito rious officer, notwithstanding opportunities have not been given him to display his skill and prowess against an equal force of the enemy. CRUISE OF THE CONGRESS. The Congress, after parting with the President, on the 8th of May, proceeded, in a circuitous di rection, to the southeast, crossing the equator, pass ing the northeast coast of Brazil, and thence home ward. During his cruise, captain Smith made prizes of three valuable vessels of the enemy, two of which were destroyed, after taking out the most Valuable part of their cargoes ; and the other given up to the prisoners, who were paroled. He arrived in Portsmouth harbour on the 14th of December."], [119, "101 NAVAL TEMPLE. ARGUS AND PELICAN. Captain Allen, in the brig Argus, sailed from the United States for France, having on board Mr. CraAvford, minister to the court of Paris, in May, 1813. He arrived there in the short passage of twenty-three days, during which he captured and destroyed a British schooner of six guns. After remaining at L'Orient a few days, he pro ceeded on a cruise in the British channel, where he captured twenty English vessels ; the crews of Avhich he treated with humanity and generosity. The injury which captain Allen did to the British commerce is, in some of their papers, estimated to the amount of two millions. While employed in burning, sinking and destroying the enemy's pro perty, he was peculiarly careful to distinguish his character from those who depredated for selfish purposes only. The property of the passengers was sacred from hostility ; not an article of that kind would he suffer to be touched. The passen gers were allowed to go below, and to take Avhat they claimed as their own, and no hands belonging to the Argus were permitted to inspect them while they were employed in so doing. On one occasion, Avhen a passenger had left his surtout behind him, it was sent after him in the boat: on another occasion, captain Allen ordered \u00a9ne of his hands, who was detected in the act of"], [120, "102 NAVAL temple. some petty plunder of this kind, to be flogged at the gangway. The English papers, while they were Avrithing under the severe injuries thus in flicted, were unanimous in their testimonials of respect to the conduct of this gallant officer, for the humanity and delicacy Avith which he performed a service so invidious. Probably no action of his life could more plainly distinguish his character than this : he loved danger as much as he abhorred to plunder the defenceless. On the 14th of August, being in latitude fifty two degrees fifteen minutes north, longitude five degrees fifty minutes west, he discovered, at four o'clock, a. m. a large brig of war, standing doAvn under a press of sail upon the Aveather quarter of the Argus. Captain Allen immediately prepared to receive her ; and being unable to get the weather gage, he shortened sail, and gave her an opportunity of closing. At six o'clock, the brig having display ed English colours, the Argus hoisted the Ameri can flag, Avore round, and gave her the larboard broadside, being at this time within grape distance, which was returned, and the action commenced within the range of musketry. A few minutes past six, captain Allen was wounded ; and, being much exhausted by the loss of blood, Avas taken below. At this time, the Argus had lost her main braces, main springstay, gaff, and try-sail mast, and shortly after her- sprit-sail-yard, and the principal part of the rigging on the larboard side of the foremast."], [121, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 103 Lieutenant Watson, upon whom the command of the vessel devolved, after captain Allen was carried below, received a wound on the head from a grape shot, which, for a time, rendered him incapable of attending to duty, and he was also carried below. The command now devolved upon lieutenant Allen ; the enemy, being on the weather quarter of the Ar gus, edged off, for the purpose of getting under her stern, but the Argus frustrated his attempt by giving him a broadside. About half past six, the Argus, having lost the use of her after-sails, fell before the wind, when the enemy succeeded in passing her stern, and ranged upon the starboard side. The wheel-ropes, and rigging of every des cription being shot away, the Argus became un manageable ; and the enemy, not having sustained any apparent damage, had it completely in his power to choose a position. By this advantage he, profited, and continued to play upon her starboard quarter, occasionally shifting his situation, when lieutenant Watson returned to the deck, and pre pared to board the enemy ; but, in consequence of the shattered condition of the Argus, was unable to effect it. After this, the British continued a raking fire, which could be but faintly opposed, the guns of the Argus being much disabled, and seldom brought to bear. Having suffered in the hull and rigging, and also in killed and Avounded, and being exposed to a galling fire, Avhich, from the enemy's ability to manage, could not be avoided, lieutenant Watson deemed it necessary to surrender. The"], [122, "104 NAVAL TEMPLE. Argus was then taken possession of by the British sloop of war Pelican, of tAventy-one carriage guns, viz. sixteen thirty-two pound carronades, four long sixes, aud one twelve pound carronade, commanded by captain Maples. The Argus carried eighteen twenty-four pounders, and iavo long twelves. The loss on board the Pelican, as stated in the British official account, was eight in killed and wounded. The loss in the Argus. Avas six killed and twelve wounded. Five of the wounded died soon after, among Avhom Avas captain Allen, who lost his leg at the second broadside, and died the next day. It would be unjust to the feelings which are revived by the preceding account, and ungrateful to the memory of a brave and distinguished officer, to record in our pages only the circumstances which cost him his life, and his countrymen so much poignant regret. The prominent traits of his cha racter, and the honours paid to his remains, in a foreign land, and by those who were his adversaries in war, should be co-extensive Avith every register of naval achievements. The following letter from John HaAvker, Esq. ci-devant American consul, will be read with interest. Plymouth, August 19, 1813. Sir. \u2014 The station I have had the honour to hold for many years past, of American vice-consul, calls forth my poignant feelings in the communication I"], [123, "105 NAA'AL TEMPLE. have to make to you of the death of your son, cap tain Allen, late commander of the United States brig of Avar Argus, Avhich vessel was captured on Saturday last, in the Irish channel, after a very sharp action of three quarters of an hour, by his Britannick majesty's ship Pelican. Early in the action he lost his left leg, but re fused to be carried below, till from loss of blood he fainted. Messrs. Edwards and Delphy, midship men, and four seamen were killed ; and lieutenant Watson, the carpenter, boatswain, boatsAvain's mate, and seven men wounded. Captain Allen submitted to amputation above the knee, while at sea. He was yesterday morning attended by very eminent surgical gentlemen, and removed from the Argus to the hospital, where every possible attention and assistance would have been afforded him had he survived ; but which was not, from the first moment, expected, from the shattered state of his thigh. At eleven, last night, he breathed his last! He was sensible, at intervals, until within ten minutes of his dissolution, when he sunk exhausted, and expired without a struggle ! His lucid intervals were very cheerful, and he was satisfied and fully sensible that no advice or assistance would be wanting. A de tached room was prepared by the commissary and chief surgeon, and female attendants engaged, that every tenderness and respect might be experienced. The master, purser, surgeon, and one midshipman, accompanied captain Allen, who was also attended bv his two servants. 14"], [124, "106 NAVAL TEMPLE.

Thus lived and thus died William Henry Allen. By the company and conversation of the elegant and polite, the hard and severe duties of the sailor acquired a sort of polish, and his character present ed that combination of gallantly, grace and intre pidity, that so irresistibly attracts. In the hour of danger, he was calm, intrepid and persevering; in private intercourse, guarded, affable and delicate. Entering into the navy with large and expanded ideas of honour, the perils he encountered, and the hard services he endured, consolidated his romantick and floating visions into rules and principles of action. By never lowering his lofty standard amidst the justle of contending difficulties, he at length arrived at it ; and new trials served only to call into exercise new and unexplored resources of fortitude. He had so long forsaken every other consideration for glory, that he finally measured his life by this standard, and felt a repulsive antipathy to whatever fell short of that measure. There has seemed a sort of compact among our naval commanders, never to quit their station on"], [127, "109 NAVAL TEMPLE. deck. Allen, in his mutilated state, refused to be carried beloAv, and fainted on the deck from loss of blood. Lawrence showed the same determined spirit, and never left his station until he was too far exhausted by his wounds to animate his men by his example. Burrows, although mortally wounded at his quarters, still remained at his post, survived the action, and there received the sword of his gallant and intrepid antagonist. The following extract from captain Allen's letter, addressed to his sister, will show the character of this intrepid officer in an amiable light : \"When you shall hear that I have ended my earthly career, that I only exist in the kind remem brance of my friends, you will forget my follies, forgive my faults, call to mind some little instances dear to reflection, to excuse your love for me, and shed one tear to the memory of HENRY.\" ENTERPRIZE AND BOXER. On the 1st of September, the United States brig Enterprize, commanded by lieutenant William Bur rows, sailed from Portsmouth on a cruise. On the morning of the 3d, Burrows discovered a schooner, which was chased into Portland harbour, Avhere the Enterprize was brought to anchor. Having re ceived information of several privateers being off"], [128, "110 NAVAL TEMPLE. Manhagan, he weighed anchor and swept out the folloAvino- morning, and stood for that place. Next day a large brig of war Avas discovered, to which chase was immediately given. The enemy fired several guns, and stood for the Enterprize, with four ensigns hoisted. After man\u0153uvring and reconnoi tering for some time for the purpose of discovering the force of the enemy, lieutenant BurroAvs, about three in the afternoon, shortened sail, tacked, and run down, with the intention of bringing her to close action. At twenty minutes after three the firing commenced from both vessels, within half pistol shot. The action continued for about a quarter of an hour, when the Enterprize ranged ahead of the enemy, rounded to, and raked her. Shortly after the main-top-mast and top-sail-yard of the enemy came down. The foresail of the Enterprize was then set, and she took a position on the starboard bow of the enemy, and continued to rake her, until, about forty minutes after the commencement of the action, the enemy ceased firing, and cried for quar ters : their colours being nailed to the masts, could not be hauled down. The prize proved to be the British brig Boxer, of fourteen guns. The number of her crew could not be ascertained, but sixty-four prisoners were taken, including seventeen wounded. On board the Enterprize there was only one killed and thirteen wounded, two of whom died of their wounds. Lieutenant Burrows fell in the commencement of the action ; he, hoAvever, refused to be carried be-"], [129, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 111 low, but, raising his head, requested that the flag might never be struck. When the sword of the vanquished enemy Avas presented to the dying con queror, he clasped his hands and said, \" I am satis fied ; I die contented ;\" and then, and not till then, would he consent to be carried below, where every attention was paid to save his life, but in vain. A feAv hours after the victory he breathed his last. \u2014 Captain Blythe, the commander of the Boxer, also fell in the commencement of the action, having received a cannon 6hot through the body. His remains, in company with those of lieutenant Bur rows, were brought to Portland, where the two commanders were interred, side by side, with mili tary honours. The Boxer was so much damaged in her sails* rigging, spars, hull, &c. as to render it difficult to carry her into port. The Enterprize received but trifling injury. On an examination of the prize, she was adjudged wholly to the captors, agreeably to law, as a vessel of superior force. Soon after the arrival of the Enterprize and her prize at Portland, the bodies of the two command ing officers, lieutenant Burrows and captain Blythe, were brought on shore in ten oared barges, roAved at minute strokes by masters of ships, accompanied by most of the barges and boats in the harbour, while minute guns were fired from the twro vessels. A grand procession was then formed, the corpse of lieutenant Burrows preceding, and the interment took place Avith all the honours that the civil and"], [130, "112 NAVAL TEMPLE. military authorities at the place, and the great body of the people, could bestow. During the proces sion forts Preble and Scammel, (names dear to their country,) fired minute guns. It is worthy of record that the crew of the Boxer were permitted to march in the late procession at Portland, when their late captain was interred. Such was not the case with the crew of the Chesa peake. The following documents we think will be read with more satisfaction than any thing we could write on the same subject; especially the letter from lieutenant M'Call, the officer on whom the command of the Enterprize devolved after lieuten ant Burrows was rendered incapable of directing the action. Copy of a letter from captain Hull to the Secretary of the Navy. Portland, September 7, 1813. Sir, \u2014 I had the honour last evening to forward you by express, through the hands of commodore Bainbridge, a letter received from Samuel Storer, Esq. navy agent at this place, detailing an account of the capture of the British brig Boxer by the United States brig Enterprize. I now have to inform you that I left Portsmouth this morning, and have this moment arrived, and, as the mail is closing, I have only time to enclose you the report of lieutenant M'Call, of the Enterprize, and to assure you that a statement of the situation of the two vessels as to the damage they have re-"], [131, "113 NAVAL TEMPLE. ceived, &c. shall be forwarded as soon as surveys can be made. The Boxer has received much damage in her hull, masts and sails, indeed it was with difficulty she could be kept afloat to get her in. The Enterprize is only injured in her masts and sails. I have the honour to be, &c. ISAAC HULL. The Hon. Wm. Jones, Secretary of the Navy. United States brig Enterprize, Portland, September 7, 1813. Sir, \u2014 In consequence of the unfortunate death of lieutenant-commandant William Burrows, late commander of this vessel, it devolves on me to acquaint you with the result of the cruise. After sailing from Portsmouth on the 1st instant, we steered to the eastward ; and on the morning of the 3d, off Wood Island, discovered a schooner, which we chased into this harbour, where we anchored. On the morning of the 4th, weighed anchor and swept out, and continued our course to the east- Avard. Having received information of several pri vateers being off Manhagan, we stood for that place ; and on the folloAving morning, in the bay near Pen guin Point, discovered a brig getting under way, which appeared to be a vessel of Avar, and to Avhich Ave immediately gave chase. She fired several guns and stood for us, having four ensigns hoisted. After reconnoitering and discovering her force, and the nation to which she belonged, we hauled upon a wind to stand out of the bay, and at three o'clock shortened sail, tacked to run doAvn with an intention 15"], [132, "H4 NAVAL TEMPLE. to bring her to close action. At twenty minutes after three, p. m. when Avithin half pistol shot, the firing commenced from both, and after being warmly kept up, and with some man\u0153uvring, the enemy hailed and said they had surrendered, about four, p. m. \u2014 their colours being nailed to the masts, could not be hauled down. She proved to be his Britan nick majesty's brig Boxer, of fourteen guns, Sam uel Blythe, Esq. commander, who fell in the early part of the engagement, having received a cannon shot through the body. And I am sorry to add that lieutenant Buitoavs, who had gallantly led us into action, fell also about the same time by a musket ball, Avhich terminated his existence in eight hours. The Enterprize suffered much in spars and rig ging, and the Boxer in spars, rigging and hull, hav ing many shots betAveen wind and water. It would be doing injustice to the merit of Mr. Tillinghast, second lieutenant, were I not to men tion the able assistance I received from him during the remainder of the engagement, by his strict at tention to his own division and other departments. And of the officers and crew generally, I am happy to add, their cool and determined conduct have my warmest approbation and applause. As no muster roll that can be fully relied on has come into my possession, I cannot exactly state the number killed and Avounded on board the Boxer, but from information received from the officers of that vessel, it appears there were between twenty and twenty-five killed and fourteen Avounded.

A Card. \u2014 Captain Hull, with the officers and crew of the United States brig Enterprize, are deeply impressed with the readiness and alacrity Avith which the inhabitants of Portland, in their civil and military departments, assembled to do honour to the memory of the brave lieutenant William Burrows, late commander of the Enterprize, Avho fell in the gallant action with his Britannick majesty's brig Boxer, which she captured and brought into this port ; and beg they will receive their grateful acknowledgments for their very handsome tribute of respect exhibited in their attendance on the funeral of that brave officer, as well as that of his gallant competitor, captain Samuel Blythe, late commander of the Boxer, who fell in the same ac tion, and to whom equal honours were paid in every respect, in their funeral obsequies, exhibit ing to the Avorld an evidence of that character Avhich the Americans are proud to possess, of show ing every tribute of respect to a brave enemy who has fallen in combat, and of extending to those in their power every mark of liberality and comfort consistent with their situation as prisoners. Captain Hull, Avith the officers and creAV of the Enterprize, embrace the present occasion to express"], [134, "116 NAVAL TEMPLE. the sense which they entertain of the prompt at tention and of the active and humane exertions of Samuel Storer, Esq. the United States navy agent at Portland, in having every accommodation pro vided for the Avounded on board the United States brig Enterprize as well as those on board the Boxer, between Avhom no distinction was made. And they likewise beg the physicians of Portland who have been so kind as to afford the most prompt and ample exercise of their professions towards the wounded of both vessels, to accept their best thanks.

The Enterprize has but one eighteen pound shot in her hull, one in her mainmast, and one in her foremast ; her sails are much cut with grape shot, and there are a great number of grape lodged in her sides, but no injury done by them. The Boxer has eighteen or twenty eighteen pound shot in her hull, most of them at the water's edge \u2014 several stands of eighteen pound grape stick in her side, and such a quantity of small grape that I did not undertake to count them. Her masts, sails and spars are literally cut to pieces, several of her guns dismount\u2122 and unfit for service ; her top gallant foreea^tle\\early taken off by the shot, her boats cut to pieces,and her quarters injured in proportion. To"], [135, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 117 give you an idea of the quantity of shot about her, I inform you that I counted in her mainmast alone three eighteen pound shot holes, eighteen large grape shot holes, sixteen musket ball holes, and a large number of smaller shot holes, without count ing above the cat harpins. \" We find it impossible to get at the number kil led ; no papers are found by which Ave can ascer tain it \u2014 I, however, counted upwards of ninety hammocks which were in her netting with beds in them, besides several beds without hammocks ; and she has excellent accommodations for all her officers beloAV in state-rooms, so that I have no doubt that she had one hundred men on board. We knoAv that she has several of the Rattler's men on board, and a quantity of wads was taken out of the Rattler, loaded with four large grape shot, with a small hole in the centre to put in a cartridge that the inside of the wad may take fire when it leaves the gun. In short, she is in every respect completely fitted, and her accommodations exceed any thing I have seen in a vessel of her class.\" A publick dinner was given at Portland to lieu tenant M'Call and the other officers of the Enter prize, for their gallant conduct in the action with the Boxer."], [136, "118 NAVAL TEMPLE. THE ESSEX. Captain Porter, in the frigate Essex, proceed- ed to sea from the Delaware, on the tAventy- seventh of October, 1812, and repaired, agreeably to instructions from commodore Bainbridge, to the coast of Brazil, Avhere different places of rendez- vous had been arranged between them. In the course of his cruise on this coast he captured his Britannick majesty's packet Nocton, and after tak- ing out of her about eleven thousand pounds sterl- ing in specie, ordered her for America. Hearing of commodore Bainbridge's victorious action with the Java, which would oblige him to return to port, and of the capture of the Hornet by the Montague, and learning that there was a considerable augmen- tation of British force on the coast, and several ships in pursuit of him, he abandoned his hazardous cruising ground, and stretched away to the south- ward, scouring the coast as far as Rio de la Plata. From thence he shaped his course for the Pacifick Ocean, and, after suffering greatly for want of pro- visions, and heavy gales off Cape Horn, arrived at Valparaiso, on the 14th of March, 1813. Having victualled his ship, he ran doAvn the coast of Chili and Peru, and fell in Avith a Peruvian corsair, hav ing on board twenty-four Americans, as prisoners, the crews of two Avhaling ships, which she had taken on the coast of Chili. The Peruvian captain justi-"], [137, "119 NAVAL TEMPLE. fled his conduct on the plea of being an ally of Great Britain, and the expectation likewise of a speedy war between Spain and the United States. Finding him resolved to persist in similar aggres sions, captain Porter threw all his guns and ammu nition into the sea, liberated the Americans, and wrote a respectful letter to the viceroy explaining his reasons for so doing, which he delivered to the captain. He then proceeded to Lima, and luckily recaptured one of the American vessels as she was entering the port. After this he cruised for several months in the Pacifick, inflicting immense injury on the British commerce in those waters. He was particularly destructive to the shipping employed in the sper maceti whale fisherv. A great number with valua ble cargoes were captured ; two were given up to the prisoners ; three sent to Valparaiso and laid up ; three sent to America ; one of them he retained as a storeship, and another he equipped with twenty guns, called the Essex junior,and gave the command of her to lieutenant Downes. Most of these ships mounted several guns, and had numerous crews; and as several of them were captured by boats or by prizes, the officers and men of the Essex had frequent opportunities of shoAving their skill and courage, and of acquiring experience and confi dence in naval conflict. Having now a little squadron under his com mand, captain Porter became a complete terror in those seas. As his numerous prizes supplied him"], [138, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 120 abundantly with provisions, clothing, medicine, and naval stores of every description, he was enabled for a long time to keep the sea, without sickness or inconvenience to his crew; living entirely on the enemy, and being enabled to make considerable ad vances of pay to his officers and creAV without draw ing on government. The unexampled devastation achieved by his daring enterprises, not only spread alarm throughout the ports of the Pacifick, but even occasioned great uneasiness in Great Britain. Numerous ships were sent out to the Pacifick in pursuit of him ; others were ordered to cruise in the China seas, off New Zealand, Timor and New Hol land, and a frigate sent to the river La Plata. The manner in which captain Porter cruised, however, completely baffled pursuit. Keeping in the open seas, or lurking among the numerous barren and desolate islands that form the Gallipagos groupe, and never touching on the American coast, he left no traces by which he could be followed ; rumour, Avhile it magnified his exploits, threw his pursuers at fault ; they were distracted by vague accounts of captures made at different places, and of frigates supposed to be the Essex hovering at the same time off different coasts and haunting different islands. In the mean Avhile captain Porter, though Avrap ped in mystery and uncertainty himself, yet received frequent and accurate accounts of his enemies, from the various prizes which he had taken. Lieuten ant Downes, also, who had convoyed the prizes to Valparaiso, on his return, brought advices of the"], [139, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 121 expected arrival of commodore Hillyar in the Ph\u0153be frigate rating thirty-six guns accompanied by two sloops of Avar. Glutted with spoil and havock, and sated with the easy and inglorious cap tures of merchantmen, captain Porter now felt eager for an opportunity to meet the enemy on equal terms, and to signalize his cruise by some brilliant achievement. Having been nearly a year at sea, he found that his ship would require some repairs, to enable her to face the foe ; he re paired, therefore, accompanied by several of his prizes, to the Island of Nooaheevah, one of the Washington group, discovered by a captain Ingra ham of Boston. Here he landed, took formal pos session of the island in the name of the government of the United States, and gave it the name of Madi son's Island. He found it large, populous and fer tile, abounding with the necessaries of life ; the natives in the vicinity of the harbour which he had chosen received him in the most friendly manner, and supplied him Avith abundance of provisions. During his stay at this place he had several encoun ters with some hostile tribes on the island, whom he succeeded in reducing to subjection. Having calk ed and completely overhaled the ship, made for her a new set of Avater casks, and taken on board from the prizes provisions and stores for upAvards of four months, he sailed for the coast of Chili on the 12th December, 1813. Previous to sailing he se cured the three prizes Avhich had accompanied him, under the guns of a battery erected for their pro- 16"], [140, "122 NAVAL TEMPLE. section, and left them in charge of lieutenant Gamble of the marines and twenty-one men, with orders to proceed to Valparaiso after a certain period. After cruising on the coast of Chili without suc cess, he proceeded to Valparaiso, in hopes of falling in with commodore Hillyar, or, if disappointed in this wish, of capturing some merchant ships said to be expected from England. While at anchor at this port, commodore Hillyar arrived, having long been searching in vain for the Essex, and almost despairing of ever meeting with her. Contrary to the expectations of captain Porter, however, com modore Hillyar, besides his own frigate, superior in itself to the Essex, was accompanied by the Cherub sloop of war, strongly armed and manned. These ships, having been sent out expressly to seek for the Essex, were in prime order and equipment, Avith picked creAvs, and hoisted flags bearing the motto \" God and country, British sailors' best rights : traitors offend both.\" This was in opposi tion to captain Porter's motto of \" Free trade and sailors' rights,\" and the latter part of it suggested doubtless, by errour industriously cherished, that our crews are chiefly composed of English seamen. In reply to this motto captain Porter hoisted at his mizzen, \" God, our country, and liberty : tyrants offend them.\" On entering the harbour the Ph\u0153be fell foul of the Essex in such manner as to lay her at the mercy of captain Porter ; out of respect, however, to the neutrality of the port, he did not take advantage of her exposed situation. This for-"], [141, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 123 bearance was afterwards acknowledged by commo dore Hillyar, and he passed his word of honour to observe like conduct while they remained in port. They continued therefore, while in harbour and on shore, in the mutual exchange of courtesies and kind offices that should characterise the private inter course between civilized and generous enemies. And the crews of the respective ships often mingled together and passed nautical jokes and pleasantries from one to the other. On getting their provisions on board, the Ph\u0153be and Cherub went off the port, where they cruised for six weeks, rigorously blockading captain Porter. Their united force amounted to eighty-one guns and five hundred men, in addition to which they took on board the crew of an English letter of marque lying in port. The force of the Essex con sisted of but forty-six guns, all of which, excepting six long twelves, w^ere twenty-two pound carron ades, only serviceable in close fighting. Her creAv, having been much reduced by the manning of prizes, amounted to but two hundred and fifty-five men. The Essex junior being only intended as a store ship, mounted ten eighteen pound carronades and ten short sixes Avith a complement of only sixty men. This vast superiority of force on the part of the enemy prevented all chance of encounters on any thing like equal terms, unless by express coATenant between the commanders. Captain Porter, there fore, endeavoured repeatedly to provoke a chal-"], [142, "124 NAVAL TEMPLE. lenge, (the inferiority of his frigate to the Ph\u0153be not justifying him in making the challenge himself,) but without effect. He tried frequently also to bring the Ph\u0153be into single action ; but this commodore Hillyar Avarily avoided, and always kept his ships so close together as to frustrate captain Porter's attempts. Finding it impossible to bring the enemy to equal combat; and fearing the arrival of additional force, Avhich he understood was on the way, captain Por ter determined to put to sea the first opportunity that should present. A rendezvous was accordingly appointed for the Essex junior, and having ascer tained by repeated trials that the Essex was a supe rior sailer to either of the blockading ships, it was agreed that she should let the enemy chase her off; thereby giving the Essex junior an opportunity of escaping. On the next day, the 28th March, the wind came on to bloAv fresh from the southward, and the Essex parted her larboard cable and dragged her star board anchor directly out to sea. Not a moment Avas lost in getting sail on the ship; but perceiv ing that the enemy Avas close in with the point forming the west side of the bay, and that there was a possibility of passing to windward, and es caping to sea by superior sailing, captain Porter resolved* to hazard the attempt. He accordingly took in his top-gallant-sails and braced up for the purpose, but most unfortunately on rounding the point a heavy squall struck the ship and carried"], [143, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 125 away her main-top-mast, precipitating the men Avho Avere aloft into the sea, avIio were drowned. Both ships now gave chase, and the crippled state of his ship left captain Porter no alternative but to en deavour to regain the port. Finding it impossible to get back to the common anchorage, he ran close into a small bay about three quarters of a mile to leeward of the battery, on the east of the harbour, and let go his anchor within pistol shot of the shore. Supposing the enemy would, as formerly, respect the neutrality of the place, he considered himself secure, and thought only of repairing the damages he had sustained. The wary and menacing ap proach of the hostile ships, however, displaying their motto flags and having jacks at all their masts' heads, soon showed him the real danger of his situa tion. With all possible despatch he got his ship ready for action, and endeavoured to get a spring on his cable, but had not succeeded, when, at fifty four minutes past three p. m. the enemy commenced an attack. At first the Ph\u0153be lay herself under his stern and the Cherub on his starboard bow ; but the latter soon finding herself exposed to a hot fire, bore up and ran under his stern also, where both ships kept up a severe and raking fire. Captain Porter suc ceeded three different times in getting springs on his cables, for the purpose of bringing his broadside to bear on the enemy, but they were as often shot away by the excessive fire to which he was exposed. He was obliged, therefore, to rely for defence"], [144, "126 NAVAL TEMPLE. against Ihis tremendous attack merely on three long twelve pounders, which he had ran. out of the stern ports ; and Avhich were worked with such bravery and skill, as in half an hour to do great injury to both the enemy's ships, and induce them to hale off and repair damages. It was evidently the intention of commodore Hillyar to risk nothing from the daring courage of his antagonist, but to take the Essex at as cheap a rate as possible. All his ma n\u0153uvres Avere deliberate and wary; he saAv his antagonist completely at his mercy, and prepared to cut him up in the safest and surest manner. In the mean time the situation of the Essex was gall ing and provoking in the extreme ; crippled and shattered, with many killed and wounded, she lay awaiting the convenience of the enemy, to renew the scene of slaughter, with scarce a hope of escape or revenge. Her brave crew, however, in place of being disheartened, were aroused to desperation, and by hoisting ensigns in their rigging, and jacks in different parts of the ship, evinced their defiance and determination to hold out to the last. The enemy having repaired his damages, now placed himself, Avith both his ships, on the starboard quarter of the Essex, out of reach of her carron ades, and Avhere her stern guns could not be brought to bear. Here he kept up a most destructive fire, Avhich it Avas not in captain Porter's poAver to return ; the latter, therefore, saAv no hope of injuring him Avithout getting under way and becoming the as sailant. From the mangled state of his rigging, he"], [145, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 127 could set no other sail than the flying jib ; this he caused to be hoisted, cut his cable, and ran down on both ships, with an intention of laying the Ph\u0153be on board. For a short time he was enabled to close Avith the enemy, and the firing on both sides Avas tremendous. The decks of the Essex were strewed Avith dead, and her cockpit filled Avith Avounded ; she had been several times on sire, and Avas in fact a perfect wreck ; still a feeble hope sprung up that she might be saved, in consequence of the Cherub being compelled to hale off by her crippled state ; she did not return to close action again, but kept up a dis tant firing with her long guns. The disabled state of the Essex, however, did not permit her to take advantage of this circumstance ; for want of sail she was unable to keep at close quarters with the Ph\u0153be, who, edging off, chose the distance which best suited her long guns, and kept up a tremen dous fire, which made dreadful havock among our creAv. Many of the guns of the Essex Avere ren dered useless, and many had their Avhole creAvs destroyed \u2014 they were manned from those that Avere disabled, and one gun in particular Avas three times manned ; fifteen men were slain at it in the course *if the action, though the captain of it escaped Avith only a slight wound. Captain Porter noAv gave up all hope of closing with the enemy, but finding the wind favourable, determined to run his ship on shore, land the creAV, and destroy her. He had ap proached Avithin musket shot of the shore, and had"], [146, "128 NAVAL TEMPLE. every prospect of succeeding, when, in an instant, the Avind shifted from the land and drove her doAvn upon the Ph\u0153be, exposing her again to a dreadful raking fire. The ship was now totally unmanage able ; yet as her head was toward the enemy, and he to leeAvard, captain Porter again perceived a faint hope of boarding. At this moment lieutenant Downes, of the Essex junior, came on board to re ceive orders, expecting that captain Porter would soon be a prisoner. His services could be of no avail in the deplorable state of the Essex, and find ing from the enemy's putting his helm up, that the last attempt at boarding would not succeed, captain Porter directed him, after he had been ten minutes on board, to return to his oAvn ship, to be prepared for defending and destroying her in case of attack. He took with him several of the Avounded, leaving three of his boat's crew on board to make room for them. The Cherub kept up a hot fire on him dur ing his return. The slaughter on board of the Essex noAV became horrible ; the enemy continued to rake her, while she was unable to bring a gun to bear in return. Still her commander, Avith an obstinacy that bordered on desperation, persisted in the une qual and almost hopeless conflict. Every expedient that a fertile and inventive mind could suggest Avas resorted to, in the forlorn hope that they might yet be enabled by some lucky chance to escape from the grasp of the foe. A halser Avas bent to the sheet anchor, and the anchor cut from the bows, to bring the ship's head round. This succeeded; the"], [147, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 129 broadside of the Essex was again brought to bear; and as the enemy was much crippled and unable to hold his own, captain Porter thought she might drift out of gunshot before she discovered that he had anchored. The halser, however, unfortunately parted, and with it failed the last lingering hope of the Essex. The ship had taken fire several times during the action, but at this moment her situation was aAvful. She was on fire both forward and aft ; the flames were bursting up each hatchway ; a large quantity of powder below exploded, and word Avas given that the fire Avas near the magazine. Thus surrounded by horrours, without any chance of saving the ship, captain Porter turned his attention to rescuing as many of his brave companions as pos sible. Finding his distance from the shore did not exceed three quarters of a mile, he hoped many would be able to save themselves should the ship bloAv up. His boats had been cut to pieces by the enemy's shot, but he advised such as could swim to jump overboard and make for shore. Some reached it \u2014 some were taken by the enemy, and some perished in the attempt ; but most of this loyal and gallant crew preferred sharing the fate of their ship and their commander. Those who remained on board noAv endeavoured to extinguish the flames, and having succeeded, went again to the guns and kept up a firing for a few minutes ; but the creAv had by this time become so weakened that all further resistance Avas in vain. Captain Porter summoned a consultation of the IT"], [148, "130 NAVAL TEMPLE. officers of divisions, but was surprised to find only acting lieutenant Stephen Decatur M 'Knight re maining ; of the others some had been killed, others knocked overboard, and others carried beloAv dis abled by severe wounds. The accounts from every part of the ship were deplorable in the extreme; representing her in the most shattered and crippled condition, in imminent danger of sinking, and so crowded Avith the Avounded that even the birth deck could contain no more, and many were killed while under the surgeon's hands. In the mean Avhile the enemy, in consequence of the smoothness of the Avater and his secure distance, was enabled to keep up a deliberate and constant fire, aiming with cool ness and certainty as if firing at a target, and hitting the hull at every shot. At length, utterly despair ing of saving the ship, captain Porter was compelled, at tAventy minutes past six p. m. to give the painful order to strike the colours. It is probable the enemy did not perceive that the ship had surrender ed, for he continued firing ; several men were killed and Avounded in different parts of the ship, and cap tain Porter thinking he intended to show no quar ter, was about to rehoist his flag and to fight until he sunk, Avhen the enemy desisted his attack ten minutes after the surrender. The loss of the Essex is a sufficient testimony of the desperate bravery with which she was defended. Out of tAvo hundred and fifty-five men which com prised her crew, fifty-eight were killed ; thirty-nine Founded severely ; twenty-seven slightly ; and thir-"], [149, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 131 ty-one missing, making in all one hundred and fifty four. She was completely cut to pieces, and so covered with the dead and dying, with mangled limbs, with brains and blood, and all the ghastly images of pain and death, that the officer who came on board to take possession of her, though accustom ed to scenes of slaughter, was struck with sicken ing horrour, and fainted at the shocking spectacle. Thousands of the inhabitants of Valparaiso were spectators of the battle, covering the neighbouring heights : for it was fought so near the shore that some of the shot even struck among the citizens, who, in the eagerness of their curiosity, had ven tured down upon the beach. Touched by the for lorn situation of the Essex, and filled with admira tion at the unflagging spirit and persevering bravery of her commander and crew, a generous anxiety ran throughout the multitude for their fate : bursts of delight arose when, by any vicissitude of battle, or prompt expedient, a chance seemed to turn up in their favour ; and the eager spectators were seen to wring their hands, and uttered groans of sympathy, when the transient hope was defeated, and the gal lant little frigate once more became an unresisting object of deliberate slaughter. Though, from the distance and positions Avhich the enemy chose, this battle was chiefly fought on our part by six twelve pounders only, yet great damage Avas done to the assailing ships. Their masts and yards were badly crippled, their hulls much cut up ; the Ph\u0153be, especially, received eighteen tAvelve"], [150, "132 NAVAL TEMPLE. pound shot below her water line, some three feet under water. Their loss in killed and wounded was not ascertained, but must have been severe ; the first lieutenant of the Ph\u0153be was killed, and captain Tucker, of the Cherub, Avas severely wounded. It was with some difficulty that the Ph\u0153be and the Essex could be kept afloat until they anchored the next morning in the port of Valparaiso. Much indignation has been expressed against commodore Hillyar for his violation of the laws of nations, and of his private agreement with captain Porter, by attacking him in the neutral waters of Valparaiso. His cautious attack with a vastly superior force, on a crippled ship, which, relying on his forbearance, had placed herself in a most de fenceless situation, and which for six weeks pre vious had offered him fair fight, on advantageous terms, though it may reflect great credit on his prudence, yet certainly furnishes no triumph to a brave and generous mind. Captain Porter and his creAv Avere paroled, and permitted to return to the United States in the Es sex junior, her armament being pre\\iously taken out. On arriving off the port of New York, they Avere overhaled by the Saturn razee, the authority of commodore Hillyar to grant a passport Avas questioned, and the Essex junior detained. Cap tain Porter then told the boarding officer that he gave up his parole, and considered himself a prison er of war, and as such should use all means of escape. In consequence of this threat the Essex"], [151, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 133 junior was ordered to remain all night under the lee of the Saturn, but the next morning captain Porter put off in his boat, though thirty miles from shore ; and, notwithstanding he was pursued by the Saturn, effected his escape, and landed safely on Long Island. His reception in the United States has been such as his great services and distinguished valour deserved. The various interesting and ro mantick rumours that had reached this country concerning him, during his cruise in the Pacifick, had excited the curiosity of the publick to see this modern Sinbad. On arriving in New York his car riage was surrounded by the populace, Avho took out the horses, and dragged him, Avith shouts and acclamations, to his lodgings. THE ALLIGATOR. Towards the latter part of January, 1814, the United States schooner Alligator, mounting eight or ten guns, with a complement of forty men, was attacked in Stono river (six miles south of the channel of Charleston, S. C.) by six boats from the enemy's squadron off the mouth of the river, having on board one hundred and forty men, and succeeded in beating them off, after a warm action of thirty minutes, in which the enemy suffered very severely. The loss, on board the Alligator was two killed and t\\vo Avounded. Great credit is due to her com-"], [152, "134 NAVAL TEMPLE. mander, sailing-master Dent, and crew, for defeat in o- a force so greatly superior in numbers. The Alligator was afterwards lost in a severe gale, and twenty-three of her men drowned. CRUISE OF COMMODORE RODGERS. On the 18th of February, commodore Rodgers arrived at Sandy Hook, off New York, after a cruise of seventy-five days, during which he cap tured a number of British merchant vessels, and narrowly escaped at different times, a very superior force of the enemy. PEACOCK AND EPERVIER. On the 29th of April, in latitude 27 47, longi tude 80 9, the United States sloop of war Peacock, captain Warrington, of twenty guns and one hun dred and sixty men, captured, after an action of forty-two minutes, the British brig Epervier of eighteen guns and one hundred and tAventy-eight men, having on board one hundred and twenty thousand dollars in specie. The loss on board the Epervier was eight killed and thirteen wounded ; among the latter was her first lieutenant, who lost an arm and received a severe splinter Avound on the"], [153, "135 NAVAL TEMPLE. hip. Not a man in the Peacock was killed, and only two Avounded ; and the injury sustained by the vessel was so trifling that in fifteen minutes alter the Epervier struck, she was ready for another action. When the enemy struck, he had five feet of wa ter in his hold, his main-top-mast was over the side, his main boom shot away, his foremast cut nearly in two and tottering, his bowsprit badly wounded, and forty-five shot holes in his hull, twenty of which were within a foot of his water line. By great ex ertions, the Epervier was got in sailing order in the course of the day. On the 1st of May, the Epervier arrived at Sa vannah ; and on the 4th, the Peacock reached the same place, after having been separated from her prize and chased for four or five days by a superior force of enemy's vessels. The Peacock shortly sailed again, and arrived at New York toward the latter part of October, from a cruise of one hundred and forty-seven days, hav ing made fourteen prizes, valued at four hundred and ninety-four thousand two hundred and twenty two dollars ; twelve of the prizes were burnt or sunk, and two made cartels for prisoners."], [154, "136 NAVAL TEMPLE. CRUISE OF THE WASP.\u2014 CAPTURE OF THE REINDEER. On the 1st of May, the United States sloop of war Wasp, of eighteen guns and one hundred and seventy-three men, captain Blakely commander, sailed from Portsmouth, N. H. on a cruise, and on the 28th of June, in latitude 48 36, longitude 1115, after having made several captures, she fell in with, engaged, and after an action of nineteen minutes, captured his Britannick majesty's sloop of war Reindeer, William Manners, esquire, commander. The Reindeer mounted sixteen tAventy-four pound carronades, two long six or nine pounders, and a shifting tAvelve pound carronade, Avith a comple ment on board of one hundred and eighteen men. She Avas literally cut to pieces in a line with her ports ; her upper works, boats and spare spars Avere one complete wreck, and a breeze springing up the day after the action, her foremast Avent by the board; Avhen the prisoners having been taken on board the Wasp, she was set on fire and soon bleAV up. The loss on board the Reindeer was twenty three killed and forty-tAvo Avounded, her captain being among the former. On board the Wasp five were killed and twenty-one wounded. More than one half of the wounded enemy Avere, in consequence of the severity and extent of their wounds, put on board a Portuguese brig and sent to England. \u2014 The"], [155, "137 NAVAL TEMPLE. loss of the Americans, although not as severe as that of the British, was owing, in a degree, to the prox imity of the tAvo vessels during the action, and the extreme smoothness of the sea, but chiefly in repel ling boarders. On the 8th of July, the Wasp put into L'Orient, France, after capturing an additional number of prizes, Avhere she remained until the 27th of Au gust, when she again sailed on a cruise. On the 1st of September she fell in with the British sloop of war Avon, of twenty guns, commanded by cap tain Abuthnot, and after an action of forty-five minutes, compelled her to surrender, her creAv being nearly all killed or wounded. The guns Avere then ordered to be secured, and a boat lower ed from the Wasp in order to take possession of the prize. In the act of lowering the boat, a second enemy's vessel was discovered astern and standing toAvards the Wasp. Captain Blakely immediately ordered his crew to their quarters, prepared every thing for action, and awaited her coming up. In a feAv minutes after, two additional sail were discover ed bearing down upon the Wasp. Captain Blakely stood off with the expectation of drawing the first from its companions ; but in this he was disappoint ed. She continued to approach until she came close to the stern of the Wasp, when she haled by the wind, fired her broadside, (which injured the Wasp but trifling,) and retraced her steps to join her consorts. Captain Blakely Avas now necessi tated to abandon the Avon, which had by this time 18"], [156, "138 NAVAL TEMPLE. become a total Avreck, and which soon after sunk, the surviving part of her crew having barely time to escape to the other enemy's vessels. On board the Avon forty were killed and sixty Avounded. The loss sustained by the Wasp was two killed and one wounded. The Wasp afterwards continued her cruise, making great havock among English merchant ves sels and privateers, destroying an immense amount of the enemy's property. From the 1st of May until the 20th of September, she had captured fifteen vessels, most of which she destroyed. LOSS OF THE PRESIDENT. On the 14th of January, the frigate President, the command of which had been assigned to com modore Decatur, mailed from NeAv York on a cruise. Owing to a mistake of the pilots, the ship, in going out, grounded on the bar, where she continued to strike heavy for an hour and a half. Several of her rudder braces being broken, and other material injury sustained, commodore Decatur thought it advisable to return to port, which, however, he was prevented from doing by the strong westerly winds. Having succeeded in forcing her over the bar, he shaped his course along the shore of Long Island for fifty miles, and then s. e. by e. At five o'clock,"], [157, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 139 three ships were discovered ahead. The commo dore passed two miles to the northward of them. At daylight, he discovered four ships in chase, one on each quarter, and two astern, the leading ship being a razee, Avhich commenced a fire upon the President, but Avithout effect. At meridian he found that he increased his distance from the razee ; but the next ship astern, Avhich was the Endymion, mounting fifty guns, tAventv-four pounders, on the maindeck, had gained and continued to gain upon him considerably. All hands were occupied in lightening the ship by starting Avater, cutting away anchors, throwing overboard provisions, cables, spars, boats, and every article that could be got at, and keeping the sails wet from the royals doAvn. At three o'clock the enemy was joined by a brig, and was coming up with the President rapidly. The Endymion had approached within gunshot, and commenced a fire Avith her bow guns, which was returned from the stern of the President. At five o'clock, she obtained a position on the starboard quarter, within half point blank shot, on which commodore Decatur could not bring either his stern or quarter guns to bear. He remained in this position for half an hour, hoping that the enemy would close with him on his broadside, in which case he had prepared his men to board. The enemy, hoAvever, kept his position, and every fire cut some of the sails and rigging of the President. It was now dusk, and commodore Decatur altered his course, for the purpose of bringing the enemy"], [158, "140 NAVAL TEMPLE. abeam ; and although their ships astern were draw ing up fast, he felt satisfied he should be able to throAv his opponent out of the combat before they could come up ; and was not without hopes of es caping. The enemy, however, kept off at the same instant. They continued engaged, steering south, Avith steering sails set, tAvo hours and a half, when the Endymion Avas completely dismantled, and dropped entirely out of the action. The other ships of the squadron being in sight and almost within gunshot, commodore Decatur was of course compelled to abandon her. He then resumed his former course, to avoid, if possible, the remainder of the squadron, which he continued till eleven o'clock. At this time two fresh ships of the enemy, the Pomone and Tenedos, came up. The Pomone opened her fire upon the larboard boAV, within mus ket shot ; the Tenedos, about two cables length astern, taking a raking position on the quarter of the President. The other ships of the squadron, except the Endymion, were within gunshot. Thus situated, with about one fifth of his crew killed and Avounded, his ship crippled, and more than a four fold force opposed to him, without a chance of escape left, commodore Decatur thought it his duty to surrender. The loss on board the President was twenty-four killed and fifty-five wounded. Among the former were lieutenants Babbit, Hamilton and Howell. The loss of the enemy, was not ascertained. The Endymion had on board, in addition to her own"], [159, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 141 crew, one lieutenant, one master's mate, and fifty seamen, belonging to the Saturn, and when the ac tion ceased, was left motionless and unmanageable, until she bent neAV sails, rove new rigging, and fished her spars ; nor did she join the squadron till six hours after the action, and three hours after the surrender of the President. Commodore Decatur, and a part of his crew were put on board the Endymion, and was carried to Bermuda. Afret remaining on the island a few days, he was paroled, and sailed for the United States in the British frigate Narcissus. The ships, composing the squadron in this action, were the Majestic, Endymion, Pomone, Tenedos, and Dispatch. In his letter to the secretary of the navy, commo dore Decatur says, \" It is with emotions of pride I bear testimony to the gallantly and steadiness of every officer and man I had the honour to com mand on this occasion : and I feel satisfied, that the fact of their having beaten a force equal to them selves, in the presence, and almost under the guns of so vastly superior a force, when, too, it was almost self-evident, that, whatever their exertions might be, they must ultimately be captured, will be taken as evidence of what they would have performed, had the force opposed to them been in any degree equal.\""], [160, "142 NAVAL TEMPLE. CAPTURE OF THE CYANE AND LEVANT. On the evening of the 20th February, captain Stewart, of the United States frigate Constitution, off the island of Madeira, fell in with his Britan nick majesty's ships of war Cyane and Levant, when a spirited action commenced. \u2014 In forty minutes the Cyane struck her colours, being much cut up, and the Levant endeavoured to escape. The Constitu tion, after manning the prize, pursued the Levant ; and in half an hour came up with her, when she soon surrendered. The Levant mounted twenty-one guns, eighteen of which Avere thirty-two pound carronades, and her crew consisted of one hundred and sixty officers, seamen and marines, commanded by captain Doug lass. Her loss in killed was twenty-three, and Avounded sixteen. The Cyane mounted thirty-four guns, (twenty two thirty-tAvo pound carronades, ten eighteen pound do. and two long nine pounders,) and her crew consisted of one hundred and sixty-eight offi cers, seamen and marines, commanded by captain Falcon. Her loss in killed Avas twelve, and Avounded twenty-six. The Constitution received but little injury ; her loss in killed was three, and wounded twelve. On the 9th of March the Constitution with her two prizes anchored off the Isle of May, (one of the Cape-de-Verd islands.) \u2014 On the 10th she got"], [161, "NAVAL TEMPLE, 143 under way, and made sail for St. JagO, where she anchored. On the 12th, captain Stewart discoA^ered three British frigates standing for Port Pray a; and considering the little respect heretofore paid by British vessels to neutral Avaters, he deemed it ex pedient to get under way. Signals Avere according ly made for this purpose, when the Portuguese opened a fire upon captain Stewart from several of their batteries, and the British frigates discovering the movements of our vessels, gave immediate chase. After continuing the chase for three or four hours, they succeeded in separating the Levant from the other vessels, when she tacked and stood for the harbour, her commanding officer, lieutenant Ballard, hoping the neutrality of the port might protect him : but in this he Avas disappointed. For after anchoring in four fathom water, and within one hundred and fifty yards of the shore, he was wantonly attacked by the British frigates, (Avhich had chased him in) when, finding all further resis tance vain, he was compelled to strike his colours. On the 8th of April, the Cyane, commanded by lieutenant Hoffman, arrived in safety at NeAv York ; and on the 15th of May captain Stewart arrived at the same place in the Constitution, after a cruise of about five months \u2014 having heard of the ratification of a treaty of peace between Great Britain and America about a fortnight previous to his arrival."], [162, "144 NAVAL TEMPLE. The following particulars of the capture of the Cyane and Levant, of the escape of the Constitution with one of them, and the subsequent recapture of the other by a British fleet, are given by captain Stewart, in his official letter, and may perhaps be more gratifying to the nautical reader, than our preceding brief relation. Minutes of the action between the United States frigate Constitu- tion and his majesty's ships Cyane and Levant, on the 20th February, 1815. Commences with light breezes from the east, and cloudy weather. At one p. m. discovered a sail two points on the larboard bow \u2014 hauled up, and made sail in chase. At a quarter past one, made the sail to be a ship ; at three quarters past one, dis covered another sail ahead ; made them out, at two, to be both ships, standing close hauled, Avith their starboard tacks on board ; at four, the weathermost ship made signals, and bore up for her consort, then about ten miles to leeward ; Ave bore up after her, and set lower top-mast, top-gallant and royal stud ding sails, in chase ; at hall\" past four, carried away our main royal-mast; took in the sails, and got another prepared. At five, commenced firing on the chase from our two larboard boAv guns ; our shot falling short, ceased firing : at half past five, finding it impossible to prevent their junction, cleared ship for action, then about four miles from the two ships ; and forty minutes past five, they passed within hail"], [163, "145 NAVAL TEMPLE. of each other, and hauled by the wind on the star board tack, hauled up their courses, and prepared to receive us : at forty-five minutes past five, they made all sail close hauled by the wind, in hopes of getting to windward of us : at fifty-five minutes past five, finding themselves disappointed in their object, and we were closing with them fast, they shortened sail, and formed on a line of wind, about half a cable's length of each other : at six, having them under command of our battery, hoisted our colours, which was ansAvered by both ships hoisting English ensigns : at five minutes past six, ranged up on the starboard side of the sternmost ship, about three hundred yards distant, and commenced the action by broadsides, both ships returning our fire with great spirit for about fifteen minutes; then the fire of the enemy beginning to slacken, and the great column of smoke collected under our lee, in duced us to cease our fire to ascertain their posi tions and conditions : in about three minutes, the smoke clearing aAvay, Ave found ourselves abreast of the headmost ship, the sternmost ship luffed up for our larboard quarter ; Ave poured a broadside into the headmost ship, and then braced aback our main and mizzen-top-sails, and backed astern under cover of the smoke, abreast the sternmost ship, when the action was continued with spirit and considerable effect, until thirty-five minutes past six, when the enemy's fire again slackened, and Ave discovered the headmost bearing up ; filled our topsails, shot ahead, and gave her tAvo stern rakes ; we then 19"], [164, "146 NAVAL TEMPLE. discovered the sternmost ship wearing also ; Avore ship immediately after her, and gave her a stern rake \u2014 she luffed to on our starboard boAvs, and gave us her larboard broadside : wTe ranged up on her larboard quarter, within hail, and Avere about to give her our starboard broadside, Avhen she struck her colours, fired a lee gun, and yielded. At fifty minutes past six, took possession of his majesty's ship Cyane, captain Gordon Falcon, mounting thirty-four guns. At eight, filled away after her consort, which was still in sight to leeward. At, half past eight, found her standing towards us, with her starboard tacks close hauled, Avith top-gallant sails set, and colours flying. At five minutes past eight, ranged close along side to windward of her, on opposite tacks, and exchanged broadsides \u2014 wore immediately under her stern, and raked her with a broadside : she then crowded all sail, and endea voured to escape by running \u2014 hauled on board our tacks, set spanker, and flying jib in chase. At half past nine, commenced firing on her from our star board bow chaser ; gave her several shot, which cut her spars and rigging considerably. At ten, finding she could not escape, fired a gun, struck her colours, and yielded. We immediately took possession of his majesty's ship Levant, honourable captain George Douglass, mounting tAventy-one guns. At one a. m. the damages of our rigging Avere repaired, sails shifted, and the ship in fighting condition.\""], [165, "147 NAVAL temple. Minutes of the chase of the United States frigate Constitution, by an English squadron of three ships, from out the harbour of Port Praya, island of St. J ago : \u2014 Commences with fresh breezes and thick foggy weather. At five minutes past twelve, discovered a large ship through the fog, standing in for Port Praya. At eight minutes past twelve, discovered two other large ships astern of her, also standing in for the port. From their general appearance sup posed them to be one of the enemy's squadrons, and from the little respect hitherto paid by them to neutral waters, I deemed it most prudent to put to sea. The signal was made to the Cyane and Le vant to get under way. At twelve minutes past twelve, with our topsails set, we cut our cable and got under way, (when the Portuguese opened a fire on us from several of their batteries on shore) the prize ships following our motions, and stood out of the harbour of Port Praya, close under East Point, passing the enemy's squadron about gunshot to windward of them ; crossed our top-gallant yards, and set foresail, mainsail, spanker, flying-jib and top gallant sails. The enemy seeing us under Avay, tacked ship and made all sail in chase of us. As far as Ave could judge of their rates, from the thick ness of the Aveather, supposed them tAvo ships of the line and one frigate. At half past tAvelve, cut away the boats towing astern \u2014 first cutter and gig. At one p. m. found our sailing about equal Avith the ships on our lee quarter, but the frigate luffing up, gaining our Avake, and rather dropping astern of us ;"], [166, "148 NAVAL TEMPLE. finding the Cyane dropping astern and to leeward, and the frigate gaining on her fast, I found it impos sible to save her if she continued on the same course, without having the Constitution brought to action by their Avhole force. I made the signal at ten minutes past one, to her to tack ship, Avhich Ava? complied with. This man\u0153uvre, I conceived, Avould detach one of the enemy's ships in pursuit of her, while at the same time, from her position, she Avould be enabled to reach the anchorage at Port Praya, before the detached ship could come up Avith her; but if they did not tack after her, it would afford her an opportunity to double their rear, and make her escape before the wind. They all continued in full chase of the Levant and this ship ; the ship on our lee quarter firing broadsides, by divisions- \u2014 her shot falling short of us. At three, by our having dropped the Levant considerably, her situation became (from the position of the enemy's frigate) similar to the Cyane. It became necessary to separate also from the Levant, or risk this ship being brought to action to cover her. I made the signal at five minutes past three for her to tack, which was complied Avith. At twelve minutes past three, the whole of the enemy's squadron tacked in pursuit of the Levant, and gave up the pursuit of this ship. This sacrifice of the Levant became ne cessary for the preservation of the Constitution.

BLOCKADE OF CHESAPEAKE AND DELAWARE BAYS. The British government declared the Chesa peake and Delaware bays to be in a state of block ade. In the early part of the year, a squadron under the command of admiral Warren, was sent to the entrance of the Chesapeake to enforce this blockade. The first interesting event this blockade gave rise to, was the affair of the Lottery. This vessel mounted six guns, and had a crew of thirty-five men. In sailing out of the Chesapeake, in the month of February, she was attacked by nine large British boats, having on board two hundred and forty well armed men. She sustained their united attack upwards of an hour and a half, Avhen the British succeeded in boarding her, and pulled down her colours. The loss of the British exceeded the number of the crew of the Lottery. On the 3d of April, the privateer Dolphin of Bal timore, was captured after a long and gallant resis tance, by a number of barges and launches, belong ing to the blockading squadron. The British finally succeeded in capturing her, by boarding and over powering her crew by superior numbers. About the middle of May, a party of the British blockading squadron, sailed up to the head of the Chesapeake bay, where they captured and destroy ed a number of small vessels."], [168, "150 NAVAL TEMPLE. About the commencement of May, a large party of British marines and sailors, under the command of rear admiral Cockburn, successfully attacked the villages of FrenchtoAvn, Havre-de-grace, George toAvn and Fredericktown.\" These places were sit uated near the head of the Chesapeake, and con tained but feAv inhabitants. They of course could make but little resistance against a numerous body of assailants. The destruction committed by the British in these places was wanton in the extreme. The houses were set on fire. The furniture and other property of the inhabitants were either des troyed or conveyed on board their vessels. The squadron soon after returned doAvn the Chesapeake. On the 20th of June, commodore Cassin fitted out an expedition against some of the blockading frigates then in the vicinity of Crany Island. Fif teen gun boats Avere selected for this purpose, and put under the command of captain Tarbell. The attack Avas commenced from the gun boats upon a frigate about three quarters of a mile distant. Two other British frigates were in sight. The frigate sustained considerable injury, and Avould have been captured by the gun boats had not a breeze sprung up Avhich enabled the other two vessels to come to her assistance. The action however continued an hour and a half Avith the three frigates. Only one American was killed, and some others slightly Avounded. On the 22d of June, about three thousand British attempted to land on Crany Island, but were"], [169, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 151 repulsed. Three of their barges were sunk : one of them, belonging to admiral Warren's ship had seventy-five men in her, the greater part of Avhom were drowned ; a number of prisoners were taken. Many of the enemy also deserted. The American troops on the island consisted of about five hundred land troops under the command of lieutenant-colonel Beaty ; and one hundred and fifty marines, and sailors, under the command of lieutenants Neale, Shubrick, Saunders, and Brackenridge. On the 25th of June, about two thousand five hundred British attacked the town of Hampton. The American force stationed there amounted to about four hundred, under the command of major Crutchfield. This small body of Americans op posed the very superior British force, with the utmost gallantry for a considerable time, when, overcome by numbers, they retreated, and the Brit ish took possession of Hampton, where the most inhuman and shocking acts were committed by them. Several of the defenceless and unfortunate females that remained in the place suffered every indecency and violence. Property to a large amount Avas most Avantonly destroyed. On the 14th of July the United States schooner Asp, of three guns and twenty-one men, in the Chesapeake bay, being attacked by several British vessels, ran up a creek, Avhither she Avas pursued by three boats, well manned and armed ; but the assail ants were soon compelled to retreat. After the lapse of an hour, the Asp Avas again attacked by five"], [170, "152 NAVAL TEMPLE. boats, the crews of Avhich succeeded in boarding her. The creAV of the Asp retreated on shore. The British set fire to the vessel and left her. The fire however was extinguished by the Americans. The loss of the latter in killed and wounded amounted to ten. On the 18th of July, an attempt was made in the Chesapeake bay, to blow up the Plantaganet, a seventy-four, by means of a torpedo. Mr. Mix, the projector of the scheme, had approached within forty fathoms of her, and dropped the torpedo ; Avhen he Avas hailed by one of the British guard boats. He instantly dreAv his machine into the boat and escaped. On the following night he made a second attempt, but was again discovered. In the night of the 20th, he made a third attempt, and got Avithin fifteen yards of the ship's bow, and directly under her jib-boom, where he continued fifteen minutes making preparations, Avhen a sentinel from the forecastle hailed \" Boat ahoy.\" The sentinel not being answered, fired his musket at the now retreating adventurer, to which a rapid discharge of small arms succeeded. Blue lights Avere resort ed to in order to find out the position of the boat, but failed. Rockets were then throAvn which il lumined the Avater to a considerable extent, and discovered the boat. A heavy discharge of cannon immediately commenced. The Plantaganet slip ped her cable, and made some sail, Avhile her boats Avere sent in pursuit. But the daring American escaped unhurt. Unsuccessful attempts Avere made"], [171, "153 NAVAL TEMPLE. the three following nights. But on the 24th Mr. Mix took his position within one hundred yards of the Plantaganet, and in a direction with her lar board bow. The machine Avas dropped into the water, and the same moment the sentinel cried \"All's well :\" the tide swept it toAvards the vessel, but it exploded a feAv seconds.too soon. A column of Avater fifty feet in circumference was thrown up thirty or forty feet. Its appearance Avas a vivid red, tinged with purple at the sides. The summit of the column burst with a tremendous explosion, and fell on the deck of the Plantaganet in torrents, while she rolled into the yawning chasm beloAV, and nearly upset. She hoAvever received but little injury. In the month of July, the blockading squadron again sailed up the Chesapeake and entered the Potomac : they however effected nothing. Soon after returning out of the river they sailed toAvard the head of the Chesapeake. They landed on Kent Island, where they remained for some time, Avhen they again returned doAvn the bay. On the 6th of April the blockading squadron in the Delaware bay commenced a cannonade on LeAv istoAvn, the inhabitants of which had refused com plying Avith an order of the English commodore, to supply the squadron with provisions. The cannon ade lasted about twenty-two hours : a number of eighteen and thirty-tAvo pound shot were fired, likewise shells and Congreve rockets; but pro duced little or no effect \u2014 not a life Avas lost. The 20"], [172, "154 NAVAL TEMPLE. inhabitants of the place were prompt in repelling every attempt to land. On the 27th of July, one of the United States gun boats was captured in the Delaware by a supe rior force, after a very gallant defence, in which the British had seven men killed and twelve wounded.* GUN BOAT ACTION. On the 19th of May, commodore Lewis, com manding the United States flotilla on the New Vork station, discovered the enemy in pursuit of a brig under American colours, standing for Sandy Hook; when he ordered a detachment of eleven gun boats to proceed to sea and pass between the chase and the enemy, by which means to bring him to action, and give opportunity to the chase to es cape \u2014 all Avhich was effected ; and the enemy, after receiving the fire of the boats bore away. On the 23d, commodore Lewis engaged the enemy before New London, and opened a passage for forty sail of coasting vessels : the action lasted three hours, in which the flotilla suffered very little, and night coming on, the action ceased. The enemy's force consisted of two ships and a sloop of Avar, and from appearance suffered severely, as he was unAvilling to renew the action next morning. * Clark's Naval History, vol. i. p. 194 \u2014 197."], [173, "155 NAVAL TEMPLE. EVENTS ON LAKE ERIE. On the morning of the 8th of October, 1812, tw6 British vessels, the Detroit and the Caledonia, came doAvn Lake Erie, and anchored under the guns of the British fort Erie. Lieutenant Elliot, of the United States navy, who, at that time superintended the naval affairs on lake Erie, determined to attack, and if possible, to possess himself of them. About this time, a number of seamen were march ing from the sea shore to the lake. Early the day before the intended attack, he despatched a mes senger to hasten them forward. They arrived about twelve o'clock ; but he discovered that they had only twenty pistols, and neither cutlasses nor battle axes. On application to general Smyth, he was supplied with a few arms : and about fifty men were detached from the regulars, armed with mus kets. By four o'clock in the afternoon, lieutenant Elliot had his men selected and stationed in two boats, fifty in each. At one o'clock on the following morning, he put off from the mouth of Buffalo creek, under very disadvantageous circumstances, his men having scarcely had time to refresh them selves after a fatiguing march of five hundred miles. At three o'clock he came along side the British vessels. In the space often minutes he got possession of them, had secured the crews as prison-"], [174, "156 NAVAL TEMPLE. ers, and had them under Avay. The wind, unfor tunately, was not sufficiently strong to carry them against a rapid current into the lake, Avhere, he Avas informed, another vessel lay at anchor. He was obliged in running down the river, to pass the Brit ish forts, under a heavy fire of round, grape and cannister shot, from a number of pieces of heavy ordnance, and several pieces of flying artillery. Lieutenant Elliot Avas compelled to anchor at a distance of about four hundred yards from two of their batteries. After the discharge of the first gun he hailed the British officer, and observed to him, that if another gun were fired he would bring the prisoners on deck and expose them to the same fate Avith the Americans. But, notwithstanding they continued to keep up a constant and destructive fire, a moment's reflection determined him not to com mit an act of such barbarity. The Caledonia had been beached in as safe a position as circumstances Avould admit of, under one of the American bat teries at Black Rock. Lieutenant Elliot now brought all the guns of his vessel on her side next the enemy, and a fire was kept up until all his ammunition was expended. During the contest he endeavoured to get the De troit on the American side, but did not succeed. He then determined to drift down the river, out of reach of the British batteries, and make a stand against their flying artillery. He accordingly or dered the cable to be cut, and made sail with a very light breeze. At this moment he discovered"], [175, "157 NAVAL TEMPLE. that his pilot had abandoned him. He dropped astern for about ten minutes, when he was brought up on Squaw island, near the American shore. A boat with prisoners was sent on shore ; but, owing to the difficulty it met with, did not return. He, however, with the remainder of the prisoners and crew, succeeded in getting on shore. About eleven o'clock next morning, a company of British regulars from fort Erie, boarded the De troit, to destroy the military stores with which she was principally laden. But they Avere dislodged by a detachment of volunteers under the command of major Cyrenus Chapin. About three o'clock in the afternoon of the same day, the British a second time attempted to board the Detroit ; but were again repulsed. The Detroit mounted six long six pounders, and had a crew of fifty-six men. About thirty Ameri can prisoners were on board her. She was burnt by the Americans after they had taken the greater part of the stores out of her. The Caledonia mounted two small guns, and had a crew of tAvelve men. She had on board a cargo of furs, estimated at about one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. In March 1813, captain Perry arrived at the port of Erie, to take command) of the fleet there fitting out.

On the morning of the tenth of September the British fleet was discoATered by commodore Perry from Put in Bay, where he then lay at anchor. Commodore Perry immediately\" got under way Avith his squadron, and stood for the British fleet. The wind at that time was light from southwest."], [177, ""], [178, "B. A-TTIUE. OTF TEIR-IIE"], [179, "159 NAVAL TEMPLE. At fifteen minutes before twelve, the British com menced firing: and at five minutes before twelve, the action commenced on the part of the Americans. As the fire of the British, owing to their long guns, was very severe upon the Americans, and was prin cipally directed at the Lawrence, commodore Per ry resolved to close with them : he accordingly made sail, and ordered the other vessels to folIoAv. Every brace and bowline of the LaAvrence being shot away, she became unmanageable, notwith standing the great exertions of the sailing master. OCT o In this situation she sustained the action, within cannister distance, upwards of two hours, until every gun was rendered useless, and the greater part of her crew either killed or Avounded. After a display of skill and gallantry, Avhich, alone, would have been sufficient to have immortal ized commodore Perry \u2014 after defending his vessel against a far superior force, to the very last ex tremity, this illustrious hero, at a critical moment, when, to almost any other mind, the contest would have appeared hopeless, resolved to save his coun try's honour, or perish in the attempt. He there fore quitted the Lawrence in an open boat, and rowed off for the Niagara, to make one more dis play of his heroism and talents. In his passage, there were no less than three broadsides fired at him by the British vessels, Avhich he passed. Heaven interposed its protecting arm. He escaped the apparently inevitable destruction. He reached the Niagara in safety, and a breeze springing up,"], [180, "160 NAVAL TEMPLE. enabled captain Elliot, who commanded that vessel, to bring her into close action in a very gallant man ner. Captain Elliot anticipated the commodore's desires by volunteering to bring the schooners, which had, by the lightness of the wind, been kept astern, into close action. Some time after commo dore Perry had left the. Lawrence her flag was loAvered ; for having been so long exposed to nearly the whole fire of the British fleet, she was almost cut to pieces ; and the chief part of her crew dis abled, only eight men remaining capable of doing duty. The British however were not in a state to take possession of her, and circumstances soon per mitted her flag to be again hoisted. At forty-five minutes past two, the signal Avas made for close ac tion. As the Niagara was very little injured, com modore Perry determined to pass through the enemy's line with her. He accordingly bore up, and passed ahead of their two ships and a brig, giving a raking fire to them from his larboard side, at half pistol shot distance. The smaller vessels were by this time within grape and cannister dis tance, under the direction of captain Elliot. The severe and well directed fire from them and the Niagara, forced the two ships, the brig, and a schooner to surrender. A sloop and schooner at tempted to escape, but were overtaken and cap tured. The Lawrence was so completely cut up, that after the action, she was sent to Erie to be dis mantled. Lieutenant YarnelJ, upon whom the"], [181, "BATTiUE, OIF lElEULTE. \u201e 24 ~WjnETW~\u201e"], [182, ""], [183, "161 NAVAL TEMPLE. command of the Lawrence devolved after the commodore left her, refused to quit the deck though several times wounded. Lieutenant Brooke of the marines, and midshipman Saul, were both killed on board the Lawrence. As the surgeon of this vessel was stooping, in the act of dressing or examining a wound, a ball passed through the ship a few inches from his head, which, had it been erect must have been taken off. Mr. Hambleton, purser, distinguished himself, and towards the close of the action was severely wounded. On board the Niagara, lieutenants Smith and Ed wards and midshipman Webster behaved in a very handsome manner. Captain Brevoort of the army, who, Avith the men under his command, had volun teered, to act as marines, did great execution Avith his musketry. Lieutenant Turner, who command ed the Caledonia, brought his vessel into action in the most gallant style. The Ariel, lieutenant Packet, and Scorpion, sailing master Champlin, got early into the action, and were of great service. The purser Magrath performed essential service. Cap tain Elliot particularly distinguished himself by his exertion and skill. The following is an estimate of the killed and wounded on board the American fleet. Killed. Wounded. Total.

For a long time previous to the war, the British had been actively employed in equipping vessels of war on lake Ontario. On the 19th of July, 1812, soon after the declaration of Avar reach ed Sackett's harbour, lieutenant Woolsey, of the American brig Oneida, then lying in Sackett's har bour, discovered from the mast head five sail of British armed vessels, namely, the Royal George, of twenty-four guns; the Prince Regent, a new * Clark's Naval History, vol. i. p. 217 \u2014 222."], [185, "163 NAVAL TEMPLE. ship carrying upwards of tAventy guns, the Earl Moira of twenty, the Seneca of eight, the other unknown. They were about five leagues distant, beating up for the harbour with the wind ahead. The troops were immediately called to arms and despatches sent for the troops in the vicinty, who assembled, to the amount of nearly three thousand. Soon after sunrise the Prince Regent brought td, and captured the custom house boat, about seven miles from the harbour. The creAv of the boat were set on shore, Avith a message to colonel Belle yer, the commandant at the harbour, demanding the surrender of the Oneida, and the late British schooner Nelson, seized for a breach of the revenue laws, and then fitting out as an armed vessel. In case of refusal, the British threatened to burn the village, and lay the inhabitants under contribution. Soon after this lieutenant, Woolsey left the har bour in the Oneida, and ran down within a league of the British. But he soon returned, and moored his vessel in a line with a land battery lately erect ed. Lieutenant Woolsey then left his vessel, in order to direct the guns of the land battery. By this time the British fleet had arrived Avithin gun shot. The Royal George, as flag ship, was ahead. A brisk firing commenced on both sides, and con tinued upwards of two hours. The Royal George and Prince Regent Avere much injured. As the former Avas v-eering to give a broadside, a shot from an American thirty-two pounder, Avas observed to strike her and completely rake her. Soon after"], [186, "164 NAVAL TEMPLE. this the squadron bore away for Kingston. None of the Americans were injured. On the 31st of July, the Julia, carrying three guns, was attacked by the British armed vessels Earl Moira, of sixteen guns, and the Duke of Glou cester of ten, at the entrance of the St. Lawrence, and beat them both off. In September, captain Isaac Chauncey Avas ap pointed to command the American fleet on lake Ontario, then lying in Sackett's harbour, Avhere he arrived in tli2 month of October. In the early part of November, he sailed with his fleet from Sackett's harbour: the aggregate of guns of the American vessels amounted to forty, their crews to four hun dred and thirty men ; that of the British to one hundred and eight guns, and their crews to eight hundred and ninety men. On the 8th, commodore Chauncey fell in with the Royal George, and chased her into Q,uinte Bay ; where he lost sight of her in the night ; but on the ~ CT \u25a0* morning of the 9th, she Avas perceived lying in Kingston channel. She Avas immediately followed into the harbour of Kingston. He there engaged her, while exposed to the fire of the land batteries, for upwards of an hour and a quarter. Night coming on, he haled off with the intention of renew ing the attack next morning ; but this the weather prevented. On the 10th, the commodore fell in with the Governor Simcoe, Avhich however succeeded in escaping into the harbour of Kingston, In passing"], [187, "165 NAVAL TEMPLE. through the bay of Q,uinte, two British trading ves sels were captured. On the 12th he returned to Sackett's harbour. On the 26th of November, the ship Madison was launched at Sackett's harbour. In the spring of the year 1813, the United States had the following vessels equipped on lake Ontario. Guns. Ship Madison 24 Brig Oneida 18 Schooner Governor Tompkins 6 Hamilton 9 Julia 2 Elizabeth 2 Lady of the Lake 3 Conquest 8 Growler 5 Pert 3 Fair American 4 Ontario 1 Scourge 8 93 Also the Mary, bombvessel. During the sum mer the General Pike of thirty-two guns, Avas added to the fleet. The British fleet in the spring consisted of the following vessels :"], [188, "166 NAVAL TEMPLE Guiia. The frigate General Wolfe 36 Ship Royal George 22 Prince Regent 16 Brig Earl Moira 12 Seven schooners of from four to eight guns each. On the 25th of April the American fleet, under commodore Chauncey, left Sackett's harbour for the purpose of conveying the expedition, under the command of major general Dearborn, against the British post at York. At this place the fleet ar rived on the 27th. The landing of the troops Avas covered in a masterly manner by the commodore. The Americans succeeded in their attack upon the town ; but unfortunately, the ever to be lamented brigadier general Pike, was killed by explosion. A midshipman and some seamen of the fleet were killed. Commodore Chauncey, after having returned to Sackett's harbour from York, again sailed, on the 22d of May, for the purpose of co-operating in the reduction of the British fort George, which was attacked on the 28th. The vessels of the American squadron Avere judiciously stationed to cover the landing of the troops, and to silence the land bat teries of the British ; in the latter they soon suc ceeded; Avhen a landing was effected, and the fort taken. Captain Perry had come down from lake Erie, and Avas in this engagement. He rendered particu lar service to the commodore by assisting in arrang-"], [189, "167 NAVAL TEMPLE. ing and superintending the debarkation of the troops. On board the fleet only one man was killed, and two wounded. On the- 29th of May, during the absence of the American fleet, the British fleet, consisting of the \"\u2022 CT Wolfe, Royal George, Prince Regent, Earl Moira, two armed schooners, and a number, of gun boats, with a detachment of the British army, from Kings ton, attacked Sackett's harbour ; they Avere how ever gallantly repulsed by the troops under the command of brigadier general Brown, A few days after this affair the American fleet returned to Sackett's harbour. In the latter part of July, commodore Chauncey left Sackett's harbour with his fleet, and on the 27th of the same month arrived off Niagara. Having there taken about two hundred and fifty infantry on board, he set sail. It had been resolved to attack an encampment of the British ; but the latter being in greater force than had been supposed, the attempt was abandoned ; and the fleet proceeded to York, where the marines and soldiers were landed, under colonel Scott. A very considerable quantity of British stores were either destroyed or conveyed on board the fleet. The barracks and publick store houses were burnt. The fleet then returned to Niagara. On the 7th of August at daylight, the British fleet, consisting of tAvo ships, two brigs, and two large schooners, were discovered bearing w. n. w. Thev were about five or six miles distant, and the"], [190, "168 NAVAL TEMPLE. wind at west. Commodore Chauncey, having pass ed the leeward of the British line, and abreast of their van ship, the Wolfe, hoisted American colours ; and fired a few guns to ascertain Avhether the British vessels could be reached by his shot. But discover ing that they fell short, he wore and haled upon a Avind on the starboard tack. The rearmost of the American schooners was then about six miles astern. The British wore in succession ; and haled upon a wind on the same tack ; but perceiving the Ameri cans would be enabled to weather them upon the next tack, they tacked, and made all sail to the northward. As soon as the rear vessels of the American squadron could reach the wake of the British, they tacked, and made all sail in chase. In the afternoon, the Avind became very light, and towards night a calm succeeded. The American schooners used their sweeps all the afternoon, in endeavours to close Avith the British, but without success. Late in the afternoon commodore Chaun cey made the signal of recall, and formed in close order. During the night, the wind was from the westward ; and after midnight squally. All hands were kept at quarters, and the vessels beat to Avind ward, in expectation of gaining the wind of the British. During the night the two best American schooners were upset, in a heavy squall of wind, and sunk. Only sixteen person Avere saved from them ; all the rest perished. The names of the schooners were the Hamilton and Scourge, mount ing together nineteen guns. This accident gave"], [191, "169 NAVAL TEMPLE. the British a decided superiority. Commodore Chauncey expected the British would take advan tage of this superiority ; and the more so as by a change of Avind they were brought right to wind ward of him. He accordingly formed his line upon the larboard tack, and hove to. Soon after the British bore up and set studding sails, apparent ly with the intention of bringing the Americans to action. When they had approached within four miles, they brought to on the starboard tack. The Americans then wore, and brought to, on the same tack. Commodore Chauncey perceiving the Brit ish did not intend bringing him to action, edged away towards the shore, in order to take advantage of the land breeze in the afternoon. It soon after became calm, when he directed his schooners to sweep up and erigage the British. About noon a light breeze bleAv from the eastward. The commo dore then took the Oneida in tow, and made sail towards the British. When the van of the Ameri can schooners was within one and a half or two miles of the rear of the British, the wind shifted to the westward, which again brought the latter to windward; when they bore up to the American schooners in order to cut them off, before they could be rejoined by commodore Chauncey. But the schooners succeeded in returning to their sta tion. The British being thus foiled in their attempt upon the schooners, haled their wind, and hove to. The weather becoming very squally, commodore Chauncey resolved to run in towards Niagara. 22"], [192, "170 NAVAL TEMPLE. The crews of the squadron Avere nearly forty-eight hours at quarters. A detachment of one hundred and fifty soldiers was received on board the Ameri can fleet from Niagara, to act as marines. On the fol lowing morning the British fleet was discovered bear ing north. The American commodore immediately Aveighed anchor, and stood for them. The winds were light and variable, and by twelve o'clock Avere quite calm. At five, a fresh breeze blew from the north ; the British fleet then bearing north, about four or five leagues distant. The vessels of the American fleet wore in succession, and haled upon a wind on the larboard tack. At sunset, the British bore n. w. by n. on the starboard tack. The wind changing towards the Avestward, the American com modore stood to the northward all night in order to gain the north shore. At daybreak he tacked to the Avestward, the Avind having then changed to n. n. w. Soon after which he discovered the British fleet, bearing s. w. The commodore made all sail in chase Avith the Asp, Madison, and Fair American in tow. To his great disappointment, the Avind about twelve o'clock changed to av. s. w. Avhich again brought the British to Avindward. The com modore tacked to the northward ; but at three o'clock, the Avind inclining to the north, he wore to south and Avest, and made signal for the fleet to make all sail. At four, the British bore s. s. w. The Americans steered after them. At five, the former were becalmed under the land, while the latter neared them very fast with a fine breeze from"], [193, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 171 N. N. av. At six, the Americans formed in line Avithin four miles of the British ; the wind being then very light. At seven, the wind changed to s. w. and bleAv a fresh breeze. This placed the Brit ish to windAvard. The American commodore then tacked, and haled upon a wind on the larboard tack, under easy sail, the British standing after him. At nine in the evening, the British Avere within double gun shot of the rear of the Americans. They then wore to the southward. Commodore Chauncey stood to the north under easy sail, with his fleet formed in two lines : a part of the schooners formed the Aveather line. They were ordered to commence the fire upon the British, as soon as the shot of the latter should take effect ; and, as they approached, to edge down upon the American line to leeward, pass through the intervals, and form to leeAvard. At half past ten, the British tacked, and stood after the Americans. At eleven o'clock the rear of the American line opened a brisk fire upon the British, and in the course of fifteen minutes the fire became general along the weather line of the Americans. At half past eleven this line bore up, and passed to leeAvard, except the GroAvler and Julia. These tAvo vessels tacked to the south, which brought the Brit ish between them and their commodore. The lat ter filled his main-topsail, and edged away tAvo points to lead the British doAvn ; this he did in order to engage them to greater advantage, and to lead them from the GroAvler and Julia. They however kept their Avind until they separated these tAA'o last"], [194, "172 NAVAL TEMPLE. mentioned vessels from the rest of the American squadron. As they passed the General Pike, a feAV shots Avere exchanged without doing any injury. While the British were in chase of the two schoon ers, the commodore tacked and stood aster them until midnight, when he Avas forced to give over the pursuit to rejoin his squadron, then to leeward. Their line Avas now formed on the starboard tack. The firing continued between the two American CT schooners and the British fleet until one o'clock, when the former Avere captured. Soon after this, the American fleet being nearly destitute of provi sions, returned to Sackett's harbour. During a cruise in the early part of September, commodore Chauncey fell in with the British fleet, and chased them all round the lake, when they put into Amherst bay, after having received considera ble injury from the fire of the Americans. This bay Avas so little knoAvn to the American pilots, that they were unwilling to take the fleet in. Sir James Yeo, commander of the British fleet, had a superiority over the American commodore, both in guns and men. His vessel also sailed better than the American. Commodore Chauncey blockaded the British fleet in Amherst bay for four days, when the Avind blowing heavy from the Avestward, they succeeded in getting into Kingston : upon Avhich the com modore returned to Sackett's harbour, where he remained only a feAv hours, and on the 18th of September sailed for Niagara, where he arrived on the 24th."], [195, "173 NAVAL TEMPLE. Commodore Chauncey having ascertained that the British squadron was in York bay, sailed from Niagara. On the 27th, in the evening, owing to the extreme darkness of the night a part of his squadron separated, and did not join him until next morning. On the same day, the British fleet was discovered^ under way in York bay. The Ameri can squadron sailed for them with three schooners in tow. But on the British perceiving the design of the Americans to engage them, they tacked, and stood out of the bay, the wind being then at east. The American commodore formed his line, and ran down for their centre. As soon, however, as he had approached Avithin three miles, they made all sail to the southward. The vessels of the American squadron wore in succession, and stood on the same tack with the British, and edged down gradually in order to close. At ten, past meridian, the British perceiving the Americans closing fast with them, and that they must either risk an action, or suffer their two rear vessels to be cut off, they tacked in succession, beginning at the van, hoisted then colours, and commenced a well directed fire at the Pike. This they did with a view to cover their rear ; and, while passing to leeward, to attack the rear of the Americans. This commodore Chaun cey frustrated by bearing up in succession, with the line preserved, for the centre of the British, as soon as their leading ship, the Wolfe, had passed the centre of her line, and was abeam of the American. This man\u0153uvre not only covered the American"], [196, "174 NAVAL TEMPLE. rear, but also threw the British in confusion. They immediately bore away; but the Americans had closed so near as to be enabled to bring their guns to bear with effect, and in twenty minutes after, the main and mizzen-topmast, and the main yard of the British frigate Wolfe, was shot away. This vessel immediately put before the wind, with all sail set upon her foremast. The American commodore made signal for the fleet to crowd all sail in pursuit: but as the Wolfe kept right before the wind, she was enabled to outsail the American squadron, and experienced no retardment from the loss of her main and mizzen-topmast. The Americans con tinued the chase until near three o'clock. The Pike, with the Asp in tow, kept within point blank shot of the British during the chase, and sustained the Avhole of their fire. Prudence forbade any fur ther pursuit on the part of the Americans. The Pike Avas much injured, OAving to her being so long exposed to the fire of the whole British fleet. The most serious injury, however, she received from the bursting of a gun, which killed and wounded twenty-two men. The Governor Tompkins lost her foremast. The American fleet returned to Niagara. On the 2d of October, commodore Chauncey again proceeded in quest of the British fleet. He discovered them steering a course for Niagara, with studding sails, and all sails set, the Avind being from the south and Avestward. The commodore made all <ail in chase, but as soon as his vessels Avere dis-"], [197, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 175 covered by the British, they took in studding sails and haled upon a wind to the Avestward, and made all sail from the Americans. The wind being light all day, little progress was made against the current. By sundown, the British were off Twenty Mile Creek, and had got a considerable distance from the Americans. At daylight, the British were perceived at anchor ; but as soon as they saw the American squadron, they weighed and made all sail to the west. The wind was from south to southwest and squally. The American commodore made all sail in chase, and continued it the whole day. At sun down, the British could scarcely be perceived from the mast head of the American vessels. On the fol lowing morning the British fleet was out of sight. Commodore Chauncey then steered for the Ducks, with a view of intercepting the British fleet on its return, should it have gone down the lake. The wind increased to a strong gale from the northward and westward, and continued during the whole day. At three o'clock in the afternoon of the 5th, seven sail were discovered near the False Ducks. Sail was immediately made in chase by the American commodore, who took them for the British fleet. But in the course of an hour he ascertained them to be sloops and schooners. Signal was made by the commodore for the Sylph and Lady of the Lake to cast off the vessels they had in tow, and chase n. e. Soon after this the British were perceived separating on different tacks. The Governor Tompkins Avas now cast off by the Pike, and the commodore made"], [198, "176 NAVAL TEMPLE. all sail in chase with her, having left the American squadron in charge of captain Crane. At five o'clock in the afternoon the British set fire to one of their gun vessels that did not sail well after hav ing taken out her people. At sundown, and oppo site the Real Ducks, the Hamilton, Constance,* and Mary-Ann, struck to the Americans. The Sylph soon after captured the Drummond. The Lady Gore ran into the Ducks, but the Sylph being left to watch her, she was captured early the next morning. The only British vessel that escaped was the Enterprize, a small schooner. The British vessels captured were gun vessels mounting from one to three guns each. They were transporting troops to Kingston. The number of prisoners amounted to two hundred and sixty-four, of whom two hundred and twenty-tAvo were soldiers.

During the summer of the year 1812, prepara tions were made on lake Champlain to oppose the naval force that might be sent by the British from Isle-au-Noix. Nothing very interesting occurred until the 3d of June, 1813. In consequence of some British gun boats having appeared on the American side of the line, the Growler and Eagle sailed from Plattsburgh on the 2d of June, under the command of lieuten ant Smith, with the intention of attacking them. At dark on the same day, they arrived within a mile of the boundary line. On the following morning, at daybreak, three British gun boats were discovered, to which the American vessels immediately gave chase. But the wind being south, they unfortu nately ran so far into the narroAv channel, that they found it difficult to return. The Eagle not being sufficiently strong for her Aveight of metal, became unmanageable, and sunk in shoal water : her crew were however saved. The Growler continued en gaged with a number of British gun boats until the Eade went down, when she was compelled to yield to a superior force; the action continued above four hours. The shores were lined with British soldiers, who from the narroAvness of the channel were enabled to do considerable execution. 23"], [200, "178 NAVAL TEMPLE. About the commencement of August the British in two large sloops of war, three gun boats, and about forty batteaux full of troops crossed the line.

Sir, \u2014 I have the honour to give you the particu lars of the action Avhich took place on the 11th instant on this lake. For several days the enemy were on their way to Plattsburgh by land and water; and it being well understood that an attack would be made at the same time by their land and naval forces, I de termined to await at anchor the approach of the latter. At eight, a. m. the look-out boat announced the approach of the enemy. At nine he anchored in a line ahead, at about three hundred yards distance from my line ; his ship opposed to the Saratoga, his brig to the Eagle, captain Robert Henley, his gal leys (thirteen in number) to the schooner, sloop, and a division of our galleys. Our remaining gal leys with the Saratoga and Eagle. In this situation, -the whole force on both sides became engaged ; the Saratoga suffered much from the heavy fire of the Constance : I could perceive, at the same time, however, that our fire was very destructive to her. The Ticonderoga, lieutenant commandant Cassin, gallantly sustained her full share of the action. At half past ten o'clock, the Eagle, not being able to bring her guns to bear, cut her cable and anchored in a more eligible posi tion, between my ship and the Ticonderoga, where"], [204, "180 NAVAL TEMPLE. she very much annoyed the enemy, but unfortu nately leaving me exposed to a galling fire from the enemy's brig. Our guns, on the starboard side,' being nearly all dismounted, or not manageable, a stern anchor Avas let go, the bower cable cut, and the ship Avinded Avith a fresh broadside on the enemy's ship, which soon after surrendered. Our broadside Avas then sprung to bear on the brig, AAhich surrendered in about fifteen minutes after. \u2022 The sloop that was opposed to the Eagle, had struck some time before, and drifted down the line ; the sloop Avhich Avas with their galleys having struck also. Three of their galleys are said to be sunk, and the others pulled off. Our galleys Avere about obeying with alacrity the signal to follow them, Avhen all the vessels were reported to me to be in a sinking state : it then became necessary to annul the signal to the galleys, and order their men to the pumps. I could only look at the enemy's galleys going off In a shattered condition, for there was not a mast in either squadron that could stand to make sail on ; the lower rigging, being nearly all shot away, hung down as though it had been just placed over the mast heads. The Saratoga had fiftv-five round shot in her CT \u2022> hull; the Confiance one hundred and five.

The British officers taken were captain Pring and six or eight lieutenants. The wounded were paroled and sent by a flag to the Isle-au-Noix. The British large ship proved to be a very fine vessel of her class, having two gun decks in her bow and stern, and mounting, among her guns, twenty eight long twenty-four pounders, a battery which few frigates of the British navy can boast. On the 13th of September, the interment of the American and British officers, who fell in the memo rable battle of the 11th, took place at Plattsburgh, in a manner to do honour to the bravery Avith which they defended their respective flags.

One proved to be the ship Pursuit, captain Chivers, of four hundred and fifty tons, sixteen guns, and thirty-five men. The other was the ship Planter, captain Frith, of two hundred and eighty tons, twelve guns, and fifteen men. The cargoes of both were very valuable. 24"], [210, "186 NAVAL TEMPLE. The Atlas had two men killed and five wounded, and her rigging and sails much injured. She ar rived safe in port with the Pursuit ; the Planter was recaptured off the capes of Delaware. THE YOUNG EAGLE Of New York, of one gun and forty-two men, engaged the British armed ship Granada, of eleven guns and thirty men, and another armed vessel in company with her. After an action of an hour and a half, the Young Eagle succeeded in capturing them both. THE MONTGOMERY, Captain Upton, of Boston, mounting twelve guns, on the 6th of December, 1812, off Surinam, fell in with the British vessel of war Surinam, of twenty guns. They lay board and board for half an hour. Some of the privateer's men lashed the bobstay of the Surinam to the Montgomery's main mast. So spirited was the resistance on both sides, that neither could succeed in boarding. One of the Montgomery's eighteen pounders was repeatedly discharged into the bows of her antagonist between Avind and water. As soon as the tAvo vessels parted,"], [211, "187 NAVAL TEMPLE. the Surinam made sail from the Montgomery. Her foremast was shot away, and she was otherwise so much disabled, as to be compelled to put into an outport to refit, without proceeding to the common place of rendezvous at Barbadoes. THE DOLPHIN Of Baltimore, of ten guns and sixty men, in the latter part of the year, engaged two British armed vessels at the same time, the one of sixteen guns and forty men, and the other of ten guns and twenty five men. She captured them both. THE ROLLA Of Baltimore, of nineteen guns, captured seven vessels in one cruise, the guns of which amounted to fifty-eight, and the prisoners to one hundred and fifty.

One of these last, having lost her mizzenmast, could not keep up Avith the rest of the convoy. As soon as they were out of sight, the Hazard pursued her, to Avhich, after some resistance, she struck. She proved to be the Albion, of London, copper-bottomed, and of three hundred tons burden, navigated by fifteen men, and mounting twelve guns. While the Hazard Avas lying off Charleston, in a fog, her prize was separated from her, and recaptur ed by a British cutter, the Caledonia, of eight guns and thirty-eight men. Three days after, on the 22d of February, the Hazard discovered her prize in company Avith the above-mentioned British cut ter. The Hazard commenced a pursuit of them both. As soon as the Hazard came within musket shot, she commenced firing at the ship and cutter, which was returned by them with spirit, and appa rent determination. At three o'clock, the second lieutenant, carpenter, and five men of the Hazard, were severely wounded. At five, the cutter hauled off to repair the damages she had sustained. At half past five, the Hazard came close to the cutter, the creAv of the former, having determined to lose their lives sooner than give up so valuable a prize. At half past six the British cutter again hauled off, and continued to fire at a distance. Taking advan tage of this, the Hazard bore down on the prize, and after a brisk fire caused her to strike her colours. She was then ordered to lie to."], [213, "189 NAVAL TEMPLE. The British cutter having shot ahead, Le Chartier instantly gave chase, keeping up a brisk fire. He pursued her until eight o'clock. The cutter then ceased firing, and hailed, saying she had struck, and signified the same by hoisting and loAvering a lan tern three times. The Hazard having then but twenty-one men, including the captain, on hoard, it was not thought advisable to take possession of her- She bore down for the prize, of Avhich she took pos session, leaving a prize-master and six men on board of her, so that there only remained fourteen men on board of the Hazard. Both the Hazard and her prize arrived safe at St. Mary's. THE COMET Of Baltimore, captain Boyle, of twelve guns and one hundred and twenty men, being on a cruise, discovered, on the 14th of January, 1813, four sail standing out of Pernambuco. She lay by to give them an opportunity of getting off shore, with a view of then cutting them off. At three p. m. they were upon a wind standing s. e. and about six leagues from land. The Comet bore up, and made sail in chase. At six, one of them was discovered to be a large man of war brig. All hands were immediately called to quarters on board the Comet ; the guns were loaded with round and grape shot ; and the ship cleared for action. At seven, being"], [214, "190 NAVAL TEMPLE. close to the chase, she hoisted her colours, and came close to the man of war brig, which had hoisted Portuguese colours. The commander hailed, and sent an officer on board the Comet, who informed captain Boyle, that the brig was a Portuguese na tional vessel, mounting twenty thirty-two pounders and one hundred and sixty-five men ; that the three others were strongly armed English vessels ; and that he must not molest them. Captain Boyle in formed him that he certainly should make use of every exertion to capture them. The Portuguese said he Avas ordered to protect them, and certainly should. The English vessels Avere ahead of the Comet. They consisted of a ship of fourteen guns, and two brigs of ten guns each. So that including the Por tuguese vessel, the Comet had a force of fifty-four guns -to oppose. Captain Boyle immediately made sail for them ; came up with the ship, hailed her, and ordered the captain to have the mainsail back ed. He gave little or no ansAver. The Comet hav ing shot ahead, captain Boyle informed him, that he should be along in a few minutes, when if he did not obey his orders, he Avould pour a broadside into the ship. In a few minutes the Comet tacked, the Portuguese sloop of Avar being close after her, and ran along side of the ship, one of the brigs being close to her. The Comet opened a broadside on them both. It Avas now about half past eight p. M. All the vessels Avere carrying a press of sail. The Comet, from her superior sailing, was frequently"], [215, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 191 obliged to tack. From this she Avould have profited very much, had not the Portuguese sloop of war been so close. The latter now opened a heavy fire on the Comet, with round and grape shot, which she returned. The Comet had noAV the whole force of the four vessels to contend with. She, however, kept as closely as possible to the English vessels. They frequently separated, to give the sloop of Avar an opportunity of firing into the Comet. The latter as frequently poured Avhole broadsides into them ; at times also into the sloop of war. About eleven p. m. the ship surrendered \u2014 she was cut to pieces, and rendered unmanageable. Soon after the brig Bowes struck \u2014 she also was much injured. A boat was sent to take possession of her ; as it passed the sloop of war, a broadside was fired by her, which nearly sunk it, and obliged it to return. The Comet then commenced a brisk fire at the sloop of war, which sheered off to some distance. After following her a short distance, she obliged the third English vessel to strike. The latter was very much cut to pieces. The Comet now again proceeded to take possession of the Bowes, when she spoke the ship that had first sur rendered \u2014 her captain being ordered to folloAv, informed captain Boyle that his ship Avas in a sink ing condition, having many shot holes between* wind and water, and every rope on board of her being cut away. At half past one, a. m. the BoAves Avas taken possession of and manned. The sloop of war"], [216, "192 NAVAL TEMPLE. then fired a broadside into the prize, and passed her. The moon was now down, and it became quite dark and squally. This caused the Comet to separate from the other vessels, excepting the sloop of Avar, with which broadsides were frequently ex changed. At two, she stood to the south. Captain Boyle noAV thought it most prudent to take care of one of the prizes until daylight, the other two being out of sight. At daybreak, the sloop of war, and the two other prizes, a ship and brig, Avere discover ed. The Comet immediately hove about, and stood for them. The sloop tacked, and made signals for her convoy to make for the first port. Captain Boyle, knowing the situation of the ship and brig, determined not to take possession of them, but to Avatch their man\u0153uvres. Great exertions appeared to be made to keep them from sinking. Captain Boyle was afterwards informed that the sloop of Avar Avas much injured \u2014 she had five men killed, and a number wounded. The ship's mast scarcely lasted to carry her into Pernambuco. Her cargo was nearly all damaged. It was with diffi culty the brig was kept from sinking before she reached Pernambuco harbour. After capturing the Aberdeen, of eight guns, two vessels of ten guns each, in sight of a sloop of war, and a schooner, captain Boyle returned to the Unit ed States. He passed the blockading squadron in she Chesapeake, and arrived safe at Baltimore."], [217, "193 NAVAL TEMPLE. THE GENERAL ARMSTRONG, A schooner of eighteen guns, commanded by captain Champlin, Avas cruising off Surinam, on the 11th March, 1813. At seven a. m. she discovered a sail, which at half past eight, fired three guns, and hoisted English colours. About nine, the Arm strong fired a gun, and hoisted American colours. At half after nine, the British vessel tacked, and stood as near the Armstrong as the wind would per mit, keeping up a brisk fire from her main deck guns. At half past ten, the Armstrong bore down, intending to pour her starboard broadside into her, then Avear ship, discharge the larboard broadside, and then board. This Avas done, except the board ing. The English vessel was noAV discovered to be a frigate, pierced for twenty-four guns. She kept up a constant fire on the Armstrong, which lay for ten minutes like a log. The fore-top-sail and miz zen-gaff halyards of the frigate were shot away. This brought down her colours. The creAV of the Armstrong, thinking she had struck, ceased firing. But they were soon again seen flying, and the ac tion was reneAved. The frigate lay for a few minutes apparently unmanageable. She soon, however, re covered, and opened a heavy fire from her starboard broadside and main-top ; apparently with the inten tion of sinking the Armstrong. The latter lay for the space of forty-five minutes within pistol shot of the frigate. Captain Champlin was standing by the 25"], [218, "194 NAVAL TEMPLE. centre gun, in the act of firing his pistol, when he was wounded by a musket ball from the main top of the frigate. The Armstrong luffed to windward, and forereached the frigate. The Armstrong had six men killed, and sixteen Avounded, and was very much injured in her rigging, masts, and hull \u2014 she, however, succeeded in es caping from the frigate. THE YOUNG TEAZER, Captain Dobson, of New York, was chased into Halifax by the Sir John Sherbroke, a vessel of superior force. When within the light house she hoisted English colours over the American, and was chased nearly up to the forts, when the Sir John Sherbroke supposing her to be a prize, hove about, and put to sea. As soon as the latter was out of sight, the Young Teazer hauled doAvn her English colours, and effected her escape. THE DECATUR, Of Charleston, mounting seven guns, with a crew of one hundred and three men, and commanded by captain Diron, being on a cruise in the month of August, discovered a ship and schooner. She im mediately stood towards them to reconnoitre. At"], [219, "195 NAVAL TEMPLE. half past twelve, the Decatur was abreast of the schooner, which hoisted English colours. At one the Decatur wore round ; and half an hour after the schooner fired a shot Avithout effect. The cap tain of the Decatur immediately gave orders to pre pare for action. At two o'clock the schooner fired another shot, which passed over the Decatur. At a quarter past two, the latter fired her large gun, and hoisted American colours at the peak : two more discharges were made from the same piece, which were answered by two guns from the British schooner. The two vessels Avere noAV within half gun shot distance. Captain Diron, observing that the schooner was preparing to bear away, hauled upon the larboard tack, in order to present the bow of his vessel to his antagonist. Soon aftenvards the latter fired her Avhole broadside, Avhich only slightly damaged the Decatur's rigging. This was returned from the eighteen pounder of the Decatur. Her captain, at the same time, ordered every one of the crew to his post, in order to carry the British vessel by boarding, as soon as the necessary prepa rations for the purpose should be made. It was now three quarters of an hour past two, and the vessels were within pistol shot of each other. A severe fire of musketry commenced from the Deca tur. The British schooner bore away to prevent being boarded ; and fired a broadside into the De catur, which killed two of her men, and injured her rio-aino- and sails. The Decatur closely followed her antagonist in her man\u0153uvres, and again endea-"], [220, "196 NAVAL TEMPLE. voured to board, Avhich the schooner once more avoided, and fired another broadside. A third at tempt Avas made by the captain of the Decatur to board. The jib-boom of the Decatur was run into the mainsail of the schooner, and the latter not being able to disengage herself, dropped along side. Dur ing this man\u0153uvre the fire from the cannon and musketry on both sides Avas extremely severe and destructive. While the tAvo vessels lay in this po sition captain Diron ordered his Avhole crew, armed Avith pistols, sabres, &c. to board, Avhich was per formed with the greatest promptness. The resis tance of the English was desperate. Fire arms soon became useless, and the contest Avas carried on Avith the cutlass. The captain and principal officers of the British A^essel being killed, and her deck covered Avith dead and Avounded, her colours Avere hauled down by the crew of the Decatur, when the two vessels wTere separated, having their rigging and sails cut to pieces. The English vessel was his Britannick majesty's schooner Dominica, of fifteen guns, with a creAv of eighty-eight men. The Decatur had four men killed and sixteen Avounded ; the Dominica thirteen killed and forty-seven wounded. Among the killed of the Dominica was her brave commander, who, as long as he lived, refused to surrender his vessel, and declared his determination not to survive her loss. The king's packet Princess Charlotte, remained an inactive spectator of this bloody contest, which lasted an hour. As soon as the vessels were disen-"], [221, "197 NAVAL TEMPLE. gaged, she tacked about and stood to the southward. She had sailed from St. Thomas, under convoy of the Dominica. The Decatur and her prize arrived safe in port. THE SARATOGA, Of four guns and one hundred and sixteen men, belonging to New York, while cruising off Surinam river, in the month of September, discovered the British packet, brig Morgiana, of eighteen guns, with a creAv of about fifty men, commanded by James Cunningham. Captain Aderton, the com mander of the Saratoga, immediately gave chase : when Avithin musket shot, the Morgiana hoisted English colours, and the action commenced : part of the time the A'essels Avere Avithin pistol shot : the remainder, they were close along side of each other. After an action of an hour and a quarter the Saratoga succeeded in capturing the British vessel by boarding. The action Avas extremely severe. Both vessels were almost reduced to wrecks. The Saratoga had almost all her stays, shrouds, &c. cut away. In her mainsail there were upAvards of a hundred shot holes. A number of shot also struck her masts, spars, and hull. The crew of the Mor giana fought Avith desperation. She had Iavo men killed, and eight Avounded. The Saratoga had tAvo men killed and five Avounded. Both arrived safe in port."], [222, "198 NAVAL TEMPLE. THE GENERAL ARMSTRONG. The following letter from John D. Dabney, Esq. American consul at Fayal, (Portugal,) gives the particulars of a flagrant violation of the neutrality of that port, in an attack upon the privateer General Armstrong, by the enemy. The Armstrong belong ed to NeAv York, and mounted eight long nines and a twenty-four pounder. Fayal, October 5, 1814. Sir, \u2014 I have the honour to state to you that a most outrageous violation of the neutrality of this port, in utter contempt of the laws of civilized na tions, has recently been committed here, by the commanders of his Britannick majesty's ships Plan taganet, Rota and Carnation, against the American private armed brig General Armstrong, Samuel C. Reid, commander ; but I have great satisfaction in being able to add, that this occurrence terminated in one of the most brilliant actions on the part of captain Reid, his brave officers and crew, that can be found on naval record. The American brig came to anchor in this port in the afternoon of the 26th of September, and at sunset of the same day, the above named ships sud denly appeared in these roads ; it being nearly calm in the port, Avas rather doubtful if the privateer could escape if she got under Avay, and relying on the justice and good faith of the British captains, it"], [223, "199 NAVAL TEMPLE. was deemed most prudent to remain at anchor. A little after dusk captain Reid seeing some suspicious movements on the part of the British, began to Avarp his vessel close under the guns of the castle, and while doing so, he Avas at about eight o'clock, p. m. approached by four boats from the ships filled with armed men. After hailing them repeatedly and warning them to keep off, he ordered his men to fire upon them and killed and Avounded several men. The boats returned the fire and killed one man and Avounded the first lieutenant of the priva teer, and returned to their ships ; and, as it was noAV light moonlight, it was plainly perceived from the brig as well as from the shore, that a formidable attack was premeditating. Soon after midnight, twelve or more large boats, crowded with men from the ships, and armed with carronades, swivels and blunderbusses, small arms, &e. attacked the brig ; a severe contest ensued Avhich lasted about forty minutes and ended in the total defeat and partial destruction of the boats, with a most unparalleled carnage on the part of the British. It is estimated by good judges that near four hundred men were in the boats when the attack commenced, and no doubt exists in the minds of the numerous spectators of the scene, that more than one half of them Avere killed or wounded ; several boats were destroyed ; two of them remained along side of the brig literally loaded with their oAvn dead. From these two boats only seventeen reached the shore alive ; most of them were severelv wounded. The whole of the"], [224, "200 NAVAL TEMPLE. following day the British were occupied in bury ing their dead ; among them were two lieutenants and one midshipman of the Rota \u2014 the first lieuten ant of the Plantaganet, it is said, cannot survive his Avounds, and many of the seamen who reached their ships Avere mortally wounded and have been dying daily. The British, mortified at this signal and un expected defeat, endeavoured to conceal the extent of the loss ; they admit hoAvever that they lost in killed and who have died since the engagement, up wards of one hundred and twenty of the flower of their officers and men. The captain of the Rota told me he lost seventy men from his ship. Two days after this affair took place the British sloops of war Thais and Calypso came into port, when captain Lloyd immediately took them into requisi tion to carry home the Avounded officers and sea men. They have sailed for England, one on the 2d and the other on the 4th instant each carried twenty-five badly wounded. Those who were slightly wounded, to the number, as I am informed, of about, thirty, remained on board of their respec tive ships, and sailed last evening for Jamaica. Strict orders Avere given that the sloops of war should take no letters whatever to England, and those orders were rigidly adhered to. In face of the testimony of all Fayal, and a num ber of respectable strangers, Avho happened to be in this place at the moment, the British commander endeavours to throw the odium of this transaction on the American captain, Reid, alleging that he sent"], [225, "201 NAVAL TEMPLE. the boats merely to reconnoitre the brig, and with out any hostile intentions ; the pilots of the port did inform them of the privateer the moment they entered the port. To reconnoitre an enemy's ves sel in a friendly port, at night, with four boats, car rying, by the best accounts, one hundred and twenty men, is certainly a strange proceeding ! The fact is, they expected, as the brig was warping in, that the Americans would not be prepared to receive them, and they had hopes of carrying her by a \" coup de main.\" If any thing could add to the baseness of this transaction on the part of the British com mander, it is the want of candour openly and boldly to avoAV the facts. In vain can he expect by such subterfuge to shield himself from the indignation of the world, and the merited resentment of his oavh government and nation for thus trampling on tha sovereignty of their most ancient and faithful ally, and for the wanton sacrifice of British lives. On the part of the Americans the loss Avas com paratively nothing; two killed and seven wounded : of the slain Ave have to lament the loss of the second lieutenant, Mr. Alexander O. Williams, of New York, a brave and meritorious officer. Among the wounded are Messrs. Worth and Johnson, first and third lieutenants ; captain Reid was thus deprived, early in the action, of the services of all his lieutenants; but his cool and intrepid conduct secured him the victory. On the morning of the 27th ult. one of the Brit ish ships placed herself near the shore and com- 26"], [226, "202 NAVAL TEMPLE. menced a heavy cannonade on the privateer. Finding further resistance unavailing, captain Reid ordered her to be abandoned after being partially destroyed, to prevent her falling into the hands of the enemy, who soon after sent their boats and set her on fire. At nine o'clock in the evening (soon after the first attack) I applied to the governour, requesting his excellency to protect the privateer, either by force or by such remonstrance to the commander of the squadron as Avould cause him to desist from any further attempt. The governour indignant at Avhat had passed, but feeling himself totally unable with the slender means he possessed, to resist such a force, took the part of remonstrating, which he did in forcible but respectful terms. His letter to captain Lloyd had no other effect than to produce a menacing reply insulting in the highest degree. Nothing can exceed the indignation of the publick authorities, as well as of all ranks and descriptions of persons here, at this unprovoked enormity. Such was the rage of the British to destroy this vessel, that no regard was paid to the safety of the toAvn ; some of the inhabitants were wounded, and a num ber of houses were much damaged. The strongest representations on this subject are prepared by the governour for his court. Since this affair the commander, captain Lloyd, threatened to send on shore an armed force, and arrest the privateer's crew ; saying, there Avere many Englishmen among them ; and our poor fellows,"], [227, "203 NAVAL TEMPLE. afraid of his vengeance, have fled to the mountains several times, and have been harassed extremely. At length, captain Lloyd, fearful of losing more men if he put his threats in execution, adopted this stratagem : he addressed an official letter to the governour, stating that in the American crew Avere two men who deserted from his squadron in Ameri ca, and as they were guilty of high treason, he re quired them to be found and given up. Accord ingly a force was sent into the country, and the American seamen Avere arrested and brought to town, and as they could not designate the said pre tended deserters, all the seamen here passed an examination of the British officers, but no such per sons were to be found among them. I was request ed by the governour and British consul to attend this humiliating examination, as was also captain Reid ; but we declined to sanction by our presence any such proceedings. Captain Reid has protested against the British commanders of the squadron for the unwarrantable destruction of his vessel in a neutral and friendly port, as also against the government of Portugal for their inability to protect him.

PORTER'S SETTLEMENT AT NOOAHEEVAH- Letter from captain John M. Gamble of the marines, detailing the occurrences which took place at Nooaheevah after the departure of captain Porter, and his subsequent capture by the Cherub. New York, August, 1815. Sir, \u2014 I have the honour to inform you, that on the 12th of December, 1813, the day on which the Essex frigate, and Essex junior, took their depar ture from Nooaheevah, I Avas left in port Anna Maria bay, with eighteen men under my command, and six prisoners of war, in charge of the establish ment on shore, together with the prize ships Green- Avich, Seringapatam, and Sir Andrew Hammond, Avith orders from captain Porter to remain five and a half calendar months at that place \u2014 at the expiration of which time, should he not return, or send me further instructions how to act, I was, if possible, to man two of the ships, and after taking every article of value out of the other, and burning that ship, to repair to the port of Valparaiso \u2014 where, in the event of my not finding the frigate or additional orders, I was authorized to dispose of one of the ships to the best advantage, taking on board the other all the men under my charge, as well as the prize-crews of the different ships then in that port, and proceed to the United States."], [229, "205 NAVAL TEMPLE. After receiving those instructions, my first object was, agreeably to the wish of captain Porter, to fill the ship New Zealander with oil from the other ships ; and on the 28th of the same month she took her departure for the LTnited States, with a cargo of nineteen hundred and fifty barrels, and well found in every respect for so long a voyage. With regret, sir, I have to inform you, the fri gate had not got clear of the Marquesas, before we discovered in the natives a hostile disposition to wards us, and in a few days they became so insolent, that I found it absolutely necessary, not only for the security of the ships and property on shore, but for our personal safety, to land my men and regain by force of arms the many articles they had in the most daring manner stolen from the encampment ; and what was of still greater importance, to prevent, if possible, their putting threats into execution, Avhich might have been attended with the most serious consequences on our part, from duty re quiring my men to be so much separated. I, however, had the satisfaction to accomplish my wish without firing a musket, and from that time lived in perfect amity with them, until the 7th May following, when my distressed situation placed me in their power. Before mentioning the lamentable events of that day, and the two succeeding ones, I shall give you a brief account of a few preceding occurrences Avhich Avere sources of great uneasiness to me. The first was the death of John Witter (a faithful"], [230, "206 NAVAL TEMPLE. old marine) who was unfortunately drowned in the surf on the afternoon of the 28th of February, and the desertion of four of my men ; the one Isaac Coffin (black man) had deserted from the Essex the day before she sailed out of the bay, and was then a prisoner for attempting the second time to make his escape from the ships. They took the advantage of a dark night, and left the bay in a whale-boat, unobserved by any person, all, except ing the prisoner, having the watch on deck. They took with them several muskets, a supply of ammu nition, and many things of but little value. My at tempt to pursue them Avas prevented, by their destroying, in a great measure, the only remaining boat at that time seaworthy. On the 1 2th April began to rig the ships Seringa patam,and Sir Andrew Hammond, Avhich, as I calcu lated, employed the men until the 1st of May. All hands were then engaged in getting the remainder of the property from the Greenwich to the Seringa patam, as I began to despair of the frigate rejoining me at that place. The Avork went on well, and the men were obe dient to my orders, though I discovered an evident change in their countenances, which led me to sup pose there Avas something wrong in agitation, and under that impression had all the muskets, ammuni tion, and small arms of every description taken to the Greemvich (the ship 1 lived on board of) from the other ships, as a necessary precaution against a surprise from my own men."], [231, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 207 On the 7th of May, while on board the Seringa patam on duty which required my being present, I was suddenly and violently attacked by the men employed in that ship. After struggling a short time, and receiving many bruises, I was throAvn down on the deck, and my hands and legs im mediately tied. They then threw me on the second deck, thence dragged me into the cabin, and confined me to the run, where in a feAv mi nutes midshipman Feltus, and acting midshipman Clapp were thrown in, tied in the same manner as1 myself: the scuttle was then nailed down and a sentinel placed over it. After spiking all the guns of the Greenwich, and of the fort, and those of the Sir Andrew Hammond that were loaded, plundering the ships of every thing valuable, \u2014 committing many wanton depreda tions on shore, taking all the arms and ammunition from the Greenwich ; sending for Robert White, the man who was sent out of the Essex for mutinous conduct, and bending the necessary sails, they stood out of the bay, with a light wind off the land. My fellow prisoners, and shortly after myself, Avere then taken out of the run, and placed in the cabin, under the immediate charge of several sentinels. Shortly aster getting clear of the bay, one of the sentinels, though he had been repeatedly cautioned against putting his finger on the trigger, fired a pis tol, the contents of which passed through my heel a little below the ankle bone."], [232, "208 NAVAL TEMPLE. I had not received the wound a moment before the men on deck pointed their muskets doAvn the sky-light, and were in the act of firing, when the sentinel prevented them by saying the pistol was accidentally discharged. At nine o'clock, the night dark, and the wind bloAving fresh, after receiving by request from the mutineers a barrel of powder, and three old mus kets, I Avas put in a leaky boat, where I found my unfortunate companions. In that situation, after rowing at least six miles, and every person exhausted from the great exer tion made to prevent the boat from sinking, we reached Greenwich, where I found my few remain ing men anxiously looking out for me, and seriously alarmed at the conduct of the savages. They had already begun to plunder the encampment, and were informed by Wilson (a man who had lived among them for several years, and who, as I after wards learnt, was not only instrumental to the mutiny, but had in my absence plundered the Sir Andrew Hammond) of our defenceless situation. Finding it impossible to comply with that part of my instructions directing me to remain in the bay until the 27th May \u2014 I thought it most advisable to repair to the port of Valparaiso; and with that view every soul, assisted by George Ross, and Wil liam Brudewell, (traders living on the island for the purpose of collecting sandal wood,) exerted them selves in making the necessary preparations to depart."], [233, "209 NAVAL TEMPLE. My first object was to put the Sir Andrew Ham mond in a situation that we might get under way at any moment. That done, all hands Avere engaged in getting the feAv articles of value from shore, and endeavouring to recover the stolen property from the Sir Andrew Hammond, when the savages made an unprovoked and wanton attack upon us, in which I have, with the deepest regret, to inform you, mid shipman William Feltus, John Thomas, Thomas Gibbs, and William Brudewell were massacred, and Peter Caddington (marine) dangerously wounded ; but he made his escape together with William Worth, by swimming some distance, when they were taken out of the water by midshipman Clapp and the only three men left. Our situation at that moment was most desperate \u2014 the savages put off in every direction with a view to intercept the boat, and board the ship, but were driven back by my firing the few guns we had just before loaded with grape and cannister shot. Before the boat return ed, and the guns were reloaded, they made the second attempt, and afterwards repeated attempts, first to board the Sir AndreAV Hammond, and then the Greenwich \u2014 but were repulsed by our keeping up a constant firing. During this time several hun dred were employed in pulling down the houses, and plundering the encampment, while others were in the fort, endeavourmg (assisted by Wilson Avho had received several casks of powder from the mutineers) to get the spikes out of the guns. 27"], [234, "210 NAVAL TEMPLE. As soon as William Worth had recovered a little strength after being so long in the water, I sent the boat to the Greenwich, for John Pitlenger (a sick man) and some things that were indispensably ne cessary, and Avith orders to burn that ship, and return Avith all possible despatch, as our ammunition Avas nearly all expended, and we had no other means of keeping the savages one moment out of the ship. We then bent the jib and spanker, cut the moor ings, and luckily had a light breeze that carried us clear of the bay, with six cartridges only remain- ing. It was then we found our situation most dis tressing. In attempting to run the boat up, it broke in two parts, and we were compelled to cut away from the bows our only anchor, not being able to cat it. We mustered altogether eight souls \u2014 out of which there was one cripple confined to his bed, one man dangerously Avounded, one sick, one con valescent, a feeble old man just recovering from the scurvy, and myself unable to lend any further as sistance, the exertions of the day having so greatly inflamed my wound as to produce a violent fever, \u2014 leaving midshipman Clapp, and two men only capa ble of doing duty. In that state, destitute of charts and of every means of getting to windward, I saw but one alternative, to run the trade winds down, and if possible make the Sandwich islands, in hopes of either falling in Avith some of the Canton ships, (that being their principal place of rendezvous) or"], [235, "211 NAVAL TEMPLE. of obtaining some assistance from Tamaahmaah, the king of the Windward Islands. No time was lost in bending the topsails, and on the 10th of May we took our departure from Ro berts island. On the 25th of the same month made Owhyhee, and on the 30th after suffering much, came to an anchor in Whytetee bay, at the island of Whoohoo, where I found captain Winship, several officers of ships, and a number of men, from whom (particularly captain Winship) I received every assistance their situation could afford me. The natives, though at first surprised at our de plorable condition, and inquisitive to know the cause of it, which I did not think prudent to inform them, supplied the ship with fresh meat, fruits and vegetables, partly on condition that I would take the chief men of the island, and some others with their property up to the WindAvard Islands, (where I found it necessary to go,) after shipping some men, in order to procure a supply of salt provisions from the king. From thence it was my intention to have proceeded to Valparaiso in compliance with my instructions from captain Porter, \u2014 but I was unfor tunately captured on the passage by the English ship Cherub of twenty guns. I Avas someAvhat suprised to hear captain Tucker say (when I pointed out a valuable canoe, and many other articles which I as sured him Avas the property of the natives, and that I was merely conveying them, and it, from the one island to the other, the Aveather being too boisterous at that time for them to make the passage in their"], [236, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 212 canoes,) that every thing found in a prize-ship be longed to the captors. So that I had the mortification to see the people from Avhom I had received so much kindness, sent on shore, deprived of all they had been collecting for tAvelve months past, and were about to present to their king as a tribute imposed upon them. The Cherub then proceeued to Atooi, where after capturing the ship Charon, and making many fruitless attempts to get the cargo of that ship, and of several others that had been deposited on the island, under the immediate protection of the king of the Leeward Islands, she took her departure on the 15th of July from that place, and on the 28th November following, arrived at Rio de Janeiro with her prizes, touching on her passage for refresh ments at Otaheite and at Valparaiso. During her stay at the latter place, the frigates Briton and Tagus arrived from the Marquesas, where they had been in search of the ships left under my charge. On the 1 5th of December the prisoners were sent on shore, having received the moss rigorous treat ment from captain Tucker, during their long con finement in his ship, and the greater part of them, like the natives, left destitute of every thing, save the clothes on their backs. The men belonging to the Essex had but little to lose, but those I shipped at Waahoo had received in part, money and goods for one, two, and some of them three years servi\u0153s in the Canton ships."], [237, "Naval temple. 213 On the 1 5th of May, by the advice of a physician who attended me, I took my departure from Rio de Janeiro, in a Swedish ship bound to Havre de Grace, leaving behind acting midshipman Benjamin Clapp, and five men, having lost one soon after my arrival at that place with the small pox. No opportunity had previously offered by which I could possibly get from thence, the English ad miral on that station, being determined to prevent by every means in his power American prisoners from returning to their own country. On the 10th instant, in latitude forty-seven de grees north, and in longitude eighteen degrees west I took passage on board the ship Oliver Ellsworth (captain Roberts) fifteen days from Havre de Grace, bound to New York.

Immediately aster the ratification of peace with Great Britain, in February 1815, Congress, in con sequence of the hostile conduct of the regency of Algiers, declared war against that poAver. A squad ron Avas immediately fitted out, under the command of commodore Decatur, consisting of the Guerriere, Constellation, and Macedonian frigates, the Ontario and Epervier sloops of war, and the schooners Spark, Spitfire, Torch, and Flambeau. Another squadron, under commodore Bainbridge, was to folloAv this armament, on the arrival of which, it was understood, commodore Decatur would return to the United States in a single vessel, leaving the command of the Avhole combined force to commo dore Bainbridge. The force under commodore Decatur rendez voused at New York, from which port they sailed the 20th day of May, 1815, and arrived in the bay of Gibraltar in twenty-five days, after having previous ly communicated with Cadiz and Tangier. In the passage, the Spitfire, Torch, Firefly, and Ontario, separated at different times from the squadron in gales, but all joined again at Gibraltar, with the"], [239, "215 NAVAL TEMPLE. exception of the Firefly, which sprung her masts, and put back lo NeAv York to refit. Having learn ed at Gibraltar that the Algerine squadron, which had been out into the Atlantick, had undoubtedly passed up the straits, and that information of the arrival of the American force had been sent to Al giers by persons in Gibraltar, commodore Decatur determined to proceed Avithout delay, up the Medi terranean, in the hope of intercepting the enemy before he could return to Algiers, or gain a neutral port. The 17th of June, off Cape de Gatt, he fell in with and captured the Algerine frigate Mazouda, in a running fight of twenty-five minutes. After two broadsides the Algerines ran beloAv. The Guerriere had four men wounded by musketry \u2014 the Algerines about thirty killed, according to the statement of the prisoners, who amounted to four hundred and six. In this affair the famous Algerine admiral, or Rais, Hammida, Avho had long been the terror of this sea, was cut in two by a cannon shot. On the 19th of June, off cape Palos, the squadron fell in with and captured an Algerine brig of tAven ty-two guns. The brig was chased close to the shore, where she was followed by the Epervier, Spark, Torch, and Spitfire, to Avhom she surrender ed, after losing twenty-three men. No Americans Avere either killed or wounded. The captured brig, Avith most of the prisoners on board, was sent into Carthagena, Avhere she has since been claimed by the Spanish government under the plea of a"], [240, "216 NAVAL TEMPLE. breach of neutrality. As this affair will probably become a subject of negotiation between the Unit ed States and Spain, Ave decline entering into fur ther particulars. From cape Palos, the American squadron pro ceeded to Algiers, where it arrived the 28th of June. Aware that a despatch-boat had been sent from Gibraltar, to inform the regency of his arrival, and having also learned that several Tartans had gone in search of the Algerines, to communicate the news, commodore Decatur concluded that their fleet was by this time safe in some neutral port. He therefore thought it a favourable time to take advantage of the terror which his sudden and unwelcome arrival had excited, to despatch a letter from the President of the United States to the dey, in order to afford him a fair opportunity to open a negotiation. The captain of the port was immedi ately despatched to the Guerriere, on the receipt of this letter, accompanied by Mr. Norderling the Swedish consul; and commodore Decatur, who, with Mr. Shaler, had been empowered to negotiate a treaty, proposed the basis, on Avhich alone he could consent to enter on the affair of an adjust ment. This Avas the absolute and unqualified relin quishment of any demand of tribute on the part of the regency, on any pretence whatever. To this he demurred. He was then asked if he knew what had become of the Algerine squadron, and replied \u2014 \" By this time it is safe in some neutral port.\" \" Not the Avhole of it,\" was the reply. He was then told"], [241, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 217 of the capture of the frigate, of the brig, and of the death of Hammida. He shook his head, and smiled with a look of incredulity, supposing it a mere at tempt to operate on his fears, and thus induce an acceptance of the proposed basis. But when the lieutenant of Hammida was called in, and the minis ter learned the truth of these particulars, he became completely unnerved, and agreed to negotiate on the proposed basis. He premised, however, that he was not authorized to conclude a treaty, but re quested the American commissioners to state the conditions they had to propose. This was done, and the captain of the port then requested a cessa tion of hostilities, and that the negotiation should be conducted on shore, the minister of marine having pledged himself for their security Avhile there, and their safe return to the ships whenever they pleased. Neither of these propositions were ac cepted, and the captain was expressly given to un derstand, that not only must the negotiation be carried on in the Guerriere, but that hostilities would still be prosecuted against all vessels belong ing to Algiers, until the treaty was signed by the dey. The captain of the port and Mr. Norderling then went on shore, but the next day again came on board, with the information that they were commis sioned by the dey to treat on the basis for Avhich the commissioners of the United States had stipu lated. A treaty was then produced, which the commissioners declared could not be varied in any 28"], [242, "218 NAVAL TEMPLE. material article, and that consequently, discussion was not ordy useless, but dangerous on their part ; for if in the interim the Algerine squadron Avere to appear, it would most assuredly be attacked. On examining the treaty proposed, the captain of the port was extremely anxious to get the article stipu lating for the restoration of the property taken by the Algerines during the Avar dispensed with, ear nestly representing that it had been distributed into many hands, and that as it Avas not the present dey who declared Avar, it was unjust that he should an swer for all its consequences. The article Avas, however, adhered to by the American commission ers, and after various attempts to gain a truce, as Avell as to gain time, it Avas at length settled that all hostilities should instantly cease, when a boat was seen coming off with a white flag, the Swedish con sul pledging at the same time his honour, that it should not be hoisted until the dey had signed the treaty, and the prisoners were safe in the boat. The captain and Mr. Norderling then went on shore, and returned within three hours ; Avith the treaty signed, together with all the prisoners, al though the distance was more than five miles. The principal articles in this treaty were, that no tribute under any pretext or in any form whatever, should ever be required by Algiers from the United States of America \u2014 that all Americans in slavery should be given up Avithout ransom \u2014 that compensation should be made for American vessels captured, or property seized or detained at Algiers \u2014 that the"], [243, "219 NAVAL TEMPLE. persons and property of American citizens found on board an enemy's vessel should be sacred \u2014 that vessels of either party putting into port should be supplied with provisions at market price, and, if ne cessary to be repaired, should land their cargoes without paying duty\u2014 that if a vessel belonging to either party should be cast on shore, she should not be given up to plunder \u2014 or if attacked by an enemy within cannon shot of a fort, should be protected, and no enemy be permitted to follow her when she went to sea within twenty-four hours. In general, the rights of Americans on the ocean and the land, were fully provided for in every instance, and it was particularly stipulated that all citizens of the United States taken in war, should be treated as prisoners of war are treated by other nations, and not as slaves, but held subject to an exchange with out ransom. After concluding this treaty, so highly honourable and advantageous to this country, the commissioners gave up the captured frigate and brig, to their former owners. To this they Avere influ enced by a consideration of the great expense it would require to put them in a condition to be sent to the United States \u2014 the impossibility of dis posing of them in the Mediterranean, and by the pressing instances of the dey himself, Avho earnestly represented that this would be the best method of satisfying his people Avith the treaty just concluded, and consequently the surest guarantee for its ob servance on his part. The policy of the measure we think sufficiently obvious, when it is considered"], [244, "220 NAVAL TEMPLE. that the dey would most likely, in case of their re fusal, have fallen a victim to the indignation of the people, and that, in all probability, his successor would have found his safety only in disowning the peace Avhich had been made by his predecessor. There being, as we before stated, some dispute with the Spanish authorities Avith regard to the legality of the capture of the Algerine brig, it was stipulated on the part of the American commissioners, in order to induce the Spaniards to give her up, that the Spa nish consul and a Spanish merchant, then prisoners in Algiers, should be released, and permitted to re turn to Spain if they pleased. According to the last advices the brig was still detained by the Spa nish government, and the ultimate disposal of this vessel will probably be settled by an amicable ne gotiation. Commodore Decatur despatched captain Lewis in the Epervier, bearing the treaty to the United States, and leaving Mr. Shaler at Algiers, as consul general to the Barbary states, proceeded with the rest of the squadron to Tunis, Avith the exception of two schooners under captain Gamble, sent to convoy the Algerine vessels home from Carthagena. He was prompted to this visit, by having been in formed that a misunderstanding existed between our consul and the bashaw of Tunis, into the nature of which he considered himself bound in duty to inquire. Here he Avas officially informed by the consul of a violation of the treaty subsisting between the United States and the bashaAv, first, in permit-"], [245, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 221 ting two prizes of an American privateer to be taken out of the harbour by a British cruiser, and second ly, in permitting a company of merchants, subjects of Tunis, to take the property of an American citi zen at their own price, and much below its real value. The truth of these allegations being thus officially verified, commodore Decatur addressed a letter to the prime minister of Tunis, demanding satisfaction for these outrages exercised or permitted by the bashaw, and a full restoration of the property thus given up or sacrificed. The bashaw, through the medium of his prime minister, acknowledged the truth of the facts, as well as the justice of the de mands ; but begged twelve months to pay the money. This was refused ; and on receiving as surances that it would be paid forthwith, the com modore went on shore, where he received the visits of the different consuls. The brother of the prime minister of Tunis chanced to arrive with the money at this time, and seeing the British consul in conver sation with commodore Decatur, threw down the bags which contained it with great indignation, at the same time addressing the consul in English, Avhich he spoke fluently, \" You see, sir, what Tunis is obliged to pay for your insolence. You must feel ashamed of the disgrace you have brought upon us. You are very good friends noAV, but I ask you Avhether you think it just first to violate our neutrality, and then to leave us to be destroyed, or pay for your aggressions.\" As soon as the"], [246, "222 NAVAL TEMPLE. money was paid, the bashaw prepared to despatch a minister to England, to demand the amount which he had been obliged to pay in consequence of this requisition of the American commodore. Aster adjusting these differences, the squadron proceeded to Tripoli, Avhere commodore Decatur made a similar demand for a similar violation of the treaty subsisting between the United States and the bashaAv, Avho had permitted two American ves sels to be taken from under the guns of his castle by a British sloop of Avar, and refused protection to an American cruiser lying Avithin his jurisdiction. Restitution of the full ATalue of these vessels was de manded, and the money, amounting to twenty-five thousand dollars, paid by the bashaw into the hands of the American consul. After the conclusion of this affair, the American consular flag, which Mr. Jones, the consul, had struck, in consequence of the violation of neutrality above mentioned, was hoisted in the presence of the foreign agents, and saluted from the castle with thirty-one guns. In addition to the satisfaction thus obtained for unprovoked aggressions, the commodore had the pleasure of ob taining the release of ten captives, tAvo Danes, and eight Neapolitans, the latter of whom he landed at Messina. After touching at Messina and Naples, the squad ron sailed for Carthagena on the 31st of August, where commodore Decatur was in expectation of meeting the relief squadron, under commodore Bainbridge. On joining that officer at Gibraltar,"], [247, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 223 he relinquished his command, and sailed in the Guerriere for the United States, where he arrived on the 12th of November, 1815. Every thing being done previous to the arrival of the second division of the squadron, under commodore Bainbridge, that gallant officer had no opportunity of distin guishing himself, as we are satisfied he always will where occasion occurs. Pursuant to his instruc tions he exhibited this additional force before Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, where they Avere some what surprised at the appearance of the Indepen dence seventy-four, having always been persuaded that the United States were restricted by their treaties with England from building ships of that class. When colonel Lear was consul at Algiers he endeavoured to convince the ministers of the dey that such was not the case ; but they ahvays replied, \" If you are permitted to build seventy fours, let us see one of them and we shall be satis fied.\" Commodore Bainbridge sailed from Gibral tar thirty -six hours before the Guerriere, and ar rived at Boston the 1 5th of November. Thus was concluded an expedition in which, though feAV, perhaps no opportunities occurred for a display of the hardy prowess of our sailors, the nation acquired singular honour, in humbling and chastising a race of lawless pirates, Avho have long been the inveterate scourges of the christian Avorld. Independently of the glory thus accruing to the re publican name, the probable advantages arising from this sudden and unlooked-for appearance of an Ame-"], [248, "224 NAVAL TEMPLE. rican squadron immediately after a war with Great Britain,we think will be manifold. This circumstance Avill give them an idea of the power and resources of the United States altogether different from that which they before entertained ; and serve to con- vince them of the danger of provoking their resent- ment under any expectation of the destruction of their navy by any power whatever. That the as- surance of an immediate war with England was what principally encouraged the dey of Algiers to commence hostilities against the United States, under a conviction that our little navy would speedily be annihilated, is evident from the follow- ing fact. One of the dey's officers one morning insinuated, whether true or false we cannot say, to the British consul at Algiers, that it was his fault that they declared war. \" You told us,\" said he, \" that the American navy would be destroyed in six months by you, and now they make war upon us with two of your own vessels they have taken from you.'\""], [249, "225 NAVAL TEMPLEi HORNET AND PENGUIN. On the 23d of March, 1815, as the Hornet, commanded by captain Biddle, was about to an chor off the north end of the island of Tristan d'Acuna, a sail Avas seen to the southward ; which, at forty minutes past one, hoisted English colours, and fired a gun. The Hornet immediately luffed to, hoisted an ensign, and gave the enemy a broadside. A quick and well directed fire Avas kept up from the Hornet, the enemy gradually drifting nearer, with an intention, as captain Biddle supposed, to board. The enemy's bowsprit came in between the main and mizzen rigging on the starboard side of the Hornet, giving him an oppor tunity to board, if he had wished, but no attempt was made. There was a considerable swell, and as the sea lifted the Hornet ahead, the enemy's bow sprit carried away her mizzen shrouds, stern davits, and spanker booms, and hung upon her larboard quarter. At this moment an officer called out that they had surrendered. Captain Biddle directed the marines to stop firing, and, while asking if they had surrendered, received a Avound in the neck. The enemy just then got clear of the Hornet ; and his foremast and boAVsprit being both gone, and per ceiving preparations to give him another broadside, he again called out that he had surrendered. It was with great, difficulty that captain Biddle could 29"], [250, "226 NAVAL TEMPLE. restrain his crew from firing into him again, as it was certain he had fired into the Hornet after hav ing surrendered. From the firing of the first gun to the last time the enemy cried out that he had surrendered, was exactly twenty-two minutes. The vessel proved to be the British brig Penguin, of twenty guns, a remarkably fine vessel of her class, and one hundred and thirty-two men ; twelve of them supernumeraries from the Medway, seventy four, received on board in consequence of their being ordered to cruise for the privateer Young Wasp. The Penguin had fourteen killed and twenty eight Avounded. Among the killed was captain Dickenson, Avho fell at the close of the action. As she Avas completely riddled, and so crippled as to be incapable of being secured, and being at a great dis tance from the United States, captain Biddle order ed her to be scuttled and sunk. The Hornet did not receive a single round shot in her hull ; and though much cut in her sails and rigging, was soon made ready for further service. Her loss was one killed and eleven Avounded. ESCAPE OF THE HORNET. On the 28th April, 1815, the Hornet Avas chased by a British seventy-four, and was compelled to throw over her guns, shot, spars, &c. She escaped,"], [251, "227 NAVAL TEMPLE. and put into St. Salvador. On his arrival at that port, captain Biddle received information of the peace between the United States and Great Britain. On the return of captain Biddle to the United States a naval court of inquiry was held by order of the secretary of the navy, on board the Hornet, in the harbour of New York, on the 23d of August, 1815, to investigate the causes of the return of that ship into port, and to inquire into the circumstances attending the loss of armament, stores, &c, during her cruise ; and the following opinion has been pro nounced by the court : The court, after mature deliberation on the testi mony adduced, are of opinion, that no blame is imputable to captain Biddle, on account of the return of the Hornet into port, with the loss of her armament, stores, &c, and that the greatest applause is due to him for his persevering gallantry and nau tical skill, evinced in escaping, under the most dis advantageous circumstances, after a long and ardu ous chase by a British line-of-battle ship.

On the 31st of August 1314, the advance of the British army under general Brisbane, entered Champlain, and encamped on the north side of the Great Chazy river, and on the same day major general Mooers ordered out the militia of the counties of Clinton and Es sex. The regiment from Clinton county, under lieutenant-colonel Miller, immediately assembled, and on the 2d September took a position on the west road near the village of Chazy ; and on the 3d general Wright with such of his brigade as had arrived, occupied a position on the same road about eight miles in advance of Platts burgh. On the 4th the enemy having brought up his main body to Champlain, took up his line of march for that place. The rifle corps under lieutenant-colonel Appling, on the lake road, fell back as far as Dead Creek, blocking up the road in such manner as to impede the advance of the enemy as much as possible. The enemy advanced on the 5th within a few miles of lieutenant-colonel Ap pling's position, and finding it too strong to attack, halted and caused a road to be made west into the Beekmantown road, in which the light brigade under general Powers advanced, and on the morning of the 6th, about seven o'clock, attacked the militia, which had at this time increased to nearly seven hundred, under general Mooers, and a small detachment of regulars under major Wooi, about seven miles from Plattsburgh. Aster the Ijrst sire, a considerable part of the militia broke and fled in every direction. Many, however, manfully stood their ground, and, with the small corps of major Wool, bravely contested the ground, against five times their number, falling back gradually and occupying the fences on each side the road, till they arrived within a mile of the town, when they were reinforced by two pieces of artillery, under cap tain Leonard, and our troops occupying a strong position behind a stone wall, for some time stopped the progress of the enemy: being at length compelled to retire, they contested every inch of ground until they reached the south bonk of the Saranac, where the enemy"], [272, "246 APPENDIX. attempted to pursue them but was repulsed with loss. The loss of the British in this skirmish was colonel Wellington and a lieutenant of the third Buffs, and two lieutenants of the fifty -eighth killed, and one captain and one lieutenant of the fifty-eighth light company wounded, together with about one hundred privates killed and wounded ; while that on our part did not exceed twenty -five. The coips of riflemen under colonel Appling, and detachment under captain Sproul, fell back from their position at Dead Creek in time to join the militia, &c. just before they entered the village, and fought with their accustomed bravery. The British got possession of that part of the village north of the Saranac about eleven o'clock, but the incessant and well directed fire of our artillery and mus- ketry from the forts and opposite bank compelled them to retire. before night beyond the reach of our guns. The enemy arrived towards night with his heavy artillery and baggage on the lake road and crossed the beach, where he met with a warm reception from our row-galleys, and it is believed suffered a heavy loss in killed and wounded. On our side, lieutenant Duncan, of the navy, lost an arm by a rocket and three or four men were killed by the enemy's artillery. The enemy encamped on the ridge west of the town, his right near the river, and occupying an extent of nearly three miles, his left resting on the lake about a mile north of the village. From the 6th, until the morning of the 1 1th, an al- most continual skirmishing was kept up between the enemy's pick- ets and our militia stationed on the river ; and in the mean time both armies were busily engaged \u2014 ours in strengthening the works of the forts, and that of the enemy in erecting batteries, collecting ladders, bringing up his heavy ordnance, and making other prepa- rations for attacking the fort. On the morning of the 7th, a body of the enemy under captain Noadie, attempted to cross at the upper bridge, about seven miles west of Plattsburgh, but were met by captain Vaughan's company of about twenty -five men, and compelled to retire with the loss of two killed and several wounded. On the morning of the 11th, the enemy's fleet came round the head with a light breeze from the north, and attacked ours, which lay at anchor in Cumberland bay, two miles from the shore, east of the fort. The action was long and bloody, but decisive ; and the event such as we believe it will always be (except by accident) when our navy contends with any thing like an equal force. The enemy commenced a simultaneous bombardment of our works from seven batteries, from which several hundred shells and rockets were dis- charged, which did us very little injury, and our artillery had nearly succeeded in silencing all before the contest on the lake was decided. The enemy attempted at the same time to throw his main body in rear of the fort, by crossing the river three miles \u2022west oi the town, near the scite of Pike's cantonment. He sue-"], [273, "247 APPENDIX. seeded in crossing, after a brave resistance by the Essex militia and a few of the Vermont volunteers, in all about three hundred and fifty, stationed at that place, who retired back a mile and a half from the river, continually pouring in upon them an incessant fire from behind every tree, until lieutenant Sumpter brought up a piece of artillery to their support, when the enemy commenced a precipitate retreat. The Vermont volunteers, who had hastened to the scene of action on the first alarm, fell upon the enemy's left flank and succeeded in making many prisoners, including three officers. Had the British remained on the south side of the river thirty minutes longer, they must have lost nearly the whole detach ment that crossed. Our loss in this affair was five killed and eight or ten wounded, some mortally. Immediately on ascertaining the loss of the fleet, Sir George Prevost ordered preparations to be made for the retreat of the army, and set off himself with a small escort, for Canada, a little after noon. The main body of the enemy, with the artillery and baggage, were taken off in the afternoon and night, and the rear guard, consisting of the light brigade, started at daybreak, and made a precipitate retreat, leaving their wounded and a large quantity of provision, fixed ammunition, shot, shells and other publick stores in the different places of deposit about their camp. They were pursued some distance by our troops, and many prisoners taken ; but owing to the very heavy and incessant rain, we were compelled to return. The enemy lost, upon land, more than two thousand men in killed, wounded, prison ers and deserters; while our aggregate loss did not exceed one hundred and fifty.* ATTACK ON BALTIMORE. On Saturday the 10th of September, information was received that the enemy was ascending the Chesapeake, and on Sunday morning his ships were seen at the mouth of the Patapsco river, (which communicates with the basin on which Baltimore stands) in number from forty to fifty. Some of his vessels entered the river, while others proceeded to North Point, (at the mouth of the Pa tapsco,) fourteen miles from Baltimore, and commenced the de barkation of their troops in the night, which was finished early next morning. The following extracts of a letter from general Smith to the secretary of war, give an account of the events which followed : * Sketches of the War, p. 405\u2014407."], [274, "248 APPENDIX. \"Baltimore, September 19, 1814, \" I have the honour of stating, that the enemy landed between seven and eight thousand men on Monday the 10th instant, at North Point, fourteen miles distant from this town. Anticipating this debarkation, general Strieker had been detached on Sunday evening with a portion of his brigade on the North Point road. Major Randal, of the Baltimore county militia, having under his command a light corps of riflemen and musketry taken from general Stanbury's brigade and Pennsylvania volunteers, was detached to the mouth of Bear Creek, with orders to co-operate with general Strieker, and to check any landing which the enemy might attempt in that quarter. On Monday, brigadier general Strieker took a good posi tion at the junction of the two roads leading from this place to North Point, having his right flanked by Bear Creek, and his left by a marsh. He here awaited the approach of the enemy, having sent on an advance corps under the command of major Heath of the 5th regiment. This advance was met by that of the enemy, and after some skirmishing it returned to the line, the main body of the enemy being at a short distance in the rear of their advance. Between two and three o'clock, the enemy's whole force came up and commenced battle by some discharges of rockets, which were succeeded by the cannon from both sides, and soon after the action became general along the line. General Strieker gallantly main tained his ground against a great superiority of numbers during the space of an hour and twenty minutes, wben the regiment on his left (the fifty-first) giving way, he was under the necessity of re tiring lo the ground in his rear, where he had stationed one regi ment as a reserve. He here formed his brigade ; but the enemy not thinking it advisable to pursue, he, in compliance with previous arrangements, fell back and took post on the left of my intrench ments, and a half mile in advance of them. \" In this affair the citizen soldiers of Baltimore, with the excep tion of the fifty-first regiment, have maintained the reputation they so deservedly acquired at Bladensburg, and have given their coun try and their city an assurance of what may be expected from them when their services are again required. I cannot dismiss the subject without expressing the heartfelt satisfaction I experience in thus bearing testimony to the courage and good conduct of my fel low townsmen. About the time general Strieker had taken the ground just mentioned, he was joined by brigadier general Winder, who had been stationed on the west side of the city, but was now ordered to march with general Douglass' brigade of Virginia militia and the United States dragoons under captain Bird, and take post on the left of general Strieker. During these movements, the \"brigades of generals Stansbury and Foreman, the seamen and ma-"], [275, "249 APPENDIX. rines under commodore Rodgers, the Pennsylvania volunteers under colonels Cobeau and Findley, the Baltimore artillery under colonel Harris, and the marine artillery under captain Stiles, manned the trenches and the batteries \u2014 all prepared to receive the enemy. We remained in this situation during the night. \" On Tuesday, the enemy appeared in front of my intrench ments, at the distance of two miles, on the Philadelphia road, from whence he had a full view of our position. He man\u0153uvred during the morning towards our left, as if with the intention of making a circuitous march, and coming down on the Hartford and York roads. Generals Winder and Strieker were ordered to adapt their movements to those of the enemy, so as to baffle this supposed in tention. They executed this order with great skill and judgment; by taking an advantageous position, stretching from my left across the country, when the enemy was likely to approach the quarter he seemed to threaten. This movement induced the enemy to concentrate his forces (between one and two o'clock) in my front, pushing his advance to within a mile of us, driving in our videttes, and showing an intention of attacking us that evening. I imme diately drew generals Winder and Strieker nearer to the left of my intrenchments, and to the right of the enemy, with the intention of their falling on his right or rear, should he attack me ; or if he de clined it, of attacking him in the morning. To this movement and to the strength of my defences, which the enemy had the fairest opportunity of observing, I am induced to attribute his retreat, which commenced at half past one o'clock on Wednesday morn ing. In this he was so savoured by the extreme darkness and a continued rain, that we did not discover it until daylight. I con sented to general Winder's pursuing with the Virginia brigade and the United States dragoons ; at the same time major Randal was despatched with his light corps in pursuit of the enemy's right, whilst the whole of the militia cavalry was put in motion for the same object. All the troops were, however, so worn out with continued watching, and with being under arms during three days and nights, exposed the greater part of the time to very inclement weather, that it was found impracticable to do any thing more than pick up a few stragglers. The enemy commenced his embarkation that evening, and completed it the next day at one o'clock. It would have been impossible, even had our troops been in a condition to act offensively, to have cut off any part of the enemy's rear guard during the embarkation, as the point where it was effected was defended from our approach by a line of defences extending from Back River to Humphrey's Creek on the Patapsco. thrown up by oirrselves previous to their arrival. 32"], [276, "250 APPENDIX. \" I have now the pleasure of calling your attention to the bravt commander of fort M'Henry,* major Armstead, and to the opera tions confined to that quarter. The enemy made his approach by water at the same time that his army was advancing on the land, and commenced a discharge of bombs and rockets at the fort as soon as he got within range of it. The situation of major Arm stead was peculiarly trying \u2014 the enemy having taken his position at such a distance as to render offensive operations on the part of the fort entirely fruitless, while their bombs and rockets were every moment falling in and about it \u2014 the officers and men being at the same time entirely exposed. The vessels, however, had the temerity to approach somewhat nearer \u2014 they were as soon com pelled to withdraw. During the night, whilst the enemy on land was retreating, and whilst the bombardment was the most severe, two or three rocket vessels and barges succeeded in getting up the Ferry Branch ; but they were soon compelled to retire, by the forts in that quarter, commanded by lieutenant Newcomb of the navy, and lieutenant Webster of the flotilla. These forts also des troyed one of the barges, with all on board. The barges and bat tery at the Lazaretto, under the command of lieutenant Rutter of the flotilla, kept up a brisk and it is believed a successful fire dur ing the hottest period of the bombardment. The loss in fort M'Henry was four killed and twenty-four wounded, amongst the former I have to lament the fall of lieutenants Clagett and Clamm, who were both estimable citizens and useful officers. \" Of general Strieker's brigade, the number of killed and wound ed amounts to about one hundred and fifty \u2014 among the former this city has to regret the loss of its representative in the state legisla ture, James Lowry Donaldson, esquire, adjutant of the twenty seventh regiment. This gentleman will ever be remembered by his constituents for his zeal and talents, and by his corps for his bravery and military knowledge. \" I cannot conclude this report without informing you of the great aid I have derived from commodore Rodgers. He was ever present and ever ready to afford his useful counsel, and to render his im portant services. His presence, with that of his gallant officers and seamen, gave confidence to every one. \" The enemy's loss, in his attempt ost Badtimore, amounts, as near as we can ascertain, to between six and seven hundred killed, wounded and missing.\" * Fort M'Henry is about two miles from the city of Baltimore."], [277, "251 APPENDIX. BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS. On the 27th December, general Jackson arrived at New Orleans with his army, where he immediately began the inspection of the different forts and works down the Mississippi river. On the morning of the 1st of January, the enemy had advanced within six hundred yards of our breast-works, under cover of night and a heavy fog, and erected three different batteries, mounting in all fifteen guns, from 6's to 32's. About eight o'clock, when the fog cleared off, they commenced a most tremendous fire, which was amply return ed by our men, and a heavy cannonading was kept up, without the least interval on either side, except that occasioned by the explo sion of two small magazines, owing to their congreve rockets. At four o'clock, p. m. we had dismounted all their guns but two. During the night the enemy retreated to their strong holds, about a mile and a quarter from our lines. Our loss was eleven killed and twenty-three wounded : that of the enemy must have been much more. A 32 pounder from a battery commanded by commodore Patterson, killed fifteen at one shot. The Louisiana this day fired seven hundred shot. On the 2d of January, general Jackson received at New Orleans and its vicinity, reinforcements from Kentucky and Tennessee, amounting to three or four thousand, which, with his former force, gave him an army of between seven and eight thousand, of whom not more, however, than one half were armed. In consequence of the great number of men arriving with their arms in bad order, and of the scarcity of good muskets with bayonets, four companies of United States troops gave up theirs, amounting to about five hundred, to arm the men at the camp, and armed themselves with fowling pieces and pikes. On the 6th of January, sailing-master Johnson of the United States navy, with a launch and three small boats, manned with thirty-eight men, succeeded in burning a British transport brig on Lake Borgne, and in capturing a number of prisoners. The brig was laden with provisions and clothing. On the same day, twenty one sail of British vessels arrived off Cat island, upon the coast opposite the bay of St. Louis, with large reinforcements of troops, commanded by general Lambert. On the 7th, these troops were disembarked at the bayou Bienvenu : and lieutenant-general sir Edward Pakenham, (brother-in-law of lord Wellington) assumed command of the whole British army, amounting to twelve thousand men."], [278, "252 APPENDIX. For two or three days previous to this, part of the forces of the enemy had been employed in preparing scaling ladders and collect- ing fascines (made of sugar canes) for their intended assault upon our lines ; while others were widening and deepening the canal which leads from the bayou Bienvenu toward the Mississippi, and which, on the evening of the 7th, was cut through to admit the river. Through this canal they floated or dragged twenty-four of their smaller boats, containing twenty-five men each, and thus transported about six hundred men to the opposite side of the river. Some distance above the spot where they landed, two batteries had been constructed and placed under the direction of commodore Patterson. The enemy's troops which had thus crossed, were intended to at- tack the commodore's batteries and create a diversion on that side of the river, while the main attack was carried on on the other side. Accordingly on the morning of the 8th, they silently drew out a large force to storm our lines, their columns advancing unper- ceived in the obscurity of the morning, to within about half a mile of our camp, where they1 met and drove in our piquet guard. About day-break they advanced with great vivacity to the intrenchment, led gallantly on by their officers ; when the intrepid Jackson and his brave men opened a most tremendous and deadly fire upon them from our works, which ended in a dreadful slaughter and total defeat of the enemy. General Jackson officially reports to the \u25a0secretary at war an account of this battle in the following words : \u2014 Camp, 4 miles below Orleans, January 9, 1815. Sir, \u2014 During the days of the 6th and 7th, the enemy had been actively employed in making preparations for an attack on my lines. With infinite labour they had succeeded on the night of the 7th in getting their boats across from the lake to the river, by widen ing and deepening the canal on which they had effected their dis embarkation. It had not been in my power to impede these opera tions by a general attack ; added to other reasons, the nature of the troops under my command, mostly militia, rendered it too hazardous to attempt extensive offensive movements in an open country, against a numerous and well disciplined army. Although my forces, as to number, had been increased by the arrival of the Kentucky division, my strength had received very little addition ; a small portion only of that detachment being provided with arms. Compelled thus to wait the attack of the enemy, I took every measure to repel it when it should be made, and to defeat the object he had in view. General Morgan with the Orleans contingent, the Louisiana militia and a strong detachment of the Kentucky troops, occupied an in trenched camp on the opposite side of the river, protected by"], [279, "253 APPENDIX. strong batteries on the bank, erected and superintended by com modore Patterson. In my encampment every thing was ready for action, when, early on the morning of the 8th, the enemy after throwing a heavy shower of bombs and congreve rockets, advanced their columns on my right and left, to storm my intrenchments. I cannot speak suf ficiently in praise of the firmness and deliberation with which the whole line received their approach \u2014 more could not have been ex pected from veterans inured to war. \u2014 For an hour, the fire of the small arms was as incessant and severe as can be imagined. The artillery, too, directed by officers who displayed equal skill and courage, did great execution. Yet the columns of the enemy con tinued to advance with a firmness which reflects the greatest credit. Twice the column which approached me on my left, was repulsed by the troops of general Carroll, those of general Coffee, and a divi sion of the Kentucky militia, and twice they formed again and re newed the assault. At length, however, cut to pieces, they fled in confusion from the field, leaving it covered with their dead and wounded. The loss which the enemy sustained on this occasion, cannot be estimated at less than fifteen hundred in killed, wounded and prison ers. Upwards of three hundred have already been delivered over for burial ; and my men are still engaged in picking them up within my lines and carrying them to the point where the enemy are to receive them. \u2014 This is an addition to the dead and wounded whom the enemy have been enabled to carry from the field, during, and since the action, and to those who have since died of the wounds they received. We have taken about five hundred prisoners, up wards of three hundred of whom are wounded, and a great part of them mortally. My loss has not exceeded, and I believe has not amounted to ten killed and as many wounded. The entire destruc tion of the enemy's army was now inevitable, had it not been sol an unfortunate occurrence which at this moment took place on the other side1 of the river. Simultaneously with his advance upon my lines, he had thrown over in his boats a considerable force to the other side of the river. This having landed, was hardly enough to advance against the works of general Morgan ; and, what is strange and difficult to account for, at the very moment when its entire discomfiture was looked for with a confidence approaching to cer tainty, the Kentucky reinforcements, in whom so much reliance had been placed, ingloriously fled, drawing after them by their example, the remainder of the forces ; and thus yielded to the enemy that most fortunate position. The batteries which had rendered me, for many days, the most import service, though bravely de fended, were of course now abandoned ; not, however, until the guns had been spiked."], [280, "254 APPENDIX. This unfortunate route had totally changed the aspect of affairs. The enemy now occupied a position from which they might annoy us without hazard, and by means of which they might have been enabled to defeat, in a great measure, the effects of our success on this side the river. It became therefore an object of the first con sequence to dislodge him as soon as possible. For this object, all the means in my power, which I could with any safety use, were immediately put in preparation. Perhaps, however, it was owing somewhat to another cause that I succeeded even beyond my ex pectations. In negotiating the terms of a teiii)xirary suspension of hostilities to enable the enemy to bury their dead and provide for their wounded, I had required certain propositions to be acceded to as a basis ; among which this was one \u2014 that although hostilities should cease on this side the river until twelve o'clock of this day, yet it was not to be understood that they should cease on the other side ; but that no reinforcements should be sent across by either army until the expiration of that day. His excellency Maj. Gen. Lambert begged time to consider of these propositions until ten o'clock of to-day, and in the meantime recrossed his troops. I need not tell you with how much eagerness I immediately regained pos session of the position he had thus hastily quitted. In a subsequent letter, general Jackson states the loss of the ene my to have been much greater than what he had at first compu ted. Upon information which was believed to be correct, colo nel Haynes reported it to have been in total two thousand six hundred, viz. seven hundred killed, fourteen hundred wounded, and five hundred prisoners, including one major, four captains, eleven lieutenants and one ensign, who were among the latter. The Ame rican loss, on both sides of the Mississippi was thirteen killed, thir ty-nine wounded, and nineteen missing \u2014 total seventy-one. Of this number six were killed and seven wounded in the action on the eastern bank of the river, and the residue in a sortie after the action and in the action on the western bank. Among the British officers killed were Sir Edward Pakenham, lieutenant-general and com mander in chief, (cut asunder by a canon ball) major-general Gibbs, colonel Reyner, majors Pringle, Whitaker and AVilkinson. Among their wounded was major-general Keane, severely. Numerous accounts official as well as unofficial, represent this battle to have been the greatest ever fought on the American con tinent. For disparity of loss a parallel can scarcely be found in ancient or modem history. So determined were the enemy to carry our works, that many came up to the very muzzles of our guns, and some penetrated into our lines, where they were either killed or taken prisoners. Many fell mounting the breast-works ; other-"], [281, "255 APPENDIX. were slain upon the works; and the ditch in front was, in many places, literally filled with dead and wounded. The roar of artil- lery from our lines was incessant, while an unintermitted rolling fire was kept up from our muskets. The atmosphere was filled with sheets of fire and volumes of smoke. For an hour and a quarter the enemy obstinately continued the assault ; fresh men constantly ar- riving to fill up their lines thinned by our sire. Their determined perseverance and steady valour, were worthy of a better cause ; nor did their troops falter, until almost all the officers who had led them to the attack had fallen. At one time, a body of the enemy succeeded in gaining possession of a bastion on our right with three pieces of canon in it ; but so destructive was our fire, that every man who entered was either killed by our riflemen or disabled be- fore thy could spike the guns. Our men soon returned to the charge and regained the bastion. So intent were the enemy in getting over our works, that they pulled off their shoes for the purpose of climb- ing them ; but nearly all who made the attempt were either killed or taken prisoners. The guns of commodore Patterson's batteries, on the opposite side of the river, did great execution, until the retreat of the Ken- tucky troops, who had been posted near them. The commodore, finding himself thus deserted, was compelled, with a handful of brave men, to retire, after spiking his guns. The British afterwards burnt the gun carriages, being foiled in their expectations of using the guns to annoy our troops on the opposite shore. Previous to the battle of the 8th of January, the pirates of Ba- rataria, who had been held in custody, were released by order ol general Jackson, upon condition that they would assist in defend- ing the city of New-Orleans. In the battle of that day they prov ed themselves excellent artillerists, and were, together witli a few Frenchmen, successfully employed in serving the pieces. They were afterwards released from any further confinement, having re ceived (at the ,-equest of the general assembly of Louisiana) a full pardon from the president of the United States. Soon after the battle, the enemy sent in a flag of truce, and twenty-four hours were allowed them to remove and bury their dead. In one small spot alone, on the left of our lines, they found three hundred and sixty-eight dead bodies. In the course of the day forty carts and ten boats arrived at New-Orleans, loaded with wounded prisoners, who were put into the barracks, which were converted into temporary hospitals ; about one hundred and fifty unwounded prisoners were also put in confinement. \u2014 To the wound ed every attention was paid by the citizens ; the nuns of the con vent took the glorious lead. They, under the immediate superin- tendance of the Abbe Douburg, threw open their doors and convert-"], [282, "256 APPENDIX. ed all their houses, separated from their main building, into a hos pital, where they themselves, at their own expense, and with their own hands, took care of the sick and wounded. The ladies of New-Orleans were also employed in the same charitable acts ot benevolence, as likewise in making clothes for our soldiers. The future historian will delight to contrast the destroying and brilliant virtues of the one sex, with the preserving and not less attracting virtues of the other. Immediately after their repulse, the enemy commenced active operations for a re-embarkation of their troops. Nearly the vvhole. of the sick and wounded were sent on board their vessels, together with such baggage and munitions of war as could be safely spared. During these operations, the enemy kept up a menacing attitude \u2014 frequent indications were given of an intention to renew the attack on our lines, and vigorous works of defence were thrown up in front of our camp. The rear of their army retired first, while they dis played a numerous body of men to the view of our troops, and at night their fires seemed rather to increase than diminish. They had erected batteries to cover their retreat, in advantageous positions, from their original encampment, to the bayou through which they entered lake fiorgne. The cannon placed on these batteries could have raked a pursuing army in every direction, and any attempt to storm them would have been attended with very great slaughter. Having made the necessary arrangements, the whole British army precipitately retreated on the night of the 18th of January ; an ac count of which was officially given by general Jackson to the sec retary of war. The enemy's loss after decampment, and on ship-board, (includ ing about three hundred drowned while passing to and from their shipping,) amount to four thousand eight hundred.* The American loss in the several engagements, was fifty -five kill ed, one hundred and eighty -five wounded, and ninety-three missing \u2014 total, three hundred and thirty-three. Of our forces actually engaged (including marines as well as land troops) the following is a correct statement : \u2014 In the action of the 28th of December, three thousand two hundred and eighty-two ; 1st of January, three thou sand nine hundred and sixty-one ; 8th of January, four thousand six hundred and ninety-eight. The enemy's force previous to the 6th of January, was nine thousand ; after that time it was increased to twelve thousand. * A number of Britidi deserters and prisoners have stated their loss to have exceeded live Oiousand ; and it is worthy of remark, that the British official account of the action of the 8th of January represents it as very considerably surpassing the statement given by general Jackson."], [283, "257 APPENDIX. CRUISE OF THE PRESIDENT. On the 18th February, 1814, commodore Rodgers arrived at Sandy Hook in the United States frigate President from a cruise in the course of which she passed most of the West India Islands. After being off Charleston two days she was chased by a seventy four, two frigates, and several sloops of war. She had captured and sunk three British merchantmen, and taken on board thirty prisoners. One occurrence that took place during this cruise is truly de serving of record. Several strange sail were observed, and one large ship to the windward, that proved to be a seventy-sour, which came down within gun shot. Commodore Rodgers had cleared ship for action, and continued with the main top-sail to the mast. After hauling her wind on the larboard tack, the enemy kept her distance, and the President remained three hours with her main top-sail to the mast. As the enemy evinced no disposition to en gage, the President gave her a shot to windward and hoisted colours \u2014 the seventy-four then bore up, and backed main top-sail when she had approached within gun shot. After mustering all hands aft, commodore Rodgers addressed them in a spirited and appropriate manner, and immediately gave orders to wear ship for the engagement. While backing to meet the cutter, and take a pilot on board, the commodore was surprised to observe the enemy standing off to the southward and eastward. A frigate and gun brig appearing in sight, he hauled in main and fore tacks and made for land. For the space of five hours the enemy had it at all times in his power to bring the President to action, and she lay in readiness with main top-sail aback and expecting him. Captain Lloyd who commanded the seventy-four which proved to be the Plantagenet, states that his crew was in a state of mutiny. and gives this as a reason for declining an engagement with thr President. 33"], [284, "258 APPENDIX. ESCAPE OF THE CONSTITUTION FROM THE TENEDOS AND ENDYMION. On the 3d of April, 1814, the United States frigate Constitution, cap tain Stewart, arrived at Marblehead, having 'been chased in by the British frigates Tenedos and Endymion, of thirty-eight guns each, which had been in chase of her from daylight. The frigates, or one of them, it is said, got within two or three miles of the Con stitution, at one time, and to effect her escape she was obliged to throw overboard her provisions, &c. and every thing moveable, and started all her water. Some prize goods were likewise thrown over. She immediately anchored above fort Sewall, in a posture of de fence, her exposed situation rendering her liable to an attack, should she remain there long. In order to the protection of the frigate and the town, a number of heavy cannon were sent over from Salem, and major general Hovey issued an order for the Mar blehead battalion of artillery to hold itself in readiness to act. Commodore Bainbridge, to whom an express had been sent, des patched assistance from the navy yard in Charlestown, and the company of New England Guards began their march from Boston, to afford such aid as might be required of them. But towards evening the Constitution weighed anchor and came round into Salem harbour.
