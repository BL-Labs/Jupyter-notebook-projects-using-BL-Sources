A well-dressed lady, with a flush of animation on her face ; a tall, foxy-nosed, black-whiskered gentleman in colloquy with her, and evidently not doing much to pacify her, but rather saying things which seemed to add to her irritation ; and both these persons were standing on the steps of the Stilborough Town Hall. The lady hesitated ; the gentleman was combating these hesitations. The lady at length yielded, and the gentleman looked round for somebody of whom he might ask a question. Providence hearkened favourably to his trouble, and sent him a furzy-haired, ruddy-whiskered gentleman with gooseberry eyes, who came tearing along, and clutched with one hand a bundle of papers, while with the other he mopped the dew from his brow. Him, the foxy-nosed gentleman, VOL. II. E"], [12, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 2 ignoring his awful majesty, addressed as if he were a common person. ' Can you tell us, please, where the Mayor is to be found ?' ' / am the Mayor,' responded the furzy haired one addressed. ' That is to say the new Mayor,' added he with a twinge, lest it should be the old Mayor who was wanted. ' My name is Pottinger.' ' I beg pardon, h'm \u2014 Mr. Pottinger \u2014 didn't know I had the pleasure I am a solicitor, and my name is Pronge. This lady is my client, Madame Rogandi. We should be glad to speak to you a moment in private.' ' Step this way, please,' said Mr. Pottinger, who had glanced at the card. ' We will go into my office. Up these stairs \u2014 after you, ma'am.' The party ascended a broad flight of stone steps, and followed Mr. Pottinger into a room on the first storey, whose door was marked ' private.' Mayors of Stilborough had reigned in this apartment for generations, and had left marks of their municipal coat-tails in the wear of the horsehair chairs, and of their municipal boots and shoes in that of the cocoa-nut matting on the floor, which was patched in places with oilcloth. Mr. Pottinger, however, sat down in it as if it had been his long ago, and as if he had an absolute proprietary right in its treasures,"], [13, "A CRIMINAL CHARGE. 3 viz., various fly-blown views of Stilborough, framed and glazed, on the wall ; diagrams of projected streets, which had not been built, and were not likely to be ; a plaster bust of a departed Mayor, with the nose broken off in the heat of some bygone electoral contest ; half a-dozen brown stone quarts, that had once held ink, but were now marshalled in a dusty row on a shelf, in company with the bust in question, and a large miscellaneous collection of grimy old papers, the majority of which were no doubt applications and remonstrances supposed to be under ' anxious consideration,' which is the official and corporate euphemism for 're ferred to the rats and mice.' ' Pray be seated, ma'am,' said Mr. Pottinger, fussily adding the documents in his hand to a stack of similar ones which encumbered the table. ' Anything I can do to oblige, I shall be 'appy, but my time's precious.' ' We will be brief,' replied Mr. Pronge, who often repeated this phrase as if conscious that his nasal intonations were not a music which anyone would care to hear for a very long time at a stretch. ' My client and I are come ' ' I beg pardon, are you Mr. Pronge Pronge and Skure's, Goater's Inn?' interrupted Mr. Pottinger, glancing anew at the card. ' Ye-es, that is my firm.'

' ' Wine merchant and grocer, sir,' responded Mr. Pottinger, as if the jam-pot and treacle part of his business was quite subsidiary to a grand wholesale trading in vintages. ' And perhaps you number Sir Peter Carew among your customers ? ' ' Sir Peter has ceased to deal with me,' said Mr. Pottinger, ' and I cannot say whether the honour of having him on my books at this moment would compensate me for the almost absolute certainty I should feel of never being paid.' ' I see we shall understand each other,' re marked Mr. Pronge, with an attempt at merri ment which displayed two rows of yellow teeth, jagged as a hyena's. ' Mr. Pott \u2014 Pottingrass, I will be brief. My client and I have been re ceived with the utmost contumely this day at Royster Hall ' ' Just like Sir Peter,' replied the new Mayor, rubbing his hands. ' You went to ask for money, I s'pose ? ' ' Money due for years.' ' And he kicked you out of the house ? ' ' Not quite that, but ' I wonder at it,' observed Mr. Potting-er,"], [15, "A CRIMINAL CHARGE. 5 philosophically. ' The servants of his house have circulated that he is going about swearing that he will pull my nose. But I don't fear him, Mr. Pronge. Our noses are under the protection of the law, which will not stand by and see them interfered with ' ' The law can reach him in many ways, as he will find to his cost, Mr. Pottingrass. I will be brief : this gentleman and his daughters owe my client Madame Rogandi, who is a modiste, eight thousand pounds ; and, not only does Sir Peter refuse present payment, but he sends haughty letters through his solicitor declaring that he never shall pay, but will plead the in fancy of his children, and I know not what else, before any judge in the land.' ' Eight thousand pounds ! ' echoed Mr. Pot tinger, stricken with surprise. ' Why, how was such bills run up ? . . . not by dresses surely ? ' ' Dresses and costumes,' drily answered Madame Rogandi, who evidently looked upon Stilborough 's chief magistrate ar; a poor creature. ' You don't say it \u2014 now there's sinful extra vagance for you ! ' exclaimed Mr. Pottinger, aghast. ' Why you'd dress an honest family for eighty years with such a sum as that, ma'am.' ' They would be a very badly-dressed family,' was the court milliner's Juno-like answer. ' It is not the amount I complain of, if they would only pay it. I consider that there has been no"], [16, "6 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. extravagance, for the young ladies have only been supplied with such goods as were neces sary to persons in their station.' Mr. Pottinger subsided : mayhap he was brooding on the parlous condition of a social circle whose members were condemned to order 8,000/. worth of gowns and such things ' to appear respectable.' He vacantly scribbled on his blotting-pad a reckoning of the number of gowns that could be purchased for 8,000/., taking the price of a smart gown, according to his notions, at 10/. (an outside price), but also making a reduction because of the quantity bought. This left Mr. Pronge free to spin out his story of the Carews' embarrassments, and to show how, little by little, the debts had accu mulated to such a pile that the Baronet now found it convenient to repudiate some of them. However, this method which custom had con secrated, and financial morality approved, when resorted to by Oriental states, was not so easy of accomplishment in the case of private fami lies. ' Sir Peter's daughters had, possibly with out knowing it, placed themselves within reach of the criminal law, and ' ' Eh ? ' ejaculated Mr. Pottinger, looking up. 'What's that about criminal law ?' ' I mean that Sir Peter's daughters being recently in want of funds to help pay their brother's bets, as I believe, have raised money"], [17, "A CRIMINAL CHARGE. 7 on divers goods which they had obtained on credit, and this is an indictable offence \u2014 it's swindling*.' ' And who told you they'd done this \u2014 pawned the goods if I understand you rightly ? ' asked Mr. Pottinger, confounded. ' We have it from the pawnbroker himself, who knows Messrs. Reuben, the jewellers1 and 1 The pawnbroker and Madame Rogandi being in fact the same persons doing business under different names. The modus opcrandi for introducing young ladies to pawnbrokers is as follows : \u2014 First, a debt for dresses is contracted towards a milliner, who soon suggests trinkets as a suitable adj'unct to the finery, and recommends an excellent jeweller (a confederate). Perhaps a perfumer and glover is added to the circle, and now all these people begin to play into one another's hands. Goods have been supplied on the understanding that they shall be paid for at the young lady's marriage ; but one day one of the trades- men puts in a sudden claim for immediate payment on the ground of pressing difficulties. He hints that if the young lady cannot settle he shall be compelled to send in the bills to her father ; however he will give her a week to raise money. In the course of this week a milliner's assistant appears, bringing a dress to be tried on, and skilfully contrives to extract from her customer a confession of the latter's predicament. The milli- ner's assistant (it is generally an assistant, and not the principal, who undertakes this sort of job) at once states that there is no cause for uneasiness, for that she can give the address of a broker who will advance money on every sort of deposit, and with all secrecy guaranteed. Sometimes it is the young lady's own maid (bribed by tradespeople) who is the temptress ; but in any case the result is the same. The girl, fearful to reveal her difficulties to her parents, and not knowing how to procure ready money by other means, sends her maid to the pawn broker's with some of the trinkets that have been obtained from the jeweller on credit ; and pacifies her conscience with the reflection that she shall redeem the things when her next quar-"], [18, "8 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. Madame Rogandi. Most of the young ladies pawned bracelets, watches, necklaces and things of that sort to help one of their brothers out of debt ; but one of them, Miss Amy Carew, who seems to have had fewer trinkets to dis pose of, added a sable pelisse and muff to her sisterly contribution, and this places her at the mercy of my good friend, Madame Rogandi, ter's allowance is paid her. Needless to say that the quarter's allowance, being required for pocket-money, is never applied to the purpose intended ; on the contrary, as the jeweller still con tinues profuse in his offers of credit, fresh trinkets are taken of him to replace those which have been pledged ; nay, the facility of raising money on jewels having once been demonstrated, trinkets are often taken for the express purpose of being pledged. Thus, month by month, the web of difficulties is woven more closely round the thoughtless young victim, who is now com pletely at the mercy of her purveyors, for they can swoop down on her with threats of a criminal action at whatever moment it may please them to coalesce and exact payment. In the case of girls, a rich marriage is generally the only method of extrication ; but sometimes young married ladies are drawn into the same kind of net, and how they often try to escape has been exposed in many and many a Divorce Court suit. The whole system of credit, as worked by certain London tradesmen, has many more features of objectionableness and iniquity than have been hinted at here ; but it may be remarked, that, if the tradesmen who decoy young ladies into extravagance deserve all the reprobation which a just anger can suggest, a great deal of blame lies also with parents, who must be perfectly aware that their daughters are wearing a great deal more finery than their allowances can possibly pay for, but who yet ask no searching questions. Some mothers are even understood to encourage their daughters to get into debt \u2014 debt being the safest preservative against falling in love with gentlemen having more personal fascinations than money."], [19, "A CRIMINAL CHARGE. 9 by whom the said sables were supplied on credit. What Madame Rogandi now proposes to do, by my advice, is to apply to you for a warrant for the apprehension of Miss Amy Carew, on the charge of obtaining goods by false pretences ' ' What do you say ? ' exclaimed Mr. Pottin ger, with his gooseberry eyes rolling in his head. ' A warrant against Miss Amy Carew,' re peated Mr. Pronge. ' I do this with great reluctance,' said Madame Rogandi, coldly ; ' but I hope it will not be necessary to put this warrant in force.' ' Quite so \u2014 quite so,' took up the rosy-nosed lawyer. ' We hope that it will be enough to exhibit the warrant, and that the wholesome terror it will convey to the occupants of Royster Hall will induce them to effect a settlement.' ' And you want me to have Miss Carew arrested ? Not if I know it,' exclaimed Mr. Pottinger, bringing down his hand with a slap on the table. ' Why, you two Londoners must be out of your minds to suggest such a thing ! ' This was unexpected. After all that had preceded it came as a non sequitur. But Mr. Pottinger was quite in earnest, and looked as if his dignity as an official, and his common sense as a man had been ruffled by an outrageous pro position. He glared at the lawyer and the mil liner, and would have talked of ordering them"], [20, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 10 out of the room, if either of them had shown the least sign of being afraid of him. Lest this attitude should seem inconsistent with the determined spirit which the grocer had displayed in warring with the Baronet about Stubb's Piece, it must be recollected that Mr. Pottinger's quarrel had lain with the races, not with Sir Peter himself, and that having now pre vailed he was too prudent to push his victory to extreme lengths. Sir Peter was not so ' down' as to make it safe for anybody to kick him ; but even if he had been as completely prostrate as the lion in the fable, Mr. Pottinger was not going to inaugurate his mayoralty by an act which might be construed into petty malice, and make his odour unsavoury for ever in the nostrils of his fellow-townsmen. Whatever was done against Sir Peter and his sons or daughters should be done without him ; of that he was re solved, and he flatly said so. Mr. Pronge, however, had managed people of more importance than a provincial mayor, and he quickly reminded Mr. Pottinger that a magistrate sits to administer the laws, not to juggle with them according to his likes and dislikes. A swindle had been committed, and his client, Madame Rogandi, was entitled to redress. The mayor had been applied to in pre ference to the police, for it had been wished to keep this distressing affair as quiet as possible ;"], [21, "A CRIMINAL CHARGE. 11 but if Royster and its inmates were beyond the borough jurisdiction, that, of course, was another affair, and Mr. Pronge would then only trouble Mr. Pottinger to give him the address of some other justice of the peace. This Mr. Pottinger did with alacrity, and wrote down the name and address of the vicar. The London lawyer had so resolutely snubbed him that he felt mortified and nervous. The business looked an ugly one. Let him get rid of it with as much expedition as he could. ' You had better go and see Mr. Rushbrand, our Vicar, who is a newly appointed magistrate,' he stammered, rising to bring the interview to a close. ' My time is precious, else I'd go with you.' ' Pray don't trouble yourself,' answered Mr. Pronge. ' Good morning,' said Mr. Pottinger. ' Good day to you,' replied Mr. Pronge, in an off-hand way ; and as he descended the stairs Mr. Pottinger overheard him saying : ' I think we had better stop at the police-station on our way, and ask the Superintendent to come with us ; it will be more regular.' Off they went, and they were hardly out of the Town Hall before Mr. Pottinger was out too, leaving all his pressing business to take care of itself. It was not in human nature to sit and work closeted, whilst an event of such sensational"], [22, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 12 dimensions as the arrest of Sir Peter Carew's daughter was impending. What a scandal ! What a matter to talk of ! Only just fancy Miss Amy \u2014 that beautiful young lady, so straight and proud on horseback, being brought down to the Justice-room, and indicted on a criminal charge before him, Pottinger ! And just fancy him, Pottinger, being obliged to commit her for trial ! The world was indeed full of ups and downs, but this last ' up ' was a bit too much at once. ' Hie, Nibbs!' cried Mr. Pottinger, and hurried across the Market Place to speak to the chemist, who was strutting forth to post a letter. Mr. Nibbs was soon made acquainted with the whole matter, in strict confidence. He was an honest man, who could as soon hold a secret in his mouth as a hot coal on the tip of his tongue. Then Dr. Poltisham sauntered by and was made to share the secret, likewise under promise not to breathe a word to a soul ; after which Mr. Pottinger thought it best to hasten home and say a word or two to his wife, ' lest the rumour should reach her through some one else, and upset her.' Now, putting a secret into Mrs. Pottinger was like pouring new wine into an old bottle. By the time the new Mayor had returned to the Market Place, the other two gentlemen had posted off to say just a word to their respective wives, and had contrived also to"], [23, "A CRIMINAL CHARGE. 13 whisper just a few dozen words to friends whom they met by the way. They came back looking mysterious as Sphinxes, and were joined by some other desultory gentlemen who asked them why they looked so mysterious, and winked and said : ' This is a bad business, ain't it?' 'What's a bad business?' asked Mr. Pottinger. ' Why, this Carew business.' ' Ah, you see, the matter is known all over the town, and it ain't any use to try and keep it secret,' remarked Mr. Pottinger, despairingly. So they did not keep it secret, but discussed it aloud under all its phases \u2014 past, present, and contingent \u2014 and, as they chattered like magpies, they sidled towards the corner of the Market Place, and stood where they could command a view of the vicarage door, and read by the looks of Mr. Pronge, as he came out, what had been the success of his errand. Excited magpies they were, waiting for meat."], [24, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 14 CHAPTER XXI. SIR GILES TAPLOW DISTINGUISHES HIMSELF. That morning there had been a very stormy domestic scene at Royster. The inopportune visit of Madame Rogandi and her solicitor, had thrown Sir Peter into a paroxysm of fury and bad manners. He insulted the elegant milliner before his servants, calling her a jade, a thief, a corruptress of morals, and he tossed all her bills into the fire pell-mell. When Mr. Pronge talked of law, all the benefit he got was to have a stalwart, septuagenarian fist shaken within an inch of his nose, while Sir Peter bawled in his face : ' Law ! Zounds! it's on you I'll have the law, you disreputable abettor of yonder minx. Get out of my house the pair of you. You ought long ago to have been set picking oakum ! ' and a significant gesture of his fore finger showed them the shortest way to the door. When Madame Rogandi and her solicitor had decamped, the above scene of objurgations was renewed in family committee ; and the"], [25, "SIR GILES DISTINGUISHES HIMSELF. 15 result was that, an hour or so later, when Sir Giles Taplow called, he found all the feminine portion of the household in tears. This was on the morrow of the Sunday when he and Amy had gone to church together ; and the late victim of tight boots had, this morning, bestirred himself earlier than was his custom, in order to bring his apologies for not having returned to fetch Amy after the service. He had her all to himself, for her sisters, after shaking hands with him, hurried out of the room to conceal the traces of their weep ing. These traces he easily perceived, but he abstained from inquiring why Amy's eyes were red, and her handkerchief damp, for one of his maxims was that if you asked a woman why she had been weeping, she always burst out afresh, which was a bore, for he hated ' whine and water.' He deposited a waterproof cloak (Paul's) on a chair, sat down, crossing his legs, and started at once with his excuses. ' I hope Sir Peter got the note I sent up last night, Miss Amy, to explain why I didn't come back for you ? I was awfully sorry. ' Yes, thank you, papa gave me the note ; but there was no need to apologise.' ' Oh yes, I owed you all sorts of apologies. But it really wasn't my fault ; you would have"], [26, "16 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. died of laughing if you could have seen what it was that delayed me.' ' Was it so very comical then ? ' said Amy, thankful to him for not being inquisitive about her eyes. 'Oh, wasn't it, just! It was as good as a pantomime, though I didn't think so at the time, for I was the pantaloon of the farce, you see, and was being hocussed by my valet, who played clown. The beggar had actually put all my boots under lock and key, and gone out for a walk with the key in his pocket !' ' Dear me, how provoking ! and what did you do ? ' ' Well, you know, in the first moment a man swears at that kind of thing, and I fancy I swore. Then I pulled and repulled the bell ; but now came the best part of it, for there wasn't a soul in the house. I hallooed down the stairs, but not a voice answered. Valet, footman, cook, maids, groom, coachman \u2014 all that lazy, trolloping lot had gone out. It's true I had told my man that I should perhaps not be home till ten, but that wasn't a reason for them all to desert the house at the same time, so that any scamp who had liked to stroll in and break open the pantry drawers, could have walked off with my stock of spoons ! ' ' To be sure not ! What a breach of duty ! ' ' Aye, but that is what comes of being a"], [27, "SIR GILES DISTINGUISHES HIMSELF. 17 single man, and having no one to command your household, Miss Amy (here a sigh as from a furnace). However, let me go on with my story. When I found it was of no use to shout, I came back to my dressing-room, and tried to break open the door of the boot cup- board with a poker. \" Better spoil a lock than keep Miss Amy waiting,\" thought I ; but, by Jove, the lock wouldn't let itself be broken. Its little iron teeth held on to the catch like Old Harry. Lug, hammer, and wrench as I might, I couldn't effect an opening, and when I had spent my strength and anger by giving the tough old panels half-a-dozen kicks that would have splintered any modern door into match wood, I gave up the attempt as hopeless. Note that all this time I still had those con foundedly tight boots on, for even my slippers had got mislaid.' ' How very trying! Why, your narrative is quite dramatic, Sir Giles.' ' Isn't it, egad ? But wait a minute : seeling myself baffled I became like the fellows in melodramas, and brooded vengeance. I had wasted so much time over the lock, that it was too late now for me to return and join you, so my only thought was, how to read my vagabond servants such a lesson as they would remember for a long while to come. I first discharged the man who had driven me from Stilborough in a vol. ii. c"], [28, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 18 dog-cart, then, having pulled off my tight boots, and put on an extra pair of thick socks, I pro ceeded to barricade the house. I fastened every shutter, locked every door; let loose Tear'em in the yard to check anyone who should try and climb over with a ladder from the garden ; and, this done, I set to work creating just the disorder that a very large and very active gang of burglars might have done.' ' Oh, Sir Giles, what an idea ! ' ' Ingenious, eh ? I wanted to make the beggars feel downright bad as soon as they should manage to force their way into the house, and I warrant you the litter was a thing to see. Without damaging any of my own property, I managed to make things look as if there had been a general scrimmage and smash. I over turned chairs and tables, scattered fire-irons, fenders and sofa cushions, unhooked pictures, hid away clocks ancl chimney-ornaments, and going up to the bed-room floors, bundled out every article of bedding into the passages and down the staircases. It was as good as a feast to think of the hard work which all the louts and husseys would have to set things straight again, and I took good care they should not be able to defer their labours till another day, for I served their own rooms worse than the others ; emptying out all their drawers, and mixing the contents of them at haphazard, the coachman's"], [29, "SIR GILES DISTINGUISHES HIMSELF. 19 shirts with the cook's smocks, the butler's pan taloons with the housemaid's petticoats, and so on. As to the locked boxeS, where, as I sup pose the servants kept their savings, I stowed them all away in a lumber room under layers of old carpets, where Old Nick himself couldn't have found them.' ' Dear, dear me, Sir Giles ! why you must have driven the poor creatures almost mad.' ' Well yes, I think the poor creatures were fairly crazed,' grinned the baronet, chuckling at the recollection. ' It was about six o'clock when the first batch of them came home, and as they fumbled at the door of the commons which they had left unlocked, I heard them say, shivering in the rain, how glad they should be to get their teas. This gave me a new idea, and I started off to the kitchen to rake out all the fire from the grate, and turn on the boiler tap, allowing the hot water to run over the floor, so that the first business of the cook and maids might be to exercise themselves with the mops instead of quietly drinking tea. When I re- turned to the scullery, I overheard them all in confabulation outside the door, wondering who could have locked and bolted the door ; and presently the coachman \u2014 who is the cook's sweetheart, by the way \u2014 said he would go and fetch a ladder and climb over into the scullery yard. He never got further than the wall's c 2"], [30, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 20 crest, however, for Tear'em \u2014 whom I have taught to hate the whole pack of them \u2014 set up such a barking that the man sat outside the wall irresolute in the dark ; and whilst he was in this position I, who had gone to the pantry which overlooks the yard, gently raised the sash and let fly the two barrels of my gun, which I had loaded with powder. What a yell ing followed, how the coachman let himself drop from the wall like a cat, and took panic stricken to his heels along with the virgins and matrons his companions, I leave you to guess. As for me, I laughed like a man revenged and went up to my room (the only tidy place in the house), to wait for what would come next \u2014 and I took Tear'em with me, not so much for his company, as to prevent his being shot by the servants when they returned, as I knew they would, with the police, and half the population of Taplow village.' ' Oh, but Sir Giles, are all these facts ? or are you only inventing to amuse me ? ' laughed Amy, growing a bit incredulous. ' Facts, 'pon my soul, all facts ; and every thing happened as I had calculated it would,' laughed Sir Giles. ' About half an hour after the gun-firing, a veritable army came up to besiege the hall ; and Tear'em being off his post, it was not long before some of them got over the wall and let the others through the"], [31, "SIR GILES DISTINGUISHES HIMSELF. 21 door. I heard them stream through the pas sages like an inundation, they kept together for fear of ambuscades, and uttered lamentations as they went, like friars on a fast-day ; but of course the servants were more concerned about their own belongings than about mine, and a full hour elapsed before they thought of coming down and exploring in my room. The faces of the invading mob when they opened the door and saw me coolly seated before the fire, with a pipe in my mouth, \" Bell's Life\" on my lap, and Tear'em curled up at my feet \u2014 was a pic ture for gods and men.' ' That it must have been,' said Amy, who could not help feeling amused. ' What did they say ?' ' Well, my valet was the first to speak. He's a Scotchman, and when he had recovered from the notion of my being a ghost, he stammered : \" Sorr Giles, d'ye noo tha're 'ave been borglars in t' hoose ? \" I removed the pipe from my lips, stared at him in silence, and then said : \" If there have been burglars you must have had a hand in introducing them, and I shall cer tainly have you and your fellow servants kept in custody until this matter is cleared up,\" \u2014 which was adding insult to injury, for they were already trembling like jellies. I kept up this joke until I saw them all frantic, and beginning to abuse and accuse each other ; then I told"], [32, "22 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. them the truth, and to calm their minds ordered them to bestir themselves about getting me some supper.' ' Well, they spent an exciting Sunday, which they will remember for some time. And what was the upshot of it all ? ' ' Oh, this morning the women and the coach- man have given me warning,' said Sir Giles, with a shrug. ' And I don't care though, for I think of putting my household on a new footing, and I wouldn't have kept this worthless crew long, even had they wished it.' Sir Giles had given his facetious little narra- tive in a rattling style enough, and the doing so had lent animation to his voice and features. When a man relates without exaggeration, he generally relates well; and our baronet both looked and spoke his best while retailing an adventure in which he had figured not indeed as hero, but as a man who puts the laughers on his side. He was conscious of the effect pro- duced, and this emboldened him to come in a very natural, unembarrassed manner to the sub ject next his heart. ' Yes, Miss Amy, a pack of servants is more than a single man can manage,' he said, leaning forward, and speaking in a lower tone ; ' and do you know I have had an idea trotting for some while past in my head. Can you guess what it is ? '"], [33, "SIR GILES DISTINGUISHES HIMSELF. 23 ' How should I ? ' rejoined Amy, whose heart fluttered. ' Well, it is thatyou should come and manage my servants and my home. What do you say to it ? ' ' Oh, Sir Giles ! ' ' I hope you won't say no,' pursued the baronet, leaning more forward, and speaking more soberly. ' I know I am not worthy of you, and all that ; but you are the only woman whom I have ever cared for, and I give you my word I'd try to make you happy.

Is it agreed on, eh ? ' and Sir Giles stood up, close to Amy. ' Why \u2014 Sir Giles \u2014 ' was all she could find to falter. . ' Silence gives consent then ! ' he said, jovi ally. ' We'll look upon it as a settled thing, eh ? ' and, stooping, he kissed her. And so it was all concluded without her say ing yes or no. She had made no fine speeches about not being able to bestow her heart with her hand ; she had not cried or pleaded for time to reflect \u2014 a minute had passed, and she was pledged for life : that is all ! Sir Giles, in capital spirits now, continued to talk, and somehow she found herself standing in a window embrasure,"], [34, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 24 with his arm round her waist, for her betrothed was not bashful, and hastened to avail himself of his new privileges. He was chatting to her about his future hopes\u2014 not very remarkably, but with a confidential homeliness which showed that he was fully minded to make her a sharer thenceforth in all his housekeeping troubles ; and when he had gloated his fill, he suggested that he should go and apprise Sir Peter of what had taken place \u2014 after which proposition he turned and kissed her again. ' Yes, I think you had better go and speak to papa, Sir Giles,' murmured Amy, trying gently to disengage herself from his clasp. 'Sir Giles, hullo ! ' he echoed, in jocular re proach, and making his embrace the tighter, ' there mustn't be any more of that you know \u2014 call me Giles, or Gi', if you like it better, as they used to do when I was a young 'un.' ' I think you will find papa in his study,' said Amy, blushing, and without using any appella tion, for how hard those endearing Christian names are to pronounce when it is not the heart that moves the lips ! ' Very well, my love, I'll skedaddle in that direction. One more kiss, though \u2014 oh, that was only half a one \u2014 there, that's better. And when I've spoken to papa, what do you say to you and I and your sisters and Jack going out for a ride together ? We might push on to Hazel-"], [35, "SIR GILES DISTINGUISHES HIMSELF. 25 wood, and I could let Hartleigh hear of my hap piness first hand ? ' ' If you like ; in that case I will go and put on my habit,' said Amy, with a little sigh, not liking to resist her affianced's first behest, and feeling for her part that anything would be bet ter than remaining indoors to be congratulated, fondled, and chattered to by her sisters about her marriage. ' That's all right then,' said the baronet, as he swung round cheerfully on his heel. But in going to the door his eye fell on Paul's water proof, and he pointed it out to Amy. ' By the way, my pet, don't let me forget to take that with us. It belongs to parson Rushbrand. I boned it from his vestry yesterday, and I must return it.' ' Yes, for he missed it,' said Amy. ' I heard him inquiring of the verger about it.' ' Sorry if he got wet through loss of it, but I should have been sorrier still if I had got wet,' said Sir Giles, with indifference, and from the doorway he blew his betrothed a kiss. He was gone, to Amy's great relief; and she caught up the waterproof from the chair to carry it into the hall. As she did so there fell from one of the pockets, which was being held mouth downwards, an envelope. She picked it up and the open flap showed her that it contained a photograph. A letter she would have restored"], [36, "26 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. to its place, of course, but a photograph ! Where is the girl or woman who is not inquisi tive about the photograph which men treasure. A little shake of the hand, it may have been accidental, and the portrait half came out of its sheath, so that she could take a peep at it. The likeness she saw was her own. Her own. And he must have bought it, for she had never made him a present of one ; and he had also written some words at the bottom : _ Genesis xxix. 18 and 20.' All at once Amy remembered the words that he had spoken to the verger, saying that his cloak contained some thing ' of great value to him \u2014 of more value than money.' Quick as thought, nimble as suspicion, were the fingers that seized on the cloak, and rifled its pockets, to see if they contained any other thing of value. They held nothing. Then Amy, who felt faint, turned to a folio pictorial Bible that lay on a side table of the drawing-room, and sought out the text indicated. The large letters seemed to shine into her eyes like fire as she read : \u2014 ' And Jacob loved Rachel ; and said, \" I will serve thee seven years for Rachel, thy younger daughter.\" ' ' And Jacob served seven years for Rachel ; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had for her.'"], [37, "27 CHAPTER XXII. a mayor's domestic jars. The wedding-day was fixed ; the country papers and the London journals announced the match ; and one of the earliest bridal presents which Amy received came to her at the same time as her betrothed's first bouquet. It was an en velope bearing the London post-mark and con taining all her tradespeoples' bills receipted. Amy showed the suspicious parcel to her sisters, who concluded that this was Sir Giles's doing and that it augured well for his generous disposition in the future ; but when Amy thanked her betrothed he stared and asked what she meant. An explanation became necessary, but on the stamped papers being shown him, the baronet disclaimed all knowledge of them. He was not even aware, said he, that Amy had debts, and hoped devoutly that she would not incur any more, for creditors were' abhorrent in his sight. This drove the sisters to conclude that it was their father who had privately effected the settlement ; but as the mere mention of"], [38, "28 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. a bill acted upon his temper as a spark upon powder, none of them dared ask him whether this were so or not. It was Paul Rushbrand who had paid these bills; and Madame Rogandi could have told how strange his behaviour had been when he was requested to issue a warrant against Miss Carew. He had seemed as much appalled as if the young lady were his sister ; and the in dignant look that had spread over his face after the first shock was past had made the milliner and her lawyer feel uneasy with a bodily fear. But he had restrained his anger and inquired calmly what was the amount of Miss Carew's debts ? The amount stated to him by Mr. Pronge was 525/. ; and he then asked whether the lawyer would accept his bill at seven days for that sum ? Mr. Pronge was not desirous that Miss Amy's debts should be settled apart from those others of her relatives, for he wished by acting against her to overawe the whole family ; at the same time it did not suit a man of his pro fessional eminence to seem to be doing any thing blackguardly. He accordingly accepted the promissory note on behalf of Amy's credi tors, but frankly remarked that these creditors would not be deterred from taking criminal action against one or other of Miss Amy's sisters if a satisfactory arrangement were not made about all the debts. The execution of"], [39, "A MAYOR'S DOMESTIC JARS. 29 these menaces was naturally stayed by the an nouncement of Amy's forthcoming marriage with the wealthy Sir Giles Taplow. As to Paul's promissory note, it was cancelled within twenty four hours by the transmission of a cheque payable by a London banker. More than half the amount for which this cheque was drawn had been borrowed by Paul of Mr. Pottinger, for his own resources were unequal to the sudden demand. Mr. Pottinger lent the money readily, and though he guessed to what purpose it was to be applied, asked no questions. But when everybody was talking of Miss Amy's fine match (a pretty contrast to the fate which had seemed to impend over her a few days previously !) the busy grocer dropped into the vicarage 'just to see how matters were going on there ; ' and what he saw of Paul's altered mood justified him in saying to his wife at dinner that day, that he thought the vicar had been pretty hard hit in the region of the heart. Notwithstanding that the Mayor of Stil borough had for a long while been doing a brisk grocery business, and that now his expen diture of 7,000/ in the purchase of ' Stubb's Piece ' had classed him among the plutocrats of the borough, and was driving more and more customers towards his shop (for thus ever do rivers flow towards the sea), the fare spread daily at his board was not of sybaritish sump-"], [40, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 30 tuousness. Hot joints one day, cold the next, and pudding twice a week, constituted an ordi nary that had not been departed from since the time of Mr. Pottinger's father \u2014 the inaugurator of the second pudding ; for in the grandsire's time one pudding only had been allowed. Mr. Joseph Pottinger had innovated to the extent of adding dessert and a bottle of Marsala on Sundays \u2014 the said dessert consisting of the broken figs, dates, almonds and raisins which could not decently be sold to customers, and the Marsala being of the thinnest, cheapest quality. But now that he had risen to such high estate and honour, the new mayor had more than once pondered, with his hand on his waistcoat, that richer fare would be suitable to his improved dignity as well as grateful to his palate. He had reached an age when yesterday's leavings washed down by ' swipes ' cease to realise the preconceived ideal of a festive banquet ; but on his timidly communicating these views to his wife, that lady turned a deaf ear. She was a thrifty matron, of the sharp-faced, angular-elbowed, dyspeptic sort, whom her hus band had taught to keep terrible check over him by means of Bible quotations. When a man continually flourishes a particular weapon he must expect to see his victims become profi cient in its use, and Mrs. Pottinger had been so frequently belaboured with scriptural texts in"], [41, "A MAYOR'S DOMESTIC JARS. 31 the earlier and flightier days of her wedded life, that now she yielded to no one in the art of crushing an antagonist under a pious saw having nothing whatever to do with the case in point. Joseph's pleas for better dinners were met by allusions to the flesh-pots of Egypt ; his remark that the Biblical patriarchs had all loved good-feeding \u2014 witness Isaac and his con fessed fondness for messes of savoury meat \u2014 was answered by the retort that the patriarchs cut their coats according to their cloth, and did not amuse themselves by throwing away sums of 7,000/ to buy bits off race-courses. The fact is, these seven thousand pounds were' a sore point with Mrs. Pottinger, for her husband, out of fear of her glib tongue, had not told her the truth respecting them. The towns men believed that their new Mayor had saved up the money, intending to launch on a building speculation that would eventually make a mil lionaire of him, or conduct him to the Bank ruptcy Court. His wife knew better, and was irritated beyond measure that he should pre sume to keep this thing secret from her. She had vowed to herself that until the amplest avowals were made to her as to where the seven thousand pounds had come from, there should be no alteration in the dinner bills of fare, but such as might be suggested by the resolve to render them more frugal than they"], [42, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 32 were already. On his side, Mr. Pottinger, taking a leaf out of the book of the woman who importuned the unjust judge, kept harping daily on his prandial wrongs, and introduced them with an untiring and ingenious obstinacy inci dentally to circumstances not even remotely connected with them. He did so in speaking of Paul Rushbrand's downhearted aspect : ' Yes, my dear, I had never suspected it be fore, but I feel no doubt of it now that the vicar had a sweet tooth for Miss Amy. He looked so chopfallen that if I had thought there would have been anything decent to set before him, I would have asked him in to dinner, just to cheer him up a bit.' ' And pray, Joseph, why was not the fare of our table good enough for Mr. Rushbrand ; who, I believe, has eaten much worse in his life ? ' answered Mrs. Pottinger, stung to the quick, for she would have esteemed it a mighty honour to have the vicar to dinner. ' Cold mutton with not so much as a pickle to it,' growled the Mayor, as if the cup of his persecutions was overflowing. ' Where is the pickles to-day ? ' ' The old bottle was finished, and mother said we wasn't to open another,' remarked Mr. Pottinger's heir, a pimple-faced, tow-haired youth of eighteen."], [43, "A MAYOR'S DOMESTIC JARS. 33 ' Now then, Ezekiel, hold yottr tongue,' cut in his mother. ' Oh, papa, why didn't you invite Mr. Rush brand to dinner ? You know we could have sent over to Cherry's and got a tart,' observed Martha Pottinger, a plain but good-natured young lady, who like most of her species had a weakness for the lesser clergy. ' I'm not going to invite strangers to spy out the barrenness of our larder, Patty,' replied her injured father. ' The people of Stilborough would at least expect that their Mayor should be able to afford a tart without being obliged to send to the pastrycook's for it, as something hextra.' ' That's a reflection on my housekeeping, I suppose,' ejaculated Mrs. Pottinger, with lips puckered up. ' No, papa didn't mean anything unkind,' said Patty, who often interfered as peace-maker. ' The long and short of it is I'll have pickles with my dinner,' shouted Mr. Pottinger. ' Zek, go into the shop and fetch in a bottle \u2014 best quality.' ' Best quality, that's it \u2014 there's nothing too good for his lordship now ! ' said Mrs. Pottinger ironically. ' Well, mother, you can't say that a honion and a girkin or two is out of place with this mutton,' observed Zek, returning with the jar. ' The meat is so stringy that it wants a relish.' VOL. II. D"], [44, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 34 ' Oh how can you tell such a story, Zek \u2014 it's quite tender and juicy ! ' exclaimed Martha, with her largish mouth full. ' Never mind him, Patty,' said her mother ; ' it's his father that's taught him to mock at the vittles for which five minutes ago he was asking 'Eaven to make him truly thankful.' ' I s'pose Zek has as much right to hold an opinion about mutton as his sister,' grumbled the grocer Mayor, prodding his steel fork into a piece of pickled cauliflower. ' Oh certainly, Joseph ; and also to bear false witness against his mother in respect of bad meat and cooking, as his father does.' ' I'll tell you what it is, if I can't eat my meals in peace without being nagged at, I'll go over and dine at the Red Lion,' bawled Mr. Pottinger, throwing down both fork and pickle jar ; then, having by these means obtained a terrorised hush, he caught up his knife again, sliced savagely at his meat, and cried : ' I don't know how it is, but none of my friends who have fat wives are served in this way. Fat women are always kinder and cheerier than you thin ones, who, because your diges tions are poor, grudge everybody a bit of good eating.' This was a staggerer, for amongst all the bickerings of wedded life Mrs. Pottinger had never calculated that she would have her lack"], [45, "A MAYOR'S DOMESTIC JARS. 35 of adipose tissue inveighed against as a sin : but she quickly rallied : 'Well, Joseph, my digestion was given me by 'Eaven, and I trust I'm becomingly grateful for it, as I am for all of 'Eaven's gifts, good and ill \u2014 and as to fat women, it would be saying a good deal, I expect, to pretend that they hadn't their faults as well as us thin ones.' ' I don't know what their faults may be, but I wish you were fat,' rejoined Mr. Pottinger, doggedly ; ' and I hope Zek will be fat, and Patty too, and have a fat husband ' ' Oh, papa, I don't at all,' sang out the young lady. ' That's because you don't know what's good for you ; but I do, and I don't want to hear it said of my family that they are famished and ill-favoured like Pharaoh's lean kine.' ' No, you would rather get the praise given to gluttons and wine-bibbers,' broke out Mrs. Pottinger, tartly. ' You would like to have it said of us : \" This people's heart is waxed gross \u2014 they have made an idol of their bellies \u2014 they are fat and kick \" ' ' No I shouldn't,' blurted out the Mayor, irately, ' and people wouldn't be so foolish as to talk like that either. The better fed we were, and the more they would honour us, for what do the Psalms say : \" So long as thou doest good unto thyself, men will speak well of thee.'\" D 2"], [46, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 36 ' Ay, but you can do too much good to yourself, Joseph Pottinger, so that people shall say : \" Behold he heapeth up riches, but where do they come from ? \" I should be glad to hear that your seven thousand pounds for that race ground had been honestly come by, Joseph ; but my conscience is very uneasy about it, so I tell you here, before our children.' Zek and Patty exchanged blank looks. Mr. Pottinger rose from his chair, changing colour, and Mrs. Pottinger, like most people whose tongues have inflicted a puncture deeper than was intended, felt chilly from fear of conse quences. The grocer Mayor strode from the room in silence, not without dignity ; and Mrs. Pottinger's children upbraided her for having taxed their father with dishonesty. She rocked herself in her chair, saying it was very hard to be abused for one's thinness, for rearing thin children, for having a bad digestion, and for trying to keep household expenses down ; but harder^ than all was it to feel that there might be money lying about the house in heaps, un known to her. How was she to know that the cellars were not full of bags of gold, that there were not piles of bank-notes under the flooring, and cheques behind every wainscot ? At this picture of harrowing possibilities Patty Pottinger began to cry, and her brother told her not to 'blub,' for which breach of correct language"], [47, "A sMAYOR'S DOMESTIC JARS. 37 and brotherly tenderness he was sharply ordered to go out to his work behind the shop-counter, and to let the apprentice come in to his dinner. At the same time Mrs. Pottinger removed the newly opened pickle-jar out of the hungry apprentice's reach,' declaring that so long as she ruled the house, and until she knew \u2014 as every lawful wife had a right to know \u2014 what were exactly the resources that her husband had to dispose of, she would not let the family substance be wasted in riotous living \u2014 not she. And, in truth, she was too stubborn a dame to be subdued by any of the means that her husband had at his disposal ; so he wisely gave in to her. Returning, by-and-by, mild as milk, he was closeted alone with her for half-an- hour, and took her into his confidence con- cerning Lady Hartleigh's share in the purchase of Stubb's Piece. Her ladyship, wishing to have the races transferred to Hazelwood Park, had promised to lend him (Pottinger) the money, if he would like to buy Stubb's Piece on his own account ; but this was really equiva- lent to a gift, for she could not expect him to pay her 7,500/., which was more than three times what the ground was worth. He would probably, some day or other, reimburse her 2,000/ or so, and the rest would be the price which she would have to pay for gratifying her whim. As for himself, Mr. Pottinger had"], [48, "38 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. entered into negotiations with one Rodgie, of London, who he hoped would soon come and set up his dye-works on The Still ; and, as it was not his desire to sell Stubb's Piece, he proposed that Rodgie and he should enter into partnership for carrying on the dye-works to their mutual advantage. All this, however, was contingent on the utmost secrecy being observed, for if Lady Hartleigh were to suspect that she had been betrayed, she would never forgive him, and he should thus have incurred the enmity of two great families instead of one. ' And have you actually got the money, Joseph, or is it only a promise ? ' asked his wife, mistrustfully. ' It's in my desk there \u2014 seven thousand pound notes, and one five-hundred. I s'pose her ladyship was too clever to sign a cheque. She came into the shop yesterday, saying she would settle the last quarter's bill, and in doing so she poked the roll of notes in my hand, when nobody was looking. ' It's a large sum to spend on a whim,' observed the grocer's wife in a reflective way. ' All that's not necessaries is whims, from a diamond necklace to a two-penn'orth of treacle, and we all of us spend more on our whims than on our needs,' was the mayor-grocer's philo sophical and apposite rejoinder."], [49, "A MAYOR'S DOMESTIC JARS. 39 His wife was satisfied, and from that day the dinners set before him were of a sort befit ting his high station. However, Mrs. Pottinger had for her intimate crony Mrs. Jones, wife of the tailor, and, as the saying is, they could keep nothing from each other. Neither could Mrs. Jones hold back anything from the hair-cutter's wife, Mrs. Wigson, who was her sister ; and this faithful spouse had no secrets from her husband, who was wont to let all he heard trickle into the ears of the persons whom he shaved or whose heads he washed. Thus the transaction between the Mayor and Lady Hartleigh soon got whispered in corners, till, by a roundabout way, it reached Sir Giles Taplow, by whom it was communicated pretty bluntly to Helen Hartleigh's husband."], [50, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 40 CHAPTER XXIII. MORE JARS. Lord Hartleigh was much offended, and at once sought out his wife. She was in the con servatory inspecting some camellias, for his col lection of which the Hazelwood gardener was famous. In the dowager Lady Hartleigh's time this important servant had allowed no one to enter the conservatories without his leave and company, but Helen had quickly snapped this rule as she had all others that interfered with her despotic sway. She was in the act of wiring a half-bloom scarlet bud to put into her hair when her husband came in frowning. ' I say, Nell ! what's this I hear, that you have given Pottinger money to buy \"Stubb's Piece\" ? It's not true, I hope ?' 'Who is your informant?' asked Helen quietly, though she reddened. ' Taplow \u2014 but lots of other people seem to be talking about it, and it's an awful nuisance that such a damaging rumour should get about.' ' Damaging to whom ? '"], [51, "MORE JARS. 41 'Why, to me, to you \u2014 to both of us. It looks as if I had played the Carews an under hand dog's trick.' ' I might deny the thing, Charlie ; for there is no proof, but I prefer telling you the truth,' said Helen after an instant's self-deliberation. ' The fact is, it is necessary that we should be masters in the county ; and it will be more proper that the races should be held here than at Royster.' ' Confound it, Nell, you've disgraced us !

' Yes, and an unkind thing I thought it to be at the time.

Old Lady Higham would never have called so soon if the Carews hadn't led the way ; and the Pompermores, and the De Chevrons, and the Tallmans, they've called What else can you want ? ' ' Yes, I know people are beginning to come who fancied they might be the losers if they continued to turn up their proud noses much longer,' said Helen complacently, ' but I don't think it's very complimentary of you, Charlie, to talk as if all these stuck-up people had done your wife a great honour.' ' I didn't say that, Helen, but you know that after oar marriage\u2014 h'm\u2014 in fact there was some unpleasantness \u2014 and ' ' Well, but you dear old goose, don't you understand that if I fight shy of these Carews I have my reasons,' interrupted Helen impatiently. _' The whole family are ruined and only hang- ing on to respectability by the skin of their teeth, as Sir Giles would say.

Let your little wife manage for you and she'll do nothing to your hurt, of that you may be sure ; ' and hereon she nestled to his shoulder and chucked his chin with a cajolery which had never before failed to seal his lips. But on questions of honour Lord Hartleigh was not a child, and he thought that his wife made too light of his deserved reproaches. This was the first regular tiff they had had since their marriage, and Helen's flippancy im pelled him to attempt an assertion of his authority. The mistake he committed was to speak in a tone of pomposity, which is only likely to succeed when inaugurated on the very day of the wedding and adhered to subsequently as a habit. Helen first joked at his lecturing, then became angry ; her temper was none of the longest, and her voice grew shrill. Lord Hart leigh, exasperated, repeated that there had never been such a thing as a mean act perpe trated by any of his family, and that he expected his wife would behave herself as all the former Ladies Hartleigh had done. At this Helen broke into a taunting laugh. ' Oh, don't talk in that silly way, Charlie. This is the second time you have stalked out your tall horse, Ancestry, to-day, just as if I didn't know what some of your former Ladies Hartleigh were.'"], [54, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 44 ' What do you mean by that, Helen ? ' asked the young lord very red and startled. I mean that I have read through all your family papers, and that there was a Lady Hart leigh in the last century who carried on an amorous correspondence with a French marquis, and a Lady Julia Hartleigh who eloped to Bath with a Lord Royster, of the elder Carew branch, and a Lady Topsy Hartleigh, about whom two gentlemen fought duels on Wormwood Scrubbs. I hope those are not the ladies whom you hold up to me as example ! ' ' You have raked up ignoble calumnies utterly unworthy of credence,' gasped Lord Hartleigh. ' Well, you can read them for yourself among the old letters upstairs, if you don't believe me.' said Helen, plucking off another camellia. 'Of course these are things I should not allude to except between ourselves.' ' And you ought to have been ashamed to mention them to me, knowing how much they would grieve me if true and vex me if false. But you have shown yourself to me in a new light to-day, Helen ; and, after what has passed, I am inclined to rejoice at something which had been a secret trouble to me till to-day \u2014 a false hood which you told me on an occasion.' ' What falsehood ? ' ' Why, you know I was induced to marry"], [55, "MORE JARS. 45 you under a certain belief. Ahem ! you know what I mean.' ' And it turned out that I was mistaken. Well, what of that ? ' asked Helen placidly. ' The mistake was a fortunate one, since had I not made it you probably would not have mar ried me.' ' Anyhow I have never uttered a reproach to you on this matter, and I am less inclined to do so now than ever ; for if you feel so little re spect for the family into which you have entered you would instil very poor notions of duty into a child, and it is well under the circumstances that my name died with me.' ' Come, come, Charlie, you are quite melo dramatic to-day,' said Helen, coaxingly, for she was beginning to regain her composure. ' Look at Nellie, old man, you know I didn't mean what I said, let us make it up and have an end of it.' ' No,' rejoined Lord Hartleigh, stiffly. ' I could have forgiven anything but that,' and he left her. And so he could have forgiven anything but that ; and so will men often feel a deeper wrong at insults inflicted on their ancestors than on themselves. Most family cupboards have their skeleton, but many a holder of cupboard keys is, like Lord Hartleigh, unaware that he has ugly bones in his house, and feels small grati-"], [56, "46 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. tude to those who, out of malice, dispel his ignorance. A man proud of his ancestry is like one who believes he has a precious jewel in his keeping ; he does not care to learn that he has been prizing paste. The young peer went out, wounded and moody, and sought refuge in his study \u2014 where his studies were generally confined to ' Bell's Life ' and the ' Racing Calendar.' Of course there could be no permanent estrangement between himself and his wife. He knew that he should see her again at dinner-time, that he would be reconciled to her, and that they would jog on together to all seeming as good friends as before ; and yet the bloom was gone from their intimacy, and there was henceforth to stand between them a trench, to fill up and bridge over which a woman must needs cast off all her faults and failings and develop into a new nature. Lord Hartleigh was so much shocked at the disrespectful revelations concerning his ancestresses' high jinks, that he was minded to go upstairs and thrust all his family papers into the fire, and he was only deterred by the re flection that if he did so he should seem to lend a colour to tintless fables. As to Helen's con duct towards the Carews, its effect upon him was to make him yearn to render this persecuted family some service ; so that if any one of them had appeared before him at that hour to request"], [57, "MORE JARS. 47 a loan of money, he might have had any sum he pleased to name, and welcome. By-and-by Lord Hartleigh went out for a stroll, and as he walked along with a cigar in his mouth and a favourite spaniel gambolling by his side, it occurred to him that he was no longer his own master. If he had dared he would have gone straight off to Pottinger, and made things right about Stubb's Piece, by getting this luckless bit of land transferred to himself as though by a new sale, and he could then have gone to Sir Peter, and told him that there should be no change as regarded the races. But could he do this without exciting the fierce anger of his wife, and was it worth while to thwart her for the sake of helping a friend whom this piece of generosity would probably not save from ultimate ruin ? Lord Hartleigh shrank from making his home a purgatory, and he was not the first who has preferred to com pound an unkind act sooner than suffer by reme dying it. Meanwhile, Sir Giles Taplow, riding by another road than that which Lord Hartleio-fi had followed in his ramble, had come to Hazel wood in order to take Helen to task about her conspiracy with the grocer; for since his en gagement with Amy the concerns of the Carews were in a manner his concerns, especially where money was involved. It was his ill-luck to"], [58, "48 THAT ARTFUL VuCAR. light upon Helen at a moment when she was in a most execrable humour. She was at lun cheon alone, and her small grey eyes kindled as soon as the baronet was announced ; her hus band she had chastised with whips, this man she prepared to flog with scorpions : ' I know what you are going to say !

Charlie has been plaguing me about it till my head aches, and I have had quite enough of it.' ' Well, but it looks just like one of your games, Nell, and I have come to warn you to let the Carews alone,' said Sir Giles menacingly, as he flung himself into a chair. ' The world is large enough for us all to live and let live without jostling one another, and I give you my word, that if you try to bother my future wife's people I'll retaliate on you.' ' I should like to see you attempt it,' she said with a shrug. ' All you could do would be to tell Charlie what you know about me, and he would horsewhip you for the trouble.' ' And I'd take out a summons for assault against him ; your pretty history would all come out in a police-court, proved by witnesses, and you would be a ruined woman.'"], [59, "MORE JARS. 49 ' And you would be a ruined man by the same stories, for not a gentleman in England would consent to remain in the same room with a cur who had hounded a woman,' was Helen's cool answer, as she ate some grapes.

But, by the way, since you talk of police-courts, I should advise you to tell your future wife's sisters to take their jewels out of pawn, or else they may get into trouble, as Miss Amy herself was very near doing the other day.' ' Now, that's some other infernal bit of mis chief you have got hold of, or are brewing, I presume,' snarled the baronet. ' Now, what is it \u2014 out with it ? ' ' What, haven't you heard ? ' tittered Helen, taking up some more grapes. ' Oh, I must tell you, for it's quite a good story. I had it fresh from my milliner, Madame Rogandi, who will probably regale other ears with it ; ' and with evident relish she related the tale of the warrant that had been applied for to the Vicar, of the latter's payment of one tlwusand pounds, etc. Her narrative contained numerous em bellishments, for it had not been told her by Madame Rogandi (who knew better than to babble about such things), but had reached her through her maid, who had got it from the butler, who had picked it up second-hand from VOL.

' That's right,' said Helen, ' get tipsy to compose yourself. Shall I ring for some gin?' ' And do you say that all Amy's sisters have put themselves in the power of the law in this way ? ' faltered Sir Giles, disregarding her taunt and wiping his lips on his cuff.

Why look at yourself in the glass, man \u2014 just contemplate your seductive figure, your sweet looks, your ' ' Hold your tongue, will you, you vixen ? ' snapped Sir Giles, savagely.

' Poltroons, ecod ! ' muttered Sir Giles, be tween his teeth ; ' they call it cowardly to insult women and parsons, and these are the most spite ful, dangerous vermin in society ! ' ' Yes, and you blackguard women \u2014 that's another of your amiable qualities,' pursued Helen ; ' but come, I'll give up baiting you, Sir Giles.

When you've got her to wife, she'll lead you a pretty life, and all her relatives will come sucking at your money bags, till you'll wish you were quit of your bargain.' ' Well, I'll risk it,' growled Sir Giles, defiantly. ' She's a good girl, and if she doesn't like me now she will by-and-by, because of what I shall have done for her.'

Sir Giles had rested his elbows on his knees, his chin on his hands, and he felt a miserable man. He loved his money and he loved his ease, and he feared to lose both money and ease together by contracting a dupe's match ; he remembered a proverb about the man marrying a woman who doesn't love him, being like one that sets a trap and baits it with his own finger. But as he pon dered on this, Amy's sweet face rose up before him, with its eyes so candid, soft, and noble. ' No ! ' cried he, springing up. ' All women are not like you, and the best of some women is, that you can trust them blindfold. I shall never find such another wife as Amy Carew. If it costs me twenty thousand \u2014 fifty thousand pounds, well, I'll pay them, for she's worth it.' ' Why, dear me, Sir Giles, this is quite ro mantic,' ejaculated Helen, mockingly.

LADY POMPERMORE. Lord Hartleigh's stroll had brought him to the confines of his own park ; he opened a lodge gate and passed into the old coach road to Stil borough. It was a fine cold morning in late autumn. The white sparkling frost clung to the long dog weeds in the hedges ; the bramble's crimsoning leaf spread crusted with silver ; the cobwebs hung white, spangled nets over the crevices in the barks of trees, where spiders, frozen and dead, were 'swaying like felons in fetters'; and overhead robin-redbreasts were twittering in the denuded branches. A waggonette came along, drawn by two sleek horses, and driven at a leisurely pace by a plump coachman \u2014 just the equipage that would have been recognised at a glance as belonging to a rich old lady, careful of her men and of her beasts. The proprietress sat inside, warmly muffled in a cloak of silver fox, and with her a spry lad of fourteen, who sung out : 'Hie, Lord"], [64, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 54 Hartleigh ! ' and vaulted into the road before the vehicle stopped. ' Diggie, Diggie ! ' shrieked the old lady \u2014 ' you naughty boy, you ! Oh, Lord Hartleigh, that boy will be the death of me.' ' How do you do, Lady Pompermore ? Were you going to see us ? ' said Lord Hartleigh, lifting his hat, and laughing. ' Yes, auntie wants to consult you about me,' piped the spry lad in the melodious tone of boys, whose voice is breaking. ' Just tell her to send me to Eton. Will you ?' ' I think I can walk through the park with the help of your arm,' said Lady Pompermore, and Hartleigh assisted her to alight. ' Diggie, if you promise not to go too fast, and to mind what Buncles says, you can drive the waggon ette up to the Hall, and make your bow to Lady Hartleigh before we get there.' ' You say that to get rid of me, you know,' sang out Diggie. ' Never mind, here goes,' and he jimply climbed on to the box, unceremoni ously elbowed Buncles on to the left-hand seat, and flourishing the whip over his sluggish team in a way that must have mightily astonished them, was gone through the gate in a trice. ' Digby Popham has grown ; he'll be a man soon,' remarked Hartleigh. ' He's the worry of my life, and he'll shorten my days,' sighed Lady Pompermore, who was"], [65, "LADY POMPERMORE. 55 a pattern of those excellent old ladies whose lives are perpetually being worried by juvenile relatives whom they dote upon, whom their bounty nurtures, and whose names are always to be found in their wills affixed to thumping legacies, which are bequeathed with every term of endearment and gratitude. Lady Pompermore owned a flock of nephews and nieces, and her house would not have seemed habitable to her unless she had always had several of them staying in it to romp, make a noise, and surfeit themselves. Lord Hartleigh, who knew her benevolence, spoke consolingly of young Pop ham's prankishness. ' You should send him to Eton, since he wants to go. His high spirits will find full career there.' ' No, I don't approve of large public schools, with their rough ways, scant teaching, and corporal punishment,' answered Lady Pomper more, shaking her head. ' Diggie is delicate, though he doesn't look it, and I should not like him to be fagged and birched.' ' He certainly doesn't look delicate,' smiled Lord Hartleigh, ' and I can assure you he would get no more fagging and swishing than are good for a boy.' ' That's what all men say, but I would rather send him to a private tutor's, where he would have exclusive care and supervision."], [66, "56 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. You see, my good friend, boys are like plants,' added the fond aunt, with a gleam of that good sense which shines superior to ordinary weak ness, and reveals the truest affection, ' and while some plants can be left to grow up wild with their companions, others require a good deal of looking after. I am not blind to Diggie's faults, and fear that at Eton he would not get sufficient surveillance to correct him of them.' ' That is another thing,' said Lord Hart leigh. ' I admit that Eton is no place for a boy whom it would be dangerous to leave to himself. But who is the tutor with whom you wish to place your nephew ? ' 'Well, I wanted to ask your opinion of Mr. Rushbrand, whom you appointed to the living of Stilborough ? ' ' It was not I who appointed him : recollect I allowed the parishioners to choose their own man. But I shouldn't recommend Rushbrand. as a tutor for any relation of yours. He is not a gentleman.' ' Oh surely, Lord Hartleigh ! . . . Why what attracted me towards him was the account that has been given me of his past life \u2014 how he educated himself and supported his father's widow ; and then there was that heroic conduct of his at the fire, when he rescued the poor little baby ' ' Oh, in the sense of \" handsome is that"], [67, "LADY POMPERMORE. 57 handsome does,\" Rushbrand is a thorough gen tleman,' conceded Lord Hartleigh, not very willingly. ' He is one of Nature's gentlemen, as the saying goes ; but, dear Lady Pompermore, there is another old sense to the term gentleman which I think it is as well should not be lost amongst us. The man who has been bred among gentlemen, at school and college, who has passed his life in their companionship sub sequently, and who holds by all their traditions not only in the observance of the greater vir tues, but in that of the smaller and nicer ones of tact, modesty, and non-interference in the concerns of others \u2014 that man is, I venture to submit, alone competent to give a boy the fine polish which conceals the rough grain of your mere plain-dealing Christian.' 'You don't like Mr. Rushbrand, then ?' ' I neither like nor dislike him,' said Lord Hartleigh, who at that moment was certainly not qualified to claim the flitch of Dunmow, and who felt nothing like a gush of gratitude towards the man who had tied his wedding knot. ' WTell but, as to polish, don't you think there can be too much of it ? ' screamed her ladyship in the high falsetto of old ladies who are talking in the wind.

' Well but, isn't Digby Popham his uncle's, Lord Pandaddie's heir ?

' But he is seventy if he is a day, and he can scarcely hope ' ' Humph ! my good friend, the man who marries at sixty may go without an heir, but the bridegroom of seventy always has one.' The young peer laughed at this jest a la francaise, so did the utterer of it ; and they walked on. Lord Hartleigh remarked that what had been said of young Popham's pro spects, altered the case as to the kind of tutor whom it might be desirable to obtain for him. If he was not to lead the easy, gilded life of a youth who has great expectations, but to carve a career for himself by force of merit at the Bar or in the Civil Service, Mr. Rushbrand pos sibly was the tutor who could best train him in habits of energy and self-reliance. Lady Pom permore, who was sincerely (not cantingly) re ligious, confessed to a great liking for men who had entered the Church from vocation, as Mr. Rushbrand had ; she thought such ministers worth any number of those who took orders from worldly motives, and was sure they must"], [69, "LADY POMPERMORE. 59 have in them the gift of persuading boys to become good men and Christians. Lord Hart leigh had sense enough not to attempt eradi cating the idde fixe of a lady, and so chimed in with her arguments ; but he pointed out that as the living of Stilborough was a valuable one, it was doubtful whether Mr. Rushbrand would consent to burden himself with the charge of a pupil. Would Lord Hartleigh kindly write to sound him on this point, and offer him liberal terms, say 200/. a year ? \u2014 asked Lady Pomper more. Yes, Hartleigh would do that, but he thought it would be better that, before any arrangement were entered into, Lady Pomper more should see the Vicar, and judge whether she liked him or not. It was arranged that Mr. Rushbrand should be requested to call at her ladyship's seat, The Beeches \u2014 and so this matter was settled. ' Well, now I have another thing to talk to you about,' said Lady Pompermore, who was a recipient-general of other people's troubles, and had almost always several parcels of woes to unfold when she went visiting. ' Do you know I have just been seeing that poor young thing, Lady Ambermere, and she is in a dreadful way about Oswald Carew.' ' Why doesn't she marry him, then ? . . .It would be the best thing for both of them.' ' Ay, but he won't,' screamed the old lady,"], [70, "60 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. quite dolefully. ' The truth is, she was foolish enough to say him nay the first time he asked her, before that wretched business about the dead Russian, and now that he feels himself disgraced, he will be too proud ever to ask her again.' ' I can quite understand that,' said Lord Hartleigh. ' Oswald is incapable of an un gentlemanlike act; but all the world don't know him as we do, and that money business was certainly disastrous.' ' Yes, and see what a price he has been made to pay for it ; all those spiteful news papers barking at him, and the Horse Guards forcing him to sell out ; and then all his wretched creditors falling upon him and threatening to make a bankrupt of him, as I hear ! It's quite maddening to think of, and Louisa Ambermere was so tortured by it that she hastily left some friends whom she was visiting in the North, and has come back here to cry her eyes out com fortably in her own house.' ' What, is she at Ambermere Court now ? ' ' Yes, and almost frantic in her desire to help the Carews,' said Lady Pompermore, halting to take breath. ' But how she can with propriety do it is the question ; and it's harrow ing me, too, to whom she has appealed for advice. You see, if she were to write and offer herself to Oswald Carew, it would be unwomanly"], [71, "LADY POMPERMORE. 61 \u2014 besides it would look like charity, and he would refuse in a way that would render their ever coming together at a future time im possible. If she were to offer him money, it would be worse ; and yet, as the poor, good hearted young thing says, \" It's exasperating to have twenty times more money than one wants, and to be unable to give any of it to save those whom we love better than life.\" Her idea is that Oswald's debts should all be paid without composition of any sort, and that his father should retire from Parliament in his favour at the next election, for when a man has got into the least scrape he should beware not to drop out of society. People soon forget and forgive all that has been said about a young man who can tack M.P. to his name ; the only thing they never forget and forgive is ruin.' ' I quite concur in all that,' said Lord Hart leigh, feelingly, 'at the same time I hope the predicament of the Carews is not so bad as they say. As Giles Taplow is going to marry Amy Carew, he will be bound to do something for the family.' ' Humph ! ' grumbled Lady Pompermore, making a contemptuous grimace. ' Those Taplows have never been favourites of mine. Puddle blood, my good friend. Of course Sir Giles will be bound to do something, unless he breaks off the match on learning the full extent"], [72, "62 THA T ARTFUL VICAR. of Sir Peter's embarrassments, which I think very likely ; but anyhow we must go to work without counting on him.' 'I, for my part, am ready to do anything and everything,' said Lord Hartleigh. ' I was reflecting an hour ago how glad I should be if Oswald or any of them came to me for assistance.' ' Thank you, I did not expect less of you,' answered the old lady, pressing the arm on which she leaned, and she went on to say that they must put their wits and purses together to see what could be done to save -Royster Hall. She had known Sir Peter forty years, and her father had known his father, and it would sadden her declining years if she saw that grand old stock of Carews uprooted from the county. All these sentiments were exactly those which Lord Hartleigh himself harboured, and when Lady Pompermore, as she finished speak ing, held out a hand to him to seal their bargain of charity, he raised that hand, covered with its wrinkled grey glove, to his lips. But, for all this, he could not shake off his fear of Helen, and, while promising co-operation, pondered how he might give his succour unknown to his wife. He suddenly recollected what Helen had told him of Paul Rushbrand's paying Amy's debts to save her from arrest ; and, forgetting how he had just hinted that the Vicar was a"], [73, "LADY POsUPERMORE. 63 man of no tact, he suggested to Lady Pomper more that they might ask his advice as to conveying assistance to the Carews in an un obtrusive delicate manner. The old lady was more anxious about the good which she desired to do than particular as to the means of effecting it, and readily nodded her approval to this suggestion. But here they came within sight of Hazel w*ood lawn, and a sudden loud scream of terror escaped Lady Pompermore's lips as she saw her nephew dangling by the back of his knees from a tree branch twenty feet high and yelping glee fully to her. This delightful youth had driven up to the Hall and made his bow to Helen, as ordered. Helen did not like boys (it requires a very genial nature in young women to like them), and consequently she deemed that the way to show them kindness was by spoiling them. Being but just risen from lunch, she made young Popham sit down to a refection of pastry and claret (he had dined before starting, but this has never interfered with a boy's enjoy ment of more food), and when he had stuffed himself she ' tipped ' him a sovereign. Young Popham decided she was a brick, and drew her out of doors to exhibit his prowess in climbing trees. She entreated him to cease from such a dangerous amusement, but he mocked her"], [74, "64 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. womanly fears, and having climbed an acacia, which he could just clasp with his arms, crawled on all fours along an outlying branch, sat down thereon, and tilted himself backwards, so that he hung by his knees, as he had seen acrobats do on trapezes. ' Hie ! Look at me, Lady Hartleigh. I'm like Leotard,' he yelled, head downwards. ' Come down immediately, sir,' cried Helen in alarm. ' No, here's auntie, and I want to frighten her. Hie, auntie, if you don't promise to send me to Eton I'll let myself drop and break my neck.' 'Mercy on us! the boy will kill himself!' whimpered Lady Pompermore distractedly. ' Will you come down at once, you young rascal ? ' cried Lord Hartleigh, walking quickly towards the tree. ' Will you answer me ? ' repeated the boy, whose face was vermillion. ' Now \u2014 one \u2014 two \u2014 three. Here goes.' Young Popham had not the slightest inten tion of casting himself down, but he had hung too long, and in trying to swing himself into sitting* posture again, his fatigued muscles failed to give him sufficient impetus. He made two attempts, but discovering that he could not clutch the branch with his hands, and that his knee joints were beginning to weaken in their"], [75, "LADY POMPERMORE. 65 hold, he raised piercing howls, which made all the blood in his affrighted aunt's veins curdle. Lord Hartleigh darted forward to get under the branch, but he was too late ; the boy's legs abruptly straightened and down he came like a flying cat, hands foremost. ' There was a moment's terrible anxiety, as he lay panting on the grass, but he slowly ga thered himself together, and resting on his knees, with cheeks blanched, and eyes streaming, felt himself all over to see if he was hurt. Find ing that he had no fracture or sprain, he rose to his feet and whined in a voice that was half-sob, half-laugh, ' You see, auntie, I kept my word.' ' Come, now, that won't do,' said Lord Hartleigh ; ' you didn't let yourself fall on pur pose ; ' and he owned to himself that Master Popham's want of sincerity did place him in the category of boys who require special looking after.

It was a civil, correct letter which Lord Hart leigh wrote to Paul, offering him the tutorship ; and though the proposal came so unexpectedly, Paul felt inclined to accept it. He wished for some engrossing employment to divert his mind from the secret grief that was gnawing him. One of the beliefs he most fondly cherished was that respecting the constant interference of God in things human : he believed that what ever righteous thing a man ardently pursues is given him at length, unless it be for his own good or that of others that it should be denied. He saw in all things the agency of God work ing for the general happiness of his creatures ; and things which appeared the result of acci dent to others were not viewed in that light by him. When he heard of Amy Carew's betrothal, he knew, from the intense pang which he felt, that he had for some time been loving her ; and"], [77, "NEW LABOURS AHEAD. 67 it became obvious to him that if he had been prevented from wooing and winning her, it must have been for his own good or for hers. But surely it was for hers rather than for his ; for he could not but have been improved by marrying a creature so fair and gentle, whereas it might well be that he was wanting in the qualities that could make her happy. The fact that she had run so deeply into debt \u2014 though under overwhelming temptation \u2014 proved that she wanted guidance, and perhaps he was not the man to have given it her. Possibly he was wanting in the wisdom that can mould a woman's mind ; or it might be that he was too much puffed up by his recent rise in the world ; perhaps, again, in the felicity of marriage he might have grown neglectful of his pastoral duties, for as St. Paul puts it, 'He that is mar ried careth for the things of the world, how he may please his wife.' There was no end to the reasons which Paul put before himself why he was not worthy to be Amy's husband, but he was woefully dis concerted when he ventured to ask himself why Sir Giles Taplow should have been accounted superior to him in the sight of Heaven ? Not all the modesty he could muster would persuade him that he was not the baronet's equal in good ness ; and he was fain to conclude either that the ways of Providence are quite inscrutable to F 2"], [78, "68 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. man, or that poor Amy was, for moral disci pline's sake, about to be afflicted with a hus band who would make her miserable, but who would be mercifully removed when his wife's purification by sorrow should be complete. This was rather a far-fetched explanation, but it pleased Paul, for it allowed him to look for ward to a future time when Amy would be again free, and when he might yet claim her, after having waited patiently his term of years, as Jacob did for Rachel. Yes, Jacob for Rachel ! That was the Scrip tural episode to which he had referred in the writing which he had so imprudently placed at the back of the photograph which he had left in the pocket of his waterproof cloak. That cloak had been returned by Sir Giles, but, strange to say, the photograph was not in it ! Evidently Sir Giles must have ransacked the pockets ('just like him,' thought Paul) and have found this tell-tale carte, to his no little vexa tion. Well, it was his own fault, and Paul was not sorry for it ; still, when he reflected that after marriage Sir Giles might show this por trait, with its inscription, to his wife, and that they might have a laugh at it together, he could not help reddening as if he actually heard him self being made fun of. His love was no laughing matter to him. It was so strong that it carried him above the"], [79, "NEW LABOURS AHEAD. 69 sentiments of anger and jealousy, which a man generally experiences when a woman whom he loves plights her troth to one unworthy of her. From all he had heard and seen, Amy was being driven into the match, and he could for give her for this act of self-sacrifice \u2014 as she had so pathetically hinted it to be in that Sunday conversation near the font (how well he recol lected every word of that conference now !), where she had stated the supposititious case of Miss Jackson. 'Well, I'll turn schoolmaster,' exclaimed Paul as he folded up Lord Hartleigh's letter. ' Work is a good doctor ; ' and he went to ask his stepmother whether she would have any objection to his receiving a pupil in the house. The little Frenchwoman did object at first, and would have continued to do so if it had not been for the thought that ' her Paul ' might derive solace from the companionship of a lively boy. Although not a word had ever passed between them as to Paul's attachment for Amy, Mrs. Rushbrand was not slower than others of her sex and age in putting two and two together ; and she knew that when a man after having been hilarious, brisk, and sanguine for weeks, suddenly loses his appetite, becomes taciturn, pensive, and occasionally morose, it is time something should be done to revive him. One of the drawbacks to Stilborough, in so far"], [80, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 70 as the Vicar and his mother were concerned, was that they had found no friends to chum with. If they had been in a sea-port parish they would. soon have made themselves a circle of seafaring acquaintances among the captains and mates of merchantmen and their families ; but at Stil borough the country gentry were a degree above them (that is one degree above him, the ex-cabin boy become vicar, and many degrees above her, the ex-fisherwoman), and the local tradespeople were a degree below them, besides being uninteresting persons to boot. So, Mrs. Rushbrand, prefacing her permis sion with the hope that the coming pupil would be a laughing boy, addicted to games, and able with his knife and fork \u2014 for she abhorred ' good ' boys \u2014 said she would choose among the mani fold rooms of the parsonage, the one best suited to Master Popham. But, hereon Paul bethought him of some other boys whom it might be a kindness on his part to send for and educate along with Lady Pompermore's nephew \u2014 namely, two sons of his old rector's, Mr. Ful mouth. Mrs. Rushbrand shook her head when this divine was mentioned. He dropped out of her good books from the day when he had complimented her curtly and drily \u2014 as if the doing so cost him an effort \u2014 on her son's elec tion to the vicarship, and he would have been much more blackly noted by her, had she been"], [81, "NEW LABOURS AHEAD. 71 cognizant of the scolding he had administered to Paul, fever-stricken and defenceless ; Paul, however, had himself lost all recollection of this scene in the dreams of delirium ; all he knew of the matter was that, on recovering his health, he had found amongst his other letters a very contrite one from Mr. Fulmouth, apologizing for ' hasty words,' and trusting that nothing would ever occur in future to disturb the har mony of their friendship. Since then a few epistles had been exchanged, Mr. Fulmouth having done his utmost to revive harmony by requests for small loans (20/., 50/.), which were to be faithfully repaid next quarter-day, and which Paul cheerfully lent, knowing they could never be repaid at all. He was aware of the hard fight which his old rector was compelled to make daily with poverty, in order to feed his overgrown family, and he fancied it would be an acceptable form of kindness if he offered to take two of the young Fulmouths altogether off their father's hands, and educate them for nothing. The arrangement would be conve nient in every way, for it is easier to teach three boys together than one alone, emulation, if not pushed too far, being a great help to the master \u2014 added to which a boy must have playfellows of his own age, or he mopes and becomes me lancholy. When these reasons were laid before Mrs."], [82, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 72 Rushbrand, she acceded to them with a good humoured French shrug, and a remark that the old ' ftresbytere' was truly going to be turned into a monkey-house now. Lady Pompermore also consented to a couple of playmates being procured for her Diggie (Paul having stated his proposals to her in a letter), and nothing re mained now but for the Vicar to call at ' The Beeches ' to see whether he suited Master Popham and his aunt, and whether they both suited him. The visit was paid on one of those bleak, raw days of east wind and sleet, when the blaze of a fire in a large grate of a country mansion is a welcome sight to a caller, and when hosts are prone to receive guests coming from out of doors with cheerier demonstrations than during finer weather. Lady Pompermore and Paul were not long in ascertaining that they could get on well together. The old lady was from the first talkative and affable, Paul listened with the quiet deference due to her age, sex, and rank ; and by his respectful bearing dispelled all notions of his being of that truculent order of divines whom worldly prosperity makes offen sive. Still less had he anything in his manner of the grasping, because hungry, clerical tutor, whom the chance of getting a pupil sets aglow like a hound sighting game ; indeed, he was so thoroughly untutorial that the old lady deemed"], [83, "NEW LABOURS AHEAD. 73 it incumbent upon her to apologize for thrusting the office of bear-leader upon him, but explained that her nephew's character, being of an ' ex ceptional kind,' required an exceptional type of man to deal with it. She then at great length described Master Popham's exceptional idiosyn crasy. He was imaginative, with a tendency to let his imagination run riot, which prevented him from being always quite accurate in his statements ; he was quick to learn, and most clever when he pleased, but the delicacy of his constitution had made him more inclined to amusements than to excessive study. That same constitutional delicacy demanded that his dietary should be dainty, for his taste was capri cious ; it also prohibited anything like violent methods being employed to coerce him, for he was extremely, nay, morbidly sensitive to pain. All of which being translated into schoolmaster's English, meant that Master Popham was a liar, idle, greedy, and a coward. Paul, however, having no pedagogic ex perience of the language in which fond mothers, grandmothers, and aunts are wont to talk of their young hopefuls, gathered that Diggie was doubtless a dreamy, romantic, girlish boy, and he was consequently surprised when his future pupil bounded in full of buxom health of rosy hue.

He had eyes piercing as a hawk's, but the use which he made of them to scrutinize his visitor from head to foot appeared to satisfy him, for he asked civilly enough whether the Vicar had found the roads in a bad state ; and, on learning that Paul had come a good part of the way by rail, remarked that he should like to perform a short journey on a locomotive engine in very bad weather to see how the stokers and drivers liked it. This observation and some others, which he made without any shyness, gave Paul a favour able opinion of the boy. Digby, as is the custom of boys in the presence of intended tutors, had put on his best manners. He was too sharp to have betrayed antipathy, even had he felt any, but as it was, he thought that the next best thing to being sent to Eton was to go to a private tutor's. He had duly stipulated with his aunt that he should have his pony at Stilborough, also a liberal allowance of pocket-money ; that he should not be required to rise before eight, or do any lessons before breakfast ; that he should come to stay from Saturday till Monday morning at The Beeches every alternate week ; last, but not least, that no implement of correc tion should ever be applied to his tender cuticle. These conditions having all been determined"], [85, "NEW LABOURS AHEAD. 75 on between Lady Pompermore and Paul in private, it was arranged that Digby Popham should enter upon his scholastic term on the following Monday. Her Ladyship postponed to another and more fitting opportunity any allusion to the Carews, for she thought it might seem odd to the Vicar if she waxed too confi dential with him at a first interview. She con fined herself to sounding him adroitly as to what families he knew in the neighbourhood, and which of them he liked ; and it was gratifying to her to notice that, whereas he spoke in kindly terms of the Royster Hall household, he evinced no prepossession in favour of Sir Giles Taplow. ' Sir Giles is a very curious person ; I hope marriage will improve him,' said the old lady, moving her fingers actively in some crotchet work. ' He is a near neighbour of ours, as you know, and I am afraid his acquaintanceship has done my Diggie no good.' ' Are Digby and he great friends ? ' asked Paul. ' More so than I care to see,' answered Lady Pompermore, ' and that is one of my reasons for wishing to send Diggie away from The Beeches. I am sure it must have been Sir Giles who taught him to smoke clay pipes.' ' The boy smokes, then ? ' ' H'um. I won't tell tales about him ; but his jacket smells much like a groom's occasion-"], [86, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 76 ally when he kisses me at bed-time ; and what is worse, I fear Diggie has learned from Sir Giles a taste for low sports. ' With your sanction, Lady Pompermore, I should like to put an entire prohibition on all intercourse between Digby and Sir Giles for the future,' said Paul. ' By all means do so, Mr. Rushbrand. I shall be only too glad and grateful if you will assume the responsibility,' replied the old lady, well pleased. ' You see, it won't do for me to shut my door on such a neighbour as Sir Giles, and Diggie won't listen to me when I forbid him to go to Taplow Court. But I trust he will listen to you.' It was late in the afternoon when Paul took his leave of Lady Pompermore, and was driven in one of her carriages from The Beeches to the nearest railway-station. The lamps were already lit on the small platform as he arrived, but he had not long to wait in the wind and rain, for almost immediately his train was signalled. It came rumbling in, a porter opened the door of a first-class carriage, and Paul jumped into a compartment, tenanted by a solitary gentleman, curled up in a corner like a large grey-furred cat. ' Hullo ! is this Stilborough ?' cried the no longer solitary gentleman, sitting up and rubbing his eyes."], [87, "NEW LABOURS AHEAD. 77 ' No, next station is Stilborough,' answered Paul. ' Far off ? ' resumed the querist, with a yawn. ' Not more than seven minutes,' was the reply he got. ' That's too little for another nap, then,' said he, and shook the stiffness out of a pair of legs whose length was concealed by the folds of an ample Ulster coat. Having stretched himself and yawned again, pulled down his hat from the netting, and assured himself of the safety of a bag lying under the seat, he took a good front view of Paul, and said, ' Belong to Stilborough, sir ? ' ' I am the Vicar of Stilborough,' answered Paul, mildly. ' Ah, indeed \u2014 know Mr. Pottinger then ? ' 'Yes, he is our Mayor for this next year.' ' I'm going down to do business with Mr. Pottinger, and perhaps I may become one of your parishioners,' said the Ulsterous stranger. ' Know such a scrap of land as \" Stubb's Piece,\" on the Still ? ' ' I have heard a good deal about it of late,' said Paul. ' May I ask whether it is you who are coming down to establish some dye-factories there ?

' Factories are risky things to set up, for they"], [88, "78 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. involve more than the running up os a building and the buying of machinery \u2014 I should have to get two thousand operatives round me.' ' As many as that ! And are they difficult to find ? ' ' Well, no, for I take in all who offer them selves \u2014 male or female, halt or sound, young or dying. It's a work which requires no skill, only hands ; and as the pay is low, and as most of the hands get poisoned within eighteen months by the minerals which I use in my dyeing process, I am naturally reduced to re cruiting my men and women principally among bad characters.' ' Are you speaking seriously ? ' inquired Paul, dismayed. ' What makes you doubt it ? Oh, is it be cause you are alarmed at the prospect of seeing two thousand of the tag-rag and bobtail added to your parish ? ' and the stranger laughed. ' Well, I fear you will have to make up your mind to it. You see we can't expect the strong of limb and the honest to devote themselves to a work which is dangerous and barely remu nerative ; but such employment does admirably for the outcasts of society \u2014 people who from failing health, dishonesty, or drunken habits are unable to procure better occupation.

And you should see how the poor flock to 'em ! I'll be bound that my mills on the Still hav'n't been at work a month before they'll draw all the loose fish of your county, just as a poultice pumps up all the bad humours of a body.' ' Have you communicated all these particu lars to Mr. Pottinger ? ' inquired Paul, not at all reassured by this striking simile. ' If you have, I doubt whether he will consider it compatible with the interests of the town of which he is at present chief magistrate, to co-operate with you in setting up factories which promise to be such an unmitigated nuisance.' ' Nuisance, eh ! Why ?' asked the stranger, frankly astonished. ' You don't suppose that the picture is all shades, do you ? The factory might make it necessary for you to increase the number of your police, and it is certain that you must be prepared to see a good many more public-houses opened ; but then look at the glorious profits to your town ! Why, I suppose that every tradesman who is now making his 300/. a year would make 1,000/. in less than two years from this time, if my scheme be carried out.' Here the train reached Stilborough and stopped. ' Good evening, sir,' said the stranger collect ing his belongings. ' My name is Rodgie, and"], [90, "80 THAT ARTFUL VICAR.

He walked home to his comfortable Vicarage, and the good dinner which his mother had pre pared for him ; but was troubled all the evening by what the stranger had said \u2014 thinking to himself how very hard it is for a man to know when he has done good. Here had he been approving and encouraging Mr. Pottinger in his crusade against the Stilborough races, only to find that the races were to be replaced by an evil ten times worse. It was like that fine in discretion he had committed in forcing on the marriage between Lord Hartleigh and Helen Truman, without having taken time or trouble to inquire into Helen's antecedents. ' Look be fore you leap,' ' Turn the tongue seven times in the mouth before speaking,' ' Count the cost be fore going to war' \u2014 are proverbs in which the wisdom of ages cautions us against hasty action ; and yet who would ever leap, speak, or engage in strife if he pondered too intently on all the possible consequences ?

We can but do our best according to the light within us, and when it turns out that our best does not yield all that we expected, set about remedying, as far as we are able, the ill effects of what we have done. This Paul did by going out that very evening in quest of Mr. Pottinger, in order to warn him (lest, perad venture, Mr. Rodgie should forget to do so) of the dubious blessings that would accrue to the town from the establishment of the dye-works. But the Mayor was not at home ; his daughter, Patty, and his son, Zek, said he had gone to the Red Lion to dine with a stranger from London. Paul had no title to intrude at the hotel, and so wrote Mr. Pottinger a note, giving a short out line of his conversation with the speculator, but putting the matter mildly, so as not to alarm the Mayor overmuch. Paul thoroughly believed in Mr. Pottinger. The man's reli gious zeal, though meddlesome and fussy, was of a good British sort, and argued him to be one with whom, on all matters involving morals or public weal, a bare hint would be sufficient. Morals and public weal, however, are viewed differently, according to the standpoint ; and Mr. Pottinger's standpoint just at present was the increase of business and of gain which the mills would bring to the town and to himself. As to the proportionate increase of bad cha racters among the population, that was an ob-"], [93, "MR. RODGIE DOES BUSINESS. 83 jection to be met by a very plain argument, viz., that bad characters, if existent, must live somewhere ; and that it was as well they should live in Stilborough as in any other locality. It was not proper that one town should cry out to all the others.: 'You may take in bad cha racters, but I won't.' Much fitter was it when a righteous town took to itself the outcasts of other cities, and furnished them with means of subsistence. With the Devil's kind help, when a man sets out to surmount obstacles, he jumps over most of them quite nicely. Mr. Pottinger, looking very wise, crumpled up Paul's letter impatiently, and began to be seen going about with Mr. Rodgie, who looked not quite so wise, but nearly so. The two halted at street corners and conversed long, with much computing by means of their fingers. They would walk on a few steps, then stop again, and exhibit to each other sheets of paper covered with figures. Once they borrowed a boring rod, and went out to ' Stubb's Piece,' where they passed several hours stamping about, taking measures with a yard rule, making holes in the ground, and thrusting lumps of earth under each other's noses, as if they were pieces of cheese to be tasted. Mr. Rodgie was frequently descried removing his hat and re flectively stroking a head whose apex was bald G2"], [94, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 84 as a knee. He was a dapper, middle-aged man, with clean-shaved face, moist lips, and very liquid blue eyes. Manners, self-possessed and 'cute. He wore a handsome diamond ring on one of his fingers, and talked a good deal about the City, but no man knew for cer tain whence he came or how he had made his money. He took a day or two to pump Mr. Pot tinger quite dry as to Stilborough, its circum stances, connections, and resources ; then came the time for settling about terms, and this was done in a private room of the Red Lion, with a roaring fire, a bottle of old port, and a case of Mr. Rodgie' s London cigars for sole witnesses. Mr. Pottinger did not smoke, but he watched his friend do so, and enjoyed the aroma of the fumes. Then they fell to haggling, and Mr. Pottinger said he wanted eight thousand pounds for the land ; Mr. Rodgie laughed at this as preposte rous, and bid two thousand. The grocer shook his head, and declared that he had no great wish to sell the ground ; it would suit him better to let it on short leases, or else give it rent free and enter into partnership with a half share in the factory. Mr. Rodgie retorted that no manu facturer would be found to do business on those terms. He was not going to erect mills on any land that was not his own, neither would he be"], [95, "MR. RODGIE DOES BUSINESS. 85 bothered with a partner. It was a case of buy or let alone. ' Well, then, my figure is eight thousand pounds,' said Mr. Pottinger, inwardly quaking at his own audacity. ' You'll have to alter your figure then if you want it to suit mine, which will stick at two thousand,' answered the Londoner, curtly. ' But I myself gave seven thousand five hun dred,' stammered the grocer. ' Don't try to make me think you such a fool,' rejoined Mr. Rodgie. ' But I can show the title-deeds.' ' Oh, as to that, I have no objection to your putting down eight thousand in our agreement, provided I only pay you two thousand,' replied the Londoner. ' You probably have some end to serve in giving out that you paid seven thou sand, and that is no business of mine ; but if you sincerely expect me to give the price you ask we may as well change the subject, and talk about the way to roast eggs.' Now it did not suit Mr. Pottinger to talk about the way to roast eggs. He had noticed that Mr. Rodgie seemed very anxious to secure the ground (for provincial tradesmen are often ready readers of the human countenance, and can decypher even the physiognomies of London speculators), and there had forthwith floated through his mind a vision of a grand bonus to"], [96, "86 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. be made by himself out of the sale. What if the Londoner should really prove soft enough to give 8,coo/. ? Mr. Pottinger would have preferred to enter into partnership, but failing this, why 8,000/. would yield him a clear profit of 500/. over and above what he had paid with Lady Hartleigh's money, and considering that he need not repay her ladyship for several months \u2014 say for a twelvemonth \u2014 and that the interest on the new purchase-money ably invested at 5 per cent, might be his during that time, it looked as if he could pocket nearly 3,000/. on the whole transaction. Wherefore Mr. Pottinger held out with such exceeding eloquence for the sum he had mentioned, that he disgusted Mr. Rodgie, who sulked and said he would talk no more on the matter. But presently this long-headed bargainer committed a blunder in strategy, for after smoking moodily for a few minutes he recurred to the discarded subject by offering 250/. more than his first bid, thereby betraying that he very much wanted to get the land, and would not easily be baulked of his purpose. Thereupon they both fell to wrangling again ; but almost immediately Mr. Pottinger, acting like an unskilful general who does not know how to follow up an advantage, jeopardized his good position by consenting to partake of a second bottle of port. The third glass of this Lusitanian beverage flew to his head, and set him babbling."], [97, "MR.

So-ho ! thought Mr. Rodgie, and he slapped Stilbo rough's mayor on the knee. ' Well, but, my friend, all you want then is to make a little money out of the bargain, eh ? ' ' I want nothing but honest profit,' answered Mr. Pottinger, allowing his glass to be re filled.' ' Honest \u2014 that's understood,' replied the Londoner. ' Well, I'll make you turn the honestest little penny possible. Just follow my reasoning : You bought \" Stubb's Piece \" with Lady Hartleigh's money, consequently the land is hers, is it not, and you are only her factotum selling the land in her behalf? Well, I, buying \" Stubb's Piece,\" won't give her ladyship more than two thousand pounds ; but I don't mind letting you have seven hundred and fifty pounds for selling it me at that price. Do you under stand ? ' ' That is to say you offer me seven hundred and fifty as a commission ?' stuttered the grocer. ' That's it, my man, and the operation is a perfectly fair one,' answered Mr. Rodgie, ad ministering a severe slap to his friend's plump"], [98, "88 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. thigh. ' Mind you, Lady Hartleigh can't possibly get more than two thousand from any other buyer, so that you are doing her no wrong. As to the public, we'll square matters with them by inserting 8,000/. in the deeds as the price I paid, so that nobody will be asking awkward questions as to why you sold the land for less than you gave.' O ghosts of many a pious homily uttered by Joseph Pottinger in his family circle and before neighbours in praise of virtue ! O spirits of shame-faced thieves, whom his magisterial voice had sentenced to imprisonment ! O sanc tity ! O morals ! How will it be believed that the uprightest of churchwardens, the sternest of mayors, the most Bible-quoting of evangeli cal laymen, fell astray for a sum of 750/. ! Tell it not in Gath, that his only anxiety was how he might increase the sum to 800/., and that, having at length succeeded, he parted with his London friend, on a promise of meeting him the next day to sign papers, and went home a happy man. The street lamps winked and blinked at him, as he tottered out of the hotel, not quite steady in his steps or his visual rays ; but how bright all things seemed to his dazzled eyes ! and how joyous his stride, though erratic !

Had he been of more imaginative mind, he would have reflected that he had just been dimming that inward mirror called conscience ; but this did not trouble him in the least, for he was not conscious of having done anything but what was commercially fair ; and it would appear that commercial honesty is the standard by which a man generally prefers to measure his own conduct, however he may deal with his neighbour's. Of nothing did Mr. Pottinger think but those eight hundred pounds, and the use to be made of them. He would enlarge his shop-front \u2014 that for certain, and put bigger sheets of plate-glass into it ; also have the whole place re-decorated, and a fresh 'POT TINGER' set up in gold embossed letters, in lieu of the present inscription in yellow paint.

Thus building new shops in the air, the worthy grocer trudged off towards the High Street, and reached his house, where Zek and the apprentice were putting up the shutters, and Patty was standing in the doorway.

Everybody must have noticed that when a man departs from a long-cherished habit, he rushes upon his new course in a headlong manner. This is especially observable in respect of pe cuniary habits. A person of parsimonious ways, who in the pursuit of pleasure or profit has made up his mind that it is necessary to spend money, generally disburses largely. Probably the disbursements are so painful to him that he hopes by his largess to render a repetition of them unnecessary. Sir Giles Taplow having come to the con clusion that he was bound to help his prospec tive father-in-law, went to work in a thorough spirit. There was no generosity in the matter \u2014 only the shrewd calculation that if he did not loosen his purse-strings now, he had better re nounce the idea of marrying Amy, for that, otherwise, his wedded life would be one of worry and humiliation. If he paid none of the Carew debts, or if he doled out assistance, like"], [102, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 92 charity, he might safely reckon on having the whole family importuning him after the mar riage, and what would be his position if he said them nay ? Why society would blame him, he would experience the mortification of seeing Sir Peter go through the Bankruptcy Court ; his sisters-in-law would wail around him, and his wife would fill the air with her lamentations and reproaches, thereby depriving him of the chief object for which he was minded to enter wed lock \u2014 domestic peace. On the other hand, timely liberality on his part might succeed in setting the Carews com pletely on their legs again, and in putting the family under lasting obligations to him ; the world would say he had acted nobly ; his wife's relations would treat him for evermore with respect, and (what was a matter of equal con sequence) they would feel a delicacy about ever troubling him again ; lastly, his wife would com mence her wedded life with a sense of owing him a deep debt of gratitude, the which \u2014 being so true-hearted a girl \u2014 she would endeavour to repay by tenderness and submission. Sir Giles was not miserly \u2014 only stingy ; but he possessed a good stock of vanity, for the gratification of which he had often paid high prices for horses and dogs which he did not want, simply that he might hear people admire and envy his purchases. On a similar system it"], [103, "BENEFICIAL DOINGS. 93 was worth his while to pay a high price for a wife who would redound signally to his honour. His personal ungainliness and low habits placed him on a footing of inferiority beside most gentlemen of his acquaintance ; what a grand turning of tables it would be to abash all these gallants by the sight of a wife whom a king might covet, and whose sweet ways, obedience, and household talents might convert his home into a paradise ! Let it be remarked that Sir Giles Taplow was in a position to act very munificently with out borrowing a sixpence. His income, derived from house-property and lands, was of about 25,000/. ; but ever since he had come into his estates, he had been living at a rate seldom higher than 7,000/. a year, so that he had a sum of nearly 80,000/. invested in good securities, and convertible into specie at an hour's notice. This being so, he had no hesitation in ask ing Sir Peter to make out a full schedule of his debts. Sir Peter was touched by this kindness, but much more so were the married daughters, round whose necks their unpaid bills had been hanging of late like millstones. During the better part of a week the old baronet and two of his sons, Mrs. Warrener and Mrs. Hunt, with their husbands, were busy with knitted brows and inky fingers, making long addition suras ; and such is the eccentricity of mind developed"], [104, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 94 in debtors, that all felt in handing in the list of their liabilities, as though they were accom plishing a most meritorious act, not less remark able than if they had paid their bills themselves. Sir Giles pocketed the totals, and doubtless in the privacy of his closet pulled wry faces over them ; but he sent his stock-broker orders to sell a good bulk of scrip, and apprised Sir Peter that a sum of 50,000/. was about to be paid into his bankers and that he might draw cheques up to that amount as soon as he pleased. Then the Carews tasted that most delicious of sensations which consists in being able to pay off in full the claims of a creditor who has been insolent, and to inform him by the same post that future custom will be with- drawn. In this way were the Rogandis, the jewellers, glovers, and all of the cormorant kind dealt with. Others who had been civil in their demands were rewarded by receiving only half their dues ; others again who had been yet more civil received nothing, their bills being shelved for future consideration. Fifty thousand pounds went a long way towards clearing off the family troubles ; yet it was evident that 20,000/. more would be required to disencumber the estate of its mortgages, and at the same time it was indispensable to buy back ' Stubb's Piece,' so that Sir Peter might continue to derive a yearly profit from the races."], [105, "BENEFICIAL DOINGS. 95 Sir Giles took everything upon himself, and his behaviour was marked by considerable ability. He prudently refrained from saying anything to Sir Peter which might have sounded disrespectful as addressed by a young man to an older one ; but the other members of the family were made to digest numerous unpalatable admonitions, insomuch that they began to look, upon their benefactor with dread. He was no longer the beery-doggy Sir Giles who could be chaffed or patronised as occasion required, but a preaching brother-in-law who had far more than enough to say about the honesty of living within one's income, and the dis honesty of exceeding the same. Heaven knows where the obese young baronet picked up the maxims of conduct which he emitted with such unction, but Mrs. Warrener and Mrs. Hunt ruefully likened him, in their minds, to a fat copybook on the rampage, though they did not dare say so much aloud, against the man who now dispensed cloud and sunshine at Royster Hall. Amy was the only one among the younger members of the family who came in for no share of lecturing. Far from preaching to her Sir Giles affected to treat her as the only sane and right-principled person in the house, and deplored in her presence that her brothers and sisters had not her sound sense and insight into"], [106, "96 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. the science of life. Amy modestly disclaimed the shining qualities which were imputed to her ; but Sir Giles, revelling in his task of making her pleased with herself and with him, would not be gainsaid, and, to prove his confidence in her judgment, presented her with a cheque for i ooo/., to be employed, said he, in paying, at her discretion, any of the private little debts which her brothers or her sisters might have kept back from the lists which he had seen. This gift, which was duly appreciated by the brothers and sisters among whom it was equally divided, furnishing each with a nugget of pocket-money, was but the first of the series of bridal presents which Amy began to receive, for soon her lover brought her a beautiful pearl and diamond suite worth 3000/., the scintillating view of which caused the pretty mouths of Mrs. Warrener and Mrs. Hunt to water. These jewels had not been bought of the Messrs. Gar net, and Sir Giles, in explaining how he, too, intended to deprive these traders of his custom, thought good to tell Amy the story of the warrant, of which until then she had been totally ignorant. The poor girl's trembling and agitation at the tidings of the danger she had escaped might easily be described, but it must be left to the imagination to picture what she felt on learning that her preserver had been Paul Rushbrand."], [107, "BENEFICIAL DOINGS. 97 She instantly asked if he had been thanked. ' Oh, I hope you went and expressed our gratitude, Giles ? I should be so sorry if he could think I had heard of this and yet made him no acknowledgment' ' It's not worth while stirring up any fuss about the thing,' responded Sir Giles, lightly. ' The man only did his duty, and when these parsons render you a service, they always take care to get rewarded for it.' ' But did Mr. Rushbrand acquaint you with what he had done, or did he ask for payment in any way ? ' inquired Amy, shocked by this mode of shirking gratitude. ' Oh, no, but of course he knows that his money is safe,' responded the Baronet. ' Pro bably he means to come down on us suddenly with a request that we will employ our influence to obtain him something or other worth ten times the trifle he spent for us ; and ah, by the way, that reminds me that I have a wee bit of influence in high quarters, and I think of using it for Warrener and Hunt.' ' It's very generous of you,' said Amy, ab sently, for her thoughts were still dwelling on the previous question. ' The Duke of Grandton will be my lever to work by,' said Sir Giles.

Only you must impress on your sisters that their husbands are bound to accept any thing that is offered them \u2014 Indian, Colonial, tropical, no matter what.' ' I will,' said Amy. ' I think they are very much obliged to you for your exertions on their behalf ; indeed, I am sure we ought all to be so.' ' What I do is for your sake, though, not for theirs,' granted Sir Giles ; ' and you know, Amy, some people must be taught that beggars can't be choosers, and that kind of thing. We'll manage to help them all on condition that they help themselves, and that puts me in mind that Oswald wrote me a rather perky letter when I let him know that I would pay his debts with the others. He thanked me, to be sure, but in a tongue-in-the-cheek sort of way, sug gesting that he would as soon be left to his own devices, whatever those may be.' ' Probably he felt a scruple about putting an additional tax on your generosity,' replied Amy, quaking lest her brother should have angered her surly betrothed. ' Egad though, he needn't have written so proudly,' grumbled the latter, ' considering that, in disencumbering his father's property, I am piling up an income which he will inherit.'"], [109, "BENEFICIAL DOINGS. 99 ' I daresay that is the very reason which makes him hesitate to accept your kindness,' observed Amy, quietly, and in so gentle a tone that he was silenced. ' Well, well ! ' he said, after a pause ; ' so long as you are thankful to me, my dear, that's all I care for. As to that parson, Rushbrand, I'll see that he gets paid, and thanked too, if you wish it. ' I do wish it, and I should be so glad if I might be allowed to thank him too,' pleaded Amy, beseechingly. ' I don't of course ask to go alone and thank him, but couldn't we go to gether ? I really think it is due to him.' ' I don't ; it wouldn't be proper, and that kind of thing,' said Sir Giles, positively. ' Much better let me manage the whole thing alone, as if you weren't even aware of it, for otherwise you would lay yourself under too great an obligation to him, and feel delicately situated about him ever afterwards.' Amy sighed. Conventionally speaking, Sir Giles might be right, but it is not easy for a good heart to bend itself to conventions which stand in the way of accomplishing an act of gratitude. Sir Giles had heightened the merit of the Vicar's kindness, by seeking to disparage it, and Amy lapsed into a casuistical train of musing leading to the query as to whether she, not yet having vowed obedience at the H 2"], [110, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 100 altar, was bound to obey her future lord. But of this more anon. Sir Giles Taplow made a mental note to call on the Vicar of Stilborough the first spare hour he should have, but he did not put him self out to contrive a spare hour, and thus the visit was postponed until Sir Giles was forced to pay it in his own despite, and for no other end than to beg Paul to come to his succour in softening the heart of Mr. Pottinger. That obstinate and bumptious grocer had stoutly refused to recede from his bargain with Mr. Rodgie, although Sir Giles besought him with shrieks, and furthermore offered him ' any price up to ten thousand pounds.' ' Can you understand such confounded con duct,' exclaimed the baronet, when he had recounted to Paul all that had passed. ' The beggar actually told me that he wouldn't have sold me the land even if it had still been his, because to do so would have been tantamount to restoring it to Sir Peter.' ' Is the bargain between Mr. Pottinger and Mr. Rodgie concluded ? ' asked Paul. ' No, that's just it ; they've signed no papers \u2014 done nothing, and Pottinger might positively clear a thousand ponnds or two more if he would deal with me.' ' His refusal shows at least that he is disin terested,' remarked Paul."], [111, "BENEFICIAL DOINGS. 101 ' It shows that he's a fool and a spiteful cad,' screamed the baronet. ' I do not see that my interference would much avail,' said Paul, after some reflection ; ' my position is a difficult one, for I have re peatedly expressed myself adversely to the races, and it is obvious that if Sir Peter keeps \"Stubb's Piece\" these will be maintained. It would be different if you would make me a pro mise that the races should be discontinued.' ' I'll make you any promise you please, only put on your hat, there's a good fellow, and go and talk down that grocer,' shouted the baronet. ' I know you're a great hand at arguing when you please, and that reminds me that I owe you something (he drew a cheque from his pocket), there's the five hundred and fifty pounds you were good enough to pay Madame Rogandi, and I 'm very much obliged to you for what you did. You acted like a gentleman.' ' The thing is not worth a thanks,' faltered Paul, colouring deeply, and feeling as if he would rather anyone on earth had paid him this money than Sir Giles. ' I was in hopes that ' ' That the thing would not have reached our ears,' said Sir Giles, finishing his sentence. 'Well, you may make your mind easy, for Miss Carew knows nothing about it, and shall not if I can help it. It was Lady Hartleigh who told"], [112, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 102 me, venomous young vixen ! She hears of everything, and has a finger in everybody's pie. I suppose you know that it is she who has given that ass, Pottinger, the money to buy this plaguey piece of ground, so that she may damage the Carews, and get the races held in her park.' ' Nonsense ! are you in sober earnest ? ' asked Paul, dismayed. ' Yes, earnest as nails, and you'll live to see that it was a pretty present you made poor Hartleigh when you shoved Nell Lees into his arms ; but that's not to the purpose, and if we remain jawing here, that pair of fell-hounds will be signing some compact and outwitting us. Just start off as fast as you can, offer that d \u2014 blessed grocer his own terms, and I'll wait here till you come back. You don't object to smoking ? ' The black pipe had been produced before Paul could give an opinion as to whether he objected to have the fine purple curtains of his study perfumed with cut-cavendish. He went out, without having dared to look once fully into Sir Giles's face, for fear he should meet his eye and read in some humorous twinkle therein that the baronet had not forgotten the affair of the photograph. When the Vicar was gone, Sir Giles ensconced himself in an arm-chair, stirred the fire, and devoted himself to the pe rusal of the advertisements for lost dogs in the"], [113, "BENEFICIAL DOINGS. 103 Times' supplement. But soon this literary oc cupation proving too tedious for his restless state of mind, he rose and paced up and down the room, cursing the grocer, Pottinger, by his gods."], [114, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 104 CHAPTER XXVIII. REVELATIONS. Mr. Pottinger and his friend from London had been seen to walk out together in the direction of Royster, so Paul ascertained from the appren tice at the shop. He posted after them, but on reaching ' Stubb's Piece ' saw nothing but the board which Mr. Pottinger had recently set up, and which intimated that trespassers would be prosecuted with the utmost rigour of the law. Just beyond the limits of ' Stubb's Piece ' rose the Grand Stand, desolate edifice over whose empty tiers of benches the winds careered in howling steeple-chases during three hundred and sixty-two days out of the twelvemonth. Against the iron railings of the enclosure leaned a bumpkin boy in soiled smock and greasy wide-awake, munching bread and cheese, and keeping half an eye on some of Sir Peter's sheep, grazing on their owner's portion of the land. ' Heigh there, boy !' halloed Paul. ' Yoicks, zur ! ' was the reply."], [115, "REVELATIONS. 105 ' See-een two gentlemen about here ? ' ' Oi can't hear what yer zay.' ' Two-o ME-EN, one with a long COAT ? ' ' Gone down t' ro-oad a matter o' arf a hour ago; out Gad's Hill way; that's wheer they's a-gone ; ' so squalled the boy. Off went Paul towards Gad's Hill. He ought to have grudged the time he was wasting in this fashion, for he was expecting Mrs. Ful mouth's boys down that day, and had arranged to go to the station and meet them ; but Sir Giles had casually mentioned that Miss Carew, as well as her father, was very anxious about this land affair, and this was enough for him. Anything and anywhere for Amy's sake. The roads should not seem too long, nor the winds too bleak, nor the winter landscape too dreary, so long as he was on an errand which might bring the least satisfaction to her. But whither had they vanished, this pair of men who had disappeared as unaccountably as pence through a drain ? Though the pursuer put his best feet foremost and scanned the hori zon as searchingly as if he were keeping watch on a ship's deck, though he interrogated urchins and raised the latches of cottage doors, to ques tion women with their arms deep immersed in soap-suds, he could get no sight either of Pot tinger or of Rodgie. To try and track a man up Fleet Street at midday would be a hopeless"], [116, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 106 game enough, but one might expect to ascertain the whereabouts of a couple of elephants, whom one had heard of as having passed through Temple Bar but half an hour ago ; and in country roads, two men wearing the garb of urban civilisation are scarcely less conspicuous than a pair of elephants in town. However, Paul trudged on, through lane and highway, and at last under the creaking signboard of a roadside, Chequers' Inn, saw what appeared to be a black pillar, emitting smoke from a hole near the top. It was Mr. Rodgie in his ulster, enjoying a cigar. He was alone, though, and a questioning call for Pottinger uttered as soon as Paul was within hail only evoked a shake of the head, and a jerk of the Londoner's thumb in the direction of the North Pole, as if the grocer had suddenly forsaken kith and kin to seek the north-west passage. On accosting Mr. Rodgie, Paul was told that he and Mr. Pottinger had parted twenty minutes before, the grocer going back to Stilborough, whence he would probably be starting by the next train for London, in order to attend to some business there. ' However,' added the dye manufacturer, as he conveyed this dispiriting intelligence, and fillipped a long white ash from his cigar, ' If you have come to talk to him about \" Stubb's Piece \" you may address your remarks to me, as the land is mine."], [117, "REVELATIONS. 107 I gave Pottinger my draft an hour ago, and I have his written transfer ready for the convey ancer.' Paul confessed this was bad news to him. He had hoped to be in time to prevent a sale from which he augured little good. He was also the bearer of better terms than those which the grocer had presumably obtained. The Lon doner laughed. ' You have no fancy for seeing your town converted into a manufacturing city, Mr. Rush brand. You take no account of what grand additions there would be to your surplice fees ? ' ' Perhaps not,' said Paul, ' your description of the institution that was to spring up at your beck was enough to put one out of conceit even with personal cares.' ' And had you full power to treat with Pot tinger as to the ransom of this land ? ' asked Mr. Rodgie, smiling sagaciously. ' If so, I might say : supposing you treat with me ? Just come inside this inn where we shall be in pri vate,' but as he saw Paul hesitate to enter what was nothing better than a low stingo-shop, he added, ' Oh, it's a very decent place, and there are no other customers there ; their liquors are detestable, but you needn't compromise your cloth or stomach by drinking any.' The two had to stoop so as to enter the house without knocking their hats against the"], [118, "108 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. low doorway. They passed through a mean bar with a deal counter, and some shelves covered with grey-coloured crockery measures with broad blue borders. Turning to the left, the Londoner showed the way into a taproom with sanded floor, and a low grimy ceiling crossed by a beam. Some stools, two Windsor arm-chairs, and a beer-stained table composed the furniture, and in guise of ornament there was papered on the wall the highly tinted pro gramme of a strolling circus. A fire \u2014 so to call it \u2014 though it revealed no flicker of flame, filled the chimney with yellow smoke, and the atmosphere was heavy with the odour of stale tobacco and stale beer mingling with the steam of boiled cabbage coming from some regions at the back. A slatternly wench, putting her head in at the door, asked if anything were wanted ; being answered in the negative, she slunk away and was no more seen. Neither of the gentlemen sat down, but the Londoner looking hard at Paul, said in a low-pitched confidential tone : \u2014 ' Look here, our bargaining will be very short if you like it to be so. Will you solemnly swear to me that not a word of what passes between us shall be made known to Pottinger, unless, and until, you and I shall have come to terms together ? ' ' If you would not believe my simple word"], [119, "REVELATIONS. 109 you would be wrong to trust my oath,' replied Paul, calmly. ' I never swear lightly.' ' Will you promise then ? ' asked Mr. Rod gie, and again he looked intently at the Vicar : ' Yes, yours is a face to be relied on. Well, just glance at this,' and he produced a bit of something that looked like coal. Paul took it and tried it between his fingers ; it was brittle and broke into thin slabs like slate. The colour was rusty-black and lus treless. 'It's Boghead-mineral,' said he, 'out of which they distil paraffine and naphtha.' ' So it is, you know all about it then ? ' exclaimed the Londoner, apparently surprised that a clergyman should have any knowledge beyond theology. ' Well, \" Stubb's Piece,\" and the whole of the Carew estate covers a mine of this stuff, and the long and short of it is that, if Sir Giles Taplow wants to redeem \" Stubb's Piece,\" he must give me five and twenty thou sand pounds for it.' ' That is a large sum,' said Paul, though he was startled by the communication just made. ' It's less than I ought to ask for it,' returned the Londoner, 'and he shouldn't have it for that if I could have carried out my plan, which was to buy up the whole of the Carew property. You see I have had my eyi for a good while"], [120, "110 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. past on \"Stubb's Piece.\" I first came down here two years ago with the idea of setting up dye- works as you've heard, and then it was that an accident, resulting in some experiments with which I need not trouble you, made me ac- quainted with the nature of all that soil under the race-course. It's no wonder that the Carews should never have discovered what a fund of wealth they had under their feet, for they're an easy-going family, who have lived on the same estate for centuries, without ever troubling themselves to bore deeper than was necessary to set the foundations of some new conservatory or cottage, and you must bore deeper than that to get at this mineral.' 'Is it all as rich in oil as this?' inquired Paul, who had been closely examining the specimen. ' Every inch of it is up to that sample,' answered Mr. Rodgie, decisively ; ' and what is more the bed extends to something like a mile in all directions from Royster Hall, which stands almost in the very centre of what will be the future colliery. How I come to be so sure of my facts is my secret. It didn't suit my book to proclaim what I had discovered before the land was mine, so I caused my soundings and explorations to be conducted sub rosd. As I've told you, my original plan was to buy up Sir Peter Carew's estate, and, indeed, I may as well"], [121, "REVELATIONS. 111 own that I had a small hand in forcing Sir Peter's creditors to badger him, so that his embarrassments might induce him to hearken favourably to the proposals which I purposed to make him.' ' Perhaps it was you who urged that London milliner, Madame Rogandi, to take the extraor dinary course which she did ? ' said Paul, look ing with sudden distrust at his interlocutor. ' Madame Rogandi is a friend of mine,' responded the Londoner, with a cool nod, which showed that he perfectly understood what was being alluded to. ' But, my dear Mr. Rush brand, business is business, and we mustn't dally with precious time. My idea of getting the Carew estate necessarily collapsed when I heard that Sir Giles was going to marry one of the young ladies, and had set about paying the father's debts. That's the reason why I am willing to sell \" Stubb's Piece.\" Since I cannot have the whole mine, and become a millionnaire by its means, why I'm content to be paid out of the concern altogether for 25,000/., which is a snug little sum that I shall have earned without much trouble.' So speaking, Mr. Rodgie glanced at Paul for an answer, but the Vicar was in dire per plexity. Evidently it would be a great thing to get Sir Peter restored to the possession of the land he so much coveted, especially as now"], [122, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 112 there could be no more talk of using such pre cious soil for a race-course ; nevertheless, the affair looked suspiciously like a scheme for defrauding Pottinger. If that unsuspecting grocer had parted with the land at a low price in ignorance of its real value, would not Paul be to some extent abetting a swindle if he joined in procuring for the buyer such afar higher sum than that which he had paid ? Commercial morality said ' no,' for that Paul was but a dis interested agent in the business, and that besides to purchase an article for a very small sum, and sell it for a very big one was no swindle, but the very a b c of trade ; common good feeling, how ever, suggested to the scrupulous clergyman that this affair was coated with pitch, and that he could not touch it without dirtying his fingers. His first impulse was to tell Mr. Rodgie to go and settle the bargain for himself with Sir Giles Taplow ; but a man does not escape moral responsibility who stands by' and lets others perform unhindered a transaction in which he scrupled to have a share himself. Every person is bound to try and prevent the accomplishment of a thing which he disapproves, and as the thing disapproved of in this case was the fleecing of Pottinger, Paul remarked that he thought Mr. Rodgie ought to be satisfied with less than 25,000/., and honourably present the grocer with the balance."], [123, "REVELATIONS. 113 But this virtuous proposal moved the facile mirth of the Londoner, and procured Paul an ironical compliment on his ignorance of the ways of men. ' Why the smug rogue has al ready got seven hundred and fifty pounds more than he has any right to,' laughed Mr. Rodgie, ' and he is chuckling at this identical moment at the thought that he has picked a plum or two out of Lady Hartleigh's fruit-basket. If any body is wronged it is Lady Hartleigh to whom the land of right belongs, or rather her husband, with whose money it was purchased on the sly. But as neither my lord nor my lady bought the land as a speculation, and as they are mightily well off besides, the prejudice caused them is nil \u2014 ' and hereupon Mr. Rodgie let out all the particulars of his transaction with Mr. Pottinger, and of the latter's with the mistress of Hazel wood \u2014 Paul listening to these revelations with astonishment and disgust. ' What a world it is ! ' he ejaculated, with a sigh. ' Mr. Pottinger is the last man whom I should have deemed capable of such double dealing.' However, since now his scruples had no longer anything to feed on, he promised to carry Mr. Rodgie's proposals to Sir Giles, and, upon this understanding, moved towards the door. ' Very well, but mind that sharp is the motto in this business,' answered the Londoner, airily, VOL. II. i"], [124, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 114 as he lit a fresh cigar. ' Sir Giles must let me know categorically before to-morrow whether he will treat with me or not ; for if the matter is delayed, it will reach Pottinger's ears, and he'll be trying to upset our agreement in a law court. I only let the cat out of the bag to you, because I have the fullest confidence in your integrity \u2014 and eh there ! mind, again, I'll not take a penny less than five and twenty thousand.' Paul nodded, finding nothing more to say, and the two sallied out. They parted, without shaking hands, at the door, and the Vicar, glad to be rid of the interview, strode off briskly for Stilborough. He had already been absent more than an hour and a half, and he wondered whether Sir Giles would have had the patience to wait for him so long. Sir Giles had waited, but not by any means with patience, for anxiety of any sort sat as uneasily on his mind as a cat on \"horseback. After smoking his first pipe, examining the prints on the study walls, the motley collection of books on the shelves, and the addresses of the letters that lay on the writing-table ; after beating the devil's tattoo on a pane, ringing for more coals and frightening the housemaid who answered the bell thinking it was her master's summoni-S, and started with a stifled scream on beholding a 'stranger alone in the study ; after"], [125, "REVELATIONS. 115 counting the number of teeth in his head, of buttons on his boots, of gilded nails on a chair head, and after trying unsuccessfully (because of deficiency in the melodious faculty) to whistle a tune, Sir Giles lit a second pipe, and presently a third \u2014 after which, having rendered the room uninhabitable, he sauntered out, leaving the door wide open, and went out to get a breath of fresh air in the portico. As he stood here, with his hands in his pockets, casting his eye towards the High Street, the postman came up. He was a new man but recently installed, and did not know Sir Giles Taplow. Thinking him to be a resident at the Vicarage, he touched his cap, and handed him a letter directed to the Vicar ; and Sir Giles, thinking the letter was for himself, or rather not thinking at all about it, but obeying a merely mechanical instinct, broke the envelope, and read the first lines of a letter written on many pages of the thinnest foreign paper : \u2014 Shanghai. ' My dear young friend, \u2014 I shall probably return to England by the first packet after that which will carry this letter to you ; neverthe less, I did not, like to delay in answering the kind communication which you sent out to China on the chance of its finding me. It did find me, as you perceive, for British missionaries 1 2"], [126, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 116 are not so numerous here as to make it impos sible for the postal authorities to trace them. I rejoice greatly at your having been appointed to the Vicarage of Stilborough, and am touched by the providential hazard which led you to make acquaintance with my unhappy daughter ' ' Hullo, this isn't for me,' muttered Sir Giles when he had perused thus far, and he turned over several leaves till he had found the signa ture : ' Truman ! By Jove, it's from Nell Hart leigh's father ! ' he cried. But having made this discovery, he did not restore the letter to its envelope. He returned to the smoky study, stationed himself near the window for fear of surprises, and read straight on. Long as the letter was, he skipped nothing of it \u2014 not even prolix passages wherein the reverend writer indulged in recitals concerning his missionary labours, and humbly congratu lated himself on the numbers of Chinese whom he had converted from the paths of Confucius, rat-soup, and pig-tails. When he had reached the end he turned the envelope over and saw that it was too much torn to admit of its being re-sealed and laid on the table, so he thrust both it and the letter into his pocket. ' Bah ! ' said he, ' when the pair meet and Truman al ludes to his letter, they'll think it was a mis carriage.'"], [127, "REVELATIONS. 117 There was a diabolically malicious gleam in his blear eyes as he added to himself : \u2014 ' This is a windfall.

BOUGHT AND SOLD. Paul arrived breathless, and apologised for the length of his absence, but this done, he very soon delivered his errand, and Sir Giles stared. The staring and gaping of a Bashan bull was as nothing beside that of the owner of Taplow Court, when he was introduced to the bit of Boghead-mineral, and learned what profitable things can be done with its oil. It would be superfluous to report the con versation in which Paul descanted on the manu facture of paraffine oil, naphtha, and the solid paraffine out of which composite candles are moulded. Enough that Sir Giles learned how that, from a mine extensive as that which Mr. Rodgie professed to have discovered, an in come of 100,000/. might be turned, or more. It was a picture to watch cupidity kindle in his glance as he fingered the coal with the vacant look of wonderment peculiar to dolts when con templating an invention or any common object from which money can be made."], [129, "BOUGHT AND SOLD. 119 The only point that troubled him was to know whether Mr. Rodgie's word could be re lied on. It would never do to part with 25,000/. without being convinced by borings performed under his own eyes, that the land was worth the price set upon it. Paul had neglected to ask the Londoner whether he would consent to experiments being made ; but he supposed there would be no difficulty about that, and advised Sir Giles to go over himself to the Red Lion and see Mr. Rodgie, who would in all likelihood be there by this time. ' Yes, I will,' said Sir Giles, and went. He did not ask Paul to go with him, for he was already much vexed that there was any third sharer in the secret, which he would have liked to keep close between Rodgie and himself. The heart is sometimes more honest than the lip, and provokingly stamps the seal of its rec titude on the unwilling cheek. If Paul had watched his visitor more narrowly, he would have noticed that his features were overspread with a burning flush \u2014 outward manifestation of some very queer thoughts which had begun to bubble in his pate at the first sight of the piece of coal, and which were now hard boiling there. Sir Giles, on quitting the vicarage, did not go straight to the hotel. He stopped at the chemist's, and showed his mineral to Mr. Nibbs,"], [130, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 120 pretending that it was a sample of some coal that had been sent him by a London merchant, and which would not burn like the rest, so that he was anxious to know whether it was coal at all. Mr. Nibbs easily identified the substance as being like that which is found at Bathgate, in Linlithgowshire, and the account which he furnished as to its properties tallied so accu rately with everything that Paul had said, that the baronet's heart thumped against his waist coat. It is the characteristic of small minds to be exceedingly prompt at suspecting that they are being imposed upon, but to take only the most puerile precautions to prevent themselves from being outwitted ; in the which they differ from great minds who are slow to suspect, but who when once their suspicions are aroused, in vestigate the objects of their mistrust thoroughly. Sir Giles was quite pleased with his sharpness in having gone to the chemist's, and felt that an intellect so vigilant as his was not likely to get trapped into a delusive bargain. Mr. Rodgie, with his bland, collected man ners, was just the man to impress him favour ably. He readily consented to an exploration, but pointed out that before any public borings could be ventured upon, he must legally ratify his bargain with Mr. Pottinger, lest the latter should recede from it ; moreover, he would not pledge himself that in the meantime he should"], [131, "BOUGHT AND SOLD. 121 not try and obtain a better price than 25,000/., by offering the land to some paraffine company already existent, for money was money and always sweet to the tooth. This did not suit Sir Giles at all. Considering that the races might, by judicious management, be made to yield Sir Peter Carew 1,000/. a year, 'Stubb's Piece ' was worth 20,000/. to him, even with no coal underneath ; and it was surely a prudent speculation to invest an extra 5,000/. on the chance of getting a piece of land that might fetch 30,000/. a year ; for such, according to Mr. Rodgie, would be the yield of ' Stubb's Piece ' alone. The Londoner drew towards him a sheet of paper, and worked out a calculation, imparting as he did so a variety of geological information to his hearer. What with blue lias, London clay, calcareous formation, shark's teeth and tufa, the baronet's head whirred, nor did it tend to his composure that he perceived Mr. Rodgie was gradually working himself into a state of enthusiasm respecting the prize he had gotten. Sir Giles saw the moment when this enthusiasm might transcend safe limits, so he professed himself prematurely enlightened by the figures thrust before him, and hastened to conclude : \u2014 ' All right \u2014 I know I can rely on your word,' he said nervously. 'Well, I'll give you the 25,000/.'"], [132, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 122 ' H'm, I don't know that I ought to do it at that price,' said the Londoner, with a regretful look at his reckoning. ' My friends in town would call me a pretty flat if they heard I had parted with the income of a lord for a paltry five and twenty thou'.' ' Well, but you can't be quite sure about the mineral, so you won't make a bad thing out of a mere spec'.' ' If I were not quite sure about what I am selling you, Sir Giles, I should not ask such a sum for it ; nor should I risk my word of honour as I have done.' ' Ahem, of course, I beg pardon,' stammered Sir Giles, quite won by this dignified integrity. ' No, the true and only reason of my willing ness to sell is that I have enough on my hands with my Dye-works company in London,' con tinued Mr. Rodgie, laying down his pen. ' I suppose you don't feel much interest in dyes, Sir Giles. I've taken out a patent for a new process, which will give us back the splendid purple dyes of the ancients ; and I think I'm on the track of rediscovering the medi\u00e6val method of staining glass, which was lost about the end of the fifteenth century. Curious, isn't it, that inventions should get lost in that way ? There are the Cremona fiddles for instance ' ' Science is full of surprises,' rejoined Sir Giles, wisely, ' but h'm, if you'll hand me that"], [133, "BOUGHT AND SOLD. 123 pen I think we can put our business in black and white.' ' Very well, since you have made up your mind to it, but it will be only fair to me to set the price at thirty thousand.' ' No, no, five and twenty,' exclaimed Sir Giles, in a fright. ''Gad, sir, I've been spend ing money of late to an extent you couldn't dream of. I'm sailing under such a press of canvas that, if I don't take care, I shall capsize.' ' Well, well, I won't be extortionate, but you'll pay for the stamps and legal fees of the transfer ? ' Sir Giles gave an affirmative grunt. His pen was already gliding over a leaf of his cheque book, and soon the pair had exchanged signatures. They parted on a mutual promise to keep their tongues tightly sealed to the roofs of their mouths for fear of Pottinger. The greater part of the ensuing fortnight was spent in the troublesome and always lengthy formalities which the law has devised for putting money into the pockets of solicitors whenever a portion of the soil of Britain changes hands. The Royal Exchequer likewise holds out its claw for fees, and it had no reason to be dis satisfied with those which ' Stubb's Piece ' brought it within a very short space of time. First Pottinger had paid fees to buy the land from the Corporation ; next Rodgie disbursed"], [134, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 124 to purchase it from Pottinger ; lastly Sir Giles was to pay more fees to get the land from Rodgie. The understanding between Rodgie and the baronet was kept a profound secret. The grocer never suspected a moment that he was being trifled with, and put his signature to documents right merrily, under the belief that he had screwed very handsome sums out of the Londoner ; but when once the land had been made over to the latter beyond power of re covery, then Sir Giles slunk off to town to play his part in the new transfer. Mr. Rodgie did him the honours of the City, and took him to the handsome offices of the ' Murex Dye Works Company (Limited).' The baronet saw polished mahogany counters, polished brass railings, polished clerks. There was exhibited to him a pattern book, full of little squares of cloth and silk, dyed by the new process, and which looked very much like little squares of cloth and silk dyed by any other process ; but then one of the Company's highly glazed prospectuses was there to prove that the new process effected a saving of ever so much per cent, and that the shareholders could not fail shortly to make their fortunes all round. The respect paid to Mr. Rodgie by the clerks of the Company was most marked ; everything in short denoted the respectability of this gentleman, so that Sir Giles Taplow made no"], [135, "BOUGHT AND SOLD. 125 scruple to accept a dinner from him at a re- spectable West-end club to which he belonged. and to give him one in return at Poodles', whereof he himself was a member. They also went to the play together, and despite the procrastination of lawyers, Sir Giles contrived to enjoy himself in town, pursuant to the usual methods of country gentlemen when they come up to London for a holiday. At length the last signature and the last stamp were affixed to the last document that was requisite to put Sir Giles in possession of the land which he coveted, and our baronet, having lunched with Mr. Rodgie in honour of this event, found himself at liberty to go whither- soever he would. Christmas was fast approach- ing, and the afternoon was steeped in one of those fine pea-soupey fogs which instil a desire for a cosy dinner beside a good fire, rather than for a railway journey. Sir Giles postponed his departure for the country till the morrow, and turned into his hotel, Limmer's, where he was sure to get the sort of dinner he wanted, and good company to season it withal ; for a man of any position, especially one addicted to sport, could hardly stand half an hour in Limmer's coffee-room without being accosted by an acquaintance. Providence so ordained it that Oswald Carew was in the coffee-room, sitting opposite the fire,"], [136, "126 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. with his boots on the fender, his hands in his pockets, and his eyes watching the faces in the coals very moodily. No encounter could have been more satisfactory to Sir Giles, for he had not seen Amy's eldest brother for a good while \u2014 not indeed since the Karetkine affair, Oswald having kept away from home since then. He wore the bitter look of one to whom life is no longer a pleasure, and told Sir Giles that he had been spending a fortnight at Nice, and had won 500/ off the roulette at Monaco. Naturally Sir Giles invited him to dine at his table, and while the repast was in course of preparation, and while the two friends were whetting their appe tites with peculiarly dry sherry and bitters, he related how he had just bought back ' Stubb's Piece ' for the ' swinging figure' of 25,000/. But he said not a word about the paraffine mineral ; on the contrary, he feigned to have only given the ' swinging price ' with a view to getting the long-harried race question definitely settled to Sir Peter's advantage. ' It's very kind of you, that's all I can say,' remarked Oswald, with a seriousness which Sir Giles had never noticed in him before. ' But I have been wanting to have a talk with you about the many things you have been doing for us. You know we can't be accepting all these sums of money as gifts ; ' and he turned to look his sister's betrothed in the face."], [137, "BOUGHT AND SOLD. 127 ' What, not from a brother-in law ! ' exclaimed Sir Giles, with a show of bluff good fellowship, and patting Oswald on the shoulder. ' I don't forget that you are going to marry my sister, and I take it as natural that you should wish to see your wife's relatives out of quandary,' said Oswald ; ' but that is no reason why you should throw away cartloads of money, in order to stack up an income for me. If you have no objection we will look upon the sums you have paid for us as loans.' ' Loans ? what an idea ! ' ' It's an idea that I shall have to insist on,' replied Oswald, gently but firmly. ' \" Stubb's Piece \" is your own now, and it strikes me we had better make over to you all the remainder of the race-course, getting its value appraised, and setting it off against the debt we owe you. And for the balance of the debt, say we give you a mortgage on the rest of the property ? The estate is entailed, but I will settle with my father about having the entail cut off' Now although Sir Giles made a nobly dis interested gesture, as if he could not brook any such an idea as that just enounced, Oswald's proposal, or something equivalent to it, was exactly what he had intended to man\u0153uvre for. From the moment he had ascertained that there was a fortune in ' Stubb's Piece ' he had resolved to buy it for himself, which was only natural ;"], [138, "128 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. but he had likewise resolved to get to himself as much more of Sir Peter's land as he could, without informing the owner as to its value, which was perhaps equally natural, but not quite so honourable. Sir Giles, however, having recklessly and munificently disbursed, whilst he thought there was no chance of his being repaid, considered himself entitled to an ample reward for his sacrifices, now that fortune had stepped in to convert all things into gold under his touch. The prospect of doubling or trebling his income had reawakened his innate love of money, and after all, thought he, since, but for the relief he had given, Sir Peter would have been wheedled into parting with his whole estate for a song, it was only fair that he, Sir Giles, should get his good share of the discovered booty. That which would remain to Sir Peter would still be ample enough in all conscience. Oswald Carew, believing Sir Giles's disinte restedness to be genuine, took some trouble to argue him into submissiveness to his dictates. It could not but be a matter of secret amazement to him, that one whom he had known so close fisted should suddenly have blossomed into a Bayard of generosity ; but he had witnessed metamorphoses yet stranger than this to be ac complished by love, and the explanation which he gave to himself was that Sir Giles's passion for Amy ran to the utmost lengths of ' spooniness.'"], [139, "BOUGHT AND SOLD. 129 So far as he was himself concerned he did not like Sir Giles, and was loth to be overmuch beholden to him. The unjust aspersions that had been cast upon himself, with reference to the Karetkine affair, had made him more par ticular than he had ever been in his life in regard of money matters, and it speaks not a little for his self-control that he had not touched a card since the fatal evening with the Russian. He had won at roulette, but that was at a public table, when he risked breaking no man's heart by his winnings. He had sworn to himself that under no circumstances would he ever again play at any game for money with a friend, nor at cards at all, whether for money or not. So he took up very dignified ground with Sir Giles, and by the time the obsequious head waiter had brought a steaming tureen on to the best corner-table, and had set in proximity to it a grand' marque bottle of old Madeira, Oswald had talked the baronet over ; insomuch that they adjourned from the fireside to their dinner, having agreed between them as to all that was to be done. Sir Giles (very reluctantly) would allow the whole of the race-course to be made over to him in extinction of a part of his debt, and all the race-receipts should be his ; but as to the other portion of the debt, he insisted that it might be considered simply as money lent, without other security than that of I.O.U's., VOL. II. K"], [140, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 130 payable within \u2014 say ten years. What was the use of troubling Sir Peter to fork out yearly in terest for money advanced for the family good by his own son-in-law ? Whenever the old man or his heirs might be in a position to pay, Sir Giles would accept their money with a\" ' thank you,' but if the hour of reimbursement never dawned, he was not likely to make a fuss about it, and consequently mortgaging would be an unnecessary and idle formality. Thus spoke the baronet in the fulness of his heart, and Oswald, for his father's sake rather than for his own, gave assent to arrangements which seemed to him fraught with so much kindness and delicacy. ' Well but, Ossie, you've not told me yet what you mean to do with yourself,' said Sir Giles, when turbot with Dutch sauce had been placed before him. ' Have your duns stopped barking ?' ' Yes, thanks to you the whole pack have become dumb-mad. I parted the price of my commission among them ; it was gulped down like a sop, but that's all they want for the pre sent. By the bye, when is the wedding day ? ' ' Amy has not fixed it yet, but I hope it won't be many weeks after New Year's Day,' said Sir Giles, winking as a certain class of squires delight to do at all allusions to wed dings. ' But mind, we expect you down ; there must be no skulking in London on that day.'"], [141, "BOUGHT AND SOLD. 131 ' I shall be present, of course. But I asked you the date so as to make my arrangements in consequence. After the wedding, I shall pro bably leave England for some time.' ' What nonsense ! Where should you go to ? ' ' I've not made up my mind, except to the fact that after all this recent bobbery I shall be better out of England than in it. I miss my regimental work more than I should have thought possible. Every time I meet a soldier I hang my head, by Gad, and feel something like a throb at the heart. I must do something for occupation and a living ; and think I shall join that expedition of Frenchmen who are going out to the Tierra del Fuego ' ' To murder the natural owners of the soil and rob them,' grinned Sir Giles. ' Everything is susceptible of being stated in two ways,' answered Oswald quietly. ' Any how what I want is a life of activity with a strong spice of danger ; and some prospect, however faint, of profit. Crossing over from Calais the other night, I fell in on board the packet with a very decent old fellow, a mis sionary who had been to China, and who gave me such accounts of the place as to make me rather wish to be out there.' ' What was your friend's name ? ' ' I don't know ; we exchanged cards, but I have mislaid his. He seemed to think that a K 2"], [142, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 132 good deal might be done in China by a man who had the pluck to go into the heart of the country and trade honestly.' ' I fancy I see you strolling about the tea fields with a pedlar's pack on your back, Ossie, and a heathen Chinee wife at your heels,' laughed Sir Giles. ' Why don't you marry an Englishwoman, man, and stick to the old coun try. Lady Ambermere would be delighted to have you ' ' I asked her once, and she sent me to the rightabout,' said Oswald, frankly. ' A woman's \"No\" means \" Yes,\" ' remarked Sir Giles, as if he knew a good deal about it. ' How do they set to work when they mean no, then ? ' retorted Oswald, good-humouredly. ' At all events, matrimony is a craft which I have never been madly anxious to sail in.' ' Stuff, man, you'll change your mind, and here's my health to you,' ejaculated the baronet, raising his glass to his lips. ' What's more, I don't advise you to leave England : you may turn up a fortune here when you least expect it' ' A fortune in England ? Doubtful.' ' Who knows ?

POTTINGER AT BAY. Christmas week was come, and the shops in Stilborough displayed preparations for the high feeding incumbent on that festive season. Goose clubs were announced by cards in public-house windows ; whole oxen with sheets of their in side-fat cut into tasteful patterns like Brussels lace, hung decked in pink and blue ribbons ; the mortality among turkeys and pigs, as evidenced by the number of their carcases on show at the poulterer's and porkbutcher's, was such as must have inspired any surviving porker or turkey cock of reflective mind with misgivings anent the extermination of his species ; and as to the grocer's windows, when you halted opposite Pottinger's, for instance, you beheld a shop front converted into one vast tank of mince meat, whose surface was studded with sprigs of holly, rings of candied orange and lemon peel, and smart boxes of sweetmeats, with portraits of distinguished persons on their lids. Christ mas was a busy season for Mr. Pottinger, both"], [144, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 134 as grocer, mayor, and churchwarden, for all those portions of his mind which were not ab sorbed by the retailing of edibles, were eaten up with cares as to distribution of the funds and gifts of divers charities, of which he was ex officio a manager. Now in the dispersing of these coals, warm petticoats, doles of money, orders for tea, beef, and what not, he was brought a good deal into contact with the Vicar, and he was not long in noticing that Paul had grown cold towards him. When the fact began to insinuate itself into his perceptions, he thought there must be some mistake about it, but closer watching did but confirm first impressions. There was an un deniable, pronounced shade of coolness in Paul's language and manners. To what business they had to transact in company, the Vicar brought to bear his usual diligence and civility, but there was no chatting about commonplaces when business was over, no prefatory comments on the weather, none of those smiles that facilitate the smooth gliding of work, as little puffs of wind do the swift sailing of a yacht. Sheepishly the grocer asked himself what this could mean. Had he offended ? Had he done aught which, reaching the Vicar's ears, could become liable to misconstruction ? but his conscience acquitted him, for it never entered his mind that Mr. Rodgie could have betrayed"], [145, "POTTINGER AT BAY. 135 that little secret of the 750/., nor could he sur mise that Paul was vexed with him for having been so unaccommodating with Sir Giles Taplow. It was no hidden thing to the grocer that the Vicar and Sir Giles were not on terms of warm reciprocal affection, and there seemed to him no chance that the latter would care hotly to es pouse the former's quarrels. Nevertheless a man, whose conscience is not altogether clean, will not dare to solve a doubt of this nature by going boldly to the person who has frowned on him and asking the reason of this coldness, wherefore the grocer chewed the cud of his mortification silently. One day he had just relieved his mind of a great burden of eleemosynary blankets, and had left the town-hall for the vestry, there to inspect some books which gave a list of the claimants to the yearly bounty of one Hubble, who, in the year 1550, had bequeathed to ten old men and as many women id. a piece, to buy them firing through the winter (fuel being a trifle cheaper then than now). Opposite the church he saw the Carews' break, and looking in through the church doors, which stood wide open, he lighted upon a pretty sight : a number of ladies and boys putting up the Christmas decorations under the Vicar's superintendence. Mr. Pottinger's daughter Patty was there ; so were all the ladies from Royster Hall, and a"], [146, "136 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. good many others from the neighbourhood, with their brothers, and all the available young men who liked to combine ecclesiastical ornamenta tion with flirting. In the time of the worldly minded vicars, Paul's predecessors, it had be come an annual custom for the ladies of the parish to meet on a certain day to hang up the floral adornments they had prepared, and after wards to lunch at the vicarage. Paul, having been apprised of this usage, had said he would conform to it ; and there he was on the altar steps with a garland of evergreens in his hands, and issuing orders to his fair troop as to where this chaplet, or wreath, or cross was to be hung. The ladies, obedient to his behests, clustered at the feet of sundry ladders, whereon young men were mounted, plying hammers on tin-tacks, or unrolling balls of coloured tape. There was a good deal of discreet gaiety, and the church was fragrant with the odour of laurel and fresh gathered holly. Mr. Pottinger felt shy about walking up the nave through this throng, and thought he would gain the vestry by going round through the churchyard. But this took him from Scylla into Charybdis, for he had scarcely turned the church tower than he stumbled upon Sir Peter and Sir Giles, with a group of several other gentlemen examining the moss-covered grave stones of the disused burying-place. A silence"], [147, "POTTINGER AT BAY. 137 arose as he appeared, and he coloured up to the ears ; but Sir Giles, who could not resist the pleasure of crowing over a vanquished foe, and who besides had his reasons for what he was about to say, cried in a pouncing way : \u2014 ' I say, Pottinger, who's the man who took his pigs to market and got sold ? ' ' I don't know, I'm sure, sir,' answered the grocer with an attempt at indifference, and he was about to pass on, but Sir Giles playfully barred his way by stretching out his stick. ' No, not so fast, Pottinger, you're not in a hurry, are you ? Tell us all what made you so plaguey anxious to get a dye-shop set up in our town ? ' ' Principle \u2014 nothing but that, sir,' answered the grocer, trying to speak smartly, like a man unabashed in the face of persecution. ' Your principles must be expensive things to keep, my friend ? ' ' I never count the cost of them, sir.' ' Ecod, you ought to then, else you'll find them like lazy horses eating more than they are worth. Shall I give you a little bit of news, Mr. Mayor ? \u2014 but first just look these gentle men in the face, and tell them for how much you bought \" Stubb's Piece,\" and at what price you sold it ? Speak out, man, but remember Ananias, who came to grief through a little"], [148, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 138 propensity, not uncommon I believe among churchwardens.' ' Sir Giles I beg you will let me pass,' cried Mr. Pottinger in a croaking voice, and scarlet as a poppy. ' What ! you're afraid I shall disclose some thing about the seven hundred and fifty pounds,' laughed Sir Giles. ' No fear, my good man. I consider you acted grandly, and no mistake, in being content with a profit of a few hundreds for the sake of selling to Rodgie; when by treating with me you might have got the same sum as he has done \u2014 namely, twenty-five thou sand pounds.' ' Twenty-five thous' ,' exclaimed the gro cer, as if his mouth had suddenly been forced open by an invisible wedge. ' That's the sum, sir,' said Sir Giles, enjoy ably turning the dagger in the stab which he had inflicted ; 'and, by Jove, how you must love Rodgie to have given him such a chance when you would have none of it yourself. Think of what you could have done with twenty-five thousand pounds, and think what he'll do ! And the worst of it is that your self-denial won't have benefited the anti-racing cause which you appear to have so much at heart, for Stilborough races will be held as usual in Royster Park ; and, indeed, we're going to see if we can't hold two meetings a year instead of"], [149, "POTTINGER AT BAY. 139 one. So you're pretty well sold, eh ! as the rat said to the cheese ? ' Mr. Pottinger's discomfiture was so legibly stamped on his face, and his arms had dropped so helplessly to his side, that the group of gen tlemen all burst out laughing. Even Sir Peter, who despised the man, could not refrain from joining in the merriment. The grocer furnished indeed a perfect picture of the rogue who has overreached himself; and, looking much more of a rogue than he really was, he stumbled away half giddy. As for Sir Giles Taplow, he had had his say, and was con tent. By constantly speaking about the races, and repeating that he had only given the high sum of 25,000/. to the sole end that the races might still be held at Royster, he hoped to dispel any suspicion that he had bought the land with some other end in view ; and thus when, having become owner of the entire race-course, he should order borings to be made under some pretext not yet invented, the discovery of coal would appear to be a happy accident, not the result of any previous knowledge. Mr. Pottinger pushed open the vestry door, and tottered to a chair like one inebriate. What he had heard was maddening. Basely betrayed by Rodgie, denounced to Sir Giles as a trickster, he would soon be held up to the whole town as a hypocrite, and where then should he hide his"], [150, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 140 diminished head? In the first moments of his consternation he thought only of his failure to wrest the races from Sir Peter, and of the scan dal that must arise if it became publicly known that his efforts in this direction had not been so disinterested as he had often, with such blatant vehemence, proclaimed. The chagrin at having failed to secure for himself the vast pile of money which Rodgie had gotten, did not immediately prick his soul ; it was destined to come upon him in its full force as an after-thought, punctur ing and rending him at all times of the day and night. Paul Rushbrand entering the vestry to seek for something, found the grocer with his throb bing head resting on his hands, quite over whelmed. ' Are you unwell, Mr. Pottinger ? ' he asked. ' Yes,' moaned the grocer, hoarsely. ' Have you heard what that fellow Rodgie has done ? ' ' I have,' answered Paul. Mr. Pottinger looked up and started to his feet. ' I am not to hunderstand, am I, that you've had any hand in this ugly job ; this, this? ' ' I advised Mr. Rodgie to sell the land which he bought of you to Sir Giles Taplow,' replied Paul, calmly ; ' and I am convinced that I acted quite rightly in ' ' In hiding the thing from me, in deceiving"], [151, "POTTINGER AT BAY. 141 me, in getting me plundered ! ' blurted out the grocer, unable to contain himself. ' Ah, it's a pretty bit of business you've done for a clergy man in taking the side of all those betting men and sharpers who thrive on the races.' ' You forget yourself, sir,' said Paul, with a cold, firm glance that was not without its effect upon the grocer. ' You never informed me that if the races ceased to be held at Royster, they would take place at Hazelwood, and you mis represented to me that you had bought the land with your own savings, instead of being, as you were, the tool of Lady Hartleigh, for motives of private malice rather than of public good.' ' I wasn't bound to betray her ladyship's con fidence to you, was I ? ' stuttered Mr. Pottinger, exasperated to find himself thus unmasked ; and as to motives, what did I know of hers ? She asked me to do this, and I did it to oblige her.' ' The woman tempted me and I did eat,' rejoined Paul, with a faint smile. ' That is an old excuse, Mr. Pottinger, and I should hardly have expected to meet with it on your lips. However, there is another very disagreeable feature in this case \u2014 a monetary one, which I need not particularise. Enough that your con duct has been a disappointment to me, who thought so well of you.' ' Come, come, I'm not going to be preached"], [152, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 142 at by you, Mr. Rushbrand,' cried the writhing grocer, from whose shoulders Paul's words seemed to strip the mantle of pious respectability which he had so long worn.

As you must understand that it would be impossible for me to have any continued relations with a person having forfeited any part of the confidence I had once placed in him, I hope you will see fit to resign your churchwardenship at the next Easter meeting.' ' Ah, that's the crowning blow,' exclaimed Mr. Pottinger, in a very howl of rage and hu miliation. 'And you think I'll stand it. No, I've long had my doubts about those thirty-nine articles, and I'LL JOIN THE BAPTISTS!'"], [153, "'43 CHAPTER XXXI. AMY GIVES THANKS. Amy Carew was fastening up a device over the communion table. She had drawn apart from her companions, in the hope that she might find herself for a moment alone with Paul, and return him her thanks for what he had done for her. In this did she yield to the impulse of mere gratitude, or was she prompted by that curious propensity of her sex to play with fire ? Did she want to judge by Paul's manner towards her, now that she was engaged, whether those words on the photograph referred to herself? Did she wish to see whether her betrothal to another man had diminished aught of the in tensity of love which those words suggested ? Questions difficult to answer in the case of \"a being so enigmatical as a girl. Anyhow, when Paul came out of the vestry, Amy coughed softly, and made as though she were unable to reach the rail on which her device ought to be hung. Immediately Paul stood by her side. She thanked him, and as she had climbed on"], [154, "144 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. to one of the altar chairs, he offered her his arm to assist her in descending. Even if that arm had not trembled under the light touch, the sud den downcastings of his eyes, which he had fixed full on hers, for the brief instant during which a man can bear to look at the sun, would have told Amy Carew all she wanted to know. Her colour went and came, and a thrill passed over her. ' Mr. Rushbrand \u2014 ' she said, intrepidly, feel ing that what she had to utter ought to be delivered at once ; but she stopped, for there was that provoking Miss Patty Pottinger, who, of a sud den, tripped. simpering up the chancel, wanting to know whether the font should be adorned or left plain ? Miss P. was always simpering, al ways wanting to know stupid things, and always tripping about wherever the Vicar happened to be. Such was already Amy Carew's experience of her, founded on one hour's visual acquaint anceship, and it betrayed itself by an impatient, but invisible, little stamp of Amy's foot, when the grocer's daughter, instead of taking her answer and departing, asked more and more questions, evidently with a view to coaxing Paul to come and minister in her train. She went away at last, but then it was the turn of the Misses Pettigrew, and after that of Miss Wigson and Miss Jollewether, with more and more simpering and stupid questioning, and"], [155, "AMY GIVES THANKS. 145 cajoling glances to Paul to come and help them. Evidently the Vicar was in request amongst his feminine parishioners, and Amy bit her lips. She remembered the last vicar, who, however friendly with people of his own station, knew so well how to hold at a distance those of ranks be neath him, and the thought flashed on her that all these shopkeeping young ladies would not have dared to be so familiar with Mr. Rushbrand had his birth and education not been so lowly. ' How tiresome girls are ! ' she exclaimed, when Miss Wigson had been dismissed with a compliment as to some wreaths of artificial roses, and went away smiling and tossing her curls. ' Between us all we shall drive you mad, Mr. Rushbrand.' ' Not a moody madness at all events,' he answered good-humouredly. ' Those young ladies have almost put out of my head what I wished to say to you,' she answered, speaking quickly.

' I consider it was all the kinder of you, Mr. Rushbrand, as at the time you rendered us that assistance we were in wretched circumstances, and seemed suddenly to have lost all our friends.' How bravely she spoke, and how well that mantling colour on her cheeks became her ! Paul's heart beat wildly, and his emotion did not allow of his speaking until some seconds after she had become silent. Even then his words seemed to him different to those which he would have uttered could he have mastered his tongue. ' I have not yet by word of mouth congratu lated you on your coming marriage,' he said. ' I have prayed, however, that you may be happy, and shall do so again and again very fervently.' ' Thank you,' she answered, with perhaps the faintest quaver in her voice. ' Sir Giles has been very good to us all. I cannot help think ing he has in a way saved papa's life, for I am sure papa would have fretted himself to death under the troubles that overwhelmed us a little time ago.'

' ' So I am told, and this makes me wonder that Sir Giles should have deferred a single hour to announce to Sir Peter the news of his marvellous good fortune.' They had moved a few steps during this dialogue, and Amy now stood in the centre of a broad patch of blue and red light, made by the sun's rays streaming through the stained glass of the east window. Her face was suffused with a glory of colour, but her brow was knit, and she looked down at the tesselated flooring, very pensive. She was reflecting that Sir Giles had been bestirring himself very actively during the last few days to get large transfers of land from Sir Peter, and that he had also accepted promissory notes to the full amount of the sums which he had lent. But not a word had he breathed as to the discovery of coal : he had acted as though the land which was being con- signed to him were only so much worthless ground which he was generously accepting in part payment of his dues in order to ease Sir Peter's honourable scruples about taking too large sums of money from him as gifts. ' Have you told anybody besides me of this, Mr. Rushbrand ? ' she inquired, abruptly look ing up. ' No \u2014 at least, let me think,' said Paul,"], [159, "AMY GIVES THANKS. 149 doubting whether he had informed Mr. Pot tinger.

' May I ask you not to mention the subject to anyone for the present ? ' requested Amy. ' Certainly, if you wish it.' ' Since Sir Giles has not spoken about it yet, I should like to leave him the pleasure of in forming us,' added she. ' Of course; that is quite natural,' answered Paul, admiring the kindliness implied by this wish. ' This,' thought he, with a sigh, ' is good ness, and womanly grace ! ' But he was able to speak no more with her for that time, seeing that Sir Peter's stalwart form was descried looming up the nave towards them. It was two o'clock, and the worthy baronet had put in an appearance as a reminder that it was luncheon-time. The church was soon cleared, and a gay, hungry party wended its way tt) the vicarage, there to partake of the feast on the preparing of which Mrs. Rushbrand had bestowed all that anxiety usual to the feel ings of a Frenchwoman on culinary occasions. Her guests had every reason to be satisfied with her catering. There was abundance for them all, though they were so numerous as to fill three large rooms ; and both viands and"], [160, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 150 wines were choice enough to have satisfied even the fastidious palates of Paul's predecessors. There was a tradition that on a similar celebra tion to this in the reign of one of the former popular vicars, a glazed frost had begun to fall whilst the ' whole town ' were at luncheon at the parsonage. As it was quite impossible to do so much as cross the road except on all fours, the ' whole town ' had to quarter themselves on the Vicar for dinner as well as luncheon, and for supper as well as dinner : in fact, they remained on his hands \u2014 or to speak by the card, on his larder and cellar \u2014 until the small hours, when a change of wind having melted the slippery coat ing on the roads, they were enabled to regain their homes. Although the cheerfulness where with the aforementioned vicar had broached dozen upon dozen of his best wines was become a by-word in Stilborough when men wished to talk of hospitality, yet Paul did virtually as much as he did, for the ' whole town ' in the times of former vicars had meant only the genteeler in habitants of it, whereas Paul had made no class distinctions, but had bidden all and as many as would come to the feast. This was a great treat to the tradesmen's daughters, who found themselves in delightful promiscuity with the Royster Hall ladies ; even Miss Patty Pottinger abandoned herself to the sweetness of lunching at the same table as Mrs. Warrener and Mrs."], [161, "AMY GIVES THANKS. 151 Hunt \u2014 all unsuspicious of the terrible blowing up that was going to greet her at home so soon as her father heard that she had accepted the hospitality of ' that man ' \u2014 ' that base clerical adder whom I had cherished in my bosom.' When the clattering of knives and forks had somewhat subsided at this grand table, Sir Peter Carew, raising a glass of excellent claret to his lips, glanced about him till his eyes fell on three boys who were sitting at the farther end and eating steadily. Two of them had lank, butter coloured hair, famished eyes, and lantern jaws ; the third, who sat between them, had his elbows on a level with his ears, and was pegging away at some game pie as if he had a train to catch. ' God bless my soul ! Isn't that Digby Popham ? ' ejaculated Sir Peter, hailing him. ' Digby, sir, what are you doing here ? ' ' Enjoying himself, I hope,' said Paul, with a smile. ' But he is my pupil.' ' Pupil, eh ? I didn't know you were going in for that kind of thing, Rushbrand.' ' Oh, he's doing this as a special favour for Lady Pompermore \u2014 she told me all about it,' cried out Sir Giles Taplow. ' But I say, Rushbrand, I've a bone to pick with you ; for the young 'un has just been telling me that you have forbidden him to come to Taplow Court, my society being demoralising.' ' The reason is of your own stating, Sir"], [162, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 152 Giles,' replied Paul, in a joking way. '/gave Digby none.' ' Boys are sharp though, and guess \u2014 Digby and I are old friends. You mustn't put us asunder.' ' I only want to keep him apart from your bull-dog and badgers,' laughed Paul, who could not snub a guest at his own table. ' Oh, all that is ancient history,' retorted Sir Giles. ' Ask that young lady opposite whether, since a \u2014 a certain \u2014 ahem ! \u2014 happy occasion, I have not become quite a reformed character.' The young lady opposite was Amy \u2014 and was it fancy that made Paul think that she responded to her lover's interpellation with a smile that was very cold indeed \u2014 so cold that its chilliness radiated right across the table to where Sir Giles sat, and made him sit for an instant open-mouthed, like one whose speech has been frozen at its source ?"], [163, "\u00bb53 CHAPTER XXXII. LADY HARTLEIGH's VAGARIES. Mr. Pottinger had fled to his shop in a tumult of alarm and wrath. He had too many enemies in the town not to know that the faintest breath against his fair fame would soon be fanned into a high wind by those who were jealous of his recent prosperity ; and for this cause his threat to secede from the Established Church was not an idle one. The ranks of Dissent have ever been largely recruited from among those who have quarrelled with the ministers of the Estab lishment. A Frenchman, who falls out with the authorities of his country, turns Republi can ; an Englishman of the lower middle class, who has had words with his clergyman, and who failed to get the best of it, immediately conceives doubts as to the baptism of infants and the godliness (or ' gaudliness ') of eccle siastical vestments. Let it not be supposed, though, that Mr. Pottinger meant to slink out of Paul Rush brand's fold in any shamefaced way, or to keep"], [164, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 154 his dispute with him hushed up. Such men as he publish their quarrels on the housetops ; they go about button-holing their friends to give them the only true version of the story ; above all, they throw a good deal of mud, making sure that some of it will stick. Heartily, plentifully, and widely to vilify the Vicar was now the grocer's watchword. Paul Rushbrand must be inveighed against as a meddlesome busybody who, to curry favour with the Carews (and doubtless in consideration also of a solid money-bribe), had stood in the way of Stil borough's becoming a manufacturing city. . As to himself, if any reproached him for having done this or that, ' Well,' he would say, folding his arms and bringing his nose within an inch of his reprover's, ' Well, what of it ? Lady Hartleigh lent me seven thousand pounds. Where's the wrong ? If she had lent me seventy thousand, who has got a right to meddle ? It simply proves that I'm an honest man who can be trusted, doesn't it ? ' Meanwhile, Mr. Pottinger's accomplice, Helen Hartleigh, was feeling as uncomfortable as he did. It was bad enough to learn that Sir Giles's financial operations had destroyed her chance of bringing the races to Hazelwood Park \u2014 bad enough to see that her own husband rejoiced at this circumstance instead of taking her side ; but worse than all was it to hear that"], [165, "LADY HARTLEIGH 'S VAGARIES. 155 the Carews, against whose welfare she had conspired, and who must now be aware of her conspiracies, had regained their old county footing, thanks to Sir Giles's liberality. Helen \u2014 who knew Sir Giles better than most people \u2014 had not thought him capable of such outlays in money ; and, on being apprised of them, wrote him a bantering letter of congratulation, winding up with the request that he would let his future bride come and stay with her for a few days, as she longed to become good friends with her. To this no answer was returned, and Helen began to fear that the Carews intended to punish her for her scheming freaks by defi nitely cutting her. To prove whether this were so or not she issued cards for a big dinner of twenty-four, and invited Sir Peter and one of his sons, Mrs. Warrener and Mrs. Hunt, with their husbands, Sir Giles and Amy. They all came out of respect for Lord Hartleigh, and met Lady Pompermore, and an array of Highams, Tallmans and De Chevrons, the pick of the neighbouring gentry, who made up quite a grand and gloomy dinner. Helen had the satisfaction of shining in some of the family jewels lately reset ; but that was about all the satisfaction she did have, for the Carews treated her with that excessive politeness which is a more effectual barrier against intimacy than downright rudeness. ' Ceremonial,' wrote Dick"], [166, "777.4 7- ARTFUL VICAR. 156 Steele, ' is a bar invented by wise men to keep fools at a distance.' It is also a capital inven tion for enabling people to meet on civil terms who would not dare meet at all for fear of flying at one another if they were bound to be what posture masters are for ever telling us we ought to be \u2014 perfectly natural. Sir Peter had determined that he would have no revival of the quarrel with Lord Hartleigh, which had been the origin of all his recent troubles ; but he could not in his soul forgive Helen for what she had done and tried to do ; so he recommended her to his children as a person with whom one should keep on neighbourly terms (chiefly be cause of Lord Hartleigh's influence at election time), but whom it was not expedient to elevate to the status of ' friend.' Gloomy dinners beget gloomy days ; for if intimacies be not cemented, and if plans for mutual entertainment be not formed at those rare country dinners which bring people living miles apart together, when, how, and where shall such intimacies and plans come to a head ? During all the time that Sir Giles was bar gaining with Mr. Rodgie, and absent with him in London, Helen lived an intolerably dull life in her large house. The novelty of her rank had worn off ; and as hers was a nature requiring constant excitement to keep it in good spirits, the gratification of being ' my"], [167, "LADY HARTLEIGH' S VAGARIES. 157 ladyied' by servants and koo-tooed to by peasant-tenants soon palled. Strange to say, she missed Sir Giles and the smart tongue encounters they had almost every time they met. If Helen had loved her husband she would have been one of those wives whose influence over their partners is unbounded. Even her worst defects would have turned to his ad vantage ; for it is no small thing to a man to be wedded to a woman of untiring energy and ambition, whose quick wits, love of plotting, and brave unscrupulousness will all be employed to serve him. Next to purely good, religious wives, of whom there is hardly one in \u2014 well, no matter how many, women of this description make the best consorts, for they bring out all that there is in a man, galvanize him, push him on to exert himself in the paths best suited to him, and, whether he succeed or fail, support him with all the might of their strong, loving hands. But Helen's affection for her husband did not go beyond the cool feeling that he was a perfect gentleman, good-natured when not pro voked to peevishness, true to his word at all times, but otherwise insignificant \u2014 in the which lay her mistake, for he had the germs of many fine talents in him which might have blossomed had they been tended by other hands. It is"], [168, "158 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. not a good thing when husband and wife begin to feel bored in each other's company but a few months after marriage, when every day's dinner becomes a tedious, solemn ordeal of dry remarks exchanged in the presence of servants, and when the after-dinner period, even dis maller, is eked out by fitful dozings and scarcely suppressed yawns. It is not a good thing when husband and wife feel but the most languid interest, each in what the other has been doing to-day and will do to-morrow ; nor when the husband, in making projects as to this or that, is continually forgetting that he is married, and pulls up at the recollection with a sort of wince. Such had been the state of things between Helen and Lord Hartleigh since the day when she had confessed to having deceived him as to being with child, and further taunted him about the pranks of his ancestresses, and such it bade fair to continue. No wonder that Lord Hartleigh began to find more and more pleasure in loitering about his stables, and conversing with his trainer. He came to think that he should like to win a Derby, and hearkened complacently to sugges- tions for increasing his stud. His trainer was a hale, jolly man, who had a nose-reddening fondness for brandy neat. On several occa- sions the young * peer took a ' nip ' with him, just to keep out the cold, whilst examining the"], [169, "LADY HARTLEIGH'S VAGARIES. 159 legs of yearlings in the paddocks ; and he got to believe this sort of potation 'good for his health.' Very strong cigars, horsey-coats, groomish expletives, a daily increasing respect for the opinions and wise sayings of the stud groom, and a resolve to set up a four-in-hand in London next season, were the fancies which the trainer successively, but very quickly, cultivated in his master. Add to this that Lord Hart leigh hunted twice a week, and soon com menced declaring that he could not get any horses to suit him. All agog was he for giant brutes seventeen hands high, who could have carried men of three times his weight, and who went at their fences like gales of wind. The gentlemen of the South Stilshire Hunt observed that Lord Hartleigh always rode now as if he were steeple-chasing ; others took note of the fact that the least check in the field made him swear \u2014 a practice of which he had been entirely guiltless formerly. All this while Helen, being left much to her self, and having no pet friend of her own sex to associate with, lay in bed late of mornings, took a long time in dressing, a longer in lunching solitarily off dishes more dainty than strength ening, and surrendered herself to a very violent course of French novel-reading. Her author was Balzac, and she read him in the inexpunged original at the rate of about three"], [170, "160 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. volumes a week. Now if there be any writer whose works are calculated to fire a restless, unloving and unloved woman with the notion that she is a femme incomprise \u2014 or to console a viciously-disposed woman by the assurance that there are multitudes of others much worse than herself, it is this Balzac. He is the arch-apostle of womanly profligacy ; the most subtle deli neator of womanly cunning ; but especially is he the admiring extoller of woman's superiority over man \u2014 of her queenship in all things. In Balzac's world the whole mechanism of society \u2014 its smallest spindles as well as its biggest cogwheels \u2014 is worked by women, and men are but puppets in their hands. He sets no bounds to the domination which women, even when old and ugly, can acquire by mere dint of willing ; much more then does he tend to inculcate the moral that a woman having youth and beauty \u2014 as well as brains and the determination to make any means subservient to her ends \u2014 is abso lutely invincible, and need only look about her every day, like Alexander, for fresh worlds to conquer. It happened that at the moment when Helen was living most completely under the spell of this great French corrupter, she went to pay an afternoon visit to a neighbour, Lady Higham, and met there a Roman Catholic priest of the name of Culfield. Lady Higham,"], [171, "LADY HARTLEIGH'S VAGARIES. 161 a venerable relative of the Duke of Grandton, had recently joined the Romish Church, and thereby drawn down on herself a greater amount of public attention than had ever fallen to her lot while she worshipped peacefully in the faith of her fathers. The Rev. Father Culfield was her confessor \u2014 a bright, talkative, gentlemanlike man of forty, who had already drawn several perverts of distinction out of Anglican waters, and was reckoned among the most expert fishers of men. Helen fell into his nets at once \u2014 or rather she fluttered like a bird into the hands of a fowler, who has not yet spread his net to catch her. She invited Father Culfield to call at Hazelwood, and he was a regular visitor from that day, sharing with Balzac the task of completing her education. Religiousness entered but for a very small part into the attraction which Father Culfield and his faith exercised over Helen. Except in so far as every woman is a secret believer in a vague something, she had no beliefs at all. To put trust in Heaven was more than she dared ; to have believed in the opposite place would not have been convenient to a person of her antecedents. For all this, she had the usual womanly liking for the externals of religion \u2014 elaborate church services, ostentatious giving of alms, gracious patronizing of charity schools and societies ; and in all these things it was VOL. II. M"], [172, "162 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. well-nigh impossible for her to indulge so long as Paul Rushbrand was vicar of Stilborough. Here, for example, was Christmas approaching, and she durst do no more than forward dona tions to the different bounties, certain that if she ventured into the town to bestir herself in the good works of the season, she would meet the Vicar, and have to undergo a lecture from him on such points of her recent behaviour as might have reached his ears. And she might have to face much worse than an ordi nary lecture when it should be proved to Paul that she had deceived him in appealing for his compassion and good offices about her marriage on the ground that she was pregnant. In short, Helen dreaded Mr. Rushbrand ; and religion, as personified in him, was a repellant thing. But Father Culfield never sermonized ; his gentle exhortations were directed towards making his penitents well pleased with them selves, which was not a difficult task in Helen's case. Herein has the Roman Catholic religion such a great hold upon wealthy women sinners \u2014 that it lays so much store by good works that cost little self-sacrifice. It may have been noticed how, when once a Protestant English woman falls away, there seems to be no halting place for her between purity and absolute de gradation, accompanied by cynical recklessness ; whereas the ladies of Catholic countries by no"], [173, "LADY HARTLEIGH'S VAGARIES. 163 means throw away their self-respect or hopes of Heaven when their conduct has ceased to be edifying. The reason of this is, that while Protestantism holds out no hope of salvation, save by total inner regeneration, Catholicism has many soothing things to say to those who, without altering their secret modes of life, open wide their purses, fast, go pilgrimages, and employ themselves in works tending to the edification of others. The one is a religion of the heart, and it is to be feared that superficial people too often look upon the other as a re ligion of display ; so that Helen Hartleigh soon saw prospects of being able to employ her life profitably and agreeably to herself in pom pously pious works under Father Culfield's directions. The well-bred Father talked a great deal of new Catholic churches that might be built, and of the refined as well as select character of the Romanist circle in London society. ' Quite a club,' said he, ' of persons bearing the greatest historical names, and all bound together in a brotherly union, recalling that of the early Christian churches in the days of persecution.' Mr. Culfield, though, was quite shrewd enough to feel that the new Lady Hartleigh was a convert who would do him but little honour unless she brought her husband over with her. Lord Hartleigh, with his 50,000/. M 2"], [174, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 164 a year, parliamentary influence, personal popu larity, and grand connections, was the man to win ; and it was insinuated to Helen (in the most covert and delicate fashion) that she her self would be rather the worse than the better, socially speaking, if she changed her religion alone. This she understood, and was very glad at the nice manner in which Lord Hart leigh behaved towards Mr. Culfield ; but the Father himself was differently impressed by his niceness, for it appeared to him to signify that his lordship cared not a doit what company his wife kept. The most promising subjects for future conversion are the men, who, on seeing a Romish priest's visits become frequent, frown and remonstrate with their wives in private. If the wives hold fast, there is domestic strife, till at length the husbands, being roundly brought to book as to their reasons for abusing Popery, flounder so helplessly in their theolo gical ignorance, as to be happy to take refuge in the bosom of Rome to escape being con victed out of their own mouths of imbecility and impiety. Rash foes make capital proselytes, but to convert the indifferent is grievously uphill work. Father Culfield had not been slow to worm out of Helen the story of her marriage, nor to perceive that Lord Hartleigh had thrown off his wife's ascendency, and was running in a bad"], [175, "LADY HARTLEIGH'S VAGARIES. 165 direction for lack of able management on her part. It must consequently be his task to restore union between the two by advising Helen as to how her ascendency might be recovered ; but this could only be a labour of time ; and it had hardly commenced when Christmas arrived, closing what had been a very eventful year to all the personages' of this story."], [176, "166 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. CHAPTER XXXIII. CHRISTMAS EVE AT THE PARSONAGE. No snowing, but a violent north wind which caught up a light layer of snow that had fallen in the morning, and whirled it about the streets in fantastic wreaths. If one of these wreaths struck a passing man or boy, they coiled them selves about him like a muslin scarf, and left him covered with a fine, dry, cold dust. The women, less bold, turned their backs to these fierce tornadoes, and with their hands on their bonnets, their shoulders shrunk, and their dresses ballooning in front of them, allowed the boiste rous aggressors to pass and rush on, capering and curvetting, till they flattened themselves against the nearest wall \u2014 for all the world like white goblins foolishly dancing backwards and abruptly stunned by obstacles they knew not of. But neither men nor women were numerous abroad on this Christmas Eve, and the streets had long been deserted when the passengers began to arrive from the London train due at half-past six o'clock."], [177, "CHRISTMAS EVE AT THE PARSONAGE. 167 A dogcart drew up at the parsonage door. Flashing silver lamps, high stepping horse, cockaded groom behind, and a small aged man in black sitting beside the skilful driver. The door of the house opened, disclosing the brightly lit vestibule ; and Paul came out to greet the guest, whose coming had been announced to him by letter that morning. He might almost be said to have lifted the aged man off the dog cart step in his strong arms, so quick was the latter's descent ; and then it was : ' My dear young friend, how do you do ? ' ' My dear Mr. Truman, how glad I am to see you here ! ' But the Vicar had scarcely noticed the driver, who stepped lightly down and introduced himself. It was Oswald Carew. ' Dear me ! ' exclaimed Paul, surprised and pleased, ' by what fortunate hazard ? ' ' Oh, it's very simple,' laughed Oswald, shaking hands ; ' Mr. Truman and I made ac quaintance on board a channel boat not long ago, and to-day we met again at the railway station in London, both bound for the same part of the world, so we journeyed down together.' ' Captain Carew was good enough to forego the privileges of his first-class ticket to travel in third-class with me,' said the missionary ; ' and I have to thank him for giving me a drive which for swiftness I have never seen surpassed.' ' And now, if you will allow me,' added"], [178, "168 777,47\" ARTFUL VICAR. Oswald, cheerily, ' I'll just lay in a little stock of warmth by your fireside while Mr. Truman's traps are being lifted out ; then I'll go on to Royster.' ' Come in, come in,' said Paul ; ' and I hope I may persuade you to stay to dinner.' Indeed, if Oswald had lingered no longer than was needful to lift out the missionary's traps, he must have turned on his heel there and then, the afore-named traps being composed of one very small and shrunken bag, of which Mr. Truman took charge himself, as if his long sojourn among the Celestials had taught him the prudence of not trusting his goods to other hands. He was a slight, stooping man, with a careworn face, long silvery hair, and almost diaphanous hands. As he and Oswald Carew stood side by side in the glowing circle of warmth and light diffused by the Vicar's draw ing-room fire, they presented that always pathetic contrast of the two extremities of human life \u2014 the one stalwart, brave, and strong, having taken but one sip of the world's trials, and seeing a long future with all its possibilities before him ; the other white already with the pallor of those who stand within the shadow of death, and with his heart so sodden by experiences and griefs that a whole ocean of new troubles might have swept over it without adding a single drop to its overflowing sorrowfulness. Yet his manner"], [179, "CHRIST.MAS EVE AT THE PARSONAGE. 169 was serene rather than sorrowful, and he and Oswald appeared to have conceived a great liking for each other. This was evidenced by Oswald's reluctance to part company with him, by his subdued deference to all that the old man said, and by his visible endeavour to utter no thing that might recall the difference in their stations and usual modes of living. Paul, who had heard far more of Oswald than he had seen of him, thought him much altered from the light hearted, extravagant, and rather supercilious officer whom he had met at dinner at Hazel wood ; and he was gratified that Oswald accepted his invitation to dine without much pressing, but rather as if he were very glad of it. So Paul sent out to tell the Captain's groom to take the dogcart to the Red Lion, have his own supper there, and come back at ten o'clock ; and the two guests having vanished for a space to wash their hands, presently returned to the ruddy, cosy dining-room, under whose hospitable mahogany more than one bishop had tucked his gaitered legs in old days. Here the Vicar's stepmother was introduced, but she would never dine at table when there was company \u2014 indeed, she had hurried from the kitchen to put on the splendid black moire gown, the gold watch and chain, the brooch, and other fine things which Paul had lately bought for her ; and having been bowed to, and having smilingly played her part"], [180, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 170 of hostess for five minutes, it was certain that she would hasten back to the kitchen to see that nothing was spoiled by that barbarian English scullery maid whom she only left in charge of the spit and saucepans with fear and trembling. It was an ineradicable belief of the little French woman that no British servant can be trusted with a dish without immediately itching to toss the whole contents of a pepper-pot into it. The soups of the English were horrors to her palate ; their stews foretastes of the messes that will scorch the tongues of the doomed in the place of eternal torment ; and as to waste \u2014 oh ! the only occasions on which the even-humoured lady nearly lost her temper was when expatiat ing on the ignorant extravagance of English kitchen servants, for, as she said, she could have kept a whole family out of what these persons wasted. If Mrs. Rushbrand showed herself at all to her son's guests, it was merely to prevent the malicious tongues that so abound in country towns from saying that the Vicar was ashamed of his stepmother, and forced her to do servant's work; though anyone who had once seen Paul's tender, dutiful, and almost reverential behaviour towards the little old lady would have had no hesitation in laughing for ever afterwards at such an insinuation as a joke. Paul loved his stepmother with all his heart, and she him ; but her sphere was the kitchen \u2014 it was in minister-"], [181, "CHRISTMAS EVE AT THE PARSONAGE. 171 ing to his creature comforts that she felt best able to serve him ; and, of a truth, nor at this nor at that grand house where he had dined, had Oswald Carew ever tasted such a bright, well ordered, well-cooked little dinner as Mrs. Rush brand sent up, nor such wonderfully good black coffee as was served after it. There was no fourth diner at the table, for Digby Popham had gone to spend Christmas with his aunt, and the two young Fulmouths, who came in with Mrs. Rushbrand, likewise went out with her, having been promised a private treat, which was much more acceptable to them than dining with strangers. They were extraordinary boys these two who stood shyly close together like Siamese twins, whilst Oswald asked them their names, and whether they liked plum-pudding ? Nature had intended them to be fat boys, and had built them accordingly ; but their prolific mother having endowed them with so many brothers and sisters, the paternal larder had been put to sad shifts to feed them, and had only done so in a half-and-half make-believe sort of way. Until coming to live with Paul the boys had hardly ever eaten an unstinted meal ; and the outlines of their features, which should have been sleekly round, hung in pinched, empty folds, like the wrinkles of ill-blown blad ders. It had been a touching sight to see them dispose of their first unlimited dinner of roast"], [182, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 172 meat and pudding, and since that never-to-be forgotten inaugural performance they had steadily tackled their food three times a day like boys who have desperate arrears to make up. But in proportion as their cheeks became distended and their waistcoats grew more like the tightened skins of drums, so did their once torpid spirits awake like marmots out of winter sleep, thus inducing the hope that when they once came to be completely fat they might give tokens of a jocularity which had hitherto been lamentably deficient in them, and which made them but sorry companions for the scapegrace Master Popham. Mr. Truman ate little at this dinner, but his abstemiousness threw no damper over the knife and fork achievements of Oswald and his host ; and while these two were doing justice to the fare the old man told many a laughable story of the banquets which he had been made to swallow in China for the sake of proving to the natives that he had not come out there to make sport of their institutions. A certain dog soup served cold and flavoured with assaf\u0153tida seemed to have left an imperishable recollection on his palate. It has often been observed that the pleasures which we enjoy most are those which have come to us without any preparation ; and Oswald Carew was long destined to remember this un-"], [183, "CHRISTMAS EVE AT THE PARSONAGE. 173 foreseen evening at the vicarage as one of the most agreeable he had spent in his life. What chiefly struck him was the goodness of his com panions and their capacity for being amused and amusing without any recourse to disparaging anecdotes about their fellow-men. Considering how largely the small talk of ' Society ' depends on sneers, cynicism, scandal and malice, it was like being in a new world to hear two men con verse as though they had found far more of virtue than of vice in the world, and did not regard life as a mere drudging round of worries and disappointments. Oswald drew out the Vicar to give an account of his early struggles and adventures \u2014 and very modestly was it done, without any of the complacent conceit of the ' self-made man,' which is often more offensive than caste arrogance or purse pride. When, however, Paul alluded to the occasion of his first meeting with Mr. Truman and his conver sion by the latter, there was a deep tone of feeling in all he uttered, and his few remarks on the sense of awakening strength and hope that had possessed him when he began to believe in a world beyond this stirred sentiments which had long lain dormant in the bosom of Oswald Carew. His memory reverted to the day when he had stood beside the death-bed of his gentle, gifted mother, and had heard her say, as she looked into his eyes, that she was not going"], [184, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 174 away to any land where her children could not follow her, but that where she was going she would wait for them all. The hours glided by too soon, and Oswald would have been glad to believe that the Vicar's clock was fast when it struck ten, but the boom ing of the church belfry confirmed its accuracy, and he rose to go. With wishes for a merry Christmas, given and returned, and with parting shakes of the hand, the two clergymen accom panied him to the door. He invited them to come to Royster on the day after Christmas, and promised to see Mr. Truman several ftmes again during the week's stay which the latter proposed to make in Stilborough, saying which he had already swung himself into the high seat of that bright, flashing dogcart of his. Paul thought he looked wonderfully like his sister as he turned to nod them his friendly ' good-night' ; and next minute he was gone, the steps of his swift-trotting horse resounding in rhythmical cadence through the wind-whistling of the frosty night."], [185, "'75 CHAPTER XXXIV. BROTHER AND SISTER. Oswald had been expected to arrive home by dinner-time, and he knew that his delay must have excited conjecture, though he did not flatter himself that it would cause uneasiness. Since the Karetkine affair he had taken morbid views of the sentiments which his family har boured towards him. His brothers had once or twice spoken snappishly about the mess into which he had got them all ; and his father had written to him in cold terms, implying that he thought himself disgraced, which Oswald con sidered unjust, for the head and front of his offending, so far as he could see it, lay in his having been exceptionally unlucky. Under these circumstances his Christmas visit home had been undertaken rather as a matter of duty than of pleasure. But he need not have had misgivings as to the quality of the reception which he would get, for he was beloved more than he imagined ; and when old Sir Peter saw the serious, sad dened look which had grown on his eldest son's"], [186, "176 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. face his heart yearned towards him. By the silent grasp of the hand and the quiet pat on the shoulder Oswald guessed that the past was for given and forgotten ; nor were his sisters back ward in testifying that they deemed him the best of brothers \u2014 an object to be kissed, and taken by the arms and led to a broad armchair near the fire, and catechised as to what he had been doing to come so much behind his time. They were all in high good humour just then, for the Duke of Grandton's influence, exercised at the request of Sir Giles Taplow (in consider ation of the latter's having kindly parted with his phaeton horses at the cost price), had actu ally obtained for Captains Warrener and Hunt some appointments where the work was light and the pay generous \u2014 ' just the thing for them,' as their delighted wives exclaimed, and just the thing for anybody who can get it, the present writer would humbly add. If Amy forbore to chime in with the enthusiastic encomiums lavished on her intended husband's kindness, this was only natural to her position ; yet it did strike Oswald that she was a little cold and thoughtful for a bride expectant. Much surprise was expressed when Oswald stated how he had spent his evening. ' Dined with two clergymen ! well, you are becoming quite an exemplary character !' laughed Mrs. Warrener."], [187, "BROTHER AND SISTER. 177 ' You will be taking orders yourself next,' tittered Mrs. Hunt. ' Rushbrand is a noble fellow,' remarked Oswald, never heeding their quizzings ; ' and as for the missionary, he is a kind of saint' ' Did you say his name was Truman, dear ?' inquired Amy, looking pleased, and resting a hand on the back of her brother's chair. ' Why, Truman \u2014 surely that is the name of Lady Hartleigh's father ? ' remarked Mrs. War rener. ' And we heard that he was a missionary in China,' added Mrs. Hunt. ' So we did,' answered Oswald reflectively ; ' but no \u2014 it must be a coincidence in names, for Mr. Truman did not once mention Lady Hart leigh, and he is going to be Rushbrand's guest during his stay here.' There was not much talking after this, for it was past eleven, and before the family went to bed a time-honoured ceremony had to be per formed which had never been departed from on Christmas Eve since the brothers and sisters Avere children. A footman threw open the door, and the butler gravely entering, announced the cook, who staggered in with the full glory of his white jacket apron, and cap, and bearing on a silver tray a vast bowl containing ' to-morrow's pudding,' which was to be stirred for good luck. Happy cook ! he staked his little, very pardon- VOL. 11.

Time was\u2014 generations before \u2014 when this stirring was but the prelude to a whole night's brave junketing, with eating of cakes, black puddings and brawn, and the drinking of so much hot spiced ale that many of Sir Peter's ancestors awoke next day in a doubtful condition of fitness for the church services. Tempus edax rerum has swallowed up these fine old customs along with those who gloried in them ; but though we are a soberer people we may not have degenerated so much after all, for the painted Carews on the drawing room walls assuredly never, whilst in the flesh, looked down on a comelier group than that which clustered round old Sir Peter and wished him many happy returns of Christmas, when the pudding had been carried out. Oswald did not go to bed when the others retired, but remained in the drawing-room with his back to the fire, thinking that this would"], [189, "BROTHER AND SISTER. 179 probably be his last Christmas at home, and wondering where he should be next year and the year after that. He wondered, too, at the mistakes of his life so far as it had run, and at the scant joys which he had ever derived from those mistakes as compared with the joys which must have filled the lives of such men as Paul Rushbrand, who had toiled their way up from the lowest positions, doing good as they rose, and having the consciousness that they were of use on earth.. Confused visions of Chinamen and Hindoos began to flit before him, with tracts of far distant land that might be cleared and fertilized ; and maybe he had already sketched himself, bearded and sunburnt, with an axe at his girdle and a pipe in his mouth complacently surveying his first year's growth of vegetable produce, when the door softly opened and Amy glided in. ' Oswald, dear, may I keep you company ? ' ' That you may, darling. Come in, and sit down.' ' I don't feel sleepy to-night,' she said, and, when he had placed himself in the arm-chair, she settled herself on a stool at his feet, and rested her head on his lap. He affectionately stroked her hair, and taking her head between his hands, kissed her on the forehead. ' Well, Amy, this will at all events be your last Christmas as a resident N 2"], [190, "180 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. here. By this time next year you will have a home of your own. I was just wondering in what foreign roost I should be perching next yule-tide ? ' ' Why foreign roost ? ' she asked, glancing up. ' Because there is nothing for me to do in England, and I must be up and doing some thing to earn the bread I eat' ' You will stay at home, and manage papa's estates,' said she. ' You forget that thev will not be mine after our father dies. Every stick and stone of them will be mortgaged to your husband. I am going to sign the papers for cutting off the entail next week.' ' Oh, no, Oswald, you shall never do that,' she exclaimed, vehemently, ' never ! ' 'Hoity-toity! Who is to prevent me?' he said, chucking her pretty chin. ' There is no need why you should do it, dear ; for the estates are all ours, and will remain so, and we shall soon have paid Sir Giles every farthing we owe him, I hope. Listen, Oswald. I must tell you this secret, for I want somebody's advice ; and it has posi tively been burning me ever since I learned it' And in eager tones she told her brother all the particulars of the disclosure made her by Paul Rushbrand, and what facts in confirmation of"], [191, "BROTHER AND SISTER. 181 it she had gathered from her own observa tions. ' That's news, indeed,' remarked Oswald, when he had heard her in astonishment to the end. ' But \u2014 but I can't understand Taplow's game in this affair. He can't surely be wanting to cheat us ? ' ' Of course he does, dear, and nothing else. Why, he cares for nothing but money, and it is evident that from the first he knew of this mine ; and while we were marvelling and bless ing him for his generosity, he was only thinking how he might get paid several times over for the money which he lent us ! Oh, he is the craftiest and meanest of men \u2014 but I am so\u2014 so glad ! ' ' Glad ? ' queried Oswald, more and more puzzled, for his eye fell upon sundry wedding presents that glittered on a side table. ' Glad, dear, so that I have cried for joy, for now I shall not be obliged to marry him,' declared Amy, stoutly. ' And oh, Oswald, I never let any of you see it ; for whilst I thought my marriage with this man could serve you all, I cared for nothing else. But the thought of becoming his wife did make me so wretched.' Tears began to roll from her eyes as she said this, and her accents faltered : ' You see I have tried with all my might to like him, but I could not ; and of late, since I have known of his"], [192, "182 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. duplicity, my heart has been filled with a loath ing that passes all words. He was here this evening before you came, and talking about adding a wing to the grand stand, though he knows the course can never be used again for racing, so that I could hardly refrain from cry ing out, and branding him before everybody as a wicked storyteller.' ' 'Gad, this is a rum start,' ejaculated Os wald, whose mind was only dawning to a twi light conception of the sudden change in his affairs. ' I suppose the marriage will have to be broken off, presents and letters returned, and all that. It will make an awful row.' ' Never mind the row. We will pay the man his money, and tell him to be gone,' said Amy, coolly. ' And I'm to be heir to sixty or seventy thousand a year ! Well, that will be a queer transformation too,' laughed Oswald, hopping like an excited bird from subject to subject. ' Fancy our turning out to be mine-owners. Why, they'll make a peer of the governor ; I shall sit in the Commons, and, by Jove, we shall be marrying you, Bella, and Georgie to three coronets. There was Felwood saying the other day you were the prettiest girl he had ever seen, Amy. He's a bit of a spoon ; but he'll be Duke of Lowland, and you'd find him run quietly in harness.'"], [193, "BROTHER AND SISTER. 183 ' Lord Felwood may go about his business,' said Amy, with a smile and a toss of her head. Oswald laughed again, and stood up, giving Amy a hand to raise her from her stool. It was very late; the fire had long smouldered out, and one of the tall moderator lamps on the mantel-shelf gave notice that it was really time to go, by extinguishing itself. Oswald drew out his watch, and wound it up. ' Sleep and I shan't see much of each other to-night,' he remarked. ' But I say, Amy, how am I to act about this ? Shall I tax Taplow with the thing to his face, and hear what he says ? ' ' He is sure to tell you some untruth,' an swered Amy, with the intense scorn of women speaking of men whom they dislike. ' But act as you please, dear. The sooner he is gone the better for me, who am tired to death of the part I am playing.' ' Have you ever caught Taplow tripping in any statement, and committing himself about the coal ? ' asked Oswald. ' Not exactly that, but he is a clumsy actor,' replied Amy. ' For instance, he can't help leading me to \"Stubbs' Piece\" when we are out walking, and he furtively stamps on it all the time, as if he were trying the strength of a flooring. Then when he is indoors he plants himself near the coal-scuttle, and amuses him-"], [194, "184 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. self by taking up bits, and putting them on the fire to see how they burn. The other night a discussion sprang up about some new mag nesium light, and Philip said that before fifty years were past it was probable that every house would be lighted by electricity. At this Sir Giles flared up, and said there was no chance of any such thing. He was quite warm about it, as if he were already making his income out of candles.' ' Well, you had better candle yourself to bed, missy, and I'll think over the matter,' said Oswald. ' I suppose the sharpest thing to do will be to unmask Taplow on the day fixed for signing the papers. The racecourse ground won't be his till my signatures are given ; and when I state my reasons for refusing to sign, we'll produce Rushbrand as our witness ' i ' And there'll be \"an awful row,\" ' added Amy, mimicking his tone, and kissing him. ' Good-night again, dear. Oh, how happy I feel ! '"], [195, "iSS CHAPTER XXXV. TEMPERATURE AT BLOOD HEAT. Sir Giles had not been unobservant of a some thing altered in Amy's manner, and had only half deceived himself in trying to account for that something by various specious pretexts not detrimental to himself. Greatly to his chagrin, Amy had not yet consented to fix the wedding day, alleging that it would be time enough when all business questions were settled ; wherefore Sir Giles was most impatient to get the signing of documents concluded. To do him justice, he was already half sorry for the piece of dishonesty which he had undertaken ; and a vague sentiment haunted him that if any thing happened to mar his plot, it would serve him right. Why had he not been content with the splendid income which the mine under 'Stubbs' Piece' was going to yield him, without striving to grasp more ? And why had he not frankly gone to Sir Peter with the good news that he was hiding, as if it were a crime ? But when he came to this last question, Sir Giles"], [196, "186 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. knew very well for what reason he was conceal ing his news from Sir Peter, and this was the fear \u2014 instinctive rather than avowed \u2014 that if the Carews became rich they would pay him his money with thanks, and contrive to break his engagement with Amy, who, as he well knew, had accepted him only out of distress. And he loved Amy too well to run any risks. For no consideration whatever must the secret of the mine be revealed to her family till the marriage was accomplished. As to the large piece of the racecourse of which he was trying to get possession, Sir Giles privately called himself a blockhead for having put forth his hand to it, because reflec tion had now convinced him that he should not be able with any propriety to retain it once its value became known. However, he would have the satisfaction of playing the magnani mous by surrendering it, and thereby enhancing the character for princely and chivalrous open handedness which he flattered himself that he had already acquired in the estimation of the Carews, and the which was indispensable to the prestige which he aspired to assume over his wife. Oddly enough, although Sir Giles knew that the Vicar of Stilborough was acquainted with the secret of the mine, he never appre hended any breach of confidence on his part. Forgetting that he had put a limitation to the"], [197, "TEMPERATURE AT BLOOD HEAT. 187 period during which Paul was to keep his lips sealed, he fancied that he had given him general instructions to say nothing about it, and to this order he was persuaded that his confidant would remain obedient, so true is it that men of loose character, though they do not like those who are better than themselves, always do them justice by trusting them. Sir Giles did not spend Christmas day at Royster Hall, but set off early for London to dine with a Dowager aunt to whom he had been accustomed to render this homage once a year \u2014 not so much because she was a pleasant, garrulous old lady who always received him well as because she had a jointure of 1,500/. out of his estate and it was necessary that he should see her at the close of every twelvemonth for business reasons. She was a rich old dame this, who had stored by plenty of savings in the funds and owned a valuable collection of old china, to the prospective inheritance of which her nephew was not indifferent. Sir Giles took the Dowager Lady Taplow to church, had a drive in the park with her, ate beef, turkey and mince-pies in her tattleful com pany, and slept at her big house in Portman Square. Next day he planned to go shopping and return to Stilborough in the evening ; but all shops are closed on Boxing Day, so he was fain to take a box at Drury Lane and regale his"], [198, "188 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. aunt with a pantomime, the old lady frankly avowing her preference for this over all other forms of dramatic entertainment. On the 27th, several of the tradesmen could be seen, but their workmen were declared to be in that con dition not uncommon to the downtrodden prole tary about Christmas time, and unfit to do a stroke of work for another day or two. As Sir Giles was anxious to see some of the upholsterers' artisans in person in order to give them precise directions concerning the decorations which they were to commence at Taplow Court after New Year's Day, their post- festal indisposition kept him in town a couple of days longer. This brought him to Saturday, and his aunt then begged that he would stay over the Sunday for her sake : altogether, it was not till Monday, the 31st, that the baronet extricated himself from the entanglements of his town visit, and Avith a landau full of purchases, presents for Amy, &c, set his face homewards. On his way to the station he passed through the West-end street where Mr. Rodgie's cham bers were situate, and thought he would inquire whether this city gentleman had returned from his Christmas holiday. He had already left a card with the compliments of the season, and had learned that Mr. Rodgie was in the country ; this time the porter at the chambers told him that Mr. Rodgie had ' gone abroad.' There"], [199, "TEMPERATURE AT BLOOD HEAT. 189 was a mysteriousness and a brevity in the man's manner which arrested Sir Giles's attention, but he had no time to lose, and the circumstance might have dropped out of his mind had it not been very disagreeably revived by a paragraph in the Times which he read in the railway car riage. It was mentioned in the money article of the leading journal that the Murex Dye Works Company had failed, and that at a most stormy meeting of shareholders it had been decided to take legal proceedings against the manager in respect of some grave irregularities which had been discovered in his accounts. Something seemed to snap inside Sir Giles as he read this : it was a snap with an inward whirr like the escapement of an alarm clock. A portly gentleman of business-like aspect sat at the farther opposite corner, and was the only other occupant of the carriage. ' Can you tell me anything about this Murex Dye Company which has just failed ? ' inquired Sir Giles, addressing him as he would have appealed to any stranger as to the whereabouts of the best doctor if he had been taken suddenly ill. ' So many rotten companies nowadays that it's difficult to keep a recollection of them all,' answered the portly gentleman. ' I fancy I did hear, though, in the city on Saturday that the manager of a Dye Company had absconded, leaving eighteenpence in the cash-box.'"], [200, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 190 ' A man named Rodgie ? ' ' I don't remember his name. I heard somebody say that he was a practised scamp, that's all.' That's all ! and it was enough too for Sir Giles, who had paid five-and-twenty thousand pounds into this alleged delinquent's hands. What if he should have been victimised ? what if the whole story of the coal under ' Stubbs' Piece ' were an elaborate swindle into which he had let himself be trapped like the veriest gull ? The portly passenger sat unwinkingly gazing at him, doubtless curious to know why a gentleman should fidget about on his seat as if it were a hot plate. The journey seemed, in truth, to Sir Giles intolerably long, though the engine was tearing away at a pace which made the trees and telegraph posts fly past like the scat tered soldiers of an army in rout. When the train reached Stilborough the baronet made but one bound across the platform, and rushed out side the station to see if the waggonette which he had telegraphed for were in waiting for him. He stamped impatiently whilst his luggage was being got out of the van, and hardly waited for his groom's assurance that all the parcels were in to drive off at a pelting trot to the vicarage. He wished to see Paul, first, to ask him how and in what terms Mr. Rodgie had an nounced to him the existence of the mines ;"], [201, "TEMPERATURE AT BLOOD HEAT. 191 secondly, to request some advice of him in this new and disquieting conjuncture. But Paul was not at home. ' Where the devil is he, then ? ' yelled Sir Giles to the astonished maid. The damsel, reddening and looking frightened, opined that her master had gone to Royster ' along o' Mr. Truman.' ' What the deuce can the two be doing there ?' muttered Sir Giles to himself as the mention of the name of Lady Hartleigh's father started him on a new train of thought, and he lashed his horses onwards. The distance to Royster was just far enough to admit of the baronet's saying to himself that he ought to try and appear cool, but not far enough to allow of his attaining the degree of composure requisite. He was hotly excited, and it was a wretched, moist, leaden-skied day, not calculated to impart a single appeasing thought or one degree of physical coolness to the body. At the turn in the road which brought him in view of ' Stubbs' Piece,' Sir Giles pulled up and alighted. It was something in the nature of a comfort to find that the plat of ground was in its place \u2014 that no one had walked off with it ; the next bit of comfort to be got was by treading on it, poking the tip of his umbrella into the spongy sod, and interrogating every corner to see if perchance some fortuitous token might be sighted to prove the truth of what Mr. Rodgie had advanced."], [202, "777.4 7\" ARTFUL VICAR. 192 All this Sir Giles did, to the great bemud ding of his boots and trousers ; and so prodding his way along, he came to the rear of the grand stand, where Sir Peter's property began. He could hardly believe his eyes, and it quite took away his breath, when he stumbled upon three workmen digging. ' What the deuce are you doing there ? ' cried he, sharply, as soon as he could speak. ' Digging for a well, Sir Giles,' said the foreman, touching his cap. ' By whose orders ? ' and there was a gulp in the baronet's voice as he said this. ' Captain Carew's, sir ; he set us at the job this morning.' ' Set you to dig a well ? why, that's rank madness ! What can you want a well here for, with the Still flowing three hundred yards in front of you ? ' ' Dunno, I'm sure, sir,' said the workman, resting on his pick, and following with his eye the direction of Sir Giles's outstretched finger pointing to the sluggish little river. ' Truth is, we did wonder a bit, me and my mates, when we was a-set to do this heer job ; but of course we works as we're told. There is Captain Carew coming yonder, sir, with Parson Rush brand and another gem'man.' Sir Giles slouched off, fuming, to meet the comers, and so doing felt a presentiment of im-"], [203, "TEMPERATURE AT BLOOD HEAT. 193 pending evil that made his knees knock to gether. The fact is, Oswald's soldierly nature had been unable to brook the idea of practising dissimulation with Sir Giles ; and the shortest way to solve the coal mystery seemed to him to dig till coal was found, and he had given his orders to that effect after consulting his father in a long private interview which had left Sir Peter considerably agitated. If it had not been for a slight attack of gout which he thought prudent to nurse by his fireside, the old baronet would have stepped out with his son to watch the diggers at work. As it was, Oswald had written a note to Paul, and begged him to come and be a witness of the borings. The three gentlemen (for Mr. Truman had accompanied Paul) were in such deep conversa tion that they were not aware of Sir Giles's coming, and heard his voice before perceiving him. On his huskily hailing them, Oswald walked forward quickly to meet him, shook hands, and immediately explained the state of matters without any beating about the bush. ' You passed some workmen down there, I suppose, Taplow, and wondered what they were doing. Fact is, I hope they'll find coal.' ' Coal ? ' and it was as though a lump of that combustible had stuck in Sir Giles's throat red hot. ' Why, what can have put such an idea as that into your head ? ' vol. 11. o"], [204, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 194 ' It was Amy who told me,' said Oswald. ' And I who informed Miss Amy Carew,' added Paul, coming up. ' I confess, too, Sir Giles, that I was astonished you had not com municated a secret of such importance to those whom it most concerned.' ' And how do you know I had not my rea sons ? ' exclaimed Sir Giles in an aggressive, sneering tone. ' It's just like your meddlesome officiousness, Rushbrand, to come and make rash confidences without putting yourself to the least trouble to ascertain whether what you are saying be true or not. If you read this morning's Times you will see that I was pretty well jus tified in not raising hopes which might, and probably will, be disappointed.' ' What shall I find in the Times ? ' asked Paul, colouring at the brutality of Sir Giles's retort. 'Why, that your friend Rodgie has ab sconded after swindling a number of people, of whom I may possibly be one,' barked Sir Giles. ' But it's quite as likely as not that there may not be an ounce of Boghead mineral under the whole estate. There ! was I right to hold my tongue, or ought I to have gone cackling about and sending people into tantrums for nothing ?' This speech was a staggerer, and in the parlance of the ring scored first blood to Sir Giles ; but what mad infatuation was it that"], [205, "TEMPERATURE AT BLOOD HEAT. 195 drove him to leave the defensive, where he had found firm ground, and to fly out into a furious attack upon Paul, who had done him no in tentional harm ? ' Yes, and if it turns out that I have been swindled, I shall have you to thank ! ' cried he, as the light in his blear-eyes kindled into savage rancour. ' It was you who acted as go between betwixt that fellow and me, and you may consider yourself lucky if I don't indict you for conspiring with him to cheat me. I daresay if your breeches pockets were turned inside out, plenty of my guineas would be found sticking to them.' ' Now there's a foul aspersion,' said Paul, with the calmness of contempt, though he could not help clenching his fists behind him, till the seams of his black gloves cracked. ' And it is one that cannot benefit you, Tap low,' ejaculated Oswald, coming warmly to the Vicar's succour. ' Remember that you are on your own trial just now ; for though you were certainly at liberty to defer telling us that we had mines under our feet until you were quite sure of the fact, yet you might just as well have postponed your attempts to get hold of the re mainder of the racecourse until the same period.' ' You don't think I am going to justify myself on a question of honour to you ?' ex claimed Sir Giles, laying most offensive stress o 2"], [206, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 196 on the pronoun. ' It's bad enough to be on the point of having for one's relation a man who has been turned out of the army, without being lectured by him on one's moral obligations. I'll justify myself to Amy, and to her only.' ' You won't find Amy at home,' said Oswald, barring his way, and quivering with an indignation which would have made any but an exasperated man wary of pushing him to lengths. ' Amy is on a visit at Hazelwood.' ' At Hazelwood ! without my leave ? ' 'Lord Hartleigh called last week and invited her to spend three days, so she went on Satur day, with my two elder sisters,' answered Oswald, drily. ' As to your permission, I think you will find my sister inclined to dispense with it in future, unless you can defend yourself in more becoming terms than you have used in speaking to us.' Sir Giles had turned on his heel. He now wheeled round, scarlet with passion, strode for ward, and pointed his umbrella in a menacing way at Mr. Truman, who had been a silent and mortified spectator of the foregoing scene.' ' Who is that man ? ' shouted he. ' Are you Mr. Truman, sir, the father of the woman who calls herself Lady Hartleigh ? ' ' My name is Truman,' replied the mission ary, timidly, whilst a tinge of colour rose to his wan cheek."], [207, "TEMPERATURE AT BLOOD HEAT. 197 ' Ah, then I've fallen into a pretty gang, by G ! ' laughed the baronet, coarsely. ' Do you know who that person is whom you have sent your sisters to stay with at Hazelwood, Carew ? Do you know that she is a bigamist ? Ah, yes, sir, you shan't intimidate me ! ' \u2014 this he said as Paul instinctively made a step for ward, as though to silence him. ' Remember in whose presence you are speaking, Sir Giles,' cried the Vicar, sternly. ' I'll remember that you are an adventurer, and that your companion is probably no better,' bawled the baronet, with insolent loudness, as if he wanted his words to reach far and wide. ' Who are you, sir, and what brought you here ? You come one day, the devil knows whence, get yourself elected vicar by connivance with a blackguardly grocer ; you abuse your clerical character to work on the feelings of a soft hearted boy, and bully him into marrying a regular loose woman, who is already wedded to a circus-rider, but who happens to be the daughter of your respectable friend yonder, who no doubt, like yourself, draws a fine yearly allowance out of Lord Hartleigh's pockets ; you are next heard of inducing the sham Lady Hartleigh to lend a big sum of money to your old pal the grocer, in order that he may get possession of this piece of land, and enable you to concert with a swindler in London as to how"], [208, "198 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. you may re-sell it at a long profit to me !

One bright morning your door will be found locked, and it will turn out that you were no parson at all, but some artful dodger, whose sea voyages were all undertaken on board convict ships ! ' ' Don't answer the fellow ; he's mad or drunk ! ' exclaimed Oswald, laying a restraining hand on the Vicar's arm. ' Drunk ! ' echoed Sir Giles, turning with a venomous glance on the speaker. ' At all events, when / drink, Oswald Carew, I only injure myself \u2014 I don't make others drunk for the purpose of fleecing them to death ! ' ' By heavens, this is too much, you accursed scoundrel!' cried Oswald. And, though Sir Giles skipped nimbly enough out of the way, the furious back-hander which the Captain levelled at him would assuredly have alighted on his puffy face had not Paul interposed his arm in the way of it. ' The man is not worth punishing,' said Paul, dissuadingly, much as he was himself excited. ' You had better go home, Sir Giles, before our tempers get the better of us,' added he."], [209, "TEMPERATURE AT BLOOD HEAT. 199 ' Oh, I've not done with any of you yet,' howled the baronet, retreating backwards. He shook his umbrella as a parting threat ; and presently his waggonette was seen flashing with him at a breakneck pace towards Stil borough."], [210, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 200 CHAPTER XXXVI. A NEW TURN IN THE GAME. ' I am sorry that he escaped the thrashing he deserved,' ejaculated Oswald, though he was perhaps glad at heart that he had not been allowed to commit himself. ' He appears to be a man of ungovernable temper,' remarked Mr. Truman, visibly affected by the abominable words that had been hurled at him. ' God help the beautiful and amiable young creature whom he is going to marry ! ' said Paul, with a sigh. And the three moved on, for it was be ginning to rain. Oswald was pondering over the words which the Vicar had just spoken. They made him shudder. It was obvious that if no coal were found on the estate, the position of the Carews towards Sir Giles would be worse than it had ever been before ; for they would stand hopelessly in debt to a man whom they had insulted. Apologies would have to be made,"], [211, "A NEW TURN IN THE GAME. 201 the quarrel would be patched up somehow, and perhaps Amy would marry a man whom she ab horred, simply to prevent its being said that her family had swindled him out of enormous sums of money under pretence of giving him one of their daughters in marriage. The result of these distracting reflections was, that Oswald was moved by a gust of unreasonable anger towards Paul for having communicated the mine secret to Amy without being certain of its truth. He forgot that in the nature of things it was impossible that Paul could have had any such certainty. He forgot, too, that twice or thrice already he had warmly thanked him for the service rendered. Unhappy Paul had his own troubles to bear, and so had Mr. Truman, who walked in such forlorn dejection by his side. Both of them were thinking of Sir Giles having called Helen Hartleigh a bigamist ; and so engrossed were they by this dire accu- sation, that they were convinced Oswald must be thinking about it exclusively too. It rose to the lips of both of them at the same time to attempt an explanation ; but Oswald, attaching little weight to what Sir Giles said, and too much absorbed besides by his own concerns, answered : ' Pooh, who cares for that man's jabberings ? ' ' If I could only know whether what he said"], [212, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 202 were true or not,' moaned the missionary, with a miserable look of anguish in his aged face. ' True \u2014 of course not. It's a lie he has forged or picked up somewhere,' replied Oswald, having not the faintest conception of what it was that he was denying so emphatically. ' How could he speak so positively, though, if he had not some information ? ' asked the wretched father. ' Information about what ? ' ' About my unfortunate daughter's first hus band being still alive,' returned Mr. Truman, piteously. ' Oh ! ' said Oswald. And being thus re called to the subject in hand, he brought to bear on it as much of his scattered attention as he could, and was made to listen to one of the saddest tales that ever left the lips of a grieving father. The details of it need not be given ; but the sum of it was that Helen Truman had deserted her home when not quite sixteen, and had eloped with a circus-rider whom she had subsequently married. She had written once to her father to inform him that a child had been born to her, and to implore him for assist ance, but that was all he had heard from her or about her until in China he had received Paul Rushbrand's letter announcing Helen's second marriage. Paul himself had heard nothing of Helen's first marriage till he was apprised of it"], [213, "A NEW TURN IN THE GAME. 203 with Mr. Truman's own lips ; for a letter, in which the missionary had mentioned the cir cumstance, and which had been posted in China, would appear to have miscarried. Oswald's interest in the narrative had been excited long before the speaker came to the end of it. He reflected that Sir Giles, in his present exasperated state of mind, would pro bably rush off to Hazelwood Hall, and create a scandal by making everything known to Lord Hartleigh, and frightening Amy, Helen's visitor, out of her senses. This he determined to prevent if he could ; but no time was to be lost, and as soon as they came within hail of the Royster Hall stables, he called to a groom, and told him to get the dog-cart out. ' Have you any authentic proof of your daughter's first marriage ? ' asked Oswald, as they took refuge from the rain in the stable yard whilst his order was being executed with all despatch. Mr. Truman shook his head. ' I have never received a copy of the certifi cate, if that is what you mean ; but there must have been such a marriage, else Sir Giles Tap low could not have alluded to it.' ' I believe Sir Giles professes to have been acquainted with Lady Hartleigh before her marriage ? ' ' Yes ; and now it strikes me that he never"], [214, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 204 made mention of a previous marriage to me,' said Paul. ' Moreover, it was he who intro duced Miss Truman to Lord Hartleigh in the first instance, and introduced her as an unmar ried lady.' ' That much he has told me, and more than once ; nor did he ever breathe a word about Lady Hartleigh having been already married,' concurred Oswald. ' I wonder where he can have obtained his information ? ' sighed Mr. Truman. 'At any rate, I'll prevent him from carrying it about like a firebrand,' muttered Oswald, be tween his teeth. ' Before I suffer him to break up Hartleigh's home and break your heart, I will exact from him unassailable proof of his assertions.' ' God bless you ! ' faltered the missionary. ' But \u2014 but ' \u2014 and laying a trembling hand on Oswald's sleeve, he looked wistfully into his face \u2014 ' my dear young friend, supposing what he says be true, have \u2014 have we any right to keep Lord Hartleigh in ignorance of these facts ? Consider my miserable predicament, as a father, between affection for my unhappy child, and duty towards the man whom she may have deceived.' ' Leave the whole matter to me, Mr. Tru man,' answered Oswald, biting his moustache. 4 John, fetch me out my waterproof, please ;"], [215, "A NEW TURN IN THE GAME. 205 and when I'm off get out the landau, to take these gentlemen back to Stilborough.' This he said to put an end to a conversation which might soon have run him on to the horns of a dilemma. The groom brought him his white mackintosh, and Oswald lifted the hood over his head, making a joke about the comical appearance he cut. The rain had now settled into a steady downpour. It plashed on to the slate roof of the coach-house, dripped from the eaves, ran bubbling through gurgoyles and water-pipes, and engulfed itself with a roar into the drains. The gutta-percha flooring of the stable-yard was washed clean as a dripping dinner-plate, the brown frisking yard-dog was soaked through like a sponge, and the grooms who harnessed the horse to the dog-cart steamed with damp. But they made none the less alacrity, knowing that when ' Master Os wald ' took out any creature \u2014 man or beast \u2014 in foul weather, it was on urgent service. Carefulness of the welfare of their horses, and consideration towards their servants, were qualities common to all the Carews, and in none more conspicuous than in Oswald. He shook hands with the clergymen in parting with them, and advised them to go indoors, talk a little with Sir Peter, and get warm before going back to the town. When he had ascended on to the high seat of his"], [216, "206 777.4 7\" ARTFUL VICAR. trap, he nodded to them, and with a look that bade them be of good cheer. There are men who in the hour of trial can be relied upon, as stout oak staves ; of such kind was Oswald Carew \u2014 far stronger, discreeter, and firmer when conducting anybody else's business than his own. But what of Sir Giles during this while ? He had driven off for Hazelwood, but branched off homewards on his way, partly because he was getting wet, partly because the being wet cooled him, and brought him to feel that he had made a fool of himself. In per sonal courage he was not emulous of the lion, nor even of the dog, and his occasional out breaks of violent temper were quickly followed by desponding reactions, during the which he lamented all that he had said and done, and quaked for the consequences. ' You lose your temper, therefore you are in the wrong,' said one ancient sage, debating with another. Like wise, Sir Giles Taplow began to see that if he had remained calm and dignified on this pre sent morning, it would have done his case more good than harm. When he reached Taplow Court, however, and trod its cheerless passages and deserted rooms, all his smouldering anger revived. Piled up in the hall were the chairs and tables taken out from chambers which it was intended to"], [217, "A NEW TURN IN THE GAME. 207 re-paint and re-furnish for the new mistress of the house ; and there on the sofa in his sitting room were strewn the presents which he had bought in London for Amy. It was too bad to think that perhaps she might never accept these gifts at his hands \u2014 -that all the money he had spent and squandered, .throwing it away with both hands as it were, would have been spent and squandered in vain \u2014 too bad to think that all his hopes of married happiness were going to be dashed because of a conspiracy made by a parcel of worthless people to ruin him. He muttered low, vigorous curses as he pictured to himself Helen Hartleigh sitting at that minute with Amy, and making fun of him ; but this phantasy was an absurd one, for ladies who invite a bride-elect to stay with them do not generally regale her with mockings anent her bridegroom ; and at the moment when he madly cursed her, Helen, all unaware that there was any hitch in his matrimonial prospects, was politely descanting on his many qualities. More variable than the gyrations of a weathercock are the moods of man. A couple of hours ago Sir Giles was grinding his teeth at the possibility that he had been deceived by Mr. Rodgie \u2014 now he felt that his only hopes in the future rested on his having been thus de ceived ; for after what had passed this morning,"], [218, "208 777,47\" ARTFUL VICAR. should coal be found on the Carew estate, he \u2014 Sir Giles\u2014 would be treated as an. ordinary creditor, be paid, and packed about his busi ness. To be sure, he would have the consola tion of drawing such income as he could from Stubbs' Piece ; but what was money to him without Amy ? Yes, interrogating himself as to the price he would pay to have that little white hand laid trustingly and lovingly in his own for ever, Sir Giles avowed that he would give up everything he had, and be a beggar, if she would but share his poverty with him. This disinterestedness of his own made him weep. Possibly the ready flow of his tears was materially assisted by the contents of a case bottle which he had drawn from a cupboard \u2014 rich, odorous French brandy, clear as melted cairngorm, and which he quaffed with no more moderation than if it had been sherry and water. The more he wept the more he drank, till he began to strut about, and rehearse what he should say to confound Helen, brave Lord Hartleigh, and soften Amy if she should prove obdurate. Hope rose again out of this pot valour ; yet the ceaseless pelting of the rain against the window-panes made him reluctant to set out for Hazelwood just yet. He thought he would dress in his smartest clothes to make himself look more imposing, and go out by-and-by in his phaeton with the"], [219, "A NEW TURN IN THE GAME. 209 two high stepping bays, which were to be sent to Grandton Park next week. So presently he marched into his bedroom, and found there a bright coal fire, with a couple of beech logs heaped on the top, and blazing merrily. He sat down in an arm-chair, and spread his hands towards the dancing flames, feeling comforted by their warmth. But soon this heat, operating with the quantity of spirits which he had drunk, brought on drowsiness, so that he sank back, saying that he would doze ten minutes, and fell into a heavy stertorous slumber, which lasted more than two hours. He awoke at the noise of somebody enter ing, rubbed his eyes, and saw his valet. ' Eh, what's up ? I've overslept myself ' Sir Giles, Thomas has just brought in the news of an accident happened to Lord Hart leigh,' said the servant, in commotion. 'His lordship was thrown from his horse, out hunt ing this morning, and has been picked up for dead.' - y VOL. II."], [220, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 210 CHAPTER XXXVII. IN THE FLOWER OF LIFE. It was just as his horse was debouching into Hazelwood Park avenue, and breasting the storm of wind and rain like a centaur, that Oswald sighted that picture very familiar to hunting men \u2014 a group slowly carrying a hurdle with an outstretched figure in a red coat lying upon it. It needs not a callous heart, only well seasoned nerves, to view these apparitions with composure, for when all has been said about the danger of fox-hunting, deaths in the hunting field are rare. A man on a hurdle means mostly a man badly shaken, or, at worst, frac tured as to one of his limbs ; however, Oswald uttered the usual cry of commiseration at the sight, and, quickening his pace, drove straight for the group, amongst whom he soon recog nised the Duke of Grandton and his old enemy, Colonel Pounceforth. The latter took no notice of him, but the Duke cried out : ' You're just the man, Carew ! Hartleigh has had a fall ; drive on fast to the"], [221, "77V THE FLOWER OF LIFE. 211 Hall, and tell my lady before it reaches her through any of the servants \u2014 and say it's no thing.' A nod that meant more than it said accom panied these words. His Grace could not proclaim aloud the extent of the sufferer's inju ries, and Oswald understood him. He started off again over the slushy gravel of the avenue, between the rows of wind-tossed trees, all black and leafless, and in five minutes reached the hall entrance. Helen, with Mrs. Warrener, Mrs. Hunt and Amy, was in the drawing-room, and all four ladies were gathered round the fire, listening to some stories told by Father Culfield, who had thoroughly ingratiated himself with his hostess's visitors. None of the Carews were strait sec tarians ; they were too deeply anchored in the faith, customs and prejudices of the Church of England to make any fuss about it, and could enjoy the talk of an accomplished and amiable Romanist without feeling that they ran any dan ger of being drawn into apostasy. Amy was especially cheerful. The relief of being freed from Sir Giles's daily courtship ; the prospect of being soon rid of him for ever, and of seeing her brothers all richer and happier, than they had ever been before, combined to render her visit to Hazelwood more pleasing than it might have been if Lady Hartleigh's hospitality had been P 2"], [222, "777.4 7\" ARTFUL VICAR. 212 the only attraction of it. And yet, now that they had lived three days under her roof, there was not one of the sisters but felt that Helen was very sprightly, good-natured and amusing. ' She is very liveable-with,' was the ungram matical but expressive term that Mrs. Warrener and Mrs. Hunt employed to convey that her ladyship had ruffled none of their pet fancies \u2014 not presumed in any way \u2014 not ' my-ladied ' it over them, but been unaffectedly frank and jolly, and done her best to make them so. And this rainy day had been the frankest and jolliest of all. As Helen did not care for hunting, and as the morning had opened with unenticing murkiness, Amy and her sisters had declined Lord Hartleigh's invitation to accom pany him to the meet at Wood Flat, to the which he was himself bound by an appointment. They had spent the forenoon snugly indoors, delighting themselves with fireside gossip on all things exclusively feminine, till the luncheon hour brought with it Father Culfield, who \u2014 as Mrs. Warrener said to Mrs. Hunt \u2014 was really too delightful, and who would have made some nice girl or other a charming husband if Catholic priests had been allowed to marry, though for her part she rather approved of the Popish rules about clerical celibacy, for the worst of English clergymen was unquestionably their wives. In a word, all passed off gaily among the ladies,"], [223, "IN THE FLOWER OF LIFE. 213 and not a cloud seemed to hover over Hazel wood, when the butler came to the door with a scared face, and asked if her ladyship could come out for a moment and speak ' to the house keeper.' Apologising to her guests, Helen unsuspect ingly went into the hall, and was confronted by Oswald, whose reeking garments, grave face, and kind pressure of the hand were a tale of woe in themselves. In half a dozen careful sentences he told his errand, and tried to avert alarm. Helen turned ghastly pale, and answered not a word, but her conduct was admirably impulsive. Though clad for indoors and lightly shod, she darted out of the house, without stopping to put anything on her head, without waiting for an umbrella to be held over her, and flew down the avenue with her golden hair streaming in the wind and her blanched face lashed by the rain. When she reached the group of gentlemen, who sympathisingly made way for her, bareheaded she bent over the hurdle, and, seeing her hus band livid and unconscious, wrung her hands in an agony of mute horror. ' By Jove, it was quite touching,' as the Duke afterwards said to his fascinated wife ; ' the poor creature seemed to be turned into a statue ! ' Slowly the grooms who were carrying the hurdle advanced to the Hall, and Lord Hart leigh was borne up to his room. Helen never"], [224, "777.4 7\" ARTFUL VICAR. 214 left him. She had begged Oswald to go and join his sisters and do the honours of the house for her to the gentlemen below, and see that the servants who had brought her husband home were properly attended to and rewarded ; and she herself, with perfect presence of mind, quick hands, and speechless energy, assisted the Duke of Grandton and the young peer's valet to un dress him and put him to bed. A doctor had been sent for from the spot where the accident occurred, and he arrived before Lord Hartleigh's unconscious head had lain ten minutes on the pillow ; but though he stared at the body and felt the patient's pulse his nervousness prevented him from being of much use. Dr. Twix was the name of this medical man, and in point of skill, both as a physician and surgeon, he was second only to the best practi tioners in London ; but all his gifts were annihi lated by fits of shyness and self-distrust which overcame him as soon as he sound himself called upon to prescribe for the great of this earth. Farmers, tradesmen, and labourers he attended calmly and cured to perfection, and so well aware was he of his own healing powers that, being in no wise modest when discoursing with his familiars, he would sighingly declare that if ' he had had his chance ' he might have rolled his brougham in Pall Mall with the princes of the therapeutic art. But he had had hundreds"], [225, "IN THE FLOWER OF LIFE. 215 of chances ; Fortune was never tired of throwing them in his way ; the admiring clamours of humble folks whom he had dragged from the jaws \u2014 nay, from the very stomach \u2014 of Death swelled so loud that over and over again people of note had called for his services sooner than for those of a London doctor ; but on every one of such occasions he had failed disastrously. Contact with a squire's lady made him shiver ; examining the tongue of a baronet shot terrors through his soul ; the responsibility of righting the ailments of a peer oppressed him like a hundredweight of lead brought down on his head with a thump and addling all his brains. Goodness knows how he would have disported himself in the presence of any member of the Royal Family ; but such a crisis would no doubt have driven him out of his mind outright. The squeamish, shifty look of the man, his bald arching head (with bump of veneration mon strously developed), his stammering efforts to appear at his ease, and his utter inability to walk, talk, or behave himself like a rational being, when in the presence of personages whose patronage might have enriched and exalted him \u2014 all stamped him as a creature in whom the craving for honours has developed a worship for them akin to idiotic ecstasy. ' Come, man, don't stand staring there and doing nothing,' bluntly exclaimed the Duke of"], [226, "216 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. Grandton, who was conversant with Dr. Twix's peculiarities from having once seen him nearly kill the Duchess at her confinement. ' Please tell me if there is any danger, Dr. Twix,' prayed Helen, more civilly and sooth ingly. ' May \u2014 I \u2014 I ask your ladyship how it hap pened ? ' stuttered the doctor, who had not yet collected himself sufficiently to lay his hat down. ' It was a fall at a five-barred gate,' said the Duke, briskly. ' The weather was so misty that Hartleigh ought never to have taken such a leap at all. The horse caught his foot in the top bar, rolled over, and I believe fell on his rider.' ' In \u2014 in \u2014 in such a predicament I should really like to have the \u2014 the \u2014 op \u2014 opinion of Sir William Prestler,' muttered the doctor, mention ing the name of the best surgeon in London with a sort of whine. ' Yes, yes, I daresay, and we'll have him up by telegram ; but meanwhile do your best, or your patient will sink for want of care, and such an accident would be laid at your door,' ejacu lated the Duke, with a stamp of his foot. Thus pointedly admonished, Dr. Twix dropped his hat on the floor and made a charge at the bed as if he were running to the cannon's mouth. He pulled down the clothes, felt the patient's limbs, laid his ear on his heart, passed"], [227, "IN THE FLOWER OF LIFE. 217 a cautious hand over his head, drew down his lower eyelids, and then tossed his arms aloft like one whom the Fates have conspired to perse cute and ruin. ' Hopeless case,' he soliloquised aloud. ' Thigh fractured, three ribs broken, chest crushed, concussion of the brain \u2014 the horse couldn't have damaged him more if he had done it all on purpose. My lord may recover consciousness for an hour or so, but he'll be dead before this time to-morrow.' ' Dead be d d ! ' broke out his Grace, impatiently, thrusting the driveller aside. ' Don't be alarmed, Ladv Hartleigh. I have seen , */ o twenty of these cases and no harm come of them. I was once in bed for three months, with every one of my limbs wrong. As for you, sir, you're a simpleton, and I'm ashamed of you.' A despairing project of going out to hang himself must have crossed Dr. Twix's mind at that moment. ' Of course, your Grace \u2014 of course, my lady, patients sometimes do recover from these acci dents,' he faltered. ' When I spoke just now I was only giving a professional opinion\u2014 that is to say, a \u2014 I mean I only spoke ' ' You spoke like an ignoramus, sir, and if you can't control yourself you had best be gone,' cried the Duke, highly irritated, for courteous"], [228, "218 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. toleration of fools was no part of his Grace's system in life. But Helen could not mistake the shade which had passed over Dr. Twix's face as he made his diagnosis ; and when presently the luckless surgeon (no doubt after some secret in vocation to the gods) laid himself out to do his best, and really did bestir himself as actively as was possible, there was nothing in his features from which a ray of hope could be drawn. Even the Duke of Grandton felt that to raise ground less expectations may be at times but a false kindness. When he saw Mr. Twix acting like one collected and competent, he became civil to him, and called him aside. The result of their whispered conference was .that the Duke ap proached Helen very kindly and considerately, saying : ' We must hope for the best, Lady Hart leigh ; but I think in such a conjuncture Hartleigh's mother ought to be telegraphed for, and perhaps his solicitor, in case \u2014 ahem \u2014 he should like to settle anything when he re covers consciousness.'"], [229, "219 CHAPTER XXXVIII. Helen's explanation. The Dowager Lady Hartleigh, Sir William Prestler, the Court surgeon, and Mr. Casewell, Lord Hartleigh's solicitor, were telegraphed for. The Duke of Grandton very feelingly volun teered to stay at the Hall until they arrived, and make himself useful : he was much struck by Helen's beauty, and felt a pity for her manifest affliction, which drove from his mind all remi niscences of the awkward stories which had been whispered about her antecedents. Besides, he was there en gars on, and the eye of the Duchess was not upon him. When the Duke had left her to go down stairs and refresh himself, Helen sat alone by the bedside \u2014 alone, that is to say, with Dr. Twix ; but this bashful gentleman having dis creetly retired to a corner, where he made him self as small as possible, did not count for much. There were no tears in her eyes, but livid circles had settled round them, making them preter naturally deep. Her features were ashen, her"], [230, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 220 hands dry, and the thoughts that revolved in her mind were like the spokes of a wheel, spin ning round and round with giddying, sickening velocity. She had no expectation of her husband's recovery : in a few hours she knew that he must die, and once again she would be alone in the world. What that prospect signified she could as yet but hazily determine ; but she felt that there was going to be a great gap in her life, and that a multitude of things which she had been exciting herself to hope and scheme for were about to come to nought. She glanced at the bed where Lord Hartleigh lay, with his boyish face so lifeless, his breath so faint, and his right hand plucking with an unchanging, mechanical motion at the counterpane ; and at that moment she felt that she loved him. It was not indeed that kind of love which men expect from women. There was more in it of sisterly protection than of wifely passion, for Helen was older than her husband, not in years only, but in experience, and his weaker nature had bowed too submis sively to hers. But she remembered how true and pure had been in him the instincts of a gentleman, how gentle and good he was in his undemonstrative way, how little he had rebelled against her or sought to give her pain even when her conduct had furnished him with the justest cause of offence. There were perhaps in her"], [231, "HELEN'S EXPLANATION. 221 glimmerings of nobler things than appeared in her actions \u2014 few women have not a soft corner in their hearts \u2014 and it was Helen's misfortune rather than her fault if Lord Hartleigh's charac ter had been unable to mould hers after its own image, giving it the fair impress of truth and honesty. There was no mixture of selfish thought in her mourning just then, for she had no reason to feel uneasy as to the future, in a pecuniary way. Lord Hartleigh had made a will soon after his marriage, and the provision settled upon her was a magnificent one. The reflections that pre sented themselves to her in that racking whirl of the mind's wheel were regrets for the unmaterial things she was going to lose and dread of the unfriended loneliness that would fall upon her existence. Also a superstitious sentiment shot stray flashes upon her, revealing an Unearthly Chastising Hand that perchance had been at work in her bereavement, depriving her of her triumphs at the time when she was most tempted to exult over all that her audacity had won, and proving to her that ' except the Lord build the house their labour is but vain that build it' But Helen Hartleigh could not weep. Tears would have been a relief, and the source of them seemed paralysed. She sat with stony face and sinking heart, awed by her own stillness and taking no account of the flight of time."], [232, "777.47\" ARTFUL VICAR. 222 By-and-by some words murmured by Dr. Twix roused her. That singular individual, left completely to himself, had so far recovered his wits as to feel impelled to see whether on a second examination he could not recant his first opinion as to the state of the sufferer. His de spondency only redoubled when he felt the fluttering pulse, but he saw his way to doing something which might restore consciousness the quicker, and he timidly asked Helen whether a tincture which he named could be procured. There was a medicine chest in the house, and it was generally locked in a cupboard of Lord Hartleigh's study : Helen instantly rose to go and search it. She met nobody on the staircase, but outside the study door she was startled to hear voices raised in violent altercation. Incredulous, she paused, thinking her overstrained senses must have deceived her ; but no \u2014 and now to the jar ring of the angry tongues was suddenly added the noise of a scuffle. The amazement occa sioned by such a breach of decorum at such a time was heightened when Helen, opening the door, perceived Oswald Carew and Sir Giles Taplow wrestling and fighting \u2014 actually fight ing \u2014 for the possession of some sheets of paper which the baronet tightly clutched. The gentlemen walked asunder, looking foolish and ahemming. But it was useless to"], [233, "HELEN'S EXPLANATION. 223 ignore that they had been struggling ; and to have urged that they had only been doing so for fun would hardly, under the circumstances, have been a felicitous excuse. Sir Giles brazened it out : 1 I'm very sorry, Lady Hartleigh \u2014 but it's not my fault. When I heard of what had hap pened to poor Charlie, I made up my mind to say nothing about it ' ' Nothing about what ?' inquired Helen, with the dignity of calm astonishment. 'Well, ahem, I'd rather not have told you, but the fact is Carew and I had some words this morning. I had nearly forgotten all about it, and had come over to inquire about poor Hart leigh, when I was shown in here, and my gentle man here, who it seems had been lying in wait for me, suddenly springs up and asks me to \" make good \" my words of this morning \u2014 thoughtless words, you know, spoken in a mo ment of temper ' ' And before two witnesses, don't forget that, please,' interrupted Oswald ; ' don't forget either that, spoken as you spoke them, the words were heartlessly cruel and base if true, foully slander ous if false, and that I had ground to apprehend you would make use of them to the destruction of Lord Hartleigh's peace of mind, without any better object than that of gratifying your mali cious spite.'"], [234, "777.47\" ARTFUL VICAR. \u25a0224 ' Sir Giles Taplow's words concerned my husband, then ? ' asked Helen, still betraying no other emotion than that of great surprise. ' They concerned you, Lady Hartleigh.' ' And pray how ? ' ' You had better speak out frankly,' said Oswald to Sir Giles. ' Concealment would be of no use now.' ' Egad, since you force me to it,' began the baronet, despairingly, and playing a dumb tune with his nervous fingers on his waistcoat buttons, 'I \u2014 I have a letter which Mr. Rushbrand com municated to me \u2014 in strict privacy, of course \u2014 and when Carew gave me the lie direct I just showed it him to prove that I had not lied.

I could swear that Mr. Rushbrand never showed it you, much less en trusted it to your keeping.' ' And I'll swear that he did. Of course he can deny it, but denials won't alter facts, as they told the cat when they saw him sitting near the empty cream-jug.' ' If the letter concerns me you will allow that I have a right to see it. Pray, give it me, Sir Giles,' said Helen, and she held out her hand for it. Her manner was so collected, and she fixed her eyes on the baronet with such a quiet air of"], [235, "HELEN'S EXPLANATION. 225 command that he surrendered the letter. After all, its possession was a matter of no great mo ment to him, now that he was aware of its con tents and had shown others that he was aware of them. He would trust to his own effrontery to swear through thick and thin \u2014 even before the Vicar's own face \u2014 that the letter had been confidentially entrusted to him, and it would be no easy matter to prove the contrary. Not withstanding these honest reflections, which spoke to the high-souledness of the man in crises of personal danger, Sir Giles did cower much like a knave whilst Helen turned over the thin leaves of her father's missive. A faint blush had risen to her pale cheeks, and her hands trembled a little ; but she gave no other tokens of fear or detected guiltiness. When she had perused as much of the writing as alluded to herself, she sighed, folded the let ter, and looked straight at the baronet. ' As the letter is not addressed to you, Sir Giles, I will keep it and restore it to the owner myself; and I must say that if Mr. Rushbrand gave it into your hands he acted as no gentle man would have done.' ' Ecod, you know the facts mentioned there alarmed him, and he was anxious for my advice,' answered Sir Giles, as if, in making this half apology for the Vicar, he was adding to the credibility of his own narrative. vol. 11. Q"], [236, "226 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. ' Don't believe a word he says, Lady Hart leigh,' broke out Oswald, disgusted by what he guessed to be barefaced falsehoods. ' Rush brand is not the man to ask Taplow 's advice in any emergency.' ' He would choose a curious counsellor if he did,'' replied Helen simply ; ' but, Captain Carew, as your sisters are staying in my house, I owe you an answer to the question which your courtesy has refrained from putting to me as to when my first husband died. He died within two years of our marriage, and my poor little girl was taken from me soon after her father. I have the certificates of their decease and burial, and showed both to Lord Hartleigh be fore I married him.' Oswald bowed. He had expected some such answer, and whether it were a true or false one was no business of his. It saved appear ances, and that was enough. Respecting all the doings of women, Oswald held to the opi nion that a man is justified in being particular about his own wife and his sisters, but that to meddle for defamatory purposes with the femi nine belongings of other men is not meet, seeing that when a woman has to be hunted down and her reputation torn to shreds, her fellow-women may be trusted to do the work without mascu line assistance. He was not one of those who stand in club windows and discourse of the"], [237, "HELEN'S EXPLANATION. 227 other sex's frailties, mentioning this one and that one by name : he left that to those who have never benefited by such frailties, and there fore censure them in the same spirit as the fox did the grapes. Whoever the woman might be who had a thorny path to cross, he threw the mantle of his indulgence under her feet, and was glad if he could help her to trip lightly over it, unscathed. Helen thanked him with an inclination of the head for his evident acceptance of her words, and passed on to a cupboard which she unlocked and drew from a mahogany chest within the bottle of tincture for which Dr. Twix was waiting. In returning, she said a few words to Oswald by way of answer to an inquiry as to Lord Hartleigh's condition, and bidding him again to make himself at home in the house, left the room, taking no more notice of Sir Giles than if he had been stock or stone. q 2"], [238, "228 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. CHAPTER XXXIX. IN EXTREMIS. The baronet mumbled something about being glad that the fuss was over, and said that he meant to see Amy. But Oswald told him this was out of the question. Amy and her sisters had been greatly agitated by Lord Hart leigh's accident, and it was not desirable that their feelings should be harrowed by anything in the nature of a scene. Sir Giles mentally deliberated whether he should disregard this hint and walk boldly into the drawing-room, telling Oswald in polite language to go and be hanged, or, returning home, write his betrothed a dolorous letter to complain of the manner in which he had been vexed and insulted. He re flected that he had still a good many trumps in his hands, and that his game was by no means lost if he played carefully. But precipitation might spoil everything. He had slept off the effects of his brandy \u2014 that was the truth of it \u2014 and was no longer so keen for fearless action, nor so confident in the power of his own elo-"], [239, "IN EXTREMIS. 229 quence as when he marched about his rooms improvising speeches full of pathetic 'points.' On the whole, dignified sulkiness seemed to him a good card to play for the present ; accord ingly he went home and sulked to the top of his bent, but whether with dignity or no, the ser vants on whom he vented his ill-humour were best qualified to judge. Oswald said nothing to his sisters about having seen Sir Giles : Amy believed him to be still in London, for he had not announced with certainty the day of his return. She was in the drawing-room, and had been crying sadly with Mrs. Warrener and Mrs. Hunt, for they had known Lord Hartleigh from his childhood, and nothing of what had recently happened had been able to destroy their affectionate regard for the man, who had been their playmate when they were little girls. It was horrible to think that he was going to die. The Duke of Grand ton said what he could by manner of consolation, but could hold out no chance of recovery. Blaming ' that booby Twix ' for having been so outspoken in the presence of Hartleigh's wife, he was fain to confess that when a horse rolls on the top of a man it is much as if he rolled on the top of an egg, and there is small chance of mend ing the breakages. Father Culfield also tendered soothing words, but his Reverence was more fitted to"], [240, "777.47\" ARTFUL VICAR. 230 shine in the sunny scenes of life than in the dark and stormy ones. His experience also taught him that English ladies resent it as pre sumption when any clergyman, saving one of the sect to which they belong, ventures to console them on religious grounds. All he durst say was that he had heard of some wonderful cures of men who had broken their bones, but he did not risk being frowned at by submitting that we are all mortal \u2014 that death is but a departure from a land of trouble to a haven of joy, or any other controvertible proposition, which, if emitted by an Anglican divine, might have caused the ladies to cheer up somewhat. However, Father Culfield was a man of resource, and could not let slip this solemn occasion without converting it to the advantage of his Church. He glided out of the drawing-room, walked softly upstairs, and knelt on the floor of the room adjoining Lord Hartleigh's in silent prayer. Everyone who entered the sick chamber was obliged to pass him. His bowed head with its tonsure, his flowing cassock and silk sash, and the small ebony crucifix between his clasped hands, offered a picture suggestive enough to make the blood curdle. Presently Helen came out and saw him. He rose and took one of her hands paternally between both of his, at which the first tears that had gleamed in her eyes that day gushed from"], [241, "IN EXTREMIS. 231 them. The influence of the Catholic priest over her was very strong, and in the main a bene ficial one. She beckoned him to follow her into the next room, and led him up to the bed on the opposite side to that where Dr. Twix stood, motionless as a wax image, clasping the patient's wrist in one hand and with the other holding his watch. Here she spoke in broken whispers : \u2014 ' Father, if a miracle could save him ! I am sure he would ascribe it to your prayers.' ' We must not despair of miracles,' answered the Father, gently. ' They are being constantly vouchsafed us in the case of men who recover when physicians have abandoned them. Have you any objection to my staying in the room ? ' ' None. Pray remain. I should so like him to see you here if he awakes ! ' ' Let me put this between his hands, that his eyes may rest on it first,' said the Father. He tried to insert his crucifix into the hand that continued to clutch at the counterpane with changeless, febrile motion ; but the fingers would not close over it. He then laid the holy symbol on the patient's breast, and it remained there. Dr. Twix eyed it as if it was an evil talisman that was going to nullify all the good effects of the treatment which he had begun to pursue. ' Pulse is quickening, my lady,' he said, in a tremulous voice."], [242, "232 777.4 7\" ARTFUL VICAR. 'Is that a good sign?' asked Helen, re moving her handkerchief from her eyes. ' The beatings had almost stopped half an hour ago,' answered the physician. 'And since I have entered the room, I have noticed a change for the better in the face,' remarked Father Culfield, stealing noiselessly to the head of the couch. He laid the white palm of his hand with the lightest touch on the patient's forehead, and kept it there a moment, gazing upwards : \u2014 ' If he recovered, he would join me in em bracing the true religion,' faltered Helen, in a voice audible only to the priest. ' Oh, that he could regain consciousness just long enough only to be baptized, and take the Sacrament ! ' murmured Father Culfield, thinking, perhaps, what a fine stepping-stone it would be to his future monsignorship if he gained credit from the Catholic papers for having con verted this young peer in extremis. ' I will pray fervently,' added he \u2014 and dropping to his knees on the fur rug by the bedside, he rested his brow on the red satin coverlet, and lifted his clasped hands above his head. He remained in this attitude an unconscion able time. An English Churchman would be come ill from such posturing, and a Dissenter would have contracted permanent stiffening of the knee-joints from it. But at genuflexions"], [243, "IN EXTRE.VIS. 233 Father Culfield was a proficient. His knees had each a horny patch on them, like the soles of peasants who go barefooted ; and many and many a time in the days of his noviciate at the seminary, where the ' postulants ' try to outdo one another in zeal, he had knelt the whole night through on the cold flags of the chapel in adoration before the Virgin on the Lady Altar. Kneeling was no harder to him than sitting is to other men ; but the intensity of faith and earnestness which seemed to be implied by his long stations upon his knee-caps, and by the utter imperviousness to all sights and sounds, which characterised him whilst he thus knelt, never failed in its effect upon those who were already predisposed in the reverend Father's favour. It is true that persons who were not of his way of thinking rejoiced but faintly in these attitudinizings,\u2014 e.g., ihe Duke of Grandton, who, coming up three times within two hours to see how Lord Hartleigh was, and finding Father Culfield each time in the same posture, said to Oswald Carew : ' Queer fellow, that popish parson ; he's gone to sleep on his knees ! ' Darkness had long set in, and the rooms were lighted by wax candles, when the Father at length stood up, with a deep red flush mark ing the line of his brow which had rested on the quilted coverlet. A decided change for the"], [244, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 234 better was noticeable in Lord Hartleigh's ap pearance ; he looked \u2014 said the priest \u2014 like a man who has been ' prayed back ' to life. Dr. Twix, had he dared speak, would have taken the liberty to attribute the change to other causes ; but Father Culfield's sanctified presence seemed now to pervade the whole apartment, and it would have sounded like a kind of blas phemy to question the good which he had done. He whispered a few words to Helen, who went out to give some orders, and pre sently a servant came in with a silver tray covered with a snowy cloth, on which were a glass of red wine, a plate containing a piece of bread cut into small dice, a liqueur glass full of oil, and a china bowl of water. These the Father proceeded to consecrate, and, having so done, prepared to administer the sacrament. He had just put back the wine-glass on the table after emptying it, when Helen, who had knelt during this private communion (of which she could not partake, being as yet nominally in the old heresy), turned her red eyes towards the patient, and saw that he had awoke. His gaze was riveted on the doings of his Reve rence, of whom he could see but the back and the arms, but whose gestures seemed to puzzle him like the antics of some visionary spectre. Helen uttered a slight cry, which she at once stifled by placing her handkerchief to her"], [245, "IN EXTREMIS. 235 mouth. Quickly rising, she leaned over the bed, and looked into her husband's face : \u2014 ' Charlie, darling, do you feel better ? ' ' What \u2014 is \u2014 the \u2014 matter ? ' answered he, slowly, and with a vacant stare. 'You are not quite well, my darling. Do you suffer pain ? You must tell us.' ' I feel \u2014 so tired,' murmured the young lord, in a voice almost inaudible. * ' Hush, your ladyship ! ' interposed Dr. Twix, betrayed into unceremoniousness by pro fessional anxiety. ' The least conversation may agitate ' ' Yes, we must avoid agitation,' assented Father Culfield, and he locked the door of the room ; then, catching up the bowl of water, dexterously moved to the head of the bed with it. ' Lord Hartleigh, are you in a state to receive the Living Water which refreshes the soul ? ' The dying man made an affirmative move ment of the head. Evidently he understood the words in a literal sense, if so be that he understood at all, and was not simply thirsting for a draught of the cool liquid. ' A little brandy in the water would do no harm,' prosaically remarked Dr. Twix, who was also quite at sea respecting the Reverend Father's intentions. ' I baptize thee in the name of the Holy"], [246, "777.4 7\" ARTFUL VICAR. 236 Trinity,' said the latter, stooping, and tracing a cross with his moistened forefinger on the young lord's forehead. ' Praised be God who has answered my prayers, and given me grace to admit thee a member of His only true Church ! ' ' See, his face brightens, and he appears quite happy, poor darling ! ' observed Helen, eagerly scrutinising the features, and deluding herself into a belief that she saw consent and joy beaming on them. ' Now for the other sacrament,' gently said Father Culfield, who had returned to the table, and fetched the plate with the cubes of bread. ' Take and eat this, the Body that was crucified for thee. Feed on it in thy heart, and may it nourish thee to everlasting life.' The patient unresistingly opened his lips. There was nothing to show that he compre hended, or did not comprehend, why the sacra mental bread was put into his mouth. Father Culfield, whose movements were now brisk and somewhat feverish, took the glass of oil, and administered the Extreme Unction, which con sists in anointing the dying person's hands, forehead, and the soles of his feet. Dr. Twix looked on with the stupefaction of one behold ing the incantations of witchcraft. Up to this time Lord Hartleigh's right hand had never ceased a moment from the regular plucking"], [247, "IN EXTREMIS. 237 motion so mournful to witness for those who know its significance. When, however, Father Culfield had poured the drop of oil into the hand's palm, and laid it back on the counter pane, it remained still. A minute later the eyes had closed again. ' He is going \u2014 to sleep,' murmured Helen, beneath her breath. The young lord had faintly sighed \u2014 a last, quiet sigh."], [248, "238 THA T ARTFUL VICAR. CHAPTER XL. BEFORE THE FUNERAL. It is the conventional rule to write that the deaths of persons in high rank throw a gloom over the localities where they resided. So they do, but this very soon changes to an excitement not altogether unpleasurable. After the first shock caused by the brutality of the Great Leveller in mowing down a man of quality with no more ceremony than if he had been a hod man, the public tongue finds sweet pasture in the circumstances that attended the great man's decease, in speculations about his heir, in won derment as to what bequests may possibly be found in his will. All these elements of interest were furnished forth in abundance by young Lord Hartleigh's untimely demise. It was not known whether her ladyship was in hopes of becoming a mother, and whether consequently the estate would be managed by trustees during a long minority (a bad look-out for neighbour ing tradesmen) or devolve at once upon a cousin of sporting character, who was reputed to be"], [249, "BEFORE THE FUNERAL. 239 free with his money \u2014 or rather with other people's, for of his own, as yet, he had had none. Moreover, there was that curious story as to Lord Hartleigh having died a Catholic, which occasioned quite as much scandal as if his lordship had on his deathbed been circumcised and perverted to Judaism. Stilborough could not stomach this apostasy. The only man who rejoiced in it was Mr. Pot tinger, who did so because of the damage he hoped it would do Paul Rushbrand. It never speaks very highly for a clergyman when im portant members of his flock secede, and there was the new Vicar, who had not been in the place a year, and had already driven the lord of the manor and the mayor of the town out of his fold ! Mr. Pottinger had publicly made his ap pearance at a Baptist place of worship, and the better to emphasise this proceeding had hung his golden chain of office about his neck. If Lady Hartleigh had a son and remained mis tress of Hazelwood Hall, a Romish church would indubitably be built in the town ; there would be more and more departures from Mr. Rushbrand's congregation, and the vindictive grocer flattered himself that he should yet live to see his old foes, Mr. Pettigrew and family, disgrace themselves by embracing the Scarlet Lady. The only drop of gall in his cup was that his daughter Pattie refused to forsake the"], [250, "777.17\" ARTFUL VICAR. 240 Church of England. ' Not if the Queen herself was to go down before me on bended knees and offer me the Bank of England, would I do it' Such were the unambiguous terms in which Miss Martha declined to be inveigled into the red brick chapel wherein stood a tank used by the Rev. Mr. Jowler for 'dipping' his prose lytes. Paul Rushbrand would have been less than human if he had not felt a pang of mortification on hearing of Lord and Lady Hartleigh's per version. The thing looked like a personal slight to himself, and he also grieved for it on Mr. Truman's account. But the latter took a more charitable view than he did, and was glad that religious interest of any sort should have been awakened in his daughter. ' If her conversion signify that she has become a Christian and is anxious to be thought one, God be praised ! ' he said humbly. Paul wanted him to go and see his daughter, but the missionary had been a doting father while his child lived with him, and was afraid that he should be too much overcome at sight of her, and also cause her needless distress. Oswald Carew was asked whether Lady Hart leigh was aware that her father had returned to England, and he answered that he thought not. He had described the interview in which Sir Giles had produced and surrendered Mr. Tru-"], [251, "BEFORE THE FUNERAL. 241 man's miscarried letter ; but he could not remem ber that any word had been said about Mr.. Truman's presence in the town. At Paul's private request, however, and agreeably to his own notions of what was right, he resolved to try and bring about a meeting between father and child. Oswald had free access to Helen, for she had made him her factotum for the present. Naturally flattered by the resolute way in which he had taken her part against Sir Giles, and won by his gentlemanlike manners, equally free from stiffness and presumption, she had accepted his obliging offer to put his services at her disposal ; nor were his functions a sinecure, for there is always much to be done in a mansion where a young widow is left without any male relative of her own or of her husband's to advise her. Father Culfield had gone to London to make arrangements for the funeral, which was to be solemnised with all the pomp of the Romish ritual ; and, but for Oswald, Helen would have been alone in the house with the Dowager Lady Hartleigh and the heir-presumptive of sporting character, who was in dreadful distress at being told that some months must elapse before it could be known for certain whether he was to succeed to the title and entailed property. The Dowrager would have nothing to say to Helen, though Oswald exerted all the diplomatic arts VOL. II. R"], [252, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 242 he knew to bring about a reconciliation. She remained in the left wing of the house with a meek superannuated governess whom she had engaged as companion, and the utmost conces sion that could be extracted from her was that on the day when the will was read she would condescend to bow to the widow, so as to pre vent saucy tongues from wagging too long and loud at the expense of the great family of Hart leigh ; ' though as to that,' added her ladyship, in a voice between a lamentable whine and a shriek, ' my poor son's wife has done more to get us talked about than any previous wearer of the name \u2014 man, woman, or child in arms.' Oswald's duties towards the heir-presump tive of sporting character were to answer his never-flagging questions as to the probabilities of Helen's being in an interesting condition. The hapless gentleman had been summoned from abroad, where he was rusticating for reasons not wholly unknown to his creditors, and he had travelled down to Hazelwood under the exciting belief that he was already Lord Hartleigh, and was steaming down to meet an income of 30,000/. His disappointment was all the more touching as he was a good-hearted, well-man nered fellow, who kept his anxieties to himself except in Oswald's company, and towards Helen especially showed himself correctly and feelingly deferential. But whenever he could catch hold"], [253, "BEFORE THE FUNERAL. 243 of Oswald (with whom he had been at school), he would break out into heartrending lamenta tions over the anomalous nature of his position, and dialogues like the following would ensue : \u2014 ' I say, old man, you have not noticed any thing yet ? ' ' Why, you put me that question an hour ago. How could I have noticed anything since ? ' ' Women are such queer cattle, you see, and I don't understand their ways. How do the odds stand ? Will you lay two to one on me in ponies ? ' ' Why, I laid even on you yesterday in mon keys.' ' Yes, but I hoped I might have risen in the betting since then. By Jove, it will be fearfully hard lines on me if I'm beaten on the post by the Posthumous Colt ! ' At other times the heir-presumptive would grow utterly desponding, and exclaim : \u2014 ' I wish to goodness Cousin Helen would bring to birth a fellow twenty-one years old straight off' ' Why, how would that improve your case ? ' ' 'Gad, it would put me out of my misery. Just consider what my life will be if a boy brat is born. All the time of his childhood I shall be wondering whether hooping-cough, measles.

I don't desire anybody's death, goodness knows ; and if old Pluto, Charon, or whatever his name is, had put poor Charlie's death to the vote I should have voted for his living a hundred years if he wished it.

Why, that ass Casewell actually tele graphed to me as \" Lord Hartleigh,\" and I was \" my-lorded \" by my man all the way to England. Deuced hard lines, 'pon my soul ! ' Oswald solaced these noble griefs as best he could, and Rupert Hartleigh (such was the heir's name) followed him about for the crumbs of comfort as a dog might. Whenever Oswald went into Stilborough, Rupert went with him ; he likewise accompanied him to Royster Hall, and, having nothing better to do, fell in love with Isabel Carew, who was a year older than Amy. Amy and her sisters had of course re turned to Royster, and were in great excitement about the proceedings of the diggers, who had now been boring and exploring all about the estate for nearly a week without finding any of the Boghead mineral. Rupert was made ac quainted with the chequered history of ' Stubbs's Piece,' and laughed thereat, offering to lay any body a fiver that Rodgie was a ' welsher ' ; but he deprecated any more turning up of sods in the vicinity of the racecourse."], [255, "BEFORE THE FUNERAL. 245 ' To spoil such a course for a few scuttlefuls of coal : egad, it's a sin ! ' said he. ' But with the coal to be got from under this surface we could make a dozen new courses,' submitted Oswald mildly. ' No, that I defy you to do,' cried Rupert, glancing round him with the eye of a connois seur. ' That is to say, you'll never make such a good course as this is. There are not three in England to beat it.' ' That was not the opinion of your cousin, Mr. Hartleigh,' observed Isabel demurely. ' She tried very hard to have the races trans ferred to Hazelwood.' ' Let bygones be bygones, Bella : we have heard enough of that story,' said Oswald. ' Ladies have no eye for a good course. Trees and picturesque points of view, that's their style,' observed Rupert. ' If Hazelwood becomes mine, heigho ! \u2014 (here a rueful sigh) \u2014 I shan't make courses out of it so long as this one's available.' ' Qui vivra verra' smiled Oswald. ' If you don't pull off the grand event, that is, if you don't get Hazelwood, you ought to be allowed to win consolation stakes \u2014 in other words, have a legacy out of the estate, Mr. Hartleigh,' said Isabel, archly, adopting the slang of the turf to mock him.

I should cry all the time if I went to poor Lord Hartleigh's. Only to think that this day a week ago Alice and Amy dined with him, and that he was in the best spirits. It's dreadful to think of;' and tears started to her eyes. ' I shall be chief mourner,' remarked Rupert, in a softened voice. ' But I say, Carew, they shan't put me in one of those black coaches, nor rig me out in a cloak. As he died in the field, we'll follow him on horse back \u2014 all the South Stilshire Hunt \u2014 in pink coats with crape round the left arm, eh ? ' ' I expect you'll have to get Father Cul field's consent to that,' answered Oswald. 'He is master of the ceremonies, and I believe means to bring down a bishop to officiate.' Father Culfield was in truth making pre parations on a gorgeous scale, so that the pomp of the interment might unmistakably blazon forth the triumph of Rome. The dowager, though shocked at the perversion of her son, had no objection to offer to the mode of his obse quies, for at heart she would rather that anyone read the burial service over his grave sooner"], [257, "BEFORE THE FUNERAL. 247 than Mr. Rushbrand. Helen regarded the im posing Romish funeral as a grand advertise ment to the whole world of the power which she had exercised over her late husband ; for nobody supposed that the conversion had been an affair extemporised at the dying bedside. It was believed that the young lord had been won over to Rome many weeks at least before his death ; and Dr. Twix, who could have told a different story, had (by Father Culfield's ad vice) received such a princely fee for his dubious services, that he was not the man to tell it. Howbeit Helen felt a slight qualm when, in the midst of her Romanisings, Oswald informed her that her father was in Stilborough, and had been staying there for the past ten days. She had been quite ignorant of this ; for Oswald's sisters, guessing that there must be some estrangement between father and daughter to keep them apart when so close to each other, had held their lips sealed during their visit, though they knew by that time that the Mr. Truman at the Vicarage and Helen's father were one and the same person. It was on the eve of the funeral that Oswald brought his unexpected tidings. Helen, having shed fitful showers of tears during the greater part of a week, had worn off the first edge of her grief, and was able to look with"], [258, "248 777.4 7\" ARTFUL VICAR. tolerable calmness at her present position. In her rich black silk dress, with its deep crape trimmings, and with the traces of weeping still visible on her ladylike features, she wore a subdued, chastened aspect which captivated sympathy. Oswald suggested that she ought to see her father ; and she assented with a kind of eager ness before he had adduced any one of the many reasons he had feared might be neces sary. ' See him, why of course I will ! What can have possessed Mr. Rushbrand to keep me in ignorance of my dear father's presence under his roof ? ' ' It has been Mr. Rushbrand's desire from the first that Mr. Truman should come to Hazelwood ; but it was feared that the visit might agitate you.' ' Agitate me \u2014 why ? Because my poor father and I had a difference about my first marriage ? Oh, that is a long-forgotten story, Captain Carew ; and I, for my part, have freely forgiven everything \u2014 everything, I assure you.' ' There is no making out this woman,' mused Oswald. But aloud he said : ' Then shall I ask Mr. Truman to call, Lady Hart leigh ? ' ' Why, certainly, please do, or, rather, I will write a letter, and beg you to carry it,"], [259, "BEFORE THE FUNERAL. 249 which will be more dutiful than sending it through a servant.

Most extra ordinary it was, to be sure, on the part of Mr. Rushbrand.' She seemed determined to find fault with the Vicar, and continued to rattle on about his breach of duty the whole time she was tracing a ten-line note in very slim letters upon a sheet of paper with a black border half an inch broad. But when she had folded the sheet in two, put it into a square crested envelope, and seen Oswald depart with it in his care, a dark look stole over her face, and she murmured : \u2014 ' After all, poor Charlie's death was perhaps for the best ! If my father has been telling my story to that meddlesome Vicar and all his friends, some of it would have been sure to reach his ears, and we should have had no more peace together.

Now that we are met again, we must see each other often, eh ? ' Thus Helen Hartleigh to her father after a ten years' separation. She shed a few tears because he looked so aged, so shabby in his attire, and so deeply moved ; but not a word of penitence for the past escaped her lips. She acted as if all the condescension of this inter view were hers, and as though the countless tears she had caused him to pour out, and the utter blight which she had brought upon his life, were trifles not worth alluding to. Mr. Truman had come on the morning of the funeral, thinking his presence might soothe Helen at a trying moment \u2014 and so it did \u2014 but"], [261, "FATHER AND CHILD. 251 not by reviving recollections of her childhood, and softening her heart with thoughts of how much more kindly Providence had dealt with her than she deserved. Her father's visit dis pelled sorrowful meditations by summoning up her vanity to help her play the fine lady and dazzle the poor old man, who would have deemed her so much fairer and more loveable if she had come to him with tattered garments and streaming eyes to sue his pardon, and ask him for shelter and comfort. Though all the world should have cast her out, he would have taken her to his bosom, and wept with ineffable grati tude over the lost one which was found \u2014 over his poor little ewe lamb which went astray, and had been restored to him again. But he felt more awkward than with a total stranger in the presence of this splendidly dressed, flighty, talkative young woman who called him papa, and whom servants addressed as ' Your ladyship.'

She was not going to attend the funeral (English etiquette wisely enjoining the absence of widows from such distressing or deals), but she was to appear in the dining room afterwards, when the will would be read ; and she thought it fortunate that her father had come, for it would look respectable to walk in leaning upon his arm. But she cast another look at his clothes, and wished that his coat were not so threadbare and greasy about the collar. ' How did you come to Hazelwood, papa dear ? ' she said. ' I came in a fly, with Rushbrand, who is going to the funeral.' ' Mr. Rushbrand ? But is he not aware that the service will be performed by Catholic clergymen ? ' ' Yes ; but he is only going in his private capacity, out of respect to Lord Hartleigh, who was patron of his living.' ' I should have thought him too self-satisfied to perform such an act of good grace,' remarked Helen, contemptuously. ' But by the way, papa dear, you are not angry with me for having become a Catholic ? ' ' What right have I to be angry, my dear child ? You are old enough to choose the forms of worship which you think best calcu lated to inspire you with faith.'"], [263, "FATHER AND CHILD. 253 ' That is exactly it, papa dear ; and I really can never feel anything like holy enthusiasm except at Catholic church services. Your Anglican ritual is too cold, and then so much depends on the manners of the clergymen whom one happens to know.

' You don't appear to like Mr. Rushbrand, Helen, and I wonder at it ; for he speaks most affectionately of you,' remonstrated Mr. Tru man, gently but firmly. ' If you saw the letter which he wrote me, announcing your marriage, you would admit that a brother could not have written of his sister in terms of more cordial earnestness.' ' Ah, yes, papa. Brother, sister, cordial earnestness \u2014 that's just the man all over,' rejoined Helen, with a shrug. ' I can't bear that sort of clergyman. If I had given him the least encouragement, he would have clung to me like a hair-shirt, for ever patronising, ad monishing, advising, preaching.' Mr. Truman made no reply. He had ceased to wonder at anything his daughter might do or say, and felt it would be useless to argue with her about her prejudices. Helen perceived how great was her father's attach ment to the Vicar of Stilborough, and did not like the latter any the better for it. Her anti-"], [264, "254 777/4 7\" ARTFUL VICAR. pathy was founded on a dread of the man whom she had so brazenly deceived, and who now knew so much about her. She hated him, too, because of that letter which had miscarried, just as though it had miscarried through his fault. But the mere fact that he should be on such a footing of intimacy with her father as to have received so confidential a letter from him made him obnoxious in her sight. ' You must not continue to live with Mr. Rushbrand, papa dear,' she said, presently ; and, drawing nearer to him, \" You know I am going to have at least twenty thousand a year of my own now, and we must make you very comfort able wherever you would like to reside.' ' It's very kind of you, my dear ; but I have enough for my needs, which are not large,' said the Missionary, humbly. ' Don't say it's kind of me, papa ; for you know whatever I have is yours. I will tell Mr. Casewell to buy you the immediate pre sentation to a good living in some pleasant place where there is a pretty parsonage, and not much to do.' ' I am past parish work, however light, my dear, but thank you all the same,' was the Missionary's not very eager reply. ' Oh, but you must not baulk me of my wish to see that you are well cared for, as a daughter is in duty bound,' exclaimed Helen,"], [265, "FATHER AND CHILD. 255 pretty resolutely. 'You must be well clothed and housed, papa, \u2014 have your servants, your carriage, and all the particular comforts which you may desire.

' Well, then, you won't refuse, papa dear ; and you will let me do for you all I wish, eh ? Remember that I am a lady of rank now \u2014 a peeress \u2014 and that it would reflect discredit on me if my father were not placed in a position of suitable comfort' Mr. Truman did not seek to reject his daughter's considerate proposals, for he could not have done so without deeply paining her, which it was very far from his wish to do. He was even grateful that she exhibited so much concern on his behalf ; but to say that he felt any hankering after the luxuries which her lively tongue conjured up before his imagina tion, would be incorrect ; for he had lived a life of so great simplicity, that any change for the better was rather calculated to inconve nience him.

The conversation between father and child was cut short by the cessation of the hum, as of many distant voices, that had pervaded the house, and by the increase of noise outside in the park, where numerous gentlemen were mounting their horses. Helen and Mr. Tru man sat listening in silence \u2014 she supporting the elbow of her right arm with her left hand, and resting her bowed face on her right hand. The clock was not yet marking the hour fixed for the start ; but it was evident the majority of eques trians were getting into the saddle so that there might be no confusion at the last moment. Mr. Truman rose softly, and took up his hat. He had not intended going to the ceme tery, thinking it might be his duty to stay with his daughter, and comfort her ; but she gave no such signs of grief as argued her to be in too great distress to be left alone, and, under the circumstances, his place was with the other mourners. He approached Helen, and kissed her. ' I think it is time for me to be gone, my dear.' ' Very well, papa. Mind you come back afterwards, to hear the will read.' ' I will, if you wish it, my dear.

By common consent there had never been seen such a funeral in Stilshire as that of Lord Hart leigh \u2014 that is to say, not since the barbarous ages when men dressed in gold and silver, and could summon hundreds of monks, retainers, falconers, squires, archers and page-boys to howl dirges behind their coffins. The procession stretched nearly a mile. First trudged two dozen choristers swinging censers by silver chains, carrying crosses, and bearing aloft huge candlesticks with tapers, which had been lighted before the start, but which the wind unceremo niously snuffed out on the threshold of the house. Next marched a guard of honour of the Stilborough Rifle Corps, with arms reversed \u2014 a not very martial body of warriors in grey and red, and as various in size as the contents of a bag of ' all sorts ' biscuits. After them rode another guard of honour of the County Yeo manry \u2014 sturdy fellows weighing from twelve to sixteen stone, dressed in blue frogged tunics"], [269, "7777: READING OF THE WILL. 259 and brass helmets, and bestriding rough beasts more accustomed to the voice of the ploughman than to the sound of funeral chaunt. At the tail of the hindmost yeoman's horse came a depu tation of freemasons with strange aprons, gaunt lets and symbols ; then the hearse, drawn by six plumed and richly caparisoned horses ; and im mediately behind it Rupert Hartleigh, alone on horseback and bareheaded, looking most doleful in the long cloak that concealed his hunting costume, for the undertaker had turned a deaf ear to all his prayers to be excused from the disfigurement of this apparel. After this a four horsed mourning coach rolled by containing Father Culfield, a Catholic mitred bishop very gorgeous to behold, Mr. Truman in black gloves many sizes too large for him, and Mr. Mayor Pottinger with his gold chain on \u2014 all four gentlemen mightily, though silently, surprised to be in one another's company. After this other mourning coaches and private carriages, and then a sight which no other country but this could offer, namely, some three hundred and fifty gentlemen of the different Stilshire Hunts, all superbly mounted and dressed as for the chase, excepting that they wore black gloves and knotted crape scarves on their left arms. The Duke of Grandton had stood out more success fully than Rupert Hartleigh against the prepos terous cloaks and hat-bands wherewith the under- S 2"], [270, "7T/-.4 7\" ARTFUL VICAR. 260 taker was so anxious to clothe the foremost members of the cavalcade, ' for,' as his Grace remarked, ' there being not enough of such ugly garments for everybody, it was better that all should do without them than that the uniform sightliness of the procession should be marred.' And truly enough it was a spectacle most sightly to witness, this brave squadron of sportsmen riding six abreast, with grave faces but miens erect, full of health and life. Behind the sports men jogged a mixed troop of farmers and tradesmen, mostly on cobs, and of course be cloaked and be-hat-banded out of all recognition. Some of them, who could manage their steeds with one hand, even held handkerchiefs to their noses with the other, under the impression that it was the correct thing to do. The day was rainless, but murky and cold, with a slight tendency to fogginess. By the time the hearse, after passing through densely packed lanes of sightseers, had reached the ceme tery \u2014 at whose gates a perfect army of grooms and farm-boys were in attendance to hold the horses of all who cared to dismount and enter \u2014 by this time the tendency to fogginess had be come a settled purpose of fog, and the leaders of the procession grew invisible to those behind, while the coachman of the hearse loomed hazily like the figure of a man taking a vapour bath. All this occasioned a curtailment of the burial"], [271, "THE READING OF THE WILL. 261 service, and a suppression of the sermon which the bishop had been minded to deliver on the precariousness of human existence. Nothing was done beyond reciting a few prayers and pronouncing the absolution ; then choristers went round with pots of holy water, and all who chose to do so took the asperges brushes and scattered a few pious drops on the coffin before it was lowered. The whole ceremony did not last twenty minutes, and was prevented from being imposing by reason of the stifling crowd, whose massive, unorganised movements threat ened at one time to be dangerous. The Stil borough Cemetery had not been built in view of such grand pageants ; the approaches to it were narrow, and so great a mob had encumbered the ground and its neighbourhood before the pro cession arrived that not a fifth of the gentlemen on horseback could dismount, while those who did get into the cemetery found themselves as though entrapped and hardly able to get out again. The bishop, his chaplains, and Father Culfield elbowed out their way as they could by the aid of friendly policemen ; the choristers, preferring speed to dignity, gave one another ' legs-up ' and clambered over the walls, the damp moss whereof did not improve the com plexions of their laced surplices and red cassocks.

Fully two hours elapsed before he managed to get out, and he was in dreadfully low spirits, for everybody had saluted him and condoled with him as if he had actually inherited the de ceased's title and wealth. Shivering in the dank gathering mist, and cutting the drollest figure of a guy with the long band on his hat and the shapeless cloak that draped his limbs, he conveyed to Oswald how inexpressibly dis heartening it was to be made the plaything of Fortune in this way. ' You'll see, old man, Cousin Helen will be brought to bed of twin boys, and I shan't get a stiver ; that will be the end of it' ' I have heard that when little women of her temperament exceed the number one they gene rally produce triplets,' said Oswald, gravely. ' Be hanged to you for an unfeeling beggar, to laugh at my wretchedness,' growled Rupert. 1 I should like to see you in my place.' ' So should I. I would exchange skins with you pretty willingly.'

I shall get the blues if I dine alone again in that big dining room of ours.' ' All right,' answered Oswald ; ' but I see an opening there, and I think by forcing a little we shall be able to get out.'

Al though both he and Oswald were in haste to reach their destination, the roads were not yet so clear as to admit of their riding fast, so that what with the long delaying and the fog it was almost dark when they arrived at the Hall, both mortally hungry, for they had not eaten since breakfast. Oswald was at once consigned to the compassionate butler, who babbled about a nice little cutlet and a glass of claret ; but Rupert was not allowed to refresh his drooping forces, being told that the family were all assembled in the dining-room and waiting for him. He only gave himself time to rush upstairs and exchange his red coat for a black cutaway, and scampered down again. The ' family ' consisted of a few collateral Hartleighs who could have but little personal interest in the proceedings, and who were unknown to him, though he dimly recol lected shaking hands with some of them that morning, when scores of hands which he had never touched in his life had been thrust into his and had gripped his fingers with mute sym pathy. The Dowager Lady Hartleigh was also present in the dining-room, but Helen had not yet made her appearance. She entered in a minute, resting on the arm of her aged father, and then came her first meet ing with her late husband's mother. Both ladies bowed to each other with cold ceremoniousness,"], [275, "7777s READING OF THE WILL. 265 but Helen had rather the best of it in point of dignity ; for the Dowager, hating the ' imp of a woman ' who had decoyed her son from her, infused too much stiffness into her courtesy, whereas Helen, whose sentiments towards her mother-in-law did not rise to the importance of hatred, showed herself quite calm and natural. She was also very gracefully affable towards the collaterals, who had been pulling her to pieces in whispers before she entered, and who now felt rather touched by her pretty face crowned by its aureola of golden hair, and by the most beAvitching little Avidow's cap that Avas ever donned to signify consolable grief. Lady Hartleigh was seated in an arm-chair near the fire, shading her face nonchalantly Avith a Chinese screen ; Helen took her place at the further end of the table, opposite Mr. Casewell, the solicitor, Avith his mottled tin box. Mr. Truman, Rupert Hartleigh, and the other rela tions seated themselves as they pleased ; then Helen Avaved one of her small gloved hands to the laAvyer as a signal to begin. Mr. CaseAvell bowed, unlocked the tin box, and drew out two long blue envelopes sealed. He Avas a middle-aged, handsome, urbane man of the world, and a capital reader. He made short Avork of the Avill.

There was not a single direct legacy in it. The collaterals turned towards Helen like so many sunflowers towards the earth's rising luminary, and gave vent to a complimentary murmur. Rupert smiled resignedly, and the Dowager bit her lips, gathering up her skirts at the same time, as if to go. But Mr. Casewell lifted a hand to intimate that the proceedings Avere not at an end, and took up the second envelope, on which Helen had been keeping her eyes fixed Avith some curiosity. ' Lady Hartleigh,' said he, smoothly ad dressing her, ' here is a parcel which his lord ship sent me about a month ago, with instruc tions that it should be opened at his death.' ' My husband sent it you ? ' exclaimed she involuntarily, and with a change of colour. ' Yes ; but I am quite unaAvare of its con tents,' replied the lawyer. ' Perhaps I shall do well to read the letter of advice which accom panied it' And, drawing a letter from a pocket-book of his own, he read this : \u2014"], [277, "THE READING OF THE WILL. 267 Hazelwood Hall, December 9, 18 \u2014 , ' My dear Sir, ' I shall soon require your advice re specting the disposal of a certain part of my personal estate. Meamvhile, lest sudden death should overtake me before I have completed the arrangements which I am meditating, I send you the enclosed parcel, to be opened only after my funeral, in the event of such sudden death occurring. ' Yours very faithfully, ' Hartleigh.' Having perused this epistle amidst a silence so complete that a gnat could have been heard to fly, Mr. CaseAvell broke the blue envelope, drew a paper from it, and said, quietly, ' A second will ! ' Helen turned livid. Whatever might be the contents of this other will, it could not be so favourable to her as the first, and a hideous fear seized her that, as a punishment for the deceit which she had practised on her husband, in order to induce him to marry her, he might have disinherited her. She could not master her agitation, but ejaculated : \u2014 ' Before reading that paper, Mr. Casewell, Avill you look to see that it is properly Avit nessed ?' ' Two signatures suffice, but there are three"], [278, "268 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. here,' replied the lawyer, turning over the leaves. ' The witnesses are \"William Prender son,\" \" James Johnson,\" \" Charles Herbert.\" Mr. Prenderson is the solicitor in Stilborough, and perhaps the other two are his clerks.' ' And does this Avill bear a later date than the other?' continued Helen, faintly. ' Yes, this is dated \" The ninth December.\" ' ' Helen made no rejoinder ; and a silence more intense than the first ensued Avhile the lawyer began to read. This new will was much longer than the other, and its formal language proved that it had been written under the dictation of a lawyer, although from the first line to the last it Avas all penned in Lord Hartleigh's hand. It commenced by providing for the event of a child being born to the testator after his death ; and very minute directions Avere given as to the child's education ; these instructions showing plainly enough that the testator's con fidence in his Aviso had been rudely shaken since the date of the first will. It was notably set forth that the child, whether boy or girl, was to be brought up in the religion of the Church of England, and, if a boy, to be sent to Eton, and afterwards to Christ Church, Oxford, or Trinity, Cambridge, as he himself might prefer. Helen was to have for her oAvn use a legacy of 10,000/ and the absolute possession"], [279, "777.\u00a3 READING OF THE WILL. 269 of house property yielding 5,000/. a year. Legacies were further devised to different per sons ; among which figured one of 25,000/. down and 1,000/. a year for life to Rupert Hartleigh, to console him for his disappoint ment if the posthumous birth of a boy pre vented him from inheriting the title ; and one of 10,000/ to Sir Peter Carew, of Royster Hall. In the event, hoAvever, of no child being born to the testator, the disposal of the per sonal property Avas to be as folloAvs : \u2014 Helen Avas to have 10,000/., and 5,000/. a year absolutely, and the enjoyment of the house in toAvn, Avith its furniture, plate, Avines, &c, during her lifetime. After her death the said house was to revert to the possessor of the title. The Rev. William Truman, ' if he could be found,' Avas to receive 10,000/., free of legacy duty, and Avas requested not to lose sight of his daughter, but to exhort her ' in Avays of charity.' Twenty thousand pounds Avas bequeathed to the testator's mother (already amply pro vided for by her marriage settlement), with the prayer that she Avould ' forgive him.' Twenty thousand pounds in sums of 2,000/., and 10,000/., free of duty, were left to different collateral Hartleighs mentioned by name. (All those present at the reading Avere included.)"], [280, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 270 Ten thousand pounds Avere bequeathed in sums varying from ioo/. to 1,000/ to different charities, almost all connected with the Estab lished Church. Finally, the entire residue of the testator's personal estate \u2014 some 14,000/ a year \u2014 Avas left to Sir Peter Carew, ' my father's old friend, Avhom I have always sincerely loved and esteemed, and whose family will, I trust, long flourish in our country.' As he folded up this sensational document, making a low bow to Helen, Mr. Casewell cast his eyes on the company, and saw a very dif ferent collection of faces to that which he had beheld looking so sheepish a few minutes before. The collaterals Avere nervously grin ning from ear to ear; Rupert Hartleigh was red as a poppy from hilarious excitement ; the Dowager shed furtive tears of emotion, and only Helen was downcast and full of rage. Her position was still a splendid one, such as many another widowed peeress might have envied, and one wherewith she herself might have been well satisfied had not the contrast between the first and the second will been so conspicuously to her disadvantage. She rose in silence, and faced the Dowager, Avhose eyes met hers. The glances which these ladies exchanged were like pistol-shots. ' I must say, Lady Hartleigh, my poor son's"], [281, "7777s READING OF THE WILL. 271 will is not much like that of a man Avho thought of joining the Church of Rome,' re marked the elder lady, drying her eyes. ' No, it is not,' answered Helen, as coolly as she could. ' And I make no doubt that if my poor husband had lived, he Avould have can celled that will.' Then, turning towards the late lord's family Avith a forced smile she said, in a tone of voice Avhich was soft, though it thrilled like the over strung cords of an instrument : \u2014 ' I am very glad for all your sakes that this second will was made, for I should really not have known what to do with all the money that was left me at first. Thank you kindly for attending here to-day.' ' 'Egad, it was very neatly done ; and she sailed out of the room Avith quite a grand curt sey,' as Rupert said in describing the ceremony to astonished OsAvald CareAv, Avhose appetite for his second cutlet was considerably blunted by the sudden stroke of good luck Avhich had lighted upon his family."], [282, "272 THAT ARTFUL VICAR.

Another scientific friend treated the question in a review, and demonstrated that soils like that of Stilshire might yield coal under certain given circumstances. The Carews did not read his article, but blessed themselves that Providence had stretched out a hand to them at a very critical moment. Lord Hartleigh's bequests enabled them to reimburse Sir Giles Taplow without trouble. Mrs. Warrener and Mrs. Hunt pitied the baronet, and so did good old Sir Peter in his inmost heart. They could not forget that but"], [283, "A FIRESIDE CONFESSIONAL. 273 for Sir Giles's having so opportunely opened his purse, they Avould have drifted into a shoal of bankruptcy and disgrace, out of which it Avould have been very difficult for any after legacies to have floated them in safety.

In point of fact, he Avas the saviour of Royster Hall. All this Avas very well, but it did not con vince Amy. The reasons which she gave for her antipathy towards Sir Giles did not take so long to enounce as those of the man of science explaining the absence of coal, but were none the less categorical. ' I won't marry Sir Giles,' said she, ' because I don't like him, have never liked him, and ahvays will despise him \u2014 so there ! ' No other reply was possible, excepting that Avhich Sir Peter gave : ' My dear child, nobody Avants to force you into a marriage against your will.' So Sir Giles had to be communicated Avith in a very courteous and cautious letter, by no means devoid of feeling, in Avhich Sir Peter made apologies for Amy, on the ground of her being so young and not in good health, although (simply as a soother) he added the hope that perhaps at a future date she might VOL. it. t"], [284, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 274 feel less disinclined for marriage than at pre sent. No reference was made to the coal business ; but Sir Peter begged to be informed for what sum Sir Giles would consent to part with ' Stubbs's Piece,' which he was most de sirous of adding to his estate. This letter found Sir Giles ill and utterly wretched. He had caught cold going to Hazelwood in the rain on the day of Lord Hartleigh's death, and the cold brought on ague. Whilst he was shivering and groaning by his lonely fireside, he wrote Amy the most dismal of supplicatory letters, which remained unanswered ; and by the time he could crawl out of bed the news of the dead lord's big legacy to the Carews destroyed all the hopes that he had built on the impecuniousness of Amy's relatives. Friendless and weakened in body, having none but servants to tend him, the man shed tears like a child, and felt an absolute craving for words of comfort. He pondered to whom he should write a request to come and visit him in his affliction ; and of all men in the Avorld chose Paul Rushbrand. When the Vicar arrived, expecting, from the forlorn wording of the summons, that he was being called to a death-bed, he beheld a pale disconsolate object imbedded in an arm-chair, with a nightcap on his head, a red check dressing-gown on his limbs, and an array of"], [285, "A FIRESIDE CONFESSIONAL. 275 physic bottles on a table at his elbow. He took the hand proffered him, and there was a mo ment's silence, the baronet feeling half ashamed to commence talking. A bright fire lit up the large bedroom, and Tear'em, who had been stretched on the rug, sniffed about the Vicar's legs and wagged his tail. ' I feel as if I were going to die, Rushbrand,' began Sir Giles, piteously. Paul scanned him closely \u2014 a scrutiny like a physician's. ' You are not going to die, Sir Giles ; you are recovering.' ' I wish I were going to die ' That is another thing.' ' I suppose you think I should be a good riddance ? I own I behaved badly to you last time we met, and I'm sorry for it.' ' Don't let us recur to that subject.' ' No, for I Avas almost out of my mind. I had so many things to try me. I hope you'll make matters right for me with Mr. Truman. Where is he now ?

I suppose you and Mr. Truman wondered how I got hold of that letter that Avas T 2"], [286, "276 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. directed to you. The fact is, the postman put it into my hands by mistake;' and Sir Giles proceeded to give a tolerably accurate version of the affair, Avinding up with the philosophical remark : 'It wasn't right to keep it, I know, but they say all's fair in love and Avar, and I was in love, and fancied several people Avere warring upon me.' ' Providentially no harm came of what you did,' Avas Paul's cold rejoinder ; for he thought that a man capable of urging so poor an excuse for such a base trick Avas not Avorth arguing with. ' And now I am the most miserable man alive,' groaned Sir Giles, plunging suddenly into a brown study. He gazed for some moments at the fire, Avatching the coals fall and the flames leap in fantastic shapes ; then looked up, and asked abruptly, ' Do you play piquet ? ' ' I will play a game if it can amuse you,' answered Paul, noAvise disconcerted. ' Will you ? It's very kind. I'm so utterly lonely and hipped that I could hang myself. You don't mind my smoking ? the doctor says I may now. Perhaps you'll have a cigar your self ? ' ' No, thank you. One pipe a day before bed is my alloAvance.' ' You'll accept a glass of something, then, for company's sake ? Don't say no, or I'll think you bear me a grudge.'"], [287, "A FIRESIDE CONFESSIONAL. 277 ' I bear you no grudge ; but I never take anything between meals.' ' Just for sociability's sake, though. An old sailor won't shirk a glass of weak grog ? ' ' Very well, to keep you company,' said Paul, Avith resignation. The baronet slid out of his chair, and pulled the bell. His valet came, and soon wheeled the table round, disencumbered it of the physic bottles, and substituted two new packs of cards, a tray with glasses, lemons, sugar, hot Avater, and a stand of spirit bottles. Sir Giles produced his pet meerschaum \u2014 a Zouave's head coloured to the brightness of mahogany \u2014 and busied himself chopping, with an instrument for the purpose, a square inch of cake cavendish of potent strength and acrid odour. When his pipe was lighted, he pushed the spirit stand tOAvards the Vicar and advised him to try the rum, a pure Jamaica Avhite as Hollands. He himself took brandy, and powerfully stiff did he breAv his grog. Paul poured himself out a thimbleful of the Avhite rum, and Avas obliged to confess that he had never tasted such good spirit before \u2014 an encomium Avhich pleased the baronet, Avho Avas never indifferent to praise be stowed on himself or his belongings.

There Avould have been enough in the picture to blast the Vicar's character for ever in the estimation of a parishful of old ladies, and to have set a bishop gasping with indignation. Nevertheless, in doing as he did Paul Avas practising the truest and finest kind of charity. The man op posite him Avas his enemy, who had loaded him Avith the foulest abuse and cast in his teeth the most heinous aspersions ; but all this he forgot, and considered only that his late enemy was sick and sorroAvful, and needed cheering. He played, and talked in an amicable Avay on all the topics which his host introduced ; and bided his time to hear whatever the latter might have to say afterwards. For Paul knew that he had not been sent for simply to take a hand at piquet ; he divined that Sir Giles by his sociability was paving the way for the request of some service, favour, or piece of advice Avhich he would proffer by-and-by, when he should have mustered courage enough to speak out. His presentiment Avas justified. When Sir Giles had won three games and finished his glass he was in a good humour, and threw down his cards."], [289, "A FIRESIDE CONFESSIONAL. 279 ' You're a good felloAV, Rushbrand,' said he ; ' but I won't bore you to go on playing.

Look here, Rushbrand,' and, dropping his lemon, Sir Giles fastened his red-rimmed eyes on the Vicar Avith a Avoe-begone appeal for sympathy ; ' I'm almost heartbroken, man : my engagement Avith Miss Amy Carew is at an end, and I love her so desperately that if she Avill not be reconciled to me I think it will kill me.' Very stern and cold was the look that stole over Paul's face ; but within him his heart leaped. ' Thank God,' thought he, ' that she is saved from this man.'"], [290, "280 777.47- ARTFUL VICAR. ' You can understand my feelings \u2014 you who know her,' continued the baronet, eagerly watch ing Paul's features, but misreading the expression on them. ' And now Avhat I Avant to pray of you is that you will go to Miss Amy and plead my cause for me.' ' I? I plead your cause ?' exclaimed Paul, almost starting from his chair in surprise. ' Yes, you, for none could do it better,' an swered Sir Giles, taking another gulp at his grog to embolden him. ' For this past week I have been turning over the thing as I lay toss ing on that brute of a bed. I thought of Iioav you had taken Nell Truman's cause in hand and Avon it against all apparent chances of success.' ' The precedent is one which you ought not to adduce, Sir Giles, for you have often taunted me Avith Avhat I did.' ' I may have said that you had rendered poor Hartleigh a dubious service, but I'll swear you saved Nell herself from infamy,' was the baronet's emphatic reply. ' Whither Avould she have drifted but for you ? Goodness knows ! And she may become a saint yet for all you can tell. There's no guessing Avhere Avomen stop once they turn their thoughts towards religion.' ' But Avhat kind of a service should I be ren dering Miss Carew if by chance I had poAver to persuade her to become your wife ?

' And Avhat is more, it Avould be the saving of me, for if she Avon't marry me I'm a lost man. Look at this,' and so saying he touched the brandy bottle Avith a gesture that Avas almost tragic in its blunt significance. ' That is my only friend and comforter noAV.

Such was the position of Paul Rushbrand, endeavouring to make out Avhat were the dictates of his duty toAvards God and his neighbour. Scout the man, of course ; read him a sharp lecture over his past iniquities ; assure him that it was Heaven's hand that pressed on him so sorely, and that it would be sin to stand in the way of Divine punishment. Such Avas ob viously the first prompting and the one most concordant with the self-complacency of human nature, which ever suggests the agency of a punishing hand in the ills which afflict our neighbours. Here was verily a fine occasion for triumphing over the abasement of an enemy ; but it Avas perhaps because the triumph was so easy that Paul disdained it, and asked himself Avhether this trial had not rather been sent to prove his OAvn disinterestedness and faithfulness in the service of his Master. He Avas a shrewd moralist who first said that Avhen a man hesitates in a conscientious dilemma, he has only to select the course most displeasing to him to be in the right. Paul sat down Avith his head between his hands, and pondered, listening with all his might to the jarring of the inner voices."], [295, "MENDELSSOHN'S WEDDING .MARCH. 285 The room into Avhich he had been shoAvn Avas a large three-window chamber on the first floor, adjoining the baronet's sleeping apart ment. It Avas not the study, but Sir Giles's private sanctum, where he ate, sat, read, wrote, and transacted all his business when alone. Its grand size and the multifarious uses to which it Avas adapted rendered it a capharnaum of all kinds of properties, from Avhich an observer could easily have inferred the tastes and cha racter of the owner. There was a wide, low divan Avith soft cushions for sprawling upon, and a safe like a banker's for holding valuables. Bundles of fishing implements obstructed one corner of the room, and a heap of old news papers were strewn in another. In a dozen places the carpet, which had once been red and of a thick pile, was torn into holes, shoAving the white cords ; and Tear 'em had left traces of himself on the hearthrug in the shape of greasy patches, showing Avhere he had gnawed the bones flung from his master's table.

The artist had flattered his sitter (for by means of careful posturing, favourable light, and re-touches by hand, photographers can flatter as well as painters), and yet what a coarse, ignoble phy siognomy it was ! No ray of intellectual light to brighten it \u2014 no soul gleaming on those dull, besotted features of clay ; and Paul threAv down the portraits, feeling that a longer study of them could only prejudice him the more against their original. This brought into his mind the portrait of Amy which he had purchased, \u2014 and what a different one that Avas ! There the artist had not done justice to the beauty of the model ; nevertheless, the likeness was one radiant with a soft, spell-binding charm. What could have become of this photograph ? Surely it could not have fallen into Sir Giles's hands, as Paul had apprehended, or, if it had, Sir Giles could not have guessed at the meaning of the Avords Avritten on it, else he Avould never have ven tured to ask a rival to be his mediator. Who knows, though ? The man was so gross and selfish \u2014 so unrestrained in his acts by any con sideration for the feelings of others \u2014 that one could not take the ordinary conduct of rational men as affording any precedent for the way in which he might behave."], [297, "MENDELSSOHN'S WEDDING MARCH. 287 At this point in his mental diatribe the Vicar paused, Avith an uneasy reflection Avhich all the voices in his conscience seemed to be forcing upon him. The more base Sir Giles was proved to be, so much greater the need for reclaiming him. Was it for a Christian to say that because a man was bad, and in danger of becoming worse, he must be suffered to go his way to perdition ? If so, then Avas all preach ing of repentance A-ain and the preacher's office a mockery ? Why should not Sir Giles Tap low be as amenable as other men to those influences Avhich have ahvays been knoAvn to operate beneficially on the human character ? And if under the barren surface of his heart there lay a more promising soil which the hands of a tenderly-loved Avife and children could render fruitful ; and if, failing the care of these loving hands, Avhatever there might be of good in the man must remain undeveloped, Avhere was the minister's duty ?

But so long as there is a hope of fruit or floAver, will the good gardener despair of his shrub, because it is not so fair to the sight as others ? The upshot of Paul Rushbrand's medita tions was, that he sat down to the writing-table, took a sheet of paper, and wrote Sir Giles this note : \u2014 Dear Sir, I do not think it Avould be of any ad vantage to recur to the topic which Ave have been discussing. You have asked me to render you a service, and the motives which you allege for your request are such as make it a duty on my part to comply.

Having folded this letter, Paul went doAvn-"], [299, "MENDELSSOHN'S WEDDING MARCH. 289 stairs, and gave it to a servant to deliver to his master ; then he hurried from the house. His object in taking to flight Avas to avoid another interview with Sir Giles, lest he should again become prejudiced against the baronet by the latter's insufferable language and manners. Sir Giles was one of those luckless persons who are sure to damage the best cause if they plead it for themselves. Paul resolved he Avould take counsel of Mr. Truman, and beg him, if he thought fit, to seek Amy, and lay Sir Giles's case before her. That the baronet should not be rejected Avith out having his suit pleaded in the terms best fitted to touch the heart of a generous girl was no more than justice ; but Paul could not have stooped to the hypocrisy of becoming Sir Giles's advocate in person. He would have broken doAvn in the attempt. The utmost he could undertake, loving Amy as he did, was to pray that good might come of Avhat he pro posed to do, and that he might bear the event with resignation if it pleased Heaven to soften Amy's heart towards her unworthy admirer. It Avas early in the afternoon Avhen he left Taplow Court, and the Avinter sun Avas shining brightly in the streets as he reached Stil borough.

(they were growing fat and lively) ; but as he passed the church door he Avas hailed by the charwoman, who had been cleaning out the sacred edifice, and who stood under the porch in high pattens, mop in hand, and with her dress pinned up over her brown petticoat. She had found something, she said, in sweep ing out Sir Peter Carew's pew. It was a silk neckerchief which one of the young ladies had probably left on the previous Sunday, and she had deposited it in the vestry. As the church door was open, Paul stepped in. He had begun to feel a sense of pro prietorship in the beautiful building, and was always glad of an excuse to come and dream a little in its chancel. This time he walked up to the altar-rails, gazed musingly at the Ten Commandments painted in illuminated Gothic letters over the communion table, and then knelt. All his doubts had assailed him anew as he walked up the nave which her feet trod every Sunday. He wondered how he could bear to see her coming in there week after week for year after year leaning on Sir Giles's arm ! He had often asked himself this ques tion during the time of her engagement, but it had never pricked his heart with such poignancy as now, and in the intensity of his emotion he cried aloud : ' Amy, Amy darling, how I love you ! O God, gracious Father,"], [301, "MENDELSSOHN'S WEDDING MARCH. 291 send me some token by which I may know how to act ; and if it please Thee that she may not be wholly lost to me, grant me this favour, and make me worthy of it. Nevertheless, not as I will, but as may seem best to Thy wisdom for her happiness !' He rose from his knees refreshed, but his eyes were dim, and he started, thinking he had beheld an apparition, for Amy stood close to him. The artificial light of the chancel prevented him from seeing whether she blushed or no ; but there was certainly a bashful look on her face, and her hand trembled as she offered it him. ' I have come to fetch a neckerchief Avhich I left in the pew last Sunday,' said she. ' The charwoman told me it Avas in the vestry, and I entered, thinking to find you there.' 'Have you been here long?' he faltered, more troubled than she. ' Several minutes ; for, see, I have my neckerchief,' she replied, truthfully. ' I feared to disturb you, and so Avalked noiselessly.

Then after a pause, during which her bosom heaved and her large open u 2"], [302, "292 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. eyes were fixed on his in mute inquiry, he told her what had been the subject of his prayer. It was very simply said ; but Sir Giles, had he been eaves-dropping amongst the empty pews, could not have wished for a better advocate. Never did a man paint in truer language the part which it is open for women to play in rescuing the fallen. He had no suspicion of how eloquent he Avas \u2014 of how nobly and fully he was discharging the mission which but a short while before he had estimated as beyond his powers. Amy listened Avith drooping head, and sorely agitated would she have been had not her guardian Angel led her up the chancel in time to hear her name pronounced by Paul so warmly, when he was unaware of her pre sence. As it was she Avas deeply stirred, and her tears trickled fast ; but she let him speak on, as though to convince herself more and more by his pleadings for another how magnanimous and good he was. But there was also a music in his words ; for, unconsciously to himself, every one of them breathed of his own love. When he expatiated on the influence which she might wield over her husband, his description of her glowed with all the romantic ardour of Avorship ; Avhen he hinted at the power of her sparkling eyes, sweet smile, and gentle voice, he merely conveyed the sensations of his own"], [303, "MENDELSSOHN'S WEDDING MARCH. 293 thraldom.

' Some one who loves me,' said she, looking up at him through her tears, ' and who would have served for me seven years, as facob did for Rachel! ' Amy ! ' cried Paul, as he folded her in his arms.

CONCLUSION. Not immediately did Paul and Amy make known that they were engaged. Though lovers, they were almost strangers the one to the other, and had to pass through that charm ing time when young affianced people unfold their secrets \u2014 whisper to each other how love Avas first kindled in their breasts, and speak of the future, which is to be so cloudless and golden. Amy began to come often into Stil borough under one pretence or another. She was assiduous at the meetings of charitable clubs, at Sunday schools, at children's feasts ; and her graceful figure was no more seen in the hunting field. The gradual changes that were fitting her to become a clergyman's wife Avere perceptible to others before they became so to her own family ; but at last the scales fell even from her sisters' eyes. It was remarked how quiet Amy had grown of late ; how often Mr. Rushbrand was a visitor at Royster Hall, and again how much his manners had lost of their"], [305, "CONCLUSION. 295 primitive aAvkwardness, and had improved : so that, on the whole, Mrs. Warrener and Mrs. Hunt could take credit for having ' foreseen the thing from the very first,' when one bright spring day Paul came to ask Sir Peter's consent to his betrothal. Of course Sir Peter had foreseen nothing, and Avas surprised ; and of course \u2014 more patrum \u2014 he would rather that his pet daughter had taken a husband of his own choosing ; but he was fain to own that the Vicar was one of those men whom you get to like more and more as you know them better ; wherefore, after he had consulted Amy, and received a shower of kisses by way of ansAver to his question whether she really wished to become a parson's wife, his consent was given, and a blessing along with it. Mrs. Warrener and Mrs. Hunt made believe to frown a little, and remarked that Amy could have done much better for herself ; but they were debarred from saying much on this head by the circumstance that they themselves had made love matches of a much less promising character than this one ; and as to birth, why it was notorious that Captain Hunt could not trace his descent straight from Nimrod, as he would have liked to do. Isabel Carew was the only one of the sisters who might have been qualified to talk severely about mesalliances, for by that time she Avas duly engaged to Rupert"], [306, "296 777.47\" ARTFUL VICAR. Hartleigh, the future lord of Hazelwood. Rupert had, before the close of winter, received formal notice, through Helen Hartleigh's solicitor, that her ladyship had no expectations of an heir, and he was only Avaiting for the ten legal months from the date of the late lord's death to expire before taking official possession of the title, the property, and his bride, all at the same time ; but notwithstanding this promotion, Isabel in genuously confessed that she would have ac cepted Rupert if he had been landless, coronet less, and penniless. None of the brothers had anything to say against Paul, and Oswald was right glad to have him as a brother-in-law. So the wedding was solemnised one fair April morning, and was as gay an affair as bells, bridesmaids, and a merry concourse of friends could make it. Mr. Truman spoke the bless ing, and was assisted by Mr. Fulmouth, who had come to take charge of the parish during its Vicar's honeymoon on the Continent, and who was to be royally paid for this service, as well as largely indemnified for taking his boys home again, seeing that Sir Peter Carew did not wish his son-in-laAv to continue receiving pupils. The two young Fulmouths were the only doleful spectators of the festal scene, for they had eaten more during four months under Paul's roof than in a twelvemonth at any other period of their lives, and to part with Paul signified for them"], [307, "CONCLUSION. 297 the parting with a most succulent connection.

The new peer was not proud, nor did he shoAv himself above receiving a tip similar to that which had been imparted to the Fulmouths ; but he was cock-a-Avhoop about his future prospects, for Lady Pompermore had been compelled by his guardians ('a pair of bricks,' as he described them) to let him go to Eton ; and he seemed to be under the impres sion that his life at that classical seat of learning was going to be one uninterrupted round of delights. It maybe as Avell to state that thence forth, Avhenever he came home for his holidays, Lord Pandaddie never failed to call at the vicarage to see hoAv his former tutor was getting on ; but somehow his affection for Eton did not continue increasing upon closer acquaintance.

All, or Avell-nigh all, the Vicar's parishioners Avished him joy of his beautiful bride, and"], [308, "298 7-77.47- ARTFUL VICAR. thought him a lucky fellow ; but needless to say, Sir Giles Taplow was not of this number. Though Paul had carried him with his own lips the secret of his long attachment to Amy, and of his betrothal to her \u2014 thinking it would be more manly not to let the rumour of these things reach him from other tongues \u2014 Sir Giles had burst out into profane cursing and swearing, and ever since that day had not ceased to declare to all who Avould hear him that Rushbrand was the artfullest dodger, the most double-dealing, canting trickster that ever dis graced a surplice. Unfortunately he spoke too much on this grievance to captivate any sym pathy. People seldom bestow much pity on a rich lover who is jilted for a much poorer one, it being presumable that the lady had good reasons for the choice which she made. So the baronet's bluster was smiled at, and as the CareAv connection had now grown so strong everywhere about, he soon saw that he must mend his man ners and hold his peace, or else, for his own comfort's sake, leave the neighbourhood for a while and go travelling. He adopted the latter course, and betook himself across the Atlantic for a moping tour through the States of queer drink and tall talk. But did he carry a broken heart with him ? No. Fidelity in love is an attribute of great natures only, and Sir Giles's heart was not equal to the achievement of"], [309, "CONCLUSION. 299 breaking itself for grief. He reminded one rather of a man who has been cruelly flogged than of one who has received a death-wound. His disappointment found vent in splenetic out bursts, occasionally watered by tipsy tears ; but gradually these fits of rage grew rarer, and when they had quite spent themselves they left him much as he had always been. On his return to Taplow Court he fell into his old habits, slouched about with Tear'em at his heels, smoked pipes, drank, and one by one renewed his old acquaintanceships ; till on a bright day, meeting Mr. and Mrs. Rushbrand in the street, he stopped, shook hands with them, and from that time the past seemed forgotten. Sir Giles was too sharp ever to die the death by D. T. which he had prophesied, for he had a toper's talent for keeping himself just within the boundary-drop of excess ; he was also too sharp to marry, for having been denied the ' one woman in a thousand ' whom he had found, he was not going to take his chance among the remaining nine hundred and ninety-nine, lest his second selection should give him too frequent cause to regret the first. Like Sir Giles, Helen Hartleigh quitted Stilborough before Paul Rushbrand's wedding day ; but, unlike him, she shook its dust off her boots and never returned there. She had not lived long enough at Hazelwood to make her-"], [310, "777.47\" ARTFUL VICAR. 300 self enemies among the lower order of tenants, and so left the name of a pretty lady who was uncommonly kind to the poor and free-handed with her servants ; but nobody on the estate ever again saw her or heard of her once she was gone. It was said she was travelling abroad, and intended marrying again ; others asserted that she had given up all her property to the Pope, and had entered a convent. The truth is, she was simply leading in London the quiet life of a widowed gentlewoman of means. She had a brougham for winter drives, and a ba rouche for the summer, and might have been seen almost every day in the park ; also, during the season, at concerts, flower shows, and now and then at the opera. She had plenty of agreeable friends, and thanks to her religion, her beauty, and fine dresses, was received even into some of the straitest houses of the Catholic nobility. Her life was a happy one enough, and not without usefulness, for she gave away generously to charities, and was kind to broken down artists, actors, adventurers, and other people Avhom fashionable alms-givers generally* think should be left to take care of themselves. So long as her father lived Lady Hartleigh saw him frequently, and, although they did not re side under the same roof, she took care that his creature comforts were well attended to at the pretty lodgings which she had taken for him at"], [311, "CONCLUSION. 301 Kew. When he died, the 10,000/ bequeathed him by Lord Hartleigh became hers, and she made one or two splendid donations out of it for the Catholic propaganda.

Helen Hartleigh was no better or worse than multitudes of other Avomen, who, having obtained what they struggled for, remain content therewith. The world only has harsh names for them when they fail. And so it is with the other sex when they strive after great ends, whether for themselves or for others. There can be no doubt that Mr. Joseph Pottinger, grocer, had been Avithin an ace of doing very great things for the town of Stilborough ; and had he succeeded Avho can doubt but that his statue, attired in a bronze swallow-tail, would some day have graced the principal square in the city spreading around the factories of ' Stubbs's Piece ' ? As it was, he failed, and had not the wit to bear his failure meekly \u2014 as who should say a man knocked down and picking himself up with a smile. At the expiration of his year of mayoralty, he found that his voice had no longer such a preponderat ing* weight in the ToAvn Council as of yore ; so that when, in pursuance of his annual custom, he rose to make his motion for suppressing the grant for the ToAvn Plate at the Royster Races,"], [312, "777.47\" ARTFUL VICAR. 302 he was greeted with a gust of laughter, derisive yells and cat-calls by the very men who had followed his leadership in the matter of putting up ' Stubbs's Piece ' for sale. Such are the ups and downs of the public man's career. The CareAvs lorded it now from Royster to Hazel wood, and J. Pottinger, who had gone to rash war with them, found the world wag ill with him. One election time he lost his seat in the Town Council, whereas the hated Pettigrew remained there, becoming a tower of strength in the corporation, and succeeded his old rival both in the mayoralty, which he retained several years, and in the office of churchwarden, which he held till he went to sleep with his forefathers. Moreover, hideous to relate, Mr. Pettigrew's second son \u2014 who, being a draper's brat, could have no sort of right in the grocery business \u2014 actually opened a shop in rivalry to Pottinger's, and obtained the custom of Royster and Hazel wood Halls, of the Vicarage, and of all those worthy persons who like to buy their tea and sugar in good company. This Avas the crown ing blow to Mr. Pottinger. It did not ruin him, for he retained customers enough to live at ease ; but it loAvered him in his own esteem to cater only for the lowly of this earth ; and every spring and autumn, when the time of Royster Races came round, he would flash out sentences of vindictive wrath against those heathen sports"], [313, "CONCLUSION. 303 which he had so disinterestedly essayed to abolish, and, like a new Jeremiah, prophesy fiery doom to the crowds of sight-seers who flowed through the town in increasing numbers, although now there were two meetings a year instead of one to divide their attention.

It is moreover to be feared that high bets continued to be Avagered, and that Sir Peter Carew's sons never quite gave up their fondness for making ' little books ' on these equine events. But it would be a libel on them to say that they Avere not more moderate than of yore, having profited by the hard knocks of experience ; and Oswald especially was an altered character. He soon became an M.P., for at the death of one of the county members Sir Peter Avas invited to stand in his room, by doing which he relinquished the borough seat to his son ; and just about this time it came to pass that Oswald fell victim to a matrimonial trap, and married Lady Amber mere, Avho brought him 15,000/ a year.

It is not certain that such a device would succeed in the case of all lovers, but Lady Pompermore, and OsAvald's sisters, who coalesced with her, knew their man, and Oswald was captured. He had always felt a ' kinder sorter likin',' as our Yankee cousins say, for Lady Ambermere since she had rejected him, and readily caught at the chance of proving to her that his attentions had not been mer cenary.
