Mrs. Vereker, going swiftly through the hall, began to ascend the stair case, with a wild hope of reaching her room without interruption. Once there, she might expect peace \u2014 of a kind. Leisure to think over, and dwell upon, and torture herself, with memories of the shame, the humiliation to which she had been subjected. Perhaps, too, there were forbidden thoughts, too sweet to be openly allowed, and that yet would force their way in spite of all opposition. VOL. II. 17"], [10, "THE HON. MRS. VEREKER. 2 Peace of any kind however was denied her. \" See here ! \" roared Vereker from the foot of the staircase. \"Where are you going ? I've a word to say to you, my lady, before you turn in. Come back here. D'ye hear ? \" She stopped, and for a second hesitated. Perhaps, poor soul, a sudden determination to rebel suggested itself to her, but if so, it fell dead. She came slowly downstairs again, her lovely face like death. \" Ha ! You thought better of it,\" said he with a fiendish grin. \" Come in here.\" He caught her hand with an indrawn, hissing breath, and almost flung her into the library. She staggered and seized hold of a table to steady herself. Vereker turned and deliberately locked the door. \"Now I'll have it out with you,' he said. \" I don't know what you mean,\" said she, leaning against the table and panting."], [11, "THE HON. MRS.

Damn you ! \" cried he, with a burst of fury, \" Why don't you speak ? \" \" What is there to say ? \" returned she icily. Somehow, now that his insults poured thick and fast upon her, she was conscious of a growing calm. \" There's this ! \" shouted he, drumming with brutal, drunken force upon the table against which she stood, until the table shook, and each second seemed to bring the strong, hard fist within reach of her delicate face. \" That as I have you I'll hold you !

This man of good birth, of decent education, was, partly by nature (which sometimes plays sad pranks) partly through vice and general demorali zation, so brutal, that he spoke and acted as might a costermonger.

Her white lips parted as though she would speak, but no words came. She clenched her hands, and stood staring at him as though, were power given her, she would willingly slay him with her own right hand. It was a most mournful thing to see her pure, lovely childlike face thus transfigured by passion. \" Oh ! that I were as strong as you ! \" she said in low, vehement tones. He laughed ; and turning to the table poured out and swallowed a glass of brandy. The spirit acted like fire on tow ; his drunken mood changed and grew into absolute fury. \" What ! You would defy me,\" he said, \" you \u2014 you I Why see here ! \" He caught her suddenly and bent her"], [15, "THE HON. MRS. VEREKER. 7 backwards and then forwards, shaking her violently as if to show his mastery over her slight frame, and then, with a brutal burst of rage, dashed her from him. She came heavily against a bookcase, but her senses did not desert her, and she stood erect clinging to it desperately. For a moment she thought he was going to kill her, and she grew sick and faint ; but the action seemed to have partly sobered him, and he made no further advance towards her. A slight touch of shame grew on his face. \" There, go to bed,\" he said roughly. He moved to one side, and she went slowly towards the door. As she went she staggered. \" I didn't mean to hurt you,\" he said in a dogged, angry tone. \" Here ! drink this before you go.\" He held out to her a glass of wine, and seeing she made no effort to take it, thrust it into her hand."], [16, "8 THE HON. MES. VEREKER. She held it for a moment, and then deliberately dropped it on the floor. The glass broke into a thousand fragments. She raised her head and looked him full in the face for fully a minute, very strangehy. Something in that long, in tense gaze disconcerted him. As she went out and closed the door behind her, he breathed more freely. \" She-devil ! I'll tame her yet,\" he said, between his teeth. He went back to the brandy and drank steadily until the calm pallor of the early dawn had grown into clearer daylight. Then he threw himself heavily on a lounge, and dropped into a sleep that w-as almost insensibility. He woke about ten o'clock, rang for more brandy, and after that fell asleep again. At two he roused himself and made a pretence at eatino something, but more as an excuse to o-et down more brandy than for anything else."], [17, "THE HON. MRS. VEREKER, 9 Hardly three solid morsels passed his lips. He was subject to these attacks of the demon who governed him, and for a day, or sometimes two or three, would drink continuously, nay, ravenously, until on the very borders of delirium ; once or twice, indeed, he had over-stepped those bounds. As a rule these attacks came on after a period of forced abstinence, and he had kept himself pretty steady for the ball at The Chase. For months together sometimes he would go on, drinking hard certainly, but rarely getting beyond the sottish state of stupidity that now characterised him, and then would come a time when he revolted from all effort at respectability, and would give himself up a willing prey to his tor mentor. Shortly after his pretence at luncheon, he sent for Cecil's maid, and asked where her mistress was. The girl, who had been a sufficiently long time in the house to"], [18, "10 THE HON. MRS. VEREKER. understand his moods, said promptly that her mistress had gone for a walk in the grounds, though she had just left her lying down in her own room. She was particularly attached to Cecil, and thus sought to shield her from what might prove a scene. Vereker believed her, and once more sank back on his lounge. The day wore on,- and no one called. For this Cecil was devoutly thankful. She felt that if Dorothy or St. John had come, she could not have seen them. A very agony of shame, degradation, and misery, was overwhelming her. They had been witnesses of that most disgraceful scene in the hall at The Chase ; but she felt too as though they must, through some occult means, be aware of the horrible ordeal through which she had passed on her return home. Her shoulder hurt her terribly. She had been flung with crashing force against the sharp edge of the bookcase,"], [19, "THE HON. MRS. VEREKER. 11 and all her tender flesh was bruised, and was even now beginning to grow black. She had thought of nothing else but of Vereker's conduct towards her, and her utter powerlessness to escape from him, all through her sleepless night ; but strange to say no tears had risen out of her desperate musing. She sat and brooded \u2014 dry-eyed \u2014 sure only of this, that the worst was not yet come. She knew her husband well by this time. She had certainly \u2014 may God help all such ! \u2014 sufficient cause to du so. There was mischief lurking still within him, and sooner or later it would break out. She would be the victim of it. She dreaded the approaching dinner hour with a horrible sinking of her heart that would not be subdued. With a view to rousing herself, to help her failing courage, she flung a shawl over her shoulders, and towards evening went into the open air. She walked swiftly, as if"], [20, "THE HON. MRS. VEREKER. 12 hoping exertion would brace her nerves, but after half-an-hour 's eager pursuit of mental strength, she acknowledged that she had gained nothing by this rapid walk. She had, indeed, suffered one further shock. Amongst the shrubberies she had espied a man peering at her through the laced boughs \u2014 a man with an undying rancour in his eyes. It was Black Sandy ! She could not mistake him. She knew he had been released from the prison, whither her husband as magistrate had sent him some time since, and that his depredations, as an accomplished poacher, had been as numerous as ever, in spite of his taste of jail life; she remembered that day long ago when he had insulted her \u2014 that day when St. John had been almost a stranger to her (how odd that now sounded) \u2014 and a quick sense of fear drove her back to the house. Indeed, her nerves were all unstrung. The man's face haunted her, as she took her"], [21, "THE HON. MRS. VEREKER. 13 homeward way. What was there in it ? Something beyond a common anger. There was determination, settled purpose, an un changeable patience, a waiting for some thing that was bound to come. It puzzled her, and distres.sed her in a vague way, and it was with a sense of relief she once again entered her own room. What was the man waiting for ? What had she done to him, that he should look at her so strangely ? All other thoughts, however, were presently swallowed up in the fear that her husband might put in an appearance at dinner. She did not dare send down word that she would not come, as, were he sufficiently recovered to dine in public, he would not submit to her absence, but would insist on her coming downstairs. Once before there had been unpleasantness arising out of her desire for solitude \u2014 unpleasantness of so marked a nature that she did not care to risk a repetition of it."], [22, "14 THE HON. MRS. VEREKER. Slowly the daylight died ; the gold and blue of the morning had deepened into grey, and now at the last darkness fell upon the land. It fell upon her heart, too, when her maid told her that Mr. Vereker was in the drawing-room. She rose pre cipitately when the maid said this and got herself into her gown in haste \u2014 a pretty cream-coloured dress that gave an ad ditional charm to her beauty, though she was just now too distressed in mind to think of effect of any sort \u2014 and hurried downstairs. She was a little late, but one glance at Vereker told her this fact would pass unnoticed. He managed to get into the dining-room, however, without assistance, and sat all through dinner quite quiet, save for a lurch now and again, or a call for champagne. This latter he sipped slowly, as if not caring for it, and finally asked one of the men for brandy, a glass of which he threw into the tumbler of Heidseck that stood at his"], [23, "THE HON. MRS. VEREKER. 15 elbow. Plainly, the champagne was too weak to gratify .his heated palate. He deliberately helped himself to every dish, entrees and all, but though he played with what he with difficulty placed on his plate, he ate nothing. Mrs. Vereker, at the head of the table, ate just as much. Her brain seemed on fire. What would the end of it all be ? From time to time she glanced at him, and something singularly malign in his naturally bad countenance made her fear a break-out later on. She sat almost motionless until, dessert being on the table, the men retired, and she was left alone with him. A half formed notion of calling one of them back as a sort of protection occurred to her, but whilst she puzzled over an excuse to do so, the man was gone, and the door closed. She had seen the brandy he had asked for and taken, and, though with many throes of remorse and horror, had hoped"], [24, "THE HON. MRS. VEREKER. 16 he would take more and more until he sank into insensibility. Poor soul! She had learned to hope for what happy wives would have shrunk from in anguish and despair. He was looking terribly sodden and disgusting ; his hair hung damply on his forehead, and one of his sleeve-links had not been fastened. The cuff hung wide open, so that the fat, white arm inside could be seen. This seemed to trouble him. All through dinner he had made abortive attempts to fasten it, and now when the men were gone and he and she were alone, and silence deep as death hung over the room, he began once again to fumble with the refractory link. Again it failed him, slipping through his palsied fingers with a persistency that seemed to his dull brain demoniac, and created in him a desire for conquest. \" Come here and fasten this damned"], [25, "THE HON. MRS. VEREKER. 17 thing,\" he called to his wife in a broken, indistinct voice. She understood him however. Practice had made perfect. She rose from her seat, and came up to him and let her delicate fingers undertake the task commanded. But though she could control her move ments, the soul within her would not be silenced, and the terrible shrinking, disgust and hatred that betrayed itself on her face was written there in letters of fire. Through all his drunkenness he saw it. \" It offends you to touch me, eh ? \" said he, with a wicked snarl. \" You shrink from me. You think me the very devil, eh ? I'll give truth to that thought of yours \u2014 before I die.\" Some expression in her frightened face caught his senses and struck him wrongly. \" Ah, ah ! You'd laugh at my death, wouldn't you ? 'Twould be a release, eh ? and leave you free to join your lover. Why, curse you ! \" cried he, rising from his VOL II. 18"], [26, "THE HON. MRS.

Out you go, and may the devil prosper you ! \" He flung back the shutters, and opened the broad window ; then, catching her, swung her through it on to the gravel beneath, the window-sill being only a foot or two from the ground. \" Now, damn you ! go to perdition your own way ! \" he shouted, slammed down the window again and banged the shutters, thus leaving her alone in the cold darkness of the night outside."], [27, "CHAPTER II. \" God wot, love and I be far asunder ; I am disposed bet, so may I go Unto my death to plain and make woe.\" Foe a while she was conscious only of a thrilling sense of relief. The sweet night wind blew upon her heated forehead ; she was alone. No longer could she see that bloated, malignant, sottish face ! She stood, trembling violently, and lean ing against the wall, but hardly conscious of what had really happened. Then slowly, by degrees, the truth came to her ; she had been flung out of doors by that brute within ! That brute, who was yet her husband ! She had been spoken to, addressed, treated as though she were the very scum of the earth. She \u2014 she! Not another woman, but she herself ! 18*"], [28, "THE HON. MES. VEREKER. 20 She looked down at her hands as if to convince herself, and then ran her finger lightly yet feverishly up and down her bare arm. Then, all at once, the whole enormity of the thing flashed upon her, and a wild storm of passion swept over her. It shook her frail body, and blanched her cheek, but it gave brightness to her eye. She stood up as though strong in herself, and disdaining further the support of the wall, and swore to herself that, as he had done to her, so would she do to him. He had cast her forth, he had abandoned her \u2014 she would never return. But where to go? The night in spite of its beauty was cold enough. It was eleven o'clock, and a chill wind blew from the west. Her arms, her bosom was bare, and there was no covering nearer than the house, and that she had told herself she would not re-enter.

It was a long walk there, but she gave no thought to distance, in her then wild mood, and, moving across the garden, entered the wood on her right that led by a path she knew to The Chase. As she ran eagerly onwards, looking like the wraith of some forlorn thing in her light floating gown, she remembered what St. John had said to her, and some courage came with the memory. When, or if ever, she was in trouble, she was to come to him ! He would be ready to take her part to defend her against the world. She was sure of him. She did not even wonder what the help was he would offer, she thought only of his power to help her, and a strong, eager desire for revenge on the man whom she hated, welled up in her heart. St. John would see that she was avenged ! Her nerves were quivering, her heart throbbing with a painful haste. She, who had been the most patient of mortals, now"], [30, "THE HON. MRS.

The moon came slowly from behind the banks of cloud that up to this had dimmed its glory. Weird glimpses of it fell through the overhanging branches that formed a net-work above her head. A few stars studded the heavens. The soft, sweet dew of night clung to her naked arms as she sped swiftly onwards. She was not cold now, she was conscious of nothing but an overmastering desire to reach St. John. No thought of love for him was in her heart, no tender surety of a love returned. It was only safety she seemed to be seeking, and a way out of her"], [31, "THE HON. MRS. VEKEKER. 23 troubles, that had grown greater than she could bear. The strong deep bracken, with its odour of earth and of all things green, made a soft rustling as she passed through it ; once a dark thing sprang up beneath her feet, and fled like a spirit away. It was a timid brown creature, a hare, yet for the moment it startled her. The music of a stream \u2014 that one sleepless thing \u2014 came to her through all the drowsy noises of the night, falling with a sense of rest upon her brain. The wind had altogether died away. A wonderful stillness reigned. \" Hard overhead the half-lit crescent swims, The tender-coloured night draws hardly breath. The night is listening.\" Her steps began to grow a little slower, it suddenly appeared to her that she had come a long, long way, and with the sense of growing fatigue came a sharp terrible thought.

She felt as though she could not live out the night without speaking to him. And if, if so cruel a thing should happen as that this walk of hers should be in vain, what was she to do ? Go back again ! All through this awful slumbering silence \u2014 alone \u2014 worn out in soul and body ! A sensation of faintness crept over her as she dwelt on it. No, she could not go back. Fate could not so entirely have abandoned her. She felt that she was trembling, and growing icy cold ; and so great was her relief when, on turning a corner, she suddenly, through the terrible darkness, saw lights shining in the library windows of The Chase \u2014 the room where he always sat at night \u2014 that for a moment her nerve gave way and she sank shivering upon the \\runk of a fallen tree close by.

Lady Bessy and all the other guests had left that morning, so that he was in a measure entirely alone. Lady Bessy with Lady Eustace Fenmore, had run up to town for a day or two, escorted by Blair and one or two other of the men ; the rest had passed themselves on to various other country houses. St. John had been rather glad of their going. It gave him liberty to dwell on the one consuming thought of his life, on Cecil Vereker.

With all the tender folly of a lover he had drawn a little dainty satin-lined chair close to his own favourite lounge, and had pictured her to himself as sitting in it, gazing silently, happily, at the glowing logs, hand in hand with him, perhaps, too much at peace, at touch with each other, to care for conversation. He grew almost to think she was really in that pretty chair ; dressed all in white as he loved to see her : His wife ! Perhaps the mother of his children. A log had fallen with a crash into the fire.

She held out one hand to him appealingly, with a little piti able expression in her eyes. He knelt down beside her, and took the hand and chafed it between his own. \" You are frozen ! May God forgive him,\" he said brokenly. \" Go on ; tell me what has happened.\" She told him, as briefly as she could. She did not cry ; she seemed to herself to speak almost callously. But she for got how her face spoke for her. Misery was imprinted upon it. \" So I came to you,\" she said.

Ever since she had reached her goal, a change had come over her. The wild excitement had died \u2014 and only a certainty of the hopelessness of her position had stayed with her.

In a sort of dumb fashion he tried to rea lise that this temptation had come to him through her, who had no knowledge of what she was doing, and that therefore doubly it should be resisted ; but his heart cried out for her and would not be silenced. Surely there was a way ! He could lift her out of all her troubles. And she would go with him. He did not for a moment doubt that.

Even as she did so, St. John came upon the scene, seized Vereker and hurled him back wards ; but for this intervention it might perhaps have gone badly with Dorothy, for Vereker once roused was a savage beast, and would have thought as little of striking her as if she was a dog ; but she evidently did not think so.

Dorothy relented, smiled sweetly, and sent him off a happy man, for that evening at least. Soon afterwards, they all rose and bade Miss Jemima farewell. They were indeed very grateful to her. She had given them a most enjoyable evening. She received Colonel Scott's adieux with a frozen air. \" Oh ! I really think you should forgive him noAv,\" said Mrs. Vereker, with a little smile, who was standing next her. Her carriage had been the first to be announced, and she was hurrying away. \" I'm sure he looks dreadfully penitent ! \" She made a pretty moue at the Colonel ov-er Miss Jemima's shoulder, which he caught and returned, perhaps not so prettily.

It was as though a sculptor had conceived and begun an exquisite design ; that when half finished was overthrown, and left by the wayside defiled by dust and rain. Miss Jemima, who regarded her with distinct favour, nodded her head somewhat grimly, and then extended her hand once again to the Colonel. \" You must reform, Samuel, you must reform,\" she said, still nodding the amazing cap ; and Colonel Scott, not knowing how to reform, being innocent of offence,"], [86, "78 THE HON.

A hot sun, so brilliant as to be a base deceiver, a usurper of June's rights, was flooding the drawing-room at Vereker Court. It put to shame the fire that burned gaily in the grate. Upon one of the tables a mass of autumn flowers lay scattered. Mrs. Vereker had ordered them to be sent in here to her, and now stood over them arranging them in their several glasses.

Ever since that last abominable dis play of his temper in the library, Vereker, as I have said, had been specially careful to keep out of his wife's wayr, and for the past two or three days had been positively civil. This change puzzled her perhaps, but it also rested her, and gave her tired heart a season of repose, long unknown to it. Yet still when she heard his step in the hall, and his touch upon the handle of the door, the old startled look sprang into her face, and her hands grew cold. She could not conquer the feeling of repugnance and disgust that filled her whenever he drew near. She was afraid of him too, and perhaps this was the one thing she found it hardest to forgive him ; she, who, until she married, had known no fear of living creature, who"], [91, "THE HON. MRS.

She paled a little beneath the glance he shot at her from under his reddened lids, but she showed no further sign of cowardice. \" It would look like malice my doing it,\" he said.

She raised her left hand then, and pressed it against that side of her brow from which the dull intolerable throbbing anguish seemed to be coming.

Men call this vanity ; but who shall say it is not an honest virtue ? The expression on her face was beginning to change, as a fuller consciousness grew on her.

She gained it unseen by any of the domestics, and standing on the hearthrug, acknowledged that fact by a sigh of relief. St. John followed slowly. His blood was boiling, and there was a feeling of such devilish hatred in his heart as seemed to numb him. He felt all at once as if the knowledge of good and evil had failed him, as if he knew only the evil, and as if that were the only real good. A longing to destroy was full upon him.

What dreadful thing had happened to her, his gentle darling, that she should have come to this ? He stooped over her, and raised her forcibly from the position that had now become intolerable to him. She struggled slightly, and pushed him impatiently away. \" It is all dream-work ; do not dwell on it,\" he said, with actual entreaty. \" It is not. I am awake.

She called upon Jane, the other maid, and telling her to catch one handle of the clothes-basket, she herself laid hold of the other, and together mistress and maid started for the orchard. This charming spot lay just behind the Cottage and was seldom visited by the elder Miss Aylmer. Here then Dorothy elected to bring \" her washing,\" as she now felt a certain alloyed joy in calling it, in an almost certain hope that she would be able to struggle with it unseen by human eye. Yesterday's fine weather had not deserted to-day, and a hot sun shone down from a blue and pearly sky.

Good gracious ! was there no other end to it ? It seemed as though it would reach from that to the village. How could she fold such a thing as that ? How did Matilda do it? It suddenly occurred to her that Matilda's mother was a very troublesome old woman, and that she was positively certain she wasn't half as ill as she said she was. Well, if she was to die over this task, that was all about it, butit did seem a poor thing to be slain by a sheet. She hoped they wouldn't put it on her tombstone.

St. John made a step forward, and at the same instant so did Mrs. Vereker. She got between the two men and raised her hand as if to warn her husband back.

He was pale and rigid with the effort to subdue himself. He knew if he once let himself go nothing could come of it but scandal, in which her name would infallibly be mixed up, and that was to be avoided at all risks. There was, too, the knowledge that a struggle between him and Vereker would be an unfair one.

It was pleasant enough lying there, he thought, on the soft grass, with his heavy limbs at rest, and his dull, burning head close to the cool earth.

He knew how the law would look at it, how the injured husband would stand out white and blameless. Oddly enough, it never for one moment occurred to him that his wife would leave him, and gladly accept St. John's protection.

He removed his fixed stare from the man's face, and transferred it to the man's knife. It was long ; it was sharp ; it was as bright as silver. It seemed to hold him as by some subtle charm, but at last he tore himself from the contemplation of it, and lifted his gaze blankly to the savage face above him, that every moment seemed to come nearer and nearer.

Francis was some what behind, but I could see he was talking still, jibing in a way he had, but I fancied Hilary did not care. He showed no sign of anger that I could discern. Then they turned the corner ; almost as they turned I saw Hilary lift his head, stop short, and say something to Francis. His manner was vehement, fierce I think it was.

She seemed confused rather than distressed, but beyond this betrayed no emotion whatsoever. It was a little shock to him to see that she was not in mourning, and he could not help noticing that she looked shockingly ill. He could not help feeling, too, that his presence there was undesired by her. \" Perhaps I have come too soon,\" he said, gravely. \" But I was anxious to see for myself how you were, and besides there was something I wished to say7 to you.\" He paused, but she said nothing that might lead him to hope he was mistaken in his first suggestion. \" You are not looking well,\" he said, gently. \" No ? That is hardly to be wondered at. I have suffered,'' said she. \" It has been a terrible time. I need hardly say how I \u2014 how we all at The Chase have felt for you.\" Her own tone was so cold, so unfriendly, that he felt it im possible not to copy it in part. \" It has"], [228, "THE HON.

She made an effort as if to say some thing conventional, correct, but after a vague murmur that did not reach him, gave up the attempt. A quick flush born of deep distress dyed her white face for a moment, and at last she burst out. \" Do not mistake me. I have not grieved for him. I feel no sorrow of that sort. I feel no grief; none. I must be made of stone, I think. Surely it was a death to make any woman weep, but my tears have refused to come. I know nothing, only a sense of horror !

Just at the moment he knew he could not have spoken. So she had made all her plans, and was leaving \u2014 deliberately \u2014 and without one thought of bidding him farewell. He had had no part in her arrangements. She had treated him as though he were the veriest stranger.

I tell you it has been a century to me. I could not live if I stayed here longer. I feel as if to breathe is difficult.\" She rose as she spoke and pressed her hand against her bosom. Something of the unnatural calm that had possessed her since his entrance, melted away7. She looked all at once like the old Cecil, the woman he adored. He, too, rose. A passion of reproach and pain dimmed his eyes. \"You would have gone without seeing me,\" he said. \" You would have left me, without a word ! What has happened that vou should treat me so ?

She loved him still! That terrible coldness with which she had met him was a thing of naught, a mere outcome of a sharp attack of horror and remorse ; a remorse naturally exaggerated at such a time as this. Fresh courage filled his breast. He took a step forward, and caught her hand in his. \" Who is going abroad with you ? \" he asked. \" Dorothy.\" \" You could not find any better com panion.

A sob broke her voice, and he could see the tears stealing through her fingers. Her slender frame trembled with the agitation that overfilled it. \" Do not say that, Cecil,\" said he un steadily. He did not attempt to go nearer to her, or try in any way to check her grief. He walked over to the window, and stood there for a little while, gazing out on, but not seeing, the cold, dull autumn land scape. Presently he went back to her. \" Grant me one favour,\" he said. \" You are going away for a long time, I imagine. Before we part make me a promise.\" \" What promise ? \" asked she, nervously. \" A simple one,\" said he, with a sigh. \" Not to think of me, if possible, and I"], [233, "THE HON. MRS.

Oh, if I could! And you?\" She spoke with a sudden sharpness, and turned her gaze upon him, as though eager to read his answer in his eyes. He gave her none, however. Hoav could he tell her that he, too, would try to forget, when he knew that every beat of his heart Avould be for her, and her alone, until they two should meet again ? And how tell her that, either? To speak a single word bordering upon love, or lovers' vows, would, he felt, be a desecration of this hour, in which her mind was filled with memories, however bitter, of that dead man who had VOL.

At all events, she refrained from further question.

She seemed quite unstrung now, and moved a chair out of her way- with the jerkj7 manner of one preparing for an effort almost beyond her. \" When y-ou came, y7ou said there was something 37ou wanted to .say to me.

Because I believed you might teach yourself to think hard things of me.\" \" Hard things ! Oh! if you only knew,\" cried she. All her coolness forsook her. The deepest self-reproach betrayed itself on her face. \" Perhaps I shall never see you again,\" she went on hurriedly7. \" Indeed, when I tell y7ou what I now must, I feel you will never want to see me again.
