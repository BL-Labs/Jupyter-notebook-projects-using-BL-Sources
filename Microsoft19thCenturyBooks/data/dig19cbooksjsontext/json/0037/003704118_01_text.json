There is little passage through it ; it has no castle or even border tower ; no independent eccle siastical existence, and its surface is generally flat and uninteresting ; yet even here, in its proprietors, its occupiers, its humble church, and the banks of its stream, something to interest may be found. Its spelling varies much, as \" Hulcham,\" \" Ulle cham,\" \" Ulwcham,\" \" Elchamp,\" \" Ougham,\" and \"Ulgham\" \u2014 the latter certainly from the thirteenth century ; but it is always called \" Uff ham,\" and I have no doubt it is in the word as pronounced we must seek for its derivation.

Adopting Uffham as the true name of the place, we have no difficulty in ascribing its name to the fair-haired race, who were so trouble some to the Britons when the Romans retired. In Anglo-Saxon, \" us\" is an owl, and \" ham \" a home, a village. At the present time the to-whit-to-whoo of the bird, \" most musical, most melancholy,\" is constantly heard there in the stillness of the night, and would be more frequently when the banks of the stream were wooded. \" Uff\" is a very com mon prefix to the names of places, especially in those parts of the kingdom where the Saxons were settled. We have the same name for \" Hoolett Hall \" on the Angerton estate. The entire chapelry of Ulgham, comprising 3445 acres, constituted the manor of that name, which was in the barony of Morpeth Castle ; and there are few manors in England, of which the descent can be so clearly traced for so long a period in one uninterrupted line. William de Marlay appears in the roll of Battle Abbey ; and we are told that he came from the sunny plains of Normandy, as a sergeant to Geoffrey,"], [15, "Ulgham : its Story. 3 Placita dt qttorantOt, 1293, Dngdalt Bishop of Constance. The Conqueror rewarded his follower by a grant of the barony of Morpeth, Ulgham being one of its members. From him it passed through the Greystocks and Dacres to Belted Will Howard, whose direct descendant, the Earl of Carlisle, now Lord -Lieutenant of Ireland, is the present lord. With the Normans the passion for the chase was almost as great as the passion for war. In the grants of our early Norman sovereigns we find that they frequently reserved to themselves the right of hunting over the lands which they gave to their dependants, which must have been the case with Ulgham, as Henry I. granted free chase in the manor of Ulgham to Ranulph, son of William de Marlay. In the early part of the fourteenth century, one part of the soil of the manor passed into the hands of the monks of Newminster, another was granted to the Knights of the Hospital of St. John, at Chibburn, the largest share being retained by the lord ; and to this day no farther division has taken place.

A copy of the roll of one of the courts is followed by extracts from the orders, presentments, and actions at others from 1 619 to 1653. The court in 1623 was held by Sir Edward Grey, who was then high constable of Morpeth Castle. He was the third son of Sir Ralph Grey of Chillingham, was high sheriff of Northumberland in 1597, and died at Morpeth Castle about 1630, having entailed Howick and other estates upon his male descendants, one of whom now enjoys it. His elder brother Henry Grey lived at Newminster Abbey, where he died in 1597,' and was buried in the chancel of Morpeth Church. In 1632 Thomas Widdrington was steward, and in 1643 Henry Widdrington.

In 1 138, Ranulph de Mar lay, being on a visit to Fountain's Abbey, the first house of the Cistertians in England, was so much struck with the manner of life that the brethren led, that he built the Abbey of Newminster, which he not only endowed with surrounding lands, but in the words of his grant \u2014 \" At Ulacaen I have given them to build their granges upon, from the Eagle's nest to the Well of Erard ; and as the stream of that well runs into the Lima, and as the Lima runs as far as the march of Forum.\" \" The Grange\" was really the farm of the monas tery, which they cultivated not only to supply the house with corn and cattle, but for profit. The farms were worked by lay brethren, who in busy seasons performed their religious services in the fields, that there might be no cessation of labour. The abbot of the house occasionally resided at the granges. Newminster had its home-farm or grange close to its walls, besides which it had others at Ulgham, Ritton, Nunnykirk, Stritton or Sturton, near Warkworth, Horton and Newton in Bywell.

Standing on a spur of land, it is drained and watered by the elder- fringed stream from the Well of Erard on the west ; it faces the south, and slopes down to the Lyne, and the gently undulating land from thence to the east is bounded by that stream to a little below the Cat crag. This is the most fertile of the land included in the grant ; and the high and wide ridges of the Old field are very probably unbroken, and in the same form as when they were cultivated by the monks.

This was confirmed to them by John second Lord Greystock, when he was at Uigham in 1297. The Grange contains 703 acres, and at the time of the Dissolution was worth \u00a313:6:8; its rental is now \u00a3807, forcibly shewing the value of agricul tural improvements. A branch of the numerous family of Fenwicks were living here in the beginning of the seventeenth century, and left it about ten years ago only ; they were descended from Robert Fenwick of Bedlington, who represented the county in the parliament of the Commonwealth.

In 161 9 it belonged to John Kay and John Bulman, from whom it passed to Robert Lawson, who in 1 67 1 conveyed to the Earl of. Carlisle land in White ridge Bush, Wester Seavens, and North Wood. The re mainder descended to Lawson Armstrong, of Glou cester Hill, near Warkworth ; he was the captain of a merchant ship, married Jane Smith of Togstone, and the latter years of his life lived at Ulgham, where he died in 1 802, at the age of eighty-two. He devised the land to his nephew Robert Swallow, who sold it in 1838 to the Earl of Carlisle. The village of Ulgham, on the south side of the Lyne, is a long narrow street, and a few years ago consisted principally of cottages, most of them of a very rude type ; the roofs were thatched, the tim bers rested on the ground, and the low walls were of mud and rubble stone. At the lower end the water stood in pools ; this state of things produced its natural consequence ; and but too often low fever commenced at one end of the village and crept from house to house to the other.

Although the general surface of the chapelry is flat and looks very naked since it was so much denuded of wood, yet the narrow and woody banks of the Lyne present pretty bits of scenery, as will be found by any one who will wander from the village by the mill pool, and follow the sinuous banks of the winding and sparkling burn fringed with hazel, allers, and ash, by the narrow green pas ture, bounded by the little mill stream, to the rude mill with its overshot wheel, and pass it to the plank below, where he will think of Tennyson's verses : \u2014 \" Or from the bridge I lean'd to hear The milldam rushing down with noise, And see the minnows eveiywhere, In crystal eddies glance and poise, The tall flag-flowers, where they sprung Below the range of stepping stones, And those three chesnuts near, that hung In masses thick with milky cones.\" Of \"the rude forefathers of the hamlet\" we know"], [40, "28 Ulgham : its Story. tVallis.

History has preserved the name of one person con nected with the place, and that in a very slight and incidental notice connected with a somewhat roman tic incident in the history of one of the lords. In 1 38 1 Ralph Lord Greystock was warden of the marches, and on the 5th June in that year was taken prisoner in a border skirmish at Horseridge in Glendale by the lord of Dunbar. His brother William generously became hostage for him, was imprisoned in the castle of Dunbar, and died of a fever which was then prevalent there. He was buried at that place, but two years after his body was taken up and interred before the high altar of Newminster, next to that of Margery Lady of Ulg ham. From the place of her burial the Lady Mar gery must have been a person of some distinction, and probably related to the founder of the abbey, one of whose descendants was laid by her side. We have notice about the same time of another inhabi tant, but he was of the race of Gurth.

A family of the Rennolds were for some time the agents of the lords and the occupiers of the manor house ; but according to tradition, when Ulgham was visited by plague in the middle of the seventeenth century, they fled to Stobswood, to which the infection was brought by a favourite dog, and the whole family became victims to the disease. At that time Thornthwaite was a favourite hunting seat of Lord William Howard, and he sent Peter Wilson of the Rawfoot in Toathman, Westmorland, to take charge of his Northumberland estates and to reside at Ulgham. Wilson's descendants continued to live there until about twenty years since, when Thomas Wilson left it. The family acquired estates at Duddo, Tritlington, Hepscott, and Morpeth. Those at Tritlington and Morpeth were sold some time since, and those at Duddo and Hepscott by Richard Wilson of Lincolns Inn Fields about 1832.

The villagers had all been born there ; there was then no little shopkeeper \" licensed to sell tea and tobacco ; \" there was no \" dressmaker from Morpeth ; \" but there was the smith at the western end of the village beneath that grand ash tree, of which there are few examples in the north. \" Under a spreading ashen tree The village smithy stands ; The smith, a mighty man is he, With large and sinewy hands ; And the muscles of his brawny arms Are strong as iron bands.

There was almost a patriarchal simpli city among the people, who were connected with each other either by relationship or by association. The labouring people respected their betters, who returned it with kindness and esteem. Yule tide was not forgotten amongst them, and on St. John's day, the feast of the dedication of their church, was the great village festival of the year, not as of late years, distinguished by two or three gingerbread stalls, and a few drunken men reeling about.

The good old souls, like Joan Dart ford, who said, when accused of heresy, that \"she had only learnt the Creed and Ten Commandments, and never durst meddle with the profound mysteries of religion,\" never meddled with unnecessary dispu tations, but came to worship, as good men used to do, and if the world went hard with them, as it oft- D"], [46, "Ulgham : i/s Story. 34 Ecclesiastical History times did, they found their comfort in the sanctuary. Not given to divisions or differences were such people. In those days letters were received at the village as chance gave opportunity, seldom except on the market day at Morpeth. The weekly Newcastle paper was the only channel by which distant events were learnt. The amusements sought for beyond the village were a bull-bait or a county ball at Mor peth. For the latter, ladies went early to the town, that the hair-dresser might apply his art in turns, and many sat with cushions beneath their hair, which was stiffened with powder and pomatum, from early morning until evening, when the ball was opened with a country dance, followed by minuets, and closed by Sir Roger de Coverlcy.

The stone is so small that it is useless to attempt to trace the zigzag figure which generally distinguishes such stones. If this conjecture is correct, this stone is a relict of a period anterior to the introduction of Christianity, and may be likened to the fragment of a bone of an extinct animal.
