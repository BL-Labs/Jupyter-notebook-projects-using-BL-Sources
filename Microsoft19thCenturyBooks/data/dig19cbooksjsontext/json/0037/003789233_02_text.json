From the day that Eobert met Berkeley at Mr. Steinheim's there was a certain change in the manner in which lie was addressed by Adrienne. She had considered him talented, and, as far as she could tell, high principled ; but although always courteous and amiable \u2014 she had never gone beyond the manner of a rather proud woman to the dependent of her father ; nor"], [65, "59 A KISING MAN. was it likely she should. She had first seen him almost entreating charity, faint with hunger, trembling lest the last hope that kept him from positive beggary should be denied him. After that, he performed his duties rigidly, but never endeavoured to ingratiate himself with the family \u2014 he was taciturn and ungracious ; the truth was, Steinheim, who did not discover in a day the valuable qualities of his amanuensis, was naturally haughty and violent to his inferiors \u2014 though bland and courteous when in a good temper, he took no trouble to disguise his ill-humour when any thin % crossed him. Eobert, with his unhappy disposition, was the most stiff-necked of dependents ; where his feelings were disregarded he grew moody aud silent ; it was only the remembrance of the great obligation he was under to Steinheim that enabled him to bear humiliation without resenting it openly and at once. When Adrienne left London she thought him con-"], [66, "60 THE CAREER OF scientious, but excessively arrogant. When she saw him again, all was changed. Stein heim petted and praised him ; wdien Eobert found that he was held in consideration he was anxious and willing to serve him, bore his ill humour silently, or ventured respectfully to oppose him. Still it was only when alone with the family that he seemed at ease. Until he had met with Berkeley, the presence of strangers constrained and oppressed him ; that feeling so galling that he was looked upon as an inferior, that if he spoke, it might be deemed presumption, and if he remained silent, he might be considered sullen, did not wear off until Berkeley's friendship taught him what the bitter schooling he had had so lately had made him doubt\u2014 that he had some other right to esteem, beyond wealth and station. Adrienne, before she would con ess to herself that she was interested in him, persuaded Mrs. Steinheim to pay more attention to his sister; occasionally Eobert permitted her to spend a quiet morning"], [67, "61 A RISING MAN. with them, or to accompany them to a concert ; and then she could understand the influence he held over Berkeley, and the consideration that her father professed for him. He could be, when he pleased, a delightful companion ; with Berkeley and Alice he was cheerful, and if his remarks were seldom witty, they were always piquant and just. He was one of those men, that even in prosperity are cold, distant, and repellant to strangers ; but easy, gentle, and affectionate with the few friends they drew round them. It was very possible, knowing him but slightly, to dislike him ; but it was impossible to know him well, and not love him. Adrienne, when once the magic circle was passed, was the more drawn to him for even his sterner qualities. Mrs. Steinheim was good, because she was naturally virtuous. Lionel Steinheim's principles were mere affairs of convenience \u2014 there was no stability \u2014 no foundation even in his best feelings ; but there was with Eobert that unflinching and decided"], [68, "62 THE CAEEER OF character that a woman can so love \u2014 that firm ness that is such security to affection \u2014 that certainty that there will be no littleness \u2014 no meanness, that is the greatest destroyer of love. Even in his faults there could be no abase ment \u2014 he had tbat certain loftiness of mind, possessing which a man may sometimes be a great criminal, never a little villain. Alice was with Adrienne one morning, Berkeley always contrived to call on these occasions, and generally made his visits unreasonably long. Frederick Trevanion, who had arrived in town, saw his cab at the door, and went in ; a little time after Beaumanoir entered to ask some question of Miss Steinheim. He knew Trevanion slightly ; for he had often made one of Steinheim's dinner parties, and he loitered in the room, interested in their conversation. \" I was speaking of a little incident that happened to me this morning,\" said Adrienne, addressing him. \" I met with a poor boy who interested me strongly.

One of the first persons he saw when he went out was Miss Steinheim ; she had written to him to bring him some of his compositions, which she tried through, correcting errors and improving beauties, and promising to get them introduced. Lionel Steinhem was in the room when Wilhelm, who thought himself a still greater poet than musician, produced some verses in honor of Adrienne, and saying where and how they had been composed, read them to her. \" I could not finish them,\" said Leinder who always spoke in German to the Stein heims. \" For there were several people in"], [197, "191 A RISING MAN. the next room talking so loud that I was quite unable to think ideas worthy of the Fraulein.\" It was true, Eobert, who was too apt to overlook those beneath him, suffered Wilhelm to remain in his room, even if people were with Mr. Herbert \u2014 imagining the German, if he overheard, could not understand, or rather not giving him a thought at all. But Wilhelm understood English much better than he spoke ; if Eobert entered he found him deeply engrossed with his occupation, when he left, Wilhelm tried to hear all that he could. \" They were disputing, and talked so loud, that I was obliged to come away without finish ing it.

The boy left the room with a heavier purse, and a heavier conscience. Steinheim was hardly satisfied with his success.

A crowd gathered instantly ; there was abuse, recrimination, won der, alarm. At last the press gave way, and two men, bearing the woman in their arms, carried her quite senseless into a chemist's close by. After a few moments one of them rushed out to fetch a doctor.

She was conscious, but in great pain, and about her distorted face hung the dishevelled curls and the soiled plume, and on her cheeks, haggard and fallen, stuck the horrid rouge.

Her wild eyes met his, she did not shriek or faint, but she looked to him with fearful earnestness. So again met the wreck of the gentleman and his miserable wife.
