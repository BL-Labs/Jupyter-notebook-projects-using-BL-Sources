In that relation my desire has been to create aorne sympathy for the slaves of under-paying tradesmen, that may ultimately give birth to some practical measures for their alleviation.

CHAPTER I. Gbsti\u00e6 Reader : If you have a short time to spare from your dally business, I pray thee, in thine, imagination, follow me. Iu the neighbourhood of tho Angel at Islington you will discover some newly-erected houses of respectable appearance. Some of these are inhabited by small tradesmen who ha-re their places of business in the city, or as close to its boundaries as possible ; whilst some other- are let out as furnished lodgings to clerks, the chief of whom belong to the law. It is a cold morning in the early part of December, and as you alight from the omnibus at the aforesaid inu, you discover tho pavement to be greasy and slippy in consequence of the fog. The pie- shops opposite \u2014 that are continually selling kidney pies by hundreds, making you wonder from whence all the kidneys came to supply the demands of the Isliugtonians with that choice article of diet \u2014 are lighted with gas. The linen-draper's young men are busily engaged doing something behind the counter with the gas half turned up, but not a single customer is there in the shop, and the men look dreadfully blue as they go on winding lace round the thiu pieces of wood used for such purposes ; whilst the green -grocer's shop strikes an ague into your bones as you shuffle past its damp cabbages, always endeavouring at the same time to keep from coming in contact with them. The sprats and other fish which are lying on the costermonger's barrow look dull and limp, and the \" penny a lumps\" seem such enormous pennyworths, that your suspicions, as regards their purity, are at once aroused, aud you feel half inclined to express your private opinion upon the subject to the little thin woman, with a child in one hand aud a plate in another, who is about to purchase one of the aforesaid lumps ; and which, poor soul, is all that she will get for dinner ; and a good one loo, so she thinks, to what she had yesterday. You and I, dear reader, would have said it had been no dinner at all- Having at length reached . certain street, the mortar of which seems scarcely dry between the bricks, we turn from the main road down towards the New River, and opposite a small church t_s new as the street, we halt. Placing our"], [18, "6 AUNT ELIZA'S GARRET. hand upon the knocker, round which has been fixed \u2022 thick bandage to deaden its sound, we make a sufficient noise to allow of our being admitted at once into the residence of Mr. Pratt. We arc shown into a parlour, neatly furnished, but which, nevertheless, has somewhat of the counting house appearance. On the table, a long one, which fre quently fulfils the duties of a counter, are lying various pieces of silks and satins, embroidered in every conceivable pattern. Some of these pieces are destined for waistcoats, some for bonnets, others for ladies' dresses. There are folding doors which open and allow you to pass from the front to the back parlour. Here you discover a youth, about fifteen, busily engaged with pieces of tin, bent into all manner of shapes, marking the patterns on the \" raw material\" ready for the needle hands to work up into the finished article. There is, however, a great silence throughout the house, and the marking boy goes carefully on with his work for fear he should create (he least noise. We now pass through the side door and proceed up stairs, and in the front room on the first floor we find Mr. Pratt. Yes, there he is, lying on yonder bed ; and that little woman, with such beautiful dark hair, and dark eyes, and cheeks pale as death, occasioned by too much watching at her husband's sick bed, is Mrs. Piatt. The youth down stairs calls her, however, Aunt Eliza ; and the young girl who now enters the room, and appears about a couple of years the elder of the youth, and who is bearing in her hands a bottle of medicine, carefully and artistically done up iu nice while paper, bearing the direction \" Mr. Pratt,\" and having affixed to its neck another long slip of paper, resembling the neck-band of a clergyman, on which are written the very remark able words, \" the mixture as before,\" \u2014 calls her Aunt Eliza likewise ; whilst the little baby iu yonder cot merely smiles and coos in her face, and like most babies of such tender years says nothing. Mr. Pratt at length opens his eyes, and his wife asks in an under-tone, \" if he feels better.\" No,\" returned Pratt, in a pettish tone. \" Can I do anything for you, drnr '.'\" continued Mrs. Pratt, trying to smooth his pillow for him. \" You had better take your medicine now, it is near the time.\" \" It does me no good,\" returned Pratt ; \" the man only sends it in because he wants to make a bill, but lie wont get it I know.\" \" You mistake his kindness, you do indeed,\" returned his wife, pour ing the medicine into a wineglass; \"he perfectly understands our circumstances.\" \" Well, well, give it me,' exclaimed Praft, hastily, \" I'm too ill to argue with you now. I suppose he has some object in view, some"], [19, "7 AUNT ELIZAS GARRET. motive, no one acts without it. There, now let me be ;\" and having swallowed the medicine, he turned over on his side and commenced groaning. He did not, however, remain long in that position, but raising himself in the bed, he exclaimed, pressing his hands to his sides as if Ms pains were there : \u2014 \"My God! what shall I do? Send for the surgeon \u2014 rm dying ! I feel I am. Oh, God ! don't let me die t My poor wife, what can she do ? I'm a bankrupt, and have not a penny to leave her. Oh, God ! my chest. Is the doctor coming ? I can't keep in bed, I shall die if I do. Have you given me the right medicine ! Oh, God ! do not let me die.\" Saying which he sank upoa the floor in a convulsive fit. In a few moments the surgeon entered, aud used his skill to bring the patient round. It was of no avail, death had already affixed his brand mark ; and Pratt, after having remained quiet and insensible for nearly an hour, was again convulsed in every limb ; during one of those awful throes peculiar to convulsions, he half raised himself from the bed on to which he had been listed, and uttering a deep groan, he fdl back upon the pillow an inanimate lump of flesh. CHAPTER II. In due time Mr. Pratt was buried. What hard work it had been to his wife to give her dear husband a decent funeral ! Left without a single farthing of ready money, and no friends of whom she could borrow the required amount, there was no other source open to her bat to sell her piano and a part of her furniture, to raise the sum necessary to pay the undertaker's bill, who, of course, required the money down before he brought the coffin in, and to purchase mourning clothing for herself, her child, and the boy and girl we epoke of in the foregoing chapter. It was the evening of the day on which the body of Pratt had been taken to its last home. The tain was descending heavily, and the wind, fierce and cold, drove it against the window panes, making that peculiar pattering noise which Induces those who are seated before a bright fire to take the poker in their hands to stir the blazing coal, and to draw their chair nearer to its congenial warmth. Mrs. Pratt was sitting with her baby in her arms, her feet upon the fender, her bright eye staring vacantly into the fire burning in the kitchen grate. The marking youth was sitting opposite to her, nurBing his knee, and the young girl was sitting between them, her right hand rubbiDg the back of her left. The fire burned brightly, and winked,"], [20, "ABNT E!IZ*'\u00bb CARRET. 8 and spluttered, and snapped, and threw out little jets of gas, that pre sently burned and blazed away in right good earnest. \" Dear me, how it rains,\" exclaimed George, for that was the christian. name of the youth. \" Yes, rains,\" returned Mrs. Pratt, or rather soliloquised, tt aad how long we may have shelter and a fire to warm and comfort us, God knows, I don't. 1 wish I was dead, and this poor baby too, and lying In the damp cliurch-yard ; I should not then have to battle wi : \u25a0 world, without a single soul to hdp me. My prospect U as e! as the weather.\" For a time there was a pause. George still sat, nursing his knee most energetically, and his sister by his side rubbed her hands as slowly __> tver. During this pause we will explain mcce fully to our readers who the Pratts are. Joseph Pratt, just now deceased, had been a clerk iu the city, anc( having been a steady young man had succeeded, in Easing a little i Upon the death of his employer, he determined to commence upon his own account. He was getting on admirably when he was called to his brother's bed-side, who, dying somewhat suddenly, begged of bis brother Joseph to take care of his children, a boy and a girl, respectively named George and Amelia. This, Joseph promised to do, and he kept his word. His wife readily and willingly welcomed the two young orphans, putting them to such work as they were best able of doing. Shortly after his brother's death, Joseph foolishly agreed to put his name, with another party, to a document as surety for a young man who was to take upon himself the duties of a collecting clerk in a re spectable firm in tbe city. The young man before twelve months bad past, was discovered to be a defaulter to a pretty large amount. Tho gentlemen constituting the firm demanded the amount from Joseph Pratt, his fellow surety having embarked for America a couple c f months before the defalcation had been discovered. Joseph paid every penny, and left himself with little or no capital to carry on his business, which consisted in buying up silks, satins, alpacas, and matei i the like nature, getting them embroidered to designs of his own inven ting, and then selling them to the different warehouse* in the city. K was indeed hard work for him to advance against such an overwhelming catastrophe. He could not now .buy for ready money articles cheap and good, nor could he take advantage of the markets; as a matter of consequence, he got in debt with his silk inercer and others, and being obliged to cut down the working girls in their wages, they did not take that care in their work which they had hitbei to done ; Us jrood.s m(.t With a very slow sale in consequence, and at a great reduction in the"], [21, "AUST ELIZA-!

ThiB was continually praying on his mind, and working hard from morning until night, he became ill, and died In the manner de scribed, leaving his wife and child, and his nephew and niece without a penny, or a relative in the world. The furniture was all they had, and how soon ohc of the creditors might put in an execution it was not pos^ sible to say ; but j udging from their general alacrity, and their anxiety to be the first in, it would not have argued a man's insanity if ka gs.** a week as the longest time for their doing it, especially when two or three had already been issued. The slleftCe had hot yet been broken by either party since Mrs. Pratt toad given utterance to the words quoted above. She was still looking into th* fire, and hugging her child to her breast, wondering wBal she should do. She felt that it was necessary to do something, but what that something was she could not divine. The more She eudean voured to think, the greater the difficulty seemed to appear ; attfl 86 she turned her eyes from the fire \u2014 which in its brightness seemed tb mock her \u2014 towards the chair that was always set apart for hei- hasbahd, and which she had so affectionately padded and made soft, that his deal bones might rest and comfort themselves of a night before that fire, she shftddered and burst ifit'o tears. \"Oh, God!*1 she exclaimed, '\"how lonely I shall feel-^-h-s l__-t thoughts were for me* \" Don't despair, Aunt,\" ret ttrned George, putting his knee out tt hi_, hand, and leaning forward towards the weeping woman, \u25a0 I'll try and do something .\" But befote he had finished the sentence-, tl-Oagt he had began it very manfully indeed, he had burst into teats. \" And so can _, Aunt ; I'll try _.nd get into 4 gentleman's family.\" Amelia said this very quietly, 4nd her hands kept up the desited amount of friction, but no tears dimmed h\u00abr eye. \" Oh, no, no ! Don't talk of leaving tne like that,\" exclaimed Mrs. Pratt, or, as we shall continue to Call her, Atint Eliza. \" Am I not lonely enough by losing your uncle Joseph . What shall 1 do if yefc both fly from me directly ? As it is I do have some faces to look at, whose feelings are something akin to my oWn.\" \" Yes, Aunt,\" returned her niewi, \" I donvt wish i* leave yott, I'm sure ; and if you think I could help you, and be of Use to yoti, __nd make yoar work come lighter to yon, I WoUld stay with you with all my heart, and never leave you while you wished me stay ; but I've been thinking ever sisiee uncle died hoW we could manage ; I've laid awake at night listening to your sobs, and wondering and wondering how I could help you.

Unless yoa have some idea, I see no other plan than what I've said. What you and baby will do, I never could make out.\" \"You talk quite coolly,\" returned Aunt Eliza, \"as if want were not Btaring you in the face ; as if you had only to go to the corner of the street and have all your wishes granted you. I hav'nt seen you (bed a tear since \u2014 since .\" \" True, Aunt, I have not, I feel I cannot. I would give anything to do so ; but my head feels hot and feverish, and I have such a heavy weight upon my chest that almost prevents my breathing. It is not for the want of feeling that I don't cry. I never felt so wretched or so lonely as I do this very night. I feel it here, Aunt \u2014 here, in my chest and throat ; but tears, they are not permitted me.\" Bending her head slightly forward, her eye stared vacantly at the fire, and her band resting in her lap, continued to experience the nervous passing up and down of its fellow. \" I did not mean to chide you, dear,\" returned Aunt Eliza. I see you feel, and thank God, that with it all you can think. I cannot. I have tried, oh, 60 hard, to think what had better be done ; but the only thought that I am capable of, is poor dear Joseph. It steals upon me when I would try and turn my attention to other matters, and takes possession of my mind, driving out all other thoughts As I sit here, and try to think, I fancy I can hear his foot on the step outside ; I seem to be waiting for his coming from the city, and yet I know he's dead. I look up and think I shall see him in his chair, then for a moment think bow late he i_ ; and yet I know he's dead. I can't divest myself of the thought that he is Dear me, and that I can speak to him. I look around me in the vain hope of seeing him, and yet I know he is dead.\" \" We must not hang upon the past, dear Aunt,,\" returned Amelia, \u2022* it is the future that we have to think of now. Talk of that, Aunt, \u2014 act on that, I think it better.\" \" I can't to-night, indeed I can't ; I will see to-morrow,\" returned Aunt Eliza. The child in her arms began to cry and grow restless. Her niece reached out her hands to take it from her. *' Oh ! no, do not take it from me ; it is the only consolation that I have. I feel when it is in my arms that I have something of poor Joseph near me still . And he did love it so. All the time that he was ill he would not let it leave the room ; and when it cried, he always seemed to forget his own pain, and said ' poor thing,' and tried to comfort it. It is all I have to live for now, is this poor fatherless child. If this leaves me, I care not how soon I'm in my grave too.1*"], [23, "aunt eliza's GArtr.r.T. 11 For some short time they sat in silence, disturbed only by the patter ing of the rain upon the Window glass, and the howling of the wind. Presently the sound of a distant footstep struck upon the ear ; it gets nearer and nearer ; stops, and then presently is heard in the kitchen a low rumbling knock at the door. \" I wonder who that can be !\" exclaimed Amelia, turning \u00bbto her Aunt. \" Do you expect any one to-night ?\" \" No,\" returned Aunt Eliza ; \" it is some of the work-girls come for their money perhaps.\" \" It can't be that,\" said George, \" I looked their book over myself, and paid them all up with my own hands ; and so I know that that's not it.\" \" Well, it is of no use keeping them in the rain, whoever it is,\" ex claimed Amelia, taking up the candle and hastening to the door. George and his Aunt being left in the dark sat and listened. \"Ah \u2014 ahem !\" exclaimed some voice that was rather familiar to tbe ears of George and his Aunt. \"Good evening, miss. Ahem! I have taken the liberty of calling upon you this evening upon a little business.\" \" Oh. come inside, sir, please,\" returned Amelia. \" Thank you, you're very kind. Ahem ! I hope I have not intruded upon your privacy. I certainly was aware of your serious loss \u2014 ahem! \u2014 and that, in a great measure, is the reason I have called this evening.\" \" If I understood you rightly,\" exclaimed Amelia, in that quiet voice of hers, \" you said you had some business \u2014 is it urgent ?

With pleasure, miss.\" And straightway Amelia led tho visitor to the kitchen. \" Who is it, Amelia ?\" asked Aunt Eliza, without turning to look. \" It is Mr. Quisby, Aunt,\" returned Amelia; \"he has called upon some urgent business.\" \" It's very cruel of him to come to-night.

He was of the middle height, with dark hair inter- mingled here and there with a few silvery ones. It was carefully brushed off his forehead, for the purpose of giving him a somewhat intellectual appearance ; his eyes, dark and twinkling, stood out boldly and prominently, looking very much like two large magnified lobster- eyes, and made you feel very uncomfortable every time you looked at them, for they seemed to hang by such a little thread, that the least shake in the world would make them drop out; his eye-brows were high and arched ; the nose long and aquiline ; his whiskers were kept closely trimmed, and round his mouth there was \u2014 when he was ad- dressing any one in a friendly way \u2014 a smile continually playing; but if he were opposing any individual in argument, his face expressed \"the sublime indignation* -which he said he felt. Mr. Sublimus Quizby wished to comSbine the pions and the fast young man together, although, bear in mind, he was fast verging upon fifty. He dressed carefully and neatly, and thought himself in every respect \"the cheese.\" He believed his figure to be manly and commanding, his manner winning and graceful, bis step light and elastic. What hiB neighbours thought of him was, simply that he was a conceited coxcomb, apedantic fool, and an affected puppy. Some used a stronger expression, and Harry, one of the carmen to the establishment Us which Quizby belonged, and who was a bit of a sportsman and dog- fancier, has been heard to say, \"that he believed he was a cross, between a well-educated monkey and a shocking bud dandng master, and that his mother must have had great partiality for lobgters when they were out of season, and could not be obtained.\" Mr. Sublimus Quizby had been sent to a good school when a boy, he therefore fan- cied himself a well-educated man, always thrusting in, whenever there was the slightest chance, little portions of latin, that he remembered reciting out of the Eton Grammar ; and when amongst those whom he thought did not understand the language, he gave a ridiculous trans- lation, yet something true, and which he thought was very witty and very fast. Sublimus knew everybody, and everybody's business. There was not a single person in the peerage that he did not know and had not spoken to. He had heard Her Majesty speak to Prince Albert, and he had spoken to His Royal Highness. He was a great friend of the mayor of Southampton, of whom he used to say, \" my friend, thai mayor of Southampton.\" He had had an hotel in tbe Isle of Wight, and he would be continually Teciting some anecdote that had occurred"], [25, "AUNT ELIZA'S GARRET. 13 while he was thare. It was always the Isle of Wight ; and when the newspaper said anything about Southampton and its mayor, \"my friend, the mayor,\" was always on his lips. He was a great soother, in his way, of the distressed ; he was likewise a great slanderer, and had a very peculiar habit of telling lies in their most mischievous form \u2014 that is, by blending so much of truth with them, that it was difficult to separate the truth from the falsehood, and rendered it still more diffi cult for the party slandered to deny it. \"Ahem!\" and Sublimus gave a good tough tug at his waistcoat, preparatory to addressing his consolatory speech to Mrs. Pratt. \"I am really sorry, madam, to see you thus \u2014 ahem ! \u2014 I can fully appre ciate your feelings. I recollect how my mother felt when my father died. But we must try and bear up against it, indeed we must \u2014 - ahem ! You had a very quiet funeral.\" \"Yes, sir,\" returned Mrs. Pratt, \"but not so good a one as I should have wished \u2014 funerals are expensive.\" \"You are quite right, madam \u2014 ahem! \u2014 yon would scarcely believe it, I dare say, ma'am, that when I paid my father's undertaker's bill, I paid down upwards of forty pounds ; I did, indeed, down apon the nail.\" \" Indeed, sir,\" exclaimed George, who was inclined to be rather mischievous with his tongue: \"what upon the coffin nail?\" \" Fie ! George, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.\" The smile that was half inclined to break out upon his face made c very hasty retreat, and George, feeling as if he had not done just tht thing, began once more to nurse his knee very energetically. \"You said,\" continued Amelia, addressing herself to Sublimus, u you said, I think, sir, that you had called on business.\" \"Ahem !\" with another tug at the waistcoat, and covering his saw with smiles. \" You're right, miss \u2014 tempus fugit. It is getting late, and Mrs. Quizby will be wondering whither I am gone ; but \u2014 sera nunquam est ad benos mores via \u2014 ahem! \u2014 that is, young gentleman, when duly translated, ' to turn over a new leaf is never too late.'

When I went to the counting-house this morning, I heard it whispered that Henry, the youth, was going to leave. Recollecting under what circumstances my friend, Mr. Pratt, had left you, for we were old cronies when we met in the city, 1 made up my mind \u2014 ahem ! \u2014 to speak to the governor on this young gentleman's behalf. I believe I speak the truth, when I say that I possess some interest with the gover nor \u2014 ahem! \u2014 I think I may state that without contradiction. He"], [26, "14 ACNT ELIZA'S GARRET. listened to me very patiently \u2014 ahem! \u2014 as I lucidly explained to him the circumstances in which you as a family are placed \u2014 ahem !\" \" And his answer, sir ?\" asked Amelia and George, in a breath. \" Well, I fancy a very fair one \u2014 ahem ! \u2014 though it held out no pro mise \u2014 ahem ! It was simply this : \u2014 Let the young fellow come to me between ten and eleven to-morrow, and 111 talk to him about it. Very good, sir, said I, and bowed myself out.\" \"Is he a nice, pleasant man?\" asked George, anxiously, after Sublimus had been nearly overwhelmed with thauks. \" He is strict, certainly,\" returned Sublimus, \"but a very nice man to talk to.\" \" Does the one now leaving do so for any fault ?\" asked George, \" I will explain to you \u2014 ahem ! When I saw Henry this morning, who by the way would be a very steady youth indeed, if he were not too much addicted to low conversation \u2014 ahem ! \u2014 smoking, and having no respect for his elders, and well-educated men, like myself for instance. And you know Cicero says, Adolescenlis est majores natu revereri ; that is, young men should mind their p's and q's when addressing their elders. Well, when he came into the counting-house, I addressed those beautiful words of Ovid to him : \u2014 Quis te mini easus ademit ; whidi, when rendered in the vulgar tongue capable of your understanding, is: \u2014 what's the row, that takes you from us? He replied, I've got a better birth \u2014 ahem ! And you in time may do so too, most likely \u2014 will you not ? But I must go mihi istie nee seritur, nee metitur ; that is, now I've prepared the ground for you, you must do your own farming yourself. I have nothing more to do. I shall feel hurt if you say another word about thanks. I am like my friend, the mayor of Southampton \u2014 who has been a hard-working man in his time, I must tell you \u2014 I must always be trying to do some good for somebody ; it is our duty as Christians. But I must haste, Mrs. Quizby will be wondering whither I am gone to. You won't fail to come to-morrow \u2014 will you ? That's right. Good night, ma'am, I wish you all the support necessary to you during your trials. Good night.\" And with a light step, and two or three \" ahems,\" he passed through the door into the rain, and turned towards home. It is asserted that there is something good about a man, however bad he may be, and whatever amount of mischief Sublimus Quizby had done during his life, he had succeeded, at least, in putting a little sunshine in Mrs. Pratt's kitchen."], [27, "aunt eliza's 0ARRET 15 CHAPTER III. The morning, according to the natural course of events, arrived on which George was to make his first endeavour to obtain employment. With a palpitating heart he walked with his patron, Sublimus Quizby, to the offices of Messrs. Thompson, Hickory and Thompson, merchants, of the City of London. It being too soon for George to make his ap pearance, he contented himself by walking up and down before the counting-house door, building up an innumerable number of castles of fairy-like form, but which, for the want of a good foundation, performed that peculiar trick attributed to the witches in Macbeth, that is, made themselves air. At length he found himself introduced to a little old gentleman, with a shining bald head, high forehead, large blue eyes, rather bushy whiskers, small Roman nose, aud a largish mouth. He was rather stout, and attired in an old-fashioned dress-coat with bright buttons, old-fashioned trousers, frilled shirt, white waistcoat, and low shoes. His step was short and quick, his voice and temper to match. He was an excellent man of business, and had originally arrived in London with scarcely any money in his pocket ; but his Buccess had not hardened his heart, and no man was more imposed upon by those who make it their business to obtain a living by false pretensions of woe than he was. Such was Jacob Thompson, the founder of the firm. When George entered, he was busily engaged in reading some letters that had arrived by that morning's post. Putting down the one which he had in his hand, he bowed very politely to George, smiled, pointed to a chair, and bade him \"good morning.\" \" Good morning, sir,\" returned George, turning his hat round and round in his hands, and making au awkward kind of bow. \"I've called, sir,\" he continued, about a place that I'm told by one of the gentlemen will shortly be vacant.\" \"Exactly so; pray be seated, young gentleman,\" returned Mr. Thompson, again pointing to a chair close to his writing table. George complied by seating himself very uncomfortably on the edge of a chair, and putting his hat on the ground. \" And so you think you would like to become a clerk in my esta blishment\u2014aye ?\" asked Mr. Thompson. \" Yes, sir,\" returned George. \" Have you been in a eounting-hpusc before V inquired Mr .Thompson. \" No, sir, I have only marked for my uncle,\" returned George, in a rather broken voice, and a tear just springing to his eye ; \"but if you"], [28, "16 AUNT eliz.'s OARRST. would take me, sir, if I don't know much, I'd try and please yon, sir, and I'd be very careful, and not make mistakes.\" The old gentleman leaned back in his chair, and thrusting his hands into his trousers pockets, smiled, looked at George, and said : \u2014 \" Well done, young gentleman, you said that very earnestly. I believe it came from the heart, and I think you'll do. I like earnest people ; but remember this, don't tell me a falsehood, I can forgive anything but that. You may commence your duties to-morrow, if you like. We'll put you on at eight shillings a week. That's in consideration of your unfortunate circumstances. Henry, who is now leaving ub, came for two years without any fixed salary, ahd a very good boy he's been \u2014 very good boy, indeed. I otily hope when you and I part, I may be able to say the same of you.\" \" I hope so too, sir, with all my heart,\" returned George. \"You'll be here to-nioxrow then, at nine. Good morning\" And the old gentleman ajrain took up his letter, and commenced reading it. George, feeling that his presence wa3 no longer desired, rose from his chair, bade him \" good morning,\" and bowed himself out. As George stood outside Mr. Jacob Thompson's office door, he could scarcely believe that he Was one of the clerk's belonging to the firm of Thompson, Hickory, and Thompson. The interview had scarcely lasted five minutes, and he had past in that time from a nothing into a full blown clerk, at eight shillings a week. \" Ahem ! Well, friend, how fares it V exclaimed Sublimus Quizby, as he was passing from one room to another. \" Why, Tm to come to-morrow,\" returned George, delighted at his success, \"and begin my duties forthwith. He waB hot long about deciding.\" \" Ah 1 ejaculated Quizby, \" he never is ; he wastes no time I can tell you. He fancies he can read one's character directly he looks at him, and no one is so much mistaken as he. Are you to have a salary ? I ehould suppose not at first.\" \"Yes, lam; eight shillings a week,\" returned George. \" Ah, well, come that's liberal. It will doubtless be a great help t* your Aunt. But we must wet it you know, or we cannot expect things to work smoothly \u2014 aye T -What d'ye mean?\" demanded George, \" Why, you must stand treat \u2014 ahem !\" \" Oh, I see,\" returned George. \"Of course you'll do that whiefc is right,\" ftoniinned Sublimus in his most winning manner. \" Of course I'm willing to do what's proper,\" was George's reply#"], [29, "aunt eliza's garret. 17 M But how can I? I have only sixpence in my pocket, and that was the last my Aunt had got, and she gave it me to pay my omnibus hire, because I should not tire myself too much by walking so far.\" **0h, nonsense, walk back, man, it. will do you good,\" returned Quizby. \"That's what I thought of doing, and giving Aunt the money back again.\" \" Well,\" ooutinued Quizby, \u00ab I did not suppose you were so mean as. that comes to. You're nothing like you're uncle; heit>__\u00bb a generous fellow.\" \"So am I!\" returned George, rather warmly ; \"and I'm sure I'm anxious to do right. If I ought, as you say, to stand something, and jf what I've got is of any use, why I'm willing to do it,\" \"That's right \u2014 bravely spoken,\" exclaimed Quizby, \"weean have at least a pot of sixpenny between us ; and as ii, is near lunch-time I'll step out and have it with you. At the same time I can possibly give you some advice that might, be of use to your Aunt.\" So saying, Sublimus, with a light step, rendered still more light by the sixpenny ale in perspective, reached his hat from the peg, and walked with his arm in that of the lads towards the nearest public house ; where, having drunk the greatest portion of the ale, and eaten tlie whole us the sandwiches which Mrs. Quizby had put in his pocket, without offering any to George, returned to the counting-house, leaving George to walk to Islington. As soon as Quizby had taken his seat at his desk, he turned round to his fellow clerk, who was somewhat his superior, and said : \u2014 \" What do you think, Mr. Stedman ? Our old governor has actually taken on a youth to fill Henry's place who knows nothing \u2014 actually nothing, Mr. Stedman. AVould you think it pos sible ? But here's the great absurdity, and I may say, Mr. Stedman, injustice of the matter \u2014 the youth's to have a salary of near ten shil ling, a week. Would you think it poss-vble? And I can assure you, sir, if you believe me, he knows nothing.' \"Indeed!\" qu->tly rejoined the gentleman addressed. \" I think it very unfair \u2014 don't you, sir ? Here am I, sir, working from the time I come in the morning until I leave at night, upon a paltry salary, and a boy \u2014 a know nothing \u2014 to whom it's usual to give no salary at all, is to have nearly one half what I get myself. It is not fair. The next time I see Mr. Thompson I shall demand a'riste ; I shall indeed, sir \u2014 ahem!\" \u2014 a tug at the waistcoat. \"I shall say to him thus :\u2014 \" '\u25a0 You may depend upon it you won't get it ; and 1 think you bad better not try,\" returned Mr. Stedman, interrupting Sublimus."], [30, "18 AWNT ELIZA'S GARRET. \"You'll see,\" rejoined Sublimus, \"I don't Intend to let the mattes lrop, I assure you, sir. I cannot but feel a sublime indignation in the i.ay I'm treated.\" After having delivered himself to this effect, he turned round upon his stool and proceeded ouward with his work. In the meantime George was hastening back to Islington to impart to his Aunt and sister the joyful news of his success, and to render them all the assistance he could during the few short hours that might be called his own. The advice he had received from his friend, Sub limus, he thought was good, and he wished his Aunt to act upon it without delay. Having at length reached home, he was greeted with the words : \u2014 \" Well, what success t\" from both his Aunt aud sister. \" I'm engaged, and at a salary too,\" returned George ; who then related to them all that had transpired. \" And now,\" said he, \" I have got a little to say about home. Old Sublimus, though he is a rum old buffer, is one of the wide-awake fellows \u2014 at least, when it touches tho pocket ; and he thinks our best plan would be to get a couple of rooms nearer the city for the present, move our furniture there, shut up the house, and send the key to the landlord. We shall by that means prevent any of the creditors coming in ; and what things we did not want, he says, we had better sell, and that would supply ug with ready money for a little time, during which you could be making up your mind what you'll do.\" \"I don't know but what that would be about the best thing we could do,\" returned Amelia. \" What do you think, Aunt ?\" \" I don't care how soon we move out of this bouse ; I can't bear it now Joseph's gone,\" was Aunt Eliza's reply. \" Well, then, I'll tell you what we'll do,\" exclaimed George, \"we'll have a bit of dinner, aud then, seeing it's my laBt day at home, we'll all three go hunting up apartments. It'll do Aunt good \u2014 it'll do us all good. Won't it, Joey \u2014 aye, my boy?\" The latter part of this speech was addressed to the baby, who seemed to have an idea that some fun was intended, and had made up his mind to enjoy it. \" Aye, but how are we to get a dinner? that's the thing,\" returned Amelia, with that slow, quiet voice of her'e, which always became still more slow and quiet in proportion to the perplexity of her position. \" Aunt and I have been thinking all the morning and puzzling our brains about it,\" \u2014 here Aunt Eliza began to sob again, \u2014 \" but we could come to no conclusion.\" \" I never gave anything away with so bail a grace as I did that ale this morning,\" exciaimed George, \"and on my word I feel to grudge it iiiju!\""], [31, "AUNT ELIZA'S OARRET. 19 \" Oh ! that were wrong in you, George,\" returned Amelia. \" I don't know so much about that. It seems hard to be obliged to treat a man to drink when you want treating to a dinner,\" replied George. \" That sixpence would have done us more good than the ale will do him, I'll be bound. What's to be done?\" \" Ah ! what's to be done .'\" reiterated Aunt Eliza. \" To think that I should come to this \u2014 to know what it is to want a meal. Oh ! it's horrible !\" \" Oh ! don't go on so,\" exclaimed George, \" surely we can do something for a dinner. Yes, I have it ! To be sure. Can't we pawn something ?\" \"We might do that, certainly,\" returned Amelia ; \" I never thought of that.\" \" But who can do it ?\" asked Aunt Eliza. \" I'm sure I never heard such a thing hinted at before.\" \" Oh, I'll manage it somehow,\" said George. \"You give me some thing ; leave the rest to me.\" \" What can you take?\" asked Amelia. \" Oh, I don't know,\" returned George ; then continuing in a hasty whisper, \" uncle's last new coat, perhaps, would lie the best.\" Amelia looked an affirmative, and at once left the room, followed by George. Having got the coat out of the box and tied it carefully up, she handed it to George, who forthwith sallied out upon his first pawning excursion. Taking a hasty walk to get out of the immediate neigh- bourhood for fear he should be recognized, he at length arrived opposite one of his relatives. George's heart here failed him. He walked back- wards and forwards, looking to see if any one were notidng him. He had an idea that his purpose was so plainly depicted, that everybody must see what his intentions were. Then he fancied he did not like the look of the house, and that he would wait and see if any one else went in. So passing over to the other side of the road, he kept np a vigilant watch for about a quarter of an hour. From this he was satisfied that the man must have had plenty of custom, so re-crossing the road, he made a sudden rush, and passed through into one of the little boxes that those worthy gentlemen construct for the purpose of holding a private and strictly confidential interview with their numerous nephews. He had been standing there about five minutes, when his neighbour in the next box, who had grown rather impatient at the delay, called out : \" Now, then, George !\" George shrunk back, thinking some one had seen and recognized him. \" Do you hear, George ? Why don't you come for'ard '!\""], [32, "20 AUNT SLIZA'S GARRET. George, thinking that he had been seen and that escape was oselcss, came forwai d, and, looking into the other box, asked :\u2014 \" What is it, sir ?\" \" Oh ! my eye, Jack, here's a green 'un wants to know what's in the wind ! That's likely, ain't it ?\" \" Rayther, I should say.\" \u00ab Tickerly so.\" \" Dnkimmon.\" \u00ab' Would the gemmon like to be Introduced to Nunky T \" Now, then, just, hold that noise a moment will yer, or else I won't serve you at all,\" cried out the pawnbroker's man, who, seeing the embarrassment of George, came at once to his relief ; a piece of civility rather rare amongst that class of mon. \" I say, George, that's nol fair ; I've been waiting longest,\" exclaimed \"the man who had been calling him so vehemently. \" Ye6,\" replied the pawnbroker's man, whose name the reader will perceive was George, \" you are too amusing, we don't like to part from you. What is it ?\" he continued, addressing George, \" I want you to lend me as much as you can upon this coat,\" replied George, handing the coat over the counter. \" Fifteen shillings,\" exclaimed the man, holding the article up and examining it. \" Not more !\" ejaculated George, \" why, it's only a fortnight ago my uncle gave four pound ten for it.\" \" It's a very nice cloth, certainly,\" returned the man, \"but it's not the thing for us. I'll say seventeen, and not a farthing more.\" \"Very well,\" said George, glad enough to get the matter settled and to get out of the place. \"There you are, sir,\" returned the man, throwing down the dupli cate, which some one has described as being the first ' turnpike ticket. on the road to poverty,' \" and there's the money.\" \" Thankyou, sir,\" replied George, taking up the ticket and the money. What's this?\" he continue.!, holding the ticket out towards the man. \"Oh, ray eye, what a green'un !\" exclaimed the noisy gentleman, \" I wonder he's got through the streets safe ; I should a thort some o' them half-starved cab 'osses would have pitch hinto him, and thort they was a heating grass.\" \"It's a duplicate,\" returned the man, wondering whether George was really a fool or not, \" a mere receipt that we have got your goods, which we will give up to you when you bring the money and that ticket back again.\"'"], [33, "GEORGE'S FIRST VISIT 10 HIS OSCLB's 8"], [34, ""], [35, "AUNT BLIZA's GARRET, 21 \"Oh, and that's a pawnbroker's duplicate,\" muttered George to himself, as he went back to his Aunt's, turning it over and over. \" Well I've read about 'em in the paper, but I never saw one before, and I hope I may never see another.\" CHAPTER IV. George, as soon as he reached home, handed the money and the ticket to his sister, who immediately set about getting a dinner upon the most economical terms possible, which having been eagerly partaken of by all parties, they began to feel themselves in a better condition to go to work in right good earnest. Aunt Eliza seemed to have a little energy- still left her, and bustling about soon got herself ready to accompany George and Amelia, the latter of whom had already the baby in her arms, on their hunting expedition ; for it is a hunt, and a most tiring one, going after apartments when you want nice, healthy, cheap and comfortable ones, close upon the boundaries of the city. After a great deal of walking about, going up and down stairs, and lookiug in here and there, they at last fixed upon two rooms at the top of an old house in the neighbourhood of London Wall. Aunt Eliza certainly did not admire the locality, but what was she to do ? They were only three shillings a week, and it certainly was best to move at once while she had the things by her ; if she delayed much longer in all probability she might lose them entirely. So having in this manner reasoned herself into taking the apartments, there was nothing left to be done but to arrange with the landlady, who happened to be a widow also, and of course had a fellow feeling for her in-coming tenant. \" Who will you give me as reference !\" demanded the landlady. This regularly startled them. They had not in the least manner expected that a reference would be required, and as they did not wish any one to know of their moving, it seemed to be an obstacle that was not likely to be removed. \" I never takes any body without a reference,\" continued the woman, \"I'm but a poor, lone woman, depending entirely on what I makes by my rooms.\" \" We have no one that we can refer you to,\" returned Amelia. \" Our intentions are honest \u2014 \" 2"], [36, "22 vlCST ELIZA'S CA__RE_- \u2022 \u00ab What are ye going to do for yer living, young woman, and to pay \u25a0my rent? Aye\u2014 just tell me that? It strikes me, ye'll have a little trouble to do that I fancy.\" \"My brother here is in a situation,\" returned Amelia coolly, whilst Aunt Eliza, feeling some of the first pangs of poverty, began to weep, \" and this lady and I are going to try to get embroidery to do.\" \" Humph ! All very well, but I don't know-you, you know. I must have a reference.\" \" I am very sorry then ; we cannot give you one, but \u2014 \" \" Well, what was you going to say i\" asked the woman, seeing that Amelia hesitated. \"I was going to say,\" continued Amelia, \" that as there must be some degree of confidence put by one of us in the other, suppose, as you appear afraid to trust us, we trust you ; we'll pay you a week in advance.\" George and his Aunt stared. How were they to manage nntil the end of the week, if they were going to give all their ready money away like that? \" We had better do so Aunt I think,\" continued Amelia, addressing her Aunt and George, \"we shall make sure of the rooms, and I dare say we can manage until Saturday. We must learn to live close now.\" \" Well, do as you think best,\" returned Aunt Eliza. \" I care not which way it is ; I suppose it will turn out for the best ; I hope so, God knows.\" \" Well, what do you say to my proposition ?\" demanded Amelia of the landlady. \" Well, miss, if yon make the agreement to pay a week in advance, and keep a week in advance, I've no dislike to them termr \" \"Very well, then, these rooms are ours from to day,\" returned Amelia, as she handed to the woman the first week's rent. \"Yes miss, thank'ee miss; wheu'll ye please to come in miss? I should like to know, cos I'd have the rooms scrubbed down mis.1-, afore ye cnme'd in miss.\" \" We shall come early to-morrow morning,\" returned Amelia. \" Yer could'nt make it a day later could yer miss ?\" asked the woman \u25a0 \" Not very well.\" \"Oh! just as yer please miss; I only spoke cos its rather late to: begin a scrubbing rooms miss, but I'll do it miss, and it'll be nice and dry agin ye come in, so it will miss. Matters being arranged to the satisfaction of all parties, our party. turned their steps once more to Islington, having previously arranged with a man to come the next morning, with a cart to move the things"], [37, "AtJNT ILIZA'S GARRET. 23 they wanted in their new apartments and who would, as he said, give them a fair price for the remainder. \" Well, I think we have done a tidy good day's work,\" exclaimed George throwing himself into a chair. \"But not finished,\" said Amelia. \" Why ! what is there next to be done ?\" demanded Aunt Eliza, \" I'm as tired as a dog.\" \"Well Aunt,\" returned Amelia, \"you sit still and nurse Joey,\u2014 bless his little heart for being such a good boy, \u2014 and George and I will do what's to be done, directly we have had some tea, and a little rest.\" Tea being over Amelia at once commenced packing up what she thought would be most useful, taking care to have all their clothing put into boxes, setting apart only such portions of the furniture as would be actually necessary for them, leaving the remainder for the broker. It was late when George and his sister retired to rest, and they both slept sounder than they had done for a week before. In the morning George passed through the rooms to take a last look of the place, and then started off to the counting-house, just as the cart came to remove the goods. George worked steadily and carefully at the counting-house and succeeded in pleasing the old gentleman, Jacob Thompson, who seemed to take a particular pride in the lad. In the evening he returned to his new home with a light heart ; but when he knocked at the door of the house, he could not help contrasting the difference of appearance between the house in Islington, and the one which was to become his future home ; his heart, therefore, again became heavy and sad. When he entered the apartments he found that everything had been neatly arranged, the room3 looking as comfortable as it was possible to make -them. He certainly did not admire the shut-up-bedstead that they had obtained from the broker in lieu of their old one ; but when it was ex plained to him that it could be folded up in the day time and give them more room, he said : \u2014 \" Ah, well, convenience is everything ; and now let me bear bow you've got on during the day without me to help you.\" \" Famously !\" returned Aunt Eliza, who in consequence of the amount of business she had gone through during the day with the assistance of Amelia, bad had no time to think about her griefs. \" Well, I'm glad to hear that, Joey, my boy ! And how much did you do in the shape of crying and screaming ?\" exclaimed George. \" I'm sure he was a nice good boy \u2014 the little dear \u2014 yes he w_u\u00a3 the little rogue and never cried once\u2014 no he did'nt.\""], [38, "24 acnt eliza's garret. This was half addressed to George by Amdia, bat spoken at the baby who was in his mother's lap before the fire. \" Well, but what arrangements did you make with the broker ?\" con tinued George. \"Amelia will tell yon ; I can't. I feel too tired to talk to night,' returned his Aunt. \" Aster looking over the things and setting apart what we wanted, he valued the rest, and to sum up a long matter in a short space, we find ourselves after paying all the little bills in the neighbourhood, which by tbe way came to about four pounds, just five pounds four and seven-pence in pocket.\" \" Five pounds four and seven-pence,\" muttered George, \" and have you any idea how long that will, with my money, keep us?\" \" If we were to depend only on that, not very long George,\" returned Amelia, \" but Aunt and I think of going out to-morrow morning, directly you are gone to the counting-house, to see if we can get some work.\" \" Ah, I see,\" continued George, \" now comes the tug. If all things go on as smoothly as they have gone yesterday and to-day, we shall have no cause to grumble, \u2014 what do you think Aunt ? \" \" Yes, it has gone smoothly at present, but going down hill is easier than going up. I'm sure I shall never have the face to go into the warehouses and ask for work ; go to men possibly that Joseph has employed to work for him. I'm sure it will kill me at once, if I meet wy of their impertinent remarks.\" \" Ah,\" muttered George, \" I used to cut some of the girls off pretty ijarp myself; I never thought that Meely might be similarly situated und subject to the same remarks. That won't be very pleasant, will it ? \" \"Wdl, we need not magnify things,\" exdaimed Amelia, \"surely there must be some pleasant people, as well as ill-natured ones. You were not always sharp yourself, George, I know.\" \" I dons know ! I overheard oldSublimi_3 \u2014 do you know I've taken a great dislike to that man \u2014 tell one of the clerks that I was a con \u00bbeited fool and that he did'nt think I should suit ; and that Aunt was anything but an honest woman, for that he had heard you bad removed your goods away from the creditors, and that you had cheated the landlord out of his rent, nor paid any one their money.\" \" The good for nothing man,\" exdaimed Aunt Eliza and Amelia ia a CM-tU-. \" I thought so too, and I was a good mind to tell him about it, but_ HkMignt they would say I was listening, and I'm sure we have not done \u2022 ttung but what he advised.\""], [39, "AUNT EMCa'S OARRET. 25 \" Wdl, well,\" exclaimed Amelia, \" he way talk as much as he pleases, but if he puts as much of his Latin in his conversation as he did the other night, I should think he would not get many listeners, the old stupid.\" \" He does do it, then, lean tell you,\" returned George. \" One would think he had read all the books in the world in that language, and na other.\" \" Ah ! never mind him,\" exclaimed Aunt Eliza rather pettishly, \" get your tea, dear, for I'm sure you must be tired, and then as it is getting late and we want to be out early, we'll see about going to bed.\" George soon finished his meal and in a few minutes found himself nicely ensconced in tbe turn-up-bedstead, and Aunt Eliza and Amelia sank to sleep in each others embrace, their hearts full of hope. The morning dawned. The heavens, however, were not bedecked with rosy streaks, nor did the sun smile, nor the sparrows twitter. No ; but the fog, thick and yellow, came down and creeped into every hole and crevice. There was a sound of waggons and carts passing to and fro, beginning their daily business ; but when Aunt Eliza looked out of her bed-room window, she could distinguish nothing in tbe streets beneath. It was as if she were high up in the clouds, and the thick yellow mass of floating, poisonous matter, were swimming between her and the earth. They dressed and breakfasted by candle light. The fog mean while kept thickening ; and now began to mix with it round grains of soot that floated here and there and finally settled down on people's faces or on gentlemen's shirts. In fact they seemed to have some knowledge of the deanest places, and the cleanest things, and took a huge delight in dropping down just were their presence would be most annoying. There was a nasty chilling air, too, which caused the people to move at a brisker pace than was their usual wont ; the coucussioas that took place in consequence became innumerable ; little asthmatical old gentlemen might be seen standing up at the corners of different streets, or in some quiet out of the way nook, barking away in right good earnest whilst tears came streaming down their cheeks, mingling with the blacks thereon, making a perfect rivulet of jet black ink upon a new and economic principle. The pavement by-and-bye got greasy, as if the gods above had had a cooking bout, and had chosen London for the dripping pan. It became quite a scientific matter to turn the corners of the streets in safety, and old ladies passed along iu fear and trembling, whilst the younger ones looked cold and ugly \u2014 not that we mean to say that they were so, that were ungallant, but sunshine manes the plainest of us look blooming, and a cold, chilly, foggy day"], [40, "26 __tJ.IT ELIZA'S OARRIT. in London, detracts wonderfully from the handsomest. Tlie little boys forgot to whistle, and passed along with their beads buried between thdr shoulders and their hands in t'ndr pockets ; or stood shivering in the Btreets, watching the cab horses in the hope that each nne as it -passed would tumble down, so that they might sec the fun occasioned by its kicking and plunging on the greasy stones to right itself. Amidst this fog, and amidst the bustle. Aunt Eliza and Amelia wandered in the search of .vork. Embroidery had just then become the fashion. They had not proceeded far before they saw small bills in the windows of some warehouses, with the words \u2014 \" Embroidery hand, wanted\" imprinted thereon. With a palpitating heart Aunt Eliza entered, leaving Amelia in the street with Joey. \" You are in want of embroidery hands I think ?\" said Aunt Eliza; addressing a tall young man, who was busy at the counter measuring and cutting off pieces of marked alpaca, ready to be handed to the needle girls, whilst a girl at the farther end was engaged sorting silk, and placing the required number of skeins in the centre of each piece, rolled them up ready to be given out. \" Yes,\" returned the man,\" rather gruffly. \" I am anxious to take in some work,\" continued Aunt Eliza ; \" I have been left rather suddenly, and .\" The man looked up, and Aunt Eliza ceased speaking. \" You don't understand embroidery,\" returned the man. \" You mistake,\" answered Aunt Eliza, \" I'm a very good hand.1 \" Now, none of that gahnmon, it won't do with me, you all say that. Who have you worked for ?\" \" For no one,\" returned Aunt Eliza, \"in the capadty of an employed hand. I used to inspect the work brought in by my husband's girls, and used to help when he was pushed for time.\" \" Oh, your husband was in business, was he? What name ?\" Pratt.' \" Pratt, Pratt ; don't know the name, but that's nothing. Where, do you live ?\" Aunt Eliza gave him her address. \" Well, well send you a dress in the afternoon for you to do as a specimen ; the boy shall bring it you. This is the pattern, and mind and let us have it in the morning, first thing.\" \" What do you pay per dress ?\" asked Aunt Eliza. \" Tenpence.\" \" Tenpcnce !\" exclaimed Aunt Eliza, \"you surely must make a mistake.\" \" No, I don't ; tenpence is the price.\""], [41, "\u2022AUNT ELIZA'* GARRE*. 27 \u2022 \" It's impossible that you pay no more than that ! - We always paid half-a-crown a dress.\" ' -*\u2022 It's nothing to me what you paid, that's what I pay. If you don't like it you can leave It alone.\" \u00bb \" Which I certainly mean to do,\" returned Aunt Eliza. - \" Until you think better of it,\" continued the man. The door swung upon its hinges, and Aunt Eliza once more stood in the street. \"How have you succeeded ?\" asked Amelia, upon her Aunt coming towards her. \"Not at all,\" was the reply. \"There was work, certainly, but at such a price that it would never pay. It would have taken about fifteen hours to have done a dress, aud he said tenpence was what he lie paid.\" \u25a0 ; '\". \" Tenpence ! you surely must have misunderstood him, Aunt ? Why ( that's not a penny an hour!\" exclaimed Amelia. \u2022 \" I am not mistaken, indeed,\" returned Aunt Eliza ; \" and what's more, he wanted a spedmen done, and taken in the firet thing in the morning, so that it would have been actually necessary to have sat up all night.\" \" Well, then, he may want,\" returned Amelia, \" as ser as we are concerned ; there are plenty more I dare say.\" So with this idea in their heads, they proceeded still further. They had not gone many yards when they beheld another hand-bill, making the following announcement: \u2014 \"Wanted immediately, one-hundred embroidery hands ! Constant employment and good wages ensured to first-rate hands. \u2014 Enquire within.\" Aunt Eliza and Amelia both entered. They were not, however, wanted there ; but the porter gave them the address of the party who had such an enormous demand for labour ; and again they started with the sure nope of obtaining employment ere they returned home. They at length arrived at the place where so much work was ready to be given away, and with the sanguine hope of success they both entered and walked up to the counter with very bold faces indeed. A short, Jewish -looking man came forward, and demanded, in a manner that he wished to be insinuating and polite, their pleasures. \"We have been informed,\" commenced Aunt Eliza, \" that you have a great demand for embroidery hands, we have, therefore, called to offer our services.\" ,l Indeed!\" returned the man, with a smile that disclosed, not a pearly set of teeth, but a set that might have vied in their blackness with a piece of ebony. \" Will you take a seat V and he pointed to two,"], [42, "28 AL NT ELIIA'S __UU_KT. counter chairs. Aunt Eliza and Amelia at once complied with the request, for they both began to feel tired. . \"I think I am not wrong in my hidear,\" continued tbe man, \"fen 'ave not been hiu the 'abit of working at the business.\" \" My husband was in tbe business,\" returned Aunt Eliza, \" and I used to help him occasionally. He left me very suddenly, and I find it necessary to seek work for a living.\" \" I ham trooly sorry for your misfortune,\" returned the man, endea vouring to look very serious, and casting sly glances at Amelia under his busy eye-brows ; \" and if you would have no objection to give me a spec'-uen of your work, or set down 'ere and do a little, I shall be able to give you a hanswer.\" \u2022\u2022 With pleasure,\" returned Aunt Eliza.\" \" Mrs. Cummings !\" shouted the man up a staircase leading from the shop.\" Yes, sir.' \" Bring me down a dress that's a bdng worked by one o' the 'ands.\" The work was brought and placed in Aunt Eliza's hands first, who forthwith took off her gloves, and commenced operations. Having finished a small piece, she handed it to the man, who declared that it would do, and gave it to Amelia, giving her hand a sly squeeze at the same time. It was, however, done in such a manner, that Amelia thought it was an accident, and that it was his intention to prevent the roll of alpaca from falling on to the floor. She, therefore, _ook no notice of the matter, and went to work and did her best. Her portion having also been submitted to the man's inspection, who, having passed his opinion that it was not quite so good as her Aunt's, tad leaning over the counter, pointed out to her the faults that he would like to be corrected. \" I think,\" however, he continued, \" that we can let you have some to do, and as you work together, possibly this lady will just look over you, and give you a hint how you're going on.\" \" That, of course, I'll do with pleasure,\" returned Aunt Eliza. \" Very good,\" continued the man. \" Our days for bringing work in and giving it out, is Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Xo-day is Thurs day. Wdl, I'll give you enough to last till Monday, and you can then bring this in ; and if it's anything near the mark you can hare more.\" 44 Thank you,\" returned Aunt Eliza and Amelia together. The man at once com_n___oad packing np the work for them. Whilst he was thus engaged, Aunt Eliza said : \u2014 \" Will you allow me to look at the pattern that we are to work V \" Certainly ;\" and at onoe the work was handed to her.

It was given. *' Thank you. On Monday, then, I shall have the pleasure of seeing you again,\" he exclaimed, as he handed them the parcel of work. Yes, dr ; good morning, sir.\" \" Good morning io you.\" And the interview was at an end. When George returned home from the counting-house in the evening, be found his tea all ready for him, and his Aunt and sister dtting at the table \"busily engaged with their work. \"What! you don't mean to say you've got some work already!\" exclaimed George. \" Yes, we have. Are we not lucky J\" returned Amelia. \"And work that's rather profitable into the bargain,\" continued Aunt Eliza. \"Out and out!\" exclaimed George, rubbing his hands and warming them by the fire. \"You'll find you're tea already, dear,\" said Amelia, addressing her brother ; \" you must try and get it by yoursdf to-night, for once.\" \" Ah, never mind me,\" replied George, \" I shall manage all right, I dare say.\" And down he sat and commenced his meal. Monday at length arrived, and the work was taken in and approved of, and more given out. Aunt Eliza and Amelia continued to work kard uutil Friday night at six o'clock, when Amelia put on her bonnj and shawl, and hastened to take the work in. It was near seven o'clock when she arrived at the warehouse. \" Dear me,\" exclaimed Mrs. Cummings, who was the only person to be seen, \" you are very late this evening, you must bring your work in earlier.\" \" I'm very sorry,\" answered Amelia, \" I will attend to it. Can we have any more work to-night >.\" \" Yes, this parcel is for you. Mind and put your best work in ; it's far a new house, and we want it as a sample.\" \"Thank you,\" returned Amelia. \" May I ask when you pay T"], [44, "_*NT BLIZ-Os GARRET. 30 \"Of a Friday afternoon, between two and three,\" returned Mrs. Cummlngs.\" \"Am I too late to receive ours?\" asked Amelia, in a rather disap pointed tone. \" You are, indeed. Mr. Toms has lest some three hours, and wont lie here before Monday morning. He always goes out of town on Saturdays and Sundays. You must let it stand over until next week.1*! \" Oh,- very good,\" returned Amelia; and somewhat disappointed re turned home. But the knowledge of having a little ready money, and that George would bring home some more on the next evening, did not let the matter make a very deep impression on her mind. The next week passed, and Amelia determined to be early enough this time. She arrived at two o'clock at the warehouse, gave h<T work in, and was told to come on the next morning, at nine o'clock, for her money, for that Mr. Toms had just been sent to attend the death bed of his father, he; therefore, could not pay that afternoon. The work would also be given out at the same time.\" At nine o'clock Amelia presented herself at the door. Judge her surprise and consternation when she discovered about sixty people, women and girls, waiting about the door, which was not yet open, but on which was pasted a piece of paper with the announcement :\u2014 \" That Mr. Toms, with great regret, was compelled to announce his total in ability to pay the demands of his hands, and that he advises them to return home and seek work elsewhere.\" The total of Amelia's and her Aunt's earnings came to thirty-seven shillings. . . . About twelve o'clock on the same day the magistrate for that division was waited upon by tbe greatest number of the \"hands\" so cheated, but he could render them no assistance, aud all that they ever obtained was, a few shillings which some kind people sent to the magistrate to be divided amongst them. Thus ended Aunt Eliza's first engagement. CHAPTER V. Ir was with an aching heart Amelia returned home. She and her Aunt had worked hard during the last fortnight, and had been compelled to draw upon their little stock of ready money, to supply themselves with the necessaries of life. They bad gone on, working"], [45, "aunt eliza's garret. 31 with the best of spirit, because they had hoped to have replaced the money, and to have added a few shillings to it. They had in their minds pictured to themselves their working eageriy for some little time, and living close, and saving until they could get a little capital to take a small shop, for the purpose of selling stationery, and letting out books ; yet, at the same time, carrying on their needle-work. Nowr all their hopes were scattered ; instead of their having improved their Circumstances, they had been working hard, yet still going back. Aunt Eliza could scarcely be got to believe it, and it Was not until She herself had gone and read the paper on the door, that she admitted to herself that it was true. Then, Indeed, did she give vent to her grief in tears. She certainly had some consolation in the fact that she was not the only sufferer nor the worst ; for many of the girls, who had worked for the rogue, had not only given their labour, but had laid out their little ready money in the purchase of silk, to do the embroidery with, which cost them at the least a shilling for each skirt, often more, even so much as eighteen-pence, and sometimes two-shillings. Aunt Eliza and Amelia, began to think they had better have taken in the work that would have brought them only ten-pence the dress. They would have received a little and that would have been better than nothing at all. It was with a sad air that Amelia and her aunt welcomed George home in the evening. She who was the most courageous of the three, was very dull and depressed in spirits indeed. Her eyes were red with weeping aud though she continued to repeat, \" Ab, never mind Aunt, it will never do him any good, we shall get some work on Monday, I dare say. If the price be not so good we shall be sure to get it, for we will not work more than one week again without the money\" \u2014 she could not throw off the weight that laid so heavily on her heart. George said \" he thought that they would be sure to get some work somewhere. London was a large place, aud a quantity of work was done in it.\" So it is ; but George had yet to learn that there were a great many more hands to do the work than were required. \" Besides,\" said he, \" you must, look in the Times. I see there are lots of advertise ments for hands, and I should think you might have some success amongst some of them.\" Sunday passed. It was a dull day, indeed, to them. The Sunday before had been a happy one : it had been a day of rest and they had had no thought or anxiety for the morrow. Now their souls were \u2022bowed down by worldly cares, and cruel disappointments. They pos sessed no faith, and hope seemed dying within them. If they had gone from day to day in search of work, and had from day to day returned"], [46, "32 A0HT XUZA'S GARRET. home unsuecess-Ul, they would not have felt so lowly and depressed as they did now in consequence of thei_ loss. Amelia, as soon as possible, hurried out iu the morning, to catch a glimpse of the Times, In looking over the advertisements, one met her eye, which ran as follows, and which she thought would suit her Aunt admirably. \"Embroidery. Fivo hundred hands wanted im mediately for the embroidery. Also wanted an expert hand to act in the capacity of a fore-woman.\" In haste she returned home, and gave her aunt the copy of the advertisement, saying\u2014 \u2022\u25a0 Don't you think you could take that situation of fore-woman, Aunt ? I could have some work at home, I dare say, and take care of Joey While you were at the warehouse.\" t* Yes I could, certainly,\" returned Aunt Eliza, \" and I dare say it would come more natural to me than anything else, but then I doubt much whether I shall get it. I will go at once. Possibly I may be fir.-.t, and may have a better chance in consequence.\" Driven as it were by desparation, Aunt Eliza hurried towards the place mentioned in the advertisement. She had the good fortune to be the first applicant. She was desired to take a seat, by a youth about fifteen, .. hich she accordingly did. For about half an hour was she kept waiting ; during which time she observed a great number of badly dressed girls, varying in ages from fifteen to twenty, with the exception of one or two elderly women, enter and pass through the room \u2014 or rather shop \u2014 into a bade room, from which emanated a most discordant noise. Aunt Eliza sat and amused herself by listening to the noise, and trying to discover how it was created. At length, a rather tall, stout, dark, well-made man entered, through a glass door, into the shop. He glanced at Aunt Eliza, frowned slightly, and demanded what she wanted. \" I have called in reference to an advertisement which appears in to day's Times.\" \" Yes ; do you mean for the forewoman's place?\" \" Predsdy so,\" returned Aunt Eliza. \" Have you ever filled a dmilar situation V demanded Mr. Jones, for euch was the man's name, and a thorough-bred Welchman he was. Sis his gutterals plainly testified. Aunt Eliza told him \" no,\" but explained to him how she had hdped her husband. \" You think you could teach some young hands then T \" Certainly I could.\" \" You see I'm a manufacturer of silk fringe. I employ nearly a hundred hands at it. I have, however, lately undertaken to supply some of the houses with whom I transact business, with embroidered"], [47, "AtTST eliza's garbet. 33 goods ; I am desirous, therefore, of getting as many hanas as 1 possibly can on the premises. I don't care if they dont know anything about it when they first come, my object will be to have them taught, and to make them continue to work a certain time at half-price as a pre mium for being taught the business. Your duty will consist in teach ing and inspecting the young hands, pressing the work, and doctoring up the botched pieces so as to make them pass muster.\" \" It will be rather an arduous undertaking that, I fancy,\" returned Aunt Eliza. \" Oh, not at all,\" continued Mr. Jones, \" if you have got any gumption about you. You can pick out the best hands, and make them assist you.\" \"Yes, there certainly is something in that,\" returned Aunt Eliza. \" Have you brought a specimen of your work ?\" asked Mr. Jones. \" Yes, I have,\" returned Aunt Eliza ; \" this is it.\" \" Ah, this is done very nicely. Just put some work into that, and let me see if you always work alike. There, you can go back yonder.\" So saying, he placed a roll of alpaca into her hands, and pointed to a distant corner of the shop, where she could work unobserved by any one who might enter. Aunt Eliza had not been long engaged at her task, when a rather smartish dressed woman, about thirty, entered the shop, and walked up to the desk at which Mr. Jones was seated. She was rather tall, with a high forehead, jet black hair that hung in ringlets nearly to her shoulders ; her eyes were of the same dark hue, small and piercing ; her nose was aquiline, and her cheek bore a slight pink tinge, whilst her lip3, rather full and pouting, were of a cherry red ; her teeth, however, were of a yellowish tint, as if through taking great quantities of medi cine ; and her dress, though showy, exhibited some degree of taste. It consisted of abodice, fitting tight up in the throat, a showy shawl, with a small collar round the top; her bonnet was of the last fashion, and set her face off to the best advantage. \" Am I addressing Mr. Jones ?\" she demanded, as she threw herself into a chair with the greatest nonchalance imaginable. \" My name is Jones.\" he returned, with a slight bow, aud throwing off a little of the cold austere manner which he had maintained while carrying on his conversation with Aunt Eliz3. \" I have called on you, this morning, as I was passing, in consequence of an advertisement. You are in want of a managre\u00ab, I think?\" \" Exactly so,\" returned Jones, bowing. \" May I be permitted to be considered as a candidate for the situ ation ? I have held similar offices before for some gentlemen in the city. I am an excellent hand at embroidery, and a capital managress*"], [48, "ACHT iuza's garret. 34 \" If you are only one-half so clever at your business as you are beautiful, I am sure you must be,\" returned Jones, bowing and rubbing his hands. The lady laughed heartily at the compliment. Her voice was clear and musical ; and she knew bow to use it to make it the most telling. \" You are a good-for-nothing impertinent man,\" she continued, \" I'm sure you'll never get a lady to stay with you a day if you pay ;hem such uncalled for compliments. \" I'm not paying you a compliment when I say so. May I aBk ,vere you out of town the other day ?\" No,\" returned the lady. \" Why do you ask T \" I thought you were. I could not deem it possible that you were in London when all that fog was. You must have closed your eyes, or I'm sure those dark little twinkling gems must have dispelled it in an instant.\" Again her laugh was heard throughout all the work-rooms, aud one of the girls who was at work making fringe, whispered to her companion \u2014 \" Old Taffy's rather good-tempeied this morning ; something's hap pened to please him.\" \" I s'pose so. It's not often that he stands so much nonsense as is going on in there, is it?\" \" No.\" And twirl went the machine, putting an end to further conver sation between the girls. \" Upon my word, Mr. Jones, I shall be compelled to leave the shop if you continue in that unpardonable manner. I came about business.\" \" Is it possible such an amiable, good-tempered beauty like yourself, can possibly descend to talk about business ! I'm sure if I were the gentleman who had the honour of calling you mine, I would not allow you to soil those delicately formed fingers in the arduous duty of daily work.\" \" Ah !\" sighed the lady in reply. \" So all you gentlemen say ; but I never yet found the man who was willing to make me his.\" \" Impossible !\" \" It's a fact, but it does not make me sad. I laugh at it \u2014 I laugh at them all, and laugh at you. I'm always laughing ; even at my work I'm laughing ; it makes the time fly away without my knowing how it goes. I do declare I'm nearly thirty-one, and not married yet.\" \" It's a pity you and I had not met before,\" returned Jones, rubbing his hands, and his eyes winking and blinking as if he were so delighted with his visitor that he scarcely knew how to contain himself. \" I m afraid I might have popped the question.\""], [49, "AUNT ELIZA'S GARRET. 35 ' \" Ah, ah, ah ! you would not, trust me ; you would have been too much a coward \u2014 ah, ah, ah ! Well, but now to business. Are you inclined to enter into an engagement with me ?\" \u25a0 , \" I'm very Sorry,\" returned Jones, with a very serious face, \" but I engaged with a lady about half-an-hour ere you arrived.\" \".Indeed !\" returned the lady, not appearing in the least disappointed. , \" Or I should have felt a great pleasure in entering into some ar rangements with you ; but possibly she may not suit me. If you will, therefore, give me your address,- 1 shall be enabled to write to you if I should so wish it,\" Aunt Elifca's heart palpitated vigorously. Was it that he had deter mined to have her ? Or, was it a mere put off to the other ? She had given the situation up as lost to her, for she fancied from the way in which he talked to her rival, that he intended to engage her. The lady gave her address to Mr. Jones, and after t .70 or three sly jokes and double entendres, left. In a few minutes Jones went into the little parlour at the side of the shop, and then returned with a great coat on his arm, and a hat in his hand ; having carefully adjusted the nap of which, he approached towards Aunt Eliza, and leaning over her shoulders, examined her work. i \"There, don't be nervous,\" he exclaimed, \"there's no occasion for that. You work capitally ; there can't be two opinions about it. Let me see if you are as good a hand in helping on a great coat as you are at your work.\" . Aunt Eliza, without saying a word, placed the work on the counter, .and rendered him the required assistance. \" Ah, I see you understand the nack \u2014 that's it, well done.\" , \u25a0 And after two or three tugs and puffings and blowings, the great coat was properly placed upon the back of Mr. Jone\u00ab, and his hat on his head. He was about to leave the shop in the sole possession of Aunt Eliza, when she, anxious to know what was his real intention, stopped him as he was passing through the door, and put the following \u2022question to him : \u2014 \" What am I to understand as your reply to my .application ?\" . \" Well, I don't know. What do yon expect as wages ?\" demanded Jones. , \" It would depend upon the number of hours that you would require me to attend,\" returned Aunt EJiza. '. \" Not later than eight in the morning, until whatever work in hand i\u00ab cleared out, ready to be sent to the proper parties the next morn ing, which ought not to be later than nine in the evening. Of course, you can have an hour to dinner, and half an hour to tea.\" ; ,"], [50, "36 A-WT BilBA'S GARRET. \"Should you think a pound a week too much to begin with?\" demanded Aunt Eliza ; \" and if you succeed in obtaining a large number of hands, raising it in proportion.\" \"Well\u2014 ah, I don't know,\" continued Jones, \"I don't fancy that's too much, though I only pay the woman who is over the fringe girls eighteen, but then she docs not have so much bother as you will. / understand that thoroughly, the other I do not ; I shall, therefore have, in a great measure, to depend on you. Well, we will say a pound. You can come to-morrow if you like ; I shall have had the large room overhead got ready by that time.\" \" Very well, sir,\" returned Aunt Eliza, greatly pleased at her success. \" I have also a niece at home, who is a very good hand, she could render you some assistance likewise, but it would be necessary for her to have it at home.\" \u2022' Oh, very well. Here, Tom,\" was Jones's reply. \" Just take this lady's address, and give her those three dresses that are on the parlor table and some silk.\" \" Yes, uncle,\" replied the youth, and at once disappeared after the required articles. \" And put some of your very best work in them,\" continued Jones, \" I want them as samples ; and let me know how long it takes you to do them \u2014 don't forget now,\" and without saying another word he left the shop. It was about eleven o'clock when Aunt Eliza reached borne again, with a bundle of work in her arms, and her eyes beaming with delight. \"Success once more,\" she exclaimed, as she put the work on the table. \" In what way ?\" demanded Amelia. \" Only as regards work, or, have you obtained the situation?\" \"Both.\" \" Thank goodness !\" ejaculated Amelia,\" \" tell me all about it.' Aunt Eliza then 'repeated to her all that had transpired at Jones's warehouse, finishing her remarks with the following observation : \u2014 M So you see, Amelia, if one door shutB another opens. They talk a great deal about distress, and so forth, but, you see, it only requires a moderate amount of perseverance and work is to be found. You may depend upon it, Amelia, that if one behaves oneself with propriety, work is sure to be obtained.\" How soon a little success makes us forget a great disappointment ! So once more smiles and bright hopes began to beam around their hearth. With a light, joyful step, on the following morning, Aunt Eliza wended"], [51, "AUNT ELIZA'S GARRET. 37 her way towards her occupation, carrying, in a finished state, the bundle of work she had received out the day previously. \" Oh, you have arrived at last !\" exclaimed Jones, as she entered the shop. \" Yes,\" returned Aunt Eliza, \" and here's the work.\" \"I wanted to start just five minutes back,\" continued Jones. \"Yon have kept me waiting just that time. It's five minutes past eight. It won't do for a forewoman to be a minute behind time ; and, another thing, I won't have it. I wanted to start at eight ; it will lie quite a quarter of an hour past before I can leave. Now, then, Tom, let'3 have those irons at work.\" \" They are already pressed,\" exclaimed Aunt Eliza. \"What did you do that for? I suppose that d \u2014 d niece of yours has been making some blotches, and you've been trying to hide it.\" \" They are done very nicely,\" returned Aunt Eliza, rather hurt. \" I did nearly the whole of the work myself.\" A young girl, about seventeen, and who bore a strong resemblance to Jones, got slightly behind her uncle \u2014 for such was the relationship between them \u2014 and frowning at Aunt Eliza, made dumb motions to prevent her answering him. While she was doing this, Tom re entered the room with a large hot iron in his band, and gave it to the girl. \" What are you doing that for, you stupid fool ? Ain't you told they are all ready pressed ? Why don't you tie up tbe things, and not keep me waiting like this ? I declare I shall be an hour behind my time, all through losing one five minutes.\" Mrs. Thompson, the forewoman of the fringe hands, just at that moment entered the shop, and was passing through into the work rooms. \" Thompson !\" shouted Jones. \" Yes, sir,\" sharply answered the woman. \" What time do you call this for coming in \u2014 aye '.\" \" Four minutes after eight.\" \" Don't tell any lies now ; it's a quarter if it's a minute. I shall dock you half a day for this, to make you iearn a little punctuality. Good God ! how much longer are you going to be in tying up that parcel ?\" \" It's ready, uncle,\" returned his niece, puttiug it into bis band. \" Humph ! pretty near time, I think ;\" and so muttering to himself he left the shop. \" You seem a little surprised,\" exclaimed Jones's niece, '\u2022 at my uncle's irritability V"], [52, "38 aunt Eliza's gabblT. \"I mui-t confess,\" returned Aunt Eliza, \" that I am by no means favourably impressed by it.\" \u25a0\u2022You must not mind it, however, if you think of staying with us. It is his manner, and the least you say to him the better.\" \" Well, we shall see,\" returned Aunt Eliza. \"AV'hichisto be my room \u2014 do you know ?\" i _\u25a0 \" No I do not -, I have not heard him say a word about it. Suppose you come inside, and look round the fringe bands whi'st he is out ; ho won't be long, and then ail things will be settled.\" \u25a0\u25a0 V,\" ill he really stop half Mrs. Thompson's pay V asked Aunt Eliza, as she entered the rooms where the fringe hands were employed. \"If he thinks of it, be will. I did not see him enter the remark. If he did not, he will forget it before he gets home again ; that is, if all things go right.\" \" He must be a perfect tyrant,\" thought Aunt Eliza, and her he began to fail her. \" By what I've seen this morning, he is just as likely to serve me in the, same way.\" Having gone all through the rooms where the silk fringe hands where at work, and having ascertained that after working twelve hours a day their average earnings came to about eight or ten shillings a week \u2014 one hand said that she had once made eleven \u2014 Jones returned. This time he was in a better humour. The work had been highly spoken of, but he had forgotten to ask Eliza how long each dress had taken her ; he, however, had named a pretty good price, and he felt quite contented. \u2022 Now, then,\" said he, addressing Aunt Eliza, \" less see about set ting you to work. Here, come this way. This room is for you and your bauds. I expect some of 'em to-day and some to-morrow ; in the mean time, I want you to go on with this work.

CHAPTER VI. While Aunt Eliza is engaged with Mr. Jones, we will return with the boy who has orders to take the work to Amelia, who, having finished her household duties, and got Master Joey off into his morning nap, was about to finish a dress of her own, which had been put on one side in consequence of her having been engaged with her embroidery. She was, however, once more compelled to leave it unfinished by the arrival of the work from Jones. As she was standing at the street door, a young girl entered and passed onward up the staircase. Amelia closed the door and followed her. The girl still continued to ascend until she came to the landing on which Aunt Eliza's two rooms were situated. Amelia wondered what she wanted, but that was soon dispelled when she saw her turn towards a door that opened into an empty back room, which she now supposed had been hired by the party before her. \" Good morning, miss,\" exclaimed the young stranger. \" Good morning,\" returned Amelia, \" we are neighbours, I presume ?\" \" If yonder room belongs to you, we are,\" was the reply. \" I only came in this morning.\" \" Are you by yourself?\" asked Amelia. \" Yes, I am, for the present ; yet I think I shall have a young friend"], [54, "40 aunt iliza's garret. next week who will join me, and that, you kuow, will make things come a little lighter.\" \" I mean,\" continued Amelia, \" have yon no mother, aunt, or relative of any kind living with you ?\" \" No,\" returned the stranger, \" I have uo relation that I know of in the whole world. My mother and father have been dead for two years and more.\" \" Dear me ! you must be very lonely when you're by yourself. Do you work at home ?\" \" Sometimes I do ; very often though I am engaged in the warehouse. When I have more time, possibly I may tell you more about it.\" \" .V oil. if you like to bring your work into our room,\" returned Amelia, \" I'm sure you're welcome to do so. I have work to do myself, and we shall be company for one another.\" \"With all my heart ; I'll be with you in a few minutes.\" Amelia then entered her own room and commenced her work ; pon dering, at the same time, over the unfortunate situation of her neighbour, aud thinking to herself, \" well, we are not the wurst sufferers iu the world \u2014 we ought not to grumble.\" While she was making that remark to herself, a small tap was heard at her door. \" Come in,\" exclaimed Amelia. The next moment the door opened and the stranger entered. And now, with the reader's permission, we will attempt to describe her. She was about the middle height, aud if she had had enough of the common necessaries of life, she would have been slightly enboinpoint ; but as it was, there was all the endeavour to make a plump little fifraie of her without success. Her hair was of a dark brown, which, carefully brushed and oiled, was worn a la Victoria ; her eyes were small and dark, and shone like two glass beads ; her forehead, however, was rather low ; her cheek bones, high and prominent, went tapering off towards the chin ; her nose was purely Grecian, and her mouth exceedingly small. She was dressed thinly aud scantily, yet with some show of style and taste, expressive of a wish to make the most of her self; the bodice of her dress was made to fit close up into the throat, or to be capable of being thrown open to allow of a chemisette. \" I don't know but what I shall rather incommode you with my work, it takes a little room.\" \" Indeed ! what is it T demanded Amelia. \" Book stitching.\" \" What's that ?\" \" AVhy, stitching the different sheets together that form one volume, so as to prepare them for the bookbinder.\" \" Indeed,\" returned Amelia. \" la it difficult V"], [55, "aunt eliza's garret. 41 ** It requires some degree of care.\" \" I should think so,\" continued Amelia. \" Why, this is the bible ' Are you going to stitch these together?\" \"Yes, and I must not be long about them; the man is already waiting.\" She therefore sat down, and forthwith commenced her work. \" You said,\" continued Amelia, after a short pause, \" that you had no relative in the world ; you must find it very hard to get along without any help. Have you always lived in London?\" \" Never been out of it, except once, when I went to Greenwich fair. I was born in Baldwin's Gardens, Gray's Inn Lane, and until my father and mother died, I don't suppose I ever went further than a mile from the place. Father was a bookbinder by trade, and a very _|\u00bbod hand he was at it, too ; but he used to drink so, that the money \\ _.nt as fast, aye, and faster than be made it. His name was Green \u2014 mine is Susau Green. Well, father, to make things come lighter, directly I could read and write a little \u2014 he sent me to the charity school \u2014 made me help mother in the stitching. He used to complain of things being paid so bad, and that they kept getting worse and worse ; but if he had been a little more steady, I rather fancy we should uot have been so badly off as we were. This made him keep mother and I as close to work as he possibly could. Well, one Monday he had been out upon the spree, as he called it, and having taken a little more heavy wet than was good for him, he tumbled, by mistake, down a cellar, and hurt his spine. He was taken to King's College Hospital, where he lingered for about a week, and died raving mad. The doctors said it was the effect of the drink upon the brain that made him mad. That I know nothing about. It's very likely it might be, for he very often used to go on when he came home drunk, no better than a madman. Soon after this mother was attacked with a bowe\u00bb complaint; it was a mere nothing at first, she, therefore, took no par- ticular notice of it, and we went ou with our work as well as we pos- sibly could. She was, however, too ill the next morning to go into the warehouse, and so I went instead. I was detained, I should say, nearly three hours ; and when I got home I was told the news that mother had been dead about half-an-hour. I cannot tell you how lonely and wretched I felt. I did not care about my father's dying. It might have been wicked of me in being so careless, but the truth is, he used to work me so hard, and knock mother and myself about so cruelly, that I felt quite a relief when I was told he was dead ; but my mother, she was such a quiet, hard-working good soul, that I cannot tell you how I loved her. I never heard her complain once of father's"], [56, "42 AFXT ELIZA'S GARRET. treatment, bnt I have known her, if he were short of money, or hn<_ pawned his clothes, and wanted them oirt by such a time, to Bit np until three and four o'clock of the morning, working extra, to make op the money. For which kindness the next night might not pass before she bad been mos-t cruelly thrashed, by way of paying her for her trouble. The parish buried mother, and I went and lived with a widow woman, who was in tbe same business as ourselves. I got work from the same shop at which father had been employed, but they soon failed, and I was compelled once more to go in search of work. .Some times I got some ; very often I returned home diRi.ppoin.ed. I, at length, got some of these bibles and tracts to do, and so forth ; that is rather more constant, but horrible pay.\" \"Who are they for?\" asked Amelia '\u2022 The bibles are for a society that gives them away, or sells them next to nothing, I don't know which ; they do botb I expect.\" \" And can you make a living at the work T demanded Amelia. \" No, I cannot ; but I manage to crawl along tbe best way I can, and if I have a little help offered me I never refuse it\" \" AVhat can you make a week now T asked Amelia. \" It varies from five to eight shillings,\" was the reply. \" And do you mean to say the society that gives these bibles and tracts away pay you so badly as that ?\" a..ked Amelia. \" I do, inuY..d. It seems rather queer \u2014 don't it .' It's nut sufficient to keep one from the streets, is it f asked Susan, rather seriou -ly. \u2022 I know one or two, who, after working in the warehouse- during the day, are quite uncertain where they may sleep at night. I hope I may never come to that ; but no one can say what they may come to, and things get worse instead of better. If giving bibles, away can do so much good, I wonder we, who prepare them, arc not bett*r off . aud if it's good to give them away, it must be a better acti on in the giver if he paid a proper price for the labour which produced them ; but as father says, ' it's half mockery and jobbing, and the mechanic must suffer for it.' \" \" You speak harshly against religion,\" said Amelia. \" No, I don't,\" returned Susan, sharply ; I don't sj>eak against reli gion at all ; I would be very sorry to say a word agaiust it. If one is truly religious, I should be the last to sneer al him ; but no one can )\u00abe religions, who will unmercifully grind aud grind you down, >u.i lo humour a whim of going about giving books away, and _al__.Bg largely of religion, without one feeling of ita reality.

It's hard, indeed. for a starving person to have faith in that being who is said to feed th. sparrows, and yet who allows us to feel the gnawing gripes of hunger They call me a very wicked girl, and not deserving of the blessings Tm enjoying daily. One gentleman said, ' I should assuredly be damned.\" But how he knew that I cannot tell ; or, how one man can doom another of his fellow beings to eternal torment I do not know. But these Bible giving people have curious notions, I can tell you. It's true I was only educated at a charity school, and possibly I have no right to doubt what's told me, but I can't help it. There was one who used to come about Baldwin's Gardens that I really do believe was a good man. I have not seen him for a long time now \u2014 he may be dead for what I know. He always came when any one was in trouble. He never stopt to ask them if they were of any religion, but always commenced by trying to get matters to rights for them. He had a nice quiet way with him, and always did things in such a manner that, 'pon my word, you felt as if you were obliging him, instead of you being obliged by him. He never talked about the Biljle until you were settled, and then be would begin by littles and littles ; he, how- ever, never seemed to strive for people to become his way of thinking ; but when people began to thank him he always said, ' if I have in any way rendered you any assistance, I'll tell you how to repay me. When you meet a fellow man who wants a little help, if you can give it him, do. If you promise to do that I arn satisfied.' And away he used to go. No one knew his name, or where be came from. Some said he was a madman. He may have been, but I loved him better than I did my father, because he spoke a kind word to me, and did me a kind action ; and I say God bless him. I would say as much of the Bible givers if they had done as much as he had.\" \" You seem to possess great bitterness against these people,\" returned Amelia, \" let us hope there must be some good done.\" \"Well, I hope so, too,\" replied Susan; \"I have seen but very little of it myself. It is impossible that they can do so much good as they profess, while seven or eight in a family live in one room, sleeping altogether. Let them set about to make our circumstances better, and then possibly they may make us better. I have told 'em so, but they have only said I was a wayward girl, and that I was treated better than I deserved. If I had been brought up at a boarding school in- stead of a charity school, I suppose that would have made a difference. 1 can't humble myself, and charity children, I suppose, ought always to be very humble ; I'm therefore given over by them a3 being too bad to be reclaimed.\""], [58, "44 Aorr Eliza's garret. \" I wonder they let you have the books to stitch !\" exclaimed Amelia. \" Oh, there's nothing surprising in that. Why, \u2014 would you believe it? \u2014 there's some of the worst of men at work ou it. Some of them that machine it are horrid drunkards, and that means that they are up to the worst of crime.\" \" A man may drink, I suppose, withoat being so bad as you say,\" said Amelia. \" You hav\"n't seen what I have or you wouldn't say that,\" continued Susan. \"A man when he drinks does all kind of things ; there's no stopping him. Well, as I was saying, this Bible Society give all their work to these men, instead of giving it to those who would do it by hand. But then, don't you see, they would not save by giving it to them. If they were trades people, I shouldn't think anything about it ; but then, you see, they preach about religion and eharity, and so on; and, I think, to act as they preaoh, they might give the work to the pressmen instead of to the machine-men. And for these reasons. They have got enough money to do it ; and if they hadn't, they could easily get it. And, then, oue set of men is so much more respectable to the other ; and, besides, the pressmen begged and prayed of them to give them the work, yet they wouldn't. So, you sec, they help to keep a dass of industrious men out of work, whose wives and families, in many cases, are starving. Why, if it was only for charity, they might employ some of them ! But what's the use of talking? It's all of a piece. All your men that talks about doing so much for the poor man's benefit are the very first to grind them down ; and they always tell you, while they're doing it, that it is ' that they may have a wider space to work in.' And what does it come to after all ? Why, just this. A regular trade ; and puts money into the pockets of one or two cunning, double-faced hypocrites, while all the rest have to suffer for it. There's no good thing started, but what some cunning man puts his finger in it, and gets some pretty pickings out of it. It makes me wild to think about it.\" \u25a0 Well, I don't understand much about it myself,\" returned Amelia. \" And I hope you never may. Yon seem nice and comfortable here, now ; but if work should fail, and you should be obliged to part with everything you have, little by little ; if you should come to want a crost, and wander from shop to shop for work, and be refused at every one, returning home tired, foot-sore, cold and hungry ; if, then, you're tempted to acts that stamp you as a degraded wretch, I fancy you mustbeso-Bething more than human if you resist it. I have known those who have made great professions in prosperity, but when they ecme to suffer have been the first to fall. There's a wonderful difference between an empty and a full stomach, I can tell you. Well, I have"], [59, "aunt eliza'b garret. 45 finished now, and must hurry home with these goods. For the present I must leave you.\" \" You must come agoin when I'm alone,\" returned Amelia, \"we shall be company for each other ; and even Aunt, I dare say, will be glad to see and talk to you. It will be a change to her as well as to myself.\" \"Well, we shall see,\" returned Susan. \"Goodbye.\" And with a light step she left the room. When she had gone, Amelia could not help pandering over her words. \" If work should fail ;\" and it might, thought Amelia. Sup pose her Aunt, or George, or Joey, or herself, were to become ill, how could they live? What were those acts that Susan hinted at? Could it be possible that she could sink so low as to pawu another's goods and become a thief? He- ideas did not allow her to imagine anything beyond. She was dull and wretched ; and as each thought came coursing through her brain, her fingers plied the needle with the rapidity of lightning: as if, by doing so, she could avert whatever evil might be hanging over their heads, \u2014 she thought not of herself alone. CHAPTER VII. \" Aunt, do you know, I fancy our landlady has succeeded in letting her parlour on the ground floor,\" exclaimed Amelia, as she and her Aunt were sitting at breakfast, about a week after Aunt Eliza's enter ing the employ of Mr. Jones. \" Indeed ! what makes you think so?\" asked Aunt Eliza. \" Because I saw a new face enter last night, and go into that room \" replied Amelia. \" Well, I suppose it will not make any difference to us, though I certainly do not like living in a house where there are so many fami lies ; but one must get use to that sort of thing,\" returned Aunt Eliza. \" Have you done up your work ready for me to take with me ?\" \" Yes,\" returned Amelia. \" I hope it is all right ; for if there is only a single stitch wrong, and he sees it, I shall never hear the last of it; saying nothing about what he'll deduot. You see there were four shillings last week, and he is just as likely to serve me the same trick this.\" \" I would not stay then, if I were you, because that's cheating. If he"], [60, "aunt eliza's garret. 46 only means to pay you sixteen, why don't he say so, and not for every frivolous fault make a deduction.\" \" I should have left last Saturday,\" returned Aunt Eliza, \" but our new acquaintance, Susan, has rather alarmed me as to the prospect of getting work that is likely to pay us. I should not like to give it up until I was sure of something.\" \" Well, you know best,\" continued Amelia, \" I only hope that you will get used to the old Welch monster, and so make the situation fighter to you. Good bye.\" \"Goodbye, dear. You won't forget to give Joey his medicine ; I don't think he is so well to-day. Poor little fellow, I wish I could always be with you.\" And then stooping down she kissed him ; and with a tear just starting from her eyes, she caught the work in her arm, and hurried from the room. Her hand was already on the latch of the street door when the door of the parlour opened, and the lady who had applied to Jones for the situation of forewoman stood beside her. Aunt Eliza for the moment felt stupified. \" Good morning, ma'am,\" exclaimed the individual alluded to. \" Good morning,\" returned Aunt Eliza, \" I think we have met before, have we not ?\" \" It's very possible, but I cannot recall to mind where,\" was the reply. \"You applied, I think, to Mr. Jones for the situation of forewoman, did you not?\" asked Aunt Eliza. \" Oh, yes, certainly.\" \" I was in the shop during the interview,\" replied Aunt Eliza. \" I was the party to whom he alluded when he said he was engaged.\" \" Indeed !\" replied Miss Johnson, for such she called herself. \" And what sort of a plaee is it ? rather hard I should think.\" \" It is very hard,\" replied Aunt Eliza. \" I thought so.\" u Why, what made you think so T \" Because he was so remarkably civil and condescending,\" replied Miss Johnson. \"AVhen a man is like that to a new face, he is gene rally sharp and severe to his hands. Give me the man who cuts you off when you first go to him ; you can soften him, but the other you can't.\" \" I think you are right, but you must excuse my staying longer, I am in a great hurry. To-morrow is Sunday ; if you are not engaged, suppose you step up and have a cup of tea with us.\" \" I have an engagement in the evening, after tea,\" returned Miss Johnson, \"but if you will permit me, I will do myself the pleasure of joining you at the tea-table, though I must leave shortly afterwards.\""], [61, "acst eliza's garret. 47 \" Very well, then, let it be so,\" returned Aunt Eliza. They then separated, and proceeded about each other's business ; and as Aunt Eliza made her way through the different streets, she muttered to herself, \"well, if I am to work for a living, I may as well make ac quaintance with those who work also ; by so doing, I may learn something from them. It puzzles me how Susan lives, and it really is as great a puzzle to me how this Miss Johnson can keep up such a respectable appearance. There must be some trick in trade some where. I've heard dear Joseph say, there was more done by scheming and method than hard work. I believe it, too, for I work hard enough now, and the harder I work the less I seem to please, and the less I get.\" By the time Aunt Eliza had arrived at this point of her reflections, she had also arrived at the shop-door of Mr. Jones. The clock of Cripplegate church was striking tlw hour of eight when she entered. The day passed and nine o'clock at night had arrived. Aunt Eliza, tired and exhausted, began to pack up her work preparatory to her departing for the evening. \" Now, then, what are you doing there?\" demanded Jones. \" Packing up,\" returned Aunt Eliza, \" it is past nine.' \"So it may be,\" retorted Jones, \"but my work is not done yet; You must stop until it is, if it's twelve o'clock.\" \"It's Saturday night,\" returned Aunt Eliza, \"there will be no work to go in to-morrow.\" \" But I must have it done, and there's an end of it,\" exclaimed Jones So Aunt Eliza and the other hands returned to their work, and con tinued at it until about eleven, when Jones again came into the room. \" AVell, Pratt, how does it stand now ?\" \" There's full three hours work yet,\" she replied. \"Well, I can't have you working here of a Sunday, so you had better fold up, and then come down and I'll pay. Look sharp now, or some of you will go short, for I shan't pay one of you after the clock has struck twelve. I don't approve of Sunday work.\" So saying, he left the room, and in a few minutes the work was all doubled up, and each hand was anxiously waiting to be paid. Aunt Eliza was the last. \" AVell, Pratt,\" exclaimed Jones, \" there's three shillings to come off you.\" \" AVhat for ?\" she demanded, sharply \" For allowing bad work to be done.\" \" I can't help that,\" she retorted, \" I can't make bad hands good ones. Employ proper hands, and pay them properly, you will then get your work done properly.\""], [62, "48 AUNT ELIZA'S OAMtET. \" I engaged you to look after them,\" returned Jones. \u00ab* And I do. No one works harder than I do. I'm here at eight in the morning, aud I have not left one night this week before twelve, and sometimes two, and now you want to take three shillings off what you engaged to pay mo. Of the two I should have thought you ought to have added, not deducted.\" \" I can't help what you think ; there's your money, seventeen shil lings,\" returned Jones. \" I want twenty,\" was Aunt Eliza's reply. \" And you're likely to want ; you won't get it from me.\" \"And you're likely to want my help on Monday, I'm thinking,\" re turned Aunt Eliza, taking up the money. \"You won't catch me having another week at it, I can tell you ; and another thing, I shall see whether a magistrate won't make you pay me the difference.\" \" It's twelve o'clock,\" returned Jones, \" I cannot attend to you now ; if you have anything further to say to me, come on Monday.\" So saying, he left the room ; and Aunt Eliza returned home, crying with vexation, yet hoping that Monday morning would see her more profitably employed. CHAPTER VIII. Bt the time Aunt Eliza had arrived home she was somewhat calmei than she was when she left the warehouse. Little Joey was lying asleep in a bed made up on two chairs, which were standing in a little corner close by the fire-place. Amelia was sitting by his side, tired and sleepy, wondering what could keep her Aunt so late. On a Saturday night, too, of all nights in the week, she surely might be spared a little earlier. \"Well, dear, here I am,\" exdaimed Aunt Eliza, as she entered, \" and almost dead.\" \" You cannot mean that you have been kept at work until now !\" ejaculated Amelia. \" And where's George ?\" \" I have not seen him. Is he out V \" Yes. He sat here waiting and waiting, wondering why you did not come, until he lost all patience ; he then took up his hat, and said he would go and see whatever was the matter, for I could not persnade him that some accident had not happened to you. He said, if you were on the way home, he would be sure to see you. I suppose he will be here directly.\""], [63, "aunt Eliza's garret. 49 \" I have left,\" continued Aunt Eliza. \" I thought you would,\" returned Amelia. \" Has he made another deduction '!\" \"Yes, three shillings, and kept us all there until the very last mo ment. He has an idea he is a very religious man, and so he would not permit us to work after the clock had gone twelve, because that would be breaking the sabbath.\" \" I should like to know,\" returned Amelia, \" how he would like to be ground down in the way he grinds his hands down ; I wonder if there's anything Christian in that. Besides, if he don't break the Sabbath, all his hands must. How can they go marketing at this hour? Of course they must leave it till the morning. I half fancy that there's a great deal of truth in some of Susan's remarks. Ah ! here comes George.\" \" Holloa, Aunt !\" exclaimed George, as he entered the room, \"what on earth has made you so late? You don't mean to say that that old Welch goat has been keeping you there until this time of the morning ?\" \" Yes, I do, George, but it's the last time.\" \" Well, that's right,\" returned George, \" I'm glad to hear you say that ; you're getting as thin and pale as a ghost. I'm sure there's other work to be got better than that ; so the sooner you have something to eat and toddle to bed, the better : and mind, you remain in bed in the morning, and tak. plenty of rest, for it's Sunday. Thank goodness for that.\" \"Ah, George, if religion gave us nothing else but that,'' replied Aunt Eliza, \" we should have much to be thankful for. It's a luxury the rich cannot enjoy, but to us poor slaves, it is one beyond all price.\" Supper over, they each sought their bed, to forget in sleep the trials and vexations that had chased them through the day. Aunt Eliza had scarcely appeared to have dropped oft to sleep, when she was aroused by a tapping at the door of the room in which George was sleeping. \"Dear me,\" she thought to herself, \" is it morning already. I have scarcely had any sleep.\" And turning over on her pillow, she once more invited the drowsy god. The tapping was again renewed, and George, at length, was aroused from his slumbers. \u2022 Wait a moment, I'll be up directly,\" cried out George, thinking it was his sister waiting to get the breakfast. He was not long in putting on his morning toilette and opening the door ; when, to his astonishment, he discovered a short, thin, little man, dressed in black, and so carefully brushed that not a particle of dust could be funnel on"], [64, "50 aunt eliza's garret. him. His hat possessed a low crown and very broad brim ; his shirt Was plain but beautifully white, in the centre of which was placed a large, old-fashioned brooch, the only heir-loom, possibly, belonging to his family; round his neck he wore a white neckerchief, that had the appearance of a broad, white rope, instead of what it really was. He wore uo collar, whilst his hair was brushed straight across the sore head, from right to left, and so low as to reach his eye-brows ; his cheeks had a bluish tinge, the effect of his continually shaving off his whiskers, and not allowing a single hair to adorn his face; under his arm he carried a book, about the size of a demy quarto, from between the gilt edged leaves of which came peeping forth little strips of blue and red silk ribbon ; his hands were gloveless, and looked coarse and dirty ; his trousers were about three sizes too large for him, and to counteract the inconvenience occasioned by their slipping down under his heels, they were carefully turned up an inch or two, displaying the buttons which the tailor iu his generosity had put for the purpose of appending straps, but which were totally unnecessary in the present case ; he wore low shoes, which were tied by two large bows of black tape \u2014 ribbon possibly, would have shown a disposition harping too much after the good things of this world \u2014 and had had their proper share of Day and Martin. \" Did you knock at this door, sir ?\" asked George, in surprise. \" Yea, verily, friend, I did knock at that door, with the Lord's help,\" returned the little man, at the same time pushing his way into the room. AAlien he had reached about the centre be stood still, aud stared first at George, then at the bed ; from the bed his eyes wandered to the fire-place, from thence round the room, and then back again to George ; and after looking him very hard in the face, he gradually dropt his eyes until they reached George's feet, from whence they rose in the same slow degree that they had fallen, and finally got into that position in which a full and commanding view of the ceiling could be obtained ; he then placed his hands together, and exclaimed. \u2014 \u2022'Lord, these people have much to thank thee for.\" Having given utterance to this, he condescended to bring his eyes into such a range that they could take George in. He then continued \" young man \u2014 .\" \" Well,\" returned George, rather sharply. \"Young man,\" continued the little man, \"it is not seemly in you to answer me in that churlish manner; but wherefore should I complain, wheu it pleased our dear Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, when in the flesh, to suffer insult and contoomly ? (contumely.) I should rather rejoice at it than complain. Young man \u2014 .\""], [65, "AUNT ELIZAS GARRET. 51 \" AVell,\" returned George, once more. \" Where is the rest of thy people ?\" \" What people do you mean ?\" asked George. \" The inhabitants of these apartments,\" returned the little man, \"If you mean my aunt and sister,\" exclaimed George, \"they are not up yet.\" \" Did my tears 'ear Aarigbt ?\" exclaimed the little man, in a state of well -assumed horror. \" Not yet risen !\" \" And may I ask,\" continued George, \" what business it is of yours whether they are up or not?\" \" Young man, it pleaseth me much to hear thee ask that question. It shows that thou hast an enquiriug mind, and by the blessing of the Lord, it will turn to thine everlasting advantage. Verily, young man, I have been called to be a missionary at home ; and by God's help, I have spread amongst hundreds of my fellow men and women the news that the Son of Man suffered on the cross ; that we, having faith, might in herit the kingdom of Heaven, through all eternity. In that vocation I have called upon thee in my rounds. I have heard that thou wert newly arrived in the neighbourhood, and I could not rest until I had set thy feet in the right path. But here cometh the woman of the house.\" And as he spoke Aunt Eliza entered. She had been disturbed by the conversation, and anxious to know what could be the meaning of a man's voice in her apartment, she had hastily thrown on her things to come and see for herself. \" AVhat is it, George ?\" she asked, as she saw that he could scarcely refrain from laughing. \" Verily woman, it is seemly to ask that question. How wilt thou answer it when it is put by thy conscience when thou shalt stand at the judgment seat of Christ? Methink3 that thou hast been guilty of great neglect. It is now close upon the third hour and I find thee but newly risen.\" \" It may be late,\" returned Aunt Eliza, \" I was not at home until past twelve.\" \" Not home until past the midnight hour !\" exclaimed the little man, \" It cannot be that thou wert engaged in a proper calling at that hour. Oh, if thou didst visit the theayter, remember, I charge thee that thou art running in the very mouth of the devil.\" \"Oh, you need not trouble yourself about that,\" returned Aunt Eliza. \" I was too busily engaged at work, and too poorly paid, to go to any place of amusement.\" \" I am rejoiced to hear thee say that, if thou wert working to save thy breaking the Lord's annointed day.\""], [66, "52 AUNT ELIZA'S GARRET. \" No I was not, and what's more, I have much to do to-day. I have to go out aud purchase my dinner, and many other little things, aud then to cook it afterwards.\" \" Woman !\" exclaimed the little man, in a voice of authority, \" dost thou not know that thou art on the high road to the devil ? Woman, I say unto thee, thou art seeking damnation ! It is truly said that Satan finds some mischief still for ftidle 'ands to do. Thou art lazily inclined ; instead of having risen from thy bed some three hours since, as I have, studying the ever refreshing word of the gospel, or wandering through the streets, giving unto thy fellow sojourners in this vale of tears, tracts and such like food for the mind, thou art planning how to pamper thy /.appetite, and to buy, if not to sell, on this most holy day. AA'oman, I say unto thee, thy soul is in a wretched state ! It has pleased the Lord, I perceive by that cap of woe, to chasten thee, to take from thee the well-beloved partner of thy bussum.\" Here Aunt Eliza burst into tears, whereupon the little man, fancying be had made an impression, continued : \u2014 \" But behind the cloud he hides a smiling face. He had some good /\u2022.object in view when it pleased him to so afflict thee, It may be you were called to watch for weeks beside a sick mau's bed ; it may be that thou wert called to see the loved one of thy youth cut suddenly off in the prime of life, and in the tcery flower of his sins. It may be that it will please him to call thee through many tribulations to make thee at last his own. I pray God it may be so. I will read to thee a chapter, and then pray with thee.\" \"You will do no such thing!\" exclaimed Amelia, who, during his address, had entered unperceived, \" at least, not if I can help it.\" \" Young woman ! knowest thou to who you speak ?\" \" To an ignorant fool.

George, don't talk like that.

Remember, George, what uncle used to say : \u2014 ' If you would be truly religious, learn to feel the pangs that exist within another's breast, so shall you learn to be thankful for the good you enjoy, so shall you learn to render to the needy what help may be in your power, without opening the wound from which their pain emanates.' \" CHAPTER IX. ExACTLt at half-past three Miss Johnson knocked at the door of Aunt Eliza's rooms, and was forthwith admitted with all the ceremony usual upon a first visit. There was still the same style of dress, only of more value than that which she had worn on the occasion when Aunt Eliza. saw her first. George was quite fascinated with her appearance, and mentally exclaimed, as she entered, \" my eye, what a stunner !\" Sha seemed, however, to have paid some very great attention to her toilet, as if for the purpose of making a conquest. Perhaps she had had some thoughts of the kind when she was dressing ; if so, it was rather ex cusable, if we take her word as being the truth, for the reader will"], [72, "56 aunt eliza's garret. remember, that she said she was upwards of thirty, and all ladies are anxious about that time of life, lest they should sink into the grave at last with the horrible appellation \" old maid\" attached to their name. There was a vast difference between Amelia and Miss Johnson. The former was of a retiring disposition, yet bold and energetic when actually necessary, but withal modest. Her dress was neat and simple mourning ; her complexion fair ; her eyes were blue, soft and expressive ; her forehead high and broad, though the nose spoilt the beautiful symmetry of the face, for it was too large in proportion to the rest. Tbe latter was a pretty woman, bcld and cunning ; idle, yet depending upon her own exertions for a living; fond of dress and admiration ; fearful of her age and ready to snap at any offer that might be made her. She had, too, on the present occasion, thrown on one side the tightly-fitting bodice, and had put on one that opened down the front, giving place to a thin, embroidered chemisette ; and round her really beautifully-formed throat was gracefully entwined a gold chain, which, reaching down to her waist, was there fastened to a small Geneva gold watch, whilst her fingers were liberally bedecked with rings of moderate value. \"Well,\" thought George, after the introductions had been gone hrough, and the usual remarks on the weather had been made, \" it's well to be a needle-woman if it can support this '.\" \"How do you and your friend, Mr. Jones, agree?\" asked Mis. Johnson, addressing herself to Aunt Eliza. \" Oh ! we parted last night,\" returned Aunt Eliza, at the same time fully explaining to her all that occurred at Mr. Jones's, and her deter mination to seek work elsewhere in the morning. \" You have an engagement, I presume.\" \" Oh, yes,\" returned Miss Johnson, \" I succeeded in obtaining it the same day that you went to Jones's. It is at a shop on Islington Green, as forewoman.\" \" Indeed !\" exclaimed Aunt Eliza. \" Yes ; but it is not in the embroidery branch,\" was Miss Johnson's reply. \" Indeed '.\" \" No ; it is in ladies' linen apparel and baby linen,\" returned Miss Johnson. \" Is that better than embroidery ?\" asked Amelia. \" No, miss, not to the hands.\" \" I suppose it is only common neeedle-work ? asked Aunt Eliza. \" Yes, most of it is, there's a great deal of very line stitching in the things,\" returned Miss Johnson."], [73, "aunt ct.tza's garret. 57 ** And what do they pay ?\" asked Amelia. \" Why, for ladies' night dresses we pay five shillings a dozen, and it takes a very good hand fifteen hours to make one of them. Fifteen hours, you know is the proper day for a needle-woman.\" \" Why, that's only five-pence for fifteen hours' work !\" exclaimed George, in surprise ; \" not a halfpenny an hour.\" \" That's true,\" returned Miss Johnson, \"and they can't slim their work, I can tell you ; for the proprietor will take them as they come in, and pull every seam as hard as possible, to see if they open in the least ; and if they do, they are handed back to be unpicked and re-sown. I have .een him actually grit his teeth together as he has pulled at the seams.\" \" I have certainly heard,\" continued Aunt Eliza, \" of women working en men's slop shirts at four-pence each.\" \" Ah, that's good pay,\" exclaimed Miss Johnson, interruptingly, \" to what these night dresses are ; you may have a chance to put light work into them, and so do more of them, but these night dresses beat all I ever did come across. They have to find their own cotton, you know.\" \" Find their own cotton !\" exclaimed George, in surprise. \" Well, that beats cock fighting.\" \"George!\" exclaimed Amelia, giving him a very peculiar look, ** your friends at the counting-house, I fancy, do not improve your conversational powers.\" \" Ah, well, never mind, Meeley ! I'll take a few lessons of old Quizby, and then I shall come out stunning. I've already commenced reading tbe Family Herald and the London Journal, and that'll add both style and elegance. I fancy I just shall cut a shine. Don't you think so, Miss Johnson ?\" \" Your conversational powers, I should fancy from the slight know ledge I have of you, are by no means small, and aided by study, I hav_ no doubt but your talents will be of no mean order.\" \"'Pon my word you do me proud,\" returned George, colouring slightly, and hardly knowing whether it was meant for a compliment or merely as a sarcastic remark. \" It strikes me,\" exclaimed Aunt Eliza, addressing herself to Miss Johnson, \" that you must have been rather fortunate in respect of work ; you are evidently in a comfortable position. You will excuse me making the remark, but I'm anxious to obtain all the information that I can, and shall feel greatly obliged if you can give me any hints that would be of benefit to me.\" \" Exactly so,\" replied Miss Johnson ; \"and I'm sure nothing would give me greater pleasure than in my being able to render any one as-"], [74, "58 ATOT ELIZA '\u00bb GARRET. sistance, but I'm very fearful whether I cau do so. You sec, tbe great feature in gettiDg easy situations, of which there are but very few, is in humouring the men of the establishment. You must have no feelings of refinement, and however insulting they may be, it's always better to take no notice of the insult, but go on as if nothing whatever had occured. It requires judgment, though, in atting like that. Some men like you all the better if you can use your tongue a little. Some of them are exceedingly gay, and have an idea that all workwomen are no better than they should be. It is very annoying to he subji\u00c6l to their remarks, but if you wish to make friends with them, and make your work run light, you must, however sad you may feel, laugh and joke with them. To some you must appear mightily modest and reli- gious ; to another, good-tempered and ladylike ; to another, their coun- terpart in every respect. This will make you liked. Then your great care must be to let all your work be done well ; and if you are fore- woman, be as strict as ever you can, letting nono of the hands, if possible, speak to your employer. Then, if at any time you want a little help in the shape of a small loan, if you mind how you manage your cards; yon may be able to get it ; and as regards dress, you may- get presents of waste pieces, and so forth, that, with a little care, you may manage to make a respectable appearance. Some of the men have no taste or style whatever about their things and patterns, and look to you to supply it ; you must, therefore, always have your eyes open. Some of your girls will invariably have good taste, and so forth. Promise her plenty of work if she can bring yon in a new pattern, a new style of cap, or anything new in which you find your employers deal. Then take it to your own room, make some slight alteration to it, taking care not to damage the effect, and then present it, praising it well, and passing it off as your own. Your hold upon the situation becomes more firm every day, and you begin to be looked upon as a perfect angel. The man by whom I am at present employed Is a very eccentric man indeed ; and although I have been with him only s fortnight, I have succeeded in inducing him to bring out two new styles of caps and a baby's robe. He was mightily pleased with them ; and, singularly enough, the first half-dozen of the caps had not been in the shop more than a couple of hours before they had been sold. All this tended to put me in favour. The next morning I happened to be absent a quarter of an hour behind my time. When I entered, he did not forget to tell me of it in pretty round terms. I said nothing to him, but took off my bonnet and smoothed down my hair. This an noyed him very much indeed, and shutting his fist, he struck the counter a very heavy blow, crying out at the same time, ' speak, why"], [75, "aunt eliza's garret. 59 don't you speak ? I shall bust if you don't.\" I burst out a laughing, and looking as good humoured as I could at him, I said, \u2014 ' when you are a good little boy, aud quite out of that naughty temper, I'll talk to you, yes, I will.* It was a bold stroke, but, said with a good hu moured look which he could not resist ; and so bursting into a laugh, he left the shop. The next morning, however, I took good care to be early. It was about five minutes before the hour, and I was standing looking in the window, thinking how I could alter some of the things to make it appear to better advantage. He happened to see me, so opening the door, he put his head out and said, \u2014 ' what ' are you waiting till the clock strikes ?' ' Yes, to be sure,' I answered. And there I stood until it did strike, whilst he was peeping at rue, grinning and rubbing his hands, as if it were the best joke in theworld.\" \" It must be rather difficult,\" exclaimed Aunt Eliza, \" to so adapt oneself to the different people you may meet, \u2014 to say nothing of your wounded feelings.\" \" Mrs. Pratt, workwomen must have no feelings. Once show that you have feelings or affections, and you will be imposed upon most unmercifully,\" replied Miss Johnson. \" It requires a little patience at first, but you soon get used to it.\" \"You said that some would give you a locu. Is it possible there can be so much generosity ?\" asked Aunt Eliza. \" Oh, yes, they will do that to their forewomen sometimes ; I have had several.\" \" Of course you had to give security.\" \"Oh, not at all ; not even an I. 0. D. as they call it. They know pretty Weil it is never your intention to pay them bock again, and they fancy by just obliging you like, that they will get you more in their power, and so obtain their secret wishes the more readily. You cer tainly lay yourself open, but you must manage your cards the best way you can.\" \" Dear me, it's very dreadful !\" exclaimed Aunt Eliza. \" I've got a very bright prospect before me, certainly. I'm sure I can never hide my feelings, or joke with the men.\" \" Ah, you must not be down-hearted,\" replied Miss Johnson. \" You must go into a work-room where there is about twenty or thirty girls at work in the room, mix with them, and work with them for a short time, and you will very soon have the fine polish taken off your feelings ; you will learn there to be able to give utterance to a joke without blushing, and that's a great way towards hardening one's feelings.\" \" But that's very horrible !\" returned Aunt Eliza. 44 When a woman has to work by her needle for her living, Mrs."], [76, "60 auht emza's garret. I Pratt,\" returned Miss Johnson, \"directly she has gone Into aware house, she has lost caste. It Is a dreadful thing, certainly, but it is nevertheless true. It is merely looked upon as a cloak for other affairs; aud shops are frequently the market where fine figures and pretty looks are used as the loadstone that shall draw customers. It would not pay, therefore, if the people so employed should be possessed of tbe same fine feelings as ladies who have their carriages.\" \" Oh, dear, whatever shall we do !\" exclaimed Aunt Eliza, addressing herself to Amelia. \"I really have no idea,\" she replied ; \"but if it is our lot to work, why, we must do the best we can ; and if a chance occure, to get ont of it as soon as possible.\" \" Bravely said !\" continued Miss Johnson. \" You are already stamped as a needle-woman ; make your mind up to its worst consequences, and let your only thought be how to get the most out of the men.\" \" Well, I must do that or starve,\" returned Aunt Eliza. \" We have 4 no money now but what we earn, and whether I thall get work to morrow or not is all a chance.\" \" You must not allow yourself to become duIL Always keep up your spirits, everything depends on that. I think I can recommend you to a party for the present, uutil something turns up. She is a riend of mine, and married a hatter in Newgate Street. They carry on the business of drawn bonnet makers. She is in want of a hand to run the casings. You could soon get into the way of doing that, and in the mean time looking out for a forewoman's place. She and I used to work in the same warehouse. She picked her husband up at Rosherville. She was as poor as any of the needle-women, but a capital hand. Her husband thought if he married her he would make sure of a good hand, and one that would look aster his interests ; so he added her business to his, and a capital thing they are doing of it. If you like to go there to-morrow, I'll give you a note to her, and I know she will give you work if you can sooa get into the way of doing it.\" \" Well, I'll try, and I shall be obliged to you for your kindness.\" \" Oh, not at all,\" continued Miss Johnson, \"we all help one another when it don't take anything out of our pockets, we get the name of being good-natured then. I must now go and \u2022 dress, for I have an appointment as I told you. I'll write the note, and send it you up.\" \" Thank you, you are very kind,\" exclaimed Aunt Eliza. \" Oh, don't mention it.

So, good bye, dear, and mind and keep up your"], [77, "I ACNT ELIZA'S GARRET. spirits.\" Then shaking hands with Amelia and Aunt Eliza, and, of course, kissing them both, she slightly bowed to George, and then left the room. In about half-an-bour afterwards Miss Johnson, carefully attired, left the house, having first sent up a note addressed to Mrs. Jennings, drawn bonnet maker, Newgate Street CHAPTER X. As soon as Miss Johnson had lest her residence, she stepped into a Paddington omnibus, and rode as far as the Eagle Tavern in the City Road, where she alighted. \" Half-past seven,\" she soliloquised as she glanced at her Geneva watch, \" and he made the appointment for seven. I wonder if he has grown impatient and gone away. I will, however, wait here a few moments ; he may possibly have gone in, and will come out again presently.\" She, therefore, lowered her veil, and commenced a slow promenade up and down before the entrance to the tavern. Whilst she was thus engaged, our old friend, Snblimus Quizby, came out of the tavern, smoking a cigar. As he stood upon the step he drew himself up to his fullest height, and giving two or three tugs at his waistcoat, and the same number of \" ahems !\" he began to look leisurely around him. Presently his eyes fell upon the figure of Miss Johnson, and having convinced himself that he was not mistaken, ho exclaimed : \u2014 \" Ah, by Jupe\u00abtofc ! I am not wrong. It is the very lady herself ; and, now then, for a little enjoyment. That was not a bad idea of mine to get Mrs. Quizby into that tobacconist and stationer's shop, \u2014 it keep3 her in doors of a Sunday, and puts money into my pocket. I never did a better thing in my life. My friend, the Mayor of Southampton, could not have managed it better himself. None of my tricks in the Isle of Wight are equal to it \u2014 it is famous.\" By the time he had finished his soliloquy, he and Miss Johnson were shaking hands with ail the cordiality of old friends. \" Good evening, miss,\" exclaimed Quizby, \" I had given you up.\" \" I am rather late,\" returned Miss Johnson, putting her arm through Quizby's. \" It was unavoidable. A young friend called on me that I had not seen for some time, and she detained me beyond the hour appointed.\" \"I would that you could continue to make excuses,\" exclaimed"], [78, "62 aunt eliza's oarrft. Quizby, \"for you have such a delightful winning way with you, that it's quite pleasing to hear you make them. Will you step into the grounds ?\" \"Oh, sir!\" exclaimed Miss Johnson, \"I'm fearful that that would not be very prudent.\" \"What makes you think so?\" asked Quizby, giving the young lady k gentle squeeze of the hand. \" It is not right, is it, for young ladies to be seen there T' said Miss Johnson, in a gentle voice. \" Ob, there can be nothing wrong in it, I assure you,\" returned Quizby, drawing his cigar from his mouth ; \"besides you must feel tired and require some refreshment. So, without any further persuasion, Sublimus took the fair creature towards the door, obtained a ticket, and passed in. \" Now,\" said Quizby, \" we shall be able to hold more social converse one with the other. Waiter, bring hither some refreshment, if you please. Pray be seated, miss.\" Without a second invitation, Miss Johnson sat down in one of the darkest arbours \u2014 none of them are very light \u2014 that abound in the so called gardens of the Eagle Tavern. \"Waiter !\" shouted Quizby again. 41 Yes'er.\" \" Bring hither some refreshment, if you please.\" * 'Freshment, sir, \u2014 yes 'er. AVhat 'freshment, sir !*\u2022 \" AVhat would you like to partake of, miss ?\" demanded Quizby, his eyes looking as if they were ready to bolt out of his head, and his mouth drawn into a contortion, which he meant for a smile ; indeed, he fancied he was looking most alarmingly wicked, and acting the fast young man to perfection. \" I am not particular,\" returned Miss Johnson, \" but I would rather not have anything.\" \" Oh, pooh, pooh ! that's rubbish yon know ; you must have some thing. Have a drop of gin and water?\" \" I never drink spirits,\" returned Miss Johnson, rather austerely. 44 1 am surprised, sir, at your proposing such a thing. If I have any thing at all it must be a little wine.\" Quizby\"s face varied very much in its expression. He was very fond cf his money ; aud Mrs. Quizby had also a whiro of occ a.ionally exa mining his pockets when he had gone to bed. He had, however, since having, for the second time in life, gone into business (though he still retained his situation,) taken the exchequer department under his own control."], [79, "aunt eliza's garret. 63 \"In fact,\" continued Miss Johnson, \"I never drink anything but sherry, and unless I can have that, I prefer going without.\" \"Sherry, how very singular!\" exclaimed Quizby, \"I'm very partial to that wine myself. Waiter ! bring bather a pint of sherry.\" \" And let it be of the best quality,\" added Miss Johnson. And then turning to Quizby, she continued, \" I think nothing is so odious to the taste as bad sherry.\" \" I perfectly agree with you. In fact, whatever those ruby lips of thine give utterance to, must be correct ;\" exclaimed Sublimus, at the same time placing his arm round the waist of the young lady, and attempting to steal a kiss. \" Oh, fie ! Mr. Stedman,\" exclaimed Miss Johnson. \" If you do not behave yourself better, I shall be obliged to leave yon.\" \"Why call me Mr. Stedman?\" continued Sublimus, who, notwith standing the admonition he had received, had succeeded in tasting the perfume of her lips. \" Why not call me Charles \u2014 dear Charles ?\" \" I have known you such a short time,\" returned Miss Johnson. \"But why say Mr. Stedman? it is so cold,\" exclaimed Sublimus, again attempting to look captivating. \" It is the name you taught me to call you,\" returned Miss Johnson. \" Pint o' sherry, sir.\" \" That's right. What's the damage ?\" demanded Sublimus, drawing out his purse, which was stocked at one end with about half a dozen sovereigns, one week's receipt of the tobacconist shop. \"Three and six, sir.'' 41 AVhat !\" exclaimed Sublimus. \" Three and six, sir. Pint o' sherry you ordered, sir.\" \"I know I did ; but that's an enormous price as the market goes,\" returned Sublimus. \" You asked for the best quality, sir. We have an inferior quality at half-a-crown.\" \u2666'Well, never mind, give me change for a sovereign, if you please,\" exclaimed Sublimus, putting a bold face on the matter. \" Change for a sovereign, sir ; yes'er. Four, five, ten, fifteen, se venteen and six, and two's nineteen and six. You hav'n't got such a thing as sixpence ?\" \"No, I have not.\" \" Here, Joe, give us two sixpences for a shilling. That's it, nine teen and six, sir, and six-pence makes twenty,\" continued the waiter, putting down on the table a fourpenny piece and two-pence. 44 Thank you,\" returned Sublimus, \" that is right.\""], [80, "aunt eliza's garret. 64 \" Please to remember the waiter, sir. We have nothing, sir, only what we makes.\" 41 Indeed !\" exclaimed Sublimus, trying to look very liberal, \" there's a penny.\" 41 Thank yon, sir, much obleged,\" and the waiter vanished. \" Now, then, my dearest love,\" continued Sublimus, pouring out the sherry, \" allow me to pledge thee in this goblet of rosy wine.\" And as he finished speaking, he handed to Miss Johnson a glassful of tho sherry that, in his heart, he was regretting he had ordered. \"Thank you,\" returned Miss Johnson as she took the preferred glass and slightly sipped of its contents. Sublimus, however, did not admire such small potations, and, as he had paid for it, he determined to have the best of It. His draughts were, therefore, pretty frequent. As he was thus regaling himself, and talking what he called poetry to Miss Johnson, that lady's thoughts ran something like the following. \"The stupid, mean old fool, as if it were likely a woman could love him. I am not going to put up with much of his nonsense. Some paltry clerk I suppose. I am not come to that yet, to be entirely depending ou his good word. He's made me give up the chance of meeting a really nice young fellow ; if I don't make him suffer for it, my name's not Charlotte Johnson, that's all.\" [Aloud.'] \" Allow me to fill your glass, dear Charles,\" slightly tremulous on the two last words. \" Thank you, my love, my charmer, my angel !\" exclaimed Sublimus, giving her hand another squeeze. \" The selfish old pig !\" continued Miss Johnson, meditatively. \"I wonder what his ideas of our sex are. He is at any rate selfishly las civious ; all men are that drink for the sake of drinking, and he is worse than any I have known. He's dreadfully selfish., and horribly mean ; and yet he would like to possess all a woman's love and give nothing for it. I'll make him suffer. I wonder if he's got a wife. I dare say he has ; or why did he keep looking about him as if he felt afraid of meeting some one he did not want to see ?\" [Aloud.] \" Come, dear Charles, you don't drink your wine, it is of an excellent quality.\" \" It is charming, but nothing to be compared to the sweetness of thy lips,\" returned Sublimus, upon whose head the wine was beginning to tell, whilst his eyes seemed to be continually increasing in size. \" Heigho !\" sighed Miss Johnson. \" Prithee, wherefore that sigh ?\" demanded Sublimus. 44 It came involuntarily, Mr. Stedman.\""], [81, "aunt eliza's carbet. 65 44 Why that odious Mr.?\" exclaimed Sublimus. \" Well, then, Charles, dear Charles,\" returned Miss Johnson, looking very lovingly in his face ; then, casting her eyes downwards with a sad expression, she murmured, \" but wherefore should I say that ? 'tis only building bright hopes merely that they may be wasted away by the ugonizing breeze of neglect.'' \" Ahem !\" exclaimed Sublimus, pulling at his waistcoat, \" wherefore, my loved one, that sad tone and melancholy expression ?\" 44 Ah! wherefore?\" continued Miss Johnson, imitating as near as possible, without its being too palpable, Sublimus's sentimentality, \" wherefore should I pour into another's breast the woe that racks my own?\" and opening the small pocket in her dress, she drew out her handkerchief and placed it to her eyes. \" Nay,\" continued Sublimus, finishing his glass, \" hesitate not, but confide thy troubles to me.\" \" To be spurned from you as a thing to be hated !\" sobbed Miss Johnson. \" That can never be, so long as you remain .' \" Permit me to replenish your glass. It is wrong in me to make you wretched with my troubles. It is nothing ; there, it's over now.\" And having given utterance to this sentence in a somewhat theatrical style, she handed him his glass. Sublimus, of course, drank the wine, and when he put the glass from his hand, he found Miss Johnson's face buried in her handkerchief, and resting in her hands. \"There must be something serious on your mind, my dear,\" conti nued Sublimus. \" If I can relieve you, why not tell me? I love you to that degree, that I would go through fire if it would make you mine.\" \" If you will listen to me with a calm and patient ear, and promise not to reveal what I may unfold.\" \" On my honor, no !\" exclaimed Sublimus. 44 Well, then, dear Charles. May I call you so ?\" 44 You know you may, you little rogue,\" exclaimed Sublimus, beside himself with joy at the arch look his fair companion gave him. 41 You know that I have to depend upon my own exertions for a living.\" \" I do, but I love you better for it.\" \" If I did not think so, I would not make a confidant of you. You do not drink your wine. For the last two months I have been unem ployed ; all the means that I possessed have dwindled by degrees away, and I am left without a penny in the wide world. I have not"], [82, "66 aunt Eliza's gabbet. tasted food to-day since breakfast, and to-morrow my landlady threatens to turn me into the streets, unless I pay my rent. What, dear Charles, shall I do then, unless I meet with some kind creature who will lend me a small loan to pay my rent ? If I could meet with such a friend, I should be able to get employ to-morrow, because I could give security for my work. If you, dear Charles, could do it, I would crawl upon the ground to serve you.\" 41 How much do you want ?'' \" I could manage with five pounds.\" 44 1 have only four,\" returned Sublimus. 44 That would be a great help. It would save me from the streets, end I would work night and day until I repaid it.\" \" If I lent it you, you would laugh at me, and \u2014 \u2014 .\" \" Indeed I would not. I would die to serve you !\" \u2022' Will you promise faithfully to grant me all I ask you V 44 Anything you will, dear Charles, only save me from the streets * 44 Then take the money \u2014 four pounds. You know where to write to me. I can't stay much longer now ; meet me to-morrow, and repay me for my generosity .\" \" And do you doubt me ?\" exclaimed Miss Johnson, reproachfully. 41 No ; but it is a great sacrifice I have made \u2014 but we must part.\" Sublimus began to grow nervous, and to regret the step he had taken; so to shake off that feeling, he determined to hasten home and seek the shelter of Mrs. Quizby. As soon as they had separated, Miss Johnson carefully put the money in her purse, and mentally said \u2014 \" he wishes me to meet him to-morrow, and to yield, as he mawkishly said, 'to his loving embrace ;' if I do, let me sink to the lowest hard-worked, half-starved needle-woman in all London.' CHAPTER XI. Earlv on the following morning Aunt Eliza sought out the residence of A[rs. Jennings, and presented Miss Johnson's note to her. Mrs. Jennings, who was a rather stout, well-made woman, with large, deep blue eyes, that had a merry twinkling, laughing expression, conti nually playing about them, received her with a degree of cordiality"], [83, "aunt Eliza's garret. 67 that quite surprised Aunt Eliza, who, in a few moments found herself receiving instructions how to proceed about her new work. She was now>in an entirely new position, a learner, and had to sit and work with the rest of the hands. The remark which Miss Johnson had made on the previous evening in respect to her working in the room whew several girls were at work, came upon her for the first time with all its force. When she was at Jones's, there was scarcely a word spoken from morning until night. Here, Mrs. Jennings, who had been a common needle girl, sat and worked in the midst of them, and gave and received her immoral jest with the same spirit as the rest. Aunt Eliza felt the truth of Miss Johnson's remark most bitterly. She could not help admitting to herself that of all places in the world, if you wish to rob a girl of the power to blush, there was no place so well adapted for the purpose as a London workroom of needle girls. From the dirtiest and most slovenly attired to the cleanest and the neatest \u2014 from the plainest to the prettiest \u2014 all have their degrees and manners of expression. Some aim at coarseness and vulgarity ; others seek to give utterance to jests the most obscene with the most pleasing and winning expression of the counteuance that robs it of half its vulgarism. Yet each and every one has a soul and talentB that would have fitted them for the best positions of society, and all of them have, at some time or other, possessed that native modesty which belongs only to woman when pure and spotless. It is not a criminal act alone that robs woman of her virtue. It is as much lost to her when she can listen to an immoral jest unmoved, as if she had been guilty by commission. It is not virtue that keeps her what she is, but calcu- lation. If she be undefiled, as commonly understood, it is not because of the wrong, but because of iuterest ; aud acts, more criminal in them- selves than the one great fault that stamps the brand of shame upon a woman, become of daily occurrence ; then all the pure, womatly feelings hourly vanish from the breast, to give place to cunning and treachery. Who is there, that having once spent an hour in such society, and having any love for a sister, would look unmoved, at that sister's living and breathing in the same atmosphere with those poorly paid needle girls 1 Girls who work for the sake of appearance, but who are, alas! too often unrepentant Magdalens, for tbe purpose of keeping from themselves the griping pangs of hunger. Bind a girl to a business where she will have to work with her needle, and you place her on the high road to prostitution, and if she fall short of the goal, it is not you wlio bound her that she will have to tkanlgf The lady who, dressed in finest linen, aud bedecked with all the semptiess's art, as she rolls past in her carriage may possibly be ignorant of the"], [84, "68 AUNT ELIZA'S GARRET. misery that produced the garments which she wears. It is not there, however, that we throw the blame. Sae too often pays the bill that is sent her without quarrelling with the items ; but it is to the shop- keepers, the traders, the middle classes, v. no cut and cut, and grind and grind, the very bones of their fellow-beings to make their bread and to add to their own means, where blame is most due. Fathers and mothers, city tradespeople, it is you who, to add to your children's pride, compel the offspring of some broken] tradesman to suffer, dooming her to a life of wretched slavery and degradation. Just think of this when next you purchase some cheap advertised article, and ask yourself how you would like your daughter to toil for fifteen hours daily, and to be subject to those immodest jests that hundreds of her fellow sex are daily aud hourly suffering in this boasting land of ours, merely to pamper the whim of some other mother, who is fond to see her daughters dressed in the finest linen, and smiling at them In their good looks, blesses her fate that enabled her to get the thing. So good and so aheap \u2014 a perfect bargain. But why waste time with these remarks? AVhile the love of grinding and of making cheap bargains exists, no one will care who suffers so long as he can save. Whilst Aunt Eliza is studying her new branch of trade, we will return once more to the offices of Messrs. Thompson, Hickory and Thompson. Seated on his stool is Mr. Sublimus Quizby, deeply engaged in his ledger. He is extremely quiet this morning, and it is with a great degree of difficulty that a word can be obtained from him. \"Ton my word, Quizzy,\" exclaims one of the clerks, \"one would think you had paid your devotions to Bacchus last night, and that you were down a peg or two in consequence.\" \" How many times have I informed you, sir,\" returned Sublimus, 41 that my name is not Quizzy, but Quizby ? I don't allow people to call me by any other name.\" \" I'm very sorry,\" continued the first speaker. \" I had a very charitable object in view when I spoke ; but if you are so very touchy, I'll say nothing about it.\" \" Well, if you stand a pot of fourpenny, I have no objection to pardon the insult. But talking of names, that puts me in mind of a circumstance that occurred to me when I was in the Isle of Wight. \" Oh, never mind the Isle of Wight,\" exclaimed his tormentor. \" Oh, well, if you won't listen, I won't tell it you. My friend, who Is now Mayor of Southampton, and I were once sitting together, a carriage drew up at the door, and a nobleman alighted. He had a very pretty girl by his side, and as soon as he saw my friend, the Mayor of Southampton, he caught hold of his hand and shook it with"], [85, "aunt eliza's garret. 69 the warmth of an old friend. Thin turning to mo, he said, ' what, Quizzy ! you are still in the land of the living.' I said, ' I \"beg your lordship's pardon, my name is Quizby \u2014 Sublimus Quizby.' ' Ah,weli,' said his lordship, 'I forgot that, but let us have some lunch, my friend, aud let me have some lamb chops, I'm partial to that kind of food, you know.' ' Ah, my lord,' I replied, ' we have not such a thing as a lamb chop in the place.' ' Ab '.' said he, ' chops are wanting, when chaps are wanting chops.' That was not a bad conceit \u2014 was it ?\" \" What's a conceit, Quizzy, eh ?\" \"Why, an idea of course : I don't know that I can just at the moment give you the root of the word, but it's an idea.\" \" Then if that's the case what a great idea you must be.\" \" Why so '!\" demanded Sublimus. \" Because you are one great lump of conceit.\" \" Did you mean that for wit ?\" demanded Sublimus. \" No, Quizzy.\" \" Quizby, if you please.\" \" Well , then, Quizby. Do you always go by that name ?\" \" Of course I do.\" \" Oh ! what does that young lady call you, the dear creature, that you pay your addresses to by the sly, passing yourself off os a single young man? Ah! Quizzy, it's too bad of you, it is.\" \"What do you mean to insinuate?\" demanded Quizby, rather warmly. \" You know, sir, that I despise such base deception. I should be afraid to look Mrs. Quizby in the face were I to be base enough to sink to such acts.\" \"All very fine, Quizby, but that logic don't bold good here. How about that girl I saw you with last night ?\" Quizby began to tremble. Was it possible he had been seen ? \" What do you mean, sir ? I deny that I was with anyone beside Mrs. Quizby. I certainly took a Btroll last night for the benefit of my health : a man wants that after having been penned up hero all the week.\" \" Well, I won't say anything about it,\" returned his tormentor ; 41 only if Mrs. Quizby should manage to hear of it, don't say I told her. I don't dislike your taste at all, but I certainly \"wonder at the girl's.\" \" I don't understand you,\" exclaimed Sublimus, \" there would be nothing strange in a young lady having a slight penchant for me. But talking of that puts me in mind of a circumstance that came under my own knowledge. George, the youth in this office, lives, as you know, with hiefeaunt. She's rather a pretty woman ; aud has for the last 13"], [86, "aunt Eliza's garret. 70 week or two worked for a friend OT mine \u2014 a Mr. Jones. A gay dog be is, too. ' He, therefore, determined to make Mrs. Pratt Ms own. So after giving her a good salary for a little time, he at last succeeded in his purposes. But it appears that George's sister is younger than Mrs. Pratt, find used to have some work at home. One day my friend Jones, called on the young girl, the pretence being about the work, and was at once struck with her opparenee, and without losing any time made love to her and not without success. By and by, Mrs. Pratt gets to hear of the matter, and so has a tremendous row. Last Saturday night she leaves the shop, and claims a lot extra for over work. So you see if you are in search for a lady-love, there are two for you to choose from. I can give you an introduction.\" \" You know them then ?\" asked the clerk. 41 1 knew her husband, that's how it is.\" 41 Indeed !\" returned the clerk, leaving the room to fetch another ledger from the safe. As he was Btanding examining the ledger at the door of the safe, George entered the room. He had been out upon au errand. \" Well, George !\" exclaimed the young man, \" have you been to see your aunt's and your sister's lover f\" \" What do you mean, sir i\" asked George, his colour rising to his face. \" Do you know a Mr. Jones T 41 1 have heard of such a man,\" returned George. I don't know him : \u00bby aunt and sister have worked for him, I bdieve.\" \" Oh ! they've worked for him, havo they V continued the young man, turning over the folios of the ledger, and appearing to run up the different amounts the* presented themselves to his view. \" Yes, sir\u2014 why do you ask ?\" inquired George. \" It's rather difficult lo make both ends meet by the needle, I should fancy.\" 44 We do have a rather hard pull for it, I believe,\" continued George ; \"but, I hope, when 1 get on, to be able to give a better helping band.\" \" It's very praiseworthy of you, George,\" returned the young man, seriously, \" but it may be too late then.\" \" I tell you what, Mr. Godfrey,\" exclaimed George, rather warmly, \" there seems to me as if there's something under all this. You never spoke to me so much about my friends before, why do you presume upon it now ?\" \" The young fellow has got some spirit,\" thought Godfrey, \" I should like to see how he would attack old Sublime. He's so very civil to that old fool, I am half inclined to think there's some truth in what he says.\""], [87, "aunt eliza's qarret. 71 44 Quizby, I believe, is a great friend of your's \u2014 is he not?\" demanded Godfrey, after a short, pause. \" He knew my uncle,\" returned George ; \" aud knowing how ray aunt and we. were left, he told me of this place, and spoke to Mr. Thompson about me. I owe him thanks for that, our friendship is nothing more. But why do you ask ?\" \" Your aunt's a pretty woman ?\" 44 She's not ugly,\" returned Georgc. \" Your sister's passable, too V George was thunder-stricken. \" At least,\" continued Godfrey, \" in the opinion of Mr. Jones.\" \" I cannot tell,\" r.piied George. \" I did not know that he was a judge of beauty.\" \" Oh, but he is,\" returned Godfrey ; \" at least, I am given to under stand so, I don't know the man myself. He is a man, too, that likes to taste of every flower he sees.\" \" What has that to do with me, or my aunt, or my sister ?\" asked George. \" Not at all, perhaps. A man may seek the favors of another man's aunt, without putting himself in such a position that the nephew may sue him. A nephew is not, certainly, in the same place as a husband. I'm not so sure that a brother may not bring an action against the seducer of his sister.\" \" Good God, Mr. Godfrey !\" exclaimed George, \" what do you mean ? are you joking? because if you are, I beg you will remember that yoa touch me on a tender part.\" \" Never was more serious in my life,\" returned Godfrey ; \" but as you seem to be suffering from a kind of mental excitement, I'll just open your eyes a bit. Your aunt and sister both worked for Jones \u2014 you admit that. Jones and Quizby are friends it appears, and Jones has been talking to Quizby about them. Jones is a gay dog, and needle women have anything but a good name for virtue. Quizby comes here aud makes a kind of boast that his friend, Jones \u2014 who, you must bear in mind, he represents as being capable of doing anything \u2014has succeeded in seducing both your aunt and sister.\" \" Quizby says this, does he ?\" asked George, turning very pale. \" He said so not five minutes before you came in,\" returned Godfrey. \" He must make some mistake ; you must have misunderstood him. Let me hear what he'll 3ay to me.\" And George rushed from one room into the other. \" Now for it,\" muttered Godfrey to himself. \" I say, Mr. Quizby, began George, \" what's this you have beea telling Mr, Godfrey ?\""], [88, "aunt Eliza's oarrbt. 72 \"About what do you mean?\" demanded Quizby, very politely. \" I have been talking to him about so many things that, just at the moment, I can't tell to what you refer.\" \" About my aunt and sister,\" returned George. \"Ah, yes, I think we did say something about them, but it was merely a passing remark about needle women in general, and that Mr. Jones would not long keep a worker before he attempted an improper familiarity.\" \" You did not say, then, that that Improper familiarity had already taken place,\" returned Gi \" I dan't think I could have said anything that could have been so construed,\" replied Sublimus. \" Then either you or Mr. Godfrey is a liar,\" exclaimed George, passionately. \" I am not the liar,\" returned Godfrey, who had been listening to the conversation. ' \" I do believe It,\" continued George, \" for no one but a mean, lying, cowardly wretch, would speak so of two poor women who have nothing but their name.\" \u25a0\u2022 if you say I'm, a liar,\" hissed Sublimus, \" I shall ring for Mr. Thompson. \"I say again, you are a paltry liar; and if you attempt to raise your hand to ring the bell, I'll knock you down with the ruler.\" \"Get away, sir,\" exclaimed Sublimus, \"you ought to be ashamed of yourself. I'll soon see whether this is to be allowed in the counting house.\" So saying, he got down from his stool to ring Mr. Thompson's bell, who was up in his private room. He was no sooner on his legs than George, like a young tiger, flew at Sublimus, and struck him two severe blows in the face that quite disfigured him. Sublimus, to pro tect himself, pushed George from him, and then took up the rule. George, seeing this, thought Quizby was going to strike him with it. As rj u ic i_ as thought he seized the pewter inkstand, and hurled it at Quizby's head. Fortunately it just escaped him, although all the contents were emptied over an opened ledger, and Thompson's pride was in having the cleanest set of books in all London. \"Good God! what is to be done?\" exclaimed Godfrey, seeing how the ledger stood. \" We can never keep this from old Thompson ; he'll discharge every one of us. Look sharp, and give me the blotting paper.\" And as he spoke, and before the ink could be blotted up, Mr. Thompson entered. \" What's that ' Mr. Godfrey,\" demanded Mr. Thompson, putting his spectacles off his uose and making them rest upon hi\u00a7 forehead, a sure sign that his passion was beginning to rise."], [89, "aunt eliza's garret. 73 \" An accident, sir,\" returned Godfrey. \" An accident, sir,\" repeated Thompson. \" Explain, sir \u2014 explain, sir. That ledger's spoilt, sir\u2014 completely spoilt. I shall be compelled to have a new ledger, and all the accounts re-posted. Explain, sir! why don't you explain, sir 1\" \" It is not my affair, sir,\" returned Godfrey ; \"I merely rushed to lend assistance.\" \"Whose affair is it, then?' \"If you will permit me to explain, I think I can put the matter to rest,\" exclaimed Sublimus. \" It is thus : Mr. Godfrey and I had somo conversation irrespective of the business of the firm. This young gentleman had ihe impertinence to say I was a liar \u2014 yes, sir, a liar ! I told him if he did not cease to speak in that manner, I should ring for you ; when he called me a mean, paltry liar. I rose from my stool to call you, when he struck me in the mouth, causing the dis figurement which yon may perceive, and finished by hurling the ink stand at my head, which I would rather it had hit than it should have so disfigured your ledger. I can only say I cm truly sorry that it happened.\" \" How is this, young man ? Do you admit calling this gentleman a liar f asked Mr. Thompson of George. \"Yes, sir, I do,\" George replied; \"and if you will listen to the cause .\" That's quite enough, sir ; no cause can justify a boy calling a gen tleman, and ono so much hie elder, a liar.\" \" But, Bir!\" etcloimed George 41 1 have heard quite enough,\" returned old Thompson. \" Yon admit having used the expression. Mr. Godfrey, step across to Letts, and tell them to send in another ledger as soon as possible ; explain to them the reason. You, young man, can wait till Mr. Stedman, the cashier, comes in. He will pay you this week's salary and a week in advance. You can then leave the co_nting-house directly. And yon, Mr. Quizby, must work overtime, without remuneration, until this ledger be re-posted into the new one, and carefully compared into the bargain. Thus ended George's first engagement."], [90, "74 AUNT FI.IZA'S OARBFT.. CHAPTER XII. WniLB the events which are recorded in tho foregoing chapter were ,iig, Amelia had determined to go in search of work; so, having made arrangements with tho landlady to take care of Joey during her absence, she sallied into the streets in the hope of finding Some employment which she could do at home, and thus add a littlo to their income. She attired herself with tho greatest care, and a smile lit op her Countenance as she thought to herself what a surpriso it would be to her aunt and George when they returned home and found her at work. She had called at several warehouses and had been refused ; or, at least, told that she could have work if she liked to come into the warehouse ; but \u00bb this was not what she wanted, she continued her search. She was, however, unfortunate, for the work that was given out w\u00bbs such, that she, alone, could not undertake. She had wandered in her search so far as Rogent Street, aud whilst standing watching her opportunity to croes the road, her eye fell on a paper stuck upon a board, which paper announced thai an apprentice was wanted to the dress-making business. Tho announcement drew her attention very strangely; not that there was anything particular about tbe hand-bill, feat it was otto of those circumstances which frequently occur to all of us, when we find ourselves, without knowing why, staring at something without being at tho first at all conscious of what that something may be. AYheh the meaning of the words began to be clearly understood by Amelia, she mentally said : \u2014 \" I have a great mind to go and Bee what sort of a place it is. If it .is worth anything, I may possibly, after all, induce aunt to let our landlady take care of Joey during the day\u2014 she seems a careful old damo \u2014 and I could then, possibly, be .doing something as well as George.\" While she was thus meditating, little did she dream of what was occurring at the counting-house of Messrs. Thompson. Hickory and Thompson. At length, she determined to see the parties who had published the hand-bill ; and, taking note of the address, she ut once directed her steps thitherward. The place where she was to call was one of those shops that abound at the west end of London, and which are generally styled \" fashionable shops.\" As soon as she had passed through the door of plate glass-, she felt half inclined to retreat. It was the first time in her life that she had entered such a superb shop -, she was, therefore, struck with"], [91, "aunt eliza's garret. 75 amazement at Its fitments. The rich carpet that eoivered the floor, tho mahogany table in the stead of a common counter, the number of easy chairs, and the costly mirrors reaching to the ground wherein to reflect the figure of the aristocratic beauty, who should condescend to enter that manufactory of ladies' attire, quite bewildered Amelia. She stood, therefore, scarcely knowing whether to advance, stand still, or to retreat into the street. \" Permlttez mol pour deraander your plosare,\" exclaimed a lady on the wrong side of thirty, but who, nevertheless, was a fashionable, if not a fine figure, and who one might\u2014 being an admirer of pretty women \u2014 fall desperately in love with, without being considered as Insane. She had a method of speaking to those Bhe thought were not good French scholars in half English and half French, in the manner quoted above, but with her customers she could invariably make herself very well understood in the English language ; and no wonder either, when it is taken into consideration that she was an Euglish woman. She had originally been an apprentice to a lYench woman, who, having died, she succeeded in obtaining the favor of tbe husband, who eventually married her ; at any rate, it was so as far as appear ances. She managed the bns;ne^s for him, took trips to Paris on uis account for the fashions, and so forth. She went by his name, and the business was called her's. The brass plate on the door still retained the name of Madame Dupont, and this lady of course assumed to her self all the right, title, and interest of the said Madame Dupont, and by many of the hands who worked for her she was known as no other than that most illustrious personage. 44 1 beg your pardon, madam,\" Amelia begaa, her cheek colour ing up as if she had beeu doing a guilty act. \" I am afraid I have made some mistake ; I came here in consequence of a bill I saw, stating that an apprentice was wanted.\" \u2022 Oni, oui ! c'est correct,\" returned the lady in her broken English. but whiob, for the benefit of the reader, we will pat in the correct orthography. \" Oh ! it is here,\" said Amelia. 44 Yes, we are in want of a hand now. Do you know anything about the business?\" asked Madame Dupont. \" Tin afraid not,\" returned Amelia , \" I have only given my attention to embroidery.\" 44 You understand embroidery then,\" said Madame Dupont. \" Yes, ma'am.\" \" Well, then, I think we can manage to come to some terms with you. I have been wanting a hand who could embroider well. If I"], [92, "76 AUNT ELIZA'S 0ABRET. approve of your work, and you like to come to me upon half pay, yon shall learn the business. Of course, that is upon the consideration of your doing what embroidery I may want. If you did not do that, I should require you to come to work for me for a twelvemonth for nothing.\" \" How long would you require me to work for half-pay, Madame?\" demanded Amelia. \" For at least six months, and be regularly bound for that time. Of course your tea is found you ; we do sometimes eive an extra tea \u2014 a kind of supper \u2014 when we have to work late, but we don't make a promise to do that.\" \"I will talk to my aunt about it,\" returned Amelia, \"aud if she approve of it I will come.\" \" When may I know your dedsion ?' 44 To-morrow,\" answered Amelia. 44 Of course, if you understand your business at the expiration of that time, we should employ you in preference to a stranger. So, you see, there is a chan' . of constant employment.\" \" Thank you. l .'am,\" returned Amelia. I will let you know to morrow. Good moi ning.\" Madame Dupont I owed, and Amelia left the shop and hastened homewards. It was with a great deal of pleasure she learned from her landlady -bat neither her aunt nor her brother had been home. \"Well, and what success, miss, have you made?\" asked Mrs. Jackson, the landlady. Amelia then explained to her what had transpired between Madame Dupont and herself, and what her ideas wore concerning little Joey. \" A very good plan, too,\" returned Mrs. Jackson ; \" though, of course, you could not suppose that 1 could take care of him without some little remuneration ; but, ye see, miss, as it is likely to give you a business and constant work in the long run, I should decidedly say it was your best plan, and I dessy your aunt and me could come to terms about the chil'.\" \"I hope so,\" returned Amelia; \"we shall see.\" So saying, she proceeded up stairs with little Joey in her arms to her own rooms. She had scarcely taken her things off and re-lit the fire, when George entered the room. His face was pale, and his eyes were red and swollen, as if he had been crying. \" Good gracious, George !\" exclaimed Amelia, \" whatever is the matter ? Have you been doing anything wrong )\" \" Oh! don't ask me,\" returned George, bursting into tears again."], [93, "aunt eliza's garret. \u25a0 7 \" Whatever is the matter, George?

I might have known how it would have ended, if I had thought a moment about it. But then, Meeley, it could be carried farther still. Suppose I struck him in the face, and threw a leaden inkstand at him ; what should you think me deserving of then ?\" \" But did you do all this ?\" asked Amelia, in surprise. \" Yes, I did,\" returned George. 41 Why, whatever could you have been thinking about ? you must 'have been mad !'* exclaimed Amelia. \" I was mad,\" returned George, in a voice broken by passion and vexation ; \" yet knowing, feeling how my passion has led me astray, I should do it all over again, if I were put in the same position.\" \" Oh, nonsense, George, don't talk like that!\" exclaimed Amelia. \" You always were hasty, and like most passionate people, you like to find an excuse for your fault.\" \" That's it,\" returned George, \" treat me like old Thompson did,\u2014 judge me without hearing me.\" \" Hearing you ! Is it not enough to know that yon, a mere boy, have dared to call a man a liar, and to add to the offence, you say have struck him ? Quite enough, without hearing more.

If I had been the man, I would have given you a sound thrashing, and richly you deserved it.\" \"Amelia!\" screamed George, \"answer me, and don't you blame mo. If I have done wrong, I havo been punished, more than I can bare, already.\" \" Not more thau you deserve,\" returned Amelia. \" Suppose, Amelia, you were a boy, and had a sister that yon loved, would you not defend her if she were attacked ?\" \" Of course I should,\" returned Artelia. \" Even as a woman, if you were attacked, I should do my best to defend you. But what has that to do with what we are talking about ?\" \"What,\" continued George, \" if that sister were made the scots and by-word amongst the men with whom you were engaged ? what if you were told that she, your sister, was common to every man who chose to pay her price ?\" \"I would knefck him down, the brute!\" returned Amelia, her face becoming crimson from the very thought. \" You would do that, and yet just now you said there was no dr cumstance that could excuse what I have done,\" exclaimed George. \" Nothing but that,\" returned Amelia. \" And that I plead as my excuse,\" replied George, warmly. 44 Quizby bragged in the office that Jones had paid his addresses to both you and aunt, and had succeeded with you both. Young Mr. Godfrey told me of it. I taxed Quizby with it. He denied it. I ealled him a liar. Ho threatened to call Mr. Thompson. I struck nim in tbe. mouth, and finished by throwing the inkstand at his head. If I had cut it open, I should not have cared, and possibly I might still be in my situation ; but the ink went over a ledger. I, of course, was blamed. Judged as you judged me just now; and here I am without a place.\" \" God bless you, dear !\" exclaimed Amelia, os she flew to her bro ther's arms, and kissed him with all the warmth of a sister who loves her brother, and is proud of him. \" God bless you, dear ! don't think of the harsh words I have said. If you could have heard me slandered, and not have acted as you have, I should have despised you as much as now I love and admire you.\" 14 But what shall I do ? God knows how long it may be before I get another situation.\" \" Never mind that, dear. Aunt and I would rather work our singers to their very bones, than that you should bow and cringe to such a sneak aa Quizby.\""], [95, "aunt Eliza's garret. 79 CHAPTER XIII. It was late at night when Aunt Eliza lest her new occupation. She was completely exhausted by her day's work, for she hud been sitting close at it for nearly fourteen hours, and the lost words Mrs. Jennings said to her as she left tho workroom were: \u2014 44 Be sure and be here by seven in the morning, Pratt ; we must make hay, you know, while the sun shines.\" With a saddened and depressed spirit Aunt Eliza wended her way homeward. She felt within herself as if, since the morning, she had fallen in the social scale ; and as she recalled tc her mind some of the remarks that bad been made to her, she could not help weeping. \"How long am I to remain thus?\" eho asked herself. \"Am I never to get on in the world, or am I to sink lower and lower ? Thank God ! George Is in something ; we may manage to keep life in us while he receives his money ; aud perhaps, in a few months he may have a rise in his salary, for he is a good boy, that's somo consolation. And how many are there who only have that amount to live on ? How they manage I am at a loss to tell ; yet they seem to always dress well, showily at least, and to go out to amusements occasionally. It may be that the change I have experienced makes it seem so strange to me. If I had always been what they are, I might, perchance, have thought nothing about it.\" When she had reached home, there was a fire burning in the hearth, and though it was late at night, the kettle was humming on the hob, and throwing into the room long jets of steam ; whilst the lid, as if in very joy to see her enter, began to dance and clatter in that particular manner, that one might almost fancy its delight was so great that it had brought on severe convulsions in the very endeavour to keep its feelings within proper bounds. As soon as Aunt Eliza had entered the room, Amelia entwined her arms round her neck, and, with that quiet manner so peculiar to her, released her aunt from her bonnet and shawl, placed her in a, chair by the fire, and in a few seconds gave her a cup of nice, hot tea. There was something so feeling and considerate in all this that Aunt Eliza began to blame herself for having allowed the spirit of discontent to have once raised its complaining voice within her breast ; and, as she cast her eyes on little Joey, as he lay in his usual corner, smiling in his sleep, she gently stooped down and kissed his lips, determining within her own mind that, come what might, she would fight bravely on, for, .urely, ehe thought, M It is a long lane that hae no turning.\""], [96, "80 aunt Eliza's garret. The meal was passed over in silence. Amelia saw that her aunt was tired and low spirited ; she, therefore, thought it best to wait until she had had some rest and refreshment, before she questioned her about herself, or informed her of what had occurred to George, who 6at in his usual place nursing his knee, and swinging backwards and forwards gazing at the fire, as was his constant habit. As he cast a sideway look towards his aunt, he could not help notidng how pale she was, and how bloodshot her eyes had grown. A frown gathered on his brow and a peculiar wild expression lit up his eye as he thought upon the occurrences of the morning, and inwardly blamed himself for not having gone a more judicious way to punish Quizby. As it was he had only added to that man's vile blow upon bis aunt. Quizby had assailed her character ; he, himself, had struck a blow upon her pocket, and that, too, without clearing away, the blot that Quizby had cast upon her fame. \"What's the matter with George to-night?\" asked Aunt Eliza of Amelia. \" He has scarcely spoken a word since I have been home.\" \" He is rather low-spirited to-night ?\" returned Amelia. \"Nonsense,\" said her aunt, trying to emile. \"It can't be low spirits, he is always too fond of fun and mischief for that.\" George tried to Bmile also, and continued to nurse his knee more affectionatdy, if possible, than ever. It was, however, a very poor attempt at a smile ; just a passing gleam of sunshine that left the cloud on hi a pale face darker than it was before. \" Things have not gone bo smooth at the counting-house as they might have gone, I believe,\" returned Amelia, \" and that makes him rather dull.\" \" Ah !\" continued her aunt, addressing George, \"yon must take care. If you were to Iobb that situation, you might never get such another. I was thinking of you as I came home. I thought that while you retained your place, and received your money weekly, if the worst came to the worst it would keep us from the streets, leaving out of tho question the probability of your ultimately getting more money. And who knows, George, that if you pay very great attention, but what you may some day become a partner in the firm ; or, at least, be able to go into business on your own account, and become, like the elder Mr. Thompson, the founder of another firm. Snch things have hap pened before now and will again, no doubt. And what is there to prevent you from being one of the examples f \" Many things, aunt,\" returned George, his brow growing darker and darker. \" Of course,\" she continued, \" if you make them ; but where there's"], [97, "AUNT ELIZA'* GARRET. 81 a will there's a way, and instead of making obstacles, your objc-t should be to clear them from your path.\" \" It is very easy to talk, aunt, is it not ?\" said George, \" but obsta cles are sometimes too heavy to be moved.\" \" Climb over them,\" \" And sometimes too steep to be climbed,\" continued George ; \" more fall headlong down, I fancy, than succeed in gaining the summit. \" Aunt Eliza remained silent for a time ; she thought George was half in the right, though she did not wish to think so. \"You must be wrong, George,\" exclaimed Amelia, after a few minutes thought. \" If more people failed than succeeded, the world would be going back, and it strikes me that it's going the other way. Therefore, more people get on than fail. There are, no doubt, a great many failures, and we possibly may rank among them, but that would not alter the fact.\" \" I wish I had your mind,\" exclaimed George, looking affectionately at his sister, \"you seem to see into things farther than anyone else.\" \" So will you, George, when you get as old as I am,\" returned Amelia. \"Two years will make a difference to you, especially if you pass them in the counting-house.\" 44 If I do,\" continued George, gloomily. * \"What then has happened?\" demanded Aunt Eliza, \"for you seem to be very uncomfortable about the counting-house.\" \" Why, aunt,\" returned George, \" there were a few words said this morning that I did not much admire.\" \" So there were where I have beeu,\" replied Aunt Eliza. \" I did not like them, certainly, but I was obliged to take them from whence they came. A quiet tongue, you may depend upon it, is the best thing for all of us, especially for a youth.\" \" It is not every one who can keep a quiet tongue,\" replied George. 44 If they have no business of their own to talk about they talk of their neighbours, and, of course, slander them.\" \" If that were all,\" returned his aunt, \" you have to trouble you, \u2014a mere word spoken possibly in an unguarded moment \u2014 I am sure you have no cause to make you sad. You should have more depen dence on yourself, George, than to care for what any one says about you. It shows there must be some worth in you, or they would not try and injure you. Besides. George, you ought to be rather thankful than otherwise. You have an opportunity offered you at such times to hear what your enemies can say about you. You know, then, where they can attack you, and you can from that correct what's wrong, and live in such a way as to _.iake them, by your actions, belie themselves.\"."], [98, "82 AUNT ELIZA'S OARRKT. \" It Is not that, aunt,\" returned George ; \" so your sermon, though very good in its way, don't exactly apply ; unless, indeed, you cau apply it to yourself, and that, I rather think, you'll find somewhat difficult. People who preach, you know, are not always the first to practise what they preach. It is always ' do as I say aud not as I do.\" 41 In what way does it refer to me ?\" asked his Aunt. George then explained to her as carefully and as delicately as be could what Quizby had said about her and his sister, and how he, George, had served him for the lie he had given ntterance to, and how he had lost his situation in consequence. Aunt Eliza was by no meaus a practical philosopher. The doctrine which she had but a few moments before been instilling Into the mind of her nephew had no hold upon her own. It was truly os George had said. Few preachers are doers, and when George attempted to cool her temper by quoting her own words it but added to it. \" The hypocrite !\" she exclaimed, as she paced the room to and fro, \"but I'll make him suffer for it. I'll go and sec Mr. Thompson myself, and tell him all about it.\" \"That would not make his ledger clean,\" exclaimed George. \" But it will justify you,\" returned his aunt. \" I tell you I do believe he would not have interfered in the matter if it had not been for the ledger. He was told the quarrel was nothing at all to do with the business of the office ; but spoiling the ledger was like throwing the inkstand at him. Both Mr. Godfrey and Mr. Stedman have promised me \u2014 for they neither of them like Quizby\u2014 to watch their opportunity, aud, if they can, before another youth is got, to explain to Mr. Thompson the whole matter. He will listen to what Mr. Stedman says, in preference to his own son ; they have known each other for a good many years.\" \" I wish you had hit him with it !\" exclaimed his aunt, \" it would have served him no more than right ; as it is, he has escaped almost free, whilst we still suffer.\" \" It is that which hurts me,\" continued George. 4* I have added to the injury. I wish I had waited until he was in the street, and then have pitched into him. I fancy I should then have had the beet of it.\" \" No you would not, George,\" exclaimed Amelia, \"for though I am glad you served him as you did, and had I been in your place I should, in all probability, have acted as you have acted ; yet, sitting quietly here, I cannot but admit that fighting does but little good. It never . \u25a0 ttles a dispute ; and, if you had thrashed him, though it might have served him right, it would not have robbod his slander one iota of itB sting.\""], [99, "AUNT ELIZA'S GARRET. 83 *' It would have made him hold his tongue for tne future,\" returned George. \"No, it would not. With such a man as Quizby a good thrashing would have the effect of mailing him more cautious in his remarks, more cunning aud more hypocritical. You may rost assured that the best policy is to take no notice of the matter, or of the man, and he will outlie himself. By showing much anxiety about it, you lay yourself open to the remark that there must be something in it. Once give people an opportunity to say that, and they become ready to believe anything and everything. Let us, therefore, let the matter rest, and think what had better be done under the circumstances. They do say that when one door shuts another opens. Now, aunt, I have been out to-day to see if I could obtain work.\" 41 You have !\" exclaimed Aunt Eliza, in surprise. \"Yes, /have,\" returned Amelia. 41 And what did you do with Joey ?\" asked her aunt. 44 1 got Mrs. Jackson to take care of him the little time I was out. She's a motherly sort of a woman, with only one great fault\u2014 sdfishness. \u25a0 Wdl, go on,\" said her aunt. Amelia then related an account of her interview with Madame Dupont, and finished by saying : \u2014 \" So you see, aunt, if we could make any terms with our landlady to take care of Joey while we are out \u2014 and while George is out of employment he could see that she attended to hi_a \u2014 I could be learning a business, and receiving a salary r.t the same time, With the prospect of eventually getting constant work \u2014 no mean consideration \u2014 and those people certainly do pay better than the warehouses in the city.\" Amelia, after some little assistance from George, in the shape of arguments aud promises to see that Joey was not ueg'ected, at length succeeded in inducing her aunt to consent to her taking the situation offered. In a few minutes afterwards they had forgotten all their trials and troubles in the oblivion occasioned by a sound sleep. In the morning Aunt Eliza again sought the work-room of Mrs. Jennings, but though she had slept soundly during the few hours that she had had for rest, it was not sufficient. Her cheeks were pale ; her lips were parched, and spoke but too plainly of inward fever, and her eyes had assumed a glassy brightness, whilst into the deep corners of both, the crimson blood had penetrated, \u2014 facts which spoke trumpet-tongued of her great suffering. \" You are not used to so much work,\" said Mrs. Jennings to her"], [100, "aunt eliza's garret. 84 about eleven o'clock. \" You seem tired and exhausted already. It won't do for you to go on like this, you inu.-l have something to sup port you. AVhat say you, ladies, to a little lunch .\" \" By all means,\" was the unanimous reply. \" I was about to hint at it myself,\" exclaimed one of the girls. \" I feel quite u.,cd up myself. I was at a ball last night, and have not been to bed yet.\" 44 AVell, then, ladies, club round,\" exclaimed Mrs. Jennings. \" Here, Miss Morgan, suppose you collect the pence.\" Miss Morgan arose from her seat forthwith. The girl3 at once commenced dipping thdr hands into their pockets in the search for a penny, which all managed to bring forth, and gave it into Mis; Morgan's custody. No one was allowed to shirk the contribution, though they might be at liberty to refuse participating in its produce. \" What is it for ?\" asked Aunt Eliza, as she handed her penny to Mis3 Morgan. \" Where have you been all your life time,\" asked one ol the girls who sat next to her, \" that you don't know what this is for T 41 Not in a work-room,\" returned Aunt Eliza, with difficulty re straining her tears, for the question had recalled the recollection of years of ease and comfort ; and, although she had not, pa-sod an indo lent life, she was by no means prepared to pass through the scenes in which she was placed unmoved. \" I guessed as much,\" returned the girl, and then, in au under tone, she hurriedly said, \"I am sorry I spoke ; never mind. Don't let any of the girls see you feel it, or they'll take offence at it.\" While she was thus whispering her hasty apology, she appeared to be examining the texture of Aunt Eliza's dress. She then added aloud, \" lhat'_ rather a nice dress you have got on, I should like to have one like it.\" \" You'll have no dresses at all, I'm thinking,\" exclaimed Mrs. Jennings, \"if you spend all your time in examining people's thing. ' The young lady in question, therefore held her tongue, and continued with her work. 41 Now, then, Miss Morgan, hav'n't you finished collecting yet .'\" demanded Mrs. Jennings. \" Yes, ma'am..\" returned that young lady. 41 That's right ; hand it over to me,\" continued Mrs. J enning.s, who forthwith took charge of the pence, and at once left the room. She had not been absent a minute ere she returned, looking as if she were ready to burst with a grand secret, but would rather that that dreumstance did occur, than she should let the secret out, whilst the ladies began to open their littic baskets, aud to seek therein"], [101, "THE DEPARTURE,"], [102, ""], [103, "AtTST SLIEA'S GARkET. 85 for small crusts of bread. It was surprising the number of \" kissing crusts\" that were produeed. Presently a tapping was heard at the door. Mrs. Jones opened it, just wide enough to admit of her nose and band being thrust between it and the post ; and when the door was again closed, she hddin her hand a decanter full of a colourless liquid. \" Now, then, ladies, here's the Jackey,\" exclaimed Mrs. Jennings, putting the decanter on the table and producing from a drawer a wine glass with the foot broken off. She then filled the glass with the Jackey, and aster giving expression to the words \" here's luck, and may wors never fail,\" she swallowed the contents of the glass as if it were only water. \" Ah ! that does one good. Now, then, Mrs. Pratt, you're the youngest comer, it is your turn now, and then the eldest,\" and Mrs. Jennings filled up the glass again. \" I would rather not have any,\" returned Aunt Eliza, \" I am not osed to it.\" \"Oh, nonsense!\" exclaimed Mrs. Jennings, \"if you are going to work for a living, you must drink a little. You'll never get on if you don't.\" \" Still I would rather not,\" returned Aunt Eliza. \" Pooh, pooh ! we take no refusals here. You're ill and almost exhausted ; if you don't take some you will have to go home, and my work will not be done. Just try it ; you will find it strengthen you and give you nerve to get on.\" Aunt Eliza at length yielded, and after two attempts swallowed the liquid. It was the first time she had partaken of raw spirits. She felt afterwards as if she had swallowed strength, and for the rest of the day she worked on with pleasure. The evil of a first drop is, that feeling of strength which it bestows. It is then sought after as the remedy for debility, until, at length, it produces a greater evil, and an incurable habit. It is, therefore, by no means au uncommon fact that sempstresses become gin drinkers. And who can wonder at it ? There is always a demand on the system for renewed energy, and if it cannot be supplied naturally, it must be done by artificial means. It almost seems to be an act of providence ; for what would their sufferings be without it ? It lulls their mental pain, stimulates their nerves, and adds no mean impulse to their downward course to the grave, where it is to be hoped they will find that peace which is denied them while living. We are, however, not of that class who uphold the drinking customs of England, although we do believe that all things are as they should be for the age we live in, though not what they will be. Nor do we quite approve of the assertion that those drinking customs are the ruin of England. If they be, how is it that England is in so o"], [104, "86 ,__\u2022.._ eliza's garret. prosperous a condition ? There are many, no doubt, who suffer, but the greater portion of the population must be of the temperate class. If facts were contrary to this, England as a nation would sink in its prosperity, and those who do fall, fall that the deserving may rise. Nor is this unjust. It is a universal rule, and, therefore, proper for the age we live in. The very circumstance of the fact of there being a class of people styling themselves Teetotallers goes to prove it, because a Teetotaller is the exception to the rule, and not the rule ; when they become the rule, there must be an entire alteration in the system of all things relating to daily life. While Aunt Eliza was, therefore, proceeding on with her work with renewed euergy and spirits, Amelia was wending her way once more to the residence of Mauame Dupont. She did not, however, seek this second interview with that lady with the same earnestness of manner that was visible on the first. There was a cloud upon her brow, and an expression of deep anxiety was visible in her every feature. Her hand trembled, too, as she placed it on the glass handle of Madame Dupont's door, whilst a desire to return home deolining the situation was predominant in her breast ; but, fearful of being laughed at by her brother for not knowing her own mind, she went onward, and at once accepted the situation, binding herself for six months to learn the art and mystery of dress making. How often, if we were to listen to the warning voice that whispers in our ears, and the deep presentiment that seizes upon us and is with difficulty shaken off, might we escape from scenes of wretchedness and misery ; ay, and sometimes guilt. A single step, taken, perchance, against one's wish, or from the fear of being laughed at, is often the forerunner of others that lead one from the path running to prosperity to that, the end of which is bankruptcy . a bankruptcy that robs one of every virtue which, in the heyday of youth began to dawn upon rising manhood, and made one the pride and hope of doting parents; who, if they could look upon their offspring in its fallen state, would weep themselves stone blind with scalding tears, the fruit of bitter disappointment."], [105, "aunt emza's garret. 87 CHAPTER XIV. Some weeks had' past and Aunt Eliza and Amelia were both still employed at their separate places; George, however, had not yet succeeded in obtaining a situation ; his duty, therefore, consisted in minding his little cousin, Joey. They could not afford to pay the landlady anything for looking after him, George was thus, perforce, turned into a \" nurse-maid,\" under the occasional superintendence of Susan Green, or her friend, who had taken part of the room with her. These two young women were always ready to help him when he required it, and to do those little necessary acts which none but a female can properly perform. George, in return for such kindnesses, would take their work into the warehouse, and fetch it for them. They, of course, were aware under what circunistances he had lost his situation, and they felt proud of him as though he were their own brother. A woman can never forgive a man who slanders her chastity, though she may readily pardon the man who becomes her seducer. She will applaud the one who punishes the slanderer, but she will be the first to protect the man who has ruined her. The young girl who had become a sharer of Susan Green's room, obtained her living by making waistcoats. She was one of those hands that work for the large advertising houses. She wa3 a younger sister. Her father was a journeyman tailor, and lived somewhere in the neighbourhood of Whitechapel. Her mother helped him at his business when there was work to be done ; and when not, he used to turn her on the streets to pick up a living the best way she could. Her eldest sister married a young tailor, and, of course, was a help to him, as she had learned at home the business from her father, who, as soon as the youngest daughter, (the one now living with Susan Green,) became of sufficient age, he wished to thrust upon the streets as he had done her mother, but she refusing, and meeting with some degree of support from her mother, she left her home and went to reside with her married sister. who for a time sheltered her ; but a9 she was compelled to sleep in the same room with the married couple, her sister thought it ad . isabl. for her to seek some other lodging, and the husband at once err: d the thought into execution by expelling her forthwith from his room. Driven thus away from shelter, nothing remained for her but to seek once more her father's residence, or to become a houseless wanderer As 6he was standing in the street pondering over her affairs and crying"], [106, "88 AUNT ELIZA'S GAS-JET. bitterly, Susan, whom she had met on one or two occasions before, came up, aud asked her why she was crying t She at once rdated to her the reason. The end of it was, that Susan offered her a share of her room, which she at once accepted. She soon got work from the house for which her father worked, but though she worked upon the average fifteen hours a day, she could scarcdy earn sufficient to pay her portion of the rent, and to clothe and feed herself. Her dinner consisted of two ounces of meat and a halfpennyworth of bread, some- times in lieu of the bread she had the same amount of potatoes; on high days and holidays, it sometimes consisted of a twopenny pork pie. That was a grand treat, and by no means to be laughed at. The rest of her meals were on the same economical scale, never exceeding in the whole sixpence a day, and that, too, to support a continual labour of nearly fifteen hours' duration. An occasional penny was spent in stimulants. This might shock those who advocate total abstinence, and though they argue that more nutriment is to be found in a penny loaf, just let them ask themselves this simple question \u2014 Is there as much stimulating power? When nature is over taxed, an unnatural strength must be obtained. If they would advance their cause, let them endeavour to improve the condition of these poorly paid workpeople, and until they put them in such a position that they can have sufficient rest and food, it is madness to tdl them that they can do better without those baneful stimulants which make them draw upon their strength, hurrying on mature old age, and at last sending them to their graves, when they should have been enjoying thebuoyancy of their youth. It is folly to say strong drinks create poverty. It is a false idea. That is not the rule, but the exception. It is poverty, hard work, poor pay, scardty of food, and little rest, that is the cause of so much drunkenness. Sixpence a day for food, and that uncertain. It may be earned to day, and not to-morrow. No trust given, or rarely, at the shops, the resource of the poor semptress, and, indeed, the poor of all classes, is then the pawnbrokers. If they have nothing which will be taken as a deposit, what remains for them to do ? Of all evils nature will take the least. These girls follow the example of nature, and when severely driven take the lesser of two evils. They are hungry, and possibly have material to work up for their employer. They feel themselves too weak for the want of food to finish it. There is the workhouse for them to fly to, yet the entiance to that may be denied until the morning or for some hours. What shall they do Becomes then a question of serious import to them. Shall they allow themselves to all but perish for the want of food ? or shall they take"], [107, "tnt eliza's garret. 89 part of the work and pawn it ? so as to enable them to return the re maining part, trusting to chance as to the means by which they shall redeem that which is pledged. Thus, for some time, they go on re deeming and pledging and repledging, until al length comes an un expected stoppage. The means of redemption fails, discovery takes place, and punishment follows with but rare exceptions. Dishonesty is not the intent, at the beginning. It is the impulsive action of the animal to prolong lite. To wish that such beings should prefer star vation rather than borrow \u2014 to use the mildest term\u2014 money on the goods of the man who is getting his ease out of their pain, is, in fact, to wish an impossibility. There may be a few instances on record of some who have been so strietly honest as to prefer death rather than to do that Which the sanctimonious would call dishonest. If they have suffered hunger so much as those who have not been enabled to with stand temptation, they must have been something more than human or mad fanatics. Faith will enable a man to do much ; it will even give hi_n strength to suffer death in a good or conscientious cause, but we cannot with reason expect that a faith based on wrong teaching will enable a man to die by the slow and lingering death of starvation. Surely no man can be guilty of a criminal action, were he driven to such extremes, if he take the first thing offering to save his life. No man ought to allow himself to die when he has the power to prevent it. He is but obeying the impulse of the natural law, and all those itapulfiesare right. To act otherwise, especially when it casts a life away, is more sinful than taking the natural food wherewith to sustain the natural life. We hear and read of people dying in a good eause, and it Is certainly better to do so than to submit to that which is wfbng, Mt to die for want of food when there is abundant in the i and\u2014 when tnen are living upon your dying \u2014 is a mere madman's fanStiefl preaching, and not religion. If this doctrine were not right, would not the number of such martyrs be greater than it is at present? These would not be a day passing but that some person would have \u2022Bed through starvation. The rich, and even the middle classes, chide the poor for want of honesty ; but if they knew them better, and eiamined tifote-lnto their own hearts, they would learn with bitterness thSt there was rhore 'honesty among the poor than among themselves. they etre cheated cruelly ; Worked hard ; paid.badly s treated as if they were not good enough to enjoy the warmth ef the same sun as their flcBer brethre/Bi If en* chance be given, or they are once caught tripping, however slightly, the law is ealled into operation without the slightest mercy ; for, with all our brag, the law is the rich man's luxury and the poor Sian's curs.."], [108, "90 AVVI ELIZA'S 8ARRET. George had become, in the few weeks that be bad been at home fulfilling the duties of nurse, discontented and careless. He bad given up all hope of getting a situation, and the thought that he would ultimately be compelled to take to hawking things in the street began to prey upon his mind. It was the only thing he saw a chance of his being able to do. His aunt and sister were working later than they had hitherto done, for it was with great difficulty that they could make up half the amount that they were now weekly defident, in conse quence of his being unemployed. The effect of so much constant application had begun to tell most fearfully upon his aunt, whilst upon his sister the only difference that could be seen at present was, that the sweet smile which used to con tinually play upon her countenance was now rarely or ever seen, and her voice only heard when giving some necessary direction to George. ere she left in the morning. It was whilst George was busily engaged in winding some silk on a piece of card for his neighbour lodgers and wondering in his mind when he should be more profitably employed, that some one knocked at his door. \" Come in !\" shouted George, thinking it was one of the young women for the silk. The door immediately opened, and Sublimus Quizby strutted into the room, his hands hanging on to his waistcoat, giving the habitual tug. If a certain gentleman, whose name cannot be mentioned to ears polite, had presented himself at the door, George could not have showed more surprise than he did on the present occasion ; perhaps not so much, for some of George's thoughts had been of a rather dark nature. \" You are surprised to see me \u2014 ahem!\" exclaimed Sublimus, \" bat I think I may justly say of myself \u2014 Expers fraudis. Gratia bemtus, and that although amor, et melle, etfelle est faxundissimus, I am still willing to hold out my hand to you and forget the past ; although you have applied a term which no gentleman could well pardon, I am ready to take you by the hand, and exclaim with the author of old, 4 O mihi post nullos Georgi memoranda so dales.' You don't know what that is. Well, then, I will tell you. It means in vulgar English, that you, George, are such a jolly brick, that I will make a memo randum placing you before all my pals. There, that's what it means, and I have come to do it.\" \"And to make more mischief afterwards,\" returned George, who had gone on winding without taking much heed of what Sublimus was saying. \" Ahem \u25a0. You do me wrong,\" exclaimed Sublimus, \" I am truly un-"], [109, "aunt eliza's garret. 91 fortunate in being misunderstood ; my friend, the Mayor of South ampton, suffered from the like misfortune.\" \" Now, if you can oblige me for once,\" returned George, \"do.\" \" I will if I can, certainly ; I came on purpose to do so.\" \" Well, then, if you can, let me know in few words what your busi- ness is in thus coming here?\" \" Vtlis et ad earn rem \u2014 .\" 41 Without the Latin, if you please ; besides, you quote it wrongly, \u2014 there is no 'et.'\" \" You are a Latinist. I was not aware \u2014 .\" \" No I'm not,\" returned George, sharply, \" but though I know nothing about it, I know enough not to make a fool of myself by attempting quotations that every school-boy knows by heart.\" 41 You talk paradoxically.\" \"Do I? then you have the goodness to talk sensibly,\" said George, \" aDd let me know why you are here? If you have come to see my aunt, or my sister, (with a sneer,) they are out, and won't be home until eleven o'clock to-night, at the earliest.\" \" No, I did not come to see them particularly,\" returned Sublimus, \" my business was with you \u2014 ahem !\" \" Oh, it was \u2014 was it ?\" muttered George. \" Yes, 1 came expressly to talk to you \u2014 mini \u2014 .'\u2022 \" Leave the Latin out if you please,\" exclaimed George, \" I'm but a poor fool, and understand only plain, vulgar English. \" You have no soul then for the classics ?\" demanded Sublimus. \" The points \u2014 come to the point, if you please, Mr. Quizby,\" conti nued George, \" not heeding the remark Sublimus had made. Why have you come here ?\" \"You certainly will make a fine man of business,\" said Sublimus, pulling at his waistcoat and pretending to admire George's manner. \"I'm sorry I cannot return the compliment,\" retorted George. \" And so witty, too,\" continued Sublimus, \" that it is quite a pleasure to have to transact business with you \u2014 ahem !\" \" A commodity with which you're not troubled,\" replied George. \" Ahem ! I am sorry to find you so touchy, George, I am indeed, I came hither to see you. Do you take me for a fool \u2014 ?\" \" If you ask me that question seriously,\" exclaimed George, inter rupting Sublimus, \" I must 6ay that I do.\" \"George!\" exclaimed Sublimus, in a pet, \"you're an ass.\" \" What you say is but the braying of one ass to another ; though I don't know,\" continued George, \" but that is paying you a very great compliment.\""], [110, "92 AB_rr slua's oarebt. 44 Come, come!\" exdaimed Sublimus, '4 we shall waste all our time and only aggravate each other.

You have not obtained another situation yet ?\" \"No, I have not,\" returned George, \" I thought so.\" \" Impossible r\" continued George. \" It must be something wonderful for you to think. I should not have given you credit for so much capability.\" 41 Your greatest fault, George, is your wish to be witty \u2014 you're always out of place.

I met him on the first occasion in the Isle of Wight; I recollect the occasion perfectly. But will yon go and see him V \" Perhaps I may,\" returned George, who was wondering why Sublimus had come there to put him in the way of getting a situation. What was his motive? Was it becanse he felt himself to be in the wrong, and that he was anxious to repair in some measure the injury he had done him ? George gave him credit for too much. It was simply that he might have the power of saying \u2014 \" that notwithstanding the manner he treated me, I forgave him, he was but a boy ; and I was really sorry he lost tua place, so I helped him to another. I never bear malice, never.\" 44 Perhaps yon may!\" exdaimed Sublimus. \"Perhaps yon don't think it worth your trouble ?

You have wronged me greatly ; I thought It was a slight recompense for your unjust conduct to me.\" \" I did not come here to discuss old affairs,\" exclaimed Sublimus, and greatly vexed with himself for having done an act of kindness, he strutted out of the room. \" Never mind, old boy,\" muttered George to himself, \" if I can get Susan to mind Joey, I'll go and see this delightful Morsall.\" Susan was only too glad to hear that there was some chance of his getting employment to refuse taking care of Joey ; so George soon cleaned himself and hastened towards Morsall 's printing establishment. CHAPTER XV It was late when Aunt Eliza and Amelia had returned home. They were at work at seven, and neither of theu had left off until eleven at night. Their surprise was great indeed, when Susan told them that Mr. Sublimus Quizby had been there a very long time in the morning, and that as soon as he had left, George came into their room and asked them to take care of Joey, saying he was going out and did not know when he would come home. Susan would not tell them the real state of affairs, because she thought it would be such a delightful surprise to them, if, when George did come home, he could say he had got a situation. She felt rather uneasy in her own mind nevertheless, for it became a wonder to her why he had remained out so late. While Aunt Eliza and Amelia were sitting at the table eating their frugal supper, George was heard ascending the stairs. \" Here he comes!\" exclaimed Amelia and her aunt. In a few seconds George entered the room. A smile was playing on his face, although his cheek was pale, his eye red, and his voice some what hoarse.. \" Here I am, ladies, once more,\" exclaimed George, os he threw off his hat, \" and jolly tired I am, too.\" 41 Why, where have yon been to ?\" eagerly demanded Amelia and her aunt. \" I have been to Screwberry Morsall's,\" returned George, \" and a rum little morsel he is.\" \" Whose Screwberry Morsall ? ' asked Amelia, \" and what is he?\" 41 Well, who he is I don't know ; as to what he is, I should fancy he is a man, but I'm not quite sure whether he is not a vegetable.\""], [113, "AtiHT eliza's oasret. 95 44 Do be serious, George, you have dreadfully frightened us. You should have left word where you were gone,\" exdaimed his aunt. \"Oh, didn't Sukey tell you all about it? Ah, she didn't want to raise your hopes to have 'em thrown down again ; all very proper, no doubt.\" \" Well, what is Mr. Morsall by trade?\" asked Amelia. \" I'll try and relate his various callings. He's first of all a printer and publisher \u2014 he was apprenticed to neither trade I believe, certainly not to printing, he knows nothing about that. He is a temperance lecturer, and a vegetarian advocate. He's editor of a temperance periodical and a vegetarian stamped periodical. He's editor and pro- prietor of a weekly penny periodical for improving the working dasses. He's a doctor on the water-cure system, herbist, and chemist ; lecturer on physiology, astronomy ; in fact, on all ologys, isms, and every available subject on which a lecture can be delivered. He's an independent preacher, secretary to one or two societies besides, and a good many other things I've forgotten. Well, I've made terms with this wonderful man, or rather with his overseer, Mr. Jellybelly, to act as reading boy for five shillings a week. They grumbled rather to give me that, they only wanted to give me four ; but I thought that too little, so I stuck out and got five shillings a week, and was put to work at two o'clock, and have been reading ever since.\" \"Well, thank God for that!\" exclaimed Amelia and her aunt, \" though I wish some one else had told you of it instead of Quizby .\" \" So do I, bnt we can't be always choosers. Now 1 have got it, let me try to keep it.\" \" But what have you been reading?\" demanded Amelia. \" Oh, lots of things, some in print and some in writing ; or, to speak business-like, in manuscript. I read'em to a man they call a reader, he looks over what they call the proof, and marks the mistakes. Oh, some of it is such rubbish. Why, there was one long article I read, which tried to show that people musn't eat beef, and that poor people might live better and have more money to spend for books, (ail the spare money is to go for books, mind,) if tney would live on vegetables. I can't tell you how many different ways they have got for cooking a potatoe. I 6ay, Meeley, what a lot of greens those vegetarians must be\u2014 musn't they T \" I don't know, I'm sure ; they may be right for what I know.\" ' \" Well, they may be. They're going to have a converzatione next Thursday, and nearly all the men are going ; we'll go too, if possible, and hear what they have got to say. I only wonder how he can attend to so many things : that's the puzzler.\""], [114, "96 ac_tt Eliza's garret. \"Yes, if they are properly attended to,\" returned Amelia. \" Has he been long established as apriuter?\" \" Oh, no. He bought the things of a firm that made a smash of it ; and what with his different sodeties' books, he's got a pretty good trade to start upon.\" \" Well, it's better for you than doing nothing,\" continued Amelia ; \" but it strikes me you won't hold the place long.\" \"Why not ?\" 41 Because a man who professes to do so many things, scarcely understanding any one of them, must come to the ground.\" 41 Well, but he's got a little money, I believe,\" returned George. \" The sooner spent.\" \" Oh, I don't know so much about that,\" returned George, \" he's a predous screw, I can tell you. He pays none of the men their proper wages. The work is nearly all done by apprentices, at half the proper price, and the men only get two-thirds. They have got one or two papers, preaching up the rights of working men, praising up Kossuth and the Italians, running down government and all men who don't pay proper wages to their men, and encouraging men in their strikes for more money ; but that makes no difference to him, he pays his workmen only two-thirds their due, and says that that is quite enough for them, for if they live on vegetables they can save money and be better off than those who get the full pay and eat meat.\" \"Then his fall will be the sooner,\" continued Amelia, \" because every one of those employed by him will hate him ; will never work for him when they can get work elsewhere ; will cheat him on every possible occasion \u2014 and no difficult thing to do dther, I should fancy, if he don't understand the trade practically\u2014 besides, they will do their work carelessly, and when too late he will find to his cost that, paying men badly, is the worst of all bad policies ; unless, indeed, one understands the trade, and is a perfect nigger driver, and there are too many of that class in London.\" 41 Why, what a girl you are !\" exclaimed George, \" you see through a thing in a minute. Now I've been thinking about the place all the day, asid you come to conclusions as fast as I tell you the positions, and I havn't come to one of them.\" \"Girls are always said to be more forward than boys,\" returned Amelia, with one of her smiles just lighting up her countenance. \" There appears to be some truth in the assertion,\" muttered George, slightly vexed at himself for his own want of judgment. They soon afterwards separated for the night, and sought the repose they each so much stood in need of. In the morning other arrange*"], [115, "acnt eliza's garret. 97 ments were made, due care being taken of Joey, and all started to their different occupations with lighter hearts than they had done since George left Messrs. Thompson, Hickery and Thompson's employ. At length the evening came on which the vegetarians were to have a tea party, or to use their expression, a converzatione, and George in consequence, as Mr. Morsall said, of being a new hand, had a ticket presented to him. Quite a favour, indeed, for all the others had to purchase their's, and for fear of offending did not like to refuse to buy one, although they would have preferred retaining the tenpence in their own pocket. George, therefore, bought one for his sister, who had obtained a holiday for the occasion. Aunt Eliza could not get one. So at half-past six o'clock George and his sister made their way to a coffee-house in Farringdon Street, and were at once shown into a room capable of holding comfortably about twenty people, but into which were thrust nearly double the number. All the ladies were without bonnets, and Amelia, after having been handed over to the care of Mrs. Morsall \u2014 a lady full of Christian intents, aud whose age, if one may make a guess at a lady's age, was past fifty at the least \u2014 came back to her brother minus her bonnet. Tea was at length com- menced; some, however, of the ladies and gentlemen, who had a desire to go the length of their cable, ate nothing but brown bread aud fruit ; and turning up their vegetarian noses with the greatest contempt both at Souchong and the finest Mocha, drank nothing but water. The uninitiated, however, partook of what is called in domestic circles, \" husband's tea,\" coffee, or chocolate, whichever came first to hand. After a great quantity of cake, compiledon proper vegetarian principles, had been made to vanish from the table, together with various other gluey-looking substances, of which none but vegetarians know about, tbe tea was said to be over, alid the tables were at once tried to be put out of the way. Mr. Morsall was everywhere in the room at almost one and at the same time. The little man seemed quite to enjoy it ; and his long, thin, dry hair \u2014 for it would not have been consistent to have oiled it \u2014 kept flying about, looking very much like the wooden head of a child's doll, with a very rusty-looking wig tacked on to it. The company having, at length, been arranged in the most convenient position, some one rose up, and in a very squeaky voice, \" begged to propose that Mr. Morsall do take the chair.\" When up bobbed another head, and said, in a very mumbling voice, \" that he begged to second that motion.\" But a third, with spectacles, very pale aud thin, rose from his seat and said \u2014 \" Allow me,, ladies and gentlemen, to propose an amendment. Not that I have any disrespect to the friend proposed to fill the chair, or"], [116, "98 AUST ELIZA'S GARRET. to the friend proposing, but that I think, and I think you will think so to, that we, as reformers \u2014 we, who wish to reconstruct society on better and purer foundations and principles than at present con structed, should, on all occasions like the present, throw on one side the usual method and adopt that, which I, for one, think more con genial to our thoughts and actions. I, therefore, beg to propose as an amendment, that instead of Mr. Morsall taking the chair, that Mrs. Morsall shall be solicited to fulfil the duties of lady president.\" This amendment having been unanimously approved of, Mrs. Morsall forthwith proceeded to take the presidential chair. Time was, however, precious, and so to business she went, commeudng at once the fol lowing address: \u2014 \" Friends, I am happy to see you on the present occasion \u2014 .' \"Yes, my deaw, certainly,\" exclaimed Morsall, who kept up a continual run of remarks on his wifc'a speech. \" We have met to-night to talk about vegetarianism \u2014 . \" Yes, deaw,\" from Mr. Morsall. \" Vegetarianism is a great idea \u2014 . \"Yes, deaw.\" \" Vegetarians may be truly considered the poor man's friend \u2014 . \" Yes, deaw.\" \" I've been a vegetarian myself some years \u2014 . \" Yes, deaw.\" 41 There has not been a piece of meat in my house for a long time \u2014 , \" No, deaw.\" \" Nor I don't intend, the Lord helping, that there should be a piece of meat in my house for a long time to come \u2014 .\" \" No, deaw.\" \" I live upon nothing but fruit. We are all frugiberous animals \u2014 . \" Yes, deaw.\" \" I don't know what it is to use a carving knife \u2014 . \" No, deaw.\" \" I have not had a carving knife in my house for a very long time \u2014 \" \"Dear me, no, deaw.\" [With great emphasis.] '- 1 won't have a carving knife \u2014 .\" \" No deaw.\" 41 1 am sure I can't think how men can be so cruel as to kill animals.

I think I shall sit down now and listen to yon.\" \"Yes, deaw,\" from Mr. Morsall, and great cheering from the com pany. The cheering, however, had scarcely subsided, when some one rose from his chair and said :\u2014"], [118, "100 AimT Eliza's garret. \" Lady president, I'm not a vegetarian, and I'm afraid I'm not likdy to become one.

What are we to do for wool and leather ?\" This the gentleman thought a poser, and so at once sat down ; when another gentleman got on his legs, and tried to answer the question by saying : \u2014 \" I am very glad our friend has put this question. It is a new idea : we have never thought of this ; we shall turn our attention to it. The only thing at present that can be used for a substitute is gutta percha. Wools we can do without by using cottons insteiid.\" \" Hear, hear !\" and great cheering, amidst which the gentleman sat down, pulling up his shirt collar as ho did so, as much as to say, I've settled him. The rest of the speeches were all of the same kind ; one gentleman, however, in his address, said : \u2014 \" I'm not quite a vegetarian, I am nearly, and so is all my family. We have but a very small quantity of meat, which none of us eat. I fancy I'm not quite strong enough to do my work on the vegetarian principle \u2014 it may be fancy. I'm a blacksmith by trade, and so, though I don't eat the meat, I have a good pudding made, which with some vegetables, cooked in lots of gravy, affords a tidy meal.\" When the meeting had come to a close, George and his sister were just as far from knowing about the principles of vegetarianism as when they entered. It had, however, been a source of amusement to them both. But George wanted to know too much ; for when Mr. Morsall said \"that meat was nothing more than a chemical production of vege tables, that vegetable product was the fiist thing, and, therefore, it was wise in us to go to vegetables as other peaceful animals did, because they must contain more nutriment than meat, for the reason that meat was secondary and vegetables primary.\" \u2014 George said, with more warmth than wisdom, \" If that is the case, sir, had we better not begin nibbling the earth ? because all vegetables come from the earth ; and as it is as well to go to the first object, we ought certainly to go to the earth and become earth-eaters.\""], [119, ""], [120, ".-CEDE AT THE EAGLE"], [121, "aunt eliza's garret. 101 George thought he had at last come upon an idea, and turned round in the expectation of applause, but he was doomed to disappointment, for some one said the remark was absurd, and Amelia caught hold of his jacket and pulled him back into liis seat, greatly to the annoyance of Master George, who did not admire being thus treated in his maiden speech. CHAPTER XVI. Is a few weeks tho firm in which George was employed failed, and he was once more out of work. Again he employed his time in taking care of little Joey and answering advertisements which appeared in the weekly newspapers. Among the number to which he replied was the following : \u2014 '\u2022 \u00a330,000 IU FIVE YEARS. .<rr.HE ADVERTISER is in possession of tnforina'.ion, by which the original L holder positively accumulated the above sum in the time specified, and which he will forward to any application, enclosing two shillings and sixpence, and a stamped directed envelope. Address, James Standish, Esq. care of Mr. Rodd, Evesham, Worcestershire.\" In a day or two after George had written to Jamts Standish, Esq. he received the following reply : \u2014 \" Take walnuts lit for pickling, bruise them in a mortar till they are a pulp, then squeeze the juice from them. Let it stand and settle a day, then pour off the clear, and to every pint of juice add a pound of anchovies, and one ounce of .halots. Set it over a fire till dissolved, then strain it clear. To a quart put a quarter of an ounce mace, 1 oz. cloves, 1 oz. Jamaica pepper, half-pint white wine vinegar. Let them boil altogether a quarter of an hour, and when cold bottle it. Half-a-hundred of walnuts should make a quart of juice.\" George determined to try, and after a great deal of trouble and privation, he succeeded in raising enough money to start in a very little way, as a \" pickle merchant,\" but after a great deal of labour and anxiety, he discovered that he could not sell any portion of his walnut juice, and that all his labour and money were a dead loss. Yet how many, who are out of work, are led by the hope of making money rapidly, to spend their last few shillings that would have been a real benefit to them, had they been expended j udiciously. 7."], [122, "aunt Eliza's oarret. 102 Weeks past and George answered every advertisement that appeared in the Times, in the hope of getting another situation, but each appli cation was fruitless Aunt Eliza now began to grow weaker every day. Constant application to work was telling dreadfully on her constitution, and although she still continued at her post, she was not able to earn so much as she had hitherto done. Joey, also, had become thin and attenuated: his little face, once round and chubby, was now long, thin, and flabby ; and his little eyes, swimming in rhuem, stood out prominently in their sockets, whilst underneath might ba seen the peculiar mark which children, who have been subjected to frequent doses of laudanum, invariably bear. The various articles of dress, and those little things which, though not actually necessary to us, yet, nevertheless, tend towards our comfort, one by one disappeared, and were handed over to the safe keeping of the pawnbroker. Amelia became more btudious than ever, and frequently when she came home at night her eyes were red with so much toil. She struggled hard with her fate, and no one but herself knew one-tenth part of the sufferings she endured. She was virtuous, for she had been sorely tried, and had resisted victoriously. Though wanting almost the common necessaries of life ; though parting with each article of dress and those little gems of jewellery, gifts of former friends now dead and gone ; though she was thinly dad, and the chilling blasts of winter pierced through her scanty covering, she spurned the offers made her by the sdon of some aristocratic family, or by some old debauchee, of home and plenty, when the price for such was tarnished virtue. Yet all this was kept within her own breast, and though each day brought with it fresh troubles and fresh temptations, she struggled onwards and resisted all. Yet she had not been taught to place reliance on the Almighty for strength and support. She was a stranger to the feelings which fill the breasts of those who nightly bend the knee in prayer and supplication, and have a faith in something spiritual. Yet she had an innate feeling of right and wrong ; and because she believed it was wrong to yield she had resisted. I Bay, therefore, that she was virtuous. George saw how hard the struggle had become, and strove to help tnem in their trials, but still each day came and past without bringing any good to him. It was bitter in the extreme to daily and hourly hope for succour, and yet continually to meet nothing but disappoint ment. All his effort were of no avail. Let him do what he would some other lad succeeded. He had had a friend to speak for him ; George had had none. It was a dull, cold day, and George had been to some house down by the docks, in the hope of, at length, getting a situation, but he was met by the usual answer, \" that since they had"], [123, "AUNT ELIZA'S GARRET. 103 written to him they had engaged with a lad, the parents of whom was known to one of the gentlemen of the firm.\" All was busy round about him, no one appeared to be an idler ; every one seemed to have some calling, he alone was unemployed. As he was standing watching the people hurrying to and fro, passing on from one vessel to another, or from one part of the docks to another, he muttered to himself, \"and I'll do something, too. I'll see if I can turu sailor; if not, I'll enlist, a last resource; but many better than I am have become sailors, or soldiers, aud why should not I ?\" He had no sooner made up his mind than he commenced trying to carry his resolution out. He had not gone many steps before he met a couple of sailors, whom he at once stopped. \" Hi, hi, your honor,\" exclaimed the foremost, as he turned round to George, and at the same time bringing his companion to a stand still. 41 1 want to go to sea,\" exclaimed George ; \" can you tell me how I can get employed on board any of the ships ? I don't care in what capacity so as it's something. I'm strong, hearty, and young ; and what I don't know I'm ready to make up in willingness to learn.\" \"Hi, hi,\" exclaimed the one who had been the first to speak, \"so you want to go aboard, do ye ? Well, I don't know, youngster, but somehow I thinks I can take ye in tow a bit. What d'ye say, Bill '! Think he'll suit the skipper ?\" \" Dock my pigtail if I know,\" returned his companion, turning over his quid. \" S'pose he goes aboard wid us ?\" \"'Shiver my timbers, Bill, if that isn't the right tack. Come, my lad, keep close along side.\" 41 Thank you,\" exclaimed George, and at once followed them, his heart beating high with hope. In about au hour's time George had bound himself to sail in the Mary Ann, of Iondon, then lying in the docks taking in her cargo, and which vessel was bound for Calcutta. As soon as arrangements had been made satisfactorily lo all parties, George returned home with a heavy heart to inform his aunt and sister of the step he had taken. He was not sorry for what he had done, but only for what his aunt and sister might feel at parting from him. \" It will be better for them,\" thought George, as he walked slowly home. \"They may manage to live upon what they earn, and I shall not be a clog upon them. If we can manage to crawl along as it is, it must be lighter for them when I'm away ; it is only for a time after all, and who knows but what I may return rich.\" Thus reasoning to himself he reached home. There was no one to receive him, his aunt and sister being at work. \" Ah ! poor things,\""], [124, "104 aunt eliza's garret. soliloquised George, sinking into a chair and burying his head in bis hands, at the same time trying to keep back the tears which forced themselves between his fingers as they pressed heavily on his eyelids. \"Ah, poor things! They will not have to work so hard when I (am gone. Amelia will not look so pale ; aunt will get better, and so will Joey, bless his little heart! And then, who knows, when I come back, aunt and Meeley may be better off. Perhaps Meeley may be married and will have got a nice, comfortable home, and aunt in a shop doing a snug little business in caps and bonnets, or something of that sort. God send it may be so. What I have done I am sure I have done it for the best. Oh God ! let it turn out so.\" Overcome by his feelings, he rested his head upon the table, and gave vent to the tears he had so long endeavoured to restrain. It was not till after his sister and aunt had finished their scanty evening meal that George gently informed them of the step he had taken. At first they would not believe that he was serious, but when they saw he was not jesting, their grief was bitter indeed. Then came George's greatest difficulty, the persuading his aunt and sister that it was for the best, and that they would not have to work so hard as they had hitherto done. Amelia sat with folded arms, her gaze fixed stedfastly upon the expiring fire. She neither Bpoke nor wept. Her grief was such that it dried up those streams which are given to oool the burning fever of adversity. Not so her aunt ; her tears ran copiously down her cheeks, and her tongue gave expression to words that sounded harsh and uncharitable. There was so much of self in her nature, that she could not at first see the good George really hoped to do them. Hitherto she had felt some degree of comfort and protection in this youth ; but now that he was, of his own accord, severing the link she had clung to \u2014 for she had hoped that he would have got a situation, and by doing so have made their toil less neces sary \u2014 her heart sunk, and she looked upon George's act as being a selfish and au unkind one. Amelia, too full of sorrow to speak, worshipped him in silence. She appreciated his motive, yet at the same time she keenly felt that if he once left her, she would lose her only protector ; for George, though younger than she, was man enough to stand in the defence of both her and her aunt, as his attack on Quizby testifies. \" Well, Meeley,\" said George, after some little pause, \" you have said nothing yet. Have you no kind word for me ? I've acted, as I thought for the best, and at the most I only deserve being chid for not taking your opinion first. Say something to me, Meeley, for I'm very wretched.\""], [125, "AUNT ELIZA'S GARRET. 105 Amelia slowly turned her face towards her brother. Her eyes, dry and glassy, had an expression that was neither wild nor sorrowful, but a blending of the two. Taking his hand between her own, which were burning with fever, she pressed it gently, and in a husky voice said : \u2014 \" God bless you, dear, God bless you !\" She then laid her head upon his shoulder, aud with her parched and burning lips impressed a kiss upou his cheek. \" I think that what you have done was the promptiug of your good, kind heart. You would not have done it, I know, if you had not fancied that aunt and I would have had to work less. It is aunt's sorrow that makes her say what she does. She does not blame you, nor does she, in her heart, think you unkind, But when do you go, dear ? You have not told us that.\" 41 In three weeks,\" returned George. \" Oh, not so 600n as that,\" said Amelia, clinging to her brother. 41 Three weeks, and then to part \u2014 perhaps, for ever!\" \" It had better be even so, Meeley,\" returned George, \" than lingering on, as we have lately done, until death quickly part us beyond the power of meeting again in this world ; for Meeley, yon and aunt \u2014 it is no use your denying it \u2014 are sinking every hour under your troubles. By my going your lives will be saved, and I shall be rewarded, when I return, by seeing both of you in comfortable homes, and then, pos sibly, we may have no more cause to part. But it is late now, and I have to be down at the docks early, so let us now go to bed, and ia the morning we shall be able to look at things more calmly.\" Little more was said. At length, after having bidden each other good night, with more affectionate warmth, perhaps, than they had ever done before, they each sought their bed, and tried to forget in sleep the cares that racked their minds. CHAPTER XVII. As George on the following morning was ascending the stairs to his own rooms, on his return from the docks, he saw lying on the floor close to the parlour door, a piece of paper folded like a letter. Curiosity induced him to pick it up, when he immediately recognized tbe writing on it to be Quizby's. He hastened into his own room and eagerly read the contents. The letter was certainly in Quizby's handwriting,"], [126, "106 aunt Eliza's garret. but the name at the bottom was Mr. Stedman's, and the letter itself was addressed to Miss Johnson. George was ptrzzled. It was, in fact, an appointment for Miss Johnson to meet the writer at the Eagle, on the Sunday evening following, at seven o'clock. \"I have it,\" exclaimed George, at length, \" Quizby is carrying on an intrigue here, and is going in Stedman's name. I wonder if the letter was sent here, or left at some other place ; but there, that's of little consequence. It's my turn to have some fun, the game's been his all along ; now here's a chance to turn the tables if I only knew how. I'll have a try, so here goes, and if I don't pay him off for the trick he Berved me my name is not George Pratt. He at once sat down and wrote a letter to Mrs. Quizby, imitating as well as he possibly could the writing of a young lady poorly educated, in the following words : \u2014 \" Madam : \u2014 For some time past I have been receiving the addresses of a gentleman who has passed himself off to me as a Mr. Stedman. This cruel man, I have reason to believe, is married, and is your husband, and that his name is not Stedman at all. Now, ma'am, you will see by this letter I send you, that be wants me to meet him at the Eagle, next Sunday evening. I should be very sorry to C3use you any sorrow, but if you would only come there, and if so be it is your husband, meet him face to face. By so doing you will ease a poor, distracted girl of the doubts which are destroying her health, and make her at once to know her cruel fate or happy destiny. I leave every thing to your judgment ; but, oh, as you are a woman, do oblige me in what I ask. \" I am, '\u2022 My dear Madam, 44 Yours in doubt and sorrow, 41 C. Johnson.\" 41 There, I think that's ahout the style of a domestic heroine, very virtuous and all that sort of thing.\" Thus soliloquizing, he folded up the epistle, taking care that the letter addressed to Miss Johnson was safely enclosed. He then hurried up to Islington to deliver it. Having arrived at Quizby's shop he peeped in, and seeing a lady weighing some tobacco for a customer, he immediately presumed that she was the party who had done Quizby the honour to take his name. After the customer had left George entered. \" Am I addressing Mrs. Quixby ?\" he asked. \" My name is Quizby,\" answered the lady. \u2022 Thank you. I am desired,\" continued George, \"by a young lady who is a great friend of my sister's, to deliver this letter to you personally, and to beg your careful perusal of it.\""], [127, "aunt Eliza's gaeret. 107 \"And who is your sister, young man?\" demanded Mrs. Quizby, authoritatively. 41 1 do not think you know her,\" replied George , \" but the party who has written that letter is an orphan. [George spoke the truth.] I have acted merely as a brother in the matter ; the letter will explain the rest. Good day.\" So saying, George walked out of the shop, leaving Mrs. Quizby staring at the letter in great ama_, ;ment. At breakfast on Sunday morning, George said to his aunt and sister, \u2022' I premise myself a treat this afternoon, if I never have another during my life. Will both of you go and ecijoy it with me ?\" \"Of course,\" replied Amelia, \"we should not like to be separated more than we are actually obliged, and if we can enjoy any pleasure with you, I'm sure aunt aud I would be glad to do so.\" \"Very well,\" returned George, who then related to them hosv he hoped to punish Quizby for his slander upon them. \" So,\" continued he, \" we will have an early tea, walk up to the Eagle, and watch for the fun.\" \" But you do not know whether Miss Johnson will go to meet him,\" said Amelia. \" Ah, I never thought of that !\" exclaimed George. \" If she don't go the fun will be nowhere, and we must have it somehow.\" 41 Nor do you know whether Mrs. Quizby will be there,\" continued Amelia, \"You have not managed the affair at all well.\" \" Oh, she is sure to come,\" said George, looking very disappointed, for he began to fear that his little plan would come to nothing. \"Well, never mind, dear,\" said Amelia, observing the falling of George's countenance. \" I'll go aud see if Miss Johnson is going.\" \"Why, what are you going to do ?\" demanded George, as his sister rose from her seat and hastened to the door. \" You surely will not ask her if she is going to the Eagle, that would make her suspect something directly.\" \" Ah, George,\" replied Amelia, \" you little know how we can find out anything we want to know. Best assured I shall obtain enough information to warrant us in forming a pretty accurate notion whether she is going or not, without in the least creating suspicion.\" \" Well, I only hope it will turn out as you wish,\" said Aunt Eliza, when Amelia had left the room. \" Nothing would please me more than to see him placed in _. ridiculous position. Tho only circumstance that I am sorry for is, that his wife knows about it. I wiBh, for her sake you had thought of some other plan ; for if she be fond of him, it"], [128, "108 aunt kliza's garret. may be a source of secret unhappiness to her all her life. I judge from myself. If I had known your dear uncle to have past himself off as a single man to a single woman, I shonld never have forgotten it, though I might have forgiven him.\" \" Ah, I did not think of that,\" said George, rather sorrowfully ; \" but there, it's done now and it can't be helped.\" \" She's going,\" exdaimed Amelia, entering the room. \" So far your scheme goes on well ; I hope it will finish in the same manner.\" \" But how are we to get in ?\" asked Aunt Eliza. \" We have scarcely enough money to carry us three days into the week.\" \" Oh, I have got some,\" returned George. \" I obtained a loan from Mr. Godfrey, or rather, he insisted on my taking it, and I have made arrangements for Meeley to receive half my pay while I'm away. It won't be much certainly, but every little helps you know.\" \"God bless you, dear!\" exclaimed Amelia, kissing her brother, \" what a dear, thoughtful creature you are. Is be not, aunt?\" \" Yes, he is like his uncle, all the world over,\" replied her aunt, bursting into tears ; \" always thinking of everybody else before himself and always suffering for everybody else.\" \" Ah, what a shocking bad job that is,\" returned George, trying to look cheerful and to be merry. ,4Im sure you're not paying me a compliment when you say I'm like uncle, I hate copyists, I like to be an original.\" \"So you are, George,\" said Amelia, \"but we can't talk about that now, let us set about cooking the dinner.\" \" Ah, that's right,\" exclaimed George, \" and Joey and I will baste the meat, while you do the rest.\" Baste the meat ! what a conceit some people have ! How grand they are \u2014 in sound. Oh, George, a joint of meat under a tea cup ! \" Yes, and burn it,\" said Amelia.\" \" If I do, may the sop in the pan I mean to have make me horribly bilious, that's all.\" And thus the day was passed in continual struggles to appear cheerful, and to repress the tears that, every now and then would force themselves into their eyes. At length the time arrived when they were to start for the Eagle. With great anticipations as to the results of George's scheme they arrived at that celebrated place of amusement, dedicated, not to sweet sounds and rapturous harmony, but to screaming discord, and to vile chemical concoctions called spirits. Where the morals of hundreds of our rising youths receive their first blemish ; where the music of the best masters is nightly murdered ; where ballet is rendered ridiculous"], [129, "aunt eliza's garret. 109 and disgusting ; and where Venus, inebriated, reels about in the embrace of youth untimely weaned from the maternal care. They had not been long in the grounds before they saw Sublimus and Miss Johnson enter, and ultimately proceed to one of the arbors which the proprietor has taken care to supply for all loving couples who aro anxious to have an uninterrupted t.te-_.-t_te. George imme diately led his aunt and sister into the one adjoining, and there retiring into the darkest corner, sat anxiously waiting the result. Presently a lady closely veiled came to the same arbo.- in which George was seated. Her attention was too much engaged to notice him or his aunt and sister. Sublimus called out to the waiter to bring him some wine. \" Wine, indeed !\" muttered the veiled lady, drawing the veil tighter over her bonnet and thrusting her head a little more forward. \"And now, adored one,\" continued Sublimus, \" tell me how it was you did not meet me as proposed ?\" \" I had not, the means of returning your kindness,\" answered Miss Johnson. \" Oh, why think of that ? I am not so sordid as that, I only ask your love.\" \" Very fine, indeed !\" muttered the veiled lady, evidently getting more uneasy. \"You certainly have given me reason to love you,\" returned Miss Johnson; \"your kindness alone saved me from the broker and the street.\" At this moment the waiter arrived with the wine. \"Ah, the wine!\" exclaimed Sublimus. \"By heaven! we will enjoy ourselves to-night. I have made up my mind to do so. Then fill high the sparkling goblet and drink deep. Wine, fit drink for Gods, I adore thee ! Thou art speeretualecty embodied ; thou givest to the tcemid, courage ; and to the bold, tenderness and love. Thou fillest the breast with admiration for the beautiful, making even the man of ice warm with passion's heavenly flame. Oh, then, let me in this cup pledge thee, my charmer !\" \u2014 ['\u2022 The fool !\" was Miss Johnson's re flections\u2014and as readily as I quaff this heavenly draught, so may I fold thee in love's embrace. One kiss.\" \" Oh, fie!\" exclaimed Miss Johnson, \" what would your wife say V \" Why continually talk to me of such a person ? Cannot I persuade you that that lady is a myth at present ?\" 41 1 don't care what he says,\" thought Miss Johnson, \" he is married I know, be has all the appearance of a married man.\" Then continuing"], [130, "110 aunt eliza's garret. aloud : \u2014 \" If I could only believe that you were single I Something whispers me you are not free.\" \" Not free! I'm free as air. I'm free to .' 44 To help me to a glass of wine!'' exclaimed the lady seated at the mouth of the next arbor, throwing up her veil. \"Good God!\" exclaimed Sublimus, in amazement, letting fall the glass he bad in his hand. \" And so you are free, are you ?\" continued Mrs. Quizby, whose pent up passion began to flow in an overwhelming torrent. \" And who pray, Mr. Sublimus Quizby, am I ?\" \"My dear \" \" Answer me, you brute ! Who am I ? Am I, or am I not, your lawful wedded wife ?\" \" My dear, remember \" Don't dear me, you cruel villain !\" 44 My dear, I won't.\" \" Go it, old woman !\" exclaimed a fast young man with two or three straggling hairs upon his chin, which he bad the impudence to call an imperial. \"The naughty man to come ont a courting, leaving his lady-wife at home. Oh, oh, it's kivite .-hocking!' \" Ah, what Quizby '. Is that you ?\" exclaimed George, coming forward. \" How d'ye do ? Out upon the spree !\" \" Why, yes, I've just stepped out for a stroll, and as this young lady accosted me, I thought I would have an innocent jest \u2014 quite an innocent one, I assure you,\" was Quizby's reply. \"Jest! do you call it?\" exclaimed Miss Johnson, affecting the virtuous. \" So, after playing with my affections all this time, you can turn round in this cowardly manner and call it a jest. Oh, my dear Mrs. Pratt,\" continued Miss Johnson, addressing that lady, \" this man has promised to marry me \u2014 actually given me the money to buy the ring and some furniture \u2014 and now he turns out to be already married. Thank God you are here, I need a friend, truly.\" \" Dear me, what a string of untruths that woman has uttered !\" said Quizby, in a tone of injured innocence, accompanied by the usual tug at the waistcoat. \" It is. true !\" shrieked Mrs. Quizby in the true Caudle style. \" Why the young lady wrote to me herself, and told me her doubts that Mr. Stedman and Mr. Quizby were one and the same man, and I came here to settle my doubts and hers too. Oh, dear, to think that, after all I have done for you, you would go and leave me for another in this manner. Oh, you cruel, cruel brute!\""], [131, "aunt eliza's garret. 111 Upon Miss Johnson hearing that she had written to Mrs. Quizby, she immediately suspected some trick had been played upon Quizby, and as she had by that circumstance been found out, and her hope of getting more money out of the fool by promising compliance to his wishes \u2014 yet for ever putting him off upon some pretence\u2014 destroyed, she determined to make the best of the matter ; not that she cared much about it, her only regret being that she had so soon lost such an easy fool, who could be so readily plucked. 41 Oh, oh, what a very naughty man !\" exclaimed the fast gent., puffing away at something he called a cigar. \" Take him home, ma'am, take him home and whip him well, the naughty man.\" \" What business is it of yours ?\" asked Mrs. Quizby, sharply, of the fast gent. \" I think you had better go home to your mother, she can't know of your monkey tricks, I'm sure.\" \" You're quite mistaken, my dear, you are, indeed. My mother, I do assure you, knows I'm out. She gave me sixpence to spend, and told me not to make a beast of myself. Oh, crikey, don't I love my mother ! You may have it, my angel, to buy a rod with to tickle the toby of that very naughty man, if you'll only condescend to give me a buss.\" The fast gents who had assembled round the spot shouted with laughter, while some said it was \" dimmed fine, vastly witty,\" and used many other expressions of the like nature. \" If you dare insult my wife, young man, I shall chastise you '.\" exclaimed Sublimus, hoping by showing a brave deportment to pacify the auger of his wife. \" I shall indeed, sir \u2014 ahem !\" As he gave utterance to this threat, he drew himself up to his greatest height, and tried to look very indignant indeed. \" Oh, my heye, here's a wery virtuous, indignant covey ! Oh, Lord ! who'd a thort it ? Caught a kissing another gal and his old 'ooman looking on. Oh, you naughty man, you make me blush '\" Again the bystanders burst into laughter. \" I dessay,\" added the would-be-facetious gent, \" he had the owdasseety to want a latch key.\" Then calling to his companion who was a little distance from him : \" I say, Tom, here's a row !\" \"I think, ma'am,\" said George, in an under tone, to Mrs. Quizby, \" the sooner you retire the better, or you will have a crowd round you, a circumstance not very desirable.\" \" Oh, by all means,\" from the fast gent, who had heard George's advice, \" take him home. If he's werry obstreperous I'll lend you a hand.\" Mrs. Quizby thought George's advice the best she could follow ; so"], [132, "112 aunt eliza's garret. catching hold of her loving husband's arm, she pulled him bon gr_ malgr* out of the place. George, his aunt, sister, and Miss Johnson, followed their example and returned home ; Miss Johnson taking par ticular pains to explain the matter to them, so as to justify her conduct in their eyes, of which justification we have little to do, except, indeed, that she wondered who had written the letter to his wife, for she candidly confessed that she had not done it. By the time, however, that they had arrived at their place of residence, they were laughing heartily at the termination of the affair, Miss Johnson pretending to be very glad it had ended as it had, on account of Quizby's conduct to George, and certainly she enjoyed seeing the ridiculous figure Quizby appeared when his wife made herself known. CHAPTER XVIII. The day at length arrived when George must part from his only friends, his aunt and sister. His little outfit had been already con veyed on board the vessel, which had during the night dropped down the river as far as Gravesend. The sun was shining as brightly as it was possible for a London sun to shine, and the atmosphere, as an exception to the rule, was clear and healthy. Annt Eliza and Amelia had obtained a few hours leave of absence for the purpose of seeing George off. They were preparing for the last time his breakfast, the last meal, possibly, of which they might partake together. His aunt was crying bitterly ; though we rather think his sister showed the most affection by her quiet grief, and great anxiety to make that last meal as comfortable and as good as it was in her power to do. She shed no tear, yet continued to hover near him, watching his every look and trying to anticipate his slightest want. On the table there w as a small cake, made by her own hands, already packed up for him to carry with him ; also a little case, tastefully embroidered by herself, filled with pins, needleB, and all sorts of threads, not valuable in itself, perhaps, but, oh, the pain it had cost her heart when she was making it. If we wish to know by whom we are loved, let us look at those gifts, trivial in themselves, which have been given with the heart's wish that they will keep the giver in remembrance, gifts that have"], [133, "aunt eliza's garret. 113 been given in utter abandonment of sdf, but with the fervent hope that they might please the receiver, or relieve some heart-felt pang ; and also, where we find those gists retained with a religious care ; looked upon with sacred feelings which remind one of moments that have been passed in the society of those one loves, and thus making one in the imagination live those moments of the past again. Where we see this we may rest assured that, both giver and receiver are loved, the one by the other. Amelia had also bought him a pearl edition of the Bible, and his aunt had, with much privation, redeemed his uncle's silver hunting watch, which luckily had not been pawned for much, and had presented it to him with a narrow silk ribbon attached to it by way of a guard, having the names of his aunt and sister embroidered thereon with the hair of both of them. George loved his aunt, but he worshipped his sister, and as he looked upon her pale and tearless face, he began to regret the step he had taken. It was, however, too late for repentance. Go he must, and with a fervent prayer that he might be supported in his duty, he rose from the breakfast table. 44 We have no time to lose,\" he said, \" tha boat starts at 'nine, and, I, as well as one or two more of the crew, shall be looked for by it. So, Meeley, if I wish to get on, I must not appear to be an idler.\" \" You have scarcely eaten anything,\" returned his sister. \" Do eat some more.\" \" No more, thank you. If I always succeed in getting such a meal I shall be lucky. Now, then, put on your things and walk down with me to the wharf. I wish you could go with me as far as Gravesend, but as you can't, it may be for the best.\" \" You seem to fancy that everything is for the best,\" said his aunt, sobbing. 41 It is only that thought which enables me to bear this separation,\" George replied, turning away and hastily brushing the tears out of his eyes. \" Everything is for the best, only we don't know it.\" In a few minutes they were in the street and on their way to London Bridge. The three of them tried to be as cheerful as possible. George and his aunt talked as fast as their tongues could give utterance, scarcely knowing what they said, or even caring, so long as it kept their thoughts from the one great fact. Amelia scarcely spoke a word, though her aunt used all her power to make things cheerful, and would insist upon looking into the shops, pointing out the different dresses she would like to have, and those she would like to give Amelia ; then picturing how, when George came back, they would live, if all went right, and what pleasures they should have, as recompense for their trials and troubles."], [134, "114 aunt eliza's garret. A short silence and more tears. Close to the Mansion-house they met Mr. Godfrey, who stopped and bade George farewell with the warmth of a friend, gave him good wishes and offers of assistance, if it lay in his power, to his aunt and sister. Again they started. With forced laughter, tears, and jests that were pointless, they arrived at the wharf as the lioat was preparing to start. Then there was the hurried farewell embrace, the wish to speak a volume in a second, and to breathe innumerable blessings on each other's head. Then was heard the full, rough tone of the captain of the boat as he shouted \u2014 \" Now, then, sir, if you please, times up!\" sending a chill through every artery, checking the heart's pulsation, and stilling the power of speech. Then, the last hurried Kiss and \" God bless you !\" The hurried leap on board as the boat began to leave the wharf; the Btraining of the eye to catch the last, short glimpse of the waving hand as the boat wound round the vessels lying at anchor and thus was lost to sight. Then came a forgetfulness of time and place, a sinking down upon the damp, cold steps, the giving vent to the tong pent-up tears \u2014 hot, scalding tears, that to the hopeless heart gave no relief, but rather for the time added bitterness to its crushing wo. CHAPTER XIX. George had been gone a month, and had written once to his aunt and sister. How glad soever we may be to hear from absent friends, a letter frequently tends but to open the wound that was beginning to heal. So with Amelia and her aunt. They were beginning to be reconciled to George's absence when his letter recalled their parting scene, and made them more painfully conscious of their loneliness. Time continued in its upward flight, and the term which Amelia had to serve expired. She had looked forward with great anxiety to the day that would make her free. The hope that she would be retained in the establishment of Madame Dupont but added to her anxiety, and when she found that she was allowed to continue, and that too, at increased pay, the ever upholding angel, Hope, with her bright wings iluttered for a moment near her, dispelling the thick gloom that sur rounded her. Alas ! it was but for a moment, a sudden brightness that rendered the prevailing darkness of her life more sensibly visible."], [135, "aunt Eliza's garret. 115 Directly work began to grow a little slack, Madame Dupont called Amelia into her private room, and informed her \" that she had not enough employment for so many hands, and that, as she was the youngest, she must, of course, give way to the others. If I should get busy again and want another hand. I shall have much pleasure in taking you on again. Until it does, there remains no alteruative but for you to seek employment elsewhere.\" This came so suddenly and unexpectedly upon Amelia, that for some time she could scarcely believe that she had heard aright, but when the truth did make itself plain to her, she said: \u2014 \" You promised, madam, to retain me in preference to any one else.\" \" So I will when I have work to give.\" \" There appears to me to be but little cessation in the amount of work, of the two we are rather busier than we were this season last year,\" replied Amelia. \" You have heard what I have said,\" continued Madame Dupont, \" I do not condescend to enter into discussions with a parcel of work girls. Good morning.\" Amelia made no reply to this last sentence of Madame's, but bowed and lest the room. Thus was Amelia treated for months of labour. True she had been paid the sum agreed upon, and the legal contract had been fulfilled. But who had been more persevering than Amelia ? No one had been more willing than she had been when Madame had been pushed for time to get her work completed, to toil night after night to please her and to prevent her losing a customer. The workers had hinted to her that the more she worked the more she might, she would only get served as others had been served before, turned off as soon as madame could get another hand that would be likely to do the work at half the price. Amelia had hoped differently, but the truth of what had been told her was now verified. Amelia thought, and with some degree of reason and justness, that by such attention to work she should ensure the respect of Madame, and, of course, coustant work ; but justice too frequently vanishes before the all-powerful influence of pounds, shillings and pence. Amelia proceeded directly to tbe apartment appropriated for the workers to dress in. After putting on her bonnet and shawl she went into the work-room, bade her companions good morning, and left the place. On her way home she saw fixed up in the old place another of Madame Dupont's hand-bills, advertising her want of an improver and an apprentice. \" Well,\" thought Amelia, \" I am more than ever convinced that"], [136, "116 ai'm eliza's u..i.ret. what I was told was true. She is not so busy now but what she can d o without me, and by the time the busy season commences, she to get two hands that she can do what she pleases with. Well, never mind, I've learnt a trade, that's something; perhap able to get work on my own account. I'll try. ForweekB Amelia went out, day after day, in search of work, but constant work was not to be had. Although the greengrocer next door to her allowed her to have a hand-bill fixed upon his door-post, and tbe baker one in his window, she had only received one dress to make up, and as the circumstances were somewhat peculiar, we will relate the faet. The woman who condescended to patronize Amelia was a class leader of the Wesleyan persuasion, who made it a principle to give liberally towards the support of any society started under the care of that body. The price Amelia asked for making the dress was half-a crown, but that was a sum so exhorbitant that the saint could not think of paying it. \" I'm too poor to pay that price. I will give you a shilling, I can't afford more. You see it comes out of the little I can manage to save from housekeeping. I don't care much about the dress, and if you won't do it for that I can't have it done.\" \" I'll do it for two shillings,\" returned Amelia. \" I can't afford to give more than one. I want all my money for charitable societies that I belong to, or I might offer you more. I can't afford it, indeed I can't. You seem to be very poor, I should fancy it would be a charity to you to do it at any price.\" \"Indeed, ma'am,\" returned Amelia, somewhat indignantly, \"it seems to me as if we differed in onr understanding of the word charity. I was not aware that charity consisted in refusing people their reason able remuneration, for the sake of giving it to the support of some whim.\" \" Ah !\" dghed the would-be customer, \" I see you are not converted from the world. I'm not surprised or offended at your language, for you are of the world, worldly. I wish I could give you your price ; but, look yon here now, I belong to a babies' linen society \u2014 or, as my husband impiously calls it, a sewing club ; a bad man, miss, a very bad man \u2014 there's sixpence wanted for that, and I never like to be a defaulter. Then again you see the ladies meet at my house the day after to-morrow to tea, and so forth. Well, that's a great expense ; and my husband is so stingy and close, that I'm sure I shan't have any peace for the next month to come ; but, there, it's in the cause of the Lord that I suffer, und my reward will come hereafter. Then \u2666"], [137, "aunt eliza's garret. 117 to-morrow we have a love-feast, and I must give something there, for you see we're obliged to support our own church, we have no church-rates to support us ; there's nothing like the voluntary system, take my word for it, and 1 can't think, on such an occasion as that, to give less than sixpence. It would look mean ; and there's my friend, Mrs. Williams, she never gives less than half-a-crown ; but then she ought to be thankful and give freely, for her husband is a dear, good man, so zealous in the cause. Then there's to be a Missionary meeting at the City Boad Chapel, the Lord Mayor in the chair, I must put sixpence in tbe plate there ; in fact, I always make it a practice to give in sixpences ; I wish everybody followed my example. So you see, miss, you can have no idea of the many ways I have for my money, and I save it all out of the housekeeping money my husband allows me. I only wish my husband loved the Lord as I do, he would not be so much against all my religious movements ; but the Lord is pleased to afflict his chosen people, and that is my affliction, and a sore affliction it is, bat the Lord in his mercy gives me strength to support it, though 1 sometimes fear I am ready to murmur at his will. Now, miss, after having been so candid with you, \u2014 and candour is, perhaps, one of my greatest failings \u2014 do you think I can afford to give you more than a shilling ?\" Amelia sat with patience listening to the volubility of the woman before her \u2014 it was with a strong effort she refrained from expressing the contempt she entertained for her \u2014 quietly wondering within herself whether the woman ever for a moment asked herself the question \"whether it were honest to appropriate the money her husband had given her for housekeeping to any other purpose than that for which it was intended? And whether it were also honest to endeavour to get work done at less than one-half the proper price for the sake of appearing liberal and charitable.\" \" It is a very low sum you offer,\" Amelia said, at length. \" I dare say it is, but I really can't afford more now, some other time I may be able to make it up ; besides, I ha. . many friends, and I can recommend you to them, so if I don't pay uiie way I'll try and make it up another. And another thing, you should come among us ; you would find we should be glad to receive you, and the Lord is sure to feed his sheep ; only put your trust in him.\" Amelia was anxious to get a connexion of her own, and thinking that if she obtained one customer another might follow, she reluctantly agreed to do it for the money. She did do it, took it home, was kept three weeks for the money, and then only obtained k by applying to the husband, who, on paying"], [138, "118 aunt eliza's garret. her, slipped into her hand a h.df-a-crown, and told her to never mind the change. \"But, sir -' \" Yes, yes, I know, you were ground down to a shilling, kept three weeks without your money, and have come half-a-dozen times for it. J know, it's all right. My good lady has strange ideas, but you'll find that all right. Good day.\" And the little, bustling, man turned round and left the shop. It was the only dress Amelia ever made for that would-be saint, or through her interest. Aunt Eliza still grew weaker and weaker, until, at length, she was compelled to leave her situation in Newgate Street. Mrs. Jennings, for whom she worked, was Kind to her notwithstanding, and allowed Amelia to take her aunt's place, who, being a good hand at her needle, soon succeeded in gaining the good graces of her employer, who wag, altogether, rather difficult to please, besides being incliued to the tyrannical. It was, however, a hard matter for Amelia to earn suf ficient money to pay tbe rent, and to find herself, her aunt, and Joey in food. Frequently she went with but one meal a day, in order that her aunt might have nourishing food to restore her. At length, being completely without money, the shut-up bedstead in which George used to sleep and the furniture of one of the rooms were sold ; and to reduce the rent they induced the landlady to take one room off their hands. With this little ready money Aunt Eliza purchased such restorative* as the chemist advised her to take. These, with the rest she now enjoyed, partially restored her, and once more she was enabled to do a little ; but Mrs. Jennings did not always have enough to employ both Amelia and her annt, she, therefore, retained one of them con stantly; giving Amelia the preference. Aunt Eliza, at length, obtained embroidery to do at home, but the prices became worse and worse ; it, therefore, required increased application to- earn, daily, a sufficient amount to meet the day's ex pence-. Night after night the sick woman toiled, but yet with each new effort, with each succeeding struggle against the mighty wo that pressed upoD her, crushing her very heart, she seemed but to add weakness to her trembling and failing limbs. Often did she contrast Miss Johnson with herself. Even tbe two girls, her neighbours in the next room, seemed to be happier than she was. They could clothe themselves, yet worked not one-tenth part so hard as she did. They could go out and have some kind of recreation, but she could not. How was this ? She dared not, even to herself, give expression to the dou'.ts and suspicions that haunted her, but with a shudder she covered"], [139, "aunt eliza's garret. 119 her Tace with her hands, and in the agony of her troubled mind ex daimed, \" Oh, God ! keep me from this.\" It was late in the afternoon, and Aunt Eliza was working with more than her usual diligence, her little Joey was sleeping by her side, all bis things, except those he was wearing, had been pawned one after the other. His mother was trying to earn enough to redeem some of them. She did not care so much for her own things, but she could not bare to see her child half clad. When she looked at other children in the streets and saw how well -dressed they were, it sent a bitter pang through her heart as she compared them with her own poor child at home \u2014 that child her husband was so proud of. For this purpose, therefore, she worked on, stich after stich, with almost the rapidity of lightning. Hour after hour flew past, and still the mother sat deep into the silent hours of night. Stitch, stitch, stitch, the thin, blue lingers continued in their work \u2014 to her, a work of love. And though the breath grew short and quick, the eye glassy and dim, the cheek pale and worn, yet it was 3titch, stitch, stitch, and still that day's task remained unfinished. Stitch, stidch, stitch, with aching heart and throbbing brow, with each succeeding effort growing weaker. Stitch, stitch, stitch, till Hope, man's guiding star, grow* dim, and pitchy night closes on the soul, giving birth to Carelessnes? and Crime. Yet then she hears her boy, grown restless, turning in his bed, and prompted by her love she easts one hasty glance upon him. aud in her heart breathes on his head a blessing ; then, with a renewed strength, the offspring of a mother's love, she struggles on, and the task is finished. Then reeling from her 6eat she falls upon the bed exhausted ; and pressing her hot and feverish lips upon her child's, she mutters a prayer\u2014 maternal love's impulsive offering\u2014 and sinks into a stupor, a short oblivion, kind nature's boon to energies so overtaxed. CHAPTER XX. It was late on the following morning when Aunt Eliza awoke from the stupor \u2014 it would be mockery to call it sleep \u2014 into which she had fallen after hor hard task. Amelia had already risen, and, after having prepared their miserable breakfast, had left home without the knowledge of her aunt. The first sound, of which Aunt Eliza became conscious. was the piteous cry of her boy ; and although she was feverish, ill, aud"], [140, "120 jityr eliza's garret. weak, she immediately rose and attended to the child's wants. Alas! l>oor boy, he had had nothing to eat since the noon of the previous day. While she was engaged in giving him his first meal \u2014 and, perchance, it might be the only meal he would have before night \u2014 she was surprised by the souud of heavy feet ascending the staircase. This was a circumstauce for wonder. No man had ever visited those apartments since Quizby, when he offered George the situation at Screwberry Morsall's. Was it so late that the man, for whom she had worked so hard and long during the previous night, had grown im patient and had sent for tbe work ? In haste she placed her boy in a jit ting position before the flickering sparks, dignified by the name of fire, and began to fold up the embroidered material, ready for the messenger. If she kept him waiting, even for a moment, the insulting language that would be applied to her the next time she presented herself at the warehouse for work, would be more than she would liki. to l.ear. leaving out of the question the danger she ran of being refused work for the next week. It had become quite a settled plan amongst many of these _hen, who live upon human flesh and blood, to suspend tlieir different workpeople as long as they pleased by way of punish ment foi any fancied neglect. If, in such cases, the poor unfortunate sufferer seek employ elsewhere and it should be discovered that she had done so, the chances are that she loses work from both places. Who says that every man, woman or child, is free? Who says that we have no slavery in England? Those who do assort such facts assert that which is not true. No one if free who is depending upon their labour for a living. English slavery has its various classes like the slavery of any other nation, and the most degrading, the hardest worked, the worst paid, and the bast cared for of these classes, is the class that comes under the appel lation of needle-woman. The domestic servant is in comparison a queen to the sempstress. She knows no wants but, of her own creating, lives well, is well clothed, and sleeps nightly upon a comfortable bed ; while the other neither lives well, nor enjoys the benefit of being clad wdl ; nor does she know the comfort of a bed of feathers, but too oftee takes her rest upon the bare boards, covered only by her ragged apparel. True, there are many tyrannical masters and mistresses ; true, there are many servant girls, just bursting into womanhood, hard-worked and poorly-fed \u2014 at which time, i \u25a0 bi ps, the lack of food is a lasting injury to their constitution, by preventing the full develop ment of their muscular system. But this is the exception, not the rule. Poor servants, or rather servant girl6, have poor masters and mistresses, who are compelled to employ some one to attend to the domestic duties"], [141, "ABNT F.llZA's GAEBET. \u25a0121 while they are slaving to get sufficient to keep life within them, the which they would not be able to do without the aid of these servant girls. Aud for the information of those who complain of the badness of servants in general, let us observe, that they become good or bad according to the conduct of their masters or mistresses. Too many are made bad by the petty whims and the mean tyranny of their employers, and are kept so from the fact that it becomes necessary to their comfort that they should be deceitful. How rarely one has occasion to change who knows how to appreciate the conduct of the servant. Years frequently do not part them. The servant saves, looks and is respectable. But for the poor needlewoman there is no chance for her to better her condition. The more liberally educated she isth* more danger she runs of being contaminated. Her pride\u2014 at least that feeling resulting from education \u2014 hastens her downfall. It were far better for a young girl, or widow, suddenly left to tight her way through the world, to seek employment as a domestic servant, than to endeavour to obtain her living by either her needle or by teaching. By either of the last two means she becomes poor aud degraded. The governess aud sempstress are nearly upon a par. The former may. perchance, be better fed while she is employed, but her misery is more refined ; and daily she has to suffer from the tyranny of her employer, from the despotism of children she dare not correct, and from the jealousy of the servants, before whom she feels she ought to be consi dered, though she knows that their wants and comforts would be attended to before her own. She has to dress and act as a lady; and yet, strange as it may seem, this woman of learning to whom the morals of the child are intrusted, too frequently receives a less yearly pittance than a good cook, certainly less than the lady's maid, and less respected. The sempstress dies through want, or becomes polluted. Scorned by all, and that, too, by her own sex, who rather than lend a helping hand to raise, are the first to say the unkind word, and blame the sufferer for those faults that they themselves would have been the first to have committed, had circumstances placed them in the same position as those they shun. Aunt Eliza, however, was mistaken in her surmises. The party who ascended the staircase did not come to her, but to her neighbour, Susan Green. In a few seconds the door was opened, when some one, in a very pompous tone, asked : \u2014 \"Is there a gal living here who works for Driver & Son, the tailors V \" Tes, I do,\" answered Susan Green's fellow lodger, coming forward. The words had scarcely passed her lips when she ejaculated in a some-"], [142, "122 aunt Eliza's garret. what shriller tone, \"Oh, my God! Susan, it's young M r. Driver and a policeman !\" Upon hearing this Aunt Eliza opened her door to see what was the cause of such an intrusion. The first person that met ber gaze was a young man of about two and twenty, most fashionably attired, a\u00bb<l who endeavoured to act the part of a gentleman ; but who, with all his care, carried too many signs of the shop about him to allow of his being taken for what be wished to be considered. It was this youn man who had made the inquiry above quoted, and who boasted of being one of the firm of Driver & Son. 44 Jest exactly so,\" continued young snip. \" I've come for them ther weskits you had out last week.\" \"They ain't quite finished yet,\"returned the young girl, tremulously. \" I'll bring 'em in this afternoon.\" \" Thenkee,\" said young Driver, \" I should be sorry to put you t\u00bb 10 much trouble ; I'll take 'em meself.\" \" But they ain't done, sir,\" repeated the girl, \" Never mind, miss. I'm very sorry to h urry yon, but we ar wanting 'em ; and as I were coming this way, I said I'd fetch 'em. So 'and 'enrover, it won't suit, done or not done. Come, don't keep us waiting, our time's short.\" 41 I havn't got 'em here, sir,\" returned the poor girl, more and mox frightened. 41 Not got 'em here! Why where in the devil's name are they then ?\" demanded the young partner of the respectable firm of Driver __ Son, Merchant tailors, general outfitters, haberdashers, hatters, glovers, shoemakers, hosiers, and a long line of etceteras. \" Please, sir ,\" began the girl. \" Please, sir \u2014 nonsense. Let's have none o' that gammon ; it don't please me. I want our goods. Where are they?\" \" Why, sir, I couldn't do all myself, so \u2014 so I gave some to my sister to help me.\" \"That's a lie. Why not tell tbe truth at once ? You know you've popped 'em. Search the room, and see if you can find the tickets, policeman.\" \" Oh, please don't, sir. Only give me till this afternoon, and I'll bring 'em all in, indeed I will,\" exclaimed the young girl. >' Oh ! that's likely, ain't it ? very '.\" returned the representative ol Driver & Son. \" I wan't 'em now ; very sorry I can't wait. Now, then, constable, do your duty.\" \" Oh ! do, sir ; pray do, sir. I'll bring 'em in, in an hour ; I will, sir, indeed I will ; do wait, sir !\""], [143, ""], [144, "the ei'fe.ts or iLL-rAin labour."], [145, "AUNT ELIZA'S GARRET. 123 \u2022 What are they in for ?\" demanded young Driver. \" Only half-a-crown, sir, that's all ; indeed, sir, that's the truth.\" \" Ah, ah . 1 thought we should get at it at last,\" exclaimed the very respectable citizen (?) with a sneer. \" Out with the duplicates '.\" \" But I'll bring 'cm back, sir, in an hour.\" \" Won't do !\" \" In half-an-hour, sir, indeed I will ; only do look over it this ones, it's the first time.\" \" Won't do !\" \" Half-an-hour, sir, won't make any difference to you, sir.\" 44 Won't it, though ; I know my business best, I fancy.' 14 I'll bring 'em in in a quarter of an hour ; in ten minutes ; only let me off this time !\" \" Cant do it. Sorry I can't oblige you, my dear.\" \" I think, sir,\" exclaimed Aunt Eliza, coming fern ard, \" I think, sir, you might give her the time she asks.\" \" You do \u2014 do yon ?\" exclaimed young snip, \" and what business have you to think at all about the matter, I should iike to know?\" \" It can't do you any good,\" suggested Aunt Eliza, \" giving her into eustody. It will only give you trouble aud expence, and you hear she says she'll bring you your goods in a quarter of an hour.\" \" In teu minutes I will,\" joined in the poor, accused girl. \" Do you think I'm so green as that comes to ? No, no ; old birda are not to be caught with chaws. Give her ten minutes to cut away ' Likely! Isn't it?\" ' \" Well, let some of her friends fetch the goods,\" continued Aunt Eliza, \" while you wait.\" \" I tell you it won't do. We must make an example. We're al way having some of this nonsense, and I mean to put a stop to it. Now, then, out with these duplicates, or we must search.\" \"Then uo it!\" exclaimed the girl accused. \"If you won't have mercy, you may have all the trouble.\" \" I think, for the sake of half-a-crown,\" exclaimed Susan Greeu, \u2022'you might give her the chance of saving herself from prison. I've got two shillings, and I can borrow sixpence down stairs, and that will get 'em out.\" \" I tell ye I shan't do it !\" returned the young man in a rage. \" I'll put a stop to this fun ; one or two examples will do that I fancy. Now, then, constable, havn't you found 'em yet ?\" \" No, sir,\" returned the policeman ; \" but as the young woman has admitted pawning the goods, I think we can take her into custody at \u2022nee. It may save time that way.\""], [146, "124 aunt eliza's garret. \" Oh, very well ; I s'pose you know best,\" replied young Driver. \"I understand, then, that you give this young woman in charge, demanded the constable. \" Certainly.\" \" The brute!\" exclaimed Aunt Eliza and Susan Green together. \"I s'pose you two women have shared in the plunder,\" ejaculated young Driver. \"It's wonderful what a seller feeling prill make one do. I'm not quite sure,\" continued he, pointing to Susan Green, \"whether I ought not to give this gal in charge as well.\" \" I think you bad. better not,\" returned tbe constable. \" And so do I,\" exclaimed Susan. \" Well, p'riaps not ; but they!! both be caught one of these sine days, no doubt. Come, bring her along, I can't lose any more time over the matter.\" So saying he sauntered down stairs, and was soon after followed by the constable and his prisoner, accompanied by Susan Green, who determined to explain to the magistrate how willing they were to give up the things if time were only given. She felt, convinced that the magistrate would release her companion on the goods bdng given up. But she found herself grievously disappointed. A felony had been tommitted, and the magistrate did not dare to compromise the matter, or even hint at such a thing bdng done. The poor girl was __ m by the woman kept for the purpose, and the duplicate found upon her. Everything was too clear to admit of the least doubt, she was, there fore, committed forthwith. 41 I'll let these wretches know,\" exclaimed young Driver as he walked out of the court, \" that I won't put up with these tricks aay longer. Who's to pay for the loss ?\" Truly, Mr. Driver, women should be honest ; and who, as you say, is to pay for the loss one experiences by these petty thefts ? You know, Mr. Driver, we can't be continually having goods pawned by our work girls without endeavouring to put a stop to it. It's all nonsense, Mr. Driver, about their bdng driven to it by want. We pay them what we consider sufficient ; we can't afford to pay them more, or if we did do so, how can we keep our villa just out of town ? How can we have our wine ? How can we keep our blood-horse to bring us up to town and take us back again at night ? How can we clothe our wives and daughters with the elegance of tbe finest ladies in the land ? How can we, in fact, do just what we please, when we please, and where we please, unless we grind these women down in price as low as we possibly can ; eh, Mr. Driver ? We could not do it any other way, could we ? And what care we what people aay,"], [147, "aunt eliza's garret. 125 so long as people buy at a good price what we get made for next to no price at all. So long as we get money, that's everything, Mr. Driver. Is it not ? And so long as these poor women \u2014 I beg your pardon, Mr. Driver, \u2014 \"these wretches\" attempt to pawn our goods, we must try and stop it ; but, of course, we couldn't think of giving them better pay, because then we should be still greater losers. Should we not, Mr. Driver ? Though between you and me, and speaking confidentially, that would be the quickest way to stop the nuisance ; but, then, who would expect us to give up our wine cellar, our luxuries, and those thousand little pleasantries that we enjoy out of the lives of these wretches, Somebody must work, of course ; we do not care who, eo long as we do not aud yet enjoy the profits, eh, Mr. Driver ! CHAPTER XXI. As soon a3 the policeman and the rest had left the house, Aunt Eliza returned to her own room, and hastily finishing her morning meal, prepared to carry her work home. For some time the arrest of the young tailorees had deprived Aunt Eliza of all thought regarding her own affaire ; but now the great object which had induced her to _\u2022 much exertion on the previous night, occupied her whole attention. Taking from her pocket a small bag, from which, after having carefully unrolled it, she drew out a number of pawnbroker's duplicates. These she carefully perused one after another. As she gazed at some of them, her tears rose afresh to her eyes, for many of those duplicates were the memoranda of lost relics, relics that had been given to her by her nusband, and which, one by one, had been pawned to supply the means of living ; and which, from the want of money, had rua beyond the twelvemonth aud so were lost to her for ever. At length she found the one which she most wanted, and hastily replacing the rest in the bag, she rolled it up again, and once more returnedMt to her pocket. She then carried her boy to her landlady, for her to take care of him whilst she was out, and though her heart was sad she smiled and kissed him with a mother's warmth, and promised if he would be a good boy and not cry, to bring him home something pretty and warm to wear. Having handed her dear pet over to the landlady, who took him with a very ill grace, she gave him another kiss, renewed."], [148, "126 aunt eliza's garret. her promise, and then hurried out with the work that was to be the means of redeeming some of little Joey's wearing apparel. When she arrived at the warehouse she had to wait her turn. She had uever before felt so anxious for it lo come as she did now : In sole thought was, how pleased her boy would be when she took hi. dress home. Several of the work people had arrived before her, which made the time for her to wait considerable ; it seemed to her as if her tarn would never come, so anxious was she to get home again and listen to her boy's prattle \u2014 for he was just beginning to speak \u2014 in his delight at receiving, as she wished him to believe, his new clothes. How nice, and how like old times, he would look. \" Come what will,\" she mentally said, \"I will never pawn any of his things again, every thing else shall go rather than his.\" At length her turn came, and with a light heart she entered the little room where the work was inspected and the hands paid. \" This work's done very well,\" exclaimed her employer. \" But havt you done all these yourself?\" \"Yes, sir, every stitch,\" returned Aunt Eliza. \" Humph ! Have you worked long hours ?\" \" Yes, sir, very long.\" \" Hah !\" \" I have only had two hours rest out of the twenty-four.\" \" Wanted money, eh ?\" demanded the contractor, for such he was. \" Very bad indeed, sir, I always do ; but I have worked hard lately because I had a particular motive.\" \"I'm very sorry to hear it,\" returned the contractor, \" Why, sir ?\" demanded Aunt Eliza ?\" \" Because I'm fearful you've been working to little purpose,\" was the reply. \"Indeed ! I trust not. I should be very much disappointed.' \" Well, I hope I'm mistaken ; but if you depend upon these dresses \u2014 .' 44 That is what I do depend on,\" exclaimed Aunt Eliza, interrupting him, \" and nothing else.\" \" Hah ! I'm very sorry to hear it,\" returned the contractor. \" Why, sir ?\" \"Because I'm compelled to reduce the price of these dresses just one-third,\" was the reply . \" Oh, sir, you don't mean that !\" \" But indeed I do.\" \" Why, sir, it will be impossible to get anything at all at that price. No one would do them,\" was Aunt Eliza's reply. \" You are mistaken. There's Smith, round in Wood Street, ha*"], [149, "aunt eliza's garret. 127 undertaken to do them at a less price than I have -, so if I don't reduce mine he'll have all the trade. We must all live, you know, somehow, Mrs. Pratt. I'm very sorry, but I cannot afford to pay more.\" \"My God! what shall I do?\" she exclaimed in bitter disappoint ment ; \" and I have worked so hard.\" \"I dare say.\" continued the contractor, \"we are all doomed to dis appointments. There's the money ; it's the most I can give, I assure you. You can have as much work as you like to do, and I'll try and make it up with something lighter.\" She took the money and some more work without scarcely knowing what she was doing, and walked out of the warehouse completely stupified. When she was in the street she gave vent to her tears which, with difficulty, she had kept from flowing while she was in the warehouse. She had not enough by two shillings to enable her to fulfil her promise to her child. Just at that moment the daughter of the man for whom she worked, dressed in the latest fashion, with her maid, passed her. \" If he cannot afford to pay more, it seems he can afford to dress his children well, aud that too out of other people's hard labour, whilst my poor boy must still remain half clad and ragged, because to mend bis things would cost a meal.\" \" Here they are a penny each !\" exclaimed a costermonger, who had, contrary to the orders of the police, m3de a pitch at the corner of the street. He w as selling cheap toys, and which he had arranged in the most showy manner on his barrow. They drew the attention of AUnt Eliza, who immediately bought a drum-rattle, a horse, and a whistle, muttering to herself as she put the money in the costermonger's hands, \" bless his little heart, he shall not be totally disappointed ;\" aud again the tears began afresh to run down her cheeks. When she reached home, the child began to show that delight at the return of its parent as most children do, and when the mother put in his lap the toys she had bought, his delight knew no bounds. They were the first toys he had ever had, aud, young as he was, he seemed to have a knowledge of the fact that his mother had bought them, because she had determined to bring him something home, and had been disap pointed in what she had placed her heart upon. The boy's delight tended somewhat to ease the mother's aching heart, and after almost smothering her child with kisses, she sat herself down to go on with her work. She had not long been engaged in this manner when her landlady, whom she had left down stairs not a quarter of an hour before, came into her room. \" Well, Mrs. Pratt,\" exclaimed that individual, taking a seat,"], [150, "V 128 aunt Eliza's garret. \" you've been into the ware-us, and I see you've got some money, or you couldn't a bought your child them playthings. I s'pose, then, you've got a little rent for me.\" \"Indeed, I'm very sorry,\" returned Aunt Eliza, \"but I've been disappointed in the warehouse, and have not received so much as I expected. On Saturday, perhaps, I may \u2014 .\" '\u2022 Oh.yes, that's all very well, Mrs. Pratt,\" continued the landlady, \" but you see the rent is gettin' on, and I'm on'y a poor, lone woman, depending entirely on what I makes by my rooms. And then that gal as was taken up for pawning Muster Driver's goods, yer see, don't, add to the respectability of my house ; it comes very hard upon me. But Susan Green certainly pays her rent reg'larly, and what she or her companion does with the work is no account of mine.\" \" I'm very sorry \u2014 .\" \" No doubt,\" continued the landlady, interrupting Aunt Eliza \" No doubt ; but then yer bein' sorry won't pay my rent, will it ?\" \" No,\" returned Mrs. Pratt, \" but if I can work through the week, I may be able to let you have some ou Snturday evening. We always paid regularly until I became HI.\" \"Yes, all that's very true; but that don't say you're not to pay now. You've got some money.\" \"I know I have, but I must live,\" returned Aunt Eliza. \"So must I.\" \" I have not enough to carry me on to Saturday as it is.\" \" You had enough to buy your young'un some playthings, though.\" \" True, for which I'm the sufferer. You surely would not deprive the child of the few things I have bought him ?\" exclaimed Aunt Eliza, rather warmly. \"Oh.no! I wouldn't deprive him of them. Oh.no! But then, yer see, the money that got him them playthings was not yourn nor his'n, but mine ; part o' my rent, and would have bought me a four pound loaf.\" \" Oh, this is cruel !\" exclaimed Aunt Eliza, burying her face in her hands. \" I don't know about being cruel, Mrs. Pratt. I ain't at any rate a ruff.\" \" What do you mean ?\" demanded Mrs. Pratt \" Mean ! Oh, how innocent, ain't us ? Mean ! why, that I'm not a rogue, or a thief.'' \" Do you mean to infer that I am one ?\" said Aunt Eliza, her pas sion rising. \" 'Taint quite the thing, is it, to have money in one's pocket, and"], [151, "AUNT ELIZA'S GARBET 129 not pay yer debts, eh? Or yet to go and buy such rubbish as this here, eh?\" As she asked these questions, with a sneer she gave the' horse \u2014 the head of which the child was busily engaged iu sucking \u2014 a spiteful kick, and sent it iu splinters to the other side of the room. \" I've a right to do as I like,\" exclaimed Aunt Eliza, taking the child, who began to scream, up into her lap. \" So have I,\" returned the landlady. \" Are you going to pay my rent now '!\" \" No, I cannot.\" \"Very well, then,\" exclaimed the landlady, her face becoming a deep crimson with her passion. Then goiug to the door and leaning over the balustrades, she called'out, \" Muster Barnes, step this way, if you please.\" In another minute the gentleman who answered to that name entered the room. \" Here, Muster Barnes, this here woman won't pay me my rent, _o you must do your best,\" coutinued the landlady, putting a strong emphasis upon the word woman. \"Jest so, ma'am,\" returned Mr. Barnes, who was a short, thin man, standing about four-feet eleven \u2014 certainly not five feet \u2014 and who was perfumed with a scent concocted of the ingredients used in French polishing; \" It's a painful dooty is a broker's dooty, ma'am,\" he con tinued, addressing Mrs. Pratt; \"yer see he's always called in to nettle leetle differences of rent. I'ts a wery painful dooty, though I says it, to take people's goods, and more especially a lady's goods. It'_ wery painful, but 1 always endeavours to do my dooty in the most purlite manner 'magiuable, and tho' I says it, ma'am, I always dislike* these here jobs: but if the wust comes to the wust, why, in coorse, i eawn't help it, aud I does my dooty accordingly.\" \"I leave it all to you mind,\" exclaimed the landlady a3 she left the room. \"All right, ma'am. I dessay this here lady and me will come to \u00bbome terms or other.\" He then commenced an inspection of the room and its occupam . After having spent some time in looking about him, with his hands thrust into his pockets, he sat himself down ou the bed as comfortably and familiarly as if he were the lord and master of the place. Some tittle time had elapsed, during which he amused himself with gazing vulgarly at Aunt Eliza, who sat pressing her child to her breast and crying bitterly. At length Mr. Barnes exclaimed : \u2014 \u25a0 \" Now, then, ma'am, eawn't you manage this here leetle aiTair ?\" \" Indeed I cannot,\" returned Aunt Eliza, between her sobs. \" If I could you may be sure I should only be too happy to do so.\""], [152, "130 aunt eliza's garret. \"I'm wery sorry to hear it. It's a pity to see Buch a am'able looking woman like you suffring so much for the want of a little of the ready. Arn't you got no friend who would lend you the money ?\" No.' \" Dear, dear,\" continued Barnes, groping about in his pockets, \" it's a wery great pity. You're a very nice-looking woman, too. I'm sorry to see ye in snch a fix, that I am. And so you don't see a way to get out of it, don't ye ?\" \"No.\" \" Well, I think I can.\" \" Indeed !\" exclaimed Aunt Eliza. 41 Yer see, it ain't much yer owe ; that is, it may be much to you, but it ain't much to one the likes of me. I've been rayther lucky myself, though I says it, but that's in consequence of doing business purlitely. So yer see, ma'rm, I don't want for a couter (sovereign) or two, I don't. Ah, there's nothing like a civil tongue in one's head, and I've been remarkable civil ; yes I have, ma'rm, though I says it as shouldn't.\" \" Pray what has all this to do with me ?\" demanded Aunt Eliza. \" Jest this here, ma'rm. You says you havn't a friend. Now I'm a wery sensitive person, 1 am, though I says it ; I'm wery sensitive, and I don't mind becoming your friend, on certain conditions.\" '\u2022 In what way do you purpose to become my friend?\" demanded Mrs. Pratt, in surprise. \" Jest in this manner. You want the money to pay the rent, don't you ?\" \" Certainly.\" \" Well, then, you shall have the money. I'll give it you, upon certain conditions.\" \" And what are those conditions?\" asked Aunt Eliza, eagerly. \" Why, that you act as my housekeeper.\" \" Act as your housekeeper !\" reiterated Aunt Eliza, \" I don't un derstand you.\" \" Well, then, I'll make myself plain. In fact, you're rather a pretty woman \u2014 I've a fancy for pretty women \u2014 and I can afford to treat that fancy if I likes, and so I'll pay your rent and keep it paid for you, and you shall have what you want from my butcher and my baker, if you likes, as the fashionables has it, to come under my pertection.\" The indignation that Aunt Eliza felt prevented her from speaking : she knew not in what way to give expression to her feelings. Mr. Barnes, finding that she made no answer, continued : \u2014 \" Well, they do say that silence gives consent, so I s'pose I may reckon upon the thing as being settled.\""], [153, "aunt eliza's garret. 131 \" You may reckon upon nothing os the kind !\" exclaimed Aunt Eliza, passionately. \"If you have come for rent I cannot pay you ; if you must have it, there's only the legal way open to you. I want neither money nor friendship such as your's.\" \" But your child may starve,\" returned Mr. Barnes. \" Not while I have hands to work.\" \" Pooh, nonsense ! you people can't live by your needle alone Don't be a fool now, accept my proposition ; I'll give you an hour to think about it.\" So saying he left the room. At the expiration of the hour he returned. \" Well, now, what do you say to my proposition ?\" \" What I said at first. That however poor and unfortunate I may be, I am at least too proud to sink so low as you would have me.\" \" It's wery hard to starve.\" \" I can go to the parish.\" \"You'll get kind treatment there, I fancy.\" \" Better to do that than become a thing you would have me.\" \u2022 Wery well, then, I must take your things.\" \"You won't take all, surely? You admit that the debt is not large. \"Well, what of that? S'pose I say the things, according to my opinion, is not worth more than the rent; you can't get over that. But, there, I won't be too hard upon you ; I want to be yer friend, so I'll only take yer bedstead. It'll about pay ; but you had better com* to my terms. \" Silence ! If you must take the bedstead, take it, and go.\" \"Oh, wery well ; but you'll come to me yet. If you want a pound you can have it, if you like to come to my terms. Besides, think of your child, ble33 his little heart, how pretty he would look in some nice things. Come, you may as well agree to what I say.\" And as he finished speaking, he threw his arms round Aunt Eliza's waist and hastily snatched a kiss. She immediately seized a small iron saucepan that was standing upon the hob and struck Barnes a good smart blow upon his head, which made him reel to the other side of tbe room. when he exclaimed : \u2014 . .. .l.u _e eAcjaimevi .\u2014 , \"Curse it, that's a stunner ! Here, Dick, come up here ; I blest if ever I met such a rumun' in all my life.\" The blow had its desired effect upon the heartless broker, who did not again reiterate his affectionate terms, but directed his man to tak* down the bedstead, and after having carried it down stairs, he gave Aunt Eliza the usual papers and left, muttering to himself\u2014 \" Curs* her proud heart, if I've luck, I'll be down upon her yet.\""], [154, "132 aunt Eliza's garret. When Aunt Eliza found herself once more alone, she buried hoi face in her hands, and after exclaiming\u2014\" My God ! what next !* nhe gare freevent to her tears. CHAPTER XXII. It was late at night when Amelia returned from work, and her surprise was great indeed when she discovered that the bedstead had been removed, but when she learned the cause of its being away and the impudent proposals the broker had made her aunt, her indignation was beyond description. Her aunt, during the relation of the day'* occurrences, beginning with the arrest of the young tailoress, cried bitterly. Amelia, after she had beard all her aunt had to say, sat for some time speechless. Presently she said : \u2014 \" Well, aunt, it is of no use crying in this manner ; the only thing we can do now is, to make the bed up in the best way we can on the floor, and then I'll see if I can help you with these dresses. I can't do much, but still it will be better than nothing.\" In a few minutes the bed was made in the warmest corner of the room, and little Joey put therein. Amelia then partook of a scanty supper, after which, instead of going to bed as she had hitherto done, she took up one of the dres.ses and worked upon it for a couple of hours. in the morning she rose a little earlier than she had previously been in the habit of doing, and, in the cold, worked for another hour upon the dress which she had began the night before. In this manner she continued, day after day, to assist her aunt, who, upon seeing how Amelia exerted herself, began with renewed energies to fight against the host of troubles that were arrayed against them. But, alas ! her l_-ame was diseased, and she began gradually to waste away. Week after week passed, and with it went some fresh article, which was sold to enable them to pay their rent aud to supply the actual necessaries of life. At length, they had nothing left but the mattrass on which to lie, and a blanket to cover them. Amelia worked hard, but the harder she worked, the faster they seemed to sink in their poverty. Aunt Eliza, at length, became too ill to work, and was compelled to remain all day upon the mattrass. The child never left her, and when Amelia was out at work, Susan Green endeavoured to supply her place"], [155, "AUNT ELIZAS GARRET 133 in attendance upon Mrs. Pratt. How long she might have remained in this position it is impossible to say, had not Susan, unknown dther to Mrs. Pratt or Amelia, succeeded in getting the parish surgeon to visit. When he b_,d attentively examined Mrs. Pratt for some time, he gravely shook his head and said privately to Susan Green : \u2014 \" I am afraid I can't do much for her while she remains here. She wants pare air, good food, and plenty of it ; medicine will not cure her thnugh it may strengthen her for a time. Send up to my place to morrow and I'll give you a mixture for her, but you must try and get her into the air. If obliged to work all the week, get her into the park on a Sunday ; keep her out all day if you can, that's the only way to act with any hope of a cure.\" For some little time the medicine appeared to strengthen her ; and with difficulty she on the Sunday, early in the morning, was enabled to crawl down as far as London Bridge, and breathe what little of the pure air she could that came off the river. She was still too weak to go so far as the parks. When she returned home some little cheap delicacy had been prepared for her, the joint production of Susan Green and Miss Johnson, which she devoured with eagerness. She then laid herself down upon the mattress aud slept soundly for some hours. On the Mond.iy morning she sat on the mattress and endea voured to do a little work. Mr. Godfrey, who had heard of their distress, carried the matter into the counting-house, and succeeded in starting a subscription amongst the clerks with whom George had been a favorite, and who was held in great admiration by them for his having shewed such a courageous spirit in the attack he had made upon Sublimus Quizby. They col lected a sovereign amongst them, to which amount Sublimus had contributed a threepenny piece. Mr. Godfrey met Amelia on the following morning as she was going to work, and, aster having stopped her and inquired about her aunt and herself, with some confusion slipped into her hands an envelope, saying, as he did so :\u2014 \" Oh, here's a little note that I have been asked to give you. I can' stop longer; so good morning, and I hope things will change. They must, in fact. You have had as much trouble as one can possibly have ; things must therefore take a turn and go up again. It's a long lane that has no turning, you know. Good by.\" They then parted. Amelia could scarcely restrain her curiosity until she arrived at Mrs. Jennings's. Immediately she had entered, and before she had taken her bonnet off, she opened the envelope. To her surprise it contained a couple of sovereigns, one of which was the gift. 9"], [156, "134 AUNT ELIZA'S OAERET. of Godfrey though Amelia was not aware of tbe fact. Ou the piece' ot\" paper in which the money had been wrapped, were traced the words. following i \u2014 \"Miss Pratt will greatly oblige the genilemen employed in the firn* of Messrs. Thompson, Hickory and Thompson, by aceepting theendosed. as a small tribute of the respect they emertain for her brother.\" This unlooked-for kindness affected her raore than all her troubles, and for once tears rose in her eyes. They were, however, but few ; and summoning all her energies, she determined to persevere more earnestly than ever. At noon, instead ef eating her scanty meal im the workroom, she hastened home, first purchasing, some food which she knew her aunt most wauted. When she reached borne she found Mr. Rune, in -hor roomy talking very loudly to her aunt. \"What's the meaning of this?\" demanded AmeH_e. \" The rtnts in arrear agin, and I'in endeavouring to eeme- to terms,\" auswered B-iraes, \"\u25a0There is no oeeasioritcrgivc yourself so muefc. t toubl e,\" returned Amelia. \" Five weeks are duo, are there not ?.\"\" \" Jest so.\" 44 There'* the money,\" .ontinuedAmdiay \" counting it out, and aS the same time showing the remaining sovereign, is. the midst of the silver.\" \"Ah, I seeyoo be a _*nsibley\u00abong ooman and no- mistake.

There's only another conclusion that i can come to, and as I said afore 1 say agin, joasre got a friend. Well, I like you foi keeping. your own affeirs- to- yeurselt- _iood morning. And p'r'aps, ma'am, you'll take a leaf oot of tfcis ywmg 'oonmn's book, it'll save you a deal t.f bother ; so* once more-, good morning.\" \" In the name of heaven _\" exclaimed Aunt Eliza- as soon ___- Barnea had left the room, \" how did yott get that money V Amdia in answer gave her aunt, Godfrey's note. \"Thank God!\" she ejaculated as soon as she had perused it. \"It will save us a little longer and something may turn up before it is all spent,\""], [157, "aunt eliza's garret. 135 The words had scarcely issued from her lips, when in bounced Ih landlady, without so much as stopping to knock at the door. \" 'Pon my word, Mrs. Pratt,\" she exclaimed \" sine goings on here, ain't it? Very fine indeed, I think.\" 41 What do you mean ?\" asked Amelia, who invariably, when at home, was speaker in affairs of business. \" Tm disgusted, Mrs. Pratt, at your goings on. I'm surprised at what Tm told.\" \" You have received your rent. Have you not ?\" asked Amelia. \" Yes, I have.\" \" Then as you have no right here, perhaps you will leave the room,\" returned Amelia. \" No right here, hussy!\" screamed the landlady, \"and who has a better right I should like to know ? \" Not you ! and another thing, I won't have you here any longer.\" \"Very well,\" returned Amelia, quietly, without showing any fear of the woman who was mad with passion ; tbe cause of which was, that she had been paid and that none of the remaining goods of Aunt Eliza had been taken by the broker. \" I won't have you in my house !\" screamed the landlady. \" We can go somewhere else, I dare say,\" returned Amelia. \"I dare say, but not in a respectable house. There's plenty of bad houses in the next street, they'd take you in there. It's only in such places that gals like you ought to live.\" \" Indeed !\" said Amelia. \" What am I to learn from this ?\" \" Oh, how innocent we are, wery, ain't we ? How came you with gold, I should like to know ? Not honestly.\" \" I am not bound to confess to you how I obtained it,\" said Amelia, calmly, and seeing that her aunt was going to explain, seized the letter, and then continued, \u2014 \" Nonsense, aunt, we have not sunk to that. Where's your spirit, aunt ? Are we to be forced to make this woman a confidant and remain entirely under her thumb?\" 41 Oh, no, certainly not,\" continued Mrs. Jackson, \" I don't want to be your confidant, or to have a parcel of bad women under my roof. I have allays kept myself respectable, though I am a lone widow and had no end of troubles ; so you had better find yourselves some other room by this time next week.\" \" We can do that,\" returned Amelia. \" And mind, don't send here for a reference, for if you do, I shall just let em know what I think of you.\" \" You can do as you please,\" returned Amelia,"], [158, "136 aunt eliza's garret. 41 1 shall, much to your sorror, I can tell you.\" So saying she bounced out in the same manner that she had entered. \" Oh, my God, aunt, this is worst of all. Poverty I can bear; but to be thought bad because a friend helps us, is too much.\" For some time she sat upon a chair quite absorbed in her grief. At length she recovered from the shock to which her feelings had been subjected, and turning to her aunt, she continued \u2014 \"I'll go and look for a room somewhere \u2014 anywhere would be preferable than being here, where that old woman's tongue can continually break in ui>on our quiet. I will not, if it can be helped, pass another week in the house.\" Then quietly kissing her aunt and Joey, both of whom were crying, she left the room. CHAPTER XXIII. The little time that Amelia could spare she spent in searching for another room ; but she found the one great obstacle to her success to be the want of a \" reference.\" In many places, when she said where she was then living, she was told, at once, that they could not think of letting her come and lodge there. Her landlady, it appeared, had become too notorious in the neighbourhood ; and, strange as it may appear to many of our readers, though Amelia and her aunt had lived so long in the house, they bad not learned the character of their land lady so well as many of the neighbours. She was one of that class of women who trade upon the virtue of their female lodgers ; or rather, upon their want of it. Her system was, to let lodgings to respectable young, single women, or widows, who had become reduced ; then, under a canting profession of honesty, respectability, religion, and friendship, to worm herself into the secrets of her lodgers. As they became poorer, she advanced them small loans; and, being a shrewd jude-f of cha racter and disposition, she watched her opportunity se her mode of action judiciously. If her intended victim fell lUtoher hands, it was well and good ; but if otherwise, she proceeded to ex tremities, and deprived them, by the assistance of Bam<..., of their furniture and whatever wearing apparel that the unfortunate might possess, except that which was actually on her baek. Thus reduced, with starvation staring them in the face, she generally found that"], [159, "AUNT ELIKA's GARRET. 137 virtue yielded to the first temptation which she artfully threw in the way. Thus, while boasting of being religious, she kept up an unin terrupted correspondence with those who best suited her wicked pur poses ; and while the lodger was sinkiug she was calculating the best way to put the unfortunate being easily in the power of those who paid her. This was the reason of her anger when Amelia paid the rent; and feeling convinced that Amelia had Income the victim of some one else, her passion overruled her judgment, and prompted her to throw out the dark insinuation ; her words, in fact, being the expression of her own bad wishes. Amelia tried to get another room but without success ; the day on which her tenancy expired had arrived and no other room had been obtained. It is true money can do almost anvthing ; but although Amelia possessed a little of that article \u2014 the remainder of the two pounds \u2014 still that was not sufficient to enable her to pay rent in advance. Besides, her dress was against her ; she was so thinly clad, that that fact alone spoke too plainly of her poverty. If she had had money, the impression it would have made would have been against her. She would have been looked upon as dishonest, directly. Money, in the hands of a poorly clad person, creates a doubt in the suspicious brain of the would-be respectable cockney ; while the man or woman well dressed, or even dressed showily, seems to carry an air of re spectability aud honesty, and though he may not have a farthing in his pocket, he is more likely to be trusted and to obtain that which he seeks, than one whose intentions are honest, but whose clothes speak of long service. Early in the morning Mrs. Jackson asked to speak to Amelia. This time, however, she condescended to knock at the door before she entered. When she had been desired to \" come iu,\" she quietly walked about a yard into the room, aud there stood until asked to take a seat, Aunt Eliza at the same time pushing a stool towards her. \" Well, ladies,\" she said, as she seated herself upon it, \" I hopes we are better friends again, and that we ain't a going to part jist yet.\" 41 Indeed !\" exclaimed Amelia and her aunt together. \" Have you got a room yet ?\" asked Mrs. Jackson, without appearing to notice their surprise. \" Why T demanded Amelia, hastily. 41 Because if you hadn't, you know,\" returned the landlady, trying to appear very amiable, \" I was going to offer you the room ag\"in.\" \" I wonder you can wish us to stay,\" returned Amelia, \" after having expressed the very bad opinion you have of us.\" \" I'm very sorry, miss, for what I said, that I am ; but I was in a"], [160, "138 AUI.T ELIZA'S GARRET. very great passion at the time. It was all through Muster Barnes telling me what he did ; and then I had jist been told ag'in of that affair of the young ooman taken from the next room by the policeman. It gits my house a bad name ; and Muster Barnes, miss, has talked & great deal about it, and I can assure you more people than one has told me on it. That's what made me flare up as I did the other day, but Miss Johnson has told me all about it, and all I can say is, I'm sorry for what I said ; and if you like to stay, I'm willing for you so to do.\" 41 1 am much obliged to you, and I dare Bay aunt is,\" returned Amelia, \" and if she likes to accept your offer I can but let the people know.\" \" Fudge !\" muttered the landlady to herself, \" the proud young minx ! She ain't got what she wanted, but her pride won't let her say so. I'll have her down a peg or two yet.\" \" I'm sure, Amelia, you know best,\" said her aunt ; \" you know we are not sure of the room.\" \" Gammou !\" still muttered the landlady, <* how they thinks to trick me ! It gives me the sick ; but it strikes me I'll trick them.\" \" But you know, aunt, we are not sure of always paying our rent to the day ; and that must be a source of annoyance and expense to Mrs. Jackson ; I'm sure she cannot like to have such bad paying tenants.\" As Amelia gave utterance to these words a sarcastic smile played upon her lips, which severely tried her landlady's temper. \"Well, you see, miss,\" rdurned the landlady, \" I only do what I'm forced to do, and what every other lanlady would do. I'm sure it grieves me to see you in sich trouble ; and if my lanlord did not put upon me so hard, I'm sure I should be the last to put upon anybody d_-.\" 44 1 think we had better stay,\" said Aunt Eliza, \" at least for another week or so, and if we can't agree, we can but leave then.\" \" Yery well, aunt,\" returned Amelia, \"let it be so then.\" \" You're very good !\" ejaculated the landlady ; \" I'm much obleeged to you ; we'll then consider the thing as settled, and so say nothing more about it.\" Just at that moment Joey, who had been sa__t asleep during tbe fore going dialogue, woke up and began to cry. Mrs Jackson darted towards the bed, and taking tbe child in her arms, began to kiss his cheek with as much apparent warmth as if he were her own child. \" Bless its dear little heart '.\" she exclaimed, \" did he wake up, and didn't he have half enough sleep ? Does he want to go to his mother *. So he shall then, bless him '.\""], [161, "atint eliza's garret. 139 Amelia felt disgusted with the conduct of the woman, though she eould not tell why ; and to prevent her feelings from being seen, ____\u25a0 busied herself in preparing 3o\u0153e food for the boy. \" Let me see,\" continued the landlady, \" what I've got in ray poefcfi for tbe little dear ; I think I can find seniething for the blessed pet. Yes, to be sure ! Oh, my patieoee, there !\" As she finished speaking she placed in the child's hand a cake, which he began te est imme diately, whilst Mrs. Jackson commenced singing ta tbe etild in a peculiarly affected manaer \u2014 for she had an idea that she was * good singer, and thai no one could Bing like she could \u2014 a song which con sisted of nething more than a pieee of very in_porta._fc information put into verse, which ndther Pope, Byrsn, or Hood could imitate. It wat as follows ; \u2014 44 Billy Button lost his nose, Want of money made him sad. Without feel we can't hare toes. Crazy folk are always mad.' The which she continued to repeat until she was interrupted by Amelia flaying : \u2014 \" I suppose, aunt, we had better pay this week's rent while we <.__\u00a7, we shall at any rate be safe ser another week from Mrs. JackfloaT* friend, the, broker.\" \" Fm sure, Amelia,\" returned her aunt, \" you know best. Tan at way* ready to pay when I've got the means.\" 41 I'm much obleeged to you,\" said the landlady, addressing Mrs. Pratt \" I don't like te .trouble you, and if it ain't quite conreuient we can let it stand another week.\" \" Oh, no \" exclaimed Amelia, \" we may have your frissd, Barnes, tgain. You had better take your money while you can.\" \" Well, if if s quite eonvenient I shall be very glad to take tt, for I'm but a poor, lone woman, depending entirely upon what I makes by my rooms.\" The rent was put into her hands, and soon afterwards she left the room, muttering to herself as went down stairs : \u2014 \" Never mind, my proud hussey, I'll make you s-iffer for your sneer* yet, or I'm mistaken.\""], [162, "aunt Eliza's uarbet. CHAPTER XXIV. Directly Mrs. Jackson had left the room, Amelia, with a lighter heart, returned to her work ; her aunt at the same time proceeded with the embroidery she had in hand, feeling, for the moment, as if a heavy weight had been removed from her breast. Her spirits; in consequence, became more buoyant ; she quickened the movement of her lingers,- inr the hope that by a little extra energy she would be enabled' to keep> the broker at bay. For some little time longer they continued to struggle against adversity, paying their rent weekly, although fre quently they had to debar themselves from food to> do so. Bat the fcar of the broker prevented them asking their landlady to wait over the week. They felt convinced that if one week passed unpaid they would never be able to- pay two together ; and they had had too much experience of their landlady's treatment, when they were in arrear. to desire to be in such a position again. The shortness of food and continual hard labour, soon destroyed the good effects\" of the surgeon's treatment of Aunt Eliza, who again found herself re-fatecd to such a state that it was impossible for her to work. The suppert of herself and Joey once more depended upon the labours of Amelias, Tbe rent day came and there was no money to meet the landlady's demand. Contrary to expectation, Amelia found Mrs. Jackson willing to oblige her, by letting the matter stand over for a short time, and who even went so far as to offer to lend her two or three shillings. Amelia was certainly at a loss to account for such an apparent change in Mrs. Jackson's conduct ; but then, as she said, \" no Christian eould drive a poor gal so hard when things went so cross.\" It soon became obvious to every one that Aunt Eliza would never again be fit to work. Never very strong, her severe trials, hard work, and want of sufficient food, had rendered her prematurely old. She had drawn too freely upon her capital \u2014 strength, that no effects re mained ; and now a bankrupt, it was in vain endeavouring to start afresh in life's struggle ; she lacked its dearest coin, health ; and every effort but made her beggary more conspicuous. Now came Amelia's severest trials. Her aunt was ill beyond rriief \u2014 save indeed by death. Who can judge of the bitter feelings that Amelia daily and hourly experienced ? Is it possible that anything could be more poignant than the fact of knowing that her aunt must die ? That nothing could save her ; that on herself were her aunt and"], [163, "AUNT ELIZA'S GARRET. 141 Joey dependent ; by her scanty earnings was her aunt to be supported in that state which may be said to be neither existing in this world or departing from it. Then the uncertainty of how long she would remain in that state, the vain hope, still lingering, that she might recover. The anxious question of what would become of her and Joey was ever uppermost in her thoughts, although to one possessed of coolness it must have been evident that the sooner death relieved her of her aunt the better it would be for herself. But Amelia loved her aunt as she would have loved a mother ; in fact, her aunt was the only mother Amelia had ever known. Again and again did she give utterance to the prayer, perchance sinfully, that her aunt might live. even if she lingered in the state that she was then in. Day after day Amelia toiled with a saddened heart and aohing brow, smiling never. With each succeeding day her aunt grew more peevish and discontented. If Amelia lingered longer than was her usual practice; \u2014 and sometimes it was unavoidable \u2014 when she reached home she was met by unkind words and sour reproach. Every time she entered the room she expected to find the broker there, or to find her aunt lying upon the floor, the bed having been taken away to help pay tbe rent that was now fearfully in arrear. But when she found everything as she had left it, she thanked heaven that her landlady had still some kind feeling in her breast ; and in return for such gene rosity, Amelia, as she sat watching by the bedside of her aunt previous to her retiring to rest, embroidered a piece of silk that had been given her by Mrs. Jennings, an especial favour, and after making it up into a bonnet, presented it to her landlady, as a tokau of her gratitude. Alas ! poor girl, you little thought that the words of kindness and the apparent leniency were but a. part of her deep scheme against yourself. She had read you, Amelia, as a book, until she knew you better than you knew yourself. Each act or word was duly weighed ere it was done or uttered. It had its purpose. Some stronghold to undermine, some prejudice to disperse, or some virtuous sentiment to> kill. Truly, woman's greatest enemy is woman ! When Amelia presented Mrs. Jackson with the bonnet, the produce of her midnight toil, a smile lit up the countenance of the latter; for she was fond of dress to a degree. There was something, too,, about Amelia, so meek and humble, so timid and graceful, that Mrs. Jackson could not prevent a dim vision of bank notes from floating before her eyes, the profits of her scheming ; and she smiled accordingly. The bonnet was but the first fruit \u2014 a mere nothing, but just enongh to show the richness of the soil. She would gather other and richer fruit yet. Something that would pay her for her leniency."], [164, "AUNT ELIZA'S GARRET. 142 Susan Green did all that was in her power to help Amelia, and when she bad work to do at home, she would attend as much as pos sible to the wants of Aunt Eliza, who otherwise would, in all proba bility, have laid upon the bed during Amelia's absence without being able to help herself or her child, towards whom, as she found herself growing weaker, her affection increased a hundred fold ; indeed, it was heart-breaking to see the mother, vainly struggling, either to relieve her child's wants or to amuse and nurse him ; and failing, for want of strength, to see the tears that flowed down her cheeks because she could not act towards him as she had hitherto done ; and then, in the petulancy of the moment, praying that she and her child might die at once, and be laid by the Bide of her husband. For weeks this state of things lasted, Aunt Eliza getting neither better nor worse. Amelia now and then, by excessive toil, succeeded in earning enongh to give her landlady a little money, though not one-tenth part of her demand, which was continually increasing. This, as Amdia thought, succeeded In keeping her landlady quiet. At length her aunt became quite childish ; at times even idiotic and dirty. At one time weeping over her miseries ; at another, declaiming in a puerile manner against those who were her friends ; accusing them of robbing her, of having killed her husband, and of ill-treating her child. She occasionally possessod the delusion that she was a lady in good circumstances. At such times she treated those around her as her servants ; Amelia she was constantly accusing of ingratitude. For hours, as Amelia worked by her side \u2014 for Mrs. Jennings as much as possible permitted her to take her work home \u2014 would her aunt preach to her about the dreadful sin of ingratitude, reminding her of the many kind acts she had done for her when she first lost her mother. \" What, I should like to know,\" she would say, \" would have become of you, Amelia, had it not been for me? And now I'm weak and can't get about, you ought to let me have more of your time than you do, I'm sure you might spare me more of it \u2014 it is little I get, God knows. I can't think what you want with so much finery (alluding to Amelia's work), for my part, but you know you always were a nasty, quiet, self-willed girl ; you know you sent your brother away ; he was a kind, good-natured, merry fellow, but you know you would always have your way and he didn't like it. All you think of is fancy work ; all you do is fancy work ; and rob me up hill and down dale to fina you the means, whilst my poor boy may go without ; bless his heart he is the only being that loves me, and because he does you keep him away from me. Why, I should like to know, may I not have my own child in my arms like any other mother, and kiss and fondle him ? Ah, well, when I'm dead I shall.\" Then"], [165, "AUNT ELIZA'S GARRET. 143 after a pause she would continue :\u2014 \" Dear me, Amelia, you look very tired, child ; put your work away ; why, bless you, you'll never get a sweetheart if you illuse those pretty eyes. I remember when I was your age, girl, I was always romping about in the fields, I was, indeed. It was Buch fun to go skipping about and nobody to keep you bound. I was always laughing then, and you should laugh too. It will be quite enough for you to look solid when you get as old as I am, and have the cares that I have \u2014 but there, get the dinner, I'm very hungry \u2014 there are no fields here, though \u2014 you said you would take me to the park, Amelia ; why don't you put that work away and go with me now ? But no, you're too selfish ; that's no pleasure to you, but fancy work is, and so I may suffer. Why don't you get the dinner ? I wonder how it looks. I wonder if it's anything like the green fields were, when I was at home. Amelia, do the birds sing there like they do in the country ? I say, Amelia, now do they ? Law, it must be very pretty to hear them ! Now do eo with me, just for once. Now do, after dinner. Why don't you get it? If you'll go, I'll do every thing you want me. But there, why should I beg of you ? Think what you owe me, and what I have done for you ! I'll die first, before I'll ask a favour of such a selfish girl as you ! Amelia, how often am I to speak? Why don't you get the dinner when I tell you ?\" Such was the frequent childish language of Aunt Eliza to Amelia, as the latter was engaged at her work. It was a severe trial to Amelia to meet such cruel and unjust upbraiding. Of course, the knowledge that her aunt was not fully conscious of the meaning of the words she uttered, destroyed in a great measure the sting which they were intended to inflict; but, notwithstanding, it was a severe trial to Amelia's patieuce to contend with the peevishness of her aunt, and to humour all her selfish whims. At length a change came ; tho little remaining strength disappeared, aud Aunt Eliza lay, upon the mattress, without even the power of moving a muscle, awaiting Death. Her consciousness was, however, for a short time restored. She was again painfully aware of all that was taking place around her. She knew that her sufferings would only end when Death laid his icy linger upon her. Hope, she had none ; and as she gazed upon her boy, Despair took full possession of her soul. The only prayer she uttered was, that the child might die. She had no thought of what might come after death. When spoken to upon the matter, the only reply that could be obtained from her was, \" that come what might, she couldn't suffer in the next world more than she had dono in this.\" Apparently, she had no fear Of death ; not that she wae? rendered fearless by the consolation that is afforded by a faith in Christ, or that she knew that that faith would save her from everlasting perdition;"], [166, "144 aunt eliza's garret. but her spirit had of late been so much depressed that now she had approached so near to Death she could not be got to understand that doctrine of salvation which she had neglected to study when in a state of comparative affluence. Her apparent ease \u2014 an ease almost amounting to carelessness \u2014 was, therefore, the effects of a want of perception, a want of a sufficient knowledge to understand the great change that was about to take place. She evidently cared nothing for herself. The maternal feelings were predominant, and she made Amelia promise that, if Joey should live after her aunt's death, she would act a mother's part towards him, as her aunt had acted the mother's part towards herself. \" You promised me, Amelia,\" she said, \"that you will work for him the same as you have done while I havft been with you, that if he should become ill, you will nurse him atteutively, and never let him want, for anything whatever it may cost you in the getting. Promise me, Amelia, on your knees promise me, and if you believe that there is a God ; that there are, as the minister says, rewards and punish ments, swear to do it, as you hope to escape the one and to meet the other.\" \"Oh! aunt, indeed I will !\" exclaimed Amelia. \"I promise you that there is not a thing, if I can do it, but what I will do it, if it is to keep him from want, I'll work my fingers to the very bone for him t* \" I worked for you, Amelia,\" returned her aunt. ,4I sheltered you, you tound a mother in me.\" 44 And he shall find one in me. I'll do my best, aunt, indeed I will,\" exclaimed Amelia. \" I hope so,\" returned her aunt, \" but I can scarcely have confidence even in you. There's no confidence to be placed in any one. Even God's unjust I\" \" Oh, aunt !\" exclaimed Amelia, with a shudder, '4 don't for gracious sake talk so.\" \" If he had been just,\" continued Aunt Eliza, wildly, \"-should you and I have been made to suffer as we have? What have you or I ever done to a single soul to deserve all this? At least, I never have, I know ; but have always, when I conld, helped others on their way. But who bas^helped us ?\" \" Mr. siodfrey helped us a little,\" mildly returned Amelia. \"Well, well,\" continued Aunt Eliza, after a pause, \" you have all before you. If you can think well of the world, do so. I only hope that my boy may never live to know its cruelty.\" \" It shall not be cruel to him if I can save him from its troubles, I promise you I'll do all that in me lies to make him happy.\" \" I am satisfied with your promise, Amelia, I suppose I must be,\""], [167, "MJ11 BED r_;'.''ij >"], [168, ""], [169, "aunt Eliza's garret. 145 replied Aunt Eliza; \"but notwithstanding all, I would to heaven that he were dead; 1 should then die more happy than I shall, leaving him behind to an uncertain fate.\" After giving utterance to this sentence, she sank into a quiet slumber In this state she remained for nearly three hours ; at length, she again opened her eyes, and in a voice scarcely audible, she called to Amelia, who hastened to her side, and kneeling down asked her what she wanted. \" Bring me Joey.\" Amelia did as her aunt desired. She held him in such a position that the mother might kiss her child. Her eyes, for the moment, brightened up as they gazed upon his face ; which, at the time was beaming with a smile. She kissed her child again and again ; and then from very \"weakness closed her eyes, murmuring:\u2014 \" God bless him ! Amelia\u2014 your promise. God bless him and take him soon away.\" As she finished speaking a change came over her countenance. Her spirit had wandered into the pitchy darkness of the unknown world. CHAPTER XXY. When we expect troubles they frequently disappoint us, and make their visits when we are least prepared to meet them. Such was the case with Amelia. For a long time past she had expected her aunt to die ; but when consciousness returned, hope again possessed Amelia's breast, and for a time pictured her aunt's recovery. It was then that Death struck his unerring blow. Amelia's troubles were now continually on the increase. During her aunt's illness the idea of how she should bury her, in the event of her death, had never for a moment entered her mind. Now, the fact was staring her in the face. Her aunt must be buried \u2014 how ? Amelia had not a penny when her aunt died. All that she possessed was, her own wearing apparel \u2014 thin and scanty\u2014 the half of a loaf and the few things which were mockingly styled furniture. Sarah Green and the landlady assisted in the \" laying out\" of the body on the floor of the apartment. It was duly washed with spirits,"], [170, "146 aunt bliza's garret. Sarah Green spending her last sixpence to obtain It. The landlady lent a sheet to place over the body, and after shaking up the mattress and remaking the bed, left Amelia and Joey by themselves, to sleep, if possible, almost side by side by the dead body. Amelia could uot lie down ; her mind was too much oppressed. She sat for some time with Joey lying across her knees, her eyes staring senselessly upon the corpse. Her mind, in fact, was completely overpowered. The more she endeavoured to think the less capable she felt of doing so; at length, completely exhausted by the combination of her troubles, she sank upon the mattress, not to sleep, but to pass the night in a dreamy state, which, when it ceases, leaves excruciating pains in the head that almost amount to madness, while every limb feels as if it had lost the power of action. Early in the morning the landlady entered the room with all the officiousness imaginable. Everything she did she boasted was for the purpose of saving Amelia's feelings ; but, in reality, it was for the purpose of getting a greater control over her future actions. ~ \"Well, my dear miss,\" exclaimed Mrs. Jackson, \"how d'ye intend burying yer aunt ?\" \" I don't know,\" returned Amelia, \"I have not the least idea. Don't talk to me now, my head is so bad.\" \" But you musn't put this here hoff, you know. You ought to send for the undertaker at once,\" retorted Mrs. Jackson, rather sharply. \" I can't do it now,\" replied Amelia. \" Well, if you're so ill as all that comes to, I'll do it for you, that Is, if you likes. I dou't often like to interfere with other people's business. I'm only a poor, lone woman to be sure, and can't do much anyways, and I have a hard fight on it myself to make matters go on at all near the mark, and no mistake about it.\" 41 You're very kind,\" exclaimed Amelia, pressing her aching brow with both her hands. \" What ought to be done ? I don't know and cannot think.\" \"You can't pay to bury her yerself, that's quite sure\u2014 ain't it?\" demanded the landlady. \" I have not a farthing,\" returned Amelia. \" Of course not. Then there's only one way for yer to do it,\" was the landlady's reply. Amelia did not understand her, and stared in a stupified manner, endeavouring to gather her meaning from her face. \"You don't know what I means, I see,\" continued the landlady; \"yon ain't up to this here sort of thing, I can tell. What I means is, she must be buried by the parish.\""], [171, "aunt eliza's garret. 147 \" By the parish !\" exclaimed Amelia, in surprise and indignation 41 1 can't see no other ways,\" returned the landlady. \" A pauper funeral !\" muttered Amelia. \"It's the only thing that's to be done.)' \" Sunk so low as that !\" continued Amelia. \" Oh, my head wil_ split.\" \"If you stay there, you will then be more lucky than a good many others I know,\" retorted the landlady with a sneer. \" What's the good of a fine burying I should like to know '.'\" Then after a pause, she continued, \" well, how is it to be ?\" \" How is what to be !\" exclaimed Amelia, who had become for the moment unconscious of everything around her. \" The burying,\" returned the landlady. \" Shall I tell the parish officers ?\" \" I have no money, and I \u2014 .' \" Must knuckle down to it with the best face you can,\" retorted the landlady, interrupting Amelia in her reply. \" It's all I can do,\" returned Amelia ; and again she pressed her feverish hands against her throbbing brow. \" Yet it is too horrible to think of.\" \" Then don't think on it,\" exclaimed the landlady. \" It's the best way, you may be sure. There 'ud be a precious little done, I reckon, in the world, if people was to allays think afore they did. Some things won't abear thinking on, and if they won't why it's best to leave off a doing it.\" \" You know best, I dare say,\" murmured Amelia, ,4and can best tell me what to do. Oh, I wish George was at home.\" \" Well, I fancy I havn't been all these ere year? in the world without learniug a suramut,\" replied the landlady, \" Do what you think best, and I shall always feel bound in gratitude to you,\" returned Amelia. \" I am so ill now I cannot act for myself. Oh, God ! only to think a parish funeral !\" \"Very well, miss; now you've made up your mind, 111 cut about it at once,\" exclaimed the landlady. \" it's a good job the boy sleeps so well ; you'd better try and do so too ; I won't be long afore I'm back again.\" As these words fell from the lips of Mrs. Jackson she passed out of the room and hastened on her en-and with a great deal of pleasure. Amelia had acknowledged to owe her a debt of gratitude. She would make something of it, and that, too, before many days bad passed over her head."], [172, "148 aunt eliza's garret. In the latter part of the day a couple os men entered the room with a shell, the munificent gift of the parish, and with carelessness almost amounting to brutality in appearance, bundled the body into it and forthwith proceeded to nail the body down. \"What are you doing?\" exclaimed Amelia. \" Fastening down to be sure, \" replied one. \"But why in such a hurry? You might leave it open as long as possible,\" suggested Amelia. \" Might I,\" returned the man. \" Fraps I might. We bury her to-morrow, and we are precious busy now and can't lose no time, no how.\" \" Bury her to-morrow !\" exclaimed Amelia.] \" Why she only died last night !\" \" Can't hdp it, thems our orders.\" Amelia said no more, but sat watching them as they fastened the lid down. They were just preparing to leave the room when the landlady again entered, bringing iu her hand a cup of hot tea, which she handed to Amelia, saying as she did so : \u2014 \" There make your mind easy, it is all settled. \" You have lost no time,\" returned Amelia. \" I'm told they will take her from me tomorrow.\" \" So soon as that,\" exclaimed the landlady in surprise. \" That's rather sharp ain't it, mister ?\" \" Them's our orders, and I s'pose the great 'uns must have their way.\" returned the man who acted as spokesman for himself and com panion. \" Well, well, never mind,\" continued the landlady turning to Amelia. \" It's what it must come to, sure enough. It can't make no difference whether it comes fust or last.\" \" No difference at all,\" muttered Amelia in that quiet way of hers. \" Poor people ought not to have the feelings of the rich \u2014 no affections. No, it can make no difference.\" \"There, don't think about it,\" continued the landlady, '.drink this tea while it's hot. It'll do yer good.\" \" Thank you,\" returned Amelia, as she took it mechanically from the landlady's hand. \"Well, good afternoon ma'rm,\" exclaimed the undertaker's men. \" We shall be here about jthree tomorrow. Whoever follows must take care and be ready in time. It won't do to keep the parson wait ing, especially if it is at all dampish.\""], [173, "aunt Eliza's garret. 149 The men then left the room. \" And this is a pauper-funeral !\" exclaimed Amelia. '\u2022 I wonder what comes next. It may as well be at first as at last.\" \" Your tea is getting cold,\" said the landlady, pointing to the cup. \" Dear me, so it is,\" returned Amelia ; \" you are very kind ; I had forgotten it.\" It was in vain Mrs. Jackson endeavoured to produce a different feeling in Amelia's breast. All her conversation and officiousness lo.-:. their effect upou her. She was too much engrossed with the thought of her aunt's death, and of , the intended pauper burial. This was a severe blow to Amelia ; and in her present weak and confused state of mind she had not strength enough to resist it properly, or to reasou herself into a fitting- submission. Mrs. Jackson saw that something must be done to give Amelia relief. She was a cunning nurse and had many a remedy of her own, which she believed to be better than all the medicine ever mixed by a doctor. She immediately commenced operations and succeeded at length iu getting Amelia into bed and in inducing her to swallow a small basinful of a gruel-like preparation. After having partaken of which she fell into a sound sleep, from which she did not awake until late on the following morning. As Mr. Jackson gazed upon Amelia's pale cheek a peculiar expression flitted across her face. For a moment there was a contention going on in the woman's breast; for a moment her better feelings were uppermost. \"Poor thing!\" she muttered, \"she's struggled hard ag'in her troubles, anyhow. So did my gal \u2014 so did my gal ! It was no good though. Once down, you're down for ever.'' At the appointed time the men came to take the body to the grave- yard ; a small patch of ground, hid behind a quantity of houses, into which had been huddled hundreds of dead bodies. So thick, indeed, were they lying about, that you might, in fact, be said to walk ou human flesh as you paced this small plot of parish property ; thi3 yard of dead men's bones aud putrifying flesh. As the graves yawned to receive their fresh victims they showed the late deposits on either side ; while, in many cases, the coffins were gaping open and sendin forth a poisonous stench. This was and is in London where there is so much noise made about burying the dead away from the living.* \u2022 \"When the above was written such was the fact, but since the laws to prevent burning in thickly-populated towns have come into operation, and since they have been so vigorously put in practice by the government. It iB not, perhaps, strictly just to let the above sentence pass without remarking that many of tbes. grounds are finally closed, and many others ordered to be finally closed at a future day named for that purpose. 10"], [174, "150 aunt eliza's garret. It was a wet, dull, day. Not that it rained, but that it was just snch a day as you will find no where else than in London. Sloppy, slippy, muddy, greasy, sooty, dark and stinking ; with a few gaslights burning here and there, aB if to show that light in the great metropolis could be obtained by no other means than artificial ones. A nasty damp, misty fog fell heavily, aud had been falling all day long, which struck at once tbe ague or rhuematism into your bones. Through this fog the men held their solitary way, even though in the midst of living thousands, followed only by Amelia. The ceremony was soon gabbled over, and enough earth thrown on the coffin to hide it from the sight, aud then left until another body came and helped to fill up the hole. With saddened and disgusted feelings Amelia returned home by herself; her mind, however, was too restless to permit her to stay long in one place. It was lonely, too, to sit in her room with no one else but Joey. She could not help, for the moment, praying for her aunt back again ; she felt she could rather endure the severe hard work and her aunt's constant reproach, than the loneliness of that room. Mrs. Jackson had thought that it would be so. She, therefore, as soon as she had arranged a few little matters of her own, came up to Amelia and tried to make her as cheerful as possible ; for which at tention Amelia said \" she hardly knew how to thank her.\" Is it not strange how very agreeable interest can make one? On the morning after the funeral, Amelia, after having got Susan Green who was staying at home that morning to take care of Joey, made her way to Mrs. Jennings for the purpose of getting some work. \" Good morning, Miss Pratt,\" exclaimed Mrs. Jennings, as she saw Amelia enter. \" Good morning, ma'am,\" returned Amelia. \"So you've buried your aunt at last,\" continued Mrs. Jennings. \" It must have been a happy release \u2014 poor soul !\" Amelia made no reply. \" But there was a little boy, was there not ?\" demanded Mrs, Jennings. \" Yes,\" returned Amelia. \" I thought so, what's become of him ?' \" He is with me,\" answered Amelia. \" Indeed !\" exclaimed Mrs. Jennings ; but you surely are not going to keep him ?\" \" Yes, I am,\" returned Amelia. '\u2022 Why, what madness !\" ejaculated Mrs. Jennings, \" Who is there to keep him ?\" asked Amelia."], [175, "aunt Eliza's garret. 151 \" Why, the parish is better able to do so than you are. Why, he will always be a clog to you ; you'll never get any sweethearts, gal.\" \" Oh, do not jest with me, Mrs. Jennings,\" exclaimed Amelia, \" my heart, is too full with trouble at present to bear it.\" \" Tm sorry to hear it.\" \" I have come to see if I can have any work,\" continued Amelia, trying to look as composedly as 6he possibly could. \" Indeed !\" exclaimed Mrs. Jennings. 44 And now that's all over,\" still continued Amelia, \" I dare say I shall be able to help you more regularly than I have done for some little time past.\" \" I have no work now,\" returned Mrs. Jennings. \" I am sorry to hear it,\" faintly replied Amelia. \u00ab\u25a0 Are you slack ?\" \"About as usual,\" exclaimed Mrs. Jennings, \"but, you see, while you were so uncertain in your work, I had to get this young lady to come and help, (pointing to a new face) and I cannot now turn her away to make room for you.\" \" I am sorry to hear it,\" murmured Amelia. \" So am I,\" continued Mrs. Jennings, \" but it wouldn't be right to put one on and off, at a minute's notice, making her my cat's-paw like ; but, of course, if there's a vacancy I should be glad to see you among us again.\" CHAPTER XXVI. Amelia made her way into the street without scarcely speaking again to Mrs. Jennings. She was completely bewildered. This last misfor- tune was the least expected of any. Mrs. Jennings had always showed so much attention to her, and had been so lenient during her aunt's illness, that Amelia had depended upon being still employed by her. Once more was she thrown upon the world to seek fresh employment. In a few minutes her faculties recovered from the blow that they had j ust received, and recollecting that she had seen a bill in a shop window for braiding hands, she went straightway towards it. Entering the shop she asked for work. The man at the counter stared rudely at her for a moment ; and then, turning to another yv>ung man who was standing a little way from him, winked, as he"], [176, "152 aunt eliza's garret. thought very wittily, and bringing the tip of his forefinger in contact with the tip of his nose, exclaimed in an under tone : \u2014 \" We are 4 a young afflicted,' ain't us ?\" \" Werry strong symptoms of the desease,\" returned the other, aiming at wit, in his pronunciation. \" She's rather a nice bit, too,\" returned the first. \" Ah ! pretty fair, rather an ugly nose, though,\" replied the second. \" Well, you can't always have perfection,\" continued the first ; and then turning to Amelia he said : \u2014 \" So, my dear, you want some work, do you ?\" Yes, if you please,\" returned Amelia, What can you do ?\" Anything.\" \" The deuce you can !\" exclaimed the young man, trying to look very captivating. \" That is,\" returned Amelia, blnshing and hanging down her head, for the bold look of the man she was speaking to made her feel un comfortable, \" I mean I can do braiding and embroidery ; I have also served my time as dressmaker to Madame Dupont, in Regent-street, and have been working for Mrs. Jennings, the drawn-bonnet maker, in Newgate-street.\" \" Oh!\" exclaimed the young man. \"Well, we can give you some braiding if you like to take it.\" \" Thank you,\" returned Amelia. \" Just hand me that roll of alpaca, Brown.\" Brown did as he was desired, when the young gentleman repaid him tor his trouble by saying : \u2014 \" Oh, d \u2014 n it, she's a regular old stager ;\" whereupon Brown turned up his nose to express his contempt for the object of the remark. \" There, that's the pattern, and we pay sixpence a dress.\" \" It's very heavy,\" exclaimed Amelia. \" You all say that ; if you don't like to do it, there's plenty more that will.\" \"Well. I'll try and see if I can do anything with it,\" returned Amelia, \"better do that than nothing at all.\" \" Where do you live?\" The address was given. \" I'll send it over directly. Oh, here's the boy, he can go and carry it for you\" \" Very well,\" returned Amelia, and immediately left the shop. As soon as she reached home she sat down to her work with a right \u2022rood will. She was thankful that she had obtained it so soon. Bad"], [177, "aunt eliza's garret. 153 as it was, it was better than \"nothing. After ten hours' continuous hard labour, she had succeeded in finishing one dress, the remuneration for which was to be the enormous sum of sixpence ! Ten hours' labour .for sixpence! Three shillings a week, to keep two living souls! to pay rent and find food ! Three shillings ! Is it not, reader, a large reward for hard and honest labour? Why, roguery iu a prison is better treated ! A girl who strives to keep life in two hnman beings receives three shillings per week, and dies, possibly, at last by starvation. The man who destroys life is fed sumptuously every day ; and, though he dies, mercy is still shown him in the endeavour to end his sufferings as quickly as possible. And then, too, we must not forget the fact that, if you won't do it there is plenty of others that will. Yes; so poor, so crushed and trodden down, with yet some honest spark still lingering in the breast , there is a \" plenty\" iu this great metropolis who are all but ready to quarrel with their fellow sufferers for this paltry sum, and to work hard \u2014 oh, very hard \u2014 for it, too ! As a means to curtail expenses, Amelia and Susan Green agreed to share the same room. Susan, therefore, moved her things from her own room into Amelia's ; an arrangement which pleased Mrs. Jackson greatly ; because, she would then have another room to let, aud stand a better chance of getting her rent from Amelia. For some weeks Amelia continued to work at the braiding, never leaving off until she had been at it for fifteen hours a day. During all this time she never let Joey want a meal ; but always debarred herself of her own share, rather than that he should go without. There -was one thing, however, which greatly annoyed her. Susan had began to stay out very late at night ; often not coming home until early in the morning; and at times in a very excited state. Yet, notwithstanding this, her conduct in all other respects, was the same to Amelia as it had ever been. On one occasion when Susan came home she found Amelia still up. \"What at work!\" exclaimed Susan, as she entered the room and began to throw off her bonnet and shawl. \" Yes,\" returned Amelia, with a sigh. \" I have to get these into the warehouse in the morning early.\" \u2022'And so have been working all night to do it,'' ejaculated Susan. \"Yes.\" \" That's more than I would.\" \" I might lose the work if I didn't,\" answered Amelia. \" Well, I would lose it then,\" returned Susan, very much excited,"], [178, "aunt eliza's garret. 154 \" I have done the same kind of thing often enough, I won't do it again. though.\" \" What do you mean, Susan V asked Amelia. 41 Mean! Why, that there's more ways than one to get money,\" returned Susan. \" Not honestly,\" exclaimed Amelia. 41 1 don't steal,\" answered Susan ; \" as far as that goes I fancy I'm as honest as my neighbours.\" \" And in everything else, too, I hope,\" returned Amelia. \" Well, I don't know ; if we reckon up each other's faults, there may lie some a great deal worse than I am. For what I am, God knows I am not in my heart,\" exclaimed Susan, bursting into tears, at)d falling on her knees buried her face in Amelia's lap. \" Come, come, Susan dear,\" exclaimed Amelia, \" don't cry ; tell me what is the matter. We are together here, without a friend besides ourselves to help us ; it would be hard, indeed, if we could not console each other. What is it, Susan ?\" \" See here,\" exclaimed Susan, Bhowing an open-worked purse, with gold glittering between the openings. \" Gold !\" exclaimed Amelia, pushing back her chair, and with fright depicted on her countenance, stared wildly at her. \" Yes,\" returned Susan, \"the cure for every sorrow.\" 41 Good God !\" ejaculated Amelia, after a pause. \" How did you get it r \" I didn't steal it,\" returned Susan, with her head cast down. \" Is it possible that you have \u2014 '!\" Amelia could proceed no farther, their eyes met, and they read each other's thoughts. \" Oh, my God, Susan ! what will become of you ?\" \"And do you spurn me for the first?\" asked Susan, rather bitterly. \" God forbid !\" exclaimed Amelia, throwing her arms round her neck ; \" but I feel wretched at the very thought of what you would have me believe. I have so long seared it and it has come at last.\" For some time they were silent. \" I could not help it,\" exclaimed Susan, at length ; \" I could not, indeed ! You seem to doubt my word. For a long time I have hardly known how to keep things going ; and on one or two occasions I have pawned some of my work to do it. I couldn't get it out again when I wanted it, so I got things of the tally for the purpose of pawning them to get my work out. I put 'em away to make the money. In two weeks I lest off paying, and then I was summoned and ordered to"], [179, "AUST eliza's garret 155 pay by a certain time, and if I didn't I was to go to prison. Why, bless you, I couldn't no more pay it then than at first. To day is the last day given me. I did all I could to get it up, but it was no use. I even pawned some of my work to make it up. When I went into the shop they asked me for the work. I felt stupid like.lut had enough sense to say I would bring it in presently. Luckily for me I hadn't paid the money into the court. So I went back again to the pawn brokers and got my work out, and then run back with it to the shop. I got there just in time to save my being had before a magistrate. They had been told about it, I'm sure ; because when I went in they said there would be no more work for me. I was then w orse off than I was before I pawned 'em, because I had to pay the interest. Then what was I to do, I was only out of prison on grace. The tally had heard that I pawned his goods without making them up, and he threatened to indict me for getting goods under false peetences. I have long been tempted to do what I have done this very night, but I always shuddered at it ; the fear of going to prison drove me to it at last, and I am what I am, to save myself from worse. I am what many other's are \u2014 driven to it by the hard grindings of rich Jewish masters.\" \" You are to be pitied, Susan, indeed you are, \" said Amelia ; \" but come, you are tired now and excited ; you have been drinking, too.\" \"I could not get devil enough in me until I had had some drink,\" returned Susan, the tears running copiously down her cheeks. \"Well, well, don't thi_>k about it now,\" continued Amelia ; \"un dress and go to bed.\" After some persuasion, Susan did as Amelia desired. She soon fell into a sound slumber, the effects of the wine she had taken Amelia, tired aud exhausted, soon after retired likewise ; not to sleep, but to ponder over\" poor lost Susan.\" In the morning Susan was the first to wake. Her thoughts were of the bitterest ! As she .cast her eyes upon Amelia, who was slightly dosing, she gently pressed her lips upon hers, murmuring to herself 41 poor girl, she's too good, an ocean deal too good, for me ! We must part.\" The slight itouch awoke Amelia, who, as she opeued her eyes ex claimed \" poor Susan !\" Then with the impulsive feeling of girlhood they warmly embraced each other. \" It h late,\" at.length exclaimed Amelia, \" I must hurry into the warehouse ; you get what breakfast there is and feed Joey for me, I won't be long.\" Amelia was as good as her word, but her surprise was great indeed"], [180, "156 aunt eliza's garret. when, on her return, she saw on the table, not the scanty breakfast she had expected, but an abuudant meal. The colour rose to her cheek as she viewed it, and then turning a somewhat reproachful look upon Susan, she exclaimed ; \u2014 \" Oh, Susan !\" \" I did it for the best,\" returned Susan, in a trembling voice. \" Oh ! don't look so, Meeley, that hurts me more than I can tell. It is the last meal that we may have together, and I got it to show my love for you.\" \" The last meal, Susan, what do yon mean ?\" \" I have made my mind up that it would be better for you if I lest you. Yes, Amelia, you are good now, and I am not fit for you. I knew you wouldn't take any other present ; it would come to you as the fruit of my \u2014 .\" *' Susan, one wrong step don't make a life of sin. Stop were you are, God knows we both want support,\" exclaimed Amelia, energetically. Susan only replied with a shake of the head. \" But don't do anything rash,\" continued Amelia. \" There's no need to let all the world know what's happened. If you were to go now, at once, our landlady would wonder what on earth was the cause.\" \" May God's bitter curse wither her !\" exclaimed Susan, passionately stamping her feet. \"Ob, Susan,\" cried Amelia, \"what a wicked prayer !\" 44 It is the prayer of my heart,\" returned Susan. \" It is to her I owe the thanks of being made what I am.\" \"To her!'' exclaimed Amelia, shudderingly. \" Yes. If I had been left to myself, I should have gone away and trusted to chance about paying the man ; but she \u2014 God curse her ! \u2014 watched me every minute, and threw me in the tempter's way. For nights I've kept away to escape her ; but, never mind, I frighten you. I feel my whole nature changed now, I don't feel like I did yesterday ; there seems so much of the devil in me.\" \" Ob, Susan, don't talk so,\" exclaimed Amelia, drawing closer to her and gently-winding her arm round her neck. The flushed cheek and flashing eye were changed in an instant, and tears again found their way down her face. \" Oh, if all were like you !\" exclaimed Susan, sobbing. \" God forbid that they should be !\" returned Amelia. \" You do not know me ; I do not know myself. I can tell you that there is, at times, hard work going on here.\" As she spoke she placed her hand upon her breast. \"If I had been tempted as you have, I would"], [181, "AUNT ELIZA'S GARRET. 157 not answer for the consequence ! God knows what will become of me ! and poor George, too, no tidings yet of him aud no money.\" 44 You wrong yourself, indeed you do, or but say it to comfort me ; but, there, crying is no use now. Come, the coffee will be getting cold ; and all our regrets will do no good, bo come along.\" As she said this she put on as bright a countenauce as possible, and hurried about trying to forget her thoughts in what she was doing. Amelia sat down and endeavoured by all those little acts which one woman can perform for another, to show that notwithstanding-all that had happened, she did not wish to hurt her already wounded feelings, but to render her as much consolation as it was in her power to give. As soon as the meal was over, Susan put on her bonnet and shawl and prepared to leave the room. \" Where are you going ?\" demanded Amelia. \" To pay the tally, and to get another lodging,\" returned Susan. \" Then you are determined to leave me ?\" asked Amelia, sorrowfully. \"Yes ; it is the best. If you had treated me shabbily, I should not have cared a straw about it ; but, as it is, I might draw you down too.\" She then gave Amelia a hasty kiss, and rushed from the room. With a heavy heart Amelia cleared away the remnants of the breakfast, gave Joey his few playthings, and sat down to her work. Oh, how fast her fingers plied the needle ! Oh, how great the stimulant she had for doing so ! The dread that she might fall the same as Susan had, gave her renewed strength and renewed hope. About dinner time Susan again returned. She had released herself from the shackles of the tallyman \u2014 but at what cost ! \u2014 and had suc ceeded in obtaining another lodging. \" And so you've got a room !\" exclaimed Amelia in surprise ; \" why, I tried every day for a week and didn't get one.\" \" I'm not particular to a shade,\" replied Susan ; \" you aimed at cheapness and respectability. It's rather difficult, I fancy, to find poverty respected ; it's against the order of things. And now then to pack up my traps.\" So saying she at once commenced sorting out her own things from Amelia's. As she did so, she threw out many little articles which she thought might be useful to Amelia, who, upon remonstrating with her, was met by the reply, \" I have plenty now ; you may have these, for they were got by hard work. When I'm poor again, why, perhaps, you may be able to help me.\" Amelia made no answer ; but, when she saw that she was determined to go, lent her a helping hand. \u00a5 But there's your bedstead.\""], [182, "158 AUST ELIZA'S GARRET. \" I'll leave that in your care. I would give it you entirely, but it was my mother's.\" And Susan again showed symptoms of crying, but brushing the tears away, she continued, \" and that's all, I think ; and nothing now remains but to say, good by !\" \" Good by !\" returned Amelia ; \" but you will come and see me.\" \" I had better not.\" \"You'll feel lonely and unhappy at times; your better self will occasionally want some other companions, perhaps, than those who may be about you. If, then, you should want a friend, come to me, Susan, and as far as kind words and simple acts go, they are yours.\" \" God bless you !\" returned Susan. \" Good by.\" 41 Good by ! God bless you !\" returned Amelia, and after embracing each other, they separated. CHAPTER XXVII. Four months bad passed since Amelia and Susan Green had parted, during which time Amelia had neither seen nor heard of her former companion. Amelia was still in the same room working with an almost untiring energy. Joey was lying on the bed, and on the mantle piece stood a couple of doctor's bottles half full of medicine. Desease had fallen upon Joey. Amelia had taken him to a physician and had begged him to look at Joey and prescribe for him. The doctor was a venerable looking man, living near Finsbury-square, and noted for his charitable disposition. He freely listened to Amelia, and readily gave his advice ; but when asked if there were any danger, he gravely shook his head, and replied by saying : \u2014 \" He is young, that is in his favour ; he only wants good food, pure air, and good nursing. If he have them he may grow up a man, otherwise I cannot hold out much hope for his recovery. Medidne I fear, will be of little use without he have them.'' \" Good food, pure air, and good nursing,\" murmured Amelia, as she walked home, \" how am I to obtain the one or to give the other ? Oh what a wretched world this is to live in !\" If possible, Amelia worked harder than ever to earn a little extra wherewith to buy medicine ; but such energy could not last for ever \u2022"], [183, "AUNT ELIZA'S GARBET. 159 her strength soon failed, and she found it wiser to take more rest ; then again the food fell short, and Joey got weaker daily. On one evening, as Amelia sat hard at work, her thoughts were fixed on Susan Green, wondering if she had indeed bettered her situation by the step she had taken ; and if her protector were, indeed, truly kind to her. Her sight, through weakness, seemed failing her, yet with a strong effort she slightly recovered and proceeded with her work ; but the more she strove the less she did. Her last penny had been expended in buying Joey's arrowroot. She had had no food since the morning ! Oh, how she wished she knew where Susan was, so that she could go to her and borrow a few pence to enable her to struggle on until the next morning ! At that instant some one tapped at the door. \" Come in,\" exclaimed Amelia. The door opened, and lo ! Susan entered. \"I'm come to see you at last,\" she said, as she turned to fasten the door, \" I hope I'm welcome.\" \"What, Susan! is it you? I thought you had forgotten me. I was just thinking of you ; in fact, you have been constantly in my mind since you left.\" \" As the lost one, I suppose,\" said Susan, rather bitterly. \" Well, never mind, I have not worked so hard since, we parted, and yet am better off and in better health, that's everything.\" Susan spoke the truth : her whole appearance was greatly improved, hunger had been satisfied, the body clothed, and her mind sufficiently strong to keep temperate in all things. 14 You have work, then !\" said Amelia, in surprise. \"Yes, I always make a point of working.\" \" How neatly you are dressed, too.\" 44 Yes, and what's more, it is my own and paid for. There's a slight difference in that respect between us, ain't there ?\" 44 And in a good many other things, too,\" returned Amdia. \" I know it, or I should not have been here to-night\" \" Indeed !\" exclaimed Amelia. 41 Joey is ill, ain't he ?\" \" Yes, very ill.\" \" And you have got to nurse him and to find him in physic out of your earnings ?\" continued Susan. \" It's a hard trial,\" returned Amelia, \" I hope he'll soon get better.' 41 It ain't likely,\" returned Susan, \"you half-starve yourself to feed him ; your strength must fail ; what'll become of him then ?\" \" I hope things will alter for the better,\" sighed Amdia."], [184, "160 AUNT ELIZA'S GARRET. 41 I've come to-night,\" continued Susan, \"to see for myself how he and you really were. Ive come to watch by him while you sleep, and to offer you whatever is in my power to give.\" \" God bless you, Susan,\" exclaimed Amelia, \"you are very kind.\" \" And you are very tired,\" still continued Susan, \" I see it in your face ; you are not half the girl you was three months ago.\" \" If I speak the truth, Susan,\" returned Amelia, \" I must confess that I am very ill.\" \"You look so. Come now, put that work away, and go to bed. You must make much of it to-night ; it is quite uncertain when I shall be able to come again.\" \" Oh, Susan !\" exclaimed Amelia, \" I have eaten nothing since the morning.\" \" Poor thing !\" said Susan, a tear springing to her eye, but brushing it suddenly away and assuming a careless tone, she continued, \" let me help you into bed, and then I'll run and get you something.\" With affectionate zeal Susan got a light and wholesome supper for her friend ; then, whilst Amelia was partaking of it she' made up the fire, gave Joey his medicine and a bran new toy, painted the gayest colours. In less than an hour from the time Susan entered the room, Amelia and Joey were in a healthy sleep ; then Susan sat down before the fire, and for the first time for many days, experienced a sensation somewhat akin to happiness. In the morning Amelia awoke refreshed. She felt as if she had received fresh strength and energy ; but when she looked round the room for Susan, she was not to be seen ; she had gone. The breakfast had been prepared, a bright fire was burning in the hearth, and on the corner of the table a few shillings were lying. Amelia arose at once. Joey still slept. In a few minutes she was engaged with her work. The money she carefully put by, determining to use it only as the last resource. She had not been long at work before Mrs. Jackson entered. \" Good morning, my dear,\" she exclaimed, as she walked into the room, \"and how's Joey this morning?\" \" He seems a little better,\" returned Amelia. \" Been into the warehouse T continued Mrs. Jackson. No.' 41 Indeed! I thought you hadn't got any money yesterday.\" \" Nor had I,\" returned Amelia. 44 Been getting trust, p'r'aps ?\" 44 No, nor have I been getting trust.\" \" Oh, of course, I don't want to know your secret, if it is one,' exclaimed Mrs. Jackson, rather uneasily."], [185, "AUNT ELIZA'S GARRET. 161 \" Nor is it a secret,\" continued Amelia. \" Susan came last night, and brought me some supper and other things ; but when she left you know as much as I do, perhaps better, for I was fast asleep at the time.\" As Susan's name was mentioned, Mrs. Jackson grew uneasy ; she was in doubt whether Amelia had been enlightened as to her own character. If Amelia were still ignorant, she was rather pleased with Susan's visit than otherwise ; though it might delay her scheme some few days' longer, it might make success more sure. Amelia could not be off from making comparisons between Susan's comparative ease and her own poverty. So after making some hurried remarks, and just giving a hint that her landlord was pressing her hard for some money, and how she was to make it up she did not know, left the room. Time still flew onward, and another three months had passed and Amelia had neither seen Susan nor heard from her. Joey was now so thin and ill that, to all appearance, he was nothing but a skeleton. Amelia had struggled bravely against everything, but still the boy continued to sink and waste away. Amelia was again penniless ; the money Susan had lest her had vanished long ago. Joey had been for some hours without food, and was now crying for some. Amelia had none to give him, and, to add to her misfortune, she had been out of work for the last four days. The few things she had had, had found their way to the pawnbroker's, and she had nothing now which she could turn to money. For some time she paced her room in the grestest agony of mind and body; at length she exclaimed \u2014 \"My promise to my aunt must be fulfilled at any risks ; and, perhaps, after all he may have some feeliug of humanity within him ; come what may I'll try.\" Having determined how she would act, her mind seemed more calm ; and giving Joey the last dose of medicine, which, by the way, contained a great portion of laudanum, she sung him to sleep,\u2014 oh ! what were her feelings at that moment '.\u2014wrapped him up as warmly as she could, kissd him, laid him on the bed, and promised him, within herself, that on the morrow he should be better provided for. In turning over some of the pawnbrokers' duplicates for the purpose of selling them, if possible, she fouud a card which she thought had, months ago, been destroyed. She had then thrown it on one side with indignation, now she was determined to use it. He who had presented her with it, had often met her in Regent-street when she worked for Madame Dupont, and^iad promised that she should never want if she"], [186, "162 AUNT ELIZA'S GARRET. would become his companion. She had treated him and his offers with indignation, and returned his notes unanswered. All the time she was with Madame Dupont he persevered in his proposal ; but when Amelia left, he lost sight of her and troubled himself no more about her, Borne other whim, perhaps, leading his attentions elsewhere. Amelia, anxious about Joey and desirous to fusil the promise she made her aunt at the time of her death, was determined to seek out this man of wealth and, if possible, to borrow some money from him. She could not be lieve, or rather she did not wish to believe, that any man could be so lost to all feeling of humanity as to wish, at such a moment, to take advantage of one situated as she was. Taking the soiled card in her hand she left the room and soon was standing in the street. Pulling her scanty dothing closer to her and ending her head down, the better to meet the wind and beating rain, she hurried on towards Hoi born. Turning down Southampton Street she passed along it, crossed Bloomsbury Square, and then proceeded down one of the streets that lead backward from the Museum. In a few minutes she arrived at her destination. For a moment her courage failed. The house before which she stopped looked dark and dismal, and had it not been for its size and situation, no one would have supposed that a man of wealth lived there. One thought of Joey revived her drooping courage, and with a nervous haste she pulled the visitors'' bell. The door swung on its hinges and the porter looked forth into the street, as if in expectation of seeing some carriage standing there. 14 Is that gentleman at home ?\" asked Amelia, handing the card to the porter, who took it from her, and after first staring at the card and then at her, said : \u2014 \" Step inside, I'll see.\" Amelia did as she was desired. The porter disappeared and after a short time returned, accompanied by a man dressed somewhat like a dissenting minister. \" Is this the lady?\" he asked of the porter. \" Yes.\" \" You wish to see Sir William ?\" he said, turning to Amelia. \"If you please.\" \" Step this way, if you please, and I will ascertain if he can see you.\" Amelia followed her conductor into a small, well-furnished, apart ment. A bright sire was burning in the stove, and all that cunning could devise for bodily comfort was to be found in that room. What a contrast when compared with her own wretched garret !"], [187, "AUNT ELIZA'S GARRET. 163 \"1 will inform Sir William of your presence,\" said the man, who was no other than Sir William's valet, as he placed an arm chair before the fire and motioned Amelia to be seated. Is it not strange how seldom Satan disappoints his victim at the first step. It was rarely Sir William \u2014 who by the way was a widower \u2014 was at home at the hour at which Amelia called ; something unusual had detained him this evening, as if for the very purpose of adding the last drop which should fill Amelia's cnp of bitterness to overflowing. Amelia seated herself in the chair and commenced warming herself by the fire. Her eye, as it gazed on the burning coal, possessed an unearthly expression of determination, for Despair and Recklessness had usurped the throne left vacant by the flight of Hope ; her breath was short and quick ; her heart palpitated violently which, with the sharp walk she had ju3t had, flushed her cheek and added something to her appearance. While she was seated in that room the valet made his way to Sir William, who was slowly dressing for an evening party. \" Ah ! so that girl has come at last,\" said Sir William, in a drawl, \"she has taken an immense time in arriving to a resolution. Dear me, if I mistake not, it is many weeks since I saw her in Regent Street. Hand me my diary for the last season. Thank you. Ah, here it is. I consider this very fortunate ; I shall still persevere in this plan ; it is positively so far back as the middle of last season that I made her a most liberal offer. She must be considerably altered in appearance since then. Ah, tell her to call some other time.\" \" I think, Sir William, she will not do that,\" said the valet. \" Indeed ! and may I be permitted to ask your reasons for drawing such a conclusion ?\" said Sir William, dipping his delicately formed fingers into a gold snuff-box. \" There's desperation stamped upon her face. It has been a severe trial on her part to seek relief from your hands. You may depend upon the truth of what I say, Sir William.\" \" Positively !\" \" If you refuse her an audience she will not ask a second time.\" \" Dear me, you surprise me ! Is there any circumstance extra ordinary in her bearing ?\" demanded Sir William. \" There's a quiet wildness, if you can understand me, Sir William, that shows a settled resolve,\" returned the valet.\" \"Positively, I must confe.s I always thought that there was some thing very peculiar about that creature. I think I'll see her for the novelty of the thing. ' A quiet wildness.' I fancy there must be something original about her; indeed, if I am not mistaken, that expression of yours is new. May I trouble you for my dressing gown 1"], [188, "164 aunt eliza's garret. Thank you. ' A quiet wildness.\" 1 have met very devils as regards passion ; perfect volcanoes. I rather admire that, it's exciting ; but ' a quiet wildness' I do not remember to have witnessed ; remind me to refer, will you'.'\" Having thrown ou his dressing gown he proceeded to see Amelia. As Sir William entered, Amelia rose from her seat and slightly bowed. \" Ah, my dear creature !\" exclaimed Sir William, with all the enthusiasm of a devoted lover \u2014 a vast contrast to the Sir William of the dressing room. \"You do me infinite pleasure by this visit; I fancied you had forgotten me. I have missed you in my usual promenade for some time past. Pray be seated. Pardon me, but you are some what thinner than when I last saw you ; are you unwell ?\" \" Both in mind and body, Sir William,\" said Amelia, calmly. \"I am grieved to hear it.\" A slight sarcastic smile played for a moment on Amelia'3 lip ; she evidently held tbe expression at its real value . \" You seem fatigued,\" he continued, \" possibly you have just lest your employment.\" \" I am fatigued, Sir William,\" replied Amelia, putting great emphasis upon her words. You are, however, mistaken in your supposition ; I have had no work for the last four days.\" \" Indeed !\" \u2022'Nor food for at least twelve hours.\" \" Dear me ! You would of course be glad of some refreshment,\" said Sir William, at the same time touching the bell, inwardly remarking \u2014 \" Damme ! there's something very superior about her \u2014 very ; in fact, always thought so : fine figure ; show well ; equal if not superior to any I know; thin, decidedly; bad living, a month or so at the sea side would cure that and render her a prize worth introducing to my friends. Lord. Littlewit decidedly beat us all at our last re-union, in picking up the finest woman ; certainly she wa3 a disgustingly vulgar wretch ; but here I fancy I have both the beauty and the lady.\" \" That was not the purpose of my visit,\" said Amelia. \" Let covers be laid at once for two \u2014 let there be not five minutes' delay,\" said Sir William to a domestic who had answered his summons j then turning to Amelia, he continued, \u2014 \" May I ask to what I am indebted for the pleasure of this visit.\" \" I came, Sir William, to beg your help. I am without work and without money. I have intrusted to my care a young child \u2014 a cousin \u2014 to whose mother I promir-ed, at her dying hour, I would never leave bim nor suffer him to want, if there were means within my power to save him from it.\""], [189, "aunt eliza's garret. 165 \"Bless my soul, you surprise me ! What extraordinary self-denial!\" exclaimed Sir William. \" That child is sick, is dying for the want of food !\" contained Amelia, fixing her large, expressive eye upon Sir William. \" Dear me ! but we will discuss that matter presently.\" \" No, Sir William, we will discuss it now if you please.\" \" But will you not take some refreshment ?\" \" When I have taken refreshment to that poor child.\" \" As you please ; proceed.\" \" I have struggled for months and months to keep myself and that poor child, aud might, perhaps, have continued to struggle, bad not work ceased altogether. In this situation I, the poor, half-starved needle girl, have come to you, the rich and well-fed man of rank, to beg the loan of just enough to keep life within that poor, sick child, until I can work again for him.\" As she finished speaking she buried her face in her hands and wept bitterly. It was seldom that her feelings gave vent in tears ; but now they did, and she gained relies accordingly and a stronger nerve. \"I nes-er lend,\" returned Sir William. \" Oh, Sir William, break through a rule for once ; it will cost you but a trifle, a mere drop taken from the ocean ; and it will return to you with a woman's prayer for blessings on your head.\" \" Allow me to repeat, my dear creature, that I never lend ; but I give, and, I hope, give liberally, upon conditions.\" \" Oh, sir, it is cruel, inhuman, at such a time to hint at those terms ! Oh, if there's pity in your breast, on my knees I implore \u2014 !\" \" Permit me, madam, I cannot suffer this ; it disturbs the tranquility and equilibrium of my nerves ; and besides, we both are wasting time. This young child of yours may be waiting anxiously your return, perhaps dying ; you know the conditions upon which I am ready to assist you ; consent, and you as well as and the child in whom you re so intearested, are provided for.\" Tor some moments Amelia remained upon her knees, with her face buried in her hands. At length she rose from her suppliant posture ; but, oh ! how pale her cheek, how bright her eye, as she said, gazing fixedly upon Sir William,\u2014 \" give me gold, and I am yours !\" Sir William, who considered that it was beneath his dignity to allow for a moment an expression of surprise to rest upon his countenance, could not prevent his eye and lip from expressing the pleasure which the devil within him felt at the success that gold had obtained over virtue. Amelia saw it not, but with a sigh sank back into the chair insensible. 11"], [190, "aunt eliza's garret. 166 Now Sir William was a respectable man. Firstly, because h' WU rich. Secondly, because he was a man of title and related to many noble families, and had some of tbe most aristocratic blood, in fact, to use liis own words, \"some of England's best blood\" coursing through his arteries. God forbid! \u2014 Thirdly, because he was a strict Cliui- b of England man ; always attending his church on the Sunday, and never omitting to partake of the sacrament. And, fourthly, because cribed to many charitable institutions. If the malicious brought any charge against him, his friends, of course, did not believe it, or, at the best, looked upon it as some fashionable folly \u2014 and, of course, excusable \u2014 which some democratic fanatic had exaggerated. Now we would ask Sir William \u2014 this man of strict Church-of- England principles \u2014 how he can reconcile his belief in a God when he thinks of bis victims who, lured by his gold, have yielded to his wishes? How this man who, every Sunday as he stands iu the midst of a fashionable congregation of would-be-considered worshippers of one holy, jllst, and true God. repeats his belief, or signifies his belies by his presence, <-an come from that temple and with the words ringing in his ears, \" t! ou shalt not commit adultery,'' and commit such acts is certainly a mystery to us. But such men there are, and they walk through the streets picking up the victims of their passions as butchers walk tbrongh Smithfield market, and with a somewhat similar expres sion of delight do these respectable men purchase thdr victims as butchers purchase an extraordinary fine ox or sheep. Sir William is a respectable man ! a man of strictly moral principles! and gives largely to charitable institutions'. But, Sir William, not withstanding that some of England's best blood flows in his veins, can and does, when a poor, hardworked, badly paid and badly fed -girl applies to him for a small loan to keep life in a starving babe, drive a hard bargain; and before one copper piece of his great ! crosses the palm of her hand, she must bind herself to become his mistress. At such a time, when he sees and hears the convulsive sobs, when he sees what mischief poverty aud hardwork have done to that poor attenuated frame ; when he sees necessity overcoming disgust, how is it that this respectable man \u2014 this man who communicates on the first Sunday of every month \u2014 how is it that he does not think of the ..ora i, \" to whom much is given, of him much shall be required?'- Or does he \u00bbuppose that by squandering his money to gratify his passion is the proper interpretation of those words ? Sir William is a respectable man, moreover an aristocratic man, vices merely fashionable folliee ; and those wLo charge him ly crime are democratic villains, who delight to exaggerate th*"], [191, "AUNT ELIZA'S GARRET. 167 rich man's follies to create more discontent iu the poor .pan's mind. Yet with this idea expressed \u2014 perhaps, not believed in \u2014 this very respectable man, who is ready to shed the last drop of his \" best blood of England\" to uphold the laws and the aristocracy, does not for a moment entertain tbe idea that the best method to be adopted to uphold the laws and the aristocracy is, to make that aristocracy respected, and not by such acts of forced purchases make their very name stink in the uostrils of the poor. Does not this charitable man, who would uphold Church and State, think it would be upheld on a stronger foundation, if those, who are so ready to speak in bitterness against it, were to find that those who profess to be of strict Church-of- England principles were to act more consistently with their professed belief. As it is, what conclusion can these \" democratic disturbers of the peace\" come to ? Why simply that, notwithstanding the vast amount of boasted Christianity, there, in reality, exists but little belief in it ; and that many of the professed believers in it are in their hearts disbelievers and atheists, selfishly grasping at the sensual pleasures of the world. These opinions find their way down the ladder of life ; disbelief becomes engendered in the minds of the poor ; a desire to enjoy, as well as tbe rich, a life of ease and luxury, begets discontent, and this, with the fear of future punish ment destroyed, begets crime. Can there then exist any wonder that we find so many blighted blossoms of womanhood living upon the wages of vice 1 With some, the conduct of such men as Sir William produces a different effect. They perceive the evil and attribute it to the fault of the church ; they attempt to reform it and through their fanatic ravings produce an equal amount of disgust as the immoral conduct of Sir William. Home missionaries are sent round to the poor, they thrust themselves into their dwellings and commence at once upon tbe subject of their mission. If the poor creatures whom these missionaries visit sin, they are threatened with future damnation ; but who takes the trouble to check the rich man holding out temptation? What mis sionary calls on him and tells him that he only has bis wealth in trust that he may benefit his less fortunate brethren ; and to show him the good that he might do with his wealth to this or that poor family before whom some hour or so since he had said iu prayer \" keep us from temptation ;\" and what is so great a temptation as the promise of home, ease and plenty, to a weak frame aud a starving stomach? Can we wonder at weak humanity falling when, at such times, temp tation is thrown with unceasing perseverance in its way ? Fall it doe.., _uud the men going about professing to lie die ministers of Christ"], [192, "168 AUNT ELIZA'S GARRET. threaten mankind with eternal torture ; but yet not one step is taken to remove the temptation. The cry goes through the land, and each and every one takes up the song of the poor man's wrongs, but what has been done when compared with the amount required to be done, to alleviate his sufferings ? Why we have transported a few thousands to Australia, it matters little what were their characters or dispositions, they were the scrofula that disfigured the fair complexion of England's skin, and so we took what seemed the easiest remedy; we drove the disgusting blotch from the sight, and did not care whether the disease were cured or sent deeper into the constitution. It relieved a little for the time, but it must break out again ; and as each day passes the poor sempstress will become still more degraded and her name another word for wanton ; whilst meu of the Sir William class but bring an odium upon the really charitable, and make our discontented, whose passions and ill-tutored minds prevent them from seeing who are their friends or foes. Soon afterwards Amelia lest the house, richer than when she had entered by some pounds, a bankrupt in woman's dearest coin ; for she had promised to become the companion of a man she hated. Careless and bold, with all the woman's finer feelings paralysed \u2014 strange contrast to the girl of some two hours since \u2014 -she hurried back into Holborn. Her life was to her like a pitchy night, with only one star dimly visible in the heavens above -, that star was Joey. A few shops were still open; she, therefore, hurriedly purchased such articles as were most needed, and calling a cab ordered to be driven homewards as fast as possible. When arrived at the corner of the court in which she lived she alighted hastily, and running frantically to the door she threw it open and flew upstairs. Upon enteiing her room she found Susan Green by the bedside and the landlady by the fire place. \" Oh, Amelia ! what, what has kept you so long ?\" said Susan \" I have been waiting nearly two hours to see you ; where have you been ?\" \" I've been to get food and medicine for Joey,\" putting, as she spoke, the articles on the mantle piece. \" When I found you out I waited ; and when he woke I went and got him some arrowroot andf fed him \u2014 .\" \"Thank you; but I did not think he would wake so soon. Is he asleep now ?\" \" Yes, without fear of being disturbed,\" said Mrs. Jackson, abruptly. Amelia stopped suddenly as she was crossing the room, to look at the boy. \" What do you mean 1\""], [193, "AUNT ELIZA'S GARRET. 169 \" Mean,\" continued Mrs. Jackson, \" why, I mean that the young'un died just half-an-hour ago in Susan's lap, and a 'appy release I should say.\" Amelia rushed to the bed side and there, true enough, lay the corpse of him, to save whose body she had placed her soul in jeopardy. After looking at him for some moments in silence, she muttered \u2014 \" Poor fellow, your mother's prayer is answered, and my promise has not been fulfilled. Oh ! why did I not act before ?\" Stooping down she kissed his cold lips, placed his frock over his face, and walked towar Is the door. \" Where are you going, Amelia?\" asked Susan, catching her by the arm. \" To perdition !\" With a sudden jerk she released herself from Susan's grasp, and then Jest the room. \" What's to be done?\" asked Susan. \" How wild she looked !\" \" How should I know what's to be done 1\" returned Mrs. Jackson. 41 Something ain't gone just right, and this job has made it wus. She's j, 'oman after all.\" \" You hinted at that once before,\" said Susan ; \" you were wrong then, and bo you are now ; she's too good for that.\" \" Ah !\" ejaculated Mrs. Jackson. 41 1 shall follow her; she ain't to be trusted as she is now.\" \" You had better leaFe her alone. \" \" I can do as I like, I suppose,\" returned Susan, sharply, and lest the room. She reached the street in time to see Amelia turn the corner. Susan ran as fast as she was able, and succeeded in getting another glimpse of Amelia as shehurried onwards. To Susanit seemed that Amelia was conscious of being followed. The pursuer and pur sued were not long in reaching King William Street. The night was dark and windy ; and the rain beat in their faces as they sped along. It was difficult for Susan, as s&e contended with the wind, to keep up her pace, aud to shout was useless, for the wind carried the sound backwards. When Susan saw Amelia turn down King William Street, a sudden thought passed through her brain which gave her fresh strength to continue iu the chase. With every step she shortened the distance between them. It was a race for life, and SuBan knew it. Still on they sped and the bridge was reached. For a moment Amelia stood as if to gain breath. Susan tried to shout but, breathless as she was, it was s. vain attempt. Amelia, as if she had gained strength by her slight cessation from running, mounted the step and was quickly on the parapet. Susan saw the action; with an impulsive spring she"], [194, "170 AUNT ELIZA'S GARRET. leaped forward ; at that instant Amelia sank into the darkness that floated between her and the rushing waters beneath. But luckily Susan had succeeded in catching hold of the skirt of Amelia's dress, aud with the quickness of electricity she reached forward her other hand and made her grasp more secure. For a moment thus she stood ; then with a shrill scream she called for help. \" Amelia, Amelia, put your knee on the ledge ! Help, help, murder ' Meely, Meely, for God's sake don't kick so ! Ob, God, help, help !\" Amelia by Susan's action was thus held dangling overthe parapet. Susan's scream had roused her from the paralyses under which, it may be said, her brain was suffering, and of making her conscious of the dangercus position she was in. For a moment Amelia struggled to save herself, but her back being towards the bridge, her efforts were worse than useless. Seeing this, she cried out \u2014 \" Oh, God, forgive me !\" closed her eyes, and fainted. Susan still screamed for help, and as she felt her arms beginning to fail, she cried out, in the agony of her soul, \" Ob, God, give me strength or she is lost !\" As this prayer, the prompting of a troubled soul, passed her lips, she saw a policeman and a gentleman running towards her from the city side, and another gentleman from the Southwark side. \" Help, help !\" she shouted again, '4 for God's love make haste !\" In a second the three sprang forward and caught hold of Amelia's dress, thinking to relieve Susan. \" Oh, God, her frock is tearing !\" exclaimed Susan, \" her frock is tearing ! Get her hand, do get her hand, there's dear, kind gentlemen.\" Without thinking of the danger, the gentleman who had come up from the Southwark side leaned over, aud with one hand seized her arm, and with his other held firmly to tbe bridge, then with Herculean strength pulled her up and held her so while the policeman, with the assistance of the other gentleman, put his belt round her waist, and then between them lifted her over on to the pavement. 44 Thank God, she's saved !\" shrieked Susan, and straightway sank into a death-like swoon. \"Stand aside, policeman,\" exclaimed one of the gentlemen. \"Good God ! throw your bull's eye here upon her face. It is my sister !*"], [195, "aunt eliza's garret. 171 CHAPTER XXVIII. When Susan and Amelia recovered their senses, they found themselves in the care of tbe police ; Susan was at liberty to depart, but Amelia was retained in custody for having attempted to destroy her life. George, who had so unexpectedly appeared on London Bridge, bad been persuaded by the police to retire ; as they thought, from the brief explanations he had given, that his sudden appearance might have an ill effect upon his sister. After being promised by the inspector that every proper attendance should be paid Amelia, he lest, desiring that Susan might be brought to where he was staying \u2014 a policeman had hastily been dispatched to procure lodgings for George for the night \u2014 so that he might learn the history of his aunt and sister. Susan was, therefore, surprised to find herself handed into a cab and taken by a policeman to a private boarding-house, where she was shown into a small parlour, in the stove of which a newly-lighted fire was burning silling the room with smoke. \" I'll now leave you,\" said the policeman ; \" you must not fail to be at the police court early in the morning. I've brought you here by the direction of a friend of the youug lady ; he'll be here directly, good night. The policeman left the room, and Susan sank into a chair aud wept. She was so overcome by what she had done, so surprised at what was taking place around her, that she could not collect her thoughts to ask a single question. George soon entered the room. Susan was still crying and did not notice him. He advanced to where she was sitting, and placing his hand upon her shoulder, said, in a low tone, \" Susan.\" Swallowing, as it were, a convulsive shriek, she rose from her seat and endeavoured to say, \" Sir,\" then sank back again and sobbed aloud. \"Susan,\" continued George, \"do you not know me? George, Meely's brother.\" \" What, George !\" exclaimed Susan, taking her hands from her face and looking at him for the first time, \" George ! good God, how altered, how grown ! This is a surprise. How happy your poor, poor sister will be to 6ee you. Oh, George, would to God you had stayed at home ! And when away it was cruel on your part never to let her hear from you. God knows how she has struggled on through the long, weary days of her most dreary life, without a smile to cheer her on her rough"], [196, "aunt eliza's garret. 172 and hilly way.\" [How eloquent affection had made this poor, unedu cated creature] Oh, George, why did you leave your ship, and not a line to that dear, loving sister, who, iu the lone hours of night, as she sat at her ill-paying work, has had her thoughts fixed on her absent brother, wondering whether he was with the living or the dead ? It was cruel, George, it was indeed.\" George stood in the centre of that little room a fine grown man ; but the tears were trickling down his pale cheek as he listened to Susan's upbraiding \u2014 his first greeting \u2014 who, as she spoke, sat with her eyes fixed on the floor, and her body swinging to and fro in the bitterness of her grief ; she loved Amelia with a sister's love. \" Susan,\" said George, as he saw she was about to continue, \" I have been in England some three hours, not more ; what I have done in my past life may have been wrong ; if so, my punishment has now com menced. If I deserve upbraiding, continue; but, in Leaven's name, let me know what has happened to my aunt, my sister, and little Joey, since I started from London Bridge until the present moment.\" \"There's much to tell,\" continued Susan, \"of bitter trials to that poor girl, your sister ; of hard work, and poor pay made poorer still by the loss of your monthly pittance.\" \" Do not hurry, Susan,\" said George, seeing that she could scarcely proceed in consequence of her tears, and at the same time taking a seat beside her, \" take your time ; I will listen patiently and attentivdy ; only let me know th? worst.\" Susan wiped away her tears, rested her elbow on her knees, and her head upon her hands ; gazing vacantly upon the fire with her body continually upon tbe swing, she began to tell the tale of Amelia's life. The words came slow at first, but as her subject worked upon her feelings, her language became eloquent and poetical. She related every circumstance with distinctness and feeling ; indeed an actor might have learned a lesson from her. When she spoke of Aunt Eliza's death, George rose from his seat and paced the room. ; and when she told him how little Joey lay dead, his tears were rivers and his Bighs like the plaintive moaning of the uncertain wind. Susan saw him not ; she told her tale of wo, unconscious of the wound she made ; she spoke of troubles she bad felt, and of temptations she had met ; she felt a pride in the consciousness that Amelia had braved them all, and a humbleness in the thought that she herself had fallen, hating with a deadly bate he who had perilled her futurity; loving, in the secret of her soul, the very being whose heart she was tearing asunder. Her words were words of bitterness for they came from her heart, which years of pent-up misery had rendered bitterest of the bitter. When"], [197, "AUNT ELIZA'S OARRET. 173 she had finished, George sat down once more beside her, and taking her hand in his, bade her listen. \" I need not tell you, Susan, with what an aching heart I left home. I was upheld in that act of mine by duty. When I reached India, an opportunity offering, I left my ship and went to Australia ; the fact that gold had been discovered reached me even there. I thought of those I had left behind ; and resolved, at all risks, to obtain some of the coveted metal. I was laughed at, but I felt that they were wanting if at home ; and though the laugh was against me, I determined to have my try. I went. Oh, Susan, you cannot tell how I slaved when I was at the diggings, to find that which has the power of pro- ducing either happiness or misery. For days and days I toiled ; and as day succeeded day, so was I unsuccessful in my search, while others close by me had gained ; that, as well as the hope that I should be able to return to England sufficiently rich to keep those my heart held most dear, from poverty, prompted me to continue. Gold, gold ! it was my God ! At night I prayed, oh, so earnestly, that I might find some on the morrow. I prayed that in my dreams I might be told where to search successfully ; but no, Susan, my dreams where of those I had lest at home. Sometimes I saw them with smiling faces ; at others gaunt and thin. Sometimes I dreamed that Amelia was a beggar in the streets ; at others that she was in some splendid mansion \u2014 a victim of the rich. I became ill, and for weeks unconscious of everything ; how I recovered is a mystery ; but I did get better, and I went to work again with a maddened energy. I saw one man find gold \u2014 a lump that in itself was a fortune, beyond the hope of avarice \u2014 and I still unsuccessful. I saw him watch that gold by night ; he seemed to worship it ; for a moment, Susan, I shudder now 1 think of it, I stood behind him with my hand upou a kind of dagger, we were alone, I raised my haud to strike ; but in that instant I saw my aunt stand before me with a reproachful look ! Whether it were the excited state of my mind that made me think I saw her, or whether there was something palpable to sight, I do not know. It might have been a flashing thought \u2014 the mental eye, diseased perhaps, seeing through the physical \u2014 a kind of delirium tremens. But that matters little, I only know it, stayed my hand. I went away and on my knees thanked God for having saved me this crime. Next day I was successful. Successful beyond my hopes ; I had found a fortune. I kept it secret, and worked on. Gold, more and more, came into my hands ! Gold, gold, oh, Susan, as the yellow metal came sometimes in very dust, sometimes in larger pieces, I thought I should have gone mad with delight, a delight I was afraid to give expression Then the"], [198, "174 AUNT ELIZA'S GARRET. thought \u2014 it seemed as if some one had whispered in my ear \u2014 could I not be content with what I had obtained, made me discontinue my search for more. Then came my anxiety to get away and to start for England. Oh, how I watched my gold ! I suspected every one. I prayed for my life, ami dreaded every hour that I should be robbed and murdered. Days seemed months and weeks, years. At last I embarked. You cannot tell how I dreaded the least puff of wind least it should become a gale ; nor how I anxiously watched each man\u0153uvre of the sailors to see that they were acting properly. At last we entered the channel, and then I gave myself up for lost ; my last night at sea will never be forgotten. They all believed me mad on board, and pitied me. They attributed my madness to non-success at the diggings; and little dreamed I had gold in my luggage that might presently be at the bottom ; for it was a dreadful night ! To-day we reached Gravesend ; this very afternoon I landed my gold, aud left it in safe custody of the Custom-house officer. I was afraid to leave it even there; but, at length, feeling convinced of its safety, I got into the mail train and came up to town, in time to help save Amelia. My God ! was it for this I toiled !\" \" God bless him !\" said Susan, between her sobs. \" Now you know my struggles ; but yet there is something else to be accounted for. You tell me that Amelia has wanted ; that her pittance was made still smaller by the stoppage of my half-pay ; but twice I wrote to her, telling where I was, and the last time I wrote, nine months since, I sent her the means of obtaining more than enough to keep them from want from that time to the present moment.\" \" It has never been received,\" said Susan. \"I suppose not; but that must be seen to,\" said George. He and Susan had something yet to learn, something to wound their hearts still more. CHAPTER XXIX. Is the morning Amelia was brought before the magistrate ; bur, George, still fearful that his sudden appearance would have an ill effect upon Amelia, stayed away, leaving the Inspector to have explained to his worship that a home of comfort was being hastily prepared for her reception."], [199, "AUNT ELIZA'S GARRET. 175 The first person that Amelia saw when she entered the court, was Susan, and for the moment as she noticed the hopeful smile, blending of joy and sorrow upon her countenance, she regretted that she had not succeeded in her suicidal act. The facts of the case were gone into. Then was drawn from Amelia, word by word, a short history of her troubles, and, last of all, of her engagement to Sir William ; and the reason assigned for her criminal act was, the desire, now that the sole object of her life had passed away, to save herself from a life of sin. The magistrate, however, said \u2014 \" he was not to be humbugged in that manner. He had put his veto against suicide ; it had become a perfect nuisance, and like all nuisances he had determined to put it. down. It was nothing more than a trick ; he felt quite disgusted with such manoeuvres to excite the sympathy of the rich. He looked upon it as nothing more. Here was a girl \u2014 by her own showing ready to stick at nothing to obtain money \u2014 pretending to jump over London bridge ; but it appears she took care to have one of her companions near her, and who had sufficient hold of her dress to keep her in what, to superficial observers, appeared a most awful and thrilling position.\" How long the worthy magistrate \u2014 this would-be Sir Oracle \u2014 would have continued in this strain had not the clerk addressed him in au under tone, it is impossible to say. For some minutes the two seemed to be engaged in seriou3 conversation ; at length, the magistrate con tinued :\u2014 \" But as there appears to be something extraordinary about this affair, 1 shall remand the case to give time for inquiries.\" The next day the case was reported at length in tbe papers. Many read it. Some approved of the remarks made by the magistrate, some condemn them ; others put their hands into their pockets for the purpose of forwarding a donation to the magistrate for Amelia, but stopped half way, the question \u2014 \" was it not supporting wicked actions in young girls?\" flitted across the brain, and the answer being in the affirmative, they turned to some other part of the paper and soon became interested in another topic. Yet there were a few who enter tained other ideas ; who thought that, bad as Amelia might be, her case called for the exercise of charity. On the next day tbe magistrate announced publicly that he had received certain donations to be applied in relieving Amelia. These donations were, however, ultimately declined, but thankfully acknowledged by George, who left the amount in the magistrate's hand to be applied as he might think best. Amelia was not detained long in custody. At the end of the second day she was allowed to depart, in the care of Susan Green, who"], [200, "176 AUNT ELIZA'S GARRET. orthwith assisted her into a cab which she had kept in waiting for the rpurpose. For some time they sat in silence ; at length, Amelia asked : \u2014 '\u2022 Where are we going ?\" \" Home,\" said Susan. \"Home!\" exclaimed Amelia, turning round and looking Susan in the face. \" Home ! and is it possible, Susan, that you are the first to take me to a home of shame ?\" \" God forbid !\" returned Susan. Their eyes then met and for the first time Susan noticed the va3t change that had come over Amelia, and insensibly a chilly fear took possession of her mind. \" What does all this mean, then ?\" asked Amelia ; \" we are getting near the outskirts.\" \" We are so much nearer home \u2014 a home, Meely, that shall be a happy one to you. Now do not smile like that ; as if you didn't believe it, nor didn't wish to believe it.\" \" Aud can you wonder at my want of faith ?\" said Amelia. \" There seems to me to he only one way of my living, and that is but death a little longer deferred. I have two choices, one, splendid misery ! sinking to a mere machine to pamper to a rich man's sensuality ; the other, misery without its gilding.\" \"Come, come, Meely, don't talk so, try and cheer up. See how bright tbe sun is shining; and look, oh, look, there are some green fields ! Oh, how delightful to be able to live all the summer in the country. Let's have the window open ; bow sweet the air is ; it makes me feel as if I could jump out of myself. There, I'm sure you've much to be thankful for, Meely, and such a nice home as I'm told you're going to.\" \"And who told you about it ?\" \" Why, the dear, kind heart that got it, and is waiting anxiously to welcome you to it.\" \" What do you mean, Susan ? I cannot think that you would wish to torture me by reference to that brute, Sir William, to whom I must submit. Oh! wbydidyou not let me die ? I should have been saved from his contamination.'' 44 Medy, there's not a soul in God's creation that love's you more than I do; not even your brother, and I know his love is great indeed; and I would rather bite out my tongue than that it should speak one word upon a subject that both of us would gladly forget.\" 41 Then what does all this mean ?\" \" That yon have friends.\" \" I know of none.\""], [201, "AUNT ELIZA'S GARRET, 177 \"Relations.\" \" Dead.\" \" Not all, Meely.' \" Except my brother, and he may be dead, too, for ought I know ; and if so, perhaps it is as well that he is.\" \" And so then, Meely, you would not care to see your brother ?\" said Susan, with a degree of naivete in her expression. \" If I could see him happy, and to die directly.\" \" Now don't harp on dying,\" exclaimed Susan, with a shudder. \" But suppose your brother was to return to England a rich man.\" 41 We might as well suppose a workwoman becoming rich by her needle, as to suppose a sailor to become rich by his calling\" returned Amelia. \" Well, but many strange things have come about.\" \"What iu heaven's name do you mean, Susan?\" asked Amelia, somewhat irritably. \" If you have anything serious, tell me, I can bear it.\" \" I havn't anything serious to tell.\" \" Nor very joyful ; mine's not a joyful life.\" 44 Well, then, if you promise not to excite yourself \" I'll promise anything, only if you have anything to tell me, do so, and let there be an end of it.\" Susan then by degrees disclosed to her how she had been saved from the river, and how that he who had so opportunely come to her rescue was no other than her brother, and how that he had returned rich from the gold diggings, and had taken a furnished house a little way out of town, where she was to live as long as she liked ; and how little Joey had been respectably buried, and how \u2014 . \"God bless my soul!\" exclaimed Susan, turning round, \"what a brute I am! here have I been so fearful of breaking the news to her lest it should make her worse, and now, forgetting al! my good in tentions and promises, have I been rattling on as fast as the wheels, and the poor girl in a fainting fit all the time.\" Upon Amelia recovering her senses she was resting in the arms of her brother and Susan bathing her temples. Amelia, however, was too much affected to speak. She merely opened her eyes, tried to smile at her brother, drew her arm, if possible, tighter round his neck, and then sauk into a lethargic state from which, for weeks, she was never thoroughly arouBed. In the meanwhile George had not been idle. He had determined, if possible, to discover what had become of the remittances he had forwarded home. At first he met considerable difficulty ; but know"], [202, "ACNT ELIZAS GARRET. 178 what had become of them he would, and he persevered accordingly. He succeeded, at length, in tracing the ship's letter bags from the ship to the post-office, from thence to London, and in consequence of the admirable management of the post-office, he discovered who the postman was who had letters to deliver in that district during a certain period. This man swore that all letters delivered into his charge had been properly delivered at their addresses or returned to the post-office . There could be no doubt but that the letters had reached their desti nation, as the money had been received by some one. George followed up the affair with a determination of wreaking some degree of vengeance upon the head of the offending party. The theft must lie between the postman and parties in the house. George, however, did not for a moment suspect the postman; his suspicions were fixed elsewhere ; and he acted upon those suspicions with secrecy, promptness, and deter mination. Before many days were passed our old acquaintance, Mrs. Jackson, (Amelia's landlady), was duly committed to take her trial at the central criminal court, for stealing letters aud bills ; passing herself off as Aunt Eliza, and receiving and keeping for har own use money that would have kept both Aunt Eliza and Joey from the grave. Fear loosened Mrs. Jackson's tongue, and what proof was wanting she unconsciously supplied herself. She was tried and sentenced to be transported. It was some satisfaction to George to know that one of Amelia's enemies had been punished. With Sir William he took a very different plan. Day after day George called upon him, but was not allowed to see him. Nothing was left George but to wait for him in the street. One day seeing him about to alight from his horse, George hastened up and demanded if he were not Sir William. Upon being answered in the affirmative, George immediately made himself known and, grasping the collar of Sir William's coat, then and there inflicted upon the libertine a most severe horsewhipping with a short, heavy, gutta percha whip he had bought for the purpose, and then left him lying in the gutter. It had been done so quickly that the groom could not leave the high-spirited horses, who began to plunge about upon seeing the hostile attitude of George, nor could he ring the bell for the porter and the rest of the men-servants. So George had it comfortably to himself, and he certainly made the most of his time."], [203, "AUNT ELIZA'S GARRET. 179 CHAPTER XXX. It was a few days after that on which the last related event occurred that George, as he was sauntering along the Strand rather early in the evening, waiting for an omnibus to overtake him and carry him home was struck by the appearauce of a poorly clad woman who, for the moment, he thought lie knew bat could not remember her name Their eyes met, and then they both stood still. \" Pardon me,\" said George, \" but have we not met before ?\" \" Possibly,\" returned (be woman. \" My name is Pratt, George Pratt, do -j-.' \" Oh, to be sure, I remember. And how are you ? Have you been long home ?\" \" Not many weeks,\" returned George. \" But as you recollect my name, will you let me _hear yours ? for the life of me I cannot call it to mind.\" \"Johnson.\" \"Dear me, yes; aud what are you doing? not quite so flourishing, eh ?\" \" I have had a run of ill-luck lately, I think,\" returned Miss Johnson. \" I am truly sorry to hear it,\" was George's reply. \" In fact, ever since that unfortunate affair ; but I suppose you have not heard about it. It's rather a long story, and perhaps you are in a hurry.\" \"At any rate 1 should like to hear all about my old friends,\" returned George, \" and if you like to step in here and take a cup of tea with me \u2014 \" \" I shall be most happy,\" returned Miss Johnson. George then led her into a cotfee-liouse near the Strand Theatre, and took her upstairs into a room that, fortunately, was unoccupied. George then thinking, from the paleness of his companion's cheek and the poverty of her dress that, in all probability, she had not known what a good meal was for some time past, ordered a good, substantial, meal to be placed before them. That meal dispatched, George said: \u2014 \" Now then, Miss Johnson, if you please, I am all attention and anxious to hear you relate your troubles and, if possible, 1 am ready to relieve them ; for both my sisterand Susan Green tell me you did many little acts of kindness to my poor aunt.\""], [204, "180 AUNT ELIZA'S GARRET. \" Law bless you !\" returned Miss Johnson, \" what I did was not much, nothing but what one woman ought to do for another. But you have not said anything about your sister ; is she well ?\" \" Not very,\" returned Geerge, who, in few words, told her that bis sister had been so severely tried since her aunt's death that she became tired of her life, and had fortunately been saved from suicide by Susan Green. \" But now proceed, my time is short.\" \" Soon after your aunt's death I left lodging at Mrs. Jackson\". \u2014 . \"By the way, though, begging pardon for interrupting you, are you aware that that woman is transported ?\" \" Transported !\" exclaimed Miss Johnson. \" Yes, transported,\" repeated George. - No.\" \" It's a fact, though.\" \" Why, how was that ?\" asked Mis6 Johnson, forgetting in her snrprise her own troubles. \" Simply thus,\" continued George. \" When I was in Australia I remitted my aunt some money ; this money Mrs. Jackson succeeded in obtaining and keeping for her own use, whilst my poor aunt and sister were starving. I traced it home to her \u2014 that is, my solicitor did proved all the facts, and the judge transported her.\" \"Good God ! you do surprise me.\" \" Al), there's many a curious thing occurs in this world, isn't there?\" said George. \" But now, then, let us see if we can proceed once more.\" 41 Well, soon after your aunt's death I left lodging at Mrs. Jackson's, in consequence of having been engaged to take the management of a miliuery and baby-linen business, at the east end. It was a very tidy business, and the reason why the party to whom it belonged wanted some one to manage it was, he had ju_t lost his wife, who had spent nearly the whole of her time in the business. I was to sleep in the house, and to take everything under my care. This I thought was too good a situation to be foolishly lost, so I turned my attention to the business with a great deal more anxiety than had it been my own. In fact, I became a perfect slave; for the first time in my life, I believe. He found that things were going on prosperously ; indeed, every one, even he himself, admitted that it had greatly improved since it had been under my management ; for though his wife was very persevering, -he did not possess the same amount of taste. I, at length, took a pride in the affair myself ; and what I had done before, because it was my duty, I did then for the love of the thing. Weeks passed and the proprietor took less and less interest in the business ; and, at length, it became quite a matter of difficulty for me to get him to go"], [205, "AUNT ELIZA'S GARRET. 181 through my weekly accounts, and sometimes he would let matters stand over for a month or more before he would go into them. At length he began to teaze me with an undue familiarity. I will not pretend \u2014 because I know I should not be believed \u2014 to a very great amount of modesty, but I knew sufficiently that, to continue my authority in that house, I must make myself respected by the proprietor. I shall, therefore, be more readily believed if I say, that interest made me treat with coldness his familiar approaches, and after he had tried once or twice to thrust himself into my room unsuccessfully, the matter, as I thought, dropped, and things went on smoother, if possible, than before. I congratulated myself upon my firmness, and calculated that I had secured a comfortable and constant situation. But I was mistaken. A short time afterwards my employer brought home a friend to sup with him; they entered through the shop; that friend was Sublimus Quizby.\" \" The devil,\" muttered George. \" He recognized me, of course, and spoke. I answered as coolly as I could, and the two passed on. I do not know \u2014 but I did and do suspect \u2014 that this Quizby had something to say that did not add very much to my good character, for I was once more treated rudely by my employer. I am telling you the truth, and I don't mind making you my confidant, for I know you of old. At one time he said, ' why the devil do you refuse me? I am, I fancy, a d \u2014 n deal better thau Quizby, out of whom you succeeded in drawing a little sum.' I was so vexed for the moment that I could not answer him, and he con tinued, ' there, you see, I know a little more of your fine goings on than you are aware of.' ' You seem,' I replied, ' to have been mighty inquisitive, and, I think, the best thing for both of us is, for you to get another forewoman, who will do anything you require.' 'Oh, very well,' said he ; ' am I to take that for a regular notice ?' ' Cer tainly,' I said, and left the room. At the proper time I handed my books to him for inspection, and soon after left. \"As I was sitting in my new lodgings \u2014 where I had hastily removed, and, I must say, rather vexed with myself for having been so remark ably short in my conduct \u2014 thinking I might have managed the little fool better than I had, when someone asked to see me. It was the man who had employed me, with a policeman.\" ' We want to search your boxes, Johnson,' he said, as sharply as possible. \u25a0 What for ?' said I, in surprise. ' What for! why for things that are missing from home,' said he. ' If you think I have stolen any of your goods, you're at perfect liberty to search my boxes,' said I. 12"], [206, "182 AUST eliza's GARRET. \" They did search, and Bure enough nicely rolled up was a bundle of baby-linen, and in tbe centre of this linen were half-a-dozen silver spoons. Indeed. George, I'm telling you the truth when I say that I was completely taken by surprise when they were produced. I could scarcely speak ; aud when I denied that I had put them there, the policeman merely smiled ; the other turned sharply round and asked in a savage manner, that I should never have thought him capable of, ' wbo the devil did t \" Well, I was taken to the police-station; the magistrate committed me for trial ; I was found guilty ; sentenced to three months imprison ment ; and 1 declare to my God, if it were the last moment I had to live, that I was innocent of stealing those ai tides.\" \" And what have you been doing since ?\" asked George. \" I have not long been at liberty. Let me go where I would for work, every one seemed to recognize me as one who bad been convicted ; and I wandered about lor some time to get work, but all seemed to be afraid to trust the work in my bauds, or to have me in the house. At length I did succeed in getting some in the house, where they pay unheard-of low wages, aud they are glad to get anyone who can do it, to do it, and there I ain still.\" \" If you did not put those articles in your box, have you no idea who did ?\" asked George. \"I thought, at first, it was his doings, but since I have been out I have made inquiries, and I find that one of the girls who was always a great deal of trouble to me, is now the forewoman\u2014 and a nice picture op is!\" continued Miss Johnson, with contempt. \" This girl seemed to entertain some 3pite against me \u2014 why, I do not know \u2014 and was always trying to make mischief between the master and myself. She is now mistress there in all repects, and it is her I suspect.\" \" Where are you living now?\" demanded George. \" I share a room with another in a court near Drnry Lane, at present.\" \" Look here,\" continued George, after some moments reflection, \" I tell you frankly what are my thoughts. I am willing to believe that in this affair of stealing you are innocent ; but you must admit that some acts of yours have not borne the stamp of rectitude. You see how soon a handle can be made to which one may affix a dishonest motive ; aud, depend on it, Quizby was not the one not to improve upon the excellent opportunity you had given him ; but God knows how soon the firmest of us may fall, and I onght not to be the first to cast the stone. I have been fortunate, Miss Johnson, and I thank God for it. Now, I suppose, you have no particular idea of doing anything beyond what you are now doing.\" Miss John.on shook her head."], [207, "AUNT ELIZA'S GARRET. 183 \" Except, perhaps,\" continued George, \" to get a better frock and to trick another Quizby.\" Miss Johnson coloured slighty and bung her head ; then trying to smile at George's joke, said, or rather sighed', \" ah, you men.\" \"Well, well, you mustn't mind me, a successful man\" \u2014 and a smile something like that of old rested upon his countenance\u2014\" has a right to joke, you know. What do you say to go into business on my account ; that is, to become my forewoman ?\" \" Ah,\" sighed Miss Johnson, \" I am not so well able to take a joke now as I was nine months ago.\" \" Nonsense, I am not joking. You have had some little trouble, and I am sorry for it ; but what pleases me is, you lent a helping hand occasionally to my aunt and sister, will you accept tho same from me ?\" \" My circumstances are such that I should be glad to receive a helping hand from any one. I should be doubly thankful to receive it from you.\" \"Well, then, we will consider the matter settled. Come down to morrow to where we are at present staying, and we'll talk the matter over. In the mean time, you must let me give yon something that will pay your omnibus hire.\" He then slipped into her hand half-a sovereign, and soon after they parted. In a few weeks time Miss Johnson was installed as mistress, on behalf of George, in a comfortable business ; she used her best endea vours in turning it to advantage, and which ultimately George handed over to her entirely, merely receiving from her the rent of the premises. Some months after Miss Johnson had become the owner of this business, an apparent stranger applied to her for work; in this person she discovered the one she had suspected of putting the forks into her box. The history of this girl was short. She had been successful for some time, and carried all before her ; but, ultimately, she became a mother, and just before that circumstance happened, she was turned out of the house at almost an hour's notice. She had not received any assistance from the father of her child, and had become exceedingly reduced. Thinking, perhaps, that she might make a friend of Miss Johnson, she freely confessed that she had put the articles in tho box, but'that she had done so at the instigation of the man who had seduced her, and afterwards turned her out of his house. Miss Johnson, remembering the kindness which she had received from George, did not forget to treat with some degree of kindness this unfortunate girl. By the aid of George's solicitor, Miss Johnsou obtained \u2014 by threatening to expose and punish his conduct towai us herself\u2014 an income for the child, whilst she herself employed tin"], [208, "184 AUUT ELIZA'S GARRET. mother. In this latter transaction she was once more thrown in contact with Sublimus Quizby, who acted as the friend of the tradesman. He had become a widower, and had now some very serious thoughts of really taking another wife, but as we shall have much to relate of this gentleman in another tale, we will for the present dismiss him. CHAPTER_XXXI. There are so many changes going on the world, and that, too, so rapidly, that one can scarcely note them down. George, who never forgot an old friend, had been to see Mr. Godfrey, (who had left the firm of Hickory, Thompson, and Hichory, and had become the managing clerk of another establishment,) and was returning along Newgate Street; as he passed he determined to call in at Mrs. Jennings's. Here he found a great change. Both Mr. and Mrs. Jennings had, in the few years they had been in business, succeeded rapidly. Being of a grasping disposition, Mrs. Jennings gradually began to lose sight of the fact that she had been once a common needle-girl ; therefore, she forgot the many privations that those poor creatures daily suffer, and became, if possible, one of the worst mistresses in London. Her sole business-idea was, how to get the greatest amount of work done for the least amount of money. Formerly her object was merely to get enough work for herself and her hands, with a fair profit to herself. But money came in, and like alcoholic drinks, the more one takes the more thirsty one becomes ; so with money, the more Mrs. Jennings took the more she desired. She made her hands work early and late; but she paid them less and less. Her heart got more hardened, and her mind depraved. It was, therefore, no wonder when George called that he was surprised at the change he found in the once merry, laughing woman, who, when he had called before in the capacity of errand boy from his aunt and sister, found her dressed in a neat alpaca dress; but who now found her, beyond doubt a fine woman, dressed in the most fashionable style ; the articles, wherewith her attire had been made, being the very best that the market could supply. To say that she was dressed with taste would not be correct ; indeed that would be implying that fashion shows taste, which, in too many"], [209, "A.wr eliza's GAR-RET. 185 cases, it does not ; the costermonger's idea of pride and of superiority could be traced in this successful woman ; and the vulgarly-affected manner she entered the room in which George had been shown, sur prised and disgusted him. Mrs. Jennings bent towards George in what she believed to be the most graceful of curtsies ; indeed, if lessons could give grace, she bad received enough of them from the master of a dancing academy hard by, where balls took place three times a-week, but, with all his trouble, he could not convert the sudden bend into an easy aud graceful curtsy. Mrs. Jenuings smiled, but what a different expression it, gave her somewhat naturally pleasing countenance. George could recollect that at one time when she smiled her whole face beamed with delight, but now it was merely a muscular motion of the lip, and meant nothing. Well, she smiled and bade George be seated. She did not recognize him. \" And tcAo, sir, am I indebted to for this visit ?\" she asked. \"Really,\" Mrs. Jennings, \"am 1 so altered as all that!\" exclaimed George, in surprise. \" If, indeed, I have altered so much in appearance as yourself, madam, since I last saw you, there can be no wonder in your surprise. You are vastly \u25a0 \u2014 .\" \"It seems, then, that we are old acquaintances,\" returned Mis. Jennings, checking a .mile that was beginning to play naturally upon her face at George's flattery ; for old acquaintances were to be forgotten on her part as soon as possible. \" Do you not recollect a Mrs. Pratt, that onee worked for you ?\" asked George. \" Mrs. Pratt, oh, yes. But surely you are not her nephew who went to sea !\" returned Mrs. Jennings. \" Indeed I am.\" \" You surprise me ! What a difference between the boy who brought bonnets home and the full-grown sailor. Well, and what's j our si6ter doing ?\" \" Nothing,\" returned George, \"she is too ill to work, and if she were able I am, thank God, sufficiently provided for to keep her without her having recourse to her needle.\" \"Indeed!\" exclaimed Mrs. Jennings, throwing off (directly she heard that George was, at least, well provided for,) the formal manner she had assumed vpoa his entry, and once more became !ier natural self; so drawing her chair close to him, and placing her hands upon her knees, begged to know what he had been doing. In few words George related his adventures at the diggings, leaving out the facts that concerned his friends at home. It was sufficient sot"], [210, "186 AUNT ELIZA'S GARRET. Mrs. Jennings to know that he was rich, and a young man ; another change flitted across her face, for a moment it bore the stamp of thought. and then again came the old smile that had formerly made her so liked amongst the girls she had employed. \"Well,\" she continued, \"I am certainly pleased to hear that you have been successful at the diggings. You have made more money than we have, I dare say, with all our hard work ; but there, some have the luck of it.\" \" Aud those who do have the luck ought to be thankful for it,\" returned George, pointedly. \" Of course they ought,\" continued Mrs. Jennings, in atone of envy, \" but, lord bless you, we might have been a deal better off than we are, if Mr. Jennings had had any spirit about him. The opportunities that have offered of a west-end business, and he has refused, is quite surprising ; but, no, he has fixed himself here ; the business, he says, brings enough in to satisfy him, and he won't move where he might get more.\" \" Perhaps he shows sense in doing so,\" said George \" Well, I suppose he thinks so ; but, there, I hav'n't much time now, will you come and dine with us on Sunday next? there will be only Mr. Jennings and myself ; and bring your sister, it will cheer her up, perhaps, and do her good.\" After some little persuasion, and finding that they had taken a little cottage near Turnham Green, which was not very far from where George was living, he agreed, if his sister were well enough, to accept the invitation. He left soon afterwards. On his return home, Susan Green, who George had retained to nurse his sister, informed him that a gentleman had been waiting nearly four hours to see him. \"What ou earth could have induced him to wait all that time! What's his name ?\" \" He won't give any ; he merely says that it is very important that he sees you as soon as possible.\" \" Oh, very well ; I'll just step upstairs to Meeley, and then I'll see this very patient gentleman,\" returned George. After having visited his \u00abister in her room, he entered the one in which the gentleman was waiting. \" Am I addressing Mr. George Pratt ?\" said a little, thin, shabby genteel-looking man. \"That is my name,\" said George. \" Thank you, sir,\" continued he. \" I have sir, a somewhat unpleasant"], [211, "AUNT ELIZA'S GARRET. 187 duty to perform. I am a clerk in the office of Messrs. Kite, Dawes, and Kite, of Sergeant's Inn, Fleet Stieet, and in that capacity I have called on you to serve you with a copy of a writ.\" \" A w-hat !\" exclaimed George. \" Copy of a writ, sir. That is it,\" (handing George a narrow slip of paper,\") and this, sir, is the original, if you would like to inspect it.\" \" Well, I really don't know what this slip of paper means \u2014 \" \" I dessay not. It isn't to be expected that you should ; but if you'll permit me, I'll explain. You see, sir, I believe you and Sir William had a trifling quarrel \u2014 .\" \"Trifling quarrel do you call it!\" exclaimed George, his blood beginning to rise. \"Well, well, sir, we won't go into that matter.Jwe'll say a quarrel ; and you struck him with some instrument ; I need not hero enter into particulars \u2014 .\" \" Oh, it was a whip,\" said George, \" there can be no mistake about that ; an out-and-out good one, too ; I bought it for the purpose. It was one of these new gutta percha ones. Ah, here it is !\" George went to the corner of the room and came back with it in his hand. \" There, that's the instrument.\" \"Dear me,\" said the clerk, \" it's very heavy! Well, you see, sir, Sir William, hasn't been able to leave his bed yet \u2014 .\" \" I am very glad to hear it.\" 41 And he therefore, means to go to law upon the matter. He intends to lay the damages very high. And now, sir, I'll say good day.\" \" Have you had any refreshment while you have been waiting ? No ! You will, of course, take some.\" \" Really, sir, you are very kind ! It is seldom we meet a gentleman who takes the service of a writ so good humouredly ; and, if yon will excuse my remark, I certainly will take a little for the novelty of the thing.\" Refreshment was placed before him and, after making a hearty meal, the very polite representative of Messrs. Kite, Dawes, and Kite, lest and returned to town, mightily pleased with himself and George. The copy of the writ was handed over to the solicitor who had con ducted the prosecution of Mrs. Jackson, who forthwith entered an appearance on behalf of George. Sunday had arrived and George was preparing to go and dine at the Jennings's. Amelia was still too ill to leave her room, therefore George must, if he went at all, go alone. At first, he did not feel desirous of leaving his sister, but, ultimately, a strong, unaccountable impulse seemed to drive him there against his inclination. We need not analyze"], [212, "188 AUNT ELIZA'S 8AICBKT. his feelings : it is sufficient for our purpose to know that ho did go ; but if he had formed any idea of enjoying the hospitality of Mr. aud Mrs. Jennings, he was doomed to disappointment. When he arrived at Delaine Cottage he was surprised to see that it bore more the marks of mourning than that of rejoicing. He knocked and rung, as a large, vulgar, brass plate instructed him to do : he was then shown into a small parlour, very showily furnished. 44 Are you the gentleman, sir, master expected to dinner ?\" aBkcd the little girl, who tried by her dress to give herself the appearance of a full-grown woman. \" I am.\" \" Oh, then, sir, will you step into the garden to him ? You'll stud him out there feeding the poultry.\" George did as he was desired ; but instead of his finding Mr. Jennings engaged in fattening chochin China fowls, he found him walking up and down the small piece of ground \u2014 by courtesy called a garden \u2014 in an apparent disturbed state of mind, with about a dozen of the domestic feathered tribe at his heels. \"Ah, Mr. Pratt,\" exclaimed Jennings, directly he Baw George, how are you ? glad to see you ! I was afraid you wouldn't come. Brought your sister \u2014 too ill, eh ! Sorry to hear it, my boy very sorry.\" \"And how is Mrs. Jennings? Is she at home ?\" said Geeorge \" D \u2014 n Mrs. Jennings, 8ir, and she's not at home ! at least, she's not here, for this is no longer her home. Do you understand me, sir ?\" said Jennings, in an outburst of passion. \"I certainly do not!\" exclaimed George in surprise. \"No, how should you? Well, then, sir, in plain terms I have got no wife !\" As Jennings spoke he turned his head and put his hand kerchief to his face. \"There, don't talk, but come and sit down here, in this summer house, and I'll tell you all about it. I want some one to tell my troubles to, who is likely to listen to them like a friend.\" George sat down, his surprise increasing every moment. 41 Well now, listen,\" continued Jennings. \" We have been for some years past, in fact, ever since I took that shop in Newgate Street, getting on very fairly, very fairly, indeed. Mrs. Jennings attending to business at home, and I doing the travelling part ; but, confound the thing, the more money we made the more discontented she got and proud into the bargain. Well, she wanted me to take a west-end business, but I didn't feel inclined to do that, but kept to my old styl os business; that got larger, and I was kept longer from home on my journeys. Every time I did come home, Mrs. Jennings, I found, had made some new, stylish alteration in the place, and in her dress. This, of course, I did not object to, because I know there's a great deal in"], [213, "AUNT ELIZAS GARRET. 189 appearance ; but, d \u2014 me, her manner seemed tome altogether changed Well, to make a long story to me, short to you. I came to town on Tuesday ; on Wednesday, while I was in the shop, the postman put a letter on the desk. I saw the name Jennings, and I broke it open. I didn't stop to see if it were addressed to me or to Mrs. Jennings. I read it ; and what do you think it was ? \u2014 a letter signed L \u2014 t, making au appointment for Mrs. Jennings to meet L \u2014 t in Long Acre, for the purpose of spending the evening with some friends. Here was the explanation of the change in Mrs. Jennings, as you shall see. I folded the letter up again, put it in a fresh envelope, got a waiter at a coffee house to re-direct it, put it in the post again, and then I finished packing up some goods, said good-by to Mrs. Jennings, and started on my journey. I only started. At the right time I went to the meeting place in Long Acre. I hadn't been there long, when up came a cab, and Mrs. Jennings was handed out by a gentleman. 1 followed them to the theatre, from thence to street in the Strand. The house they entered was let out in chambers. I followed them to the very door ; I sat myself down on the stairs, wondering what I should do. I cannot tell you how I felt. I went into the street again and walked up and down several times crying \u2014 yes, sir, crying with the pain I felt round my heart \u2014 for I loved that woman, and I worked hard, sir, that she might enjoy my money. Why I did not rush in, I don't know, unless it was the impression that this was not her first visit. Well, sir, I at length returned to the door. I could hear my wife's laugh \u2014 it was long since I had heard her laugh at home \u2014 I seized the knocker and rapped. No answer. I rapped again, and again ; at length the door was opened. I pushed past the person who opened it, and rushed into the room. There, on a sofa drawn before the fire \u2014 with a table evidently pushed on one side \u2014 on which were the remnants of a supper and some decanters, sat Mrs. Jennings, with bonnet and shawl thrown off, aud \u2014 God forgive her !\" \" I understand,\" said George, mournfully ; \" and the name of her \u2014 .' \"Lord Littlewit, the friend of Sir William , who some chap gave a horsewhipping the other day; you've seen it in the papers, I suppose.\" \" I have not seen it in the papers, but I know who did it.\" George then in his turn made Jennings a confidant, so the two consoled themselves, and after dinner smoked their pipes in mournful silence. Jennings put the matter into the hands of George's solicitor. After some weeks of anxiety, the two actions were tried. Sir William had laid the damages at two thousand pounds; the jury returned a verdict, damages, one farthing. Jennings obtained damages at seven hundred pounds, with which we understand he intends applying for a divorce."], [214, "190 AUNT ELIZA'S GARRET. He has since, however, sold his business and Delaine cottage ; put his son to school, and has gone no one knows whither, a rich man, but a downcast, broken-hearted man, nevertheless. Not so, Mrs. Jennings ; she obtained her wish \u2014 a west -end business ! We have no room to carry her history further. Those who promenade the west -end streets, may see her name over her window ; and if they please, they may see in the window some animated dolls, fashionably dressed, hard at work. Watch that shop, and you will learn the future history of Mrs. Jennings. CHAPTER XXXII. With all George's care and affection; with all Susan's cheering voice and manner \u2014 though, poor girl, there was in her heart a secret source of unhappiness and reproach to herself \u2014 Amelia never tho roughly recovered from the shock her system had received. George had almost periled his soul for gold, but yet that gold, now it was obtained, would not bring back to his sister health aud happiness. Change of scene was recommended and adopted. From place to place George conveyed her, in the hope of finding health ; but if for a short time a smile lit up Amelia's face, or her cheek became tinted, giving some promise of restoration to its pristine beauty, it died away again, leaving the face still more sorrowful in expression, still more thin and emaciated. Alas ! Consumption, the destroyer of hundreds, had claimed Amelia as his own. Day succeeded day and she grew weaker ; yet it was but the other day she could walk out upon the sands by the sea-side, now she cannot move without help, even across her room. Susan is still her companion, still watches her with more than a sister's care, for Amelia will have none other. Still she sinks. It is a summer eve, and they are some miles inland \u2014 a pretty place, where Flora has bestowed her choicest favors. The birds are pouring forth their merry song, and the sweet scent of new mown hay is wafted through the air ; and the sky is one vast expanse of blue, with the lark high up, and yet ascending higher, pouring forth its liquid notes. All nature speaks of health and happiness. Here Amelia lies upon a couch, drawn to the window, inhaling the sweet perfume. For a moment this wreck of humanity, this diseased frame, so out of harmony with the surrounding scene, revives. She turns her gaze upon her brother, and sees tears standing in the corner of his eyes. She places her lips upon his, and bids him not to fret. The lark's"], [215, "AUNT ELIZA'S CARRET. 191 notes grow wilder, and seem to speak of life, hope and thankfulness. Amelia listens attentively. \" It's song grows painful to me, George.\" \" We'll close the window.\" . \" No, I like to hear it, notwithstanding; it but reminds me how much weaker I am to-day than I was yesterday.\" Then after a pause, she continued : \u2014 \" George, I shall soon go from you ; I know you say, that while there is life there is hope. But, dear George, I have long since ceased to hope for this world. And, indeed, why should I? Have I not hoped and been deceived, then hoped again and been deceived again ? So has my life passed away ! Were I, George, to recover, it would be the same hoping ever again. Thank heaven I have had time to prepare for the great change, and can calmly wait the stroke of death. But before I go, there's Susan ! what will become of her.' To me she has been a sister and a friend.\" \" She shall not want, Amelia.\" \" You have said it, George, and I am content. But I owe her something. I have watched her closely ; she loves you, George. Nay, do not let what I say bring more sorrow to your heart, nor while all else is sunshine add a cloud upon your brow. That's right, you smile again, a poor attempt at gaiety at best, but I must be content. She loves you, George, and though her whole life may not be without a blemish \u2014 andwhose is? \u2014 remember, dear, that the fallen, yet repentant woman, was not rejected by our blessed Saviour ; and if, my dear, you have no other attachment, aud should feel inclined to wed \u2014 and when I'm gone you will be lonely, very loiidy, perhaps \u2014 who so able to cheer you, and to make the hours of sorrow less sorrowful, as that kind soul who saved me from a wicked death, and gave me time to seek my God ? Her love alone would prompt her to do so; give her then the right. Remember, I do not ask it of you, George, for I have felt the awful effects of a hasty vow made to the dying to be desirous that you should bind yourself ; but I know the secret of her heart, and though she would rather die than disclose it, I do her but an act of justice in opening your eyes to the state of her feelings ; aud if you are not bound \u2014 .\" George brought his sister's cheek nearer to his lips and said, with great emotion, \" It shall be so, Amelia.\" \" Do not promise hastily, nor wed without love ; and above every thing, do not forget your God, who, in your days of poverty did not forget you. God bless you.\" Amelia, tired and exhausted with so much exertion, then rested her"], [216, "192 aunt eliza's garret. head upon her brother's 6houlder and, with her lips moving silently in prayer, sank into an apparent sleep. Then the song of the wild bird, sounded cheerfully in that shady, silent room, and tbe larks shrill voice seemed to have gained fresh strength, filling the air with liquid music: and the mowers, in the fields hard by, as they wiped theii scythe preparatory to sharpening, cast a hasty glance upwards at the songster who cheered them in their toil the whole day long. Then came the clashing sound of scythe and sharpening stone ; and George, as he listened, wondered when Death would mow the drooping flower beside him. An hour had passed and the light slumber had become a deep sleep. Susan now entered. With a step that searcely touched the floor of the apartment, she crossed the room, and seated herself on the couch at Amelia's feet and commenced working. Her needle now was plied with pleasure, for it was a household duty ! Another hour had passed aud Amelia had not moved. The only change that George was conscious of was, an increased weight upon his shoulder. At length the awful truth flashed across his mind. Her spirit, without a struggle, had left its earthly tenement, and had passed that dark and mystic veil which separates the known from the unknown worlds. Months passed and George and Susan became one. Their sorrows and their sin3 had been to them as a purifying furnace : they had taught the unstability of all things, and the necessity of faith in God. Blest with everything that money can procure, they have striven never to forget that they were once poor, and all their days are spent, without ostentation, in making all around them happy. Susan proves a virtuous wife, and George grows daily happier. If for a moment a murm uring voice rise in the breast of either, they seek together the ch urehyard, where a neat stone, with the simple inscription : \u2014 \" God grant us peace !\" \u2014 Amelia. points out the spot where rests the body of an English slave, and there they together strive to learn, w-ith God's help, to quell each sinful impulse, so that when death shall claim them as his own, they may have learned to \" DREAU the grave as little as their bee.\" \u2022Ef).
