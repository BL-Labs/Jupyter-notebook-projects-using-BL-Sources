The following pages are nearly a literal translation of a Comedy, in three Acts, by Monsieur Victor, entitled \" Hasard et Folie.\" The principal incident, which is a common one on the French stage, (occurring in \" Le duel et le baptSme,\" and several other vaudevilles, &c.) has been once before per sented to an English audience by Mr. Morton, in his excellent drama \" Henri Quatre : \" but in that drama the effects produced by it are of a serious complexion \u2014 in the following trifle they are (or, at least, were intended to be) comic. It is impossible, under some cir cumstances, conveniently to make a detail of this description in the bill issued by the Theatre, consequently, the translator, till his piece be published, is frequently accused of endeavouring to appropriate slily to himself the ideas of another person, while that per son is absolutely und\u00b0r equal obligations with him to the real author, to whose genius he is doing homage, by openly giving the incidents and language to the Englrsh stage, as they stand in the original\u2014 -so much for the charge"], [6, "ADVERTISEMENT. of plagiarism which has been so liberally made against me. The ingenious adapter of \" The Promissory Note \" might as well have been accused of stealing from the farce of \" Husbands and Wives,\" because it pleased the compiler of the latter entertainment to dovetail \" La Lettre de Change \" with some extraneous matter, and thereby transform the neat and natural French piece into a very laughable, but certainly not equally intelligi- ble farce. The highly-respected proprietor of the English Opera House agreed with me in believing that some effect might be pro- duced by the different conduct of the old in- cident ; and the success of a All in the Dark,\" has proved that our belief was not a decep- tious one. To the above mentioned gentle- man, and to every lady and gentleman en- gaged in its production and representation, I return my most heartfelt ; acknowledgments.

I demanded an explanation from Blumenthal : he refused to give me one ; one word brought on another; passion overcame prudence, and for getting our situation as officers on duty, we drew, and attacked each other with fury; the garrison was alarmed ; the guard turn'd out ; each snatched up his pelisse and fled, I took, by chance, the road"], [14, "8 ALL IN THE DARK ; OR, to Miessen ; arrived here as night was closing ; before I could obtain the favour of a bed, I was obliged, as usual, to shew my \" feuille de route,\" judge my astonishment when, on searching for my papers, I discovered that, in the confusion of the moment, Blumenthal and I had exchanged pelisses.
