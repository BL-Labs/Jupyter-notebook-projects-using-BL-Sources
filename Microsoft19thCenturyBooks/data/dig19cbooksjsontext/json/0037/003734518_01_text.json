The French acknowledged 44 officers, and about 700 men : (to this we may add 2 officers taken, 197 officers and privates killed and wounded during the (lege.) Of the provincials, we may fay lefs ; but the unvariable report of deferters, and prifoners (gentlemen) fince exchanged, make their lofs above 4000 ; (thus it appears in the copy from the Gazette ;) among the wounded were Count D'F.ftaing, (in two places) Mr. De Fontange, major. general ; Count Polafky, fince dead ; and feveral others of diftinftion. We buried 231, and delivered 116 wounded prifoners, greater part mortally. Many were felf-burried in the mud of the fwamps, and no doubt many were carried of. On the 18th of Oft. the fog clearing off, about 9 o'clock, we were not much furprized to find the enemy had moved off. Gen. Prevoft men- tions the very aftive and zealous fervices of Capt.

We have been greatly obliged to Major Frafer, of the 71ft, afting quarter-mafler-general, for his zealous and indefatigable induftry, in landing, and mounting upon the batteries the cannon, ftores, &c. and conftantly fup- plying all wants.
