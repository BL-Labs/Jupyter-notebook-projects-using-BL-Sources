No place could be more peaceful thau the old quarry just beyond the grounds of Eedcot on a still, grey winter afternoon. The quarry had been abandoned by the masons who had once worked in it for at least a score of years. The men who had wielded mallet and chisel there, and caused the air to resound with the din of labour, or of rough-voiced talk and laughter at meal-time, had betaken them- selves to other quarries, or had lain down to a long rest from mortal toil. Kuid Nature's healing processes had gone on for so many V vol. I.

It stood veiled and garlanded by luxuriant drapery of bramble and briar, with bushes of elder and thorn springing -from odd niches, and tufts of gorse and bracken clinging for bare life to the merest crannies, until the old quarry had become a positive object of beauty in the landscape. Indeed, its attractions in this respect were sometimes fatal to its seclusion. Lovers of wild roses and of blackberries in their prime, seekers after birds' nests, hunters after certain kinds of butterflies, adventurous spirits with nothing else to do, were apt to invade the steep, broken recesses of the dis- used quarry, not without danger to the igno rant stranger. Tramps had been known to sleep there in passing, tinkers to squat there for a time. But that was in the height of"], [15, "THE WATCHER IN THE QUARRY -: summer. In November, when the vegetation was sere and russet, the very bramble leaves. with their hectic dyes, shrivelling up or rotting under the sharp frost or the heavy dew, which the sun. -when it did break forth, had not strength to lick up : when the birds, except in the morning, were nearly all silent, and only the white tail of a rabbit scudding to its hole. flashed a httle hght on the dim cheerlessne.^ of the scene, few persons were to be met with for weeks together near Redcot Quarry. For. as it happened, no by-road or right-of-way from village to village, no path frequented by school children, led past the place. The old road. which the masons had trodden when the quarry was in full operation, had long been as over grown and as much left to a not ungraceful neglect as everything else. But during the darkening days of the la^-t autumn and winter, one man had been. unknown to his little world, a daily fre quenter of the miniature precipices aud H 2"], [16, "BURIED DIAMONDS 4 yawning holes beneath the Redcot Quarry. He came there regularly at certain hours, and lingered for long intervals at points of vantage among the scattered hillocks. He tramped up doggedly, like a man unaccus tomed to be challenged ; yet there was an element of stealthiness in the tramp. He had the air of a man who had stolen away from his neighbours to indulge a craving, who did not wish to be observed in the indulgence. He was always careful in choosing a station among the rocks and underwood from which his figure could not be detected at the distance his eye could command, since the upper portion of the quarry afforded a tolerably wide view of the adjoining country, including the meadows of Ladslove as well as the woods of Redcot. The watcher was on the spot on the after noon referred to. He wras standing quite erect but partially sheltered from notice by a project ing mass of ancient debris, which did not prevent him from looking steadily down across"], [17, "THE WATCHER IN THE QUARRY 5 an uninterrupted flat space below, a good many acres in extent. He stood stock still. He had not moved for the last half-hour. It seemed as if the very muscles of the face, healthily coloured and tanned by an open-air life, were frozen into rigidity. The fields to which the gazer's attention was directed were stripped bare with the swept out emptiness of late autumn. Some of them had been already turned up by the plough and lay in heavy dark clods of earth. Others were pasture fields, but the cattle which had fed there had been housed for the winter, and the grass had the whitey-green sodden look which it assumes under a sunless haze and unformed frost, or under wet, pure and simple. A turnip field in which sheep had been penned presented yellowing, half-cropped leaves, and rooted up gnawed bulbs, in the middle of a waste of mire, but the sheep, too, having done their duty, were gone, and only the hurdles, falling down, and with many gaps, were left to tell the tale of"], [18, "B URIED DIA MONDS 6 the former occupants. Nothing was stirring even on the little stretch of high road which intersected the meadow-land ; no vehicle of any description ; neither pink-coat, nor horse, nor dog to suggest a meet far on in the day. No prospect could have been more blank than that which seemed to fascinate the watcher. If he was a poacher he carried no gun. He might be a gamekeeper from his shabby shooting coat and leggings, but the ungloved hands \u2014 long, with well-shaped nails \u2014 -were not those of an ordinary gamekeeper, and the soft felt hat shaded a leau lined face, which was not that of the typical yeoman. It betrayed traces of breeding and culture, running down through more than one generation. True, a king may look like a clown, but it was not so with John Prior, the squire of Redcot. He was as shabby in his outward man as squire could be. He was in the state of irritability, apprehension, and hopelessness, which is calcu lated to make a man careless in his dress, unless"], [19, "THE WATCHER IN THE QUARRY 7 he happens to be a martinet of the matter. He had never been handsome, though he was not without a certain air of distinction to begin with. He was tall and well made in figure, but in face his features were harsh aud irregular, culminating iu a heavy forehead. Yet the breadth of brow was striking, and the carriage of the head had been good. The eyes with the somewhat shaggv eyebrows were honest, intelligent eves, which in their day could return a quick response to the more than half-sup pressed smile, full of dry humour, of the large expressive mouth. But smiles had become strange to John Prior. His hair was almost white, though he was not sixty. He was acquiring a fleshless. dried-up look which rendered his natural disad vantages \u2014 the bullet shape of his forehead, the size of his jaw \u2014 more conspicuous. A perfect net-work of wrinkles was being lodged at the corners of his eyes and right across his fore head. The lines from the wide, nose to the"], [20, "8 BURIED DIAMONDS mouth, unshaded by moustache or beard, had become deepened and accentuated till a double prominence was given to the long upper lip. The large mouth would have been coarse but for its original humour and kindliness, and for what had replaced these qualities \u2014 a tumult of pain and trouble which for the most part com pressed the lips and only occasionally sent a rueful quiver through them, the result being a trifle tragic but not vulgar. Altogether, John Prior's face was rapidly becoming ugly enough to have figured in stone on a gargoyle, and aroused speculations in the much exercised nineteenth century critic as to whether it partook most of the absurd or the piteous, and what its sculptor could have meant by that grotesque, pathetic face. Poor John Prior's personality, both moral and physical, had been wrenched and gnarled. He had started in life with a strong side and a weak side \u2014 both stronger. and weaker than is the experience of the generality of his fellows \u2014"], [21, "THE WATCHER IN THE QUARRY 9 and the weak element was, as is perhaps not uncommon, bred of the strong \u2014 part and parcel of its passionate earnestness, vehemence, unreasonableness. He had been disappointed again and again in almost everything he had put his hand to or set his heart upon \u2014 very often as much by his own fault, by the temper which had made him hope or dream without measure or balance, as by the fault of another. But that did not render the disappointment less bitter, aud he was a man who took disappoint- ment as he had taken everything else, keenly and persistently, supping upon sorrow, without anjT effort or capacity to change the harsh diet. At first he fed on it in silence with a proud isolation ; latterly, as both pride and strength were fretted beyond endurance, he grew surly with the surliness at times broken by such a savage growl of suffering as a gentleman \u2014 not in look and descent alone, but at the core of his heart \u2014 could permit himself. John Prior was standing there in the dank,"], [22, "BURIED DIAMONDS 10 gloomy November afternoon, chilled to the marrow, for his blood ran more slowly with his loss of heart. He was keeping a forlorn guard on circumstances which at the same time he knew himself powerless to control. He was anticipating fate by a kind of fascination, as he would have gone out to brave and defy it in his hot youth. He wTas telling himself it was well to know the best or the worst of his misfortunes at once, without the loss of an hour, and he was sensible that at any moment while he lurked there in Redcot Quarry, as if he were an evil doer, the committer of an act of which he should be everlastingly ashamed, his doom and the doom of his wife and children might des cend upon him. It would not fall from the skies, but it might rise with its irresistible secret out of the insensate earth, after it had been probed and pierced. John Prior had not been guilty of murder.

Neither had he stolen some tempting wedge of gold and goodly Babylonish garment, and stowed them away in that obscure corner. For that matter the fields did not belong to him, and were not likely to have been selected by him as the spot where he was free to deposit his prey or his spoil, unless he entertained the base design of directing suspicion away from his guilty self to his guiltless neighbour. The meadows at John Prior's feet were part of a little farm called Ladslove, and had nothing to do with the estate of Redcot ; worse luck to the squire."], [24, "B URIED DIA MONDS 12 CHAPTER H. THE ADVANCE OF THE EXEMT. All the same these fields contained buried treasure for John Prior, long known to him and to none else in the same degree, pondered over and reckoned on as far as it could be reckoned without actual contact. It had been the object of his ambition ever since he had succeeded his father in the Redcot acres to buy this neighbouring farm \u2014 his only method of securing the ground which held the pearl of great price. But when he could have made the purchase the farm did not come into the market. Later, when the necessity of getting the land into his own possession, or at least of keeping it out of dangerous hands, had become"], [25, "THE ADVANCE OF THE ENEMY 13 a thousand times more pressing \u2014 even in com mon prudence, Prior was cruelly crippled in funds, and he had grown to entertain a fatal, overweening confidence in Ladslove's remaining with its original owner till a more convenient season. When this was to be, only a man of John Prior's peculiar temperament, with a warp of sanguine rashness thrown up broadly against a melancholy woof of doubt and despair, could have imagined. It was plainer and plainer, not only that the Redcot estate \u2014 in these bad days for agriculture \u2014 was of small account without its mines, but that the Redcot coal-field on its present level was nearly worked out. It had become so difficult and costly in the working that it could only be carried on at an outlay which barely paid its expenses, and left hardly a margin of profit. Side by side with the diminished gains was the unwelcome knowledge that the scale of the family living \u2014 simple enough in truth, and the income, not a great one, drawn by John Prior's only son, in place"], [26, "BURIED DIAMONDS 14 of being reduced in proportion, must, as a matter of necessity, continue very much what they were, with a tendency rather to increase than decrease. At last, when the squire of Redcot was well aware that the sole chance for him and his, since he had not the money to sink the Redcot pits deeper, lay in the supineness of an old-fashioned, ignorant yeoman, who cared more for the blooming surface of his fields than for the fire which might be in their breast \u2014 the security crumbled into dust. The yeoman, who held that blood was thicker than water, signed a bill for a tradesman brother-in-law. The brother-in-law broke ; the bill came due ; the surety could not meet it ; indeed, had other bills hanging heavily round his honest bull neck. Lambert Crabtree, the principal partner and manager of Crabtree's Bank in Newton \u2014 the next market town \u2014 took the farm with the consent of the panic stricken desperate debtor, in payment of the"], [27, "THE ADVANCE OF THE ENEMY 15 bad debt to the bank, and handed over the small amount of purchase mouey which ex ceeded the banking transactions, just enough to set up the dispossessed yeoman as a coal agent, whom Crabtree might favour by his aud the bank's patronage in Newton. The farm of Ladslove, in the ' lie ' of the Redcot coal-fields, according to mining statistics and traditions, in place of being John Prior's pur chase, was first the property of Crabtree's Bank, and next, by some private arrangement, the personal possession of Lambert Crabtree. But all is not lost that a friend gets, and if blood is thicker than water, it might have been a consolation to the proposed buyer who had lost his opportunity that the prize had not gone to an entire stranger, but to an old county neighbour, an acquaintance of long standing, more than that to John Prior's own son-in-law, Lambert Crabtree having married Susie Prior, the second daughter, at Redcot, eight years before."], [28, "16 BURIED DIAMONDS John Prior knew better. The marriage had been none of his making. He had disliked it from first to last, though he had no tangible excuse for opposing the match. He was sensible that neither ties of kindred nor personal feeling would hinder his son-in-law from hastening to make the best of his bargain. He was the last man likely to propose a compromise, as John Prior would have been the last to suggest one, though his silence had robbed him of his sole remaining chance. There was no hope of Lambert Crabtree's re-selling his recent acqui- sition, even if the squire of Redcot had been able to buy it \u2014 none of his (Crabtree's) dallying generously with his good fortune, or lingering with tender reluctance till a hoary head was laid under the turf. Accordingly, it was no surprise to the elder man to find the younger figuring without loss of time as a public benefactor and a man of the world, above private considerations. A party of experienced miners \u2014 one or two of"], [29, "THE ADVANCE OF THE ENEMY 17 them John Prior's former servants, supposed to hold the secrets of his mines, began to bore on Ladslove in search of the Redcot coal-seam, which had been hewn into and demolished in its original thickness and straightness, till its tapering and shallow point, full of ' hitches ' aud ' dykes,' was all that was left in the old ground. But there was plenty of scientific presumption that the opposite run of the seam under the lands of Ladslove carried it on in its pristine solidity and uniformity, a mine of black diamonds \u2014 hard as ebony in its jetty hue, rich in gas, perhaps cropping up near the surface, so as to be worked with little trouble or expense \u2014 a fortune to its happy finder. It was the boring party that John Prior watched, day after day, from Redcot Quarry, which commanded the Ladslove meadows, especially those fields accounted the most promising for the quest. The squire had been an enthusiastic geologist in his day \u2014 perhaps all the more so that, vol. I. c"], [30, "18 BURIED DIAMONDS though he was a coalowner, he was not a practical coalmaster ; that is, his pits were in the hands of an efficient manager. John Prior had felt the fascination of the science of the solid rocks which, to the eager student, is as full of charm as that of the vaulted sky. The one promises to lay bare the colossal history of past ages, the other allures with the dim glories of coming cycles of time. But this student could not have explained why mining rumour and geological data had failed so far, only he was convinced that he, and he alone, knew the very spot which woidd yield the treasure. It was not the point indicated either by popular behef or by scientific demonstration. The borers had boldly charged both spots without any results worth mentioning, for common tradition, like common rumour, is apt to he, and mineralogy, like other sciences, sometimes argues without its host. The rocks of the earth, whether deposited by floods or volcanoes, seem occasionally as if they took a perverse"], [31, "THE ADVANCE OF THE ENEMY 19 pleasure in appearing and disappearing at will, tilting up and sliding down, coming to a dead halt when least expected to stop, vanishing as if they were as transitory as the flowers of the field. Nevertheless, the master of Redcot was satisfied of the reality of his conviction. Away in the Dutch clover meadow to the right, as he looked down from the quarry, by7 the Rats' Ditch \u2014 an unusually deep ditch, almost as deep as the Redcot Well, the sides of which, when cautiously laid bare and narrowly examined, betrayed certain unmistakable traces \u2014 the lost coal was hidden. It might be elsewhere, radiating from the centre. John Prior was not prepared to affirm or deny the possibility, but the one hope that remained to him was that there wa3 but a single seam in this bed, and that the borers might miss it. Such narrow chances had been before now in the annals of mining. The ordeal had been already prolonged c 2"], [32, "BURIED DIAMONDS 20 over a period of months, since the harvest had cleared away the corn. Every day it seemed to the man, isolated and desperate in what was at once his torturing knowledge and his equally torturing ignorance, that the crisis approached nearer, that the busy matter-of-fact unconscious group of labouring men, with their shovels and picks, and their rods like divining rods, had more certainly the fortunes of the Priors of Redcot in a horny grip. Yet John Prior need not have contented himself with stalking in a stealthy fashion to his quarry of observation, and watching from afar the operations of the borers. He might have gone down among them openly, and looked for himself at what was drawn from the recesses of the rocks. He need not have scrupled to do so, even though, as had often happened, Lambert Crabtree, after his morning in the bank, took his afternoon ride to Ladslove, and stayed ten or twenty minutes hearing the report and examining the pile of ' rubbish.'"], [33, "THE ADVANCE OF THE ENEMY 21 There was no actual quarrel between the relations by marriage. There had never been any close friendship to be cruelly, if foolishly, wounded by the course Lambert Crabtree was pursuing. His conduct had been simply what might have been looked for in the man. John Prior was too proud to resent it actively, while Crabtree himself was too plausible to provoke such resentment. There had been a little gratuitous bluster on the delinquent's part, ignored by his father-in-law. The coolness between the men, who were naturally anta gonistic, deepened a shade or two ; but there was no open breach between the families; they continued on visiting terms. It was John Prior's free choice that he should look on from a distance at the decision of his fate. He had been doing it with few intermissions for a long time, and he felt he had become almost accustomed to the proceeding, though at intervals it struck him still as mad dening. After a little experience he had selected"], [34, "BURIED DIAMONDS 22 the period of the day when the men were in the habit of testing their success or failure, and of changing their stations, sinking or with drawing the boring rods, as the case might be. Sometimes, as had happened on the day referred to, the working party were delayed by officious advice and interference, or by an orgie the previous night and a corresponding fit of lazi ness the following morning, such as colliers of all men are prone to, and the gang had barely got time to put up their gear, when darkness had intervened and set them free. On other days the men would work diligently, as with a private impulse of confidence and alacrity ; for if there were pits at Ladslove as well as at Redcot, competition would force the masters' hands, and the colliers would be able to name their own wages. Their good time would have come. Every now and then the borers approached perilously near the Dutch clover meadow and the Rats' Ditch. Once they were actually"], [35, "THE ADVANCE OF THE ENEMY 23 within a few yards of the former, and John Prior's eyes grew dim and his heart stood still. There was no dinner for him that evening, no sleep that night. But nothing came of the accidental hit, and the next planting of the apparatus was further than ever from the goal. It was like a game which children play when one of them hides some article fixed upon, and the others, who have been shut out of the room, troop in and seek, the hider looking on, his eyes sparkling with the pride of power, and shouting ' hot ' or ' cold,' to encourage or deter the seekers as they approach or recede from the object of their search. The master of Redcot had seen his grandchildren, full of glee, playing at the game on one of these last evenings. It had faintly recalled similar sport among his children almost a generation back, in which he, still a young man, had been inclined to join on occasions \u2014 on a birthday or on Christmas Eve. This conversion of the game into grim earnest was like a ghastly travesty of the children's"], [36, "BURIED DIAMONDS 24 gambols, and he was not without a crazy im pulse to complete the similitude by hoarsely calling ' hot as fire, my men ; ' 'nay, lukewarm,' ' cold as stone, you idiots,' as an appropriate chorus to the workmen's uncertain steps. At times, when John Prior's mind was not at full stretch, it relieved its oppression by straying a little from the purpose of his standing there, and from the November aspect of the quarry. He remembered former visits to the place at more genial seasons. He had a fancy that he had brought his young wife here just when the quarry had been deserted for a suffi cient space to permit the first fine sprouting of vegetation which had resulted in the tangled over-growth before him. He had stopped her from pricking her fingers by gathering the wild rose, which she stuck in the belt that women wore then, the belt to a white muslin gown another old-fashion. He had come here with httle Jack after the rabbits, and he rather thought the boy's first shot had reverberated from the"], [37, "THE ADVANCE OF THE ENEMY 25 rocks there. He had brought the little girls to show them the chaffinches' and wThin sparrows' nests among the bushes. Susie had always been the most forward, the most meddlesome. He had held the small hand tightly in his to prevent her snatching at the contents of the nests while she chattered. Once she had slipped away on the road home, run back and clambered over the stones, well nigh at the risk of the child's life, in order to pilfer to her heart's content. She had dropped the eggs and fledglings from her frock, breaking and bruising them, so as to leave behind her a murderous track that in fallibly condemned her. Jane, and even Jack, had cried at the wanton, wholesale destruction which Susie had wrought for her petty delecta tion, but the culprit herself had not been par ticularly penitent, in spite of strong representa tions and sharp chastisement. John Prior groaned inwardly over these earlier recollections before he dismissed them, pulled himself together, got rid with an effort"], [38, "26 BURIED DIAMONDS of the stiffness produced by his long continuance in one constrained position, scrambled down to the opening into the quarry, issued from it, and took his way by the offices and the stables to the house of Redcot. He walked wearily, not withstanding his struggle to the contrary. His gaunt figure drooped, his strongly-maYked face had a set harshness, a grey tint was stealing through the ruddy brown of his country com plexion. Indelible signs of his vigils in the quarry were beginning to be imprinted on the malleable iron of John Prior's outward man, and would never leave it till it fell away in the blurred colourlessness and shapelessness of death, after its first hard, cold seal had been pressed down, had settled for a time, and then yielded to the decay of all mortal things."], [39, "27 CHAPTER III. REDCOT INTERIOR, AND THE WOMEN OF THE FAMILY. John Prior walked to his house across a corner of what was more an old-fashioned paddock, with extensive shrubberies girdling a lawn in tersected by an avenue of lime trees, than any thing so imposing as a park. Redcot was of some antiquity, but no great dignity, unless that of age and rambling space. The building had been a farm-house at one time, but so venerable a farm-house that it became, after all, a question whether the place did not date back to a homely manor-house in the days when the lines between yeomen, squires, and farmers were by no means so sharp as in later generations. Picturesqueness had"], [40, "28 BURIED DIAMONDS not been aimed at in the low square building put down in a hollow, and encumbered with offices \u2014 some of which had been cleared away, while others, though empty and disused, re mained a monument of the unhesitating sim plicity of our ancestors, wdro were not ashamed of their apple-rooms and cheese-rooms, their barns and thrashing mills, their cow-houses and pig-styes, any more than of their stables and kennels, their dairies and poultry yards. The greatest improvement after the removal of the said cow-house and pig-stye had been in the gradual laying out of the lawn and shrubberies until they had attained a respectable amount of order and beauty \u2014 all the more attractive that the style was a little antiquated with stack shaped hollies and gable-pointed yews, and a pleasant garden opening out of a cunning labyrinth of shrubs. The scene was not marred in any way by Mr. Prior's pits. These were out of sight, sound, and smell, miles away on Kershaw Moor. Indeed, although mines and"], [41, "REDCOT INTERIOR 29 miners were at the root of the family prosperity or adversity, they did not come to any great extent into the Priors' outward life. The house was not heavily draped like the quarry. There was a prejudice a century or two ago against ivy and clematis, jessamine and roses, as promoters of damp, and nests for wasps, spiders, and earwigs. That prejudice rode roughshod over whole sets of utilitarian and straightforward householders. One advan tage of the absence of creepers was that the brick walls were as mellow and mossy as the garden wall, the passion for dryness having fortunately stopped short of perpetual scraping, pointing, and painting fiery-red. The windows had retained their stone mullions and small panes, as if in obliging anticipation of the freak of retrogression in modern taste, while, unen cumbered by leaves, the light was let into the long, low-roofed rooms with a cheerful prosaic candour, not so much approved by \u00e6sthetic dogma."], [42, "BURIED DIAMONDS 30 No doubt it was from a mere accident that so much remained the same within as well as without at Redcot. The master of the house on coming to his kingdom had been indifferent \u2014 rather averse to change. His wife had enter tained a romantic reverence and affectionate fondness for the early landmarks which had come home to her personal experience. The panelled rooms \u2014 oak in the dining-room, and painted, in Philistine defiance of darkness, a clear French grey in the drawing-room- \u2014 were as John Prior and his wife had found them, barring necessary repairs and renewals. There had been no complete clearing away of the original furniture. The one room was full of heavy mahogany and warm-tinted damask. The other wras distinguished by spindle-legged rosewood, pale brocade protected by paler chintz, and a superabundance of glass and gilt decoration in the form of mirrors and girandoles, chandeliers, picture-frames, time-pieces, and tables lacquered to their very legs. Additions had been made"], [43, "REDCO T INTERIOR 31 not always harmoniously.

John Prior came in by a side door into a dark hall, where gun-cases and fishing-rods shouldered an umbrella stand and pegs for hats and wraps, and where stuffed birds kept in countenance engravings too brown to be easily distincruishable.

John Prior planted himself on the hearthrug, with his boots not free from the clay of the quarry, set doggedly on the tulips and wall-flowers. There was no relaxation of his muscles or sigh of satisfaction. In fact, he wanted more comfort than he got ; he was looking round discontentedly at the absence of any preparation for afternoon tea, though five o'clock had not struck. He resented the silence of the only other occupant of the room, who had looked up on his entrance, and then resumed her book.

The offending Mrs. Prior did not look, on the most casual glance, like a woman deficient in natural feeling, though there was a certain patient peacefulness in her air and surroundings which might not be without its provocation to an irascible man. For a soft answer, contrary to the verdict of King Solomon, is sometimes the most aggravated offence to an angry dis putant. Mrs. Prior had never been, strictly speaking, a pretty woman. Her dress was old-fashioned \u2014 a lace shawl over a dark cashmere gown, and a soft white cap, shading silver-streaked hair.

She gave the impression that she must always have seemed rather homely and old fashioned, with a swTeet homeliness and old fashionedness that might have been one of her charms to a certain order of mind, especially when there was plenty of intelligence and no lack of gentle breeding in the simple plainness and dash of quaintness. Mrs. Prior's grey eyes were a little faded, but there lingered a light in them which con tradicted the inference that there had ever been anything lympathic or lifeless in the loyal conser vatism and unaffected genuineness of the woman. On the contrary, a reader of physiognomy might have guessed that the native sprightliness which in this age of sentimental analysis and sublime discontent with the whole structure of the uni verse, moral as well as physical, is fast becoming a lost feminine grace, had been one of Mrs. Prior's out-of-date attractions long ago. She d 2"], [48, "36 BURIED DIAMONDS might have had enough to say in her youth, though she was inopportunely silent at the present moment ; and though the vestiges of her early vivacity were only to be detected by sharp eyes, and just pulled themselves together, as it were, and came to the front again by fits and starts. In truth, Mrs. Prior had been left behind by most of her children. The eldest daughter, Alice, had married much earlier than her mother, and had seen far more of the world, haviDg gone to India with her husband. She had even been called on to face the great mystery of death at a date before that at which Mrs. Prior had become a woman by right of the love passages between her and John Prior. Susie had possessed from her babyhood more triumphant worldly wisdom than her mother had acquired in all her fifty-five years. Jane, the youngest girl \u2014 still a girl and still at home \u2014 had kept her terms at a ladies' college, and was one of the earned products of the age. Only Jack, the"], [49, "REDCOT INTERIOR 37 one son with his father's plain face and his mother's serene, sunny nature, did not drift away from her, but continued faithfully on the same level. And Jack Prior was foredoomed to be a scapegrace if it were but by his father's extreme disappointment because the son in whom he had centred his hopes showed no sign of retrieving in some unexplained manner the falling fortunes of the family. There was small justice in punishing Jack, because he did not fulfil unreasonable expectations for which the boy had given no warrant. But men like John Prior, the elder, however just in theory are seldom fair hi practice. In place of confirming the extravagant ideas entertained of him, young John Prior, dis heartened and almost driven desperate by his father's irrational displeasure, brought back a greater reputation for scrapes and debts than for honours from college, and drifted about in a desultory fashion, wasting his time among friends with whom he was wonderfully popular,"], [50, "BURIED DIAMONDS 38 who saved him from the hard necessity of living under the blight of his father's anger. At last Jack put the crown on his volatile follies rather than serious errors by suddenly taking what appeared an idle vagrant step in a lad who owned no more money than the allowance which his father could ill afford. The heir of Redcot went off on a voyage to Australia, without any apparent intention of becoming a colonist. Mrs. Prior was forsaken even by Jack, ex cept for the solace of the letters he sent to her, which, to do him justice, had come with toler able regularity and frequency hitherto. She was left to her low wicker chair in a particular corner by the Redcot drawing-room hearth in winter, and by a special window in summer, to her unintermitting supply of novels, her inter minable needlework, and her dog Tommy. The last was a superannuated, not particularly ami able blue Skye terrier. He had been in his bloom the children's cherished playfellow. He had even been a not unwelcome companion of"], [51, "REDCOT INTERIOR 39 the children's father when Tommy had been the most active and joyous of rabbit-hunters and ratters. In those days Mrs. Frior's domestic happiness was also in its bloom, as she some times said, comparing notes with Tommy in an aside half-pathetic, half-tenderly humorous, in accordance with the nature of the woman. But the dog's time of nimbleness and unclouded ardour in sport was over, just as the womau was taken down from the pinnacle which most mothers and mistresses of households occupy at one period of their lives \u2014 an elevation of unap proachable wisdom and cleverness in the eyes of their offspring and depeudants. Then a younger generation, with new standards and different wants, arises to pronounce with more or less impatience and carelessness or reverent reluctance, and regretful gentleness, that their predecessors are antiquated and insufficient in their ideas and capabilities. When Mrs. Prior found herself thus out stripped in the race of life by her daughters,"], [52, "BURIED DIAMONDS 40 there was undoubtedly a considerable amount of mild dignity in the manner in which she withdrew from the unequal contest, and en sconced herself in an elderly woman's fragment of a kingdom She showed herself resolute and almost satisfied to wait till these well-armed children of hers had need of her again. For deep down in the mother's heart there was a conviction, half proud, half humble, and wholly tender and true, that human life was hardly likely to run its course without her human skill and experience, of so little account at present, coming into request once more. It had been far worse for Mrs. Prior, and had caused an unhealing wound in her heart, to know that she was gradually becoming alienated from her husband. The reason for this was partly because her nature could not always touch his in the painful conditions under which he lived, but chiefly because she would not give up her son, whom he was doing his best to goad to destruction. The permanent"], [53, "REDCOT INTERIOR 41 good understanding and unshaken faith between mother and son, in spite of what John Prior considered his ample grounds for complaint and indignation, exasperated him. He was still farther hurt by his grievous knowledge that all harmony between him aud Jack was at an end, and that the father's confidence in the lad was gone as entirely as the elder man's high hopes and vaulting ambition. Settled resentment was very difficult for Mrs. Prior, and the process by which it was brought about exquisitely painful to her. But she did continue to resent her husband's attitude towards their son. The resentment, however, did not alter the fact that her woman's nature was in its very susceptibility and delicacy more liberal and juster than the far stronger, but at the same time more headstrong and self-centred, nature of the man. She made allowance for him, so that in the middle of her dumb anger her heart sometimes ached for her husband with a positive intensity of aching."], [54, "BURIED DIAMONDS 42 John Prior stood fuming on the flowery hearth-rug. Mrs. Prior sat entrenched among her belongings. At one side of her was the basket with the rolls of linen and skeins of silk for the qudts which she had been embroidering ever since anvbody could remember. Jane alleged with quiet disdain that any weaver could have woven better in a week at the most. At Mrs. Prior's elbow was her special book-case, in which the works of her favourite authors and the last volumes received from Mudie's were ranged. At the other side Tommy was stretched in slightly apoplectic slumber, whde he was carefully sheltered from the danger of stray kicks. Every now and theu she turned over a leaf of the book on which her eyes were fixed, where it lay in the comfortable hollow of the lap, formed by the raising of the small feet \u2014 hardly larger than Susie's \u2014 as they rested side by side on their footstool.

It was cold comfort, Mrs. Prior thought, for a man to come from the manifold troubles of the outer world into his own house, and not re ceive so much as a greeting given by those nearest to him. But what could she do ? She did not know what to say. When she had spoken to him about this last torture the other day she had only succeeded in galling him. If she spoke on indifferent topics he would accuse her in his mind, if not in his speech, of hypo crisy.

Mrs. Prior wTas sure her husband was thoroughly chilled and craved a cup of tea this afternoon, though he was apt to despise the womanish in dulgence.

The hour had not yet struck, and Jane would descend with widely-open eyes, and a dignified inference that she had been disturbed in important occupations ; while men hated the least fuss \u2014 if anything, objected more to it than to a slight delay. Did John remember what addition there was to be to the family party at dinner, and who had proposed riding over in the course of the evening ? Had he braced himself to bear the encounter in the conflict that raged within him, or had he forgotten the previous intimation, so that the disagreeable ordeal would take him by surprise ?

At last the clock struck* five, and with the striking Jane Prior walked in. She was over the middle height and fairer in complexion than the rest of her family, with an expression of candour as well as of power of one sort on her broad open forehead. There was a correspond ing look of sincerity in her somewhat cold blue eyes, which met her neighbour's fairly and fully, and in her full, straight, uncompromising mouth. The expression was impressive, and rather heightened her claims to being handsome. \" A fine girl \" was the epithet which rose to one's lips \u2014 well-grown, well-developed in every re spect \u2014 a healthy mind in a healthy body \u2014 a character in which the intellectual predominated over the emotional. Unless a mania for study"], [58, "46 BURIED DIAMONDS overthrew its balance, it could be safely trusted to act logically and consistently. Jane Trior was dressed with the strict severity of the last utilitarian mode, as opposed to the \u00e6sthetic standard and to Paris fashions. Her skirt was short, and not tight. She was destitute alike of* unnecessary puffings and swathings. She had no butterfly bows and streaming ends of ribbon, though she had well tied knots where knots were required, and the lace at her throat and wrists was as fresh and dainty as need be. The severity of her costume extended to the style in which her hair was worn. She had an abundance of hair, which had been flaxen in childhood, and was now what old-fashioned people call fawn or sandy-coloured. It was turned back from the square forehead, and wound round the head by the simplest, most orderly arrangement possible, which took the least time to accomplish, and when it was ac complished, was nearly incapable of disarrange ment by hat or bonnet, or even by pre-occupied"], [59, "REDCOT INTERIOR 47 hands pushing it from the temples, or restless fingers thrust through the tight folds. Alto gether Jane's toilet suited her admirably. She would have been out of place in trailing robes or caught- up flounces, such as Susie affected, in accordance with the last inspiration of her artist friends or her French modiste. Jane would have looked still worse \u2014 actually grotesque, with Susie's fondly-trained fringe straying in artful artlessness to the verge of her arched eyebrows. But the result, if arrived at by any consciousness of Jane's, was the fruit of an instinctive sense of fitness which belonged to the girl, and not of any elaborate consideration. Jane Prior came into the drawing-room look ing straight before her, and, going directly to the bell, rang for tea. Yet, she had a little the air as if she only saw in part what was passing around her \u2014 as if her mind remained busy with some mathematical problem or metaphysical question which she had lately been seeking to solve. She stood by the little table, which still"], [60, "48 BURIED DIAMONDS wanted its tray and cups, her hands hanging down, loosely clasped before her, as silent, though not as glum, as her father. The atmo sphere about her was meditative and engrossed, though not so as to cause her to forget the hour or neglect her duty of being there to ring for tea and pour it out. No light girlish chat was to be expected from Jane ; something more valuable perhaps, but not the current coin so easily exchanged in the intercourse of daily life. If she spoke just now U would be to make some brief unanswerable observation as to whether the water was boiling, or the cream as it should be, for Jane, though verging on asceticism in her personal tastes and practices, was strict in demanding the fulfilment of household obligations. Or she would address to her father some inquiry with regard to his old college classes and classics, which he could not refuse to answer, though at the present moment he felt inclined to regard it as impertinent. But it was Mr. Prior and not his daughter"], [61, "REDCOT INTERIOR 49 who broke the silence, which was awkward and constrained, between husband and wife, and quite unconstrained and very much a matter of course, where Jane was in question, between father and daughter. ' Where are the children ?

' They cannot leave the school-room,' an swered Jane with calm decision. ' I have had them near me the whole of the afternoon, yet Ally has not been able to parse half a page, Tom's spelling to dictation is frightful, and it really looks as if that boy Sam were never to know his letters.

The children will have Jane to turn to when I have ceased to be of much use to them ; their mother's contemporary is her natural substitute, doubtless.' So thought Mrs. Prior, and she contented herself with a casting vote on the side of such grandmotherly indul gences as Jane would hear of. She felt called upon to utter a remonstrance to-day, and either because of the rarity of the remonstrance, or"], [63, "REDCOT INTERIOR 51 because it was a welcome reminder of what, if Jane conducted the matter in her own way, as she was tolerably sure to do \u2014 would certainly be a relief to her, the interference was received very graciously.

' Yes ; I find I must begin immediately to look out for a governess,' chimed in Jane, briskly. ' The difficulty is where to get a thoroughly good one, for I wdl have no make-shift \u2014 no poor creature of a nursery governess with a little bad music and worse French to cover her boundless ignorance.

He remem- E 2"], [64, "BURIED DIAMONDS 52 bered the gratified pride with which he had first discovered his little daughter Jane's unusual amount of brain power, and the interest he had taken in its proper development. What had it all come to ? It had rendered Jane unlike other girls \u2014 at least the girls he had known \u2014 a gain doubtful in itself. She was self-reliant, certainly, but the self-reliance was not always agreeable. She was constantly occupied with her studies, and seemed to follow the pursuit of knowledge with unflagging zest. She did not seek for other entertainment than she could procure for her self at small cost. She had excellent health, in spite of her occasional eccentricities and ab surdities. But, after all, her mind and memory were not better endowed and equipped than the average mind and memories of fairly intelligent and industrious undergraduates. Yet she was an exceptional woman for the other women like daws to peck at, who had not been able to es cape entirely a shade of self-consciousness and pedantry, though being the real not the ficti-"], [65, "REDCOT INTERIOR 53 tious woman of culture, she was as free from such objectionable qualities as could reasonably have been expected. But John Prior had never been reasonable in his expectations, and he had not counted on the possible loss involved in Jane's acquirements. Neither was he reasonable in his apprehensions. He never knew when Jane might not make some extravagant display of the student or professor in petticoats, when she might not propose to quit Redcot and the protection of her father and mother, in order to take the head of a grammar school for girls, if such a place existed, or such an appointment came in her way. He should not like it, though he was, according to his own belief, to a great extent free from class prejudices, and though his youngest daughter was neither particularly useful \u2014 apart from her care of the little Woods \u2014 nor particularly ornamental at home, neither could she be said to contribute much to the sociality of the family. If it had been her brother who inherited Jane's brains"], [66, "BURIED DIAMONDS 54 something might have come of them, and Jane might have had Jack's senselessly light-hearted temper and dangerously-accommodating ways, which were worse than useless in a man, with some advantage to a woman and a stay-at-home daughter. But, then, everything had gone wrong with the squire of Redcot, even to the distribution of character and ability among his children.

SUSIE AND LAMBERT CRABTREE. Before tea was over, a sudden stir in opening doors and advancing steps became audible in the Redcot drawing-room. Susie Crabtree en tered in the easiest, most graceful manner, with the most perfect security of a welcome. She brought in with her as the very atmosphere which surrounded her, in which she lived and breathed, a totally different influence from what had been there before she came. Susie Crabtree was a very pretty httle woman by nature. She was past her first youth, but she did her best by the adventitious aid of a choice and elaborate toilet, which more than supplies the early graces time steals away, in"], [68, "BURIED DIAMONDS 56 the eyes of many thousands of women, and of not a few men \u2014 though where the last are con cerned the substitute is only a vague charm to tickle the male fancy. Susie's beauty was of the daintiest, most fragile order, apparently, though in reality she had never known a day's illness that could not have been satisfactorily accounted for in the whole course of her life. She was small and brown beside her younger sister, but the small ness was a perfectly modelled fairy-queen sort of smallness, and the brown was the soft richly tinted olive of a brilliant brunette. The almond shaped dark eyes, with their glance hovering between a coquettish sparkle and a slightly languishing repose, were in keeping with the rest of the. face. So were the other features. The straight little nose was a trifle sharp, if it had not been for the beauty of the line from the brow, and the nostrils were thin and semi transparent. The short upper lip curled, while the under lip was just full enough to atone for"], [69, "SUSIE AND LAMBERT CRABTREE 57 a suspicion of narrowness in the red streak above it. The pearly teeth showed between. The chin was round \u2014 a shade too round, threat ening, in conjunction with the low forehead, a certain finer animalism as the years rolled on. But the years had not rolled on as yet, and Susie Crabtree was still httle beyond the zenith of her beauty, which wras preserved and greatly promoted, as she firmly believed, by the un stinted thought and time and the lavish expen diture of Lambert Crabtree's money freely devoted to that end. They had procured her bonnet, mantle, and gown from the most highly esteemed sources. For it must not be supposed that Mrs. Crab tree attempted anything by halves, or that she could not accomplish what she wished in the best manner possible. She was a clever as well as a pretty woman of her kind \u2014 one who had httle to do with book learning beyond the fair education for a woman of her rank. But this was enough to lend her all she wanted \u2014 a"], [70, "BURIED DIAMONDS 58 tolerable familiarity with the topics of the day, an easy assumption of the tone of her society whatever it might be, a curious tact, amount ing to mother-wit, which picked up, assimilated, and reproduced any scraps of the jargon of the schools, any morsel of affectation of this or that devotion to French criticism, German music, or pre-Raphaelite Italian art which, floating down the generations, drifted into queer corners. Anything so solid and thorough as Jane's know ledge would have crushed Susie with her airs and graces out of existence. Susie Crabtree had still less moral force and insight bred of largeness of heart, crystal-clear uprightness and delicately-keen conscientious ness than she had book-learning. But she had no end of savoir faire, and a good artistic taste, barring that it was subservient to one class of decorators and milliners, and one school of American authors, oddly enough. Mrs. Crabtree had been making some calls of ceremony before she came on to her father's"], [71, "SUSIE AND LAMBERT CRABTREE 59 place ; besides, she had no objection to exhibit her most charming visiting costume to her mother and sister. She had a secret impres sion that they must admire and envy it, though they did not seem very appreciative. Her mother looked at Susie's dress and praised it, certainly, but it was with a child's simple sur prise and pleasure, and, at the same time, with the good-natured indulgence which a grown woman might show to a child. Now, what Susie wanted was intelligent admiration, and a wistful craving \u2014 amounting to a flattering grudge against the wearer of the clothes \u2014 to be as beautifully and fashionably dressed as the wife of the county magnate, Lambert Crabtree, the Newton banker. Some ecstatic women would have called Susie's marvellously ' quiet,' but unapproach able, bonnet ' a perfect love.' Nothing could exceed the truth of the curves of her closely fitting mantle to the lines of her shapely figure. The velvet material, with its deep border of rich"], [72, "60 BURIED DIAMONDS fur, was sumptuous without gorgeousness, and though she was not tall enough to carry off splendour by stateliness, she did it by sheer elegance. The texture and hue of her gown were equally commendable in their delightful combination of softness, lightness, and a dead leaf duskiness, which was yet not ashen, but shot through and through with mellow russet. Her many-buttoned gloves and boots followed suit, so did her exquisite muff. There could be no doubt that Susie Crabtree was exceedingly well-dressed, according to the present artistic but not altogether rational or convenient fashion, and she beamed brightly out of her dress one of the prettiest women in the county. As this was the object of her ardent desires, its attain ment contributed largely to her satisfaction. For that matter, Susie was an extremely well- satisfied woman in nearly every respect. She had not all that she could wish, but she had almost all that was within her reach, and she was far too astute in worldly wisdom to cry for"], [73, "SUSIE AND LAMBERT CRABTREE 61 the moon. As a proof of her moderation, she was only slightly disturbed on the present oc casion by an irresistible, unwelcome conviction which occurred to her. Her unmarried sister had made the huge blunder of electing to be that odd personage \u2014 altogether undesirable, though less hooted at now than formerly \u2014 a full-fledged blue-stocking ; and here she was coolly regarding Susie's matronly honours and graceful magnificence without a particle either of fascination, homage, or aching covetousness. Susie did not deceive herself in reference to Jane's feehngs, but neither did she trouble her self to resent them. She was too contented to be cross, and liked popularity too well to make herself disagreeable. There might be something insolent in her happiness, founded as it was on her success in life, to unhappy and unfortunate people ; but the insolence was in the source of the happiness, not in the manner of its expres sion. Susie tripped into the Redcot drawing-room"], [74, "BURIED DIAMONDS 62 neither too fast nor too slow, so as not to miss something gliding in her gait. She kissed Mrs. Prior and Jane with due affectionateness, put up her face with filial fondness for her father to kiss, then subsided into her chair to be much made of, to make much of her relatives in a way that was hard to resist. ' Here I am, mamma and papa.' Susie retained the old childish terms which Jane had renounced long before. Mrs. Crabtree even gave them an additional babyishness \u2014 an affectation borrowed from some of her American cousins. She pronounced papa pa-pa, and mamma mam-ma. 'I am so glad to see you both, with Janie into the bar gain. How are the babies ? But I need not ask, for I saw the httle heads tolerably ruffled, in the matter of hair, through the schoolroom window as I passed.

Of course I can lay aside my bonnet and mantle, and Janie may let me have a fichu.

One has so little good of the moon in such cloudy weather, and the roads are so heavy for the horses ; and, what is"], [76, "BURIED DIAMONDS 64 after all the true state of the matter, I am such a timid little goose.' There was not a grain of feeling, shy or abashed, in Susie's manner \u2014 not a hint of being aware of the fact that her husband was at that moment poaching, as it were, on what had been the Redcot preserves \u2014 the sole coal-mines in the district for three-quarters of a century. There was not a shade of distress that his success in the search he was carrying out at Ladslove must mean sooner or later ruin to the Priors. There was not a Prior there \u2014 least of all John Prior \u2014 who could help feeling astonished by the ease and fluency with which Susie ignored the crow to pluck between the two houses. It was a pleasant philosophy that partook of effron tery. But, on second thoughts, every Prior, from the oldest to the youngest, was ready to admit that Susie's conduct was not only the best policy ; it was the least disturbing under the circumstances. The family felt relieved by"], [77, "SUSIE AND LAMBERT CRABTREE 65 it. They went near to owing her gratitude for it. Mrs. Prior and Jane began to talk, so far as to meet Mrs. Crabtree's amusing chat on the topics of the neighbourhood, and, with a slightly wider range, of the day, the whole having just the dash of purely personal and trivial details \u2014 such as the behaviour of her babies, the next dinner she was going to, the club-book she was reading \u2014 which kept it from sounding stilted and forced. Even Mr. Prior chimed in with a sentence occasionally. ' Have you heard that the Marlowes are going abroad in February ? ' said Susie, as fresh tea was brought for her. 'Yes, Mr. Marlowe told me yesterday,' answered Mrs. Prior, stroking down the lace at her cuffs, as she had a habit of doing. ' It is devoutly to be hoped,' continued Susie, with her lavish friendliness, ' that Mr. Marlowe will benefit much more by his flight from the spring east winds than he did last year.

I daresay it is not an invention of the British tradesman.' ' Have you heard whether Arthur Norris has taken a scholarship at Oxford ? ' asked Jane, while Susie dawdled with her cup. ' Yes ; a Balliol scholarship \u2014 the best going. His uncle is very much pleased ; so is every body,' declared Susie, sympathetically, ' and I should be enchanted if he needed help. How ever, his comparative wealth is unavoidable, and is not to be regretted otherwise. Besides, Mr. Norris says that where rich and poor alike go in for scholarships, it prevents their bestowal becoming a mere charitable institution, and lends them dignity. I'm sure I don't know about the dignity, but I'm ready to take it on Mr. Norris's word.' 'Why did Arthur not enter his father's college? George Norris was an Oriel man,' objected Mr. Prior."], [79, "SUSIE AND LAMBERT CRABTREE 67 'I can't tell, pa-pa. I daresay he thought Balliol more aristocratic, or influential, or some thing. Oh, Jane, do you know I am so delighted with the recent discoveries at Herculaneum ! \u2014 another tomb, and a torso of Hercules freshly excavated.' ' I think you are mistaken,' said Jane, with sensitive exactness. ' The tomb is at Bai\u00e6 aud the torso is of Bacchus.' ' Ah, well.' assented Susie in careless acquies cence.

' So it ran on in an enlivening, almost refresh ing flow, to which the Priors contributed a drop or two occasionally. In spite of himself John Prior was diverted from his care, soothed by the diversion and gently titillated. He came, indeed, under Susie's spell, not without a vague sense of self-contempt and a fresh sting dealt by me mory. There had been a time when he had been fool enough to hug himself on his charming little daughter's beauty and her winning ways as she grew from childhood to girlhood. Then he had been deeply morti-"], [81, "SUSIE AND LAMBERT CRABTREE 69 fied and aggrieved by what he had been powerless to prevent \u2014 her throwing herself away on Lambert Crabtree.

It was worse. The father felt forced to see that there was really no mental or moral dete rioration in Susie. In the spring-time of her attractions his child and her mother's child had never been actually above Lambert Crabtree in spiritual fibre. The marriage had been a clear instance of like drawing to like. The idea was detestable to John Prior. Lambert Crabtree did not hesitate to look in for a few moments at Redcot in the course of the evening. He came over ostensibly with the good-natured purpose of quieting his wife's nerves by riding home at the side of her"], [82, "BURIED DIAMONDS 70 carriage. Yet he was not ordinarily a gallant, though he was an exceedingly indulgent hus band. He gave Susie what she had bargained for in the marriage. She repaid him in the same coin. When the transaction was com pleted they did not see much of each other. They appeared to have tacitly agreed to go their several ways \u2014 which were not similar ways \u2014 as independently as any couple like them, who are still on perfectly amicable terms. Susie was thankful that she had escaped the narrowing circumstances at Redcot with the growing morbidness and moodiness of her father's temper. She was highly gratified by her kingdom at Newton. Lambert Crabtree got from Susie all that he wanted. He remained proud of her beauty and pleasant ness. He appreciated her sense in not asking from him what he could not give. Still these terms, excellent as they were so far, were hardly the kind which cause a husband to take a lono ride after the work and worry of the day, in"], [83, "SUSIE AND LAMBERT CRABTREE 71 order to share an expedition of his wife's, and have an hour or so more of her society. Susie's husband was big and red, with pro minent light eyes. He was fifteen years older than his wife, while he affected a somewhat youthful, sportsman-like style of dress, was fond of white cords, coloured vests, and coloured neckties, and altogether was coarse-looking for a man of gentle birth. He did not take off his riding-coat, and came into the Redcot drawing room with his whip hanging out of one pocket. John Prior received his son-in-law with scrupulous politeness, though he would not come to close quarters with him. Lambert Crabtree's tactics were totally different from his wife's. In place of strictly avoiding any allusion in the conversation between the two men to the cause of mortal offence the younger was giving ; in place of getting up a mist and glamour of in different talk on every conceivable topic, the intruder would have approached the subject with constitutional brazenness and bluster, and"], [84, "BURIED DIAMONDS 72 endeavoured to have made his own out of it. He was quite capable of saying, ' You know business is business, Prior. We men understand that we must look after our own interests, and leave the devil to pay. We need not pretend to mawkish sentiment because we cannot avoid treading on each other's corns as we go our various ways.' It was more than probable that the Priors owed the brief pleasure of Lambert Crabtree's company to some half- formed intention of taking the bull by the horns, to serve the challenger's ends. One of Susie's witty affectations was to call her husband invariably by a pretty abbre viation of his name, which was grotesquely in appropriate. 'Wolf would have been more like the man, John Prior had growled, ' net that Susie is anything of a Red Riding Hood.' But John Prior was slightly prejudiced. The big red-faced banker of squire descent was nearer a bull-dog ; he had nothing of the nobility of a mastiff hanging on like grim death"], [85, "SUSIE AND LAMBERT CRABTREE 73 to his prey. There was a certain bluffness in his burhness which, to be sure, went a long way with some people in persuading them of his honesty, and a clumsiness in his utmost cunning that disarmed invidious suspicion, but which nevertheless did not belong to the true wolf or fox breed. Mr. Prior had no difficulty in distancing Crabtree, when he made such obviously tenta tive speeches as 'Nasty raw weather, bad for field operations of all kinds. Push and pluck are nowhere in such an atmosphere. Nothing but hunting keeps a man's blood in circulation. Hang it ! the poor devils who have to stand about on your coal hills and pit heads which I passed on my ride are to be pitied unless they keep up jolly furnace fires and have recourse to them every five minutes.

He would not fling out the sneering retort \u2014 ' Boring is not warmer work than stacking coal \u2014 is it ? ' His reply was strictly to the point, while it was as freezing as the air com plained of. ' No, the weather don't signify to speak of. The men are accustomed to exposure, and for those who are below ground the temperature is much the same at all seasons.' His stern impassiveness and his adhering to his own side of the question baffled his assail ant, who could bully or swagger, or even cajole a little, but who could not go about the bush to any purpose. He was forced to turn aside to Mrs. Prior and Jane, ' How goes the last novel, mamma ? ' he also said mamma with a cool as sumption of intimacy. ' Tommy not showing any symptoms of mange, I hope ?

Jaxe Prior set about her inquiries for a governess on behalf of the httle Woods in the most exhaustive fashion. The children were young, and were still only in the elementary stage of their education ; but Jane had deter mined that the rudiments should be well seen to. She was an ardent supporter of the modern opinion that the foundation is of paramount importance, and that the insufficient foundations laid by incompetent hands are largely account able for the failure in general knowledge, even in general capacity, of the present generation. Jane went far to believing that a thorough acquaintance with philology is necessary for"], [92, "80 BURIED DIAMONDS the proper teaching of the alphabet. She must have had a hankering for the first letters to be Greek or Hebrew, but here her common sense interposed. She was determined at least that poor Alice's children should have the chance of becoming deeply erudite prodigies of ' all-round ' culture. They should have such advantages as Jane herself had not enjoyed. Yet her father and mother had done the best they knew of for her. John Prior had even taken pains, when he learnt the talents and tastes of the girl, to impart something of his own college training to her, by making her read along with her brother Jack under a Cambridge coach of some eminence. But then this was comparatively late in Jane's life, and she still suffered, as she honestly believed, from having been taught her letters by Alice and Susie's old governess. She had been an exemplary, old-fashioned lady, who was so inconsistent as to pique herself on her pro ficiency in such modem languages as French"], [93, "IN SEARCH OF AN 'ADMIRABLE CRICHTON Si and Italian, when she had never been taught a word of Latin, who could triumphantly produce a musical certificate from a German conserva torium, but whose arithmetic was not strong enough to have secured her a situation as bookkeeper in any tradesman's shop. Jane, with an almost pathetic sense of her latent deficiencies from early neglect, went about her search for an efficient governess, where her small niece and nephews were concerned, in the most earnest, methodical manner, profoundly impressed as she was with the importance of the appointment. Nothing moved her. She was unscathed by her father's sarcasms on the uselessness and the cost of the acquisition. For Alice Prior had married a man in the civil service who had not been very fortunate in his career and was still struggling up-hill in his profession, so that John Prior had undertaken as a matter of course the rearing of the children sent home to their dead mother's relatives. vol. I. G"], [94, "BURIED DIAMONDS 82 Mrs. Prior's natural alarm at the intrusion of another learned woman into the family fell still more flat. Jane told her mother with the utmost conviction that not only would a female Porson condescend to teach the young idea how to shoot without a thought of condescen sion ; she would be struck by a grand compre hensiveness of the undertaking, which would have utterly escaped the shallow conclusions of pert frivolous ignorance. Then why did Jane herself not devote all her energies to the noble enterprise, and sacrifice everything else? Just because Jane did not feel equal to it. She was by no means fully equipped as yet ; she had a great deal of solitary study before her, ere she could aspire to have fairly grappled \u2014 even grappled \u2014 with the branches she had taken up, and she had that lamentable instability of foundation which she was afraid would cripple her to the day of her death.

These ladies were very inferior to poor old Miss Rossiter, with her good music and her halting arithmetic. Yet Miss Rossiter had been a little hard to please as to the boiling of her egg for breakfast, and the shaking up of her feather bed. But if the new comer were like Jane, she would be simple enough in her tastes. Jane Prior was utterly impervious to the hght ridicule of Susie and the broader ' haw haw' mockery of Lambert Crabtree, who heard their children conning their A, B, C to their rustic nurse, and jabbering the most fright fully illiterate French with Mrs. Crabtree's maid.

Even Jane Prior's infinite capacity for taking pains was sorely tried, and showed signs of suddenly and ignominiously collapsing, when the right woman presented herself at the right time, as if by a special interposition of Providence. Jane heard of a Miss Gray, who, according to hearsay, was all Jane's fancy painted the perfect governess or schoolmistress, as the last development of the female teacher prefers to be called, returning proudly to the old unvarnished title. She had been trained in a coUege of preceptresses ; she had passed more or less stiff examinations with credit, nay distinction ; she had already gained some experience as a teacher, though she was not more than three-and-twenty \u2014 Jane's own age. Miss Gray was vouched for as the daughter of a professional man of unexceptionable ante cedents. She had been early left an orphan, with a patrimony that just sufficed to give her"], [98, "BURIED DIAMONDS 86 an excellent education, consequently she had been brought up to maintain herself. In spite of Jane's burning zeal for loftier attributes, she was not indifferent to the consideration of Miss Gray's birth and early associations. Jane Prior had at least her share of the prejudices, so called, of her class. ' Gray is a good name,' she said, dwelling on it with satisfaction, ' though, of course, there are Grays and Grays,' she wound up judicially, not pausing to explain whether the Gray which tended to whiteness or the other Gray, which, running down in the scale, bore on blackness, had to do with moral blamelessness and turpitude, or simply ranged from aristocratic to democratic proclivities. Apparently nothing was lacking in Miss Gray, and, for a wonder, the conscientiously explicit statement with which Jane furnished her as to terms, privileges, and the duties of the post she was expected to fill at Redcot, also lacked nothing in her eyes. For that matter,"], [99, "IN SEARCH OF AN 'ADMIRABLE CRICHTON' 87 if Jane Prior had only known it, Miss Gray had set her heart on coming to Redcot even more than Jane had set hers on securing the ph\u0153nix.

Every preliminary was arranged, the day was fixed for the lady's arrival ; the only thing that remained to be done was for Miss Prior to make use of the old phaeton, all that was left available of the Redcot carriages, to drive to Newton and meet the stranger at the station. Jane was punctilious in this piece of courtesy, though it cost her a whole afternoon of Plato's company. Mrs. Prior seldom went from home, and even when the social duties were less her daughter's particular business, Jane was toler ably well accustomed to act, with a wry or rueful face, as her mother's deputy. She was"], [100, "BURIED DIAMONDS 88 determined Miss Gray should not find herself treated from the first otherwise than as a valued friend and guest of the family in which, it was to be hoped, she would dwell for a period of years.

All the same, the days of her mourn ing as a governess who was systematicaUy overlooked, or contemptuously hustled aside, or even rudely snubbed, were ended. Whether she fraternised with the unmarried daughter of the house, as Jane for one ardently desired, or not, Miss Gray might depend upon being received with the respect due to learning \u2014 to a competent instructress of youth. Jane would no more have thought of slighting her niece ai.d nephews' governess, than an undergraduate,"], [101, "IN SEARCH OF AN 'ADMIRABLE CRICHTON' 89 however idle and thoughtless, would dream of openly insulting a college tutor. Therefore, while fully measuring the \"wrong done to Plato, and the loss to herself, Jane found a severe satisfaction in making the sacri fice as complete as possible. She was at the Newton Station in such good time that she had to wait a quarter of an hour for the arrival of the train ; but she did not spend the entire interval pacing the platform in solitude, except for the porters. Before the train was due Mrs. Crabtree appeared. Of course, she was known to the stationmaster \u2014 when it came to that, he knew the whole neighbourhood. But while Jane and he did not think it necessary to ac knowledge their acquaintance by more than a slight bow on the one side and two fingers to the hat on the other, Susie had to interview the official graciously.

Susie put httle pertinent inquiries as to the"], [102, "BURIED DIAMONDS 90 amount of traffic on the line, interspersing them with small sympathetic regrets \u2014 amounting to exclamations of personal distress, ' Mr. Panton, you don't say so.

Mrs. Crabtree was on the platform on some trifling pretexts of half expecting friends from London \u2014 these Miss Smiths who had disap pointed her so often, and of wishing to give a note with her own hand to any messenger from Redcot who might be at the station. She pro tested she had not hoped to see her sister. ' You here, Jane ! ' she exclaimed with quite a marked note of surprise, arching her fine eye brows. ' Yes, where else should I be ? ' demanded Jane, with a flavour of asperity in her tone, drawing down her straight light brown brows, in decided contrast to those of her sister. These two were always in contrast. They had never understood each other or harmonised together.

But from childhood"], [104, "BURIED DIAMONDS 92 she sisters had not amalgamated or even bridged over the gulf between their natures and tastes. The pair had not quarrelled ; their interests had never clashed. The women had agreed to differ, but there had been little satisfaction in the near relationship.

' You can tell mam-ma that I am in despair because I have not found the cleaner's address for her. I shall hunt all over the house, and perhaps I may be more fortunate.'

It would have saved you a cold, dark drive.' ' Thanks,' said Jane, not very cordially. ' I don't know that it would quite have answered the purpose \u2014 even though you had happened to be here at any rate,' she ended, with a slightly sarcastic emphasis. For both she and Susie were sensible the real motive of Mrs. Crabtree's presence was that she might have the opportu nity of satisfying her curiosity even about a person of no more consequence in her eyes than the httle Woods' governess. Do not let any mistake arise. Susie would be thoroughly polite and kind, almost oppressively kind, to Miss Gray, but it would not be as Jane \u2014 notwithstanding her strain of formality and dryness \u2014 was friendly. It was so late, the afternoon was getting so dusky, and the smoky lamps of Newton Station were so few and far between, that if Susie Crab-"], [106, "BURIED DIAMONDS 94 tree's eyes had not been Argus-eyes, and her observation \u2014 as far as it went \u2014 quick, keen, and sure, she could have made very little of what she saw when the train came in .

Finally, Miss Gray was ushered into the Redcot phaeton, established in it, and driven off with the least possible delay, and the fewest words of introduction or leave-taking between the ladies.

They are ridiculously slow in getting their lessons done, yet I don't believe either Ally or the boys have bad abilities, while I have been anxious not to begin by shirking anything.' Miss Gray was silent. There was even a little involuntary movement of her shoulders, which was more like protest than assent. 'No doubt you will have a much better method,' said Jane modestly. ' You understand the science of teaching. You will remedy the defects of my system.'"], [111, "A SYREN ADVENTURESS 99 ' I'll do my best,' said Miss Gray quietly ; 'but you must not expect too much from me.

' Certainly, but you are not going to be a stranger, and all children with the average amount of brains can be taught a great deal when it is done systematically. The thing is for the pupils to acquire the habit of learning at every moment, at every pore,' declared Jane, rising to the occasion, and speaking not only didactically, but with the enthusiasm which was generally held more in reserve with her. Miss Gray did not go on contradicting one of her employers, the late directress general of the little Woods' studies. Perhaps the new comer did not think that persisting in an attitude of opposition would be either wise or worth while. She had some experience of the relations in which she stood to the experi- H 2"], [112, "BURIED DIAMONDS 100 menter and the objects experimented upon, and she might look upon Jane's excellent senti ments pushed to extremity as a bushel of theory which an ounce of practice would reduce to its true proportions. Or she might be too much occupied looking about her to care to prolong a useless argument. She did show a commendable desire to become ac quainted with her future surroundings. She peered through the darkness as the couple drove up the elm avenue. She paused a second looking up at the weather-stained house, and casting a rapid glance round the lawn and shrubbery lit up by the open hall door, as if she wished to take everything in before she entered. Jane acted as a pioneer in conducting her companion through the labyrinths created by the superfluity of pillars and furniture in the hall ; took her past the ghastly Judas \u2014 ghast lier than ever in the lamplight \u2014 up the stairs, and decided that, as it was so late, it would be"], [113, "A SVREN ADVENTURESS 101 better to show her at once to her room, and leave her to make whatever change of toilet was possible for her before dinner. When Jliss Prior was gone, Miss Gray rid herself of her encumbrances of hat and ulster. Then, though she had been told she had only a few moments to spare, she began to waste them scandalously for a person supposed to be endowed with the promptness and punctuality so desirable in a teacher of babes. She stood idly before the fire, busy only with her re flections. Here was a better opportunity than Susie Crabtree had commanded at the station for seeing what the young woman, standing alone and off her guard, in the warm glow of the hearth, was hke. In the first place, Miss Gray had not yellow hair, nor hair that by any stretch of imagination could be called golden, or even red; neither was it raven-black. Pier eyes were not violet, neither were they of in scrutable darkness of hue. Her complexion"], [114, "BURIED DIAMONDS 102 was not pink and white like daisies : far less was it colourless as marble or creamy as ivory. She was not divinely tall, or of a dainty small ness. Yet she was fair to see, notwithstanding these trying negatives and the other dishearten ing facts which have to be recorded. She was about the middle si/o. Her hair was simply a chestnut brown. Her eyes were nothing more than hazel. Her colour was of such a healthy depth as well as purity that it was in danger of getting too red, as on the present occasion, and spreading, as it had spread now, under the in fluence of the cold drive, and of the sudden transference to the genial warmth of the room, to the tip of her chin. This chin was itself a blemish in her face, for it was a little too square for beauty. But her teeth were white and regular.

Miss Gray did not look in the least like a Becky Sharp or a Lady Audley. She had all the appearance of a -wholesome-hearted, sound, natural, Enghsh girl under her supposed load of learning, as happy as the deprivations of her orphan lot and the burden of her responsi bilities would let her, probably more self reliant and womanly, instead of girlish, than she would have been without the deprivations and the burden. But contradictions will never cease. The fresh, honest, comely face was showing itself greatly excited in the sliifting light. If any body could have read Miss Gray's thoughts they would have seemed sufficiently mysterious for an innocent genuine individual in her cir cumstances. She was thinking, ' So I am actually here. I have succeeded in my enter prise \u2014 however much I may repent it. And that was Jane, whUe the other was Susie !"], [116, "BURIED DIAMONDS 104 Strange, to meet them in flesh and blood, and they to regard me from a totally different stand point without having the slightest suspicion why I should be deeply interested in them ! Upon the whole, from the little I have seen of the sisters. I believe I shall prefer Jane; though Susie is wonderfully pretty, and I fancy he has a favour for her \u2014 I fear, I fear, on his weak side, poor fellow.' And Miss Gray shook her head wistfully, deprecatingly, with a kind of precocious womanly wisdom. Miss Gray's train of thought was remark able \u2014 out of a novel. It was decidedly un warrantable \u2014 not to say objectionable \u2014 in a young woman who had not all the airs of a syren adventuress stealing into a guileless household aud working incalculable havoc there. She might have committed the further in discretion of being late for dinner on her first evening, but she was interrupted in time. There was a tap at the door. When Miss"], [117, "A SYREN ADVENTURESS 105 Gray opened it she found Mrs. Prior on the threshold. There was no mistaking the mis tress of Redcot. though she had not waited for an introduction to the new inmate of her family, and she had just received from a servant a salver with wine and cake. She had overcome the reserve which was growing on her in order to supply what she guessed had been an overlook on Jane's part, though there was still a reflection of the reserve in Mrs. Prior's heightened colour, and the slight em barrassment in her air. But her old-fashioned dignity and politeness, mingling with the hospitahty that caused her to serve the stranger herself, prevented the hostess from being really flurried. 'I beg your pardon, Miss Gray, but my daughter ought to have seen that you had some refreshment as soon as you arrived, be fore you attempted to get ready for dinner. Don't trouble to make much change hi your dress ; we are old-fashioned country people,"], [118, "BURIED DIAMONDS 106 and you must be tired after your long jour ney.' Miss Gray had remained dumb ill positive consternation. Something about Mrs. Prior and her entrance overwhelmed the girl. Her carnation colour deepened to crimson, and flooded her face and neck. She started for ward with a little distressed cry. ' Oh ! don't, Mrs. Prior, you are a great deal too good,' she exclaimed. She took the salver from Mrs. Prior's hands, set it down with trembling fingers, and stood hke a delinquent with cast down eyes, which, if they had been raised, would have been found suddenly brimming over with tears, before the simple, kindly, elderly lady. Mrs. Prior in her turn was disturbed by the sensation she had created. In the later years of her life she had become accustomed to find ing herself frequently called to account for not being on a level with a younger generation in knowledge of the world and its wickedness, and"], [119, "A SYREN ADVENTURESS 107 of undreamt-of standards of propriety. She be_ran to dread that she had committed a crave solecism in the trifling piece of attention she had paid Miss Gray, else she \u2014 Mrs. Prior \u2014 could not have so upset the new-comer, the fully-armed, all-accomplished young ladv whom Jane had selected, who was to be Jane s friend. The offender could only take comfort in the consideration that the offence was a small matter after all. Then she fell back on the blamelessness of her motive, and recovered her equanimity as she withdrew. But if Mrs. Prior recovered her equanimity, Mi\u00bbs Gray lost hers. She made a gesture the moment she was left by herself, as if she would have covered her face with her hands, and cried half aloud \u2014 ' Oh ! I am afraid I have been very wrong. How shall I carry out my purpose \u2014 if I ought to carry it out and not relinquish it at the outset? To have Ms. Prior \u2014 how sweet and dear she looks ! I"], [120, "BURIED DIAMONDS 108 don't wonder that he is very fond of her \u2014 wait on me in this character, is too dreadful.' But youth is mercurial. Soon Miss Gray not only turned to her toilet, she bestowed on it an amount of anxious consideration which some people would have thought totally un worthy of a learned lady. In place of slipping out of one dress and into another with the celerity acquired by long practice, and scarcely a glance into the mirror, which was Jane's way, Miss Gray thought and hesitated. She opened her solitary trunk, and slowly took from it some trifles of gloves, shoes, and lace, then reluctantly shut it again, after she had indu'ged in one peep to see that no injury had been inflicted, in the packing, on the single gown it contained \u2014 a dehcate expensive gown of palest, softest plush. 'I dare say Jane will be severely plain,' the stranger reflected, ' and her mother im plied something very simple \u2014 such as might be supposed to suit a governess's purse \u2014 for me."], [121, "A SYREN ADVENTURESS 109 This old black silk, which I have worn under my ulster, may do very well. It will be more in keeping. But, oh !

But, if I could, I should so have liked to make a good impression on them the first night, as he would wish, if he knew.' The tliinker drew a long sighing breath. ' I might have taken the bull \u2014 that is, the formidable old gentleman \u2014 by the horns and by storm.

'This is the very prettiest I have ever had, and, though I may have many more, tiny will never be like the first. It will lie and fade and soil, perhaps get old-fashioned as well as shabby before I have a chance of putting it on. Well, as if that signified. What a goose I am ! ' She suddenly pulled herself up, and made a gallant stand against her folly. The old, big dinner-bell \u2014 there had never been a gong at Redcot \u2014 pealed forth with a crack in its voice. Miss Gray salhed out in her characteristic"], [123, "A SYREN ADVE.\\TURESS 111 black silk gown, in which, however, she looked bonnie enough, like a blushing June rose set among its dark leaves, and followed the servant sent to show her the way to the drawing-room. Miss Gray was introduced to the master of the house, who treated her as a gentleman treats a lady, but for anything further took very little notice of her, so that the trepidation with which she had been fencing, which she had been pain fullv keeping under strict control, might have been spared. The dinner was quiet. Mr. Prior was taci turn, Jane was in one of her brown studies. Mrs. Prior had to make conversation on the weather, whether Miss Gray was fond of the country, whether she liked walking, &c, &c. The hostess had got so much out of the way of that particular service to society, in winch she had never been a brilliant woman, in spite of her liveliness in private, that she did not play her part with great effect, and desisted from the effort as soon as she civilly could. She was"], [124, "BURIED DIAMONDS 112 driven to regret that there was no diversion caused by the presence of the children at dessert. When the ladies went to the drawing-room, Jane engaged Miss Gray over the programme of the children's lessons. Mr. Prior had his ' Quarterly,' Mrs. Prior her book. There was a little music, which was proposed as something more social and genial by Mrs. Prior. She contributed to it in the first place \u2014 playing an old-fashioned piece \u2014 not that she cared to play, or was very fond of music, but Jane was no musician, and Jane's mother had a fine sense that Miss Gray should not be allowed to feel as if her accomplishments were being trotted out.

The performance was quite satisfactory, without being anything marvellous."], [125, "A SYREN ADVENTURESS 113 The servants came in to prayers, and the whole household retired earlv. It was a somewhat bald realisation of a scene which had been anticipated often by one person present, and never without a thrill of emotion.

She had directed manv an intelhgent glance to the objects around her \u2014 the icy mirrors, the side tables with their gdt legs, the floral rug. She had watched covertlv but breathlesslv, as if with a kind of fascination, the unconscious. sombre figure of the master of the house, seated at his own httle table, with his shaded lamp, restlessly fluttering the leaves of his magazine, and occasionally leaning back, and tapping with his paper-knife on the arm of his chair, not in time to the music, rather as if it were in an irritable accompaniment to his troubled thoughts.

'How peacefid and beautiful it is,' the gazer considered. ' It is charming ; oh ! dear, one coidd be so happy here, if everything else were as right as the dear old house.' Then straightway Miss Gray resumed her former erratic hue of meditation, with a renewal of the tendency to sum up the knowledge she had gained. ' And this is Redcot ! I am really here,' she told herself in short, fragmentary eja culations of wonder which could hardly beheve itself, and was not unmixed with apprehension and repentance. ' I declare,' as she stared out, 8 that must be the mulberry tree under which the children kept house and played.

Well, Tommy has not the second sight, that's clear, else he might have detected a faint flavour of Jack, who was always good to him ; I'll vouch for that. ' I've seen every one of them. I've only the children to be introduced to to-morrow. Will the grown-up people ever forgive me, and take kindly to me after this ?

A TUG OF WAR AND A FLAG OF TRUCE. When Miss Gray got up next morning, she found her way to the schoolroom, and met not only her future pupils, but Miss Prior, at her former post, awaiting her successor. Jane Prior always looked particularly well the first thing in the morning. Her style of dress, with its straight lines, comparative scan tiness of detail, and absence of superfluity, while it was in clanger of looking stiff and hard in a light evening gown, harmonised much better with the thick, dark woollen stuff or the plain uncompromising calico which was in use for morning wear in winter or in summer. All that was clear and open in her face seemed"], [131, "A TUG OF WAR AND A FLAG OF TRUCE 119 to belong by right to the dawn of day. The searching light revealed nothing that was meant to be hidden away and cunningly concealed. All was frank and above-board, from the freckles on the broad forehead to the lock which, obeying a vagrant inclination known in local phrase as ' a cow-fleck,' would never comb smoothly back with the rest of Jane Frior's hair, but always kept springing forward and swinging across a corner of her forehead, disturbing the orderly arrangement of her head. As yet, there was not a faded hue or a haggard line in the face. Such would be long in steal ing away the vigorous prime of an earnest, calm nature, strong in itself, amply supplied with interests which were largely impersonal, and with honourable work which was its own reward. Miss Gray was clad fittingly in grey \u2014 one of the colours made for her. Competent critics on old masterpieces of art have often expressed the effect graphically. Grey toned down and"], [132, "BURIED DIAMONDS 120 brought out her carnations in the most mas terly manner. It is not every woman whom grey becomes, as it is not every woman who, even when young, looks well before breakfast. It is not a bad sign when she stands the last test. Miss Gray surmounted it as trium phantly as Jane Prior did. Jane was a fine looking girl ; Miss Gray was more, she verged on a beautiful young woman. It was not merely her handsome features and rosy bloom which led to this conclusion ; her face was sweet with heart and bright with mind. The three small Woods sat solemnly in a row at one of the desks in the old-fashioned, slightly-battered schoolroom. The children were like culprits about to be presented to their executioner. Yet they were neither badly endowed nor badly disposed. True, httle Alice, all over pink in her confusion, was apt to be desperately engrossed with dolls. But lint-topped Tom was a boy of quite average understanding, as exhibited in his habits. He"], [133, "A TUG OF WAR AND A FLAG OF TRUCE 121 had only to be taken and examined on the contents of the innumerable boxes \u2014 ranging from pill to band-boxes \u2014 \u25a0which were the desire of his heart at the present stage of his existence. Any liberal-minded examiner would be satisfied with the result. In these boxes Tom bestowed shoals of extraordinary and improving curiosi ties in the shape of new farthings, old postage stamps, little stones, bits of wood of which the carving was very rude indeed, leaves of plants, dead or dying beetles and worms. And anybody might have put dumpling faced Sam through his ' facings ' after he had trotted out surreptitiously and been brought back summarily from the offices, where he had been contemplating the cattle feeding or the horses airing, or even when he had been fired with noble emulation by the sight of the pantry boy weeding the garden beds or cleaning the knives.

The children's copy-books, &c, were laid out for inspection, while the embryo scholars manifestly shook in their shoes before the verdict to be pronounced on their halting performance. ' Everything does you all great credit,' murmured Miss Gray, with a comprehensive wave of her hand and a comical glance at Jane Prior, which the giver of the glance hoped the rigid disciplinarian appreciated. But some criticism was necessary, and the newcomer pounced upon Alice's signature. ' Don't you think it might be a little more distinct, Ally?

' We have a puppy \u2014 at least Tartar has, and its name is Benny,' Sam's treble voice broke in, without much relevance, and with an inde corous laugh. He drew down an indignant glance from Jane's steel-blue eyes. Then the children hustled themselves down from their bench aud disappeared in a twinkling. ' Is this your old schoolroom ? ' inquired Miss Gray, wistfully, as she looked round. There were discoloured maps on the walls, aud chipped globes in one corner. The book-cases were full of shabby books, which had seen much wear aud tear. There was the cottage piano with the yellowing keys, on which endless scales had been strummed, and poor Miss Rossiter had displayed her bravura execution to marvelling little musical aspirants. And there was the table in the middle of the room, round which short legs had dangled"], [137, "n i t/G OF WAR AND A FLAG OF TRUCE 125 from uneasy cane chairs, while chubby hands had been busy obliterating sums from mal treated slates, or scattering ink freely around as the stiff fingers, reluctantly obeying per plexed brains, travelled painfully across the pages of exercise books. ' Would you mind telling me about it and letting me see where you sat and what you did ? ' petitioned the new governess with some thing of a beseeching tone coming into her voice. ' Oh, if you like,' answered Jane, carelessly, but with a shade of surprise and discomfiture. The manner of the questioner was enough to suggest that she was but a tyro in her pro fession after all. If so, Jane had been singu larly misled. ' Yes, this was my old school room, but I did not get much good here, though there was nobody to blame. There was nothing done here that could serve as a precedent or example.' 1 Was it only your schoolroom ? ' persisted"], [138, "126 BURIED DIAMONDS Miss Gray, unaware of the impression she was producing. 'No, of course not,' answered Jane promptly. ' Susie (Mrs. Crabtree) and Alice (the children's mother), and even Jack (my brother), before he went to a boys' school, were all taught here. Later Jack and I read here for a whole year with Mr. Conyngham.' Jane brightened at the recollection. ' That was better \u2014 I learned something then. I beheve my mind began to open. Mr. Conyng ham was quite an able man, I used to enjoy his explanations. I was so proud of his saying that it was a pleasure to make them to one who could follow him.' Jane held up her head, and looked her best at the recollection. ' I was fond of Greek from the first. It was all very nice, though, to be sure, there was the difficulty with Jack (my brother). He had some taste for mathematics, but he hated classics, which my father wished him to master. He used to sit there,' pointing to a corner, ' over his con-"], [139, "A TUG OF WAR AND A FLAG OB TRUCE 127 slruing, and when he was supposed to have been occupied with it for an hour, he would suddenly look up and ask Mr. Conyngham if he had read some story my mother had got from Mudie's, or if he did not think the weather fine for fishing ? ' ' Oh ! ' Miss Gray responded with a long drawn breath to the account of the delinquen cies of the young squire of Redcot, while her lips parted with a wavering smile, and her hazel eyes dwelt for a considerable space, as if they liked to rest on the particular corner. To be sure it was the corner on which the light came from the western window chequered by the bare boughs of a hedge maple that grew out side. It suggested vividly how the small leaves that would flutter in every breath of wind must make a rhythmic dance of light and shade on the faded carpet in summer. The same window commanded a side view, through the shrubbery, of the grey barn beloved of the bats, and the disused ivy-grown threshing-mill haunted by"], [140, "BURIED DIAMONDS 128 the owls. It might have been remarked after wards that Miss Gray always chose that corner, though it was the farthest from the fire, for her teacher's presidential chair. After breakfast, Jane was once more aggrieved by the children's arriving for the duties of the day, cumbered with their own affairs. Tom had one of his boxes lined with turkey's feathers which he had picked up, Sam was panting to recount his encounter with the turkey which had shed the feathers, and Alice had taken it upon her to bring in the last of her dolls. That came of being too easy and familiar with the children. 8 Let them unload their burdened little bodies and minds,' said Miss Gray. ' It need not be altogether without profit, you know ' \u2014 she added waggishly, not without a quick glance at Jane to see if the most distant approach to raillery might be allowable \u2014 ' admit information at every pore. Come, Tom and Sam, and tell me"], [141, "A TUG OF WAR AND A FLAG OF TRUCE 129 all about the turkey and its wings, and whether calves and lambs have wings too.' Tom and Sam shouted with derisive lau^h ter over the idea, but were incited to listen when Miss Gray delivered the least pedantic of lectures which took only one minute in the de livery upon Alice's doll's eyes and ears and fingers and toes. ' But we'll not use such a liberty with your baby again, dear,' the lecturer promised the child. ' How would grown-up people hke to have themselves or their babies treated as sub jects for dissection ? ' ' She is not a baby,' objected Alice indig nantly ; ' she is Anna Maria Constance \u2014 a lady going to a ball. Don't you see her fan and her bouquet ? I am to be dressed hke that when I go out to India to papa.' ' I beg Anna Maria Constance's pardon,' said Miss Gray. ' But whether your doll is a baby or a lady she is for you to take care of, play with, and dress. She is not for another person vol. 1. K"], [142, "BURIED DIAMONDS 130 to dissect. Has she a great stock of clothes, Ally ? I think I may be able to help you to make her something new.

I have a hat in my eye to be trimmed with one of Tom's turkey's feathers, if he will be generous and present one to Anna Maria Constance, which will just suit her.' \"When lessons did come on, Jane had her reward at last. She had lingered, puzzled and on the verge of being vexed, for, in spite of her big brains, she was a woman slow to receive a new idea or to alter a foregone conclusion. But she admitted candidly, with honest satisfaction, that nothing could be better or more thorough than Miss Gray's mode of teaching. She had not been to the College of Preceptresses and passed her examinations in vain, and she was perfectly resolute in exacting all the children could <rive her. It was soon plain that, while she would not hear of long hours of lessons for such young"], [143, "A TUG OF WAR AND A FLAG OF TRUCE 131 chUdren, there woidd be as httle as possible of shirking or trifling, where business was con cerned, in her reign. Jane Prior submitted to the new order of things, but not without a recoil. She was not arrogant or domineering by nature, and she had wisely determined to support Miss Gray's au thority. At the same time Jane was tempted to suspect that Miss Gray might be very clever \u2014 that went without saying ; and might know her work \u2014 that was even more undeniable ; yet she was fond of theories, and liked short tasks and changes for herself as well as for the chil dren. She rambled all over the place, and she found out the walks, even the winding path hidden among the tall shrubs to the rose garden \u2014 bare enough at this season \u2014 as if by intui tion. It almost seemed as if she had known Redcot in a previous state of existence, and was dehghted to get back to it and had its familiar beauties. Jane did not accuse her Admirable Crichton K 2"], [144, "BURIED DIAMONDS 132 of unfaithfulness to her post, only it was hard to find anybody, teachers included, faultless. Miss Prior was young, and had a craving after perfection \u2014 she felt a shade of disappointment. In place of approaching nearer to Miss Gray, the young lady drew slightly away from the schoolmistress, and engrossed herself with her own pursuits. Then a special incident occurred in the family life. John Prior was summoned to be on the Grand Jury at the Winter Assize in the county town, and, whatever his pressing interests at home, he must fulfil his obligations to his fellow-subjects. The same thing had not hap pened for a period of years. The last time it had come about there had been an understand ing that when next Mr. Prior was on the jury, Mrs. Prior, who even then visited rarely, should accompany her husband, and be the guest of some old friends while the Assize lasted. Much had altered since that arrangement was entered into; but John Prior had not forgotten it, and"], [145, "A TUG OF WAR AND A FLAG OF TRUCE 133 his wife was touched and pleased by his remem brance. Altogether the two appeared to soften to each other, and come closer together on this small point. In the very details of their setting out \u2014 in her wish to drive with him on a doubt fid day in the ramshackle phaeton instead of having a close carriage sent out from Newton for her private accommodation, in his anxietv about her wraps and parcels \u2014 Miss Gray, a keenly-interested onlooker, felt she got a passing glimpse through the man's gruffness and the woman's reserve of what the relations between them had been in happier years. Jane Prior and Bennet Gray were left be hind at Redcot to keep house, take care of the children, and follow their own devices. Jane immediately improved the occasion by resolving to get through a large amount of ' stiff' reading which was on her mind. She had received a loan some time ago of several valuable and ' heavy ' books, which ought to be returned on the first opportunity. She would"], [146, "BURIED DIAMC: r - 134 take advantage of her father and mother's ab sence, at a season when visitors were out of count in the country, to shut herself up and have a good time of hard study, such as she had not enjoved for many months, and be able to send back the volumes in question without further delav. Whether Jane had grown a httle rusty in her enforced neglect of anything hke tough reading ; whether the old ethics were a more indigestible morsel than she had reckoned, she found at the end of the first day that if she were to do as she had planned she must husband every moment of her time. Never mind, she felt free to do it, now that Miss Gray had com mand of the children. Jane Prior forthwith sent a polite me;- _. to Miss Gray, and begged thar she woidd excuse her (Jane) from coming down to dinner.

However, when she encountered Jane in the course of the afternoon hurrying out of her room in her garden hat and over-shoes, with a generally distrait air, just for five minutes of fresh air, as she rushed up and down the avenue, to keep herself from getting inconveniently sleepy later in the day. the voung teacher stopped the young student with an eager appeal, ' I shall not detain you above one moment, Miss Prior ; but is it worth while having all the ceremony and trouble of a late dinner for me? \u2014 unless, indeed."], [148, "BURIED DIAMONDS 136 dinner is a solemn institution which cannot be set aside.'

' I am not going to starve you because I do not choose to eat myself.' ' But it is not starving,' urged Bennet. ' I have been accustomed to dine early. I really eat my dinner at lunch time. Governesses are frequently expected to do that whether they like it or not ; but I like it. Even if I did not, a bit of fish would suit me too, splendidly. I have often dined on less when I snatched a scrambling meal at a restaurant. All the time I was at Boughton,' naming her college, ' I breakfasted on bread and milk \u2014 and it did taste so good at half-past five.'

' Yes,' said Miss Gray, 8 you know I had to crib the time for reading from every odd minute, and so had a friend of mine, since we were both teaching junior classes all the time. We had to reduce our nights to three or four hours. Mary Burton could stand it and keep awake, but I used to get so sleepy over my lexicon, and even during the lectures, I was ashamed of myself. Still it was jolly,' with a sigh of remembrance over past pleasures. ' What did you do to keep the sleep off? ' inquired Jane, from a selfish motive. ' Come into my room for five minutes \u2014 I beheve it is going to rain \u2014 and tell me all about it ; what books you had to post yourself up in for your examinations, and how you came out of them.'

She was in ear nest in all she did. She had given her heart to the passion, and anything which interfered with it at this period of her life simply ' bothered ' her, as she put it. Bennet walked up to the bookcase and examined its contents with the intelligent relish of one who was something of a student on her own account, though the books were not those she had sought specially to master. On com paring notes, the two discovered that Jane's bent was more to philosophy, ancient and modern, and to natural science, while Miss Gray's was to history and literature in all ages. Jane was not altogether sorry, and Bennet positively rejoiced, though not for herself, that each evidently excelled the other in her own department. In the excitement of the moment Jane confided to her companion that she (Jane) had"], [151, "A TUG OF WAR AND A FLAG OF TRUCE 139 an ambition to go up to Oxford and pass an examination there, and Miss Gray reciprocated the confidence by an admission that she would hke that very much for herself if the thing could be conveniently managed, of which Jane in her generosity had no doubt. Thereupon the candidates for honours \u2014 such honours as they could win \u2014 settled the different subjects they would take, advised each other on the books they ought to consult, and became so friendly that at last the women in them fairly unbent. Inductive and deductive systems, postulates, cellular chords were gradually dropped, together with battles on Thracian and Etruscan plains, Courts of Areopagus, Conscript Fathers, odes, and orations. The citers of these formidable topics descended to gossiping and laughing about their several experiences, professors, and fellow-students. The speakers told with gusto of lucky hits and ludicrous mistakes, giving the slight but graphic local and personal touches that had reference to a"], [152, "BURIED DIAMONDS 140 college hall or a savant's face, in which women excel. These young women had not sport to diverge to, as two young men would have had in similar circumstances, though Miss Gray did try to edge in a word for lawn tennis, and, more extraordinary still, for dancing. Jane did not follow up these suggestions, but the couple had a taste in common for nature and for long walks, which did almost as well as boating, cricketing, or hunting, for a diversion from more serious subjects. To begin with, and in the main, however, it was learning on which these girls, each with a good head of her own, fraternised. The medium has become possible in recent years, and it seems to serve as well on a pinch as ball dresses, choral practising, or district visiting. The sympathy aroused was a pleasure to Bennet Gray for special reasons, but she had not been unaccustomed to such sympathy. With Jane Prior it was different. She had"], [153, "A TUG OF WAR AND A FLAG OF TRUCE 141 been far more alone in tastes which were not shared by the women of her particular circle. She had not known such communion since she had left her school, or since the days when she had read along with Jack, and the teaching of the Cambridge coach had been a positive enchantment, under the influence of which her mind had brightened indescribably. She was ready to swear friendship with Miss Gray, to trust her implicitly, even though they should differ a little on the education of the children or on any other question that might crop up. She came near to forming a league with her on the spot, which was a long way for a woman of Jane Prior's temperament to go on so short an acquaintance. For the rest of the time of Mr. and Mrs. Prior's absence, the ardent young souls agreed to set the forms of society at defiance, and enjoy themselves in their own way. They had no family breakfast, and no ceremonious dinner. They ate and drank such primitive fare as"], [154, "BURIED DIAMONDS 142 bread and milk in their own rooms at unheard of hours in the morning. The girls met and dined at luncheon, and consented to relax and refresh themselves \u2014 say with the wisdom of Socrates, or the quips of the ' Birds ' of Aris tophanes \u2014 over afternoon tea. These sources of relaxation on such lips did fit in queerly with the soulless splendour of the glassy mirrors, the gilt-legged tables, and the floral hearth-rug of the last Georgian and William era. The day was wound up with something equivalent to sporting oaks and solitary ' sap ping ' after slices of fish or wings of partridge, or something equally substantial. The two delinquents kept their own counsel outside the house, but inside the cook and the housemaid were to be met and vanquished. These functionaries, with a greatness of soul which showed itself in utter indifference to the trouble they were spared, felt outraged by the unheard-of proceedings of 'them un accountable young ladies.' They were not"], [155, "A TUG OF WAR AND A FLAG OF TRUCE 143 exacting or hard or flighty or worse, and still they were no more like what young ladies were wont to be, and ought to be, than if they had been all that and a great deal more into the bargain. Yet, in spite of converting her self into a miserable book-worm, sitting up of nights and neglecting good victuals, Miss Prior was well enough to look at, though not to be mentioned in the same breath with beautiful Miss Susie that was, who had never been done with her gay doings. And as for that there governess young lady Miss Prior chose to make so much of, as was doubtless at the bottom of the mischief, since it belonged to her poor trade, she might have been a regular stunner, and turned the heads of half the gentlemen who came near her if she had liked, in place of frightening them away with her books.

When the heads of the house resumed tbe reins at Redcot, the family fell back into its normal condition, even to the renewal of the alienation partially dissolved between John Prior and his wife. The couple slipped again sadly, but as it were inevitably into their former attitude. But the friendship between Jane Prior and Miss Gray continued. None rejoiced with greater sincerity at the alliance than did Mrs. Prior, though it shut her up still more to her book, her needlework, and Tommy \u2014 the old blue Skye terrier. She would look up with shining eyes at the two girls standing exchanging endless last words over"], [157, "AN OLD WOMAN'S FAVOUR 145 the fire or in the doorway. Miss Gray's heart ached for the woman left out in the cold \u2014 an experience which Mrs. Prior was too magnani mous and self-forgetful to resent for herself. Her own daughter was too well accustomed to it, too inobservant otherwise, too absorbed in the grand mental gains which lay before her \u2014 for intellectual ambition, no less than the pursuit of pleasure, has its unconscious devour ing selfishness \u2014 to notice her mother's isolation. Bennet Gray sought by the deepest, most weU-laid strategy, to court the friendship of the mistress of the house. The enterprise was not easy, in spite of Mrs. Prior's gentleness \u2014 she was shy and proud and humble all in one. She could not help looking with distrustful eyes on the beautiful, clever young woman \u2014 solid enough to satisfy Jane, brilliant enough, even in the comparative shadow of her governess's position, to cause John Prior in his pre-occupa tion and discontent to look up and listen to her remarks with a gleam of entertainment. Why vol. I. L"], [158, "BURIED DIAMONDS 146 should such an one come to Mrs. Prior ? She had nothing to give beyond the courteous consideration she had never withheld in the old days from Miss Rossiter, and the admiration she had freely bestowed on this stranger. Miss Gray had a great deal that was worth having in life, probably about as much \u2014 seeing that the public estimate of a governesa's career is undergoing a great change, and that she looked a reasonable, happy-tempered girl \u2014 as she cared for. Why need Miss Gray seek an increase of her well-being from Mrs. Prior, who was not herself so much at ease or so richly endowed, though she refused to complain, that she was qualified to shower benefits on all around her ? Mrs. Prior knew in the depth of her heart that for the present, at least, she had lost nearly all that she most prized which had once belonged to her, and, in the belonging, made her passing rich. Husband, daughters, even her son \u2014 her only son Jack \u2014 who had not grown away from her, was gone for the time"], [159, "AN OLD WOMAN'S FAVOUR 147 to the ends of the earth, across leagues of land and sea, into unknown regions, amidst un dreamt-of dangers, and the wife and mother was angrily or calmly relegated to her books, her needlework, and Tommy ! What had Mrs. Prior to give to Miss Gray ? What had the elder woman to do comforting and petting the younger ? But one afternoon, after luncheon was over, Miss Gray, instead of retiring to the school room or her own room and her learned associ ations like Jane, instead of setting out alone or with her friend on one of the long walks to which they were given, came creeping into the drawing-room with a pitiful story of bad tooth ache, amply corroborated by heavy eyes and a flushed and swollen face. She begged a loan of one of Mrs. Prior's perennial stock of novels, to keep her from dwelling on the pain she was suffering. The woman addressed felt at once the touch of nature which makes the whole world kin, L 2"], [160, "BURIED DIAMONDS 148 and responded readily to the human cry. ' Oh ! poor thing ; I beg your pardon, Miss Gray, but I am so sorry. I need not speak of a dentist, for there is none nearer than Newton, to which you cannot go at a moment's notice ; and at the best, the tender mercies of a dentist are cruel. The only thing to do is to keep yourself warm, and perhaps the pain will go of itself before morning. I am afraid your room is draughty, though I sent up a screen. Will you spend the afternoon with me ? That is a cosy corner opposite ; you can lean back in the low chair, and you may drop off into a nice sleep. I shall not speak a wrord to disturb you.' 'You are too good,' protested the patient, willingly consenting to be installed into the comfortable chair on the other side of the hearth. ' But I am not so ill as that comes to.

' Not care ! \u2014 I ! ' exclaimed Bennet in such an energetic disclaimer that she forgot her ail ment, and started up bolt upright from her half- reclining posture, ' when I read the names of William Black's last novel, and Mrs. Oli phant's second last, as Miss Prior was taking the books from the book-box, and I have been dying to get a look at them ever since.' 'Dear me, Miss Gray, do you care for novels ? ' cried Mrs. Prior, opening her eyes. ' Care ! ' reiterated Bennet, ' I should think so. Care for \"Adam Bede,\" and \"Mary Barton,\" and \"Westward-Ho,\" and \" Nicholas Nickleby,\" and \" The Virginians,\" and \" Pride and Preju dice,\" and \" Waverley.\" I have sat up till two in the morning, and what is more, I have risen at six to read some of them.

Poor Alice married out of the schoolroom, I may say ; Susie went a great deal out into company ; and Jane is far beyond novels. I thought you were like Jane.' ' I am supposed to go in for history,' said Miss Gray, in an easy colloquial strain, which was enough to show that one pupil from the college of preceptresses wore her learning lightly, let us say nothing about gracefully. ' Did you never hear what was said by Lord Holland was it Lord Holland or Sir Robert Walpole ? \u2014 anyhow, it was a great statesman, when some body proposed to read history to him on his death-bed ? His answer was to the effect that he was sick of lies, let them read poetry to him. He might as well have said novels \u2014 good novels.' ' Well, I was brought up on Walter Scott"], [163, "AN OLD WOMAN'S FAVOUR 151 and Jane Austen, and I don't think there is much falsehood in them,' corroborated Mrs. Prior, with a deep sigh of satisfaction ; ' and I have got many a glimpse of real life that I should otherwise have missed \u2014 even out of authors little known and soon forgotten. When the children were young and my health was delicate I visited little \u2014 hardly more than I do now. Without novels I should have had small chance of change of scene and company. I was not strong enough, even if I had got the brains, to cope with heavier books ; and, though travels might have given me change of scene, and bio graphy introduced me to one other person and his immediate set, I should still have wanted the constant succession of fresh company. Mr. Prior was fond of travels, but he liked novels too in those days, and would read one out for half an evening, when I sat at work.' Her voice fell as she revived the peaceful picture, and she quickly obliterated it by another remini scence. ' I have read not only \" Evelina,\" and"], [164, "BURIED DIAMONDS 152 \"Cecilia,\" but the whole five volumes of \" Ca milla,\" ' she announced with innocent pride. ' It was a favourite book of ray mother's, and she used to quote it to me. I have read the original \" Sir Charles Grandison \" and \" Clarissa,\" with a little skipping. I have even dipped into an odd volume of the \" Fool of Quality.\" 8 Oh ! Mrs. Prior, say no more ; your novel lore is stupendous,' cried Bennet. And then, in spite of her toothache, the two fell to com paring notes on the couple's favourite stories and what were the tit-bits. The young woman and the old crossed the Rubicon by the bridge of romance, just as Jane and Bennet had passed it with the help of philosophy and the classics. The confabulation was renewed from day to day, when fresh volumes were exchanged. 'What is she doing now ? ' Mrs. Prior would be heard to inquire breathlessly with regard to a new and refractory heroine, into whose entrancing history Miss Gray, with her young eyes, had got before her fellow-reader by several chapters."], [165, "AN OLD WOMAN'S FAVOUR 153 ' Well, she has gone and misunderstood Sir Harry for the fourth time.

But that is no reason why she should take to philandering with the curate. I like that curate, though, immensely. The fact is, I'm deeply in love with him myself. If I had been Dorothy I'm sure I should have thrown over Sir Harry and married the Rev. Giles's flat feet and gawky laugh. I should have done it just because of the afternoon when he was caught sliding on the pond with all the bad boys in the parish. I should have sought to make up to him for the disgrace he got into when he sent the tickets for groceries and coals to the dreadful old pauper who shut the door in his face and his vicar's, and called names to them over the window.'"], [166, "BURIED DIAMONDS 154 'But you could not have been allowed to throw over poor Sir Harry, and you would certainly not have got the Rev. Giles,' objected the reader of long experience. ' He is reserved for reforming the Hon. Mary, who cares only for what is beautiful and graceful, and is so vindictive that she has kept up a silly school girl feud with a lady who has become her sister-in-law.' The chat grew more and more a matter of course, until Mrs. Prior's tongue would wag the faster of the two. It was a winning tongue, that could express thick-coming fancies, quick turns of thought, even merry jests \u2014 all dashed with the latent enthusiasm which was so strong a feature in the woman, though the tongue shrank into silence before a little coolness, harshness, rudeness. 'You have got into my mother's good graces,' said Jane Prior to Miss Gray, without a particle of jealousy.

And immediately the speaker did him the further wrong of appearing caught and put out. At last Bennet ventured to ask to see Mrs. Prior's needlework, and Mrs. Prior did not mind showing it to her. The mistress of Red cot explained that she had been engaged for a number of years on quilts for each of her chdd ren. She worked slowly, but she hoped to finish before her eyes failed her. ' The work is old-fashioned and of no account compared to the fine artistic embroidery we see nowadays,' she said, in her modest, deprecating way ; 8 but, apart from the value, I think the children may like to have it one day,' she explained, and"], [168, "BURIED DIAMONDS 156 there was a soft, far-away look in her eyes which did not leave it doubtful as to what change of circumstances the 8 one day ' referred. ' And after the children,' she added cheerfully, ' I daresay Ally and Molly and the boys will not object to having some remembrance of their granny if only to prove that her stupid old fingers were not always idle, though she read novels by the hundred, and sermons by the score.' ' And sometimes found the novel the better sermon of the two,' put in Bennet. ' Sometimes,' admitted Mrs. Prior, ' but each is good in its own way.' The work was minute and elaborate. There was neither bold drawing, nor striking effect, nor learned conventionality. There was a nearer, though still a distant, approach to ex quisiteness of detad, marred by a certain timi dity and hesitation belonging to deficient artis tic knowledge and training and to comparative ignorance, both with regard to the result to be"], [169, "AN OLD U VMAN'S FAVOUR 157 arrived at, and the limit of what could be attained with the materials employed.

But to see the qudts as Mrs. Prior saw them and yet was aware that none save one person had ever caught a glimpse of them would have been to have borrowed her imagination.

' Oh, I know there is nothing to be seen,' cried Mrs. Prior, with a despairing sense that there was nobody there, save herself, with eyes to see anything in her labour of love, except poor, pottering work. ' I know that even I could make a great deal more of poppies or foxgloves, for instance, than of those small obscure things \u2014 too insignificant for art to borrow. But I have a great liking for them, I daresay because they have been seldom copied, and so the most faulty copies bring back the originals more vividly to my mind. I am aware that an artist with her needle can cause a single sunflower or a spray of clematis to be a thou sand times more imposing and picturesque, with a thousand times less trouble, than all my heap of trivialities.' ' I like your flowers best, Mrs. Prior,' said Miss Gray emphatically. ' It is very good of you to say so,' said the"], [171, "AN OLD WOMAN'S FAVOUR 159 complimented worker, shaking her head. ' But I am not so conceited as to think my work is at all admirable in that sense, or what many people would care for.

Mrs. Prior was \u2014 as everybody in the house hold, from her husband to the last pert table maid was ready to protest \u2014 a slave to that horrid old dog, Tommy.

But Mrs. Prior, who never wearied of any thing or anybody, and never forgot where she had once loved, continued staunch and faithful to Tommy, all the more so because others were unfaithful.

It was a hardship to wash him when he struggled, splashed the washer, and showed his few teeth. His begging was no longer a pretty accomplishment, but an intrusive piece of greedy importunity.

His scratching, which that earlier world had carelessly or magnani-"], [177, "TOMMY'S NEW FRIEND 165 mously overlooked, had waxed horribly sug gestive. Then Mrs. Prior's heart grew sore. Her sense of justice was outraged. How could Tommy know that there was such an alteration in the sentiments of his judges, and why was he to be punished for their fickleness and peevish ness? Her tenderness was wounded. The very things which rendered Tommy no longer acceptable to his other cronies appealed irre sistibly to her generosity and softness of heart.

She seemed to recognise a certain similarity between her position and that of Tommy. She was not without a sorrowful fellow-feeling where he was concerned. Bennet Gray could catch words and sentences of long, one-sided conversations which Tommy's mistress held with him when they were alone. She would remind him of a hundred pleasant old haunts, games, family festivals the two had shared. 'Do you remember the rabbits in Redcot quarry, and the rats in the barn, Tommy ?

The last outcry was from Susie, whose universal pleasantness was not equal to the derangement of the grace of her entrance, and the onslaught on her elegant clothes. Mrs. Prior would wince at the protests as if they had been uttered against herself, would entice Tommy back to his comfortable corner, and secretly pat him to make up for that sudden collapse in his elated bearing which proved the repulse had somehow reached a vulnerable spot in his canine heart. 8 You only wanted to tell them you were glad they had come back, poor old Tommy !

Never mind, you are your old mistress's pet : come and welcome her, and she will not drive you off' There was another person who did not drive Tommy off, to the vague surprise of every body, Mrs. Prior included. Miss Gray, that charming, reasonable, highly-informed young woman, instructress of youth, and friend of Jane Prior, displayed \u2014 not nervous terror, which some learned and clever people, other wise invulnerable, have betrayed with regard to dogs and cats \u2014 but childish exultation when Tommy condescended to put her down on his list of friends, and began to persecute her with his attentions. 8 Tommy has run to the drawing-room door to meet me \u2014 be has, indeed.' 8 He has leaped up almost to the crown of my head.' 8 Look \u2014 look \u2014 he is ] lulling me in by the hem of my gown, the kind darling.

She applauded his begging"], [182, "BURIED DIAMONDS 170 more ecstatically than Mrs. Prior herself com mended his extraordinary feats in this respect ; for Tommy could still sit up for five minutes at a time, as if he had swallowed a ramrod, looking more like the British Grenadier than the genuine article looked. Miss Gray was constantly caught surreptitiously rewarding the performance with choice morsels from her plate. Tommy was in the habit of exhibiting other engaging attributes in which, to tell the truth, there was more of childlike confidence in his friends' indulgence than of doglike humility, or of a modest, retiring disposition. He would plant his two shaggy front paws one on each foot of a shivering individual toast ing his or her toes on the fender. He would look up with calm affectionate assurance amounting to sublime nonchalance in the writhing face of the unfortunate sufferer \u2014 of whose crushed toes, Tommy, with his by no means light weight, was ruthlessly making a"], [183, "TOMMY'S NEW FRIEND 171 soft cushion for the sensitive soles of his own paws. At another time he would have a cunning eye to the footstool with which some luxurious creature was supplementing his or her general well-being. He would pertinaciously watch his opportunity, never forgetting the main chance, for a period of hours. He would deliberately insinuate first one paw and then another on the coveted stool, and try, by an insidious appeal to human feelings, or by bodily pressure in a slow, shoving process, to remove the owner's feet, and to establish in their place his fat body. At last, if the grudged possessor of the bone of contention unwarily rose for a second, then, quick as thought, the last rem- nant of Tommy's alertness was displayed in seizing on the goal of his ambition, which was frequently far too small for his require ments. He had to poise himself upon it uneasily, with all his superfluous bulk quiver ing for lack of sufficient support, or to stretch"], [184, "BURIED DIAMONDS 172 himself with his head hanging overboard \u2014 so that the blood ought to have rushed to his obstinate head \u2014 while his hind legs dangled helplessly in the opposite direction. Miss Gray could never see that these were scandalous liberties on Tommy's part. She laughed till the tears came into her eyes, she endured without a murmur \u2014 even proudly welcomed excruciating torture when her feet happened to be those on which Tommy threw his solid weight in improvising cushions upon the fender. She promptly resigned her foot stool for his use, as if she was only too happy to serve him. She might have been a child with her first pet. Jane, who had her own inclination to hero-worship, and had begun to worship Miss Gray, was forced to own to her self that her new friend, with her natural endowments and college training, could be positively silly on some points \u2014 to wit, her behaviour to dogs. It was a proof of that want of absolute perfection in anybody, even"], [185, "TOMMY'S NEW FRIEND 173 in a scholarly woman, which Jane detected with regret. But one thing was certain, and it was a comfort to know it \u2014 Miss Gray was not at all in the position of an old cowed dependent and toast-eater, who was lament ably deficient in the attainments she professed to impart, and so was forced to ingratiate herself with the very animals of the family. Bennet Gray was a highly-gifted, elaborately equipped young woman, independent and responsible in her calling, with an acknow ledged position and rights which nobody would dream of invading. Times have changed for the better with the Bennet Grays of society, even within the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Miss Gray's penchant for Tommy, hke her great liking for Tommy's mistress, was gratuitous and beyond suspicion. If the saying, 8Love me, love my dog,' contains any truth, there is a corresponding saying at least as influential in some instances"], [186, "BURIED DIAMONDS 174 \u2014 ' Love my dog, and I'll love you.' Mrs. Prior and Bennet Gray had anived at such an advanced stage of friendship that the former would, without being asked or led up to the subject, begin three out of every four of their conversations with the prelude \u2014 ' Miss Gray, you have heard of my son who has taken a voyage to Australia ? Poor boy ! he is far from home and among novel surroundings, but I am sure he has not forgotten his mother.' Then would follow an anecdote of Jack's youth or maturity. There was an exhaustless stock of similar stories, extending from his childhood, through his school-days, to his present man hood. The tales were an excuse for long lists of his good qualities, tastes, and habits. Neither were the visions which had once been entertained of his future entirely left out. A gallant fight was made for them, though there were signs that the old dreams were fading under the burden of disappoint ment, doubt, and apprehension, which even the"], [187, "TOMMY'S NEW FRIEND 175 fondest and most faithful heart could not refuse to own. Miss Gray listened with endless patience, nay, with keenest interest in the shining eyes, which she instinctively cast down, so tell-tale was their light. These confidences were a strong indication of Mrs. Prior's deepening regard for her young ally. They were also some relief to the elder woman, since the young man's name was rarely mentioned in his family. John Prior had turned against his sou, and Jane had gone with her father in the dispute. As for Susie and Lambert Crabtree, they were like Gallio ; they cared for none of these things. It would not matter to them though her father quarrelled with Jack beyond the possibility of reconcilia tion. The estate of Redcot was entailed on male heirs, and there was no likelihood of the entads being broken. For anything farther the Priors \u2014 father and son\u2014 could manage their own affairs, including the discord between"], [188, "BURIED DIAMONDS 176 them. It was, strictly speaking, no business of the Crabtrees', especially as Susie had not the slightest intention of quarrelling with either of the disputants. She would show the world that she could be on good terms with both. Did she not like to stand well with everybody? One day a letter came to Mrs. Prior from her son, full of all the colonial wonders and news about himself which he thought would interest her. The letter arrived with the morning's post, and Mr. Prior took it out of the bag at break fast time. He knew the handwriting before he glanced at the post mark, and he handed the letter to his wife without remark. But his wide nostrils involuntarily expanded and con tracted, there was a nervous twitch of his full under-lip, and the furrow between his shaggy, straggling brows was ploughed still deeper. Mrs. Prior coloured up with mingled pleasure and indignation, and put the letter"], [189, "TOMMY'S NEW FRIEND 177 in her pocket without tearing open the envelope. ' She cannot open it before me,' John Prior said to himself ; ' she has not the face to do it. It contains too much that is not fit to be read in my presence. Her precious son is asking her for money or abusing us all round, and her face would betray her. She could not suppress that evidence.' ' I will not read it before him,' Mrs. Prior told herself as she drank her tea with her hand shaking so much that she could hardly hold the cup. ' His own father ! and not to ask if the boy is well, or if he writes of coming home \u2014 as if he had done anything really wrong \u2014 as if he had been a scapegrace like Ned Owen ! Jack was only not very diligent over his books and a little extravagant. It was pardonable enough in a lad \u2014 hundreds at Oxford do the same. It is too bad in his father.' Neither did Jane Prior put any question. vol. I. n"], [190, "178 BURIED DIAMONDS She did care to hear what her brother was doing, though not to a tithe of the extent that his mother cared. But she was silent on principle, as Jane did many things that had, perhaps, better been trusted to the impulse of the moment than to principle. Mrs. Prior was not naturally a tacitun* woman ; she had womanly reserve and pru dence, but sympathy was also very dear to her. When it was denied to her from legitimate sources, she was fain to quench her thirst at the irregular spring which had sprung up for her in the desert of her life. The next time she caught Bennet Gray alone, Mrs. Prior, as if to indemnify herself for the privation she was subjected to, and to revenge herself on those who ought to have cared, and did not care, to hear her letter, poured forth her information. She boasted with innocent mother-boasting of Jack's ex ploits. He had been at one of the diggings. He had spent three days in the bush camping"], [191, "TOMMY'S NEW FRIEND 179 out. He had seen no end of opossums. His correspondent enlarged with quickly-roused admiration upon his sensible views and judi cious intentions. Miss Gray was a good listener here also, and did not fail to satisfy the eager speaker. But when Bennet was shut into her room she covered her face with her hands to hide her scarlet cheeks. ' I could beat myself,' she groaned, ' I feel such a hypocrite. What will she think when she knows ? Will even Jack be able to forgive me when it all comes to his ears ? Shall I ever forgive myself? ' Then she drew from her pocket a thick letter and sht open an outer envelope. The letter enclosed was marvellously like that from which she had just heard various details. Indeed, the cleverest expert would have been puzzled to detect a difference in the hand writing, and the Sydney postmark was the same, though Mss Gray's letter had come to her under an English cover, addressed by a N 2"], [192, "180 BURIED DIAMONDS woman's hand, and bearing the stamp of one of the midland towns. Bennet pored over the pages, and seemed to forget her contrition to the extent of being disgracefully triumphant, because they con tained projects revealed to her alone. ' He does not tell his mother of his inquiries into the price of land and of his going to see different lots, or of his reckoning as to how fast a log house could be run up. What would she say if she were told that it was I who sent her son so far away from her and everybody ! ' Miss Gray rose in her excitement, and began to walk up and down the room, and to speak half- aloud, as if she were pleading her cause against an invisible accuser. ' Oh ! dear Mrs. Prior, I could not help it. There was no other way then. I was forced to see, for his sake as well as my own, whether he was in earnest, whether he coidd give up things \u2014 his friends among them. I had not learned to know you, and I did not wish to go where I should never"], [193, "TOMMY'S NEW FRIEND 181 be wanted, and to take what would always be grudged to me. Besides, I saw enough and heard enough, from himself, to be aware that he had other friends \u2014 companions rather, idle, rich, and inconsiderate \u2014 not generous like him, who were no good, and among whom he would never do good. I had to make myself certain that he could renounce his past, begin anew, and live and work in earnest for himself and me. There was no other way then ; it would have been our only chance, and I had to put it before him, because, though I was no older, I had known another side of life. I seemed called on to decide for both.' She sat down again and studied the letter once more, giving herself up to happier ideas. ' There is no need now, dear, rash, impul sive Jack,' she told another than Mrs. Prior in accents of exultation instead of pleading, 8 for exile and toil, on borrowed money too \u2014 none in the world, thank God for it, for your sake,"], [194, "BURIED DIAMONDS 182 and mine, and hers ; and oh ! surely some day for your poor father's.' There was no end to the reflections which that letter produced. The next thing Miss Gray did was to take a packet of thin paper from her desk and contemplate it lovingly \u2014 deprecatingly. ' I shall have to answer as soon as possible, of course, and what a letter I have got to write now that. I have received an address ! You have been better off than I in that respect, sir. You had Mary Burton's address to write to in case I quitted Berkshire. That quitting was rather different from anything we had thought of. It was sudden, but it was not at all dis agreeable. I had the luxury of the best cab from the station all to myself. I could take my entire luggage, and I had no trouble either about the weight or anything else, for not only was I a first-class passenger, Mr. Joliffe, good man ! though he had sometimes treated me cavalierly enough, insisted on being at the"], [195, "TOMMY'S NEW FRIEND 183 station to see me off, as if I could no longer take care of myself. I wonder if anybody ever had half so much to say before in a letter as I have t:> write to Jack,' speculated Miss Gray, leaning forward on her crossed arms, and not knowing where to begin, from sheer embarras de richesses. ' He will be surprised until he has no surprise left to feel, though the sky were to topple over on his head. It will be so strange for him to know that I am here, and so curious for him to read my first impressions and he far away, if he is not angry with me for coming. But he can see that when Jane's letter of inquiry was forwarded to me, the temptation was irresistible, especially when I had nothing else to do, and when I owed some thing to myself and to the friends I had,' she meditated pensively, and raising her head with a little air of pride, ' I mean I was bound to satisfy Mary Burton and her father, that my first step was not to throw myself and all the rest of it away without making a single invest!-"], [196, "184 BURIED DIAMONDS gation. So much for your not having been always the wisest of men, poor, dear Jack,' she broke off with a rueful shake of the head ; ' and for exposing yourself to the necessity of probation by way of punishment. But you were good, true-hearted, uncalculating,' she told herself more warmly than ever, ' when you gave me as manly and honest a heart as ever beat.

Unquestionably Bennet Gray's private cogi-"], [197, "TOMMY'S NEW FRIEND 185 tations bore an alarming resemblance to those of the syren adventuresses of fiction, of whom we wot. But these alluring heroines have not, as a rule, passed through colleges of pre ceptresses, surmounted stiff examinations, aud aspired to university honours. They have in general been the offspring of purported cre dulous advertisements, or replies to the same in Metropolitan newspapers, and of a confiding willingness to dispense with all references. Neither have the enchantresses been dis tinguished, as a rule, by their respectful affection for elderly ladies, and foolish fondness for superannuated dogs. In the end, of the two letters which were all that went from Redcot, addressed to Jack Prior, entrusted to the mercies of the next colonial mail, the one was written by his mother and the other by his sister. Jane thawed enough to be induced to ascertain where Jack was and what he was doing, as a prelude to sending him \u2014 not all the news of"], [198, "186 BURIED DIAMONDS the neighbourhood \u2014 her mother would do that, but a slightly high and dry, though not unkind, missive.

She believed there was use for her quilts, while she greatly admired and respected the cleverness and depth of the new generation.

Even John Prior, though he took much less notice of Bennet than the other members of the family did, liked her and considered her, if such an addition to the estabbshment was neces- sary, in the light of an acquisition rather than a detriment. Miss Gray was a little despairing sometimes of her relations to the master of the house. She feared that after all her vain dreams she had made no way with him at all. But she was partly mistaken. Susie Crabtree was gracious and caressing to the Redcot children's governess every time the two women encountered each other. At the same time the popular matron tried to get as much out of the teacher as she could con veniently extract, in the shape of useful hints about lesson books and modes of employing them for the future benefit of Molly and Piers.

He cried, ' Hey ! Miss Gray, ain't you sick of grammars and spelling-books, aud of little sinners wading through them ? Now, how many times have you boxed the small Woods' ears to-day ? Tell me honestly,' and sought to make game of her rather more rudely than he aimed at taking off the rest of his world. Both husband and wife were profuse in their attentions, such as they were, to Bennet Gray, whom that hair-brained enthusiast and learned goose Jane had taken up to such an extent. She had established Miss Gray at Redcot as if she were on a perfect equality with her employers, and it was a great favour on her part to come and stay with them, and receive her board and pocket her salary for being not a quarter of the day in the schoolroom, giving a few elementary lessons to the httle Woods, and for anything more, fooling Jane to the top of her bent. But, of course, Jane would resent"], [203, "SPRING OBLIGATIONS AT KERSHAW 191 furiously any interference with her paragon, any attempt however desirable and gone about with the greatest delicacy, to put her in her proper place. It would be better if it were even in old Rossiter 's place. Mam-ma, who deferred absurdly to Jane, had always been weak in her treatment of subordinates.

Husband and wife arrived on different grounds at the same conclusion. They considered Miss Gray, whom Mrs. Prior described as unaffected and unassuming, very much of a humbug, and de cidedly pretentious for her circumstances. But the Crabtrees did not go out of their way to speak evil of their neighbours : so much might be said for the couple. His role was that of a hail-fellow-well-met with everybody. She was too busy with her own concerns not to forget those of her fellow-creatures who did not cross her path. In that case her instinct was to cajole, and, if possible, win them over, never roundly to abuse them. Time was passing ; the winter had done its worst, and was going \u2014 well-nigh gone.

He added to himself, as he looked into his hock glass, 'You may soon have more to do. I hope your lexicon and theses will put bread into your mouth.' 'What made me inquire,' persisted Jane, in her calm, judicial voice, utterly ignoring her mother's warning glance, 'was that I heard"], [211, "SPRING OBLIGATIONS AT KERSHAW 199 there was a good deal of typhoid fever at Kershaw last winter.' 8 Have you only found that out at this date ?

Jane sat convicted of not having been quite aware either of what took place at the pits or of what was going on in the house. She was not to be let off with this exposure of her weak points. ' Before you unhesitatingly associate typhoid fever with pit sanitation, as you call it,' remarked John Prior with a parting snarl at the word, ' you had better make yourself acquainted with the habits of the miners, the quantity and quality of their food and drink, for instance, the manner in which they manage to shirk the regulations against over-crowding"], [212, "BURIED DIAMONDS 200 their houses with lodgers, and introducing as many bull-dog puppies as infants into the rooms, before you throw ad the blame on the unlucky coal-owners. One would think that a little esprit de corps might come in and help to keep the balance level.' ' I am sorry if I have appeared to reflect upon your arrangements, father,' said Jane, who had really a great respect for her father, and was not beyond making reparation for a supposed wrong done to him. At the same time she was not going to give up her principles. ' If the miners are more gluttonous and drunken than other working men, if they live more like brutes, with their amusements lower and more degrading than other men's amusements, and if this has been true for centuries, I am afraid the proprietors have something to answer for. They may not have meant to wrong the men. The masters may not always have known better in the past, or been able to do better them selves. Still, I cannot see how they can have"], [213, "SPRING OBLIGATIONS AT KERSHAW 201 been without fault,' said Jane, with an earnest desire to be fair. Mr. Prior did not reply ; he was sick of the subject. To twit a man with the sins of the coal-owners when he was on the verge of having no coal to own was worse than useless \u2014 it was the irony of fate. If he had ever been a passive instrument in suffering a great industry to grow without a corresponding provision for the wants and temptations of the labourers in that industry, retribution had come in the shape of the withdrawal of the power, and there was an end of it. Jane's next philanthropic movement was to offer, with Miss Gray's concurrence \u2014 now that the weather was better, but before it had got so fine as to suggest unlimited football and cricket matches for the lads in the afternoons and evenings \u2014 to drive over twice a week to the codiery village of Kershaw on the moor, to help the Rector with his classes. The Rev. Herbert Haynes had exerted himself to open a"], [214, "BURIED DIAMONDS 202 kind of rough club-room for colder lads, with classes for such of them as had any open or smothered wish to improve themselves. But Mr. Haynes was getting up in years, and had a delicate wife, with neither son nor daughter at home. He had many irons in the fire, and he feared he must relinquish this particidar iron from incapacity either to wield it regularly himself or to provide an avadable substitute in his absence. Then Miss Prior came to his aid and offered to go over regularly to Kershaw and teach any branch within her range. She was fired by the idea of hungry aspirants for knowledge being turned away empty from the inexhaustible stores.

The girls did not the soon of their self-imposed task \u2014 when it came to that, one of them was not an amateur ; and if the Board schoolmaster was placed hors de combat by professional scruples and professional fatigue, the same reservation might have applied equally to Bennet Gray. But Bennet had an excellent gift of being interested in everything, especially everything that had to do with Redcot. She extended her interest to the grimy coal-pits \u2014 the gaunt shears and piston, with their relentless iron clang and rattle \u2014 the boilers ostentatiously puffing steam from their safety-valves.

Bennet could almost fancy she heard the rush to the cottage doors, the sobbing wail of women's voices taken up and prolonged, the wildly irregular, feeble patter of the feet of the wives and mothers, hurrying deliriously beyond their strength to know the worst of the tragedy. The experiment in which Jane Prior and Miss Gray took part was fairly successful. The half-grown lads, however uncouth and unruly to their schoolmaster, did not refuse to be amenable to the daughter of the owner of the pits and the other fine young madam, whom at the same time her pupils addressed, in an unvarnished fashion that ought to have"], [219, "AMATEUR LECTURERS 207 done good to the hearts of reformers in education, as ' Schoolmistress.' The drawback was the dense atmosphere of bashfulness that surrounded the scholars. In vain Jane Prior spread out her geographical maps and hung up her physiological diagrams, and gave admi rably succinct yet comprehensive explanations. They were nought against the intangible barrier. Miss Gray followed suit with further lectures, not quite so clear and cuttingly concise perhaps, but in some respects more interesting in their picturesque discursiveness. Neither did she break through the thick . mist of clumsy self consciousness, overpowering false shame, and abject dread of ridicule. If the courageous young lecturers dreamed of anything in the nature of an observation, whether acquiescent or dissentient, from the rude human material they had to work upon, any faintest ghost of a question or an objection to indicate that the audience heard or attended"], [220, "BURIED DIAMONDS 208 to the words spoken, then the rash dreamers found themselves very much mistaken. The girls were considerably daunted by their failure to elicit a spark from the cold iron on which they hammered with all their might. At last it struck Bennet, who was the more original, the more visited by inspiration of the two, to appeal to individual curiosity, ' Have none of you relations abroad that you would hke to hear about ? ' she asked anxiously. A slight sensation followed the speech. One youth was more moved than the rest. Possibly the renown of spiritualism with grotesque varia tions had travelled even to Kershaw Moor, and a display of it was expected, enough to provoke any amount of nudges and grins, for there was no lack of hard-headedness among the sons of the soil.

There were one or two slow nods and well nigh inaudible 8 Ay, surelys ' to the teachers, as wed as sundry nudges \u2014 approving, critical, or derisive \u2014 among the taught, in reply to this offer, and Jane and Bennet threw themselves once more into the undertaking, and renewed their expositions with fresh zest.

Then all at once the lecturers made an as tounding discovery. There was one phlegmatic yoimg miner who had listened to everything and said nothing, that knew all about it before hand.

As he was regarded somewhat in the hght of a monster and a deserter from the traditions of his class by his companions, he mioht be forgiven for hiding his talent in a napkin.

It was as when Brutus spoke with the voice of a man. Jane, who had little or no sense of humour, simply stared. Bennet tittered in a spasmodic effort to restrain a peal of laughter. ' Hear till him ! ' cried the rest of the class ex citedly ; 8 hear till Noah King having the imperence to fault schoolmistress \u2014 set him up !

' It is I and not he who deserve to be punished, only I'm sure you'd excuse a shp of the tongue, and let me say that I'm exceed ingly obliged to Noah King for correcting my mistake. He does credit to his teacher,' she added enviously, with a recollection of the next to futile labours of the last few weeks. Jane had recovered herself. She had a turn for organising and economising power. 8 Noah King,' she said, 8 you take the foot of the class, and if nobody else can answer, you put what you know into your own words, and it will save us from saying it over again.' The device answered, and the station allotted to Noah for bade jealousy. The class increased instead of diminishing, and admission to it was actually coveted. In proof of it, the first lad who had spoken out to the ladies, confided to them that he knew of"], [226, "BURIED DIAMONDS 214 another chap who would come to the club-room if he knew what to do with his 8 babby ' in his absence. He was a young widower, who had neither mother nor sister, while his late wife had come from a distance, and had no relations in the place. He lived alone, save for the child, in a cottage a quarter of a mile off.

It was a puzzling proposal for those who were cultivating popularity, and aiming hard at giving satisfaction. ' I think I know who \" Joe \" is,' said Jane Prior, aside in consultation.

The elderly parish clerk, who was a bachelor, and had never approved of the incongruous introduction of that young fool Joe Jones's bantling, appeared still more shaken. More than one of the remaining oc cupants of the room showed symptoms of re cantation and secession, and of a mean triumph in the flooring of their teachers. Bennet Gray asked if the chdd might be tried with her. She could speak with it in her lap when her turn came, if her hearers woidd not mind. She thought she coidd put the baby girl to sleep. Joe, who was a modest lad, still more sobered down by circurnstanees, felt horrified at the trouble he was causing, and reluctantly consented to impose his burden, which was, nevertheless, precious to him, upon another. Bennet was awkward, to begin with, in the task she had undertaken. She had not been"], [231, "AMATEUR LECTURERS 219 accustomed to very yoimg children. But she acted upon her womanly instincts. She cuddled up the creature in her arms, and bent her lovely, kind face over it.

VISITORS \u2014 MAT CRABTREE, OF HAYBRIDGE, REMEM- BERS A BERESHIRE MISS GRAY. Susie Crabtree, who liked to have a finger in every pie, contrived to look in on these evening classes at Kershaw. She came by herself just for a few minutes, to see what was going on. She won her way out to dinner at a neighbour- ing country house, where she would leave Lambert Crabtree to play cards till the small hours, and sleep till his horse should arrive in time to take him back for a meeting of the bank partners. Such irregularities in his habits were not unusual in the Newton banker, who was supposed to have picked them up in his jovial bachelor days. Mrs. Crabtree had earned"], [234, "BURIED DIAMONDS 222 a reputation for true womanly wisdom in not coming down too hard on practices which she could not pluck up in a day, if they were ever to be thoroughly eradicated. That pretty little fine lady, who had an agreeable word for every body, and was not above claiming a neighbour's help, and taking a tribute of homage from him \u2014 whoever he might be, knew what she was about. Yes, indeed, she knew a great deal better than your puritanically plain, tremend ously sensible, and overpoweringly good madam, who would drive a man to distraction by the height of her virtue, and her rigorous out-and out obedience to its demands. Mrs. Crabtree threw off her fur cloak as she entered the young colliers' class-room, and beamed on the Calibans within, in what was to them the splendour of her lace gown, with the square bodice cut low in front to show the dazzle of her ivory-white neck, and the sleeves only coming to the elbows, leaving the round arms free except for the coils of bracelets. She"], [235, "VISITORS 223 wore strings of soft gleaming pearls in her hair and round her throat, and had pearls and rubies to match and relieve each other at her wrists and in the rings on her singers. The lads sat more open-eyed and open mouthed than Nancy Jones, as the vision flashed upon them. Some of them smiled sillily, as when a dog licks his lips and wags his tail at a treasure utterly beyond his reach. One or two \u2014 among them the heavy lad who knew the machinery of his body, gloomed sulkily, and after the first broad stare looked another way. They would have said, if they could \u2014 \" We won't stand being mocked.

' There were fierce rising democrats and de magogues among the young bears of the Ker shaw pits, as among the young bears elsewhere throughout the country. Lecturers and lectured were nowhere during the few minutes the spectacle lasted and the play was played. If anyone had thought of the business of the evening Susie would not have suffered the thought to pass into action. She had her own part to perform, and she was convinced of its merit and popularity. She glanced round at the maps and diagrams, gave them the customary sweet praise \u2014 a little fainter than usual \u2014 and perpetrated a few smart jokes, which shone with a lustre not the"], [237, "VISITORS 225 less damaging that it was borrowed, at the expense of the solid motive of the meeting. She spoke to one or two of the lads without further abashing them by waiting for an answer. She pitied them with an expressive little shrug for having to come out in the evening in the dry pursuit of knowledge after the fatigue of the day. She asked if they would not like games better, but when told by her sister that there were the materials for such games as draughts, backgammon, dominoes, in the ad joining room on other evenings in the week, paid no attention to the information. Susie contented herself with wondering why the com mittee (there was no committee) did not get up concerts instead of playing at keeping school ? The latter suggestion was in the face of Mrs. Crabtree's knowledge that Jane Prior was not musical and that Miss Gray could not be ex pected to play and sing through a programme \u2014 even if she had the assistance provided by the performance of ' that divine sonata of vol. 1. Q"], [238, "BURIED DIAMONDS 226 Beethoven's you know, dear,' or ' that enchant ing morsel of Schubert's,' which the critic would volunteer to supply. On the other hand, such of the boys as had musical capacities were being trained into a choir elsewhere, whde to supplement the training here would be to relinquish in a great measure the purpose of the gathering, with Mr. Haynes's plans on behalf of this portion of his parishioners. But Susie cared for none of these things. Mrs. Crabtree's last idea was to recall the fact that the Cowpath Races \u2014 the rowdiest races far and near-^the existence of which every master with a scrap even of utilitarian conscience, regretted for his men, would be held in the course of a fortnight. She men tioned these races, and supposed, with an arch nod, the lads would all be there. No, none of them was to get up on her account, Susie said, as she moved to go \u2014 a prohibition which had the effect of causing all the youths, including the incensed authority"], [239, "VISITORS 227 on the circulation of the blood, to stumble to their feet. Well, if they would do it, she would take just one of them. She fixed on the worst lad there, who was also an imposing-looking, swarthy young giant, to see her out and open the carriage door for her. The selected escort blushed up and grinned in triumph, whde his companions glared at him enviously. ' She is not to come here again,' Jane, who was much disturbed, vowed to her coadjutor. ' Do you see how she has unsettled the class ? It is horrid to say it of one's sister \u2014 I suppose she cannot help it \u2014 but Susie's manner to all men \u2014 great and smad, old and young, has always. something of flirtation in it. I hate it,' muttered honest Jane, ' it makes me feel so ashamed.' If Jane had fodowed Mrs. Crabtree to the door she would have seen her encounter Mr. Haynes, and work upon the exemplary, but slightly grumpy, elderly clergyman with her a 2"], [240, "228 BURIED DIAMONDS blandishments. She dropped her bewildered collier escort with a gracious nod, and ap pealed to Mr. Haynes for his convoy. She kept him standing bareheaded, with his pepper and-salt hair blowing in the cold spring wind, for five minutes, though she had prefaced her conversation with the dutiful announcement that she could not keep her husband waiting, and it was that wifely consideration which opened another husband's heart. She wreathed her charming face in smiles. She paid her companion pretty humble compli ments on his good offices in general, and this class-room for the pit boys in particular. As her father's daughter, she begged to offer Mr. Haynes the small return of her heartfelt thanks. And Mr. Haynes was deeply touched by Mrs. Crabtree's condescension and sympathy in paying this flying visit, and doing so much mischief within its flight. He had barely thanked Jane Prior and Bennet Gray for their"], [241, "VISITORS 229 punctual appearance two nights a-week, and for all their labour and pains. He had made them feel, for their good, no doubt, that the help they gave was no more than their duty. He had groaned audibly, and shown himself sternly disinclined to let Jane off from her task, when the cold in her head, which still dis figured her even when it was going off, was at its worst, and Mrs. Prior positively forbade her daughter to expose herself to the evening air. He had not concealed the fact that single women by no means ranked with married women in his estimation. Neither had he hidden his impression that the former made too much of their trifling ailments. Before the culprits claimed indulgence on such pleas the maidens ought to be matrons accountable to husbands for the complainants' health and well being. Then the case was entirely altered. For if a clergywoman, for instance, was out of health or was doing too much for her own peace of mind, it interfered seriously with the"], [242, "BURIED DIAMONDS 230 comfort of her lord and master, besides harrow ing his conjugal feelings. Mrs. Crabtree was not the only visitor at the Kershaw class-room, though visitors as a rule were prohibited. Mr. Haynes vindicated his right to break through the rules which he himself had laid down, by bringing in with him one evening, just as the work was over, a big man in the prime of life, whom Miss Gray guessed, by what she had heard, and by the first words said, to be Mr. Crabtree, of Haybridge, Lambert Crabtree's elder brother. Mat Crabtree was a curious commentary on the assertion that ad our vices are only virtues which have run riot and grown corrupted. The hereditary traits which he shared in com mon with Lambert, were marked, and it would have been difficult not to recognise the two men as brothers, but while Bennet Gray detested the one with only a civil veil thrown over the detestation, she felt as if without any prompt-"], [243, "VISITORS 231 ing, she could like the other. He was all that Lambert pretended to be, and was all that he might have been if rank tares had not grown up and choked the wheat of his better nature. Mat Crabtree was the elder born \u2014 the squire ; while the banker who had succeeded to the more profitable inheritance, and made the most of it, and was, to all appearance, the richer man, could only be squirish in his tendencies, and ape the country gentlemen whose bearing and surroundings were the objects of his ambition. It was quite lately that he had tacked Ladslove to his name in reference to the transaction by which he had secured the small farm to the bank, and managed afterwards to change it into a private possession. Lambert Crabtree's bulk and floridness, which were coarse and would soon be gross, unwieldy, and rubicund, in Mat Crabtree would never be anything more than the be coming, slight portliness and rosiness, for his"], [244, "BURIED DIAMONDS 232 constitution and years, of a temperate man who would keep himself in training up to old age by the hard exercise which he loved. Where Lambert was bragging and bullying in his bluffness, Mat was only frank and cordial. Mat, too, was fond of field sports, but his fond ness for hunting and shooting, like his fondness for farming, had been qualified and dignified by the reputation for scholarship which he had brought with him from the university, and still retained, not without reason, after more than twenty years' retirement at Haybridge. Mat was also given to rallying his neighbours \u2014 above all, Jane Prior. He had known her from her childhood, and especially from the time of his brother's marriage. She had con tinued a standing wonder to him, which he had contemplated with a mixture of admiration and amusement. But Mat's rallying attitude was by no means the sole attitude of his mind towards any human being ; it was that of a man of good sense and good feeling who"], [245, "VISITORS 233 respects his neighbour as he respects himself. The raillery was seldom ill-timed, and, though it provoked Jane, and was apt to cause her to treat the offender with lofty disdain, the provo cation was rather due to the lack of humour in the woman, which in itself tickled Mat Crab tree, than to any real ground of complaint on her part. For he was with most people the well- liked man who could, almost without try ing it, influence his fellows, which Lambert sought to be, only partially succeeding in the attempt. There was one thing in which Lambert Crabtree had the advantage over Mat, if it could be called an advantage. The younger brother, at the age of forty-three, put in claims to a jaunty perennial form of youths ulness, which the elder at forty-five had long left behind him. Lambert was a gay, scarcely sobered down Benedict, after eight years' ex perience of the character. Mat only two years older, hale and active in his prime, was reckoned"], [246, "BURIED DIAMONDS 234 by himself and by others who took him at his own reckoning as a confirmed rustic student and bachelor, fairly buried among his fields and books. The marriage of Lambert Crabtree to Susie Prior had forged a strong link between Mat Crabtree and the Priors in spite of various obstacles. In the first place, Lambert was by no means a popular son and brother-in-law. In the second, the brothers did not see much of each other, and, notwithstanding the cari catured likeness between them, had grown to differ more widely than they agreed. In the third, Haybridge was farther from Redcot than Newton was, and there had not been the apology of actual relationship for compelling intercourse between the families, which Susie and her children supplied. Still, by dint of natural affinity, Mat Crab tree had been in the habit till lately of coming more frequently and familiarly to the Priors than his brother had ever done, save during"], [247, "VISITORS 235 the short period of his courtship. But since Bennet Gray's stay at Redcot, Mr. Crabtree of Haybridge had been so keenly alive to the barrier erected by Lambert Crabtree's behavi our with regard to the minerals on Ladslove, that he had refrained from intruding under John Prior's roof. As time wore on, how ever, and Lambert continued foiled, Mat be came glad of an excuse to overleap the barrier. He had been on his way with an errand to Redcot, when, having occasion to call at Ker shaw Rectory in passing, he was told by Mr. Haynes that Miss Prior and the young lady who was governess to the little Woods were at that moment in the collier lads' class-room. 8 Why, what are they doing there ? ' the visitor asked. ' Let us have a look,' was the next idea. ' It will save me the trouble of going on to Redcot if Miss Prior will take my message.' Then the two gentlemen presented them selves in time to see the ladies preparing to"], [248, "236 BURIED DIAMONDS start. Had Mr. Haynes and his companion come earlier, no doubt Jane would have limited her recognition of their presence to a grave salutation, and would have gone on steadily, though it might be a little stiffly, with what she was saying, calling on Miss Gray to follow suit. And Bennet might have complied after a struggle, for she held herself as under orders ; but though she ought to have been the more hardened of the two to the ordeal, she was glad to be spared it. ' It is bad enough to go off the lines to the boys,' she thought, doing her thinking, as wid be readily observed, in a scandalously slangy manner, ' but it would have been terrible to have had my \" Outlines of Animal Physiology \" gauged by a stranger who may be an inspector of schools, though I believe he is Mr. Crabtree, of Haybridge, a university man and a scholar, which is not much better.' So Miss Gray listened with pleasure to the"], [249, "VISITORS 237 clatter of the heavy boots of the pupils as they dismissed themselves. In the meantime Mat Crabtree was shaking hands with Jane Prior, and telling her plea santly, ' I am glad to see you so well employed, Jane, giving what you have received.' At that moment a twinkle came into his clear blue eyes \u2014 nearer the sky in colour than the steel tint of Jane's eyes allowed hers to be. ' What is it you are imparting to the young colliers?

Jane did not in the least understand it. As a rule she was careless of such contretemps in society. But when her attention was arrested, as in the present case, her esprit de corps and her friendship were alike up in arms. What earthly right had one person to dispute another's identity ?

She had failed to reply to the appeal as to whether she had not been in Berkshire, and the rest of her reply was thoroughly ambiguous. ' There may be many Miss Grays even in Berk shire.'

'Young ladies are so careless about draughts, and wraps, and ordinary precautions against illness,' he said aloud, quite plaintively.

He, Mat Crabtree, was not influenced by the accident, that he happened to be Crabtree of Haybridge who was conferring an honour in speaking in a friendly fashion to a stranger \u2014 a young woman, the governess to John Prior's grandchildren.

He would work her a world more harm ; while she had been thinking that she would like him, and they might become friends. How did it strike Jane and Mr. Haynes?

Mat Crabtree would not be hindered from wrapping up the girls and handing them to their seats, by the trifling objection that he was in bad odour with both of the women. He said his good-byes cheerfully, and with what sounded a positively malicious heaping up of insult on injury. He called after them, 'I hope to see you both at Haybridge on Thursday, when we shall have plenty of time to follow the ramifications of the Grays, and to settle the connection between Miss Gray, here, and the other \u2014 the Berkshire Miss Gray.

This lack of leisure, with a certain con stitutional abstraction of mind, impaired her power of sympathy, but it rendered her in another sense easy to live with, and gave her the appearance of larger toleration than she actually possessed. But there are incidents which rouse the most unwary and the most charitable. Something is said or done by the"], [265, "AN APPEAL TO A MAN'S HONOUR 253 member of a circle totally different from what might have been expected, unaccountable, except in one light.

Miss Gray had looked and spoken \u2014 or rather had not spoken \u2014 so strangely, had been so unlike an open, upright woman who has nothing to conceal, and had grown so agitated under Mr. Crabtree's mal-apropos cross-ques tioning in the Kershaw class-room, that a distinctly uncomfortable impression had been made on those present. The exception had been Mr. Haynes, who had not been attending part of the time, whose mind, long accustomed to run in one meritorious groove, seldom ranged beyond sermon-writing and parish work, and"], [266, "BURIED DIAMONDS 254 who had coined a word for the benefit of young ladies, that word being ' vagarious.' But already Mat Crabtree, who had been full of his own idea, and noticed little at the moment, on thinking the matter over in his house at Haybridge, was taking himself severely to task, and telling himself he had been an inquisitive, inconsiderate old idiot, who had put his foot into it, and made a fine mess. Something was out of joint, though he could not pretend to say what. He did not believe he had been mistaken in his recognition of Miss Gray. The fine face was not only remarkable for its bloom of womanly beauty, there were too many points of resemblance to make error probable. Why she should be the governess at Redcot under a cloud, as it appeared, he could not conjecture. Nobody might be much to blame, or the wrong-doer might be sorry for the past and striving to retrieve it. And there had he gone, like an intolerable meddler and hunter after game, prowling and scenting and"], [267, "AN APPEAL TO A MAN'S HONOUR 255 raising a timid persecuted creature for ought that he knew.

Or he might, as was more likely, be entirely wrong, confusing her with some namesake of hers, whom he fancied she resembled, of whom and of whose relatives she knew nothing. What did it matter? Who need care? Yet Miss Gray, for some occult reason known only to herself, had cared, and cared very much. Jane could not deny it to herself. What of that again? Some people were so much more sensitive than others. Miss Gray had not looked like one of these thin skinned folk, but most of us have \u2014 say one vulnerable spot in our armour. Miss Gray might have poor relations in Berkshire, or she might be so unfortunate as to own kindred who were worse than poor \u2014 disreputable. Jane believed stoutly that if she had poor relations or disreputable kindred she would own the one and disown the other with the stern intrepidity"], [269, "AN APPEAL TO A MAN'S HONOUR 257 of a Brutus, stid she could forgive Miss Gray if her pride was more foolish, or her self-respect less vigorous. But do as Jane would \u2014 candid, confiding soul as she was \u2014 with ad her panoply of philo sophy and learning, she coidd not get rid of the conviction that there had been something personal at the root of Miss Gray's distress \u2014 that her trouble, if she had a trouble, was an individual affair. In opposition to Jane's lofty principles, and strong prepossessions \u2014 in spite of her reverence for knowledge in any shape, and the common cause she was disposed to make with every woman intedectuady engaged \u2014 against Jane's very will, she began to look on Miss Gray with other eyes, to see her in a different hght, to watch and make a record of ad the small particulars of her behaviour, and give them a new meaning.

She had taken pains to show the public how she regarded Miss Gray, and how she desired it to regard her ; and as Mrs. Prior was of the same mind as her daughter in the matter, the public had responded civilly, as it generally will in such a case. Miss Gray had paid occasional visits with Jane, and more rarely with Mis. Prior. Miss Gray had helped the family to receive visitors at home, and she had been treated by others as the Priors treated her \u2014 as it would have been an offence to them, if, when so doing, their neighbours had done otherwise \u2014 hke any other young lady, not a governess, living at Redcot.

And in their very carelessness the couple always indicated a line of demarcation, and showed that to them, though they might hail her familiarly or propose to pet her, as their varying humours moved them, Miss Gray was, after ad, the governess at Redcot, no more and no less. Miss Gray had grown up under the new hght cast on those who rear the future women of England, but it might be that she had not always found the light set on a candlestick and not hid in a bushel, or else there was something in her relations to the Priors which stirred her to grateful affection. She had till now welcomed the occasional visiting in the happy, cordial spirit with which any other perfectly natural, well-balanced young woman more than 82"], [272, "260 BURIED DIAMONDS content to work will keenly relish a little play. She had displayed the same lively interest in the Redcot neighbours, the same intuitive per ception of their characters and histories that she had evinced with regard to the place itself and its surroundings. This sympathetic identi fication of herself with the Priors in reference to their home and their friends had been one of Bennet Gray's crowning graces, especially in the eyes of Mrs. Prior, who, though retiring in her habits, was very friendly in her nature. But the identification broke down inexplicably when the invitation to Haybridge came on the tapis. It was clear to any observer whose eyes were opened that Miss Gray's instant instinct was \"to shrink from going to Mr. Crabtree's, and that she was ready to urge any plea which might obviate the necessity. In ordinary cir cumstances an excuse on the ground of health would have been too glaringly preposterous. Bennet Gray, in spite of her studies, was like"], [273, "AN APPEAL TO A MAN'S HONOUR 261 the most illiterate of hunting, shooting, fishing, racing, flirting-in-the-open-air, flirting-in-the ballroom, dancing-till-break-of-day women.

An apology which would have been usuady so broad a contradiction must have struck herself in that hght, and shamed her ingenuity in this direction. Yet she had been so unlike herself, id at ease and nervous since that encounter in the Kershaw class-room, that she might even have posed as an invalid without imposing too great a strain on the credulity of her audience.

Her company could not fail to be an intrusion when Mr. Crabtree had particularly invited Miss Prior to meet her sister, and the party was to be a family party. Mrs. Prior would be lonely left all day by herself, when Mr. Prior had so many engagements. At last the ominously numerous \" excuses resolved them selves into the desperate assertion that she \u2014 Bennet Gray \u2014 had nothing suitable to wear. There was only one response.

Tom or Sam could go on the box with the driver, the child would like nothing better, and the two other children could sit together perfectly well on the back seat. She would like Miss Gray's company, of course, if she did not object to go on any other account \u2014 and here, to Jane's dismay, her own voice took a"], [275, "AN APPEAL TO A MAN'S HONOUR 263 perceptibly distant, aggrieved tone before she knew or could help it. She hastened to add that she would be glad of Miss Gray to help her with the children. She had nothing to say to Mrs. Crabtree which all the world might not hear. Mr. Crabtree's invitation to Miss Gray was sufficient proof that the party was not limited to near relatives or famdy connec tions. The chddren cried clamorously that Miss Gray must go and see Mr. Crabtree's lambs and calves. Haybridge was far better than the Bank House, and they liked Mr. Crabtree ever so much more than they liked Uncle Lambert. Mr. Crabtree never plagued them, or if he did he made up for it by showing them things which they liked to see, and letting them do what they pleased, so long as the little boys were not rough to their sister, or did not quarrel, or trouble Aunt Jane. Aunt Susie would be there, and though she did not take much notice of them, when she did it was to"], [276, "264 BURIED DIAMONDS praise them, to forbid their being contradicted, and to give them all the good things on the table. Aunt Susie was so pretty, and had such beautiful clothes, that Ady constantly got ideas for Anna Maria Constance's wardrobe from her aunt's toilet. Mody and Piers liked Mr. Crabtree and Haybridge also, and were not half so wild and given to wanting everything their own way as when they were at home. Chubby Sam went so far as to say Hay bridge would not be worth while without Miss Gray ; and perhaps he and she might go in search of peacocks' feathers instead of turkeys' feathers, like Tom's, for Mr. Crabtree kept pea cocks. Or the couple might be so fortunate as to find the thrashing-mill going, for Mr. Crabtree's mid did not stand always like their old thing, then he and she might stand and watch the corn running through. If Miss Gray did not yield to these adure ments, the obstacle was not to be found in Mrs. Prior. She held to it with smiling"], [277, "AN APPEAL TO A MANS HONOUR 265 determination that nothing warranted her in keeping Miss Gray from making acquaintance with Haybridge. Mrs. Prior was partial enough to think that Miss Gray would not hke it so wed as Redcot. Still, almost every country place had its advantages ; Haybridge was not without them ; while Mr. Crabtree was a kind host as well as an excedent man. She herself had often enjoyed going over there, and her famiharity with the spot would render her the better able to appreciate what she hoped Miss Gray would ted her of first impressions. In the interval she would do very wed with the quilt she had in hand, her book, and Tommy. 8 Oh, fie ! Tommy, to yawn at the prospect.' In fact, Tommy did more than yawn as an appropriate commentary on his mistress's speech, and a symbol of the drowsy day in store for him, he proceeded to transform himself into an inverted curtainless four-post bed \u2014 lying on his broad back, with ad his thick legs in the air. The performance"], [278, "BURIED DIAMONDS 266 caused great gratification to the children, who were alternately Tommy's delight and his torment. Then Mrs. Prior went out of her way, as it sounded to Bennet, to range herself on the side of the enemy, and gratuitously give an opinion which would have been agreeable to hear at any other time. Miss Gray need not trouble about dress ; she always looked nice. That serge she was wearing would do capitally, if she did not grudge it, for sauntering about the fields and garden, being pulled about by the children, and sharing their dinner and high tea. It was within a day of Thursday's visit that Bennet's last defence was thus placidly bowled over. And it was on the Wednesday afternoon that Jane Prior, going into the schoolroom, found Miss Gray so busy writing a letter that she was standing in her bonnet and jacket at the desk with her pen flying over the page. In the meantime Tom and Sam were"], [279, "AN APPEAL TO A MANS HONOUR 267 building houses with a pile of lesson books, and Ally was dressing a reluctant kitten in some of Anna Maria Constance's cast-off finery. ' I am afraid you are too late with your letter, Miss Gray,' said Jane, on the impulse of the moment, ' the post-bag left ten minutes ago.' 'Thanks for telling me,' answered Bennet, not looking up, and hastily scribbling her signature, ' but I mean to walk across to the post-office, and the children are coming with me. Run away, Ally, with Tom and Sam to Nursie, and get your hats and coats, or I shall not be able to wait for you.' There was a little post-office at a toll-bar about a mde from Redcot, but the Priors' letters rarely went there ; they were sent direct to Newton. The walk to the post-office was not a favourite one. It was along a rough by-road full of miry ruts in early spring, within thin straggling hedgerows, dividing poor fields that had not been long brought in"], [280, "268 BURIED DIAMONDS from a corner of Kershaw Moor. The land scape would present a dreary outlook under the watery sinking sun, which conveyed httle or no warmth so late in the afternoon. The celandines and daisies which had been budding and bursting open in the morning would be either closed tightly again, or presenting a frost-bitten, pinched look to the approaching raw chid of the evening. Miss Gray was adowing herself scanty time to reach Cross-Trees Post-Office and get back with the children before dusk. Hardly a moment after the thought had crossed Jane's mind, she saw from the staircase window, which she was passing in order to go up to her room, Bennet Gray and the chddren going down the avenue, posting as for a wager, or on an errand of life and death, to traverse the unattractive road to and from Cross-Trees. Jane Prior was not a martinet \u2014 a finicking intermeddler with those under her supervision."], [281, "AN APPEAL TO A MAN'S HONOUR 269 But she could not help asking herself where was the need of this hurry to the post-office at an ungenial hour by an unattractive road? Why could Miss Gray not send her letters, like other people, in the post-bag, which would carry them, without trouble on her part, to Newton ? If her letter was not written in time, what important correspondence had she in which the delay of a single post was of vital consequence ? Jane told herself she had no business to ask this even of herself; it was no concern of hers. It was mean of her to speculate in this manner. Still the knowledge remained that Jane was aware Miss Gray had no near relations. No doubt many women in her position seek to indemnify themselves for the absence of close domestic ties by a kind of artificial circle of complaisant acquaintances, with whom the solitary woman is ready to correspond on any or no pretext, deluding herself into the belief"], [282, "BURIED DIAMONDS 270 that she has as many friends as other women possess. But Miss Gray was not one of these women of many facile, spurious friendships, always in a state of active effervescence on paper. She had not found time in the course of her busy life to do more than make a few strong, lasting friendships. These were mostly among young women like herself, earning an honest, honourable independence, as Mat Crab tree had put it, making their way in the world. Or else the correspondents were the parents and guardians of these young women, who took a cordial, reflected interest in her. To them she was content, as she had told Jane, to write at the rate of once a month, or once in the three months, according to the degrees of intimacy. Jane fought against such idle, unworthy suspicions, which had been making her unhappy of late ; when in an inconceivably short time, as it seemed, little Alice Wood tapped at her aunt's room door to tell her the walking party"], [283, "AN APPEAL TO A MANS HONOUR 271 were back.

Then she said it was ad right, only no thanks to Sam ; and she asked him what Mr. Crabtree, of Haybridge, would have done to him if he had not got his letter ? I think Miss Gray had been writing to Mr. Crabtree to say we are ad coming to-morrow \u2014 don't you? \u2014 though she did not ted me or ask if we had any message. Now, was it not naughty of Sam, Aunt Jane? ' ' Yes, Ally ; but you are naughty too to tell tales on Sam, and chatter so much,' cried Jane. ' Go away and ask Miss Gray to pour out tea for granny.

What could cause her to do such a thing ? The child might be somehow mistaken, or the old woman might have misread the address. But that was unlikely, and if it had been so, surely Miss Gray, knowing that little pitchers have ears, would have corrected the mistake, and Ally, so ready with her tongue, would have repeated the cor rection, along with what had gone before it. No ; there is such a thing as taking probabilities into account, and a logical mind can hardly avoid doing so.

Was her letter an appeal to his honour to preserve silence on such of her antecedents as she did not choose to make public ? Strange as it sounded it looked alarmingly like it. Again, if this were so, why did Miss Gray select Mr. Crabtree for her confidant ?

Miss Gray, in her unconsciousness of any fresh betrayal through the children's chatter, seemed so relieved by what she had done that Jane was tempted to doubt all that had gone before it, and think she had been the victim of her imagination. The spring day was one of those exception ally fine ones of which the English climate can sometimes boast. The party started, to all appearance, in excedent spirits, and the drive was not long enough to weary the children. Haybridge was a large, square, comparatively modern white house, which, with its super abundance of green railings and palisadings,"], [289, "FALSE LIGHTS 277 its chain of ponds, that included a hand-bridge and a boathouse like an old-fashioned summer house, might almost have been modelled on a Flemish or a German country house. The best that could be said for the house was that it looked roomy, comfortable, and cheerful. It stood in a smad park with the by no means extensive ground prettily broken. Other gains consisted of a hid, which rose behind the house, and was for a large part of the year dotted with Mr. Crabtree's sheep. There were also meadows which stretched in front down to a trout stream stealing along beneath a fringe of osiers. These meadows formed, in summer, pasture-ground for Mr. Crabtree's cattle. They were acknow ledged to be the finest, far and near, and as they browsed they helped rather than hindered the general repose of the scene. Mr. Crabtree awaited his guests at one of the green gates. He was a tad, broad figure, easy and authoritative-looking as he stood there in his rough tweeds, with his air of mature"], [290, "278 BURIED DIAMONDS mastership of all about him, and his handsome, vigorous face equally mature and somewhat masterful too, lit up with good-humoured hos pitality. The whole man was in entire keeping with his surroundings. He lifted out the chil dren and exchanged words with them. He shook hands with the young ladies, and thanked them heartily for their company. ' This is very good of you, Jane ; I am much obliged to you for coming and making it livelier for Susie.' His next sentence was addressed to Miss Gray. Did it contain any double entendre ? ' That is right of you, Miss Gray, to come and see what Haybridge is hke.' He praised her lightly. ' We must try and make the place show itself in its best colours to a strange lady, mustn't we, Sam ? But we hope she will be better acquainted with it and us, so we must not let any objectionable nonsense slip out.' Was there more meant than met the ear ? Jane coidd not tell. Mr. Crabtree spoke in a half jestmg tone, but he did not laugh. His gaiety"], [291, "FALSE LIGHTS 279 was not without the grave kindness and marked respect which she could imagine him man and gentleman enough to show to a woman whom he was called upon to re-assure, whose fears he sought to lay to rest. But, when it came to that, Mat Crabtree was tolerablj7 sure to be studiously considerate in his very friendliness to any woman whom a large proportion of the world would judge socially his inferior, because of her lack of the world's goods aud her inde pendence in working for her bread. Withal there was something contradictory in Mat Crabtree's look and manner. Jane fancied she caught amidst the serious courtesy and interest of his voice and face, a twinkle of the blue eyes, as if they said in spite of him, ' I recognise the comicality of the situa tion.' Miss Gray blushed vividly, and it might be she hung her head a little. But Bennet Gray had a trick of blushing, and the hanging her head, if she did hang it, was so slight and mo-"], [292, "BURIED DIAMONDS 280 mentary that the inclination coidd not be counted on any more than the blush. Indeed, Jane was not certain that there was not a fleeting response, a twinkle in the hazel eyes, in accordance with the twinkle in the blue, as Bennet looked up the next instant. She appeared happy and at her ease afterwards, allowing the children to drag her here and there, and point out some of the wonderful things which were to be seen at Haybridge. Susie and her babies, as she persisted in cading them, though the little boy and girl were as old as Tom and Sam Wood, had arrived beforehand. Susie was already presiding in her brother-in-law's house, graciously ordering .and patronising everybody and everything to a greater extent, perhaps, than Mat Crabtree altogether approved. Lambert Crabtree had not come with his wife, an omission which nobody, not even Susie, pretended to regret. Whatever his presence might be on other festi val occasions, it was certainly not desirable at a"], [293, "FALSE LIGHTS 281 family party where women and children pre dominated. There was an immense deal to do, and a limited time to do it in. There was first lun cheon \u2014 brown soup and chicken pie, and the junket for which Haybridge was famous, with special dainties of cakes and fruit for the children. It was served in the big square dining room, containing pictures of the master of the house's father and mother, and of himself and his brother when they were round-faced, round eyed boys hke Tom and Sam. That room seemed to have been made for twelve people dining in it ad the year round ; but Mat Crabtree, as he presided over the luncheon, did not look as if he would ever sing smad or feel forlorn when he was eating his meals there alone.' The children resumed their hats and coats, for the visitors had to be taken up to the hill to see the lambs, away to the offices to inspect the calves, over to the ponds to count the goslings"], [294, "282 BURIED DIAMONDS and ducklings, with a detour to the poultry yard to find the earliest turkeys' eggs to carry home to granny. The round imphed an amount of fatigue, which was trying for little legs, though Mr. Crabtree carried one and sometimes a couple of the Redcot or the New ton children on his shoulders the most of the way. At last the children were installed in the half empty, disused drawing-room, where there was nothing to spoil. It was understood that httle people can only rest by romping in another form, as horses can only rest standing, so bricks, marbles, and balls, a cat and her kittens were thoughtfully provided for the guests. Miss Gray offered to stay and be play mistress, and Susie, amidst profuse thanks, managed to convey softly that the part was one side of Bennet's calling for life. ' You are so fond of children, dear Miss Gray, and they are so fond of you, that you ought never to be separated. I quite envy your dehghtful way with the babies.'"], [295, "FALSE LIGHTS 283 The real state of the case was that Susie troubled herself very little with the two big, red, light-eyed, boisterous bantlings that were so like their father. She seldom contradicted them, for she craved their homage, as she did that of every living creature. But when they would have been in her way as might have happened often, particularly since they were not ornamental, she sent them from her without a pang. She sweetly entrusted them to their nurse, or to Susie's French maid, or to any other constrained or complacent person who would take the children off their mother's hands. There was not much harm in the poor little things as yet, only they were not en gaging. Mat Crabtree's heart occasionally ached for them, he could hardly have told why. He now enacted that they could play with their Redcot cousins, and even if there did come a collision, his housekeeper, who was somewhat of a personage \u2014 elderly, stately, but not un genial \u2014 was prepared to settle all disputes, and"], [296, "BURIED DIAMONDS 284 if the disputants were good, and got on her right side, she might even tell them a story when they were tired. Mr. Crabtree would not, on any account, permit the sacrifice of Miss Gray to her duties, against which Jane Prior also protested. 'Children are all very well,' he said per emptorily, ' but their elders are glad to get rid of them sometimes ; eh, Jane ? We are all out having holiday for the day, ain't we ?

The garden of Haybridge was, like the house, chiefly remarkable for answering the end proposed. It had been sensibly laid out, was productive even at this season, and left a wholesome impression on the minds of the visitors that nothing was neglected or forgotten. From the sea-kad to the rhubarb, everything was looked to properly. The newly-dug, smoothly-raked beds, the young plants in the frames, the very heaps of leaves and bundles of sticks were there in a state of hopeful prepara tion. There was only one small hot-house, because Mr. Crabtree did not want many grapes, and cared more for open-air native flowers than for the exotics of a conservatory. But here,"], [298, "BURIED DIAMONDS 286 too, the hyacinths and jonquils, heaths and azaleas did credit both to Mr. Crabtree and his gardener.

The straw-coloured primroses and their milk-white sisters were waiting for the next moon before they were rife. The anemones and polyanthuses only presented their aggres sive green sheaths. The wad-flowers held up their heads, but displayed no more than the iron-brown edges of the petals wed shrouded in the slaty calyxes.

It was in the garden that the party fell into pairs \u2014 Mrs. Crabtree walking with her sister, and Mr. Crabtree accompanying Miss Gray, whom he invited to turn down a side walk in order to look at a singularly situated last year's nest. Susie could not object to be left with Jane for a few minutes, though the young matron was wont to appropriate as her right any man in the company, and was quite honest in expressing her preference for male society. She took advantage of her present deprivation"], [300, "288 BURIED DIAMONDS to link her arm in Jane's, looking a fragile little creature beside her tall sister, and to deliver her mind of a warning.

Suppose I not only felt such a course of conduct to be my duty, but was able to put it in practice, and could turn my education and whatever abilities I have to good account, do you intend to say you or anybody else would be justified in regarding my circumstances as sad ? ' 8 1 don't know about the justification,' said Mrs. Susie, shaking her lovely little head ; ' but I'm afraid we'd do it, justified or not. It is the verdict of the world, and, my dear child, there must be something in that.'

' But the world is getting wiser.' ' It is quite wise enough for me,' said Susie, coolly. 8 Now, don't lose your temper, it is not worth while. Besides, did I not begin by saying Miss Gray is a charming person, quite handsome in her own style, ladylike, and all that which makes her the more dangerous ? Yes, that is the right word, though you are so dreadfully touchy that I am almost frightened to use it. For girls in her position \u2014 you may hold what extravagant notions you like about it, you dear, high-flown, learned goose ! the sharp-sighted world judges differently \u2014 have a double motive for breaking away from their disadvantages and establishing themselves credi tabby.'
