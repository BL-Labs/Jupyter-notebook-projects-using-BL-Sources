Come back with me to an Italy which knew not Cavour, on which the star of Napoleon III. had not risen, when Garibaldi was unknown, Victor Em manuel unthought of, and Pius IX. the popular idol. At that time the peninsula lay, as it were, in the shadow of Austria, for with the Kaiser's support, the lesser sovereigns reigned absolutely over a people in whose minds the remembrance of the Revolution was still fresh, and whose frequent outbreaks showed how unwelcome was the re-establishment of the old regime. b 2"], [12, "INTRODUCTION. 4 It was a time of awakening throughout the land, there was a cry for constitu- tions and reforms ; the sovereigns ap- peared about to yield to the wishes of their people, and the head of the Church led the van. It seemed as if Liberty and Catholicism were to be revived and united at the same moment, and the dream of a Confederation of the Italian States, under the leadership of the Pope, appeared likely to be realized. The hatred of foreign rule was rising uncontrollably in the North, and the emissaries of the Secret Societies fanned with unwearied activity the spark of insurrection which no increase of severity on the part of the Austrian governors could quench.

T^^TcJT was late in the autumn of the /H IP\\ year 1^47, an(^ sea hung $^\"-S??| thick over Venice and covered the main-land as far as Padua. Tbe diligence from Rovigo had come in, and the waiting-room of the railway station"], [16, "VALERIA. 8 was nearly full. There were great varieties of people there, patient women with their baskets, and bundles of all shapes and sizes, men with diminutive carpet bags, quietly smoking to pass the time, all bearing the delay with placid resignation, and Austrian officers, with tall figures and clanking sabres. Among the Italians there were two whose ap pearance might have betokened something worthy of notice. One of them showed more impatience during the long waiting time than any others of the party ; he walked up and down and looked out of the windows, watched the movements of the officials on the platform, consulted his orario frequently, and all this with an irritated aspect which the glance he cast from time to time at the Austrian officers seemed only to increase. He was a tall man of distinguished appearance, with"], [17, "VALERIA. 9 features of unusual regularity, eyebrows black and arched, and eyes whose im petuous expression brightened the im passiveness of a very handsome face, for Cesar Foran was noted for his good looks. Of a noble Savoyard family, his height and athletic figure bore witness to the mountain race from which he sprang, while his soft-toned voice and expressive eyes showed on which side of the Alps the family alliances had been made. It was strange that a Piedmontese officer should be on his way to Venice, when every day was bringing a nearer prospect of war between Austria and Sardinia; but the Marchese Foran had special business, he was about to visit the family of his fiancee and complete an engagement entered into some years before by his parents and those of"], [18, "VALERIA. 10 Ernestine Zenar. That he only half liked his errand was evident, by his impatient movements and discontented expression. As he turned from the window, his eyes glanced again round the room as if in search of some object of interest which might help him to wile away the time and distract his thoughts. Overlooking the Austrian officers, the natural enemies of his country, with a rapidity which showed they were to him no pleasant sight, his glance encountered that of a boy, who with his hands in his pockets was half leaning, half sitting on the centre table, and whose gaze made him almost start with a sensation, as if he had involuntarily been uttering aloud the thoughts that had passed through his mind, and those eyes were in response warning him that their owner had heard"], [19, "VALERIA. 11 and understood them. His glance fell, and when he looked again there was nothing to confirm the impression. The youth was of average height, judging by his countrymen, with a slight active figure, his face was young, almost too young for the well-trimmed moustache that adorned it; his cap seemed large enough to cover the whole head, and threw a dark shade over the eyes whose glance had so startled C^sar Foran. Near him, and leaning against the table, were the Austrian officers talking cheerfully in German, heedless of the scowls of the rest of the company. \" The Greek weaves the web and the Jew cuts it out,\" said one of them. \" The Jew will cut his own throat before long,\" replied the other. \" And the world will be well rid of him \u2014 the man is possessed.\""], [20, "VALERIA. 12 \"He is a fine fellow in the main, and has a strong brain,\" said the second, \"I rather admire him.\" \" But the Greek is under French pro tection, if it were not for that he would have been called to account long ago, his house is a very hotbed of sedition.\" \" You find your way there pretty often, Stadler,\" said his companion, laughing. \" My opinions are beyond suspicion at any rate,\" replied Stadler. \" I intend that the Count shall make me welcome also,\" said his friend, \"he is an accomplished man \u2014 I like him ; I esteem all men of that stamp, they may be mistaken, but they are sincere.\" \" The Kaiser would not thank you for saying so,\" said Stadler, raising his eye brows incredulously, \"I, on the contrary,"], [21, "VALERIA. 13 am equally sincere in despising the whole crew.\" \" We are not speaking in an absolutely unknown tongue,\" said the other, \" and your sentiments won't win you good will.\" \" Nor yours either if they are known at head-quarters,\" said Stadler. Arnhorst stood up and walked to the door, beyond which the officials on the platform began to show signs of activity. As he did so, the boy raised his eyes and met those of Foran with a look of inquiry. He seemed in one glance to read the fact that the Piedmontese's knowledge of German was imperfect, and that the key to the conversation was wanting to him. He was soon aware also that the Austrian had turned from the door and was surveying him closely, but without any visible effect being pro-"], [22, "14 VALERIA. duced, for neither by look nor gesture did the youth show the slightest conscious ness of the scrutiny he was undergoing. Count Arnhorst turned back to his com- panion. \" These people keep one waiting an intolerable time,\" he said. \" By the way, where did you come from to day?\" \" From Rovigo,\" replied Stadler, \"and glad I was to get away.\" \" Ah ! then I suppose you heard of the little adventure at Buonacella, which has been diverting everyone down in that quarter.\" \"Not I,\" said Stadler, \"I heard of no adventures.\" Arnhorst lowered his voice. Those nearest to him might have heard, had they understood the language in which he spoke, for his intonation, though"], [23, "VALERIA. 15 quiet, was distinct; but to the rest of the company who from time to time cast sour looks towards him, he was probably inaudible. \" Only one of these little escapades in which our neighbours indulge for the amusement of the police,\" he said. \" One of these emissaries who go scattering sedition far and wide was tracked to his lair at Buonacella, and the police almost had their hands on him. Somehow or other he was warned, as always happens, and escaped out of a window as they went in at the door. Well, then there was a hue and cry ; our friend is as nimble as a cat, scrambles over the wall and runs for his life, the police after him.

Let the people pass on first.\" 0"], [26, "18 VALERIA. As the Count spoke, he glanced again at the boy, whose face wore the same unconcerned expression as before. If he had heard the tale he had ap parently not heeded it, and taking up his bag he followed the rest of the passengers who were collecting round the door. Arnhorst lingered behind, so as to allow him to pass, and followed at some little distance till he had seen him enter a carriage, and then the two officers also took their places in the train. They were among the first to leave the station at Venice, but Arnhorst delayed his companion outside, until the other passengers were released from the examination of passports and searching of luggage within. At that time the vigilance of the officials had increased tenfold, and most minutely was every"], [27, "VALERIA. 19 article of the Piedmontese's luggage inspected, while the appearance of the boy seemed to excite considerable suspicion and gave rise to much whispered con versation over a paper which evidently contained a description of some sus pected person. After some delay, the authorities apparently came to the con clusion that the description did not tally with the lad's appearance, and he was allowed to pass, and the passengers filed out to the platform where stood the two Austrians. The youth sprang lightly down the steps, singled out a particular gondola and disappeared be neath the hood. Quick as lightning Arnhorst took his place in another. \" Keep that boat in sight,\" said he to his boatman, \" and follow it closely.\" The man obeyed with alacrity, and 0 2"], [28, "VALERIA. 20 the two gondolas swept down the Grand Canal with every show of speed. But hardly had they entered the smaller canals, than such turning and twisting com menced among a labyrinth of side-cuts, such shooting forward, putting back, going this way and that, that Stadler grew sulky and Arnhorst enraged. It was evident that the gondola was leading them a will-o'-the-wisp dance, and though the vigilant Arnhorst, who kept his eyes fixed on the gondolier of the first boat, could not detect any sign on his part, nor any peculiar in tonation in the oft repeated, \"Ah, stall !\" \" Premi !\" from his own men, which could be construed into a signal, yet he felt that the latter were slacken ing their speed ; they man\u0153uvred awk wardly, lost ground, and finally managed to strand themselves behind a collection"], [29, "VALERIA. 21 of wood-laden boats, through which the pursued gondola adroitly threaded its way, and in a few minutes was lost to sight in the thickening fog. The boatman volubly represented the utter impossibility of having acted other wise.

They denied all knowledge of the boat or its occupants. They did not know the boatman by sight, indeed were sure they had never seen him before in their lives, it was probably una gondola par ticolare, and out of this state of sublime ignorance neither arguments nor bribes could move them.

HE Count Zenar was a man of note in Venice. Though not a Venetian by birth, he had lived many years in Venice and mixed deeply in its politics. He held extreme views, and his house was a hotbed of Liberalism, open however to politicians of all shades of opinion. He was known to have extensive corres-"], [32, "VALERIA. 24 pondence with the advanced Liberals in other parts of Italy, and was one of the most active propagandisers of their opinions in Venetia. He had been con cerned in the rising of 1821, had con cealed, and assisted in the escape of many suspected persons, and his French nationality alone enabled him to remain in Venice. He was a bold and accomplished in triguer; but though violent in his opinions and unscrupulous in his actions, it was not the low cunning of a mean and selfish policy which actuated him, but rather the ambition of a shrewd and power-loving nature which delighted in foiling its enemies with their own weapons. And withal, so clever was he, that in spite of the suspicions of the Government, no treasonable practices had ever been really brought home to"], [33, "VALERIA. 25 him; and when interrogated, he slipped through the fingers of the police like an eel. To great natural ability, he added the charm of a cultivated mind and high polish of manner, and to this much of his success in life was owing. His wife had been an Englishwoman, and had exerted an influence on the education of her daughters which did not end with her life, Ernestine and Valeria were the two children whom she had left behind to comfort the Count, if he had needed comfort; which, engrossed as he was in politics, he scarcely appeared to do after the first few weeks of sorrow were past. Though not an affectionate father, he did not neglect his daughters ; he edu cated them well and highly, studying their characters all the while with the intent to make them useful in the great"], [34, "26 VALERIA. drama which absorbed his life, and by means of their beauty, grace, or talent, to further his own political purposes. Often did he wish that they had been sons, but although only girls, he resolved to make the most of them. \" You will be as welcome to us as flowers at Christmas,\" said the Count, as he greeted his future son-in-law with great cordiality. He was the only member of the family with whom the Marchese Foran was personally ac quainted, for the Count's spare figure and dark sharply cut features were by no means unknown in the salons of Turin. \" What news do you bring us from without ? we live here, as you will soon know, as if we were in a besieged city ; our paternal government is so afraid of our feelings being hurt by what we may hear, that it takes"], [35, "VALERIA. 27 care that we shall not hear anything. My English newspapers, as you see, have undergone surgical treatment.\" He lifted up the paper with a smile, so as to show the large gaps which the scissors had made in it. \" News travels in the air, I think, in these days ;\" answered Foran. \" As I came through the Romagna I found the same stir everywhere, the same ex citement. All take their cue from Rome.\" \" And then you crossed the Po and entered the fog,\" said the Count walk ing to the window ; \" and found a very true picture of the state of things here, a moral fog over the whole people. Well, we must look for a south wind to blow it away. But you have not come here to talk politics, though upon my word it is difficult to talk of any-"], [36, "28 VALERIA. thing else. Let me show you to your room, that is if you can manage to thread the labyrinths of my strange old house.\" The Palazzo San Zeno was indeed a house as favourable by natural situation to plots and conspiracies as any in Venice. Probably in the days of the Council of Ten it had seen much of both; and during the tenancy of Count Zenar, old times seemed to have come again. On three sides it looked into canals, on the fourth was a narrow \"Calle;\" there were three doors to the water and two to the land ; there were windows which looked up and down the street, and across the bridore over the canal ; there were secret stairs, secret hiding-places, a perfect warren of little rooms and passages everywhere. Since that time it has become ruinous and"], [37, "VALERIA. 29 melancholy looking. Grass grows be tween the bricks, the carving of the window pillars is broken, the locks of the water-doors are rusty from disuse, the cobwebs hang thick between the gratings and panes of the lower windows, clothes flutter from the upper balconies, and the first floor is let to a seller of antiquities. The once beautiful and noble palace shared the ruin that fell on Venice. During Count Zenar's occupancy, how ever, all was in order about the old house. The fair face of Ernestine might be seen bending over the flowers in the balcony. No door creaked on its hinges, and though open to all varieties of society, the secrets of the house re mained undiscovered. The brothers Bandiera, whose futile attempt in Calabria had brought them"], [38, "VALERIA. 30 to an early grave, were not forgotten in the Palazzo San Zeno ; Daniele Manin, the clear headed and intrepid advocate whose qualifications for a popular leader were already becoming recognised, was then a welcome guest ; and Nicolo Tom maseo, poet and man of letters, whose earnest Romanism was only equalled by the strength of his patriotic ardour, found in Count Zenar's house eager listeners to those fiery words which earned him from one party the title of \"great orator,\" and from the other that of \" factious demagogue.\" Cesar Foran could not forbear a sigh when he found himself alone in his room. Pleasant and cordial though Count Zenar was, the Marchese could not for get that he had come to Venice to make the acquaintance of his future wife, and the prospect of entering into the bonds"], [39, "VALERIA. 31 of matrimony was very distasteful to him. He was young, and liked his liberty, and his mind was engrossed with politics and war, which loomed darkly on the horizon ; but the marriage had been long ago arranged between his family and the Count, and it must be fulfilled. Ernestine would be an heiress, and the Forans were not rich, so that the alliance was in all ways a desirable one; but he was at that moment inclined neither for love nor marriage. Dinner was laid in one of the smaller rooms, where a stove had been lit all day to keep out the raw chill of the fog, and there the Count presented Foran to his sister, the Marchesa Contarini, who lived with him, and to his two daughters, Ernestine and Valeria. There was no doubt as to the beauty"], [40, "VALERIA 32 of the elder. She had a graceful figure, blue eyes, and an abundance of fair hair, which, combined with the gentle serene expression of her face, gave her the look of one of Bellini's Madonnas. \" She will suit me,\" Foran said to himself, as he contrasted her for a moment with her sister. \" She will be amiable and gentle, and I shall be proud of her.\" Valeria was silent and thoughtful. \" She is not so beautiful by far,\" he thought, \" but there is character and decision in her face. Probably she has been the guiding spirit of the two. That is well. Ernestine will be in good train- ing.' It is rather awkward when you are busy making mental notes upon the character of one of the company, to find the person in question suddenly looking"], [41, "VALERIA. 33 you through with a glance half of inquiry, half of amusement, but wholly of under standing. It was the second time that day that Cesar had encountered such a glance, and he did not like it ; more especially as Valeria's next remark seemed to imply that she had read his thoughts. \" You will find us a curious combina tion,\" she said. \" Our friends always confess themselves puzzled amongst us. One of them the other day compared this house to one of those seaports where Europe, Asia, and Africa seem to meet, all nations mixing and mingling together, so that a stranger never knows in what language he may be answered, and the natives themselves can hardly tell to what nationality they belong.\" \" I know my own people, however,\" said Ernestine, with a smile. \" I know D"], [42, "VALERIA. 34 that I am a Venetian, and that is enough.\" \" And I Italian,\" said Valeria, empha tically. \" We are fusing now, you know ; no more provincial distinction when the country is all one. But I mean to say that the Marchese must make up his mind to meet with every kind of opinion here, and every variety of character, in fact, with people of all sorts. My father shuts his door to none who choose to come, so long as they help to make our society agreeable. No one is compromised by appearing here.\" \" There may be two explanations for that,\" observed Foran. \" Either the Count's views are so well known that there is no room for suspicion, or,\" he added, smiling, \" he is indifferent to all.\" \" I will leave you to decide that point"], [43, "VALERIA. 35 for yourself,\" said Valeria, with a laugh. \" But I must forewarn you that you will find many things here to astonish you. Even the white uniforms find their way to our salon. We do not ask them, but they come !\" \" The fact is,\" said Count Zenar, \" that though we have long ago struck our roots in Venice, we are tant soit peu cosmopolitain. I grew up to youth in the palmy days of the great Napoleon, when men of different nations, different ranks, different turns of thought, met and lived and worked together on common ground. I cannot say much for the real feeling of brotherhood between some of them, but at any rate, the outward barriers were to a great extent broken down. If the Revolution tended to level ranks, the Empire fused races.\" \" To a very slight degree, surely P\" said d 2"], [44, "VALERIA. 36 Cis&r ; \" for the ill-feeling between the various nationalities was surely intensified by Napoleon's wars.\" \" True,\" replied the Count, \" and yet amongst these very nationalities you will find the evidences of a real sympathy with one another. There is the free masonry of Liberalism, for instance, run ning as an under-current through all Europe, to say nothing of the fraternity established by literature, science, or art, as was lately shown by the Congress which met here; and as on these last points everyone can meet on common ground, I open my house to all men.\" \" I am ashamed to own how little I know of these subjects,\" said Foran. \" My time has been so much taken up with other things.\" \" Oh, we will allow you to talk politics"], [45, "VALERIA. 37 to us occasionally,\" said Valeria, lightly, \"under the rose, you know, when our doors are shut, and there are no curious ears to overhear. I assure you that we shall prove good listeners.\" Foran spent the evening in being drawn out. He had a great deal to tell, and it was gratifying to him to be so well listened to, and to discuss the sub ject which was nearest all their hearts, with minds as intelligent and liberal as his own. It was pleasant to see Ernes tine's eager attention, and to find that her observations showed both good sense and good feeling. But when he thought it all over at night, he could not remember anything particular that she had said ; while Valeria's remarks, inquiries, and the intimate knowledge she showed of all the burning questions of the day, recurred to him again and again, accompanied by"], [46, "38 VALERIA. some feelings of surprise. He could not help feeling that when he thought he had been giving information, he had more than once only told her what she knew already. How had she obtained this knowledge? He was not sure, either, whether the frankness which he had shown had met with a similar return. There was much apparent openness and cordiality, but beneath it great caution and reserve. On the whole, he had the uncomfortable sensation that they had fathomed him, while he, on his side, had made but little progress towards ascertaining the real character of his betrothed and her family, and he fell asleep resolving to be more circumspect and prudent for the future. But the next day blew his resolutions to the winds. The fog had cleared"], [47, "VALERIA 39 away, and an autumn sun shone brightly down on Venice. The green water rippled in the sunlight, reflecting every patch of colour from the walls of the houses overhanging the narrow canals, and crossed by the shadows of innumer able bridges. Cesar strolled out by himself, it was rather the Venetians that he wished to see than Venice. Up and down the narrow streets he wandered, streets which never heard the foot-fall of a horse, or were worn by the wheel of a cart, but for ever thronged by a busy moving population ; past the doorways where the decrepid old crones crouch on the doorstep, holding out their long lean hands for alms ; past the piazzas where men stand gesticulating in groups, and boys play pitch and toss as they crouch on the warm stones, and then he paused to"], [48, "VALERIA. 40 watch the gathering of men and women round the mouth of one of the great wells.

Then the crowd disperse, and Foran following one or two of the water-carriers, found himself at last in the Merceria, between the open shops which give such a peculiarly Eastern appearance to the narrow streets. These were gay with stuffs of all colours, and bright with every variety of ware ; and the vendors, standing beside their shops in the open"], [49, "VALERIA. 41 street so as to attract by voice and ges ture the attention of every possible purchaser, were talking and laughing gaily with each other or with their customers. Sometimes, however, there was a silence, a suspicious sullen silence, as a figure in an Austrian uniform passed down the street. It was a slight but expressive token of the intensity of feel ing which lay beneath the apparent mirth of the moment. As he turned into the fruit-market, he observed a Croat soldier, who was buy ing from the basket of one of the women. The contrast was striking. The small, spare, soldierly figure, with the peculiar wide yellow face and short features of his race, and the neat close-fitting brown tunic, vis-a-vis with a dark handsome woman, whose fine eyes and raven locks"], [50, "VALERIA. 42 were set off by the brilliant hues of the handkerchief which she had wound about her head. There was a singular expression of stern gravity on her face as she weighed out the bunches of grapes, standing in the midst of her fruit-baskets with the quiet majestic dignity worthy of a Roman matron. There was not the vestige of a smile, nor did the muscles of her face relax for a moment from its determined gravity as she scanned the foreign soldier and received the money, nor the sign of a greeting as they parted. Not till he had fairly turned away down the street was the lively chatter which she had before been exchanging with her neighbours re sumed. \" Povera gente, lontana da' suoi, In un paese qui che le vuol male,\""], [51, "VALERIA. 43 thought Foran to himself, quoting Giusti's lines on the Croats at St. Ambrogio. \" As hardly used as ourselves, suffer ing as we do from this unnatural state of things, hating and hated. When will it be otherwise ? and who will be the man to restore the glory of the Venetian Republic, or still better, to make her part of that ' Italia Una' of which we dream?\" Absorbed in thought, he mounted the street of the Rialto, and looked out of its central arch over the Grand Canal. Of the many varied associations which throng to the mind of the traveller as he stands on that bridge, he was indeed utterly heedless. On literature and art he had owned himself comparatively uninformed, and the past history was for the moment merged in the present, but the simpatica aspect of the Queen"], [52, "VALERIA. 44 of the Adriatic appealed strongly to his feelings.

As Cesar leant back in the boat which took him back to the Palazzo San Zeno, the soft chant of the gondoliers raised a feeling of sympathetic emotion in his heart, as they sang in their soft Venetian dialect : ' 0 Venezia benedetta Non ti vogio piil lasar.\""], [53, "VALERIA. 45 He almost felt reconciled at that mo ment to his future destiny and his Vene tian bride."], [54, "CHAPTER III. \" Passa una gondola Dalla citta.

Cesar found himself, as before, reply ing to all that she asked, baffled when he himself attempted to question her, and yet without any possibility of his being able to take offence; asking her opinion, listening to her suggestions, wishful for her sympathy, and last, a fatal symptom, wondering what she thought of himself.

The Armenian brother, who was standing beside them, had ceased his conversation with Valeria and the Mar chesa Contarini, and Foran stood also silently and rather moodily watching the dark gondolas which from time to time glided across the lagune, or the slower progress of some heavily laden boat whose tawny sail hardly seemed to serve its natural purpose, so still was the air. \" What a haven of rest it is !\" said Valeria. \"I was just thinking so;\" replied Ernestine. \" Look at the contrast,\" pursued Va leria as if thinking aloud. \" There \u2014 Venice, palpitating with life ; beyond \u2014 Italy, hot with turmoil; behind us \u2014 the E"], [58, "VALERIA. 50 Lido, the only barrier to those endless, restless Adriatic waves ; and here \u2014 here alone \u2014 quiet and calm, like one oasis of peace in a world of unrest.\" \" You speak truly, Signorina,\" said the monk, \" and others besides yourself have felt the same attraction to this spot. The poets Byron and Shelley, of whom you have probably read, found pleasure in this place, not to speak of ourselves who have left the world and our Eastern land for this quiet home.\" He turned to speak to the Marchesa, and Valeria went on in a lower tone to Ernestine. \" Do you see that gondola , making straight for this point?\" she said; \"I have watched it almost since it came in sight. It comes on so swiftly and so surely, like a messenger with some great news, or like the Destiny which we foresee,"], [59, "VALERIA. 51 but cannot escape from ; and we sit here like animals fascinated by a ser pent, quietly watching as it comes nearer \u25a0nearer.\" \" Dear Valeria, do not say such dread ful things,\" said Ernestine, \" I do not believe in Destiny.\" \" But I do,\" answered Valeria. \" There is the channel all tracked out as you see, there is no power of altering the course on which one is once embarked. That boat comes on so fast ; suppose it should drive on the rocks at last ?\" \" Dear child, you are tired, and that makes you think of these gloomy things,\" said Ernestine. \" The boat will turn aside and glide quietly up to the landing place; it will prove a very common place gondola. Don't look at it; look at the mountains which are just begin ning to show themselves above the mists, E 2"], [60, "VALERIA. 52 more beautiful and more peaceful than even the city and the sea below.\" \" You are quite right,\" said Valeria gaily, \"it is a very common-place gon dola ; but my visions of peace have vanished, for the mountains suggest nothing to me but passion and strife, the wear and tear of nature, like storms and avalanches. Signor Marchese, you were born amongst the Alps, I think, have you any love for the hills ?\" \" Undoubtedly,\" said Foran smiling. \" A mountaineer can no more forget his rocks, than the sailor his waves. They are the source of all strength and beauty. Your rivers, your woods, your marbles, do they not all come from the hills ?\" \" Ah well ! I am a depraved mortal,\" said Valeria, springing up, \" for the towns and villages, and the human"], [61, "VALERIA. 53 beings that dwell in them are more to me than all the mountains and seas put together. They are my boundaries, not my home \u2014 Dagli Alpi al mar \u2014 you understand ?\" \" That gondola is coming here after all,\" said Ernestine. As they walked leisurely back along the terrace, tbe boat which they had been watching glided up underneath the Convent wall and paused at the landing place, and an officer stepped out. Valeria paused to speak to the monk, but they were nearly at the gate of the building when Count Arn horst entered the garden and met them face to face. Foran at once recognised the compa nion of his journey, and saw also that the Count was acquainted with his com panions. They greeted him with quiet"], [62, "VALERIA. 54 politeness, and he turned back with them, and attended them to tbe landing place, exchanging the usual civil small talk with the Marchesa. Cesar observed with displeasure that he seized the opportunity, as the path narrowed, to address a few words in a low voice to Valeria. \" I shall have some news for you, when we next meet, Signorina,\" he said. \" There is only one piece of news that I really wish to hear from you,\" replied Valeria. \" What ! are you so well informed of all that goes on ?\" he answered play fully. \" Then I suppose you have heard the story of the nun at Buonacella ?\" \" I have- heard nothing, but I am not at all concerned with what passes in the convents,\" replied Valeria with com posure."], [63, "VALERIA. 55 \" What then is the news that you wish me to tell you ?\" asked Arnhorst with more gravity. \" It concerns yourself alone,\" replied Valeria. They were almost at the boat, but as she turned to bid him adieu, she added quietly. \" When you have made up your mind, you will of course let me know.\" \" Who is that fellow ?\" asked Foran, as they pushed off, with a tone of anger in his voice which he could hardly subdue, though he regretted it when he saw Valeria's flush of displeasure. \" That is Count Arnhorst,\" answered the Marchesa. \" You may often meet him in our salon, though of course I should not wish to be seen much with him in public.

The Count greatly enjoys his society.\" \" His opinions too are more liberal than one would have expected,\" said Ernestine. \" More so than those of a friend of his, I should say,\" said Foran, \" judging from some conversation I happened to overhear in the railway- station at Padua. They were telling a curious story, too ;\" and he repeated the adventure of the nun. \" Do you understand German ?\" asked Valeria, \" for I conclude they spoke in their own language.\" \" Only imperfectly,\" replied Foran, \" but I gathered the drift of their dis- course.\" \" You will have an opportunity of im proving yourself by conversing with these two gentlemen,\" said Valeria, mischie-"], [65, "VALERIA. 57 vously, \" that is to say, if the Count's friend was Captain Stadler, for they often come to our house in the even- >5 ings. \" I wish they did not,\" said Ernes- tine. \" My dear child, it is of the greatest advantage to us,\" exclaimed her aunt in an agitated whisper. \"It is a tacit protection, don't you understand ? The Government can see then that nothing is going on, and for the rest \u2014 \" \" It does not signify;\" said Valeria, \" we are known.\" \" It may be so, but I had rather take one decided line and be straightforward with all ;\" said Ernestine. \" You do not know what you are talking of,\" said the Marchesa hastily. \" My dear Marchese, you are looking at our gondolieri, but I assure you they"], [66, "58 VALERIA. are quite trustworthy ; they are our own people, most faithful and attached to us, there is no fear of their overhearing anything.\" They were approaching the city, which was now glowing in the evening light. The sky appeared as one sheet of gold and orange and crimson towards the horizon, where the sun was just setting behind the purple line of the Friuli mountains, its last rays touching with light every dome and campanile of the city before it slowly sank to rest. Slowly too the soft shadows mounted over the arches of the Ducal Palace, and the long lines of roof and wall, of column and bridge, till the buildings stood out in dark outline against a golden sky. Then a breeze swept over the water, rippling all the quiet surface where the"], [67, "VALERIA. 59 reflections slept so peacefully, lifting the great brown sails, and quietly rocking to and fro the fleet of boats which lay alongside of the Riva dei Schia voni; and then Avith a few strong strokes the gondoliers swept their light craft into one of the numerous Rios, past the Greek Church, past palace and bridge and tall poor looking houses, in and out of many small canals, till at last the gondola paused at the steps of the Palazzo San Zeno. Count Zenar spoke truly when he told Foran that his society was not confined to the circle of his political associates. His foreign birth procured him more freedom from surveillance, and a wider range of guests than could have been accorded either to a Venetian or an Austrian, without incurring the displea sure of his own party. Men of various"], [68, "VALERIA. 60 tastes and pursuits, and of every shade of opinion were in turn to be found at his house. It suited him to stand well with the world, and these meetings enabled him to test the abilities and estimate the calibre of the men with whom, or against whom, as the case might be, his intrigues were directed. Something of this he explained to Foran, so as to account for what might otherwise have appeared strange and suspicious. \" You will understand,\" he said, \"the advantage it is to me to have men of the opposite party coming to my house. Not that the police look a whit less sharply after me, but the world in general, who are not in the secret, give me credit for impartiality or indiffe rence. I am so thoroughly in the con fidence of the chiefs of my own party,"], [69, "VALERIA. 61 that I can afford to put up with the suspicions of the rank and file. Besides there are really many agreeable men among the Austrians, and among them I should have pleasure in introducing you to Count Arnhorst and Captain Stadler.\" But Captain Stadler's place was left vacant that night at the Palazzo San Zeno. Not only did he not come, but he was very differently engaged. Even ing found him walking restlessly about his room, Avith troubled mind and frown ing brow, for hours he had been fighting an inward battle, and the uneasiness of his spirit betrayed itself by his haggard countenance. There was a strife in his mind between good and evil, and though weary of it, he was yet loth to end it as alone he felt it should be ended. Love was striving with honour, interest"], [70, "62 VALERIA. with principle ; he knew what was right, yet desired what was wrong, and the fight was nearly over. This was the cause of his trouble. He had been summoned by the Chief of the Police, and that gentleman had in formed him that his constant visits to the Palazzo San Zeno were known and noticed, and that to maintain friendly intercourse with Count Zenar must make him an object of suspicion, for there was not a plot or a conspiracy in the whole of North Italy in which the Count was not concerned. He was known to hold constant correspondence with the dis affected party in Lombardy, and that no one could visit constantly at his house without becoming a marked man. If, therefore, he wished to advance in the Service, and stand well with his Govern ment, those visits must be discontinued."], [71, "VALERIA. 63 Upon this Stadler fired up, and replied that he felt himself responsible to no one for the choice of his associates, and considered himself under no authority but that of his military superiors. The Director of Police answered quietly enough, that if Captain Stadler wished to hear the same sentiments expressed by his commanding officer, he could soon have an opportunity of doing so ; for his own part, he must look on him in future as belonging to the disaffected party, and consequently as an object of suspicion. Then changing his tone, he urged him as a friend to consider what an obstacle this would prove to his advancement in life. It might lead to his removal from Venice, and would certainly make him ineligible for any post of trust. On the other hand, if he really shoAved himself attached to the Government, he was sure"], [72, "64 VALERIA. of favour and lucrative employment, an able and zealous servant was never neglected, and there was more than one way of proving his devotion to the Emperor. At this moment the Govern ment was most anxious to gain informa tion of the plans and intentions of the revolutionists, and if Captain Stadler could only turn his intimacy with Count Zenar to this end, his visits there would at once be sanctioned by the police. Stadler's sense of honour, and manly feeling revolted at such a suggestion \u2014 he would neither consent to break off his intimacy with the Count, nor yet to retain it with such a purpose, and he left the Director in wrath \u2014 the latter merely observing to him that he knew the consequences of his decision, and mutter ing, as he passed out, something which sounded very like \" fool !\""], [73, "VALERIA. 65 By the time, however, that Stadler had reached his own rooms, his anger had in some degree abated, and left him a prey to the conflict of feelings which well nigh overwhelmed him. He was not a man of high principle, and in this case his feelings were strongly engaged. He had fallen in love with Ernestine. Day and night he could think of nothing but her fair face and sweet smile. In her presence he was intensely happy, and absent from her he cared for nothing, and counted the hours till he should see her again. His life had been spent in the weary and monotonous routine of garrison work ; he was not noble by birth, not genial nor social by temperament, and not very popular among his brother officers. He had nothing which could at all com pensate him in a worldly point of view were F"], [74, "VALERIA. 66 he to throw away his chances of rising in his profession. If he cut off his hopes of employment from the Austrian Government he had nothing to fall back upon, excepting indeed the very slow promotion by seniority in his regiment, and in the higher grades of the army his want of birth would stand in the way of advancement. A civil or staff appointment would open to him the only chance of ever being able to marry, and yet in this case marriage and a good appointment seemed incompatible. Either he must give up Ernestine, or give up his prospects, and in resigning the former he felt he should annihilate both at one blow. There was a third course, and that alone could save him and give him what he so much desired \u2014 he must turn spy-"], [75, "VALERIA. 67 It seemed impossible at first, and to the last it was repugnant, and yet he brought himself to consider it a necessary step, and so pardonable.

Stadler did not go to the Zenars that evening, nor to the Quadri, but late in the night he wrote a note to the Director and sent it early next morning, at an hour when the fog still hung heavy on the canals. The note ran as follows : f 2"], [76, "68 VALERIA. \" Captain Stadler presents his compli ments to the Director of Police, and regrets the misunderstanding of last night's conversation.

There were several guests, but the Marchese Foran was the only one likely to alarm Stadler's jealous fears, and at the sight of him they awoke at once. What should bring him there ? this handsome Piedmontese officer, with neither relative nor friend in Venice, and yet apparently intimate with the Zenars and almost on a family footing ; was it for Ernestine or Valeria that he was come ?

He watched accordingly ; but the sisters were singing together some of the pretty little Venetian airs, and he could not discover to which voice Foran listened to most attentively, or to whose wants he was the most courteously considerate. But when he himself succeeded in gain ing a seat by Ernestine, he was so utterly happy in looking at and speaking to her, and in watching every graceful motion, and listening to every quiet answer, though there was no more in it than tbe most ordinary politeness could dictate, that he almost forgot to observe whether Foran showed any dis pleasure at this conversation, until he noticed that Ernestine herself was apt to glance in the direction where he stood, and to become rather inattentive to"], [80, "VALERIA. 72 Stadler's remarks when she heard the Marchese speaking. There was certainly a shade of displeasure on his face, and something of a sterner ring in his voice. That Ernestine perceived it, and took the first opportunity of changing her place, was evident to Stadler, and his wrath burned furiously ; and yet he fancied that the glance of annoyance which the Mar chese cast towards that side of the room was not directed against himself, but rather sought the spot where Count Arnhorst was sitting, engaged in earnest conversation with Valeria. That half hour revealed to Foran, with the appalling distinctness of a lightning flash, the state of his own mind. That Ernestine might love him was possible, but come what might he loved Valeria. Valeria was in high spirits that even-"], [81, "VALERIA. 73 ing, and she sat Avith Ernestine in her room long after the party had separated for the night, talking over the events of the last few days. \"I do not know why I feel so happy,\" she said ; \" did I not tell you, cara mia, the other day, that the common-place gondola as you called it was an omen of Fate.

With so clear a head and so gallant a heart, I feel sure that he will be a true and staunch ally; an Italian of the Italians.\" \" How is it possible ?\" said Ernestine, \" every sympathy, every feeling must be engaged on the other side.\" \" I do not think so at all,\" answered"], [82, "VALERIA. 74 Valeria. \" Truth and right are even stronger than nationalities ; and he is not a man to take up with new ideas readily.

He was smoking his cigar with the Director of Police, with whom he was on very friendly terms, and talking over with him the political affairs of the day, and the rapid growth of revolutionary principles in the Austro- Italian provinces.

He had sufficient admiration for what was good and noble to have thoroughly mastered its theory and learnt its language, but that it should influence his practice was a thing to which he had not yet been able to bring his mind. His desires soared high \u2014 to be a Metter nich, a Talleyrand, was the object of his wishes ; to understand men, to know their secrets, and have power over them, these were the means through which he sought to advance himself.

The Count took in the whole situation at once. He saw in the suggestion a means of advancement, of establishing a claim on the Government, an opening of which he might fairly avail himself, while his rank and talents would help to disarm suspicion. \" Well,\" he replied, at last, \" there is reason in what you say. Of course if I can be of use, it is not for me to refuse my services. I must however stipulate for absolute confidence, and liberty to use my own judgment as to the means which I employ.

Only the other day I had the appearance of a very suspicious old woman fully described to me by my agents, and she was to be in Venice by a certain train on a certain day. Of course we were on the alert, but there was no one who in the least answered to the account in any possible way.\" \" Are you sure that it was not a boy?\" asked Arnhorst. \" I daresay it was,\" said the Director carelessly, \" these people have endless"], [88, "VALERIA. 80 tricks.

I rely upon you.\" \" And I on you,\" replied Arnhorst, as he took his leave, muttering however to himself, \" I will not have that fellow classing me amongst ' his people,' or considering me at his beck and call ; whatever happens, I shall go my own way and keep my own counsel.\" And Count Arnhorst's visits to the Zenars assumed a more friendly aspect than ever. The Fenice was crowded on Christmas"], [89, "VALERIA. 81 Eve, the opera of Macbetto was to be given, the boxes were gay with Venetian beauties and Austrian uniforms, and there was a dense crowd in the pit from whence rose a murmur and buzz of voices which music could not drown nor police subdue. The Zenars were there ; Ernestine and the Marchesa Contarini in the front, with Foran standing behind them, his eyes fixed on the stage while he strained his ears to catch the words of a low toned conversation which was going on at the back of the box between Valeria and Count Arnhorst.

Was it caused only by the cries and shouts of the crowd, or was it partly o\\Adng to the Avatch he had been keeping over the party in Count Zenar's box, and the jealous hatred aroused in his heart by every movement of Foran's towards Ernestine. For a moment, he detested alike the man and the cause he represented, and a frantic desire to insult him seemed to possess his heart. It is hard to say what dire consequences might not have resulted from an angry word spoken to people so burning with excitement as at that moment filled the theatre ; but that Stadler's eye caught the stern and steady gaze of a man who, with folded arms, leaned forward on the edge of"], [97, "VALERIA. 89 the box which faced him, ready to speak if he had spoken. It was the calm look of authority, and Stadler quailed beneath it. He could not meet the searching expression of those deep set eyes which gleamed from beneath a broad and noble forehead. Though of no imposing appearance, there was something about the man which commanded, nay compelled, res pect, and Stadler resumed his seat in silence. Often in after days did that firm glance and the firmer words uphold law, enforce order, and dictate wisdom and magnanimity. It was Manin. \" Stadler is a fool, he overacts his part,\" muttered Arnhorst to himself, as he witnessed the scene. But Valeria stood with clasped hands and eager eyes till the chorus ceased.

She drew it away in confusion, and hastened to speak of something else. \" Did you see Manin ?\" she asked \" I am surprised at Captain Stadler,\" said the Marchesa Contarini, at this moment turning round. \" I looked upon him as a friend like yourself, Captain Arnhorst.\" \" He is rash and easily moved,\" replied Arnhorst. \" But the Jew, as they call Manin, triumphed completely,\" said Valeria. \" I have heard that name before,\" said"], [99, "VALERIA. 91 Foran starting. \" What is the origin of it?\" \" Oh ! we all have our nicknames,\" replied Valeria with unconcern, \" and Manin, though a Christian, is descended from a Jewish family.\" \" I honour him,\" said Arnhorst.

Foran lingered behind with Valeria, anxious to say a few words to her unheard by the others. \" Valeria, can you trust Count Arn horst ?\" he asked anxiously. \" I believe I can,\" said Valeria. \" I entreat you to be cautious,\" con tinued Foran, \" you cannot forget that he is an Austrian, connected in every way with the ruling party; and he is besides a deep, smooth fellow, he may be playing half a hundred games with"], [100, "VALERIA. 92 you.

She was accustomed to study character, and trusted to her own natural penetration \u2014 forgetting how little that gift can be relied on \u2014 unless accom panied by the experience which time and circumstances alone can give.

Ernestine distrusted the Count tho roughly, but this did not in any wise influence Valeria, for it was more be cause Cesar disliked him than for any other reason.

She began to fear that married life would not bring the thorough understanding and confidence which she had enjoyed with her sister, and was daily working herself into the conviction that Ce\"sar had no love to give her, and would rather have married another. Then she wondered who that other happy mortal could be ? Harassed and worn by these vague surmises, she began to lose that serenity of mien which was one of her greatest charms, and almost wished she were not beau tiful, since it only produced additional mortification, as he, to whom her beauty should have been most precious, cared so little for it.

Time seemed to verify Valeria's opinion of Arnhorst, and Ernestine's of Stadler \u2014 and what a time it was ! a marvellous period of stir and excitement, in which the feelings of all parties were roused to the uttermost, and hypocrisy had a diffi cult part to play. As the year 1848 opened upon Italy, the storm which had so long been gather ing began to break.

These events, followed by the arrest of Manin and Tommaseo at Venice, the insurrection in Sicily, and subsequently by the promul gation of Constitutions in Naples, and Rome, and Tuscany, stirred the popular mind to the highest degree of excitement, which was still further augmented by the news of the Revolution in Paris and the establishment of a French Republic.

Two rival factions had long divided the Venetian populace, the Castellani and the Nicolotti; who taking their names from different quarters of the city, had in periodical fights, games, and latterly in regattas, maintained a long rivalry, not always without bloodshed. No per suasions could induce them to unite and act harmoniously against the Austrians. They could very well hate the Germans they said, without giving up their party; and they refused to be reconciled. Everyone who knows Venice knows the Church of Santa Maria della Salute, standing as it does on the opposite shore to the Palace of the Doges, with a dome rising high against the sky, and broad marble steps washed at the base by the"], [110, "VALERIA. 102 waters of the Grand Canal.

Mass was said for them, the rival chiefs laid down their scarfs to gether on the altar and served as Acolytes to the officiating priests. Then while the Host was elevated they knelt, and extending their right hands towards it, took in silence the oath of peace.

He had come there intending to attach himself in a calm sort of way to Ernestine, he would leave it desperately in love with Valeria. To most people Valeria was the least attractive of the two sisters, but from the first moment that he had met her, and the dark grey eyes had scanned him with their eager inquiring glance, he had been fascinated.

That they should often differ in opinion was only natural. She had been brought up amongst the extreme party ; he by principle as well as connection belonged to the moderate Liberals, but the views he held were those of such men as d'Azeglio, Balbo, Gioberti, and perhaps Valeria had never"], [113, "VALERIA. 105 before had them put so clearly and forcibly before her.

Valeria fascinated him by her eagerness and impetuosity ; he admired her decision of character and force of intellect, and wished earnestly that she and not her sister had been selected for his bride.

Had she been indifferent he could have been indifferent too, with a clear conscience, but to know that he was expected to feel and show devotion to the one, while his whole heart and mind were engrossed for the other, nearly drove him frantic.

If Valeria should love him ! he thought, but no, he knew she cared no more for him than for the clock of St. Mark's, he believed she preferred that fellow Arnhorst ! and he hated the Count. But now his leave had expired, and be bade the Zenars farewell with a sad and aching heart, full of anxious fore bodings. Ernestine looked wistfully in his face as she said adieu, and his heart smote him as it does when one has been harsh to a child, and the stern expression of his features changed to one of contrition, yet kind and affec tionate withal, and the pressure of his hand brought a smile and a glow to her cheeks ; but the next minute his"], [117, "VALERIA. 109 grasp grew cold and his face pale, as with an emotion he could hardly conceal, he turned to Valeria and almost me chanically repeated Ernestine's words, \" Yes, when shall we meet again ?\" \" When the Austrians are beyond the Isonso,\" said Valeria. He did not reply, but turned away and left the house, and as his gondola drifted below the archway, he leaned back with folded arms in utter misery, leaving all he loved most dearly and without a hope on which to anchor his heart. Reaching the station, and at last obliged to rouse himself to secure his place in the train for Milan, he discovered that he was late ; the doors were already open and the passengers flocking to the train, and as he hurried down the plat form he recognised Count Arnhorst before him. At no time was the Count to"], [118, "VALERIA. 110 him an agreeable sight, and at this juncture he felt that his company would be unendurable. He turned hastily aside, and in so doing came face to face with a figure he well remem bered. It was that of the youth who had attracted his notice in the waiting-room at Padua, and who was now strolling along bag in hand, and with his hat rather pulled down over his reyes, with the same composed and nonchalant air which had so well baffled the scrutiny of the officials at their last meeting. The two men entered the same carriage which was the last empty one, and no sooner was the door shut than the youth glancing out of the window to see that no one was near, seated himself by Foran, and leaning towards him said in a low hurried voice."], [119, "VALERIA. 111 \" Listen ! you are going to Milan and you are a patriot, go to Manara, and tell him that whatever happens he may depend on the Greek.

The boy had sunk into a corner and leaned back as if he had been there for an hour, and Foran converted his excited movement into an attack on a stiff window. Not many words of greeting passed between them, and the Count smoked in silence, but the eyes of both turned often to the corner where the boy sat dozing quietly ; at his first movement the Count offered him a cigar, he took it courteously, but it did not lead to conversation for he leaned out of the window and smoked in the open air, conscious all the while that the eyes of the two gentlemen were upon him.

Foran leaned out of"], [121, "VALERIA. 113 the window and detained him for a moment, murmuring in Piedmontese, \" You may rely on me for the sake of the Greek's daughter.\" The last half hour had made clear to him two things. The Greek was Count Zenar, and the boy was Valeria. \" You have dropped this, I think,\" said Count Arnhorst, as Foran resumed his seat. It was the address that the boy had given him, and which in his last hasty movement had fluttered to the ground. Arnhorst looked quite unconscious of any peculiar interest attaching to the scrap of paper he handed him, so that Foran, dismayed as he felt, could only hope the few words on it had not been read, or that Arnhorst had no clue to their meaning. But when the train reached Padua, Arnhorst walked straight to the telegraph office. 1"], [122, "VALERIA. 114 The police in Venice were on the alert that day, and every passenger from Mestre by train or gondola was closely inspected, but when the market-boats came in the next morning from Burano, it did not occur to them to take note of a handsome young gondolier who guided his well-laden craft through tbe canals with all the skill of an experienced oarsman.

The Jewish descent of the latter had given rise to the appellation, and the neighbourhood of Count Zenar to the old Greek quarter and the Greek Church was the origin of his nickname.

But the danger was pressing, and there was no one to whom she could turn for help. She raised her head, and looking across the narrow street to where the fantastic chimneys of the opposite houses stood out so clearly against the blue sky, the contrast of its bright and peaceful expanse Avith the struggle and turmoil beneath smote her painfully. \" The long and short of it is,\" she said, \" that I must go myself.\""], [149, "VALERIA. 141 It had been indeed a rare triumph for Arnhorst to have found the clue to the Milanese correspondence by the discovery of Nicolo's agency.

It only remained for him to discover the password so as to meet that mes senger himself, and this Valeria, in her care for his safety, had unfortunately supplied.

Arnhorst had no suspicion what ever as to who his gondolier had been ; though of Valeria's identity with the boy of the Padua station, and even with the gondolier whose speech had placed him in a dubious position by forcing him to shout for Manin in the Piazzetta, he was nearly sure.

In his perplexity, Stadler betook him self to the Palazzo San Zeno, where he had been wont of late to pour some of his troubles into the ears of Ernestine and the Marchesa Contarini.

He had Ernestine's note in his hand, but he forebore to use it. Face to face with Manin, he needed no further assistance. The Chief of the Republic knew him, and that was enough.
