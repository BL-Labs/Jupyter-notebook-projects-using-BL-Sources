The younger girl, now leaning forward, with a little frown upon her face that is born rather of amusement than annoyance, yet par takes of both, is of fairer skin and brighter hair than her sister, whose eyes are of a dark grey, rather than blue, and whose hair is nut-brown with a tinge of red running through it.

Her nose is a rather saucy little affair, tilting heaven wards, and her mouth one can see was made for laughter. She lifts one slender black-gloved hand, and placing it beneath her sister's chin, turns her face gently to her. Such a beautiful face ! Very like the riante one beside it, yet unlike too.

The little episode is over ; the young man settles his soft hat more firmly on his head, picks up his rod, regards it anxiously to see that no harm has come to it because of that hasty casting of it aside, and disappears once more into the shelter of the cool wood.

It is almost terrible to see so frail a ' tenement of clay ' broken up by such a burst of vehemence ; yet it is remarkable that, while his passion lasts, he seems to grow in strength, and the small fine hand clasping the arm of his chair holds it with a grasp of iron. A fiery soul, which, working out its way, Fretted the pygmy body to decay. ' I have consented to adopt you,' he goes on presently, having subdued himself, his cold voice now cutting like a knife.

Griselda's features having settled them selves into a rather alarming expression, Miss Dysart hurriedly breaks into the conversation. ' If you will permit us,' she says faintly, ' we should like to go to our rooms, to rest a little. It has been a long journey.'

Through the huge dark hall and up the wide mouldy staircase they follow their guide, noting as they do so the decay that marks everything around. As for Mrs. Grunch herself, it is impossible to view her with any sort of kindly feeling. A more for bidding old woman both in manner and feature it would be difficult to produce. Stalking on before them, with never a word to one or the other, they every now and again, at a turn in the staircase or a bend in the gaunt empty galleries, catch a ghmpse of her unpleasant face.

She flings wide a door for the girls to enter, and then abruptly departs without offering them word or glance. They are thankful to be thus left alone, and involun tarily stand still and gaze at each other. Vera is very pale, and her breath is coining rather fitfully from between her parted lips.

'Oh, Griselda, what will be the end of it ? ' says Miss Dysart, a touch of despair in her voice. She sinks into a chair, still hold ing Griselda's hand as if unable to let it go, and looks fearfully around her at the bare, ugly, hideously furnitured apartment. There is indeed something so poverty stricken, so mean, about the whole look of the apartment that her heart dies within her. Everything is bald, bare, comfortless. Yet, through the discomfort, one is compelled to see that once the now dingy bedroom was handsome and well-appointed.

As she speaks she looks up nervously at her sister, who is standing beside her chair, so silent as to be almost gloomy.

' Oh ! don't do that,' cries Griselda, horrified. 'Don't cry on your first coming into a house, it is so unlucky. If you do, you'll keep on crying all the time you're in it. There now ! Cheer up, do. After all they can't eat us, and you have me always, you know.' She seems to think this a balm not to be equalled. 'Uncle Gregory is a Tartar, I confess, worse than father.

This is ridiculous enough, but when it comes to hearing the very words he had said yesterday in that charming wood spoken again within her brain, she grows very naturally incensed both with herself and him. What is it to her what so utter a stranger looks like on certain, or any occasions ?

They are wonderfully alike, the father and son, and yet how wonderfully unlike. It seems impossible that with expressions so utterly at variance so strong a resemblance can exist, yet it is there.

There is neither moustache nor whisker to hide the firm, rather severely cut mouth or the lean determined jaw.

His features are un doubtedly cold, too full of will, of resolve, to be exactly lovable, yet there is something about the whole man that attracts the eye and compels attention. A man impossible to pass over, or, having once known, to forget.

In a vague sort of way she has conveyed to him the knowledge that she feels bound and fettered in this house, crushed by a sense of gratitude due ; that she feels it incumbent on her to be civil to the owners of it ; and that she never ceases to remind herself that his father and he are people to whom she is under deep obligations.

A thought of the hypocrisy of it all, of the pretence of one day, the reality of the next, of the honour done to him, the son, whilst she and Vera are treated with such abomin able neglect, brings the colour to her cheeks, the fire to her eyes.

Dysart, who is eating his dinner with de cided zest and perfect unconcern, suggests himself to Griselda as the very incarnation of selfishness. Of course he knows ; but it is nothing to him. She looks round her and loses herself a little in the touch of fairyland the room presents. It is as it were an echo from the past, a glimpse into the old life when her father still lived, that she hardly knew was dear to her until she had lost it.

Then, as though irresistibly amused at the absurd idea that he could possibly have meant it, she bursts into sudden inextinguishable laughter. When Griselda laughs it is impossible not to join in, so bright, so young, so gay is the sound, and presently Dysart, forgetting that feeling of irritation that has been so strong in him for the past hour, gives way to mirth also.
