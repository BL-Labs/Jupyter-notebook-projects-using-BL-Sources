I really think I have found a romance in real life at last (toys with the let/er). The Colonel, one of poor Papa's old friends, and also one of Mama's old admirers, who, when she had refused him ever so many years ago, vowed to keep single for her sake all his life ; and, unlike the usual run of men, he kept his word ; went to India, and she has never seen him since, although they have kept up a correspondence since poor pa died. Now he has come home, and has brought with him his nephew, a young Lieutenant whom he thinks the world of. I fancy that Mama and the Colonel have been hatching a little plot between them. This came this morning (Playing still with letter) to tell us that this Nephew, Lieut. Hugh May. will do us the honour of calling. The Colonel will make his call later. Now, I have a little plot of my own, too. If he calls before Mama comes home. (Bell rings.) Ah ! there is someone ; I must be off. [Exit Lucy, L Enter Hugh May, _?.. dressed as Colonel, shaky on his legs. He looks round, finding himself alone, straightens himself up. Hugh. I rather wish I had not begun this kind of thing. It seemed very funny when I first thought of it. It does not seem half so funny the closer I get to the joke itself. Wonder whether the old lady will recognise the fraud ! I'm so anxious to see the girl (whom Uncle says I have to marry) without her knowing me. And to get to know how the case stands with regard to the old lady and the Colonel. These widows are the very deuce at times. Ah ! here she comes. I must pretend to be a little deaf. Now for it. (Takes a seat, R.) Enter Lucy, __ (dressed as Mrs. Lake, she starts on seeing Hugh). Lucy (aside). Heav'ns, the Colonel ! Hugh (rising and coming towards her). My dear Madam, this is indeed a pleasure, after all these years we meet again. Lucy (in assumed voice, rising). Yes, Colonel, a pleasure, indeed \u2014 but forgive me, the sight of your face recalls so forcibly, many painful memories that \u2014 that \u2014 Oh ! Oh ! (Sobbing, i"], [10, "8 Hugh (aside). Great C\u00e6sar! she's going into hysterics (Aloud.) My dear Madam be calm, be calm, I beg ot vou. (Assists her to a chair.) Let me call for assistance. (Aside.) If I could only get out of this ! Lucy. Oh, Colonel, do not leave me, I beg. (Aside.) I must not have the servants up here for anything. (Aloud.) I am better now. Forgive me for causing you any alarm \u2014but you have changed so little. You are still so like the gallant man I sent from me, that I was overpowered for the moment. And what have you been doing all these long years ? Hugh. Doing ! my dear Madam ! Bombshells and Bayonets ! I'll tell you what I have been doing. SONG. Hugh. Forty years a soldier I have been, Fighting for my country, fighting for my Queen ! Making English History, carving out my name On the rolls of glory, on the scroll of fame ; Now on half-pay I'm discharged, With a salary small, but a liver enlarged. Bombshells and bayonets ! I've always done my duty, Roasting in a foreign clime for England, home and beauty. Soldiers need be rather tough, They're often overlooked, And stay on foreign service till They're either killed or cooked. Forty years a soldier I have been, Fighting for my country, fighting for my Queen ! Building up the Empire, working for renown, Lifting up my fortunes, knocking others down : Now at last I've earned recall And lucky I am to get home at all. Bombshells and bayonets ! etc. Lucy. Ah ! Colonel, not much time for pleasure then. Do you remember the times we used to have ? The Minuet ? Hugh (sighing). Ah !"], [11, "/ Lucy. And Starleigh Lane, Colonel? (Coyly.) You surely remember Starleigh Lane ? Hugh (aside). I'll be shot if I ever heard of it before. (Aloud.) Oh ! could I ever forget Starleigh Lane. Now, 1 ask you, could I possibly forget it. (Aside.) I've got to go through with this now. (Aloud, with fervour.) No ! my adored one, no ! Though 'tis forty long years ago. Lucy. Thirty-nine, Colonel ! only thirty-nine ! Hugh (with a rush). Still ! Still ! I \u2014 1 remember Sta.leigh Lane. Lucy. So many years ago, yet it seems, it seems but as yesterday. Hugh. Ay, ay I but as yesterday ! DUET AND DANCE. Lucy (rising). Tis many years ago, dear love, Since first we met, In all youth's glad and golden days. And danced the Minuet. Hugh. How sweet the music sounded then, The world before us la)'. In rosy paths, 'tis years ago, But it seems like yesterday. Both. Long, long ago, dear, long, long ago, How the years flow, dear, how the years flow ; Gliding along like life's river away, Yet it seems as a story of yesterday. Hugh. Dear faces we have missed full long, And grieved to miss, Were round us, joined us in our song. And bartered kiss for kiss. Lucy. And we, like times, have changed, dear love. Heads bent and tresses grey. Sweet youth hath fled, long years ago, But it seems like yesterday. Both. Long, long ago, dear, etc. (Leads up to Dance, at the finish Hugh leads Lucy lo a chair.)"], [12, "10 Hugh. Vou have retained all your graces, Madam, and are as young as ever. Lucy. Oh, Colonel, that reminds me, your nephew, why did you not bring him with you ? Hugh. I did \u2014 er \u2014 er, the scamp. Lucy. Where is he then ? Hugh. Just outside, Madam, I ordered him to wait for me. But, Miss Lucy ! where is she? Lucy. Oh ! she is in her room, but I must see your nephew, Mr. Hugh May, first, really, Colonel. Hugh. Bombshells and bayonets ! Your commands shall be obeyed, Madam ; I'll fetch him. [Exit 'Hu'gMj R. Lucy. Now at last I shall have my wish, and see this young Paragon that I have heard so much about. What a strange old gentleman the Colonel is to be sure. I don't think he noticed anything. I myself was wondering if Hugh (singing outside in his natural voice). Uncle ! Lucy. The Nephew ! I hear his voice. Enter Hugh, R. (dressed as Lieutenant}. Hugh, Oh, Madam, is my Uncle here ? I thought I heard him call ; He knew that I was waiting near, Outside the garden wall : And so I boldly stepped inside. Your daughter fair to see, I long to know the beauteous bride My uncle promised me. Lucy. Good youth, a welcome I extend ; Right pleased I am to see The nephew of my kind old friend, Who is so dear to me. But you must wait awhile, before My daughter you ma)- see. Who knows what fortune has in store ? Perhaps it cannot be,"], [13, "y DUET. Hugh Oh, pity my impatience, pray, With ardour I am burning. To see your lovely daughter's face, My longing heart is yearning. Lucy Why what a hasty boy you are! There's time enough, 1 trow. The maxim for a journey far. Is patiently and slow. Patience ! Patience ! Patience ! Patiently, sir, and slow ; That is the way to travel all day, If you have a long journey to go. If you would sue, that's what to do, If she should frown for a while ; Never go rueing, but keep on your wooing, And patiently wait till she smile. Come tell me what your fortune is ? And what your occupation ? And how much money you may have? And what your rank and station ? Hugh Why surely you are hasty now, There's time enough, I trow, When we have plighted vow for vow, So patiently and slow. Patience ! Patience ! Patience ! Patiently, pray, and slow. That is the way, so list what I say, If my fortune and wealth you would know First we must see if she loves me, Then we must court for a trial ; Should all go well, my position I'll tell, But patiently wait for a while."], [14, "12 Hugh. Come, let me persuade you ! I really must see her ! Lucy. Not on anv account until your uncle comes back. Why he has not even introduced you to me yet, nor told me anything about you. Hugh. I am certain he will give me a most exemplary character, and say all sorts of nice things about me. Promise me, the moment he comes back you will fetch your ilaughter down. Lucy. Oh, yes, I promise that. Hugh. I fancy I hear him coming. I'll soon have him up here. [Exit Hugh, _?. Lucy. He has gone. Now is my chance. (Exit Lucy, L.) Hugh (speaking outside as Colonel). Where the deuce have you been, sir ? I have been looking for you everywhere. Now stand sentry, as punishment ; and if you move I'll court-martial you.

My dear young lady, I am charmed to see you. Ah, how you remind me of your dear mother as a girl. Let me embrace you ! A fatherly embrace I"], [15, "13 Lucy (getting out of his way). You are the Colonel, Mama's old friend, I presume ! She led me to understand your nephew would come, where is he ? Hugh. My dear girl ! (Opens his arms as if to embrace her again.) Lucy (teasing him). Now if it was your nephew that asked me, Colonel, I might have very different ideas with regard to him. Hugh. What ! not one little kiss for me Lucy. Certainly not, Colonel. Hugh. My sweet child ! (Aside.) Ah, I recognise the voice, it's all right. (Lucy retreats as he is speaking, locks the door, R., and lakes key.) Lucy. Really, Colonel ! I shall call Mama if you persist in this manner. Hugh (speaking naturally and forgetting his acting). Oh, bother Ma ! My dearest Lucy, I love you. Lucy. You awful old man. [Exit, L. Hugh (making first for the door L. that she has gone out at, and then for the door Rfi). Locked in, by Jingo ! Here's a pretty fix. And the Colonel himself might come up any minute. Never mind, I'll keep it up, and she'll be certain to pretend to be her own mother again, and then Enter Lucy, L., dressed as Jlfrs. Lake. As she advances Hugh retreats, until they change positions, Hugh walking backwards. Lucy. Colonel ! What am I to understand by this conduct of yours. Hugh. That, Madam, I am in love ! Deeply, madly, irrevocably in love with both you and your daughter. Lucy (with freezing dignity). Sir ! Never dare to address me again. Your conduct (Bell rings.) (Aside quickly.) I must put an end to this instantly. Heav'ns, if it should be Mama."], [16, "14 Hugh (aside). Great Scott, that's uncle for a wager ! Lucy (aloud). Sir, don't you think it time for you to end this farce. You are not my old friend the Colonel at all. You are an impostor. Hugh (kneeling). My dearest lady, I admit it, but it was all for love of your incomparable daughter. For Heav'ns sake do not tell my uncle ; he would cut me off with a shilling. Lucy. I must consider, sir ! Let me pass. Hugh. Madam ! I will not leave you until (Bell.) Hugh. Ah! have pity; there's my uncle ! Lucy (trying her hardest to pass him, forgetting). No ! it may be my mother. Oh ! what have I said ! ( Wringing her hands). Hugh (still on his knees). What ! Ah ! ah ! Then you are not your own mother, but the sweetest daughter that ever imposed upon a credulous lover. (Lucy kneeling also.) SCENF AND DUET. Lucy. Oh, forgive me, I implore you, Do unlock that awful door, Hugh. Oh, my darling, I adore you, Listen, and I'll tell you more. Lucy. I'm with sudden fear distracted What a scene would be enacted If my mother caught us here. (Both rising) Let me pass, sir, now directly, Hugh. That I cannot do, I fear ; And I'm sure I shall not do so. Till you say you love me, dear ! (Bell.) Lucy. There I once more the bell is ringing, Hugh. It may ring again for me, Lucy.

It is admirably suited for drawing-room representation. General Blunt, as blunt as his name, who, having \" fought in many battles,\" can't make up his mind if woman or gout be the worst ; Dale, masquerading as his valet, a slave to the tender passiou ; Alice, the General's niece, another victim to Cupid ; and Mrs. Crumpet, the housekeeper, whose pride lay in her oven, for in her days cooks were not taught sonatas by Beethoven, make a charming quartet for private opera. There is genuine humour in ' The Romance ofa Muffin,\" but the gem of the work is the delightful tenor air \"Love's Slavery.\" Mr. Bendall's capable musicianship is conspicuous throughout.

An amusing and tuneful operetta. The story is neatly constructed, the lyrics are charming, and Mr. Bendall's music is just what is wanted ; musicianly without being too deep, never dry, but always melodious aud attractive. We can strongly recommend this operetta to amateurs who possess vocal as well as histrionic talent. It can be acted in the drawing- room, as no elaborate scenery is required. It should be mentioned that the music of Lady Ethel only comprises a tenth, D to F sharp, with an alternative top A at the end ; and that assigned to Lord Arthur also a tenth, C to E, so that it will be seen that it lies well within the compass of either Soprano or Mezzo-Soprano for Lady Ethel, or Tenor or Baritone for Lord Arthur.

A really humorous idea, humorously treated both musically as well as dramatically. The duet between the Tailor's Dummy and the Barber's Lady is distinctly funny and decidedly clever. It is a good idea writing the chorus for either female or mixed voices, as it is thus suitable for the school room, the stage, or even the Theatre Royal back drawing-room. THE ARGUMENT. The early loss of his wife and abduction of his child have broken the Scarecrow's heart. Flora, the Queen of the Flowers, in her great pity for him, endeavours to ascertain the son's whereabouts. By the help of two children he is discovered iu the guise of a tailor's dummy, and in love with Amy Block, the revolving lady from the barber's.
