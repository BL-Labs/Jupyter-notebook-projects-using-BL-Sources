IH\u0152BE found it very trying to set out for Brockcotes by the High Street of Wellfield, either carrying Lord Wriothesley in her train, or being carried in his. Every well-informed native they met stood agape at the familiar faces of Lord Wriothesley and Ph\u0153be Paston seen in con junction and in company with the Halls. The fort}7 Miss Medlars flew in all directions with the news, causing Miss Rowe to tear the night-cap from her head, since she hap pened to be in bed owing to an inopportune attack of jaundice.

It was a very nice dress for the sea-side, though not now strictly appropriate any more than a bathing-machine would be to an inland town like Wellfield. Lady Dorothea could not have been guilty of the inaccuracy. The truth was, that notwith standing Mr. Hall's rapid growth of fortune, his daughters did not travel with the suite and the mails which were the necessary accom paniments of Lady Dorothea. The Halls, therefore, did not alter their toilets by laws as regular as the seasons, and as well de fined as land from water. Ph\u0153be wore her plainest brown Holland, with her common est little hat. Lord Wriothesley appeared in the light-grey suit in which lord and commoner seem to have made up their minds to meet the heat of summer, and min gle indistinguishably save for the certain air that is born and bred. In this dress Lord Wriothesley looked younger, slighter and"], [13, "Another Ordeal. 3 more unapproachable than ever to the out side world. Mrs. Connel had volunteered to be every body's matron ; so that Mrs Paston was not required to break the even tenor of her way by the unusual exertion of walking out for any purpose except that of paying visits. She reserved the glory of going up to Brockcotes with aching limbs and panting chest, till there should be a more express acknowledgment of Ph\u0153be as the future countess. Mrs. Paston was too great a coward to care for facing and defying her old friends Mrs. Bald and Mr. Clarges. Mr. Pas ton did not appear at luncheon, and nobody dreamt of attempting to drag him from his painting-room after Lord Wriothesley had paid his respects punctiliously to the master of the house. The group soon arrived at the Wellfield gate, where they scandalized the rigid pro priety, and fairly transfixed the nimble tongue of Mrs. Chenevix. Ph\u0153be had fan cied that the great ordeal of the expedition would be over for her when she had got e 2"], [14, "Noblesse Oblige. 4 through Wellfield High Street. But she found that her troubles were only beginning. Lord Wriothesley was walking on first with Olive Hall. Ph\u0153be ought to have been en grossed with her labour of love in directing Jane's and Kate's attention to the extent of the Brockcotes park (seen even from an avenue), to the side of the larches and the sycamores, the perfection of the American garden, and the grand pile of building com ing into view as the crown of the gentle ascent. But poor Ph\u0153be's mind was sorely distracted by speculations on the topic of conversation between the couple before her. It was scarcely speculation. Ph\u0153be was morally certain that Olive would be apply ing the principles of landscape-gardening, as exemplified in the four acres of ground round Garnet Lodge, to the disadvantage of the park at Brockcotes, which was more than double the number of miles in circum- ference. Further, Olive would be giving Lord Wriothesley the benefit of her opinion on woods and forests in general, and the game laws as a statute in connection with"], [15, "Another Ordeal. 5 them. She did not hesitate to give her opinion, and was not hampered by small considerations of the limited opportunity she might have had in forming it, or the biassing circumstances amid which it might have been formed. The Latimers belonp-ed to the great Liberal houses, and were a time out-of-mind authority at Brooke's and the Reform Clubs. Lord Wriothesley was even suspected by his friends of going as far as Radicalism, \u2014 an inclination which he might be following out in his personal relations. But it was not likely that he should hold the advanced opinion entertained by the daughter of a Folksbridge merchant on the game-laws. The great gateway did not fall and crush the part)7. Mrs. Bald, whatever might have been her bearing to them under other lead ership, deferred to the presence of the son of the house. She came out to receive the visitors, followed by a housemaid to carry the keys and a footman to shut the doors behind her. Mr. Clarges hovered between the doors of the buttery and his private"], [16, "Noblesse Oblige. 6 apartments, not coming too prominently forward, yet not denying Lord Wriothesley's right to command his attendance should he also be wanted. Mrs. Bald was a handsome, middle-aged woman, large in every way, and with the double chin which is becoming in a house keeper and a hostess. She could have tucked up the Countess like a baby in the skirt of her brown silk (Lady Exmoor did not insist on a black one) ; and her respect for the Countess, who did not stammer above a sentence once a week to her house keeper, was unbounded. Mr. Clarges wore his hair in the old fashioned tufts at the side, and the style of whiskers adhered to by the Earl ; only Mr. Clarges's hair was much more luxuriant. He dressed, too, very much as the Earl did of an evening. But although Mr. Clarges was a gentlemanlike, elderly man, with some thing of a military carriage, he had never been mistaken for his master in his life. He would have looked daggers of scorn at the man who should have been foolish or inso-"], [17, "Another Ordeal. 7 lent enough to have made so gross a mis take, or pass so scurrilous a jest. Ph\u0153be wished she had not been forced to suspect a double meaning and a severe cen sure beneath the elaborate politeness and the unbending gravity with which Mrs. Bald courted her recognition and Mr. Clarges shunned it. Mrs. Bald responded to her questions by keeping the whole company, including Lord Wriothesley, waiting, while she made pointed and audible inquiries after Mrs. Paston's health as that of an equal and acquaintance. All the time Mrs. Bald's mouth did not once relax into a smile. Ph\u0153be had always known her as a grave woman, affected by the dignity of her office ; but her present gravity was portentous. It was not pleasant to have a declaration of war covertly but clearly proclaimed, and to be conscious of an immediate necessity for reading in the eyes of the old servants the condemnation of the unsuitable selection Lord Wriothesley had made. Though the condemnation was hidden from the Halls, and only perceived to be rebelled against"], [18, "8 Noblesse Oblige. by Ph\u0153be and Lord Wriothesley, it was certainly not agreeable to her. The going over the great house, suite by suite and corridor by corridor, began. Then Olive's inquisitiveness and self-sufficiency, and the ignorance of all the sisters, became conspicuous. Not that any one of the Halls was exceptionally ignorant ; only the know ledge which was Brockcotes knowledge was strange to them. The language spoken there, whether or not it was a shibboleth, was foreign in their ears. Olive, especially, had a fundamental want of reverence in her mental constitution, which caused her to see nothing in the old guard-room and banquet ing-room beyond musty apartments which were so many feet in length and breadth. She \"loved to be particular\" in ascertaining dimensions, in order that she might tell the party that the Queen Anne's parlour was not an inch bigger than the back drawing room at Garnet Lodge. She was strong on the superiority of modern accommodation. How could people have lived in such dark rooms, with such hard seats and bare boards ?"], [19, "Another Ordeal. 9 What a rude, uncouth life it must have been ! Why, a modern mechanic's cottage was better in many respects. \" Do you not think one's ancestors could endure a few hardships in the centre of this, Miss Hall?\" suggested Lord Wriothesley, pulling aside the faded window-curtains and looking out on the wide park, with the spreading oaks and sweeping beeches, and the open bountiful country beyond. \" I daresay they never looked at it,\" de clared Olive, \" though they hunted its deer and ate its beeves. What did they hear of the beauties of nature and of scenic effect ?\" \" Not hear \u2014 but feel. Don't you think so, Miss Paston?\" maintained his Lordship. \" Oh, if you appeal to Ph\u0153be, she was brought up under the shadow of Brockcotes, and in the faith of Brockcotes \u2014 down even to caring more for that little puppy dog of hers which came from Brockcotes, than for all the men and women past the pale of cousins in Folksbridge. She is as bigoted a Tory as you could find,\" Olive wound up, changing the natural end of her sentence,"], [20, "Noblesse Oblige. 10 conscious that she was venturing a little too far. But Lord Wriothesley only laughed light ly. \" I accept the inference. I am quite willing to be counted a Tory and a tyrant, if only Miss Paston will abide in the faith of Brockcotes ; though I foolishly thought we were Whigs, and that I was the whiggiest member of the family, and, upon my word, rather a fellow of the period.\" But Olive, undaunted, proceeded as if she were taking stock of Brockcotes, and putting down at the lowest figure worn Turkey carpets, faded satin couches, with \"fleur-de lys in black velvet and gold.\" After all, she showed her trade extraction by her keen in terest in judging the market-value of every article, and in tacitly proving to her own satisfaction, that although there was a great collection, there was nothing (unless the pictures, the books, the china, the plate, and the jewels, of course, and a few cabinets and caskets) which was intrinsically worth a larger sum of money than the rich mer chants of Folksbridge \u2014 the Clays, for in-"], [21, "Another Ordeal. 11 stance \u2014 could pay for their fancies. She held that it was a mere delusion and rem nant of feudalism, which filled the Brock cotes' visitors' book. The Halls had not come on a visitors' day, but by private favour, and attended by Lord Wriothesley, as Olive, leveller though she was, would not fail to mention incidentally in her set. She was assured that whenever occasion offered later in the season, Mrs. Bald's deputy was often engaged from morning till night on the visitors' days with the crowds that came from far and near. Ph\u0153be tried to awaken Olive to the real interest of many of the treasures, and Lord Wriothesley did not fail in his duty. He brought out a fragment of the translation from the Greek Gospel of St. John, in Prin cess Mary's own handwriting. Olive impugned the authenticity of the manuscript, standing out stoutly, and bran dishing her thorough acquaintance with the outworks of history. Bloody Mary help a Protestant version of the Bible \u2014 certainly not. She could not swallow that. There"], [22, "12 Noblesse Oblige. was no use in telling her that the same Mary had also supplemented the Dutch Reformer, Erasmus, in the Psalms. She was as fully convinced of her superior correctness in an nals appropriate to some spoils of the Civil War, with which her unexceptionably found ed and digested information would by no means fit in. \" I believe the Boscobel Papers favour our story,\" Lord Wriothesley hinted, modestly. Olive had not happened to hear of the Boscobel Papers, and directly said so, with a dogmatism in her tone, which signified that, in consequence, they did not deserve to be heard of. And later down in the ages, Olive was still more at fault. Listening and pondering on the different language and ideas spoken and expressed by Olive Hall and Lord Wriothesley, it seemed to Ph\u0153be that she beheld an exaggeration and caricature, but still a likeness, of the same incongruity where she herself was con cerned. She did not mean to say that it was all superiority on the part of Lord Wriothes ley and his class ; she was not so subservient"], [23, "Another Ordeal. 13 as this would imply. It was enough that there was a difference, and the smattering which she had got of aristocratic speech and ways only opened her eyes to see the dis parity. There was a gulf, artificial, no doubt, but still sufficiently wide, between Ph\u0153be and Lord Wriothesley, which nothing but love true and deep could bridge over safely. Olive was fretted by being found at fault ; and Jane and Kate were wearied of wander ing through labyrinths. The inspection of the pictures was hurried over, \u2014 and Ph\u0153be was glad of it. None of the Halls \u2014 not even Kate, who drew indifferently well, nor Olive, who had a halting ambition after art \u2014 could admire a picture except for the merest feat of execution, for glaring effects and sensa tional strokes, or for stereotyped pasteboard picturesqueness. Ph\u0153be had suspected it before, by seeing her father wince under her cousin's comments, especially under their commendations in his painting-room that morning. The Halls, in virtue of their woman's na ture, revived a little when, in the charter-"], [24, "Noblesse Oblige. 14 room, not charters, but jewelled collars, richly-set swords, silver-gilt basins and ewers, were submitted to their inspection. The ladies consented to do homage to the great glittering drops of the Exmoor neck lace. But even here the abbreviations and the illusions which Lord Wriothesley inno cently made, were a mystery to them. The SS collar was anything to them but the col lar of the Golden Fleece \u2022 green velvet bags did not necessarily refer in their minds to secretaries of state, or white wands to grand chamberlains, or gold keys to lord high treasurers. Even red and blue ribbons were not, without fail, allied to the Star of the Order of the Bath, and the George of the Garter. \" Weren't you always told that it was low to employ nicknames ?\" whispered Kate to Ph\u0153be, in considerable confusion. Kate was connecting the SS collar and the white sticks with the Coos, the Bullies, the black Finches, the white Hares, starvation-Dundas, and single- dance Lady Bell, whom Lord Wriothesley had gliby cited in illustration"], [25, "Another Ordeal. 15 of their contemporaries among the family pictures. But Ph\u0153be only said, \" Haven't you an idea now what it is not to have a grand father?\" \" We all have the gardener Adam to fall back upon,\" interposed Lord Wriothesley, who had been within hearing of Ph\u0153be's answer. \" Indeed, we are a little nearer gardeners. You noticed ' Charming Nancy' Lady Exmoor ? She was Nancy Reeves, the home-bailiff's daughter.\" Then there had been one low marriage in the Exmoor family. Ph\u0153be opened her eyes. \" I have heard of ' Charming Nancy ' Lady Exmoor, but I did not know she was a bailiff's daughter,\" she observed. \"We don't speak of her as such,\" Lord Wriothesley -replied readily. \"We have preferred to incorporate her with ourselves, and to count her charms to our own credit. You observe we don't forget the charms, Miss Paston, but are proud to own them to this day.\""], [26, "Noblesse Oblige. 16 Mrs. Bald could hold her tongue no longer. \" That was only a story, my lord, got up by our enemies,\" she remonstrated, with a toss of her head. \"If it ever did happen, which I don't say it did, it was in the days of some of them troubles \u2014 I forget which \u2014 when the man Reeves rendered important assistance to my Lord as then was.\" \" When are there days without troubles, Mrs. Bald?\" Lord Wriothesley questioned, to tease her. \" I am sure I don't know such days, or days when assistance is not wanted. I daresay, now, Reeves took in my great-great-grandfather when he was a little sick of the trouble of living, and of himself, as the greatest trouble of all. I have a notion old Reeves brought old Ex moor into contact with fresh goodness, and so did him good. Naturally Lord Exmoor would not forget the source of the good ness, but would want to have it, and would have it too \u2014 what should hinder him ? \u2014 as a perennial spring in his heart and house. De pend upon it that was the story, Mrs. Bald.\""], [27, "Another Ordeal. 17 \"What affectation these fine gentlemen have, one way or another !\" Olive took oc casion to say aside to Ph\u0153be. \"What a piece of make-believe it is for Lord Wrio thesley, born with a gold spoon in his mouth, to speak of the trouble of living, as if he knew anything about it !\" \" Don't you find it a trouble to live as you ought, Olive ; and you were born with a silver spoon in your mouth ?\" Ph\u0153be re torted, taking Lord Wriothesley's part be hind his back. \" Isn't it a Christian's life to have a battle to fight ?\" \" Oh ! yes, if you are going to put it in that way,\" protested Olive. \" But, of course, he meant nothing serious.\" \" Why nothing serious ? The Exmoor family are the most in earnest of any people I know, unless it may be papa in his art.\" \" My dear Ph\u0153be, you are infatuated about the Exmoor family.\" At that home-thrust, and in horror lest Lord Wriothesley should hear more like it, Ph\u0153be was silent. The work of seeing Brockcotes was so VOL. III. c"], [28, "Noblesse Oblige. 18 heavy, that Mrs. Bald's unquestioning pro vision of tea, fruit, and wine, in the library, was not only acceptable, but, as Mrs. Connel thought, imperatively needed. Olive's spirits rose too. Not that she was physically ex hausted, but that the tea was Twining's tea, neither more nor less, which the Halls always used. There were slices of ordinary bread and butter, Mayduke cherries and straw berries. The fruit was not so much better and earlier than what the Halls could pro duce at Garnet Lodge. There were cer tainly ices on the table, and the Halls would not think of sending for ices on a moment's notice, though they lived within half a mile of their confectioner. Olive did not pretend to be a judge of claret and madeira, but she understood that very light wines were in ordinary circulation in a house like Brock cotes, and she believed Lord Wriothesley made the most of these before the company by calling the one his father's claret and the other his mother's madeira. Olive's lynx eyes detected club-books in common bindings on the table ; so that, not-"], [29, "Another Ordeal. 19 withstanding the dignity of oaken book shelves round and round, tier on tier, and Russian leather stamped with the Latimer crest, she was relieved and gratified to think that the Exmoors had their literature from public libraries like other folk. She proceeded to put Lord Wriothesley \u2014 who, she owned, was good-natured and civil in doing the honours of his house \u2014 through an examination on the pursuits of his family. He submitted with patience and gravity, and only afforded glimpses of amuse ment to Ph\u0153be at intervals. Was Lady Dorothea very musical ? Did she play on the harp as well as the piano ? Was she a fine player ? she asked almost wistfully, aware of her own defects of ear and taste, but remembering that she had Kate's pro ficiency to fall back upon. \" Well, I can't say,\" his Lordship answer ed, with strange uncertainty. \" Would you say Dora was very musical, Miss Paston? She likes the Opera, I know, and is always wanting a fellow to see her to her box ; but then she likes the theatre, too, when Kean c2"], [30, "Noblesse Oblige. 20 or Fechter or Helen Faucit makes a house. But as to playing on the harp, I'm sure of that, for she could never be taught to tune it. She has' not much time to play on the piano. After all, you know when she is desperate for music she can get far better performers, professional artists, than ever she could be as an amateur.\" Olive experienced a sense of consolation, and, at the same time, she felt bewildered, for although she did not confess it exactly, she had been accustomed to associate per sonal proficiency in music and the fine arts with refinement. She recovered herself by declaring decidedly, \" She cannot have any musical talent ; if she had, she would find time for its development. She must have her time at her own disposal.\" \"Has she, Miss Paston? Poor Dolly! She has got all the women's part of the family correspondence to keep up, since mamma's wrists have failed ; and the heaviest end of the company in the house and of the visiting to carry on. She must ride with the Earl and drive with the Countess, and be at my service whenever I choose to want her."], [31, "Another Ordeal. 21 She has to hear one-half of the appeals of refractory subjects, and to attend to three fourths of the requirements of applicants and pensioners. She says herself that the height of the London season is comparative rest to what she must be up to in the coun try. She may have grown fat at Wiesbaden, but I expect that her hair will be grey be fore she goes to do Fairchester's business.\" \" You will excuse me for saying it, Lord Wriothesley, but there must be a great defi ciency in organization and management somewhere, and a great waste of time in this house,\" said Olive, as she smiled on him con descendingly. \"Yes, my good woman, there must,\" she went on, nodding to Mrs. Bald, who stood confounded at this mercantile young lady's unutterable conceit and impu dence. Miss Paston would not have done it. Miss Paston was another sort of a young lady ; but these ladies were her connexions ; and to think that there ever should be a word of their becoming the family's connex ions, instead of the Fairchesters, the Dug dales, the Dudleys ! It was enough to make a strict churchwoman swear. In the mean-"], [32, "Noblesse Oblige. 22 time, Olive went on to lecture Lord Wrio thesley comfortably, while she sipped his Twining's tea, and ate his ordinary bread and butter. \" You must believe that we have company \u2014 see a great deal of it, in fact, at Garnet Lodge. I take an interest in my clergy man's religious and philanthropic schemes. I assure you we are not heathens in Folks bridge. I am a member of several societies; indeed, I am the secretary of one, besides being a district visitor. But we get through so much by method and system. I am afraid Lady Dorothea must stand sadly in need of a lesson in system. She must fritter away her days playing at being the Lady Bountiful of her parish, which is apt to be the fault of country ladies.\" \" I daresay we should all be the better of lessons from Folksbridge in many things,\" answered Lord Wriothesley meekly; \"but is there not something to be said for our in fluence being peculiar, and for the advantage of personal contact ?\" \"I don't see it,\" said Olive. \"As for"], [33, "Another Ordeal. 23 riding with the Earl, and driving with the Countess, these are family arrangements ; but cannot Lady Dorothea trust her father and mother alone ? Are they not fit to take care of and entertain themselves ?\" \"To hear you, Olive, one would think that you had no natural affection ; yet what daughter could have been more devoted than you were to Aunt Hall in her bad ill ness two years ago ?\" urged Ph\u0153be despe rately, by way of diversion. \" When mamma or papa is ill, that is ano ther matter,\" observed Olive, carelessly. When Ph\u0153be thought of it, she was forced to admit to herself that the young Halls, without any radical want of duty or attach ment, had drifted away from their father and mother in their pursuits and tasks. Mr. Hall was a very indulgent father, but it bored rather than pleased him to have his daugh ters' company in his carriage to and from his office. What did they know of stock, of consign ments and prices, with which his mind was busy. Notwithstanding that Olive asked"], [34, "Noblesse Oblige. 24 tiresome questions, she did not enter into the matter, nor did her father really wish her to do so. Mrs. Hall, though she had more originality and force of character than any of her daughters, could not follow Kate in her classic music, nor Olive in her societies and sciences, nor Jane in her gentle pauper ism, and unlimited privilege of grumbling. \" Is Lady Dorothea a first-rate artist ?\" cross-questioned Olive, returning to the charge ; \" I mean, does she draw and paint well, \u2014 for you call musicians artists ?\" \" No, not a bit first-rate,\" proclaimed Lord Wriothesley, frankly. \" She sketches with wonderful speed and satisfaction to herself; but as to the correctness \u2014 I say she should have damages from Paston.\" \" Did you ever hear anything so rude \u2014 to say that before Ph\u0153be ?\" whispered Mrs. Connel to her sister Kate. \" But I don't think he can mean it,\" re plied Kate, with a bright idea ; \" for he and Ph\u0153be seem quite good friends, though they hardly say a word to each other.\" **I wish Walter were here!\" exclaimed"], [35, "Another Ordeal. 25 Mrs. Connel aloud, as she threw herself lan guidly back on her chair. \" I am ready to die with fatigue. I really think I should not have come.\" \" I really think you should not,\" acquiesced Olive, dryly. \" It is a pity that you did not discover that in time, Jane, as well as in the case of the other blunders you have made in your life.\" Jane possessed but a moderate amount of self-restraint at any time, and little or none when, as now, she was in a state of physical exhaustion. She became almost hysterical in openly rebutting what she took to herself as Olive's intended sarcasm. \" Now, Olive, you mean my marriage with a poor man, and what I gave up when I accepted Walter Connel. You need not contradict me. And I will not be spoken to in this way. Nobody can say that I re pine at the step I took. Did you not hear me wishing Walter were here ? And really it is high time he were here, when his wife is so spoken to by her own sister.\" \" It is time we were going home with you,"], [36, "26 Noblesse Oblige. Jane ; that is what it is time to do,\" asserted Olive, with exasperating superiority and cool ness. \" We must give up the gardens on Jane's account, as usual.\" Ph\u0153be was only eager to end a scene which was covering her with mortification. Olive and Jane did not dream of her feelings amidst this little revelation of the weakness and asperity in which they were in the habit of indulging. Ph\u0153be was unsuspicious of another ob ligation which was to be incurred. Lord Wriothesley would see her and her friends home, and, in consideration of Jane's in valided condition, he found it no more than common humanity to offer her is arm. Half recovered by the elation of leaning on the arm of the son and heir of a great peer, she chattered all the way of her sufferings, her feelings, and her sacrifices in exchanging Garnet Lodge for Pembroke Crescent. The cavalcade thus retraced its way after Mrs. Bald had had herself put to bed with rage, shame, and \" a bad head ;\" and after Mr. Clarges had gone out riding to recover his"], [37, "Another Ordeal. 27 composure and set his appetite to rights for the second table and its whist in the evening. The Wellfield gate and Mrs. Chenevix's twinkling hostile eyes at length were passed. The stares cast at the group in the Wellfield streets were encountered and surmounted. Ph\u0153be and her cousins were in Wooers' Alley, at Mr. Paston's door, with Lord Wrio thesley lifting his hat, and taking courteous leave of them, while he promised himself the pleasure of sending over to inquire for Mrs. Connel before she should leave next morning.

IHE family were at Brockcotes again ; but Ph\u0153be did not like to realise the fact, and dreaded to meet Lady Dorothea. The Latimers, on their side, viewed the inevitable encounter with not a little concern. Some one had been so faith ful as to communicate to Lord Exmoor the fact that Lord Wriothesley had compro mised himself by the constancy of his as sociation with the Pastons \u2014 not forgetting to hint at the reports which were in cir culation. But so hazardous was the com munication, that nobody ever owned to having made it. It was generally sup posed either to have been the rector, Mr. Gilbert, himself a remote off-shoot from"], [39, "A Family Conference. 29 the Latimer tree, or Mr. Simmons, my lord's own man. Most probably it was Mr. Simmons, as he came nearest my lord, and, in course of long years of inti mate intercourse, could use the most free dom with him. But whoever told Lord Exmoor, there was no question about his being cut up by the news, incapable as he was of ap prehending any further evil than the scandal of an unsuitable coupling together of names and ranks. Yet the mortifica tion to a young Wellfield lady, the injury to her feelings and prospects, and withal the delay in the desirable matrimonial settlement of Lord Wriothesley, combined to vex and annoy him. And Lady Doro thea saw the matter in the same light as her father. Although it was Ph\u0153be \u2014 poor little Ph\u0153be \u2014 who was the victim, Lady Dorothea never hesitated for a mo ment in decreeing that she should be the victim, nor even doubted Ph\u0153be's reluc tant consent to be the victim.

It might be supposed that the little withered, deaf old woman, who figured so poorly in the eyes of the world, and bulked so largely in those of her family, agreed with her husband and daughter, since she said nothing against their con clusions. But as she sat there, with the swollen joints of her small fingers folded over each other, the lines in her sallow face grew more sunken, and she looked from the one face to the other, keeping her own counsel, though she was all the while ready to give the decisive vote in the discussion. One morning, soon after the family's return, there was a consultation in the breakfast-room over the unfortunate affair.

Instead, therefore, of speaking to Lord Wriothesley in the meantime, Lord Ex moor adopted the safer and more agreeable course of consulting with the Countess and Lady Dorothea, making his complaints to them, and confiding his troubles. \" It is abominable trifling in Wriothesley, this : I should not have expected it of him,\" groaned the Earl, showing a large degree of fussiness, instead of the gentleman-like restraint which was habitual to him.

No good-natured sufferance of Wriothesley, when he was low and ailing, should have blinded him to Miss Paston's inter est.

If it was in Wriothesley to look below him in rank, and run headlong into an unfortunate attach ment, all that my private friendship for Ph\u0153be Paston can have had to do with it must have been to prevent his throwing away so much of his life on an unworthy object.

The Earl knocked under immediately, with an announcement that he would himself call on Paston, stand in the painter's studio, and look him in the face, and not betray the least consciousness that there was anything wrong. The Countess issued a simple caution. \"My dear, you won't increase the inti macy, or bring it more prominently for ward; because, although I believe Miss Paston is a good, sensible girl, that might serve only to mislead her and the public further.\""], [47, "Trials on the Way. 37 CHAPTER III. Trials on the Way. |ADY DOROTHEA, that very summer afternoon, left her horse and groom somewhat ostentatiously in the Wellfield High Street, and walked up Wooers' Alley, meaning to say, by every motion of her whip and wave of her skirt, \" See, Brockcotes has not withdrawn its countenance from Wooers' Alley for a single day, and does not deign to be offended, in spite of all its Wellfield peo ple's stupid misrepresentations.\" Lady Dorothea just missed Ph\u0153be, who had gone down with little Bess among the newly-mown hay of the town-meadows. It was a malapropos accident ; for Lady Doro thea had an engagement next day which"], [48, "Noblesse Oblige. 38 would prevent her seeking her friend then, or for several days to come ; and she had much to talk over with her, though it would not be with regard to Lord Wriothesley and his philandering. There might be delicate allusions to that utter embroilment, and gentle warnings against it ; but there could hardly be a more strict approach to it, even between chosen friends. To get the sym pathy to which she was accustomed and en titled, and at the same time to prove to the whole Wellfield world that she did not dis trust Ph\u0153be Paston, and that she was per mitted by Lord and Lady Exmoor to go to Ph\u0153be as usual, was Lady Dorothea's object. So there was nothing for it but that Maho met must go to the mountain. Ph\u0153be must repair, as of old, to Brockcotes, and to Lady Dorothea's room, or to some one of her fa vourite haunts in the gardens or the park. There was no fear of any encounter with Wriothesley, though he was at home. He was not an idle young man at large. His sister could reckon on the portioning out of his time, and the disposal of his day, as she"], [49, "Trials on the Way. 39 could on her father's. Neither would Lord Wriothesley intrude unbidden on Lady Doro thea and her friend. So she left a message for Ph\u0153be, desiring her to come up, without fail, within a few hours, to Brockcotes. Ph\u0153be, when she returned, panted and quivered at hearing this, and pulled herself up sharply for her distress. What harm had she done ? Why should she tremble to meet Lady Dorothea because Lady Dorothea's brother, without enticement, and in the teeth of strong objections and strict reserve, had cast admiring eyes on her? She was not undeserving of that distinction and devotion which, apart from Lord Wriothesley's rank, was already raising the girl in her own eyes and those of her neighbours. Her trembling, womanly softness and timidity, the frank protest of her innocence, the warm throb of her sisterly affection for Lady Dorothea, con tended with each other within her as she took the well-known way to Brockcotes. There was no occasion for her to seek a by road or a back-stair to the grand pile of building on the height. She had done no-"], [50, "Noblesse Oblige. 40 thing which should cause her to sink into the earth should she chance to come into the presence of the Earl and Countess. Truly she could not help asking herself how would it all end ? Should she ever walk or drive in the Wellfield avenue as the honour ed mistress, and not merely as the privileged companion ? Ph\u0153be had been cited to a five o'clock tea-drinking, as it was now the first week of real midsummer weather after a rainy season. Lady Dorothea had arranged that they should enjoy the splendour of the summer, and the fragrance of the tea in her Ladyship's own root-house, where the couple had hundreds of times nursed dolls, rehearsed dinners, and read stories and poetry together, in what they were at present inclined to regard as their tender childhood and youth, before they knew what it was to live and contemplate reverses or awake to ambitions.

The gardens had been planned and planted in succession by heads of the house of Ex moor during the course of generations. Lady Dorothea had the chart at her finger-ends \u2014 wildernesses, pleasances, Italian terraces, Dutch beds, and French Bos quets. She liked better to walk without weariness or breaking down over their long miles on miles, doing their honours and explaining their tokens, than to supersede Mrs. Bald and her subordinate in the show parts of the house. Ph\u0153be had accomplished entire divisions of the circuit with Lady Dorothea. \" These are Lord Exmoor's cypresses,\" she would point out ; and the reflection would be, \"they are not so well known as Lord Weymouth's pines, still they are a distinct variety.

Lady Dorothea's early i^enchant for this root-house had been revived by its prox imity to the field of one of her most recent achievements. The root-house stood on a little half waste ascent, connecting the last flower-garden and the first of the stretch of kitchen-gardens, with their ranges of hot houses. In her precocious practicality, Lady Dorothea had loved to hover on the brink of homely vegetables and fruit-trees. In her present propensity for reforming and regulating, she had taken to improving the waste spot in the large tract of cultivation. She had caused the grass to be trimmed a little nearer to the lawn standard, and the straggling seedling barberry bushes and thorns to be cared for. The channel of a little stream, which had formerly struggled half choked through an accumulation of rub bish and nettles, had been deepened and cleared. For rubbish she had substituted a rock or two, and for nettles some hardy"], [54, "Noblesse Oblige. 44 ferns, such as throve below Mrs. Wooler's laburnums. She had ordered and worked at the transformation with her own indefa tigable hands during many a spare moment. In the end, with her command of the mag nificent Brockcotes park, she was as proud of her hundred yards of scrubby woodland (which she called her New-found-land) as any child of its toy. The maid Thorpie had been appointed to look out for Miss Paston, and to conduct her to Lady Dorothea's retreat. Thorpie, with her coquettish frizzed hair, and flut tering ends of muslin and ribbon, was of the same age as Ph\u0153be and Lady Dorothea, and had been about Brockcotes ever since she was a child. Ph\u0153be had a vague notion that Thorpie ought to be to her, by another step in the social grades, what she was to Lady Dorothea. But here the beggar-and-porter element might have come into play, for there was hardly a grain of sympathy between Ph\u0153be and frivolous, calculating Thorpie, who was at once fantastic and full of sordidness."], [55, "Trials on the Way. 45 Indeed Thorpie's mistress had more for bearance with her maid \u2014 whose foolish vanity, and metalic sharpness, her ladyship treated as she would have treated the ignorance and the selfishness of a child \u2014 than Ph\u0153be could muster. Thorpie, in her turn, was pert and slyly indifferent in her manner to Ph\u0153be, and could make her feel sore as no one else did at Brockcotes. \"It is very silly of me to care for a goose-and-fox of a young woman like Thor pie. I ought to look upon her as an in ferior specimen of the genus abigail,\" said Ph\u0153be to herself; but she did care after all for Thorpie's mingled stolidity and tri fling impertinence. When Ph\u0153be saw Lady Dorothea's maid sally from her point of vantage, and come mincing towards her, with hands carefully gloved from the sun, and a parasol above her head, she felt as if she was bidding adieu to heroics. She looked askance at her guide, made up her mind to have her temper tried before she reached the root house, and was very near grumbling at Lady"], [56, "Noblesse Oblige. 46 Dorothea's not coming herself to fetch her. To her surprise, she found, as they went along, that Thorpie was minded to be par ticularly gracious. \" Miss Paston, allow me to carry your waterproof,\" she said, officiously ; for Ph\u0153be had looked at a glorious mass of cumuli in the blue sky, and had come prepared for a thunder-shower. \" Yes, the rain do fall plump for these few weeks, and very worriting it is.

We could have gone to either of these places by one of the main walks through the proper grounds, and then we might have met Mr. Finlay, or Mr. Lawson, or some of the younger gardeners or foresters, in case of a thunder-clap, which, if it do come, will make me screech like a pea-hen, and scud like a lapwing.\" \" Surely your nerves are not quite so weak as that,\" urged Ph\u0153be. \" Oh ! yes, I know I shall ; for my"], [58, "Noblesse Oblige. 48 nerves ain't fit to stand a shock.

The hair was black and crisp, the skin sallow, the contour cat-shaped, and the eyes slightly glittering. The craft in the lineaments was oddly transparent. Ph\u0153be's own face flushed painfully at the first homage paid to the faint and remote prospect of her becoming a great lady.

Thorpie was by no means wise enough to comprehend the indignant scornful re volt of Ph\u0153be at the time-serving and the lip-loyalty which this change indicated. Was this to be an earnest of Ph\u0153be's harvest \u2014 that while, in the matter of friendship, she should be driven to cling to Mrs. Edgecumbe, she should, in the matter of service, be thankful to hire the duty of mercenaries like Thorpie ? It was certain that solemn, devoted Miss Thorpe, Mrs. Bald, Mr. Clarges, and Mr. Simmons would turn their righteous backs sternly on her, and, under the penalty of losing the places which they had filled for the better part of half a century, re fuse to acknowledge her as their sovereign.

As a rule Ph\u0153be was not nervous or tearful in the trials of her young life ; but she began to be plagued at this time with a lump in her throat, a quivering in her voice, and a dimness in her eyes, for which she could not account, and of which she was exceedingly ashamed."], [68, "58 Noblesse Oblige.

Whether or not a marriage with a Miss Palmer of Leicester (and it is known that such a person existed) really took place at the time the Marquis cooly declared it did, is not established ; but if a ceremony passed between the couple, it is thought a register of it may still be found in the vestry-book of some church in the county. The lawyers who have been consulted are hunting for the necesary evidence. Fairchester must wait their report, and so must we.

Yet if she did include herself in her sentence, however austere, had the ghost of \" Charming Nancy \" or Ph\u0153be room to complain ? And nobody could say that Lady Dorothea was not the truest, most magnanimous of women. \"No doubt there have been mesalliances in other families,\" Lady Dorothea proceeded, \" and they have not all been followed by signal judgments \u2014 oh dear no !

The artificial lake which could not be kept free from duck-weed, the elaborate bend of the slimy water, the wooded shore, the island with the diminutive ruin of what might have been a baby-house, and the connecting bridges, were all superannuated tricks of fashion.

Yet, if Lord Wriothesley had known it, Ph\u0153be was not thinking of him at all, as she sat there with flushed cheeks, lowered eyelids, and tremu lous mouth. She was thinking of Barty Wooler, and his blank career, compared with what it might have been, and how he had looked when she had spurned his last re monstrances. It did not matter that Ph\u0153be was angry with herself for thinking of Barty Wooler \u2014 his disadvantages and deprivations which he had brought upon himself. She had no great provocation; for if she had denied him a boon, and if that denial was shutting him out from the health and vigour of home, and a settled life, at least he was making it up to himself, and getting what costly distracting fire-works a not unright eous man could command, by resuming his old vagabond life with its old vagabond in demnifications. The Halls had mentioned Barty Wooler to Ph\u0153be, as having been an eye-witness of the short campaign between Prussia and Denmark, which decided the"], [103, "Folloios him like his Shadow. 93 fate of Holstein, and as very likely to be the first man to give Folksbridge a graphic de scription of the marriage of the Czarowich. Ph\u0153be had much better have thought of Lord Wriothesley, bending forward to look into her eyes, ready to risk the world for her love, prepared to crown her with a wo man's crown of renown.

If he was for bidden the light of his eyes, he would sub mit, but he would remember in absence, and be true to himself and her, who should be true to him till death.

Is there no remedy, and you Exmoors so flighty ?\" flashed up Ph\u0153be re proachfully. \" Is there no hope of his Lordship, Lord Fairchester that was, getting back his own ? or else, if it isn't his own, of the Queen's Majesty giving him another title and pro perty from her own purse, or from the purses of other people who have died with out children and their money fallen to her ?\" suggested Mrs. Paston. \" No more hope of the one than of the other.

But consider, Miss Paston, what suit he has to offer Dolly now, and whether he is the man to offer it, or she the woman to accept it ? It is a very sad calamity, I grant you ; but any farther proposal of union between the couple is impossible.\" It seemed that Lord Wriothesley could not advocate for his sister the views which he held for himself. He could judge dis creetly where she was concerned, while a higher virtue than prudence had seized upon him in his own affairs, and kept him fast. Ph\u0153be did not see Lady Dorothea again till Mr. Blount's short visit was past, and the two had taken farewell, or, as Lady Dorothea preferred to call it, had said good-bye. The establishment at Brockcotes was on the eve of being broken up for some time. Lord Exmoor was never so well and happy as"], [106, "Noblesse Oblige. 96 when reigning king, with liberty to be as odd and fidgetty as he liked in the capital of his territories. Both Lord and Lady Exmoor clave to their chief home, the pub lic show and spacious magnificence of which had its retirement and comfort to them. But there was something more than a noble Darby and Joan's inclinations to be looked to now. It could not be a judicious arrange ment to chain down Lady Dorothea in the scene of her early-planned marriage. She must be carried about, as Thorpie plainly phrased it, and put, at least, in the way of a new establishment. Again, it would be an outrage on paternal sense and devotion to say that while Lord Exmoor could not bring himself to attack the potent son and heir on his detrimental and distressing fancy for Miss Paston, this son was to have the excuse of living several months on end within a stone's throw of the painter's daughter, who should continue the bosom friend and favourite companion of his sister.

Ph\u0153be heard of Buxton and Brighton, and a succession of friendly country-houses and Highland shooting-lodges in the mean time, and of Rome, where the family had not stayed over a winter since Lady Doro thea was grown up. Possibly the spring would be spent in Paris, with the next season in town, and, if all were well, the autumn and winter after that at Swinley, because the Earl had not been resident there for a long while, and some improvements were pro jected at Swinley which would be the better for his personal superintendence. It was really like a breaking-up of the great Brock cotes establishment, such as had not been known in the present Earl's day ; and it was accordingly greatly lamented in Wellfield. The natives of the town felt that they were to be left behind and lost sight of. They had a shrewd, depressing suspicion that Lord Wriothesley's entanglement with Ph\u0153be Paston, of which nothing came at present, had something to do with the rout. So there VOL. III. H"], [108, "Noblesse Oblige. 98 was some grudge borne to the Pastons in consequence of the withdrawal of the Ex moor countenance, under which Mrs. Paston principally smarted. Ph\u0153be was suffering from a heavier blow. She felt as if she and Lady Dorothea were taking leave of all their youthful intimacy and attachment. Notwithstanding this im pression, her Ladyship distinguished Ph\u0153be particularly before the family went away, and came again to Wooers' Alley, as if to renew and intensify her assurance that no extrava gance or insanity of Lord Wriothesley's could make bad blood between her and Ph\u0153be. And this was after Lord Wriothesley had taken leave of Ph\u0153be. * \" We are going for the present,\" he had said, \" but we will come back possibly sooner than you think. For myself, I must be down, once and again, on the Earl's business and my own, between the general going and coming.

Should he live and she live, it would go hard, if, for all the disparities between the couple, the coronet of the Exmoors was not laid at her feet. She held up her head, and would not show her little world the pain she felt in the separation from Lady Dorothea, and what it might easily have mistaken for another feeling. Lady Dorothea, again, was calm, and even cheerful, in spite of the hollows in her cheeks which exaggerated the clear brightness of her eyes. She herself spoke of her thinness, half-laughingly advising Ph\u0153be to take care of her own shoulder-blades, and to watch in time for silver threads appearing in her brushed-back hair. In that case Ph\u0153be must have tonics, since she could not be conveyed about like a young leopard in a menagerie. She must throw herself into daily service and district visiting, or take up the cultivation of flowers \u2014 monster auricula and variegated ivy, or into the study of modern Chinese and ancient h2"], [110, "100 Noblesse Oblige. Anglo-Saxon, or into the practice of the stitches in the Countesses' hangings, or the loops in Mrs. Paston's knitting-bags \u2014 any thing whatever, to help her to do her duty. Lady Dorothea told Ph\u0153be that Mr. Blount was likely to go to one of the colo nies after his business with his cousin w7as wound up. There might have been terrible claims for past rents, with interest, left to hang like a millstone round the disinherited man's neck; but for very shame, Edmund Lord Fairchester would make a compromise. Lady Dorothea was to be allowed to cor respond with Mr. Blount. And why not? The two could be trusted, and they were dear friends, as she daresayed their children would be after them. \"You see, Ph\u0153be, everything is possible,\" insisted Lady Dorothea, \" where there is a will to keep one's feelings under control, to be temperate in all personal wishes, and to make the sacrifices which are required of us.\" When Lady Dorothea said this, Ph\u0153be was aware that her Ladyship strongly im plied that it was required of her to sacrifice"], [111, "Follows him like his Shadow. 101 Lord Wriothesley's generous regard and the grand promotion which, in its very dimness and distance, loomed so splendidly before her eyes.

It was not possible that she could be entirely fair to her friend, however fair her friend might be to her. And as she sat at home in Wooers' Alley, she reflected sadly that greatness might be its own bane, but that it was its own antidote too. Lady Dorothea was so accustomed to her superior advantages, that she hardly numbered amongst them the power of taking wings and fleeing away from the locality that was linked with her trouble. On the other hand, a middle-class girl like Ph\u0153be remained to brood and mope, grow self-centred, grasping, discon tented, and wretched, with her own mother wearing her flesh and blood out by useless questions, and dismal doubts and fears.

His course seemed that of a roll ing stone which would gather no moss. Mr. Blount and his expulsion and exile in Canada were in the way of being forgotten like other expulsions and exiles. There was no word of the marriages either of Lady Dorothea or of Lord Wrio thesley ; but Miss Dugdale had accomplished an excellent match with great settlements. Lord Wriothesley had advanced from his"], [114, "Noblesse Oblige. 104 clearing of the woods at Brockcotes and his bringing in of the water of Nannton, to the instituting of great dye-works on the estate of Swinley. He had discovered and demon strated the presence of chemical qualities in the water in the neighbourhood, which adapted it peculiarly for dyeing processes. The works had already made such progress, and this example was likely to be so largely followed in the district, that they had caused some talk, and had even won notice for the young nobleman from the public organs of the industries of England. Lord Wriothesley had also made his soli tary descents on Brockcotes and Wellfield as his father's envoy, and he had constantly, although not ostentatiously, repaired to the Pastons. The Earl at last thought it high time to broach the proscribed topic, and to utter a stringent remonstrance. But he was even yet loth to do his office, and did it with as much reserve as haughtiness.

Lord Exmoor hesitated as he addressed his son in the smoking-room, which the fam ily happened to occupy when the gentlemen were alone together at a confidential hour. He prefaced his lecture with an expres sion of regret that he could no longer mis take his son's motive for avoiding every over ture towards making an establishment for himself, and marrying. \" I can only say, that it is neither for your credit, nor for the happiness of the young lad}7 whom it seems you have the misfortune to admire, that there should be an idle un meaning yielding to her attractions, and a perpetual return within the sphere of her influence.\" Lord Wriothesley bent his brows, and smoothed them again, stood firm, and looked his father in the face, when he said in dis tinct tones \u2014 \" You need not fear for my credit ; but I"], [116, "106 Noblesse Oblige. have to thank you for the store you set on her happiness, although I cannot flatter my self that it is deeply imperilled by my inti macy with her father's family.\" \" But why put her happiness in peril at all ?

Ph\u0153be might have altogether forgotten Barty Wooler, and his spice of English reck lessness and desperation ; she might have been won to much more than half-bashful affection for Lord Wriothesley, and pride in him, but that for the last six months her mind was otherwise occupied. She could not give all her attention to the visitor who came running across from Lombardy, the Black Forest, or the Polish plain, and who, within twenty-four hours of his arrival at Brockcotes, was sunning himself in her glances, and dropping words of devotion and fidelity too significant to be mistaken, and yet too slight for the hearer to take them up and answer them. She bestowed only partial notice on the gleanings which he brought for her inspection, gleanings of"], [122, "112 Noblesse Oblige. pictures, wood carving, antiquarian relics, and a gem or two not unmeet for the jewel cases and old sumpter chests of Brockcotes. But neither did he take upon him to offer for her acceptance another gift, unless it were the small tributes of a collar, a drink ing cup and a whistle for Bess, which always knew him, and was less tardy in responding to his advances than Bess's mistress. But she had another cause for real trou ble on account of her father's failing health. It was manifestly failing now, and that ra pidly, though he fought a hard fight to work as well as ever. For a long time Mrs. Paston would not see the creeping ghastliness of what had al ways been Caleb Paston's delicate habit of body, and put down Ph\u0153be's apprehension as a girl's moping. For a still longer time Mr. Paston was indignant at all interference with him, or entreaties that he should stop painting, and try a change of life.

Mr. Paston smiled faintly at the advice. \" It would be a case of spontaneous com bustion with me, if I went out of harness,\" he maintained, \" but I shall certainly try the diet and the medicine, and if I do not get better in a short time, I shall think of such arrangements as are left me to make in order that my mind may be easy.\" VOL.

He said to her shortly: \"Ph\u0153be, child, I should like you to take an oppor tunity of looking in on Mrs. Wooler; you call for the old woman sometimes, don't you?\" \" Yes, papa, I have called on Mrs. Wool er,\" answered Ph\u0153be, as cheerfully as she could. \"That's right.

You must ascertain whether he is in a quarter from which he could be here in a reason able time. I don't doubt he would come, for he was always a kindly, confiding fellow.

Ph\u0153be understood, of course, that she was implicitly ranked among the new acquaintances. But all that was no matter.

But when she fulfilled her part of the mission, she found that much of its disa greeableness and difficulty vanished on the spot. Her heart was too full of her father to leave her any room for the purely pain ful consciousness that she was sitting in the drab-coloured parlour, regarded curiously by Mrs. Wooler, as the girl who had first bewitched and then refused Barty, and who was so foolishly uplifted and arrogant as to be philandering with Lord Wriothesley."], [128, "Noblesse Oblige. 118 On the other hand, the old woman had ceased to fear Ph\u0153be in the field of her own life, and she was not dead to the softening effect of the circumstances under which Ph\u0153be came. The old woman might not put much weight on mental trouble, unless it were that of her son Barty, but she had great respect for bodily affliction in others. One could see on a glance at Ph\u0153be's quiver ing mouth and straining eyes, that the daugh ter was struck by the suspicion that the father's illness was mortal, though she strove to strangle the suspicion. Mrs. Wooler might think that Caleb Paston's illness was retribution ; but that did not hinder him from being a man whom God was smiting. Mrs. Wooler, who had borne him a heavy grudge all these years, and prophesied many a time that calamity would overtake him, was far too much of a stout old Christian not to be guilty of the signal inconsistency of shrinking from the reward of her vigil when its fulfilment came. \" Oh ! indeed !\" she said ; \" and is your father so poorly, Miss Paston? I am sorry;"], [129, "A Friend in Need. 119 yes, I am sorry to hear it, and I wish him well again, I do.\" Mrs. Wooler spoke ear nestly, and not unsympathetically. \"We are poor frail creatures, and when it comes to the end it lays our pride low, and stills our wrath.

They are always a settling of their affairs, these rich old men. Barty will do the bidding of the sick man who asks for his presence, so far as I can speak for my son ; and I know of no reason that should keep him away.

Barty travelled straight to Wellfield on the first notice that he was wanted. But although he was there within a few days, Mr. Paston's old complaint had taken a start in a down ward direction, and he was very much worse \u2014 suffering paroxysms of violent illness, and so shaken and feeble between them, that when he had attempted to lift a brush that morning, his hand had fallen powerless by his side, and a mist had come between him and the canvas. It was evident that now he must relinquish his work since his work re linquished him. If he had been a woman, he"], [131, "A Friend in Need. 121 wouldhave succumbed altogether, havetaken to bed and turned his face to the wall. But he was up and dressed as usual, tottering about the old familiar ground, or lying back in his sitters' chair, looking thoughtfully at his work, mostly at the first and the last of it,\u2014 the \"Theft by the Bellini,\" and the \" Reconciliation of Jacob and Esau.\" Ph\u0153be was hovering about her father, pre pared to nurse him. She was the more set on it, because of her mother being more and more overcome, by the evidences of the pro gress of her husband's illness. Mrs. Paston was shocked and terrified on every fresh token. These tokens were as strange, ap palling, and heart-breaking to Ph\u0153be ; but she could feel in her distress an unspeakable thankfulness for undreamt of reserves of strength on her own part. She could keep her anguish mute. Mrs. Paston was not only more unready than ever, she could not help showing her feelings, and becoming positive ly injurious and vexatious to her husband.

Think of the weakness or the generosity of humanity ! Why, the old men are as proud of the small concession as if I had brought a fresh fifty thousand into the concern.

Rubens did it, along with Sneyders and with Teniers, too, on occasion. But all I can say is, that if the disparity between them was as great, then Rubens was an ass.

If I am laid aside for a length of time,\" he said, with an emphasis on the words, \" I should not like these pictures to lie so much dead stock, or care to lose the heaviest price I was ever promised, supposing that I could have the half of it. I have done reasonably well. Paint ing is not so bad a profession as it is called.

But I should not like to lose the money-value of these pictures, with the rest that may be disposed of, when the occasion offers, in order to make a better provision for my wife and daughter.\" \" Well, I'll see about it, Paston,\" accorded Barty, slowly. \"Which means that you agree.

Barty might have done anything, every thing, for his old friend and enemy ; but he could not, without the utmost force put upon himself, look on at suffering where there was little to be done except to look. Ph\u0153be, so much younger and weaker than he was, could do this in which he failed, not only at that moment, but in many attacks during the following weeks. The spasms, increased in number, became more prolonged in duration, and more intolerable in the agony with which they were attended. Ph\u0153be, as well as the doctor, could always meet and master them, so far as supporting her father by her presence and sympathy could go. And she had her father very much to herself at last. She feared she was selfish, but her poor wounded heart found some balm in the fact, and in her father's continual love of her pre sence, and dependence on such solace as she could give."], [141, "Passing Away. 131 \" I am here, papa,\" she would say, as if there was something of a talisman in her company, and as if she could fight Death single-handed. The girl was lifted above herself. She would stand for hours by her father's side, running up and down stairs, comforting her mother, and beginning at last to comfort Barty Wooler. Mrs. Paston's well-meaning weakness grew pathetic. She ceased to wonder at Ph\u0153be's stillness and strength, while she sobbed out her gratitude for her daughter's duty and devotion, and pled with her as if Ph\u0153be had been the parent and she the child. \"Let me see your father, Ph\u0153be ; I'll be good, I'll not rouse or worry him. If you will only tell him not to make a joke to me, like he tried to do this morning, and then looked wistfully in my face with his great eyes, and said, ' My dear, I think you and I have been happy together, after all ;' as if I had ever minded the poor thing's sharp speeches.

After the last, during the night, he ral lied so quickly, and talked for half an hour. (Do you think I should not have let him talk ? But he had something he wished to tell me.\") Barty Wooler could have taken the shoes from his feet, because it was holy ground. The only evidence Ph\u0153be gave of being tried to the utmost, was in saying to Barty one day, in accents waxing shrill in their in tensity \u2014 \"I have often shuddered to hear old peo ple say it ; but do you know, if his pain lasts, I think I shall yet come to be glad to see papa lying at his rest.\" Barty Wooler was sensible of the strain on Ph\u0153be's powers, and deplored it as if he"], [143, "Passbig Away. 133 had been her father. \" Death in the house in Wooers' Alley,\" he told himself, \" death sore in its untimeliness, and with a girl to bear the brunt of it, and to have her nerves shattered and her imagination haunted all her life afterwards. Is it not unheard of, or at least what should not be ? The Halls might be sent for, but it happens unfortu nately that all of them, save the old man, have gone abroad with Frank for his holi day. Even though they were here, I don't suppose Paston would tolerate them about him. He was always horribly sensitive, poor fellow ! The Exmoor family, if they were at home, would be still less available, not withstanding that lady nurses are the high fashion in hospitals and barracks. What a great lubberly middle-aged cub I must be to go into a fever over so ordinary a calamity as this.\" So Barty Wooler scourged himself on Ph\u0153be's account, and then he looked wist fully at his mother, yet he neither spoke nor looked as if anything more than com mon humanity moved him."], [144, "134 Noblesse Oblige. Mrs. Wooler had more than a respect for death ; it had a positive fascination for her. She would not only lend her aid in his last weakness to the man at whose gate she had sat in righteous indignation for a quar ter of a century, but she would even have a pitiful inclination to look on him in his death. \" If they would admit me, son Barty, I might be of some service,\" she proposed, with not more than a little flutter. \" I don't think he and I would choke on the bone in our throats at this time of day,\" she pro ceeded, in a kind of shamefaced way. \" It is not that I don't think he snatched what was not his own, mind you ; but what of that when he is called on to give up the whole world ?\" \" You could be of the greatest use, mo ther; I am sure you could,\" Barty gave eager confirmation. \" There is not another such active, clear-headed old woman in the kingdom. Is it not heinous to leave a girl as good as alone in such trouble ? Do try what you can do, mother. I think he would"], [145, "Passing Away. 135 not dislike to see you,\" said Barty, catching at the suggestion. If any one had told Ph\u0153be three months before who would watch with her by her father's death-bed, she would not have be lieved it ; but if any one had farther at tempted to persuade her that Mrs. Wooler would be welcomed to her father's sick room, the speaker would have aroused the girl's saddest scorn. When the event came, Ph\u0153be was more pliable and more amenable to her neighbours. Her father's situation had swallowed up so much, that she had actually ceased for the moment to recall anything connected with Barty, save that he was her father's oldest and \u2014 since their re conciliation \u2014 his dearest friend. She could go to Barty in this light without difficulty or scruple. It seemed to her that there would have been light-mindedness in making any scruple. Barty brought his mother, an old experienced woman at the bedsides of the sick and the dying, to advise and instruct her, who had but a momentary shrinking at the voice of a stranger. And she was fain"], [146, "136 Noblesse Oblige. to be advised and instructed. She had a keen comprehension of her need of this good service. There is so much humility in true greatness, that it rendered Ph\u0153be meeker ; and the \" bands of a man \" are al ways drawn closer by what threatens a breach in humanity. It was all simple to Ph\u0153be, though it was a great puzzle to the public of Wellfield. Ph\u0153be's father had only smiled faintly when she had answered his startled inquiry as to the once familiar voice, which he had distinguished, and the head in the old fashioned cap, of which he had caught a glimpse hovering behind his curtain. So there was no reason why she should not yield to the strong spirit and the sagacity which came within her reach. In yielding, she unconsciously propitiated and flattered Mrs. Wooler, and experienced the gentleness that belongs to real strength of mind and will, even when they lurk under the rough est mask. She never sailed to declare after wards that Mrs. Wooler was a friend to her then, and that she saw nothing of the old-"], [147, "Passing Away. 137 woman's sternness in those days of mourn- ing. Towards the close of Mr. Paston's illness he received the visits of his clergyman, and the last consolations of religion.

I am to join with papa, and so is mamma, if she can stand it. Don't you think she will like to look back on it ? And papa is asking for you as if he wanted you to be one of us. Would it be wrong to wake up your mother after her sleepless night ? You and she were such old friends of his, and you have been so much with him at the last ! And, oh ! dear, this is about the last thing !\" Ph\u0153be broke down a little as she said the words, but she recovered herself in a mo ment, and as with a flash of consciousness that her work was not yet done."], [148, "Noblesse Oblige. 138 Barty said it was a privilege of which he was not worthy, and so said his mother to herself, in very low accents, when he roused her \u2014 \" Lord !

As in the case of many dying men, Mr. Paston's mind turned back and dwelt on the past with its key to his character and his destiny. \" I have never ceased to be sorry, Barty,\" he muttered. \" I thought once to atone ; I see now there is no atonement in that sense.\" \" Don't speak of it,\" entreated Barty, by far the more cut up and abashed of the two. \" What was it in the beginning and at the utmost ? A trifle between a couple of boys. How you have thought of it and magnified it, Caleb ! It was I who was by far the most to blame for not forgetting it an age ago.\" \" It was not a trifle to you and me, Barty,\" said Mr. Paston ; and he called to the friend of his youth, \"Kiss me, Barty.\" To Ph\u0153be the whole scene was removed from what she had known, and was utter ly dream-like. But among the visions of her father's death-bed, which Barty Wooler had spoken of as likely to haunt her to her dying day, the foremost was the strong man's face, bent down and laid beside the grey"], [150, "140 Noblesse Oblige. shadow of a face on the pillow in a caress which they might not have exchanged when they were boys, although they had lived to gether like brothers. \" Where are you, Ph\u0153be, and your mo ther?\" And to these two was devoted the small remaining portion of the sick man's time, broken by loving, disjointed epithets, and interjections and references to a better home, and to an undying Father and Brother \u2014 the whole family in heaven and in earth. These are the common utterances when good men come to die, mixed with what is com moner still, that plaintive, ever-recurring re quest to know the hour and the minute of time, when time itself is about to be no more. In a wandering word or two dropped by lips growing cold, Caleb Paston betrayed the strength of the friendship against which he had sinned, and his clinging to Barty Wooler both in rupture and in reunion. So far as the listeners could follow him, Caleb spoke of the prodigal Lord Thomas of Brock cotes, whose picture he had painted in the beginning of his career, gaining by it the old"], [151, "Passing Away. 141 Earl's favour, and the means of the pilgrim age to Rome \u2014 the Jerusalem of painters.

Otherwise the sinner would have borne it willingly, heartily, and brought himself to cover it over, or lay it bare, as the vindication and the salvation of a brother man might demand.

She recalled all that was great in him \u2014 his fervour and zeal in his art, with the temptation which his very greatness might in this respect have been to him, and his fatherly, unselfish regard for her.

But Ph\u0153be and Mrs. Paston were well aware that they were by no means the first persons with Uncle Hall and Cousin Frank. The two bereaved women in Wooers' Alley occupied a very different relation to the Folksbridge merchant and the London jour nalist \u2014 the only men on whom they had a kindred claim, to what they had done to their own great artist, lying stiff and stark, of whom they said, with swelling hearts, that now he was dead, the heedless world would wake up a little, and recognise how"], [154, "Noblesse Oblige. 144 great he had been.

Mrs. Paston was beginning to recover from her prostration, and to cry out querul ously as to what she and Ph\u0153be were to do without poor Paston. Her brother Hall might have been with her if he had chosen to exert himself, though she could not have endured the sight of him, with his loud step, and rustling newspapers. But his mind was set on markets and money bags. As for a grand admirer of a nobleman, there was lit tle comfort to be had from him at such a pinch.

Where as he was a mere fine gentleman dangler, whom it was a shame to speak of at such a season. See how Ph\u0153be and she were forced to have recourse to those whose claims had been as good as despised, and to depend upon them. But Mrs. Paston did not mean to bear hard on her darling fatherless daugh ter. Only, after Ph\u0153be was left an orphan entirely, she would know what it was to live. She could not even have Barty Wooler then to come and see her, and take on his shoulders all the dismal load of notifica tions, funeral letters, burial fees, under takers' accounts, and registrations. Far less could Ph\u0153be, without her mother, propose to receive Lord Wriothesley the next time he was down at Brockcotes : the proceeding would not be within the bounds of common discretion, but would provoke the loudest challenge and condemnation.

The man's frailties had died with the man. Mrs. Pas ton's imagination was a dull and dense me dium ; but it began thenceforth to cast an after-glow on the warp and woof of tangled matrimonial threads. From the day she was a widow, she referred all her evils and trials without reservation to the great mis fortune of Paston's having been taken from her. Had he been spared, she would have been saved from bad servants, tic in the temples, and Henrietta cloth that would not dip a renewed black. The contrary experience of all her previous life failed to shake her conviction that, without that chief cross, no other cross would have come near her. With soft forbearance Ph\u0153be came to be glad over her mother's delusion. She even began to think that no veil was so like a shroud of freshly-fallen snow, dropped from the heavens themselves, as the veil which"], [157, "The Chief Mourner. 147 often descends between the living and the dead. Even then she was vaguely satisfied that it should muffle jarring echoes, warm a chilled heart, soothe her mother. But Ph\u0153be was hardly able for a time to recog nise and respond much to that or any other influence. She had been strong when her struggle was needed, but she was weak now, crushed by the blow which had struck her, only sensible that her father had died, and was about to be buried, at a season and in weather clearing into one of those rare English St. Martin's summers, on which, in their peculiar combination of the depth of a borrowed October and the brightness of a transferred June, the artist had set full store. Barty Wooler had relieved Ph\u0153be and acted for her in her duties. He was care ful of intruding upon her, or of making even his work for her a burden ; but the day before the funeral he was forced to seek an interview. \" I am so sorry to bring you down,\" he said, in quick commiseration, as Ph\u0153be en- l2"], [158, "Noblesse Oblige. 148 tered the drawing-room, walking wearily in her heavy black gown. \" I thought you had better know Lord Wriothesley is come.\" \" It is very kind of him,\" Ph\u0153be professed, still too spent with feeling to realize the situation. \" Must I see him?\" she inquired, in her low, depressed tones. \"That is for you to say.\" Ph\u0153be looked up. He was not detaining her by making her sit down or by sitting down himself. He stood grasping the back of a chair and staring at her fixedly. Then it all came back upon her with painful dis tinctness \u2014 the claims of the Exmoor family, and the footing on which she had stood with Lord Wriothesley. It had never grated on her with so unreal, so fanciful, and forced a character as it did at this moment, as she witnessed Barty Wooler's unconcealed sur prise at her hesitation. \" I suppose I ought to see Lord Wrio thesley, since he has come down, I imagine, on purpose,\" she said, hurriedly. \" Will you let him know that mamma and I will see him when he chooses to call ?\""], [159, "The Chief Mourner. 149 She had the notion as Barty observed that he was to see Lord Wriothesley on her account, and she made an involuntary dis tinction between her reception of him and of Lord Wriothesley, whether he was to take it in the light of a compliment or not. And where was the use of undeceiving her, or indeed of keeping her longer there with him since Lord Wriothesley was come? He was vindicating his right ; and the rest that remained of what was strictly the last ser vice to be done for Caleb Paston, as well as the settlement of the affairs of the family, had better be left to Lord Wriothesley, at least to Lord Wriothesley in conjunction with Mr. Hall, who was so up to his ears in business, that he made his appearance at his brother-in-law's funeral with an engrossed, distracted air.

If Caleb Paston could have spoken from his coffin and appointed his chief mourner, it would have gone hard with his individual inclinations if the man he had loved and wronged had not been named to walk next his bier. Ph\u0153be listened with downcast eyes to Lord Wriothesley's soft words. \" I am so sorry ; Dora is so concerned for you. We have all met with a heavy loss. I wish I could have come in time to see him. I am afraid he suffered much, but there is one comfort \u2014 his suffering is over.\" Ph\u0153be was powerless to interpose and prevent Barty Wooler's withdrawal.

It seemed hard for her to be disturbed by these considerations at such a time ; yet she was persuaded it should be Barty Wooler, who, having begun, should end the role.

For it proved to be a pro vision of Mr. Paston's Will that Ph\u0153be and her mother should settle in Folksbridge, with the sufficient competence which was secur ed to them. Mrs. Paston did not merely consent to the removal. Impatient of the oppressive sense of their loss, and restless in the anticipation of a change, she listened readily to her brother's suggestion. Mr. Hall, falling in with this, represented that he could not be continually going and com ing between Folksbridge and Wellfield to manage their affairs, and that the easiest and most comfortable plan, subject, of course, to"], [166, "Noblesse Oblige. 156 the approval of their noble patron, would be to repair within a few weeks to Folksbridge. It would be the very sort of change they needed. The furniture in the house in Wooers' Alley could be packed up and stored in a wareroom, and the mother and daughter could go into lodgings, and at their leisure look out for a house, and settle themselves thoroughly to their minds. Ph\u0153be, on the other hand, did not care for a speedy change ; she did not want to quit Wellfield at all. To give up Wooers' Alley, and the house where she had been born and bred, and where she had dreamt her grand youthful dreams, was like another sentence of death to her, and she writhed and turned faint under it. She almost won dered her father could have thought of it. But as he had thought of it, and as her mo ther seemed to have set her heart upon it, she was too broken and shaken for resist ance. It was rather a hard case that Mrs. Paston, who must needs be always under somebody's guidance, should not uniformly own allegiance to her own daughter. The"], [167, "A Change of Scene. 157 truth was, Ph\u0153be's influence with her mo ther, which was paramount in its season, had no better chance than that of another when that other chose to exert it. Now it was Barty Wooler whose power was in the as cendant, now Lord Wriothesley, and again Mr. Hall. Mrs. Paston was apt to pass from the sphere of the one to that of the other with the most dizzying inconstancy. It signified nothing that Mr. Hall was the member of her circle who most commonly aggrieved her, and against whose practices she took the greatest liberty of complaint \u2014 a liberty unexercised since Mr. Paston's death. Ph\u0153be crept about in her first essays at fresh exertion, and tried to take a prolonged farewell of all the familiar places and ob jects around her, which she had held in such loving estimation, and to which she had come back and clung so kindly after her little flights. She tried to realise that she was breaking with them and resigning them for ever. In these last weeks she saw* very httle of Barty Wooler, less even than of"], [168, "158 Noblesse Oblige. Lord Wriothesley, though he too was mind ful of her weariness and the exaction of her sorrow. But Barty had not sought to at tend in Wooers' Alley more than was abso lutely necessary from the moment that Lord Wriothesley had appeared upon the scene ; and in retiring, he had taken his mother with him. After recording his acceptance of Mr. Paston's trust of his pictures, he had made what sounded the perfectly reasonable announcement, that nothing could be done without time and deliberation. Indeed the subject had better not be thought of in the meanwhile. The collection could be con signed to him when the Pastons left Well field, and he would have it conveyed either to Folksbridge or to London. There might be no difficulty in the matter, but Ph\u0153be thought it was less than kind of Barty to desert them as he had done. It might be because she was stricken in spirit that she felt so sorely that he was throwing them up on Lord Wriothesley's connexion, and that he was affording his Lordship a pretext to continue to make himself prominent, as he"], [169, "A Change of Scene. 159 had done when he came down on the oc casion of Ph\u0153be's father's death. Ph\u0153be knew that Barty had a defiant temper, together with something of a radical spirit ; but after all that had passed between him and her father, and the solemn pledges which had been given and taken, she did think that considerations for them might have had more weight with him. Not that she arrogated any title to the man's care. He had been forbearing, forgiving, and oh! so generous already, that this could not but make one sigh for his imperfections. Ph\u0153be did more than sigh, she submitted with an ache and a smart indeed ; but she secretly resent ed his allowing himself to be put aside by Lord Wriothesley, thus getting the whole three of them clamoured over, until even Miss Rowe became hoarse. It was Ph\u0153be's lot to depart from Well field under a full blare of trumpets. The old story of Barty Wooler's enslavement, by which Miss Rowe had always stood, not withstan ding Milly Medlar's insinuated doubts, had been revived in full force by Barty"], [170, "160 Noblesse Oblige. turning up and waiting on his former friend's death-bed. Now Lord Wriothesley eclipsed Barty ; and in place of the rivals fighting it out over Ph\u0153be's hand, Barty simply stood aloof, leaving the field free to his enemy. \" Was there ever such a girl, Mrs. Med lar ?\" exclaimed Miss Rowe, in exasperation ; \" she will be the death of me. I never heard of such another. I believe she has both of the men \u2014 the ci-devant artist and millionaire-mercer Barty Wooler, and our young peer \u2014 as the two strings to her bow.\" \" But,\" good-natured Mrs. Medlar hinted darkly, in panting desperation, \" do you call it a respectable act for a whipper-snapper of a girl like that to take all the great catches in England to her own share, and play fast and loose with them ? She ought to be ashamed of herself, the jilty, flirting thing, and the turf on her father's grave not green yet, when older, more solid girls, for want of a decent offer, are sit-fasts by the score.\" \" By the forty, Mrs. Medlar,\" answered Miss Rowe, with a smile of acquiescence that"], [171, "A Change of Scene. 161 skilfully hid the real tartness of the intent ; \" but there is that old farmer's daughter, Judith Clay, has taken to countenancing the young lady, who, if our good Earl would but consent to die in time, is prepared to throw the stuck-artist over her shoulder by a coup-detat worthy of Louis Napoleon.

She said to herself that it was their persistence that had provoked the gossip, doubly painful at this time. She would not see that this w7as but an instal ment of the price of the exquisite setting she had coveted for her life. She allowed herself to be offended by what she called Lord Wriothesley's complacence and self-con fidence, when all the time he was as scrupul ous as Barty Wooler of trespassing upon her retirement. Lord Wriothesley's great aim in remaining at Brockcotes was to be near VOL. III.

He was even cautious of in terfering in the slightest degree with her change of residence, and her going to dwell among her Folksbridge relations. He must have felt that if he interposed, or entered the smallest reason against the Pastons' re moval, it would be scrupulously prevented by Mr. Hall and Mrs. Paston. But so long as he could not offer Ph\u0153be a house, and declare his desire that she should accept the establishment with which, as with a seat in Parliament, his father had proposed to supply him, how could he dictate anything relating to the Pastons' movements? While the years dragged on during which he would be out of the world, occupied in the perform ance of his appointed task, was he to deprive her of the solace of her kindred ? If he was anything more than a gentleman in name, Lord Wriothesley did not see how he could cross poor Paston's natural and sensible pro posal for his wife's sojourn in her widow hood. Very likely it was a precaution"], [173, "A Change of Scene. 163 against the world's saying that Ph\u0153be lived on at the Brockcotes gates as a patient pe titioner for Brockcotes' grace. Ph\u0153be made no appeal to Lord Wriothesley that could tempt him to interpose with opposite advice. She knew as well as he did that the lifting of his finger could have kept her from going away, yet she did not say a word to him, any more than to Barty Wooler, of the com pulsion under which she went. ii 2"], [174, "164 Noblesse Oblige. CHAPTER XI. U7ider her Cross. IT. MARTIN'S summer of good eight weeks was not over, although these weeks had rounded one of those crises in life which makes a woman feel as much older as if her hair had grown gray in the interval. Wellfield still lay under those wonderful sunsets \u2014 glorious in amber, crimson, purple, sea-green, and royal blue \u2014 and those twi lights never seen save over leafless woods, and bare corn-fields, when it is as if all the rich hues had fled to the sky, and been de tained there a little while to throw a reflec tion of heavenly glory over a stripped ashen gray and brown-tinted earth. Ph\u0153be had not to cross the threshold ex cept to go to church, and to make one call"], [175, "Under her Cross. 165 \u2014 yes, one call ; for she must repeat her thanks, and bid good-bye to Mrs. Wooler. In church, while she had a haunting con sciousness of whose dust lay in the grave yard outside, and while she was seeking to support her mother's faltering steps, and to receive comfort from the service, she could not escape seeing Lord Wriothesley in the great Exmoor pew, sitting solitary in his mourning, nor refrain from stealing a look to ascertain whether Barty Wooler also wore mourning for his friend, as he sat by his mo ther in their old corner. Ph\u0153be found Mrs. Wooler at home, and during the few moments that she sat beside her with a full heart, she met with charit able, nay, even friendly treatment. Mrs. Wooler gave her an almost hasty good-bye. \" Miss Paston, God bless you, small and great.\" It looked as if it were a proclamation of peace between them, to the extent of a per mission from Mrs. Wooler to go and become the great lady she aspired to be, since she had shown herself a good daughter, and a"], [176, "166 Noblesse Oblige. capable young woman in a house of sick ness and death ; and Ph\u0153be went with a choking heart. The Pastons' immediate departure had one advantage. There could be no general leave-taking. Ph\u0153be would come back and pay off her arrears of good-will and civility. As for Lady Dorothea, she had received a letter from her, as full of warm-hearted, wo manly sympathy and interest as if her lady ship had never known a trial, and did not have a brother in the way of whose prefer ment Ph\u0153be stood an innocent but immov able obstacle. That seemed a sufficient test of friendship. Without going out of the house, soon to be her home no longer, Ph\u0153be could take her last lingering looks at the scenes that would most dwell in her memory \u2014 at the tower of St. Basil's ; her withered winter-garden, now so much in keeping with her feelings ; the ladder-like ascent of Wooers' Alley ; the pile of Brockcotes on the height, all crested by the rainbow horizons of those solemnly magnificent St. Martin's sunsets. She had a"], [177, "Under her Cross. 167 joy amidst her sorrow at leaving these scenes. She would carry their memories with this peculiar, utmost beauty shed upon them. Again, she would sometimes stoop down and stroke the readily-proffered, sorely puzzled head of little Bess, as she said, \" You are only a silly little dog, Bess. You do not know \" Then she would break off piteous! y, as she looked at the merrv wagging of the jaunty feather of a tail, and the glancing of the brown eyes. It was as if Bess's mistress had grown too wise and sad in her wisdom, since the light-hearted, fearless days when she had been proud and happy to accept Lord Wriothesley's gift without heeding the consequences. Yet now, when the days were all melancholy, and Ph\u0153be quailed at the thought of what lay behind and before her, even a dumb animal was some comfort in its tender affection and perfect unconsci ousness. But if Ph\u0153be was weak here, she was not always and altogether weak. She could"], [178, "168 Noblesse Oblige. sometimes look up under her cross of sorrow and perplexity. It was at this time that she began to pray, in her simplicity and extrem ity, the prayer of faith and longing, which she prayed often afterwards : \" Lord Jesus, wilt Thou not come to set the wrong right, and bring back the lost, as Thou wert wont ? Forgive our un worthi ness and unwillingness, and make us worthier and more willing.\" Every day she went and came several times to and from the painting-room, in face of her mother's prohibitions and remons trances, although she could do nothing but stand and look around her and recall the days which were no more. The last day and the last visit to the old painting-room in Wooers' Alley arrived too soon for her. She could scarcely believe that she was not to enter the precincts again, unless as a stranger in a strange house. The rest of the building was more or less dismantled, but this room remained the same. There were all the objects wdiich she knew so well, the places where her father had been accus-"], [179, "Under her Cross. 169 tomed to stand and to sit, and the places which had been set apart for her since she played as a child, messed herself rubbing down colours or clearing them away, or served as a model, and later, was suffered to bring her work or her book, and be at hand with the mother- wit of her criticism on her father's painting. There were the casts of deathless groups, with the deathlessness of their majesty and pathos shining like a token of immortality out of the common crumbling clay : the Del Sarto, with the last longing of despair in the evil eyes of its Virgin ; the pleasant rustic Bassani; Mr. Paston's own Bellini, Jacob and Esau, and Kilmarnock and Bal merino, in which Ph\u0153be was to have sat for Balmerino's wife, Peggy. But it was none of these, dearly as Ph\u0153be prized them, which it broke her heart to part from. The stamp of genius on them would win care and regard for them wherever they went. It was the humble and ordinary things \u2014 the worn brushes, the cracked palette, the rick etty Saul, which the child Ph\u0153be had dressed"], [180, "170 Noblesse Oblige. up as a giant doll, and which now stood presiding over the scene like a gaunt and grisly skeleton. These cast-aside tools of his trade had been part of her dead father's life, which nobody would mind now but her; and she was going away and leaving them to be tossed aside as worthless wrecks. Ph\u0153be broke into violent weeping, and it was thus that Barty Wooler, opening the door and entering to see after his trust, found her. He would have retreated if he could ; for how did he know that Lord Wriothes ley, whom he had seen in the town that day, would not follow her to give her his sup port, in turning her back on her father's sanctuary. But he could not leave a woman, and, above all, Ph\u0153be Paston, in such dis tress \u2014 besides, she was calling to him. \" Do not go, Mr. Wooler, please, I want to ask you will you have these poor things and keep them for his sake ?\" Here was something which she could ask from him, and which he could do for her, something which was not within Lord Wrio thesley's province."], [181, "Under her Cross. 171 \"Yes, I will, for him and from you, Ph\u0153be.

In Folksbridge. IHE murky atmosphhere, the ugly buildings, the pushing crowds of Folksbridge, were a new scene to Ph\u0153be, though she had known Folksbridge very well in the girlish days when she was finishing her education there, and had come out in such society as it afforded. But she was sensible that she was coming to a new Folksbridge, when she put her foot in the dull, half-garish, half-faded lodgings of which the Halls approved highly, because they were in the genteel reserve of a by-street in the suburb of a thoroughfare, and were kept by a decayed gentlewoman, who had no other lodgers, and followed no other trade. When she revisited Garnet Lodge, she had the same impression of it as before,"], [183, "In Folksbridge. 173 though she thought that the outside looked more than ever all croquet-ground, newest nurseryman's shrubs, and fresh stucco, and the inside latest upholstery and modish curi osities. In the faint stirrings of life, just recover ing from what partakes of the nature of a trance, Ph\u0153be could have wished that she had left behind her some of the belongings of her old life, Avhich she had carried hither. She could have wished to live over again and alter entirely some of the most signifi cant passages in her past history. Like a disguised princess on the stage, distracted from the development of her coming dig nity and triumph by the gnawing at her heart of a real personal pain, she began to regard the prestige of Lord Wriothesley's homage as more vexatious than agreeable, and to desire to escape from it into privacy and obscurity. She had allowed to slip from her the right of choice without having made a deliberate, decided choice. She was as much committed to receiving Lord Wrio thesley's ultimate addresses as he was to pay-"], [184, "Noblesse Oblige. 174 ing them, if they were ever in his option. She had often heard that the woman who hesitates is lost. She had hesitated and was lost, so far as free will was concerned. Whether she lived to marry Lord Wriothes ley or not, she might live to have it proved that she had done both herself and him grievous injury. Tidings of the prestige which was thus crushing Ph\u0153be were in Folksbridge before her. Stunned and rendered supercilious as the Halls had been by the first faint report of Ph\u0153be's conquest of Lord Exmoor's son, they had not failed to spread the report widely, both in Ph\u0153be's interest and their own. Already, in its most distant ramifica tions, the Halls' set was looking out for Ph\u0153be, with the intention of being pro foundly struck by one who could flesh her maiden sword by the arrest of a confirmed rover like Barty Wooler, and not content with this, could achieve the enslavement of the son and heir of one of the greatest peers in the country. Accordingly there was a lively curiosity to"], [185, "In Folksbridge. 175 see Ph\u0153be now, and eager solicitations for introductions to her from the luxurious daughters and foppish sons of the rich Folks bridge merchants. She was even called \" the beautiful Miss Paston, who had caught the fancy of Lord Wriothesley.\" But of course her title was rather to that of loveli ness, in its French sense of loveableness, than to beauty. The traits which were merging into those of pure sweet womanli ness, ennobled by being troubled and tried, might have claimed this for her. But a dis tinction at which she might only have pouted, as being, after all, snobbish, although it amused her thoughtlessness, hurt her anew, and even brought the tears to her eyes. The big folks of Folksbridge, including the Halls, fell into another mistake when they said that Miss Paston had grown haughty, because she would not so much as show herself at a great gathering of the fa mily, invited in her honour to Garnet Lodge. She excused herself on the plea of her mourning \u2014 a plea very valid to her, but quite invalid to the circle she disappointed."], [186, "176 Noblesse Oblige. The world went fast at Folksbridge, where a precariousness hung about many of the fortunes and establishments. Exuberance of display, and activity in the pursuit of pleasure, combined with deficiency of reti cence, and incapacity for independent exist ence, were conspicuous in the inhabitants. Their mourning was at once the deepest in point of crape, and the curtest in point of time, that wealth and decency would per mit. The mourners in their very weeds rushed into company to drive away regret, in a style which, to Ph\u0153be's mind, was more like heathen callousness than Christian re signation. To this excitement which Ph\u0153be was un willingly creating in Folksbridge, Lord Wriothesley gave only a modest encourage ment in the way of demonstration of his love. There was a pretty little country house situated within ei\"ht miles of the town. It was no better than a cottage-ornee ; but it was half sneered at, half envied, be cause it was somehow unattainable by the villa architects of Folksbridge. It was"], [187, "In Folksbridge. 177 named Phantasy, and w7as a fanciful appen dage of that Essex branch of the Exmoor family, from the stem of which Mrs. Edge cumbe was a worse-of-the-wear, wild shoot.

Lord Wriothesley came down to Phantasy this autumn for coursing, and duly paid his respects at Higham, in No. 9, Stephenson Street. The member of an affable, noble family, in the case of the recent widowhood of an old re tainer, might have gone this far, had there been no \" beautiful Miss Paston \" in exist ence.

A little more brusqueness where he had always been brusque, and a little involun tary hardness in his tone, were the only indications of what was in his mind. Ph\u0153be was satisfied that Barty was cured of what she called his old fancy for her. She thought that he had perhaps grown to despise himself for the fleeting folly.

She did not wonder that Barty had shaken off his thraldom. He could have thought of her only as a weak, vain girl, caught by the mere elegance and state of a bridegroom far above her in rank. She did not think she had afforded him any indications of a worthier and loftier ambition. She had been a spoiled, petted girl to him, showing herself quite incapable of appreciating the"], [197, "Glimpses of Rest. 187 generous devotion of a heart like that of her father's friend. It did not yet enter into her head, fond as she was of Lord Wriothesley, and peni tent to him for the impatience with which his kindness was apt to fill her, that there could be any other comparison between the two \u2014 any preference for Lord Wriothesley over Barty Wooler, except what belonged to Lord Wriothesley's rank and its great possession. She came across traces \u2014 significant traces they looked to her \u2014 of Barty Wooler, apart from his relations to them. There was his name, along with those of his old grand uncles, the Clays, on the face of the great block of stone and lime which constituted their establishment. It was not ornamental. Folksbridge had hardly begun to be orna mental in its business architecture. It was what was perhaps better \u2014 solid and sub stantial, although rather hideous to an ar tist's eye. Ph\u0153be never entered the build ing, or passed it oftener than she could help, though it was a place to which women as"], [198, "Noblesse Oblige. 188 well as men resorted. When she was ob liged to do so, she saw Barty Wooler at sundry times making common cause with the mercers and their hundred and odd assist ants. She was sure he was entering hotly into the questions of manager, foreman, cashiers, \u2014 as her father had prophesied that Barty must do in his late alliance with trade. Ph\u0153be had glimpses of the man she knew, and had first hailed as her Wellfield com patriot. He struck her as burly among the small, slight, town apprentices, and, beside their pallid faces, his skin seemed bronzed with the artist encampments of a quarter of a century. Sometimes he would pass across the pavement to the Clays' carriage, with one of his old, wizened kinsmen, David or Jonathan Clay, leaning on his arm, and, de laying, stand on the steps to finish a discus sion, in which the younger man was the more excited. But she had never happened to see Barty enter the carriage, and drive off to the villas and country-houses which the Clays patronized, like the other wealthy"], [199, "Glimpses of Rest. 189 citizens of Folksbridge. On the contrary, she had heard the Halls exclaiming at the pride \u2014 or was it misanthropy ? \u2014 which had induced him to fit up some rooms on the third story of the house of business, to be used by him as lodgings when he was in Folksbridge. It was all in character with the vein of defiance, which, along with a broad love of fair-play, ran through and marbled the Eng lish granite of Barty Wooler's nature. He had begun by defying the trade world, re presented to him by his wealthy uncles, and by choosing the comparatively poor and ar duous profession of an artist. Since then he had defied more than one turn in his for tunes, while he had allowed them to tell upon him. Now he was setting at nought the whole artist world, with all its traditions and precedents, in becoming a tradesman at the eleventh hour. He was a queer, contradictory, vehement fellow. He submitted to authority after it had ceased to be authority, but always turn ed more or less upon himself when the fit"], [200, "Noblesse Oblige. 190 seized him, vindicating his regardlessness alike of his interests and his inclinations. He was a man to do noble things, without being accredited noble, in what appeared as his in consistency. A good, stubborn, impulsive man, who made no bones of his goodness, and whom the world took at his own slight ing valuation. The months wore on till there was a spring feeling in the murky air. Little Bess gave up her dormouse sleep, and whimpered and pulled at Ph\u0153be's gown to be taken out. Lads and lasses, on holidays, returned from long tramps to the country with green boughs in their hands, and hawthorn blossoms in their breasts. The sunshine, for many hours each day, poured down on the masts in the river, thick as the tree stems in a forest, on its oily waters, reaching down, it might be, through the brown, slimy depths, and warming the hearts of the great company of steel-blue mussels at anchor in its rocky bed. Ph\u0153be, from the narrow view across the"], [201, "Glimpses of Rest. 191 monotonous street, now became familiar with every pot of balsams and stocks, every box of sweet-peas and mignonette, down to a seedling nettle in a crevice of one of the sills of her opposite neighbour. They set her wondering what the flowering shrubs which could be cultivated in the halls and conservatories of Piccadilly and Park Lane were like in their May and June bloom, to those who looked into them every morning, as Lady Dorothea did. She began to long for what she herself knew of the greenery of the great park of Brockcotes \u2014 the grand chorus of its singers, including hoarse caws of rooks, and mellow coos of ringdoves, the purple flush of its American garden, merging into the English shrubbery, heavy with fra grance, and all passing into the far stretch of waving green. These were outside charms. In the vastness of the chase there were bosky nooks, only to be found by the diligent seeker, where were to be gathered, in their seasons, wealth of March and April daffodils and violets, May lily of the valley June dog-roses, July and August wild honeysuckle, Septem-"], [202, "192 Noblesse Oblige. ber and October foxgloves, November and December crabs and holly -berries, half buried in the snow, and mistletoe hanging with icicles. Again, as early as January and February, there were pale stars of prim roses, to be followed by the misty blue of hyacinths, till the whole sweet calendar of the year was completed. All these treasures were to be had for the taking, not only by the fallow-deer, and the Scotch cattle, but by the humblest labourer's child who trotted with the pitcher containing daddy's coffee or broth up the Wellfield avenue, or strayed into the adjoining nooks; while Ph\u0153be, whom the world gave out as the future mistress of Brockcotes, pined in her Folksbridge lodg ings for the sight and the smell of the most insignificant bud of them all. The sympathy with the living world of nature, which made animals and plants such a pleasure to Ph\u0153be, aroused her at last to look about with real interest and eagerness for the house which her mother and she were to occupy as a permanent home. It was difficult to find what would meet the"], [203, "Glimpses of Rest. 193 requirements of both the women. Mrs. Paston wanted it to be as stylish as Garnet Lodge, on a small scale, and, above all things, to be situated in a cheerful and good visiting neighbourhood. Ph\u0153be, again, desired the humblest pretence at a country view, though it were but that of a nursery garden, or the hedge-rows, and the furze, and gorse bushes of a washing-green, such as had flourished in Wooers' Alley ; above all, with a bit of garden wholly to themselves. She would prefer the house to be an old house, and near one of the older churches, built when Folksbridge was a little nest of mari ners, and not a huge hive of merchants. But the Halls insisted that the house should be near them, and that confined the Pastons to one suburb in their house -hunting. At last something like the model house was alighted on. It was in a sunshiny lane, which was yet sufficiently cheery. It stood in a tiny plot of lawn and flower-border, which Ph\u0153be might well-nigh mow and cultivate by her own unaided exertions, and where little Bess could disport herself, and VOL. III. o"], [204, "Noblesse Oblige. 194 be chased away twenty times a day from committing trespasses. Lastly, No. 3 Dean Lane was within ten minutes' walk of the pine-apple crowned pillars at the avenue-gate of Garnet Lodge. The only thing wanting was an old battlemented church-militant, to remind Ph\u0153be of St. Basil's, and of Lord Wriothesley's comparison of St. Basil's to Albrecht Durer's Knight defyinig Death and the Devil. But Ph\u0153be, like a wise woman, decided that everything could not be had, either for her or any other person's money, and was content with what she had got."], [205, "Foreshadowings. 195 CHAPTER XIV. Foreshadowings. IT surprised Ph\u0153be a little that the Halls \u2014 and particularly Olive \u2014 had not taken a more active part in the search for the house. They had retired a good deal within themselves, leaving the Pastons, after one stipulation, to make their own choice. She was not aware that the Halls were offended and huffy, as they were rather given to be, when the Pastons acted against their opinion, or, indeed, had so much as an opinion of their own on any oc casion. They had appeared preoccupied, too, when Ph\u0153be visited them lately. She would have thought they were engrossed preparing for their own sea-side trip, had not Olive let fall a word which indicated o 2"], [206, "Noblesse Oblige. 196 that they were not going to the sea-side at all this summer. Their remaining at home must be on Jane's behalf; but Mrs. Connel had recovered very well, if she would only believe it, and her baby was healthy and thriving. It might be for Frank's sake. He had been down for two days during the last month, and was so busy that he had not found his way to Stephenson Street, Higham, to inquire for his aunt and cousin, though Ph\u0153be had not as yet given him any warning to drop cousinly terms. But Frank was not likely to get into any diffi culty, and his marriage, if he were going to be married, would not detain the Halls at Garnet Lodge for the summer. It might be Olive's marriage, or Kate's ; but with re gard to such an engagement, Ph\u0153be felt certain that the Halls would have confided it to her, unless it were a very poor mar riage ; and Ph\u0153be was convinced that no other of the Halls would make a poor mar riage after Jane's experience. Mrs. Connel had not bettered her position, except by be ing a matron ; and the Halls were as ambi-"], [207, "Foreshadowings. 197 tious in their way as Ph\u0153be had been in hers. Moreover, Jane had been forced to relin quish a few things, after which she was al ways crying in the accents of a repining martyr. The family had been brought up luxuriously, but the luxuries had still some what of the charm of novelties and rarities to them, so that they kept clutching at them, and took no delight in the freshness and the freedom of New-found-lands of their own making, like Lady Dorothea. But no ; Ph\u0153be did not think Kate or Olive was going to be married at all. On the contrary, she had a suspicion that some prospects of an advantageous marriage for Kate had gone off without fulfilment, al though it had been proudly hinted at in Ph\u0153be's presence that the sisters might not seem altogether behind the future Countess of Exmoor. Naturally this conclusion would mortify the women of the family, and might cause them to look out of spirits and fretted, as they had certainly looked the last time Ph\u0153be was with them. But why not go to the sea-side when change was more desir-"], [208, "Noblesse Oblige. 198 able than ever? The Halls had always confessed that the air of Garnet Lodge was relaxing, and the streets of Folksbridge in tolerable in the summer. Two ladies living in retirement were as little likely as cloistered nuns to hear much of importance that was passing around them. Ph\u0153be's walks were not in the direction of the noisy quays. She was so superficially acquainted with them, that even if she had gone where casks, boxes, and bales, porters, sailors, merchants' clerks, and supercargos stopped the way, she would have been no wiser. She would have failed to remark the number of vessels lying idle in the docks, and, what was worse, the number of men who had mouths to be fed, and the filling of many more helpless mouths de pending on their work, hanging about, pinched, haggard, and unemployed. She read with no more than passing attention the cautiously-worded announcements of bad trade that began to appear in the Folksbridge Gazette. Yet she reproached herself, with some reason, for having been"], [209, "Foreshadowings. 199 selfishly unobservant, and engrossed with her own sorrow, when she learned at length that a season of commercial difficulty and sore distress was passing over the bowed heads of the crowd around her. Many a brain was racked with anxiety \u2014 many a heart was aching with disappointment. Humble households were enduring the ex tremity of privation. Fortunes won by the enterprise and the industry of long years were scattered in a day. Among other fortunes, that of Mr. Hall, who had been a bold, as well as a fortunate speculator, was sacrificed. It was her mother's loud lamentations which aroused her to the fact that they were involved in Mr. Hall's partial ruin. Mr. Hall himself had come over to Stephenson Street, and broken the unwelcome news to the Pastons. Ph\u0153be had been filled with a mixture of admiration and pity for the brave face which the merchant put upon adversity, while he could not altogether keep down the careworn and crestfallen misery that had taken the place of the old confidence"], [210, "200 Noblesse Oblige. and self-satisfaction. She did not want her uncle's excited assurances that all would be well, and the murmured earnestness of his promises that the Pastons' substance should be made good while a penny of his own remained to him. But if, in Mr. Hall's presence, poor Mrs. Paston was loud and sharp in her exclama tions and wearisome questions, the moment he went away she broke out piteously. She lamented the waste of Mr. Paston's hard earned savings ; she reproached her brother's abuse of the trust put in his business know ledge, which would reduce her and her child to dependence and destitution. Pas ton (who would not have let a breath of wind blow on her that he could have warded off, poor soul !) would not be able to rest in his grave. Ph\u0153be had never seen her mother so agitated. All the strength as well as all the weakness of the woman was up in arms. All her pride in the genteel station to which her husband had brought her, all the lately found faith in his devotion to her, and in"], [211, "Foreshadowings. 201 the power which had backed his will to shelter her, all her care for her child, made common cause with her constitutional shrink ing from exertion and deprivation of every kind. To Ph\u0153be it sounded as if her mother immensely exaggerated the danger. It was not long till a letter arrived for Mrs. Paston from Frank Hall in London. It was to the same effect as his father's communi cation \u2014 a manly, kinsman-like letter, express ing sympathy with his father, and calmly con fronting, for himself and mother and sisters, the change which the last six weeks had wrought in their fortunes, and proposingto re fund the Pastons' capital in time. He admitted that the loss might never be made good, but he solemnly declared that while he must now work hard and depend entirely on his profession, Mrs. Paston and Ph\u0153be need be under no apprehension for their resources. Although he should starve, or his own sis ters go out into the world and work for their bread, the interest of his uncle Paston's money should be paid to his uncle's family. That same day Barty Wooler appeared in"], [212, "Noblesse Oblige. 202 Stephenson Street with liberal cheques forMr. Paston's two best pictures, which he had dis posed of, and with a proposal that he should set about completing the unfinished picture of the execution of the rebel lords, getting a spare room from the Pastons' landlady, and using it as a temporary painting-room until he could have from Ph\u0153be the sittings for Lord Balmerino's Peggy, according to her father's design. Within the week Ph\u0153be received a letter from Lady Dorothea, soliciting that her mind might be set at rest with regard to her position as to the trade calamities in Folks bridge. The Exmoors had heard of them in London (as they heard of everything at Brockcotes), and were exceedingly sorry to find that Mr. Hall, among other merchants, had been a sufferer. The letter ended with a delicately frank protest lest Ph\u0153be should think it strange that Lady Dorothea's father wished to settle on the widow and the daughter of Lord Exmoor's old and es teemed friend one of the annuities constant ly and fitly charged on the Exmoor estates."], [213, "Foreshadowings. 203 Ph\u0153be's e}7es were opened to her having part and lot in the disastrous year at Folks bridge. The first thing she saw clearly was that her mother and she must for the present give up any thought of a pleasant house and servants of their own in Dean Lane. They must continue in the dull, confined lodgings in Stephenson Street, and must also look about in case worse should befall them, and they should be forced to become pensioners on Lord Exmoor's or Barty Wooler's bounty till they were burnt up by the coals of fire heaped on their heads. This was a bitter enough draught to swal low at the first gulp, and Ph\u0153be's gorge rose against it. She did not say a wrong had been done, or an injustice committed. But it depressed her to think of being con demned to Stephenson Street for summers and winters, for years and years, after she had found heart to search for and to dis cover something like a home. How nice and quiet and fresh the middle-aged house in the garden, among other houses in gar dens and shrubberis, looked to her now, as"], [214, "Noblesse Oblige. 204 it was seen in retrospect, compared with the new, thickly-peopled locality of Stephenson Street ! What a mockery it seemed to her to say she would ever be a great lady, though all her father's fortune was but such a mere drop in the bucket of the Latimers' funds, and the loss of it could not weigh above a straw in the relation between her and Lord Wriothesley ! And she guessed that it was Lord Wriothesley who had supplied his sis ter with the information on which he knew well the Earl and Lady Dorothea, irrespect ive of him, would write and act exactly as they had done, and were prepared to do. Then Ph\u0153be thought better of it, and made herself regard with commiseration the faces around her, \u2014 of those compared with whose sufferings hers were light. She remem bered, on the last occasion when she was at Garnet Lodge, the additional wrinkles on her uncle's face, and her aunt's complaint of so severe a headache as might account for dim eyes. She wondered what her cousins \u2014 what even Frank and Jane \u2014 would do with out the old superfluities, the old handsome"], [215, "Foreshadowings. 205 allowances. At last she was driven back to contrast such trials as these with that of her relinquishing the house in Dean Lane, until she smiled a little sadly at the disproportion between the two, and still more at the convic tion of how her mother and the Halls would cry her down, as romantic and unpractical, if they knew that she would gladly accept her present loss, and all future similar losses, so that she could buy back, not the inevitable, but the experience which had travelled in its train. As Ph\u0153be's eyes opened, Mrs. Paston's closed. The perturbation of her mind sank as quickly as it had risen. She received Frank Hall's consolation, Barty Wooler's payment, and Lady Dorothea's suggestion, as being so many gospels, each proclaiming a way of escape, and a provision for the future. It required all Ph\u0153be's arguments to pre vent her mother insisting on going on with the taking of the house. \"Mamma, Frank Hall means what he writes,\" said Ph\u0153be ; \" and he may be able to keep his word by the time he is fifty."], [216, "206 Noblesse Oblige. But the Halls know- as little what self-denial is as most people know. Do you think it can be easy to learn it at thirty, though one is a clever journalist ? Twenty years are not too long a time ; until then I am sure poor Frank will want his bones for his own dogs. Of course starving is a pleasant fiction to a man who has been accustomed to soup a la Julienne, and iced coffee, a high seat perched on wheels, a hunter when he fancied one, and a betting-book within modest limits. Then he has had his choice little library, his literary clubs, his runs over the Continent ; and no blame to Frank for being used to these things, since he did not abuse them, and they were quite within his means and ex pectations till this summer.\" \" Well, if Frank is not as good as his word \u2014 though I do not see why you should dis trust him \u2014 there is Barty Wooler, Ph\u0153be, who has brought us seventeen hundred pounds this week for the sale of two pictures. One thousand seven hundred pounds for two pictures !\" \"Yes, mamma, \"but there are only a"], [217, "Foreshadowings. 207 very few more pictures, and the stock will be exhausted at last.\" \" Child, one would think you make trou bles. Is there not the annuity which Lord Exmoor is going to settle on me ? \u2014 and a handsome income it will be, for the Ex moors always do things handsome.

It is like provid ing for their own, when a certain wooing, which has been mighty long a-doing indeed \u2014 more's the pity \u2014 comes off.\" \"Mamma,\" pled Ph\u0153be, \" do you not see how unlikely, how impossible such a thing is? How could we be at once Lord Ex moor's pensioners, and the obstacle between Lord Wriothesley and his father's hopes for his son ?\" \" If you intend me to think that the Ex moor annuity would be to buy us up, and prevent you ever listening to Lord Wriothes ley's addresses,\" protested Mrs. Paston, \" why, I can't and won't think anything so base of the Brockcotes family, which we"], [218, "Noblesse Oblige. 208 have always found so kind ; and Lady Doro thea as good as an own sister to you, you ungrateful girl. If it is pride and jealousy which won't let you be obliged to the Earl and the Countess, I can only say, Miss Pas ton, pride comes before a fall, and yours, as well as others', is not far distant.\" \"Perhaps I have had my fall already,\" declared Ph\u0153be, softly and sadly. \" There is one thing I am absolutely certain of, mamma ; it is not for fear of risking my dig nity that I would not take assistance from Lord Exmoor, or any other person, till I had need of it, and so rob needier claim ants. I believe I should not mind throwing my dignity, as you call it, to the winds,\" added Ph\u0153be wistfully, \"if that were all. I might even receive Lord Exmoor's wages to-morrow, supposing everybody would im mediately acknowledge that they would dis qualify me from rising to the height of him and his, and if I should be for ever freed from this irksome persecution,\" said Ph\u0153be passionately. \" I do not know what to make of you,"], [219, "Foreshadowings. 209 Ph\u0153be Paston,\" asserted Mrs. Paston, at the crying point, and with her widow's cap very much awry ; \" unless you are speaking for speaking's sake, or on purpose to vex me.

I have always had an idea, when I watched Lady Exmoor working at the Countesses's hangings, that I could manage something of the kind, become an adept in the old slow stitches, and acquit myself with greater distinction there than you could. Of course it is dreadfully vain of me to say"], [227, "Foreshadowings. 217 this, but I think the grouping and the shad ing might come naturally to me as papa's daughter. You know I could sit by mam ma, and attend to her while I did the em broidery. If our purse were really drained, do you believe I could compass so very easy a mode of replenishing it ? Tell me frankly, Lady Dorothea.\" Ph\u0153be had pleasure in writing thus plain ly to Lady Dorothea, and proposing for her self work which Thorpie would almost scorn \u2014 more pleasure (though it was of a stern kind, which women do not often feel, but feel keenly, if at all), than in putting Barty Wooler on his guard, and receiving his re tort in return, as she did when he called that same evening. \" Our receipts are all given in good faith,\" Ph\u0153be put in shyly to the most formidable of her allies and defenders. \" Poverty has not come into the house yet, Mr. Wooler.

It was a little indemnification to Ph\u0153be to read something of Barty Wooler in another letter from Lady Dorothea. The something was not in the first paragraph. \" I am so glad that Mr. Wooler is con ducting the sale of your father's pictures \" (as a matter of course, that also had come to Lady Dorothea's ears). \" He is the proper person in every respect.\" (\" I know what she means by that phrase,\" Ph\u0153be told herself, bitterly, as she read the letter. \" I wronder what he would think now, if he heard her! She is very provoking, Lady Dorothea, although she is good.\") \" If you knew it, I have grown from having a cool respect to having an immense opinion of Mr. Wooler. I can tell you a charming story in illustration of his superiority. I am not aware (perhaps you can tell me) whether the Messrs.

Be that as it may, when the report that Mr. Blount was going out to settle in Canada reached Folksbridge, Mr. Wooler straightway wrote to him, expressing his faith in the resources of Canada, and proposing to invest capital in land, which he should hold, as a business speculation. Papa and other friends were prepared to come forward with almost any amount of loan which Mr. Blount would accept ; but naturally he preferred the accommodation offered by Mr. Wooler, which could be treated entirely as a matter of business, and would leave the debtor under less obligation. \" All things considered, I think the act was a very noble and generous one, and I, for one, am Mr. Wooler's very humble servant for it. The story deserves a place in some family's annals. Who knows but that Mr. Wooler, if he make another hundred thou sand in trade, will not found a family ?

Ph\u0153be rejoiced in the know ledge, though she could not claim any per sonal interest in it.

It was not that Olive had the faintest notion of deceiving the public, or of continu ing to contract expenses which Mr. Hall could no longer afford. All she sought was to throw a becoming veil over their losses, and to preserve the essentials for remaining in the first society of Folksbridge, only a few of the members of which had been brought as near insolvency as Mr. Hall. It would be a severe struggle, with all their keeping up of appearances, to maintain their position, and not fall out of their orbits. Olive made the admission with some sarcasm to Ph\u0153be. \" There is so much of give-and-take in Folksbridge society \u2014 I cannot call it hospi tality. Then there is such a pressure from the classes below ours ; and the lines of de marcation are so fine and delicate, that no lady in our set can very well relax her rules, or drop her privileges.

It is a kind of sham, but still it serves the purpose. In the course of a year or two I hope papa will have re covered some of his bad debts, and retrieved his dead losses. He is bent on doing it, dear old man.\" \"And that is a most honourable object to strive for when others are concerned. I have no doubt he will succeed,\" said Ph\u0153be. \" Well, I hope so, Ph\u0153be ; but do you notice how old he is looking ? though, thank God, he is hale and hearty still. But his aim is confined to preserving and restoring the firm. In the meantime, if we do not go out and have people here occasionally, we will dwindle into nobodies, and it won't signify how much money we may have scraped together again after we are grey-headed.

I should have dinned this into your ears, Ph\u0153be, but you seemed inclined to take a flight above us. We cannot follow your ex ample ; none of us can hope to have an earl's son for a string to her bow.\" Olive, with all her self-confidence, had a fundamental want of independence and self respect, which rendered her subservient to the demands of her society. She was now pre pared to push and plead for a station which she had formerly without jostling or schem ing. Neither was it altogether from selfish motives on her part. She did it with a con viction that it was for the general interest of the family, and especially for the interest of Kate. Kate was very much prostrated by the change which had come. It had cost Kate \"a true, true love,\" in addition to a great many indulgences which she had highly prized. She was not capable of the self-restraint and the disinterested regard for others which would have prevented her going about woe-begone and discontented, or lying back in her chair listless and peevish, unless she"], [235, "Change upon Change. 225 was drawn out of herself, and excited by the prospect of a little subdued gaiety and amusement. She was not beyond these con solations, but she could not respond to any others. Her very music, for which she had stimulated and cultivated so passionate a taste, when it could no longer serve as an occasion for display, was neglected and for sworn. She was the most delicate member of the family, and if she could not be roused and cheered, her health was certain to suffer. But Olive assured Ph\u0153be that Kate, how ever much she might complain of her share of the enforced family retirement this sum mer, behaved much better than Jane. Jane, now that she could levy no more contributions, and reap no more advantages, from the paternal home, drew off from the trouble at Garnet Lodge, and entrenched herself in her separate family circle, and her individual responsibilities and duties.

Jane could tell Olive and Kate that it took every far thing, with changed days, too, to suffice for her, and Walter, and baby, cook, housemaid, and nurse. In place of the monstrousness and the meanness of talking of their doing on less, and removing into a smaller house, Jane wondered Olive and Kate did not give up their pocket-money. She was con vinced they had no need of it. They had gowns and bonnets enough to serve them for years and years. As to cab-hires, which she supposed the girls must pay now, gloves, and shoes, and bouquets \u2014 for, of course, the conservatory at Garnet Lodge would be put down \u2014 she did think that the less her sisters were seen out this season they would be the more thought of. It was a different thing with her. She had her husband's wishes and advantages to look to. She had been astonished, shocked, when she heard that Kate had appeared, played, and sung at Mrs. Mill's, just seven weeks after the news-"], [237, "Change upon Change. 227 papers had taken upon them to publish \u2014 (and why could Frank not stop that?) \u2014 that papa was involved to the extent of twenty-two thousand with the Newlands, and thirteen thousand with the Jays' New York house. If Olive and Kate had either means or time to spare, they might think of assisting her, with her poor health, and her darling Wally, whom they had begun bymaking sucha fuss about, and Walter, to whom papa's losses were such a miserable disappointment. Walter had thought of having a share in the business. It was a mercy he had not got one. But if his salary were to be meddled with, really Walter must make up his mind, and transfer his services elsewhere. It would be a trial to leave her father ; but Walter owed his first duty to his wife and child, and nobody could say that he failed in his duty. \" It is Jane all over,\" Olive commented. \" Whoever heard of Walter Connel's be ing of so much consequence as to be con sulted and deferred to, till her family had no more loaves and fishes at their dis- Q2"], [238, "Noblesse Oblige. 228 posal? People write of the selfishness of single men and women, but I think it can never match the barefaced selfishness of married couples.

She could not stay away from Garnet Lodge, and had not appetite or rest if she was not half her time here. I need not tell you, Ph\u0153be, that our servants and our carriage were as much hers as our own. Now, she will not lend mamma her housemaid on washing-days, or come and sit an hour and chat with Kate, when I have to be out as much incognito as I can keep myself, making the markets and doing the shopping, which Prain used to spare us. In addition to entertaining the Connel's com- pany, we have had to fight their battles for them ; and we have lost some of the best friends we ever had because Walter Connel chose to quarrel with them, be spiteful, and bear malice, and ride out on our backs, like the man he is.\""], [239, "Change upon Change. 229 Times and persons were changed since Ph\u0153be went to Folksbridge to school. She had been struck with the pleasant things on every side of her in the rich merchant's house. She had thought her cousins were, on the whole, very happy in themselves and in each other \u2014 attractive, agreeable girls, just entering on the gala whirl of young ladies' engagements and entertainments, unstinted and glorified in their case with the worldly glory of their father's growing wealth. Had Ph\u0153be not known something of the earnestness and enthusiasm of the artist's home at Wellfield, she might have been tempted to envy her cousins then. Now, she was driven to conclude ruefully, that all the Halls, unless perhaps Frank, were de teriorating rapidly under the ordeal to which they had been subjected. Yet it might be but the fermenting of the grape juice before it passes into more generous wine. In God's providence, good is wrought out of evil, though the evil-doers bear their punishment. Jane Connel might grow wiser and more tender. Olive's craving for vain show and"], [240, "230 Noblesse Oblige. frivolity might in a measure be redeemed by its being exercised for Kate's sake, and often on Kate's sole behoof. The sisterly regard, in its motherliness, might draw Olive still more to her mother and father, and enlist her more than ever in their cause. If Kate had lost a lover, she had gained a friend in Olive. And was there not something to be said even for the loss of the lover ? Olive had explained to Ph\u0153be that his father had thrown obstacles in the way of a portionless bride being taken home by the dandy young merchant, who, in company with other young merchants, had his moor, his hunting box, and his yacht for Norwegian fiords. Woodford's house could not afford a son's settling down on its resources alone, at this time, any more than another. The with drawal before the suitor had committed him self by a proposal, had been made in a half blustering, half-shrinking fashion, and with no redeeming grace of nobility to varnish over the native ugliness of the deed. But was it altogether different from Lady Doro thea's renunciation of Mr. Blount ?"], [241, "Change upon Change. 231 Might it not be a trial, like the other losses, of which there was at least the possibility that it might develop better seed of better fruit ? Might not Kate and Mr. Woodford each recognise the unworthiness of the other, and awake to greater worth in a third man or woman ? Or might they not remember and be faithful, and turn to each other again, infinitely better worth having than each had been originally ? If God gives His rain to the parched ground of the unjust, is not the discipline of His providence also the break ing up of the fallow heart, and the giving another and yet another chance to poor hu manity ? As a proof of it there was Ph\u0153be's Aunt Hall. It began to do Ph\u0153be good to see her mounting spectacles on her Roman nose. Aunt HaU had always been inclined to treat infirmities, whether her own or other people's, with a high hand ; and had found fault with Mrs. Paston for using an eye-glass in reading the service in her prayer-book. Yet she now mounted spectacles as if she had dropped all thought of the eminence and lustre of Batty and Wingfield, while in"], [242, "232 Noblesse Oblige. reality she had never been more essentially, though paradoxically, a Wingfield than when she was out and out a Hall. She was giv ing her whole heart, if God would, to the restoration of her husband's house. In her new regard for his health and peace, she condescended even to employ her spectacles to read the newspapers to him, to win him from his broodings. If Mr. Hall lived to attain to large profits again, he might be gentler in his second victory, and more tolerant of beaten men. Frank, in his turn, might prove less sharp and mocking, less in credulous of any wisdom that did not come within the ken of his bat's eyes. But with all sympathy and forbearance, Ph\u0153be found visits to the Lodge, at the rate O 7 of three a week (fewer the Halls would deem neglect), somewhat of a pull on her kinswo manly goodwill, when she was allowed to see her aunt engrossed, Olive worried, and Kate nervous. It was something that it was sum mer, and that last season's prize-roses \u2014 great globes of every shade, from creamy-white to purple-black \u2014 blossomed as sweetly and"], [243, "Change upon Change. 233 throve as luxuriantly as if the Halls had not committed them to the care of a jobbing gardener. In Stephenson Street, on the contrar)7, the old nymphs of the seasons had become fast young ladies, and were already run to seed in straggling nastur tiums and woody geraniums, brought to premature ripeness in an oven of stone and lime. Notwithstanding, she was always glad to get back to the dull lodgings which were her home, and to the mother who was look ing out and wearying for her. And she had other reasons for hurrying back. She had to give sittings to Barty Wooler, \u2014 appointments in which it would have ill-become her to fail. She was not to be kept at Garnet Lodge, then, by Kate Hall's little cross speeches. Poor Kate had always taken umbrage at Ph\u0153be's rival claims to beauty, and did not omit to remind her pet tishly that she was well off to have nothing more serious than her picture to occupy her. She wondered that she could think it worth while to have her picture taken again, when it had been so frequently done before. But"], [244, "234 Noblesse Oblige. Ph\u0153be ought to know best. Oh! yes; a young lady with such a grand experience might very well be trusted to judge for herself, and to instruct others. For her part, she did not believe she would ever have the heart to be so much as photo graphed again, though everybody admitted that no photographer had ever done her justice. She had always intended to ask her poor uncle to make a sketch of her ; and she would have prized such a thing from his hands, since the sketch of her in water-colours, done by Marks when she was a girl, was a frightful daub. These sittings had become the great events of Ph\u0153be's quiet life. They were to her a mingled torment and joy."], [245, "A Feather in Barty s Cap. 235 CHAPTER XVI. A Feather in Barty s Cap. IT was not in Mrs. Paston's nature to see Barty Wooler in Stephenson Street without a revival in her mind of her first destination of Ph\u0153be. There was a violent relapse into all her old vacillation with regard to Lord Wriothesley's long pro tracted courtship. The doubts even went to the extent of a temporary abjuring of the young peer's cause. Ph\u0153be had to listen once more to a confused medley of regrets and reproaches, and a multitude of oracular deliverances, to the effect that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, together with almost jaunty assurances that there was life in the old love till the clergyman shook him self into his surplice, and received the ring from the new bridegroom. Then followed"], [246, "236 Noblesse Oblige. a repetition of Mrs. Paston's simple schemes and arts, which she had ample time to play off on Barty Wooler ; for she chose, as she said, with a little nod of her ill-balanced head, to chaperon her daughter in the spare room in the lodgings, where Barty Wooler had for the time set up his easel. Mrs. Paston installed herself as duenna at a respectful distance, so that, while she pre served propriety, she would not be in the way if something did happen. Ph\u0153be had to shut her eyes to these man\u0153uvres, and struggle to believe that Barty Wooler's eyes were shut to them like wise while she had to be constantly on the watch to out-man\u0153uvre her mother. In the midst of her suffering she remembered clearly and sorrowfully all her former suffer ings from the same cause, and the impa tient resentment and rancour which they had produced in her. Barty Wooler really paid very little heed to Mrs. Paston's fancies. He was kind and equal in his behaviour to his friend's widow. And it was not as if he were soliciting her"], [247, "A Feather in Barty s Cap. 237 favour, but as if he remembered whose wife she had been, and had acquired a regard for her on her own account. He was more cordial with her than he was with his friend's daughter. But neither did he forget that he was a gentleman, wdth a claim to the title of an old friend, \u2014 only in these sittings Barty Wooler did not show himself in his plea santest humour. He was dry, and appeared hard and scornful. He was like a genial man who, when he is not himself, overacts his part. Ph\u0153be tried to be her father's daugh ter to him under provocation, and never to forget that she owed him atonement. But she was not able to see and judge her self as another saw and judged her. She was not aware that her early brightness, and even sauciness, were subdued into a timidity which did not propitiate a man of Barty Wooler's constitution, but galled him. He was al ways formally apologising for the number of sittings he had to ask, though there was not one more than was absolutely necessary, as if she must be heartily tired of their task. He was for ever railing at the obligations of"], [248, "238 Noblesse Oblige. a sitting \u2014 the long-continued pose, the com pulsory yielding to be looked at, the dis order of the veritable workshop. He per sisted in taking it for granted that all these were odious to Ph\u0153be. If he had only known how her heart warmed at realising the least of them again. They were far more than native air and the scenes of her childhood to her. They were dear with all sacred, tender dearness. She sat in the very primrose dress which she had worn as Molly Lepel, feeling it gar ish and gaudy after her mourning. She was looking down, holding with a drooping hand the handkerchief Barty had given her to hold, as Peggy, wife of Lord Balmerino, whom the stout old lord permitted to come and have a last look at him on his way to execution. Ph\u0153be was a world too refined for the homely, somewhat coarse, sensational heroine of the '45 ; but her air was not alto gether out of keeping with the subject of the picture. All the time Ph\u0153be was thinking how much she would give to belong once more"], [249, "A Feather in Barty s Cap. 239 to a painter's household, with art for its rul ing worldly interest. How far Lady Doro thea had been right when she maintained that there was a fitness and propriety in a painter's daughter allying herself with paint ers. How far she had herself been wrong in imagining that it would be so much sweeter and more satisfactory to overleap the gulf, and be a great lady among great lords. She felt that Barty's bluntness, as he went about his work, had a charm for her, and moved her, as she never could be moved, by the courteous patience and soft ness of the Exmoor class of men towards their women, though it had once been this quality she had most admired. She said to herself in her folly that, hearts being equal, she would rather be scolded by the one than praised by the other. The fact was, that the aristocratic position, with its instincts and influences, was foreign and strange to her, notwithstanding her half adoption into it, and her reverence for it.

Love, and love alone, could cross securely the chasm between class and class. Ph\u0153be granted this; but then it must be love very genuine and very unmistakable. Barty went so far as to hurt Ph\u0153be by scouting at the historical scene in which she was to be grouped. He wondered that her father had introduced her into such a set. Kilmarnock had proved himself a quailing weakling. Balmerino was a blustering old sinner. And my Lady Townsend was there as a brutally corrupt woman of fashion ; while a soft, sleek, blaspheming cynic stood on the steps of the scaffold in the guise of George Selwyn. They were a bad lot \u2014 a sorry company to be mixed up with. He looked and spoke as if he had lost the old fairness and moderation which had tem pered his fumes, as if he were putting forth his venom in kicking at the shadowy spectres of poor sinners like himself, and waifs of an evil day. Ph\u0153be no longer contradicted him. She looked up at him in mute appeal and in bland surprise and pain, unwittingly stabbing the possessed man, who, on his part, made her"], [251, "A Feather in Barty s Cap. 241 think him harsh and offended. She could not tell why. It was with amazement, and a dash of shame and distress, that Ph\u0153be discovered that these sittings to Barty, with their vexa tious and unaccountable shortcomings, were more of boons than banes on the brooding summer afternoons which they signalized. Ph\u0153be had some qualifications as a critic, but she could not pretend to judge her own likeness taken by Barty. She believed her father would have said there was the fire of genius in it ; and certainly Barty had not marred his natural gifts by hasty, crude work here. In midst of all his spleen he took pains, causing Ph\u0153be to remember what her father had said of him, that he would do his best for their joint work should he consent to finish it. Looking at the pic ture after it was completed, Ph\u0153be could scarcely realize that this face with the pure brow, the deepening eyes, and the sensitive mouth was her own. Barty's tender like ness of Ph\u0153be was a separate sketch of Ph\u0153be, which was to be transferred to Mr. VOL. III.

When Mrs. Paston ex pressed a wish to see the large picture, it was necessary that she should go with Barty to his rooms in the Clays' place of business, where he had put up his easel to work as continuously as possible. Ph\u0153be attempted to prevent her mother from making the re quest, but, failing in this, she accompanied her mother. It would have looked like af fectation in her to stay away, and she had a desire to see her father's picture again, and not her father's alone, but Barty's also \u2014 one of those tokens of close affectionate friend ship which Flemish artists were fond of leav ing behind them, and from which her father had augured much. As Ph\u0153be went with her mother, she found that there was very much the same bitter sweetness in the visit as there had been in the sittings. It was like the fulfilment of a dream, with all the drawbacks that gene rally wait on such a fulfilment. Messrs. David and Jonathan Clay had ar rived at the point when they felt a pride and"], [253, "A Feather in Barty s Cap. 243 pleasure in their grand-nephew's final sub mission to trade, notwithstanding his accom plishment as an artist. They were disposed to pay the Pastons what Mrs. Paston, in a flutter, regarded as the most gratifying and promising attention. Any misgiving or dis approbation which the old gentlemen might have originally felt at the report which coupled their heir's name with that of Ph\u0153be was quenched in the whispered distinction treading on Ph\u0153be's steps. And not only so, but the greater glory which had put out the less was thrown back and reflected its lustre until it became a feather in Barty's cap, to have found out and sought, al though unsuccessfully, a young lady who had a chance of being one of the proud est peeresses in England. Folksbridge might be devoted to traffic, might be liberal, almost radical in politics, but it had the true English appreciation of aris tocracy. Moreover, old men like the Clays turn naturally to conservatism.

By a few deliber ate changes in height and complexion, and a hundred touches imperceptible to the uniniti ated, he was breaking up and obscuring the portrait, so that, although it might be a great deal nearer to the buxom afflicted Peggy of Lord Balmerino, it could no longer, save with difficulty, be identified as Ph\u0153be Pas ton. \" But, but, Mr. Wooler !\" stammered Mrs. Paston, \" I've not the smallest doubt you are doing the picture every justice, and that this figure isveryfine,indeedadeal more strapping than the original, and I could believe to lift the knot from her breast ; still it is surely not so good a portrait of Ph\u0153be as the small picture is, and you are not making the two the same.

She left it to her mother and the Clays to moralise, which they duly contrived to do. She did not believe the information, as she stood there, with bloodless face, staring blankly before her. Even Barty Wooler, who had been vapouring in his own fashion five minutes before, bent his head, turned away, and began to walk up and down as a vent to his feelings. Lord Wriothesley, who was to be the great man of his house, and from whom so much was looked for, could not, would not die. Ph\u0153be had not so much as heard that he had been ill. When he had been down at Phantasy last autumn, and again when he had stopped there in passing through Folksbridge this summer, he had been perfectly well. But whether Ph\u0153be believed the infor mation or not, she must act upon it. It was a request not to be refused, and not to be delayed in the granting by a single hour.

Yet the bet ter part of a second day would pass before she could reach the Highland station where the Exmoor carriage was to be in waiting for her.

She was hurriedly arranging in her own mind that she would take with her a young woman whom her mother had thought of engaging for a servant in the house in Dean Lane, instead of one of her aunt's servants. \" Let me take charge of you and your maid. It is my part to your father's daugh ter,\" urged Barty, coming forward. \" I shall not be in your way at all, while it will be the easiest thing in the world for me, and it will set your mother's mind at rest.\" Mrs. Paston closed with this offer on the instant ; while she put in a plaintive dogma that her mind \u2014 her mother's mind \u2014 was the very last thing that Ph\u0153be or Lady Dorothea would ever think of. The Messrs.

She was not greatly helped by hav ing to supplement with her own thought her mother's dislocated jumble of prepara tions and injunctions. She was seen away by her mother in solemn testimony to every body's doing his or her duty, and was joined by Barty Wooler at the North station, from which they were to leave in the cool morn ing that was rising over the huge seaport.

Here she was dull to per ceive the mortal enemy with whom Lord Wriothesley should grapple in vain.

Barty did not discuss probabilities with her, or set before her the calamity which was in store. He did not seem to see that it could be asked of him to prepare and warn her for the worst. Enough that he was making the fatigue of the road as light as possible, and carefully ministering to her comfort. He did not obtrude himself on her, but kept as much out of her way as he could. He did not even seek to divert her from her anxiety by pointing out the fea tures of the country, which was new to her, but well known to him. He was studying his railway-guide, reading his newspaper, and leaning back in his corner with his cap over his eyes, thinking his own thoughts,"], [266, "256 Noblesse Oblige. even when the day was drawing to a close, and Ph\u0153be was raising herself mechanically to catch a glimpse of the peerless pictur esqueness of Edinburgh as soon as it dis closed itself. Mrs. Skinner was an old housekeeper of the Exmoors who had married a butler. Instead of having a hotel, she kept furnished lodgings, which were patronised by the family and their friends. Ph\u0153be was quite familiar with her name, and had often writ ten to Lady Dorothea when she was staying at Mrs. Skinner's in Abercromby Place, on her way to or from their shooting-quarters in the North. Mrs. Skinner had got a tele gram apprising her of her guest's coming, and requesting her to be waiting for Ph\u0153be at the station. The two easily recognised each other, and Barty Wooler, with grave punctilio and precise appointment for tlie following morn ing, gave over Ph\u0153be into safe keeping. Mrs. Skinner had neither more particular nor later intelligence from Strathavie than Ph\u0153be herself had received, and was equal-"], [267, "A Sudden Summons. 257 ly satisfied that Lord Wriothesley would not die. No wonder Mrs. Skinner was in credulous, when she remembered the re joicings at his birth, the festival at his chris tening, the sedulousness and success of his rearing, and the triumph of his coming of age. What disturbed the ex-housekeeper was, that the son and heir of Lord Exmoor, with so many fine seats over which it was her boast that she had once helped to preside, should be lying dangerously ill in a hired shooting-box ! Another difficulty was, that while Mrs. Skinner was prepared to show all respect and attention to Ph\u0153be, she was at a loss to determine the extent of it, be cause of her ignorance of the young lady's position in the family, who, in Mrs. Skin ner's eyes, were something more than sove reigns.

But this despatch for Miss Paston seemed to authenticate the rumour ; on the other hand, it might be only a fancy of Lady Dorothea's, for she had her fancies, sensible as she was. It would never do for a person trusted as Mrs. Skinner was to make an awkward mistake. Luckily, Ph\u0153be was too much preoccupied during her short stay to weigh the oscilla tions in Mrs. Skinner's manner, between the astounding suspicion that she was addressing the future Countess of Exmoor, and the more rational conviction that Miss Paston could only be Lady Dorothea's favoured companion."], [269, "A heavy heart makes a long road. 259 CHAPTER XVIII.

But the giant mountains beginning to rise before her, and awe her unaccustomed eyes, frowned upon her in her growing fear, and struck her with an impression of savage ness and horror. Under these grim preci pices, and on these barren wastes, the free dom and the grandeur of which would have chiefly laid hold of her in happier circum stances, there was brought home to her, for the first time, amid the care which travelled with her, a sense of shivering desolation. It was now no longer impossible for her to conceive that life, young, ardent, and richly gifted, was utterly uncertain. She compre hended that the same God, who was very pitiful and of tender mercy, was also a God who hid himself in clouds and darkness, the dealings of whose providence were a great mystery, and before whose many works man's will and wisdom sank baffled and beaten. The startling novelty, the deepening op pression and terror which were hemming in Ph\u0153be, extended to her maid.

Whether \" them \" stony rocks would never come to an end ? and if they did not give Miss Paston a grue ? Please, she did not want to be troublesome, but was the young nobleman's disease nothing infectious ? Not that she would go back if it were ; she hoped she knew her duty better; but she w7ould like to be told that she might make up her mind. Ph\u0153be would have turned to Barty Wooler to lighten her heart and sustain her spirit, had it not been that, without a shadow of unkindness, he held back from her, not wishing to take advantage of her position, or to push his services farther than they were necessary. The slight tone of sternness which the restraint he put upon himself un consciously lent to his manner, was more than enough to cause Ph\u0153be to shrink into herself. The little bark-covered shed which stood for the station at Strathavie was reached before sunset. The Exmoor carriage, with"], [272, "Noblesse Oblige. 262 the family livery and coat of arms, was in waiting. Ph\u0153be knew the grave, Wellfield face of the man-servant, who knew her and her errand, and who came forward, saying quick ly, as he touched his hat \u2014 \" My lord is neither better nor worse.\" Then he gave his mind to business, and looked for the maid to point out the traps he was to appropriate. Ph\u0153be drew a sigh of relief, though she could not say what she had dreaded. \" Will you not come on with me ?\" and here Ph\u0153be faltered, as Barty Wooler was about to take leave of her, after helping her into the carriage. \" It seems so strange to come so far, and part here. You do not need me to tell you how hospitably Lord Exmoor would have welcomed you any other time, and seen that you had abun dance of sport, which, in ordinary times, is what men think most of in these quarters, I fancy. \" No, thanks.

Don't begin to despair now.

Let me know if you want me ; I shall be at hand, ready.\" And in a moment he was gone, as if his act of mercy was accomplished, and there was nothing more for him to do. The drive between the station and the house took Ph\u0153be through some of the loveliness of wood, water, and rock, which lay within the girdling mountains. The features of the scenery were very striking, both in colour and form. The brown burn leaped, foaming, into the blue loch ; the tangled thicket of mountain-ash, weeping birch, and oak coppice rose majestic on the slopes, relieved by patches of golden oats ; while the olive shoulder of the mountain,"], [274, "264 Noblesse Oblige. where the line of the horizon was beginning to be dved with a blush, swelled in the sun light, and the gray splintered rock broke through the red bloom ; and behind all rose a chain of delicate lilac peaks. There were fragrant, novel scents of bog and myrtle, heather and peat-reek, and a mingled melody of sounds \u2014 bees humming, blackcocks crow ing, sheep bleating, along with the constant trickle and plash of water. Ph\u0153be could not help being a little comforted. She thought God was so good to make so much beauty and delight. He would not break and bruise the hearts of His human creatures, as if His works of nature were around men and women merely to mock and taunt them. She returned to the belief that Lord Wrio- thesley would not die \u2014 not now in his youth and unfulfilled promise, \u2014 forgetting that the sign which was lifted up over the whole bud ding, blossoming world, was that of a man dying, and conquering on a cross.

When she saw Ph\u0153be, who had seen her offer a brave front to every trouble she had met, there was nothing left for her to do but lift up her voice and weep. \" Yes, it is true, Ph\u0153be ; we are to lose the chief of our strength. The great thing Wriothesley is do, is to die in his promise without a stain on his shield. And that is something too ; but God knows it is hard for us to give him up.\" \" Is there no hope ?\" besought Ph\u0153be. \" None, my child ; skill and science, and the wealth of worlds, if we had as much, can do nothing for him. But I am forgetting you, and how tired, as well as sick at heart, vou must be. You must come and rest, and Ml I have something to eat, or \u2014 I was going to say \u2014 Wriothesley will never forgive me.\" Lord Wriothesley's illness hadT seemed nothing out of the common when he was attacked by it ten days before. He had caught a chill, which had been followed by fever, such as he had often suffered from. The attack had been more obstinate than usual ;"], [276, "266 Noblesse Oblige. but there was nothing so extraordinary in it as to excite apprehension. Lord Exmoor did not even send for additional advice to that of the experienced country-doctor who was w7atching the case along with Dr. Mit ford, who was living in the house, till at the crisis, when the bodily forces should have rallied, ominous symptoms suddenly pre sented themselves. The light of a life, which had had but a small supply of the oil of muscular strength to begin with, and had burned high while that oil lasted, was about to leap out with no more than a flicker of warning; and no power on earth could re vive the vital energy, which was so much wasted and worn out as in a man of four score. Lord Wriothesley had not thought him self in danger until he looked on the faces, subdued in their forced cheerfulness, which gathered about his bed ; and when he heard of the medical men being summoned from Edinburgh and London to his aid. \" Then when he asked the doctors their"], [277, "A heavy heart makes a long road. 267 candid opinion, and insisted on having it as his right \" \u2014 so Lady Dorothea told Ph\u0153be \u2014 \" and they told him that he was going, and that any day might end his weakness and weariness, he looked as incredulous as the rest of us, with an expression that seemed to say, ' I will not die. I have my work to do, and I shall live to do it.' I had almost hoped again that he would live and contra dict the medical authorities by sheer force of volition. But after another night's fever and exhaustion, his strength of will did not so much fail, as appear to go over to the other side. He said it was his cross to die thus, and he should get strength to take it up and bear it. He had never thought to shirk his duty. Many a cross had been carried by the men of the line without the right of choice being granted them which would have rendered the crosses no crosses at all. It had been a hard struggle for him to give up his work. Doubtless his share of the common lot was lighter, as it was shorter, than many another man's.

He made no allu sion to his son and Ph\u0153be.

Indeed, save for the absence of the Countess, and the family's dining strictly in private, and dis pensing with the rite of Lady Dorothea and Ph\u0153be dressing for dinner, all social state and form went on unimpaired. These ela borate courses, sparingly eaten of, untouched entremets, the glitter and brightness of plate, glass, flowers, and choice fruits, were simple matters of course, the mere decent decorum of life to two of the party. Even to Ph\u0153be, while they were a wearisome burden, the circumstance of dining for the first time with Lord Exmoor, which would have im pressed her seriously, and been a trial for her to think of a month ago, dwindled into a necessary ceremony. Lord Exmoor plunged into Wellfield gos sip, in order to keep up a semblance of con versation, and to avoid another topic, as if both he and Ph\u0153be had left the town but yesterday. During all the time he spoke, he was listening intently to every sound in the house, making suggestions and comments upon them to Lady Dorothea, and sighing"], [282, "Noblesse Oblige. 272 inadvertently w7oeful sighs.

Ph\u0153be was not frightened, as Lady Ex moor had apprehended. Neither was the white face on the pillows so changed as to distress her. The fine traits were all brought out, and refined, as it were, by the removing of every grosser line in what had never had much grossness. There was more likeness to Lady Dorothea than Ph\u0153be had before re marked in the big forehead and big eyes, but Lady Dorothea, as Ph\u0153be had known her, encumbered with much serving, had not looked so wonderfully calm.

She began to cry, unable to keep back her sobs and tears, vexed and shocked although she was at her weakness. In his kindness Lord Wriothesley took no notice of Ph\u0153be's emotion. With a faint but audible voice, he was thanking her over and over again for coming, and praising her for her goodness. When she had composed herself, he wanted to hear of her journey, and what she thought of Strathavie. Did she not ad mire the Highlands beyond all places she had ever seen \u2014 even Wellfield ?

The next moment he was repeating what he should have shown Ph\u0153be at Strathavie \u2014 the Rock of Lamentation, the Black Spout Waterfall, the Corrie-Nan-Ban ; and then he was calling himself back to inquire for Mrs. Paston, for the Halls, for little Bess.

Lord Wriothesley smiled a little at the implied authority, took her hand, and held it, reluctant to part from her. \" We have seen the day, Ph\u0153be, when I should have shown whether I had not a mind of my own in the matter.\" He told her once more how kind it had been of her to come so far to see him, and how good she was.

His nights were apt to be bad, and \u2014 no one could tell. In the beginning of the night Ph\u0153be was back at his side. At his desire she unfastened"], [288, "Noblesse Oblige. 278 the shutters, pulled up the Venetian blind, and drew aside the curtains for a few minutes, to enable him to see the harvest moonlight on the loch. He began to murmur some lines which had once caught his fancy : \u2014 \" Lay him down, his work is done ; Vain for him is friend or foeman, Rise of moon, or set of sun, Hand of man, or kiss of woman.\" \" You have been my one true love, Ph\u0153be. Though I have not been able to say it to you in so many words before, I think you knew it. Have I been yours ?\" \" You have been very dear to me, Lord Wriothesley,\" replied Ph\u0153be, trembling. \" But have I been the dearest, Ph\u0153be \u2014 dear before every other ?\" \" Great death \" appeared indeed already to look Ph\u0153be through and through, de manding that truth, without which tender ness is worthless. \" I never had a brother, but I do not think I could have had one dearer than you,\" Ph\u0153be said, faintly. \" That answer may serve in the resur-"], [289, "A Beaten Man. 279 rection, where there shall be neither marry ing nor giving in marriage ; but the resurrec tion is not come yet. That answer would not have served me living \u2014 it hardly serves me dying. Have you no other answer for me, Ph\u0153be ?\" There was silence in the room save for the beating of Ph\u0153be's heart, and the labouring of his breath. \" Then you have the answer for an other.\" Still there was only the silence that is assent. It was a great shock to him, even at that hour, \u2014 like a second shivering of life, and what was dearest to him in it. His history had been a blunder. He had spent his best upon a phantom. Had he been saved from it, his life might have been saved too. This was but the seething of passion, soon to settle down. He thought better of him self, of her, and of the ways of God. Was it not rather that the bitterness of death was past for him ? Could anything be lost \u2014 above all, any grain of the love that, in its"], [290, "280 Noblesse Oblige. highest human expression, is a broken re flection of love divine, which he had acknow ledged long ago had helped, under God, to make a man of him ? There was not only justice, there was mag nanimity, too, in the blood of these Exmoors. \" Never mind, Ph\u0153be,\" he spoke again, gently. \" I daresay you loved me as well as you could, a great deal better than I de served. You had not the opportunity right ly to explain yourself, and I was possessed by my dream. Perhaps, if I had been at liberty to give you all, it might have been different ; but I don't know if that ought to have satisfied me, for it would not have been fair dealing to the man who, I suspect, had all along the prior claim. I had a doubt of him at one time. Well, I suppose everything is right, even to his being the conqueror, and I the beaten man.\" \" If he were to know, he would not call you beaten,\" Ph\u0153be vowed solemnly, \" though I have heard him say heaven was for beaten men. He is generous, like you ; but you have conquered both him and me."], [291, "A Beaten Man. 281 Is it not more blessed to give than to re ceive ?

Ph\u0153be remained at Strathavie, and re turned with Lady Dorothea and the Count ess, who followed Lord Exmoor and his melancholy charge to Brockcotes in time for the funeral.

The scythe of the reaper Cuts the ears that are hoary ; But the voice of the weeper Wails manhood in glory.

Lord Wriothesley had a great public funeral, befitting him who had been not only a powerful young nobleman, but one whose early attainments had already attract ed round him other rising men \u2014 thinkers and workers for the mass \u2014 to whom his death was not simply an individual calamity, but something of a general one. The funeral was one of those spectacles which belonged to Wellfield, and was wit nessed by crowds of strangers, who arrived for the purpose. It was a poor and passing compensation for what was a special blow to the town as well as to Lord Exmoor."], [293, "A Beaten Man. 283 When the present Earl died, and the titles and estates passed out of the direct line to the Essex branch of the Latimers, it would be to bring in a race which, though it was fairly creditable to the main stock, and pos sessed at least a share of the traditional vir tues of the house, yet knew not Wellfield. Among the swollen train of noble rela tives, connexions, friends, tenants, and re tainers, there was one carriage, the occu pants of which could afford to be private in the show, and to consider only who had been nearest and dearest to Lord Wriothes ley. The women of the family were not part of the sight. By the shortest, most private road, a carriage carried a company of them within the bounds of the family burial-ground in the park, and set them down close to the mouth of the vault. These cloaked and hooded mourners were the Countess, Lady Dorothea, and Ph\u0153be Paston. Dim records of other Lord Wrio thesleys who had died in their green youth, as heirs-apparent, were floating around among tarnished coffins, broken escutcheons,"], [294, "284 Noblesse Oblige. and half-effaced tablets. More than one of these earlier Lord Wriothesleys had been exceptional men, those whom the gods love ; and looking back on whose brief, fair lives, it seemed most meet that they should have died young, ere the blurred and halt ing fulfilment fell short of the ideal standard they had done their best to raise of what a man, gentleman, and nobleman, ought to be. None could have better put together and related these fragments of the stories of the Lord Wriothesleys and the Middle Ages, of the civil wars, of the trying Georgian era, than Lady Dorothea ; but she let them all slip by her this day. The talk of that car riage was only of Gerard Lord Wriothesley, than whom there had never been a worthier. When dust had been given back to dust, and the carriage on its return wras about to drive up to Brockcotes in the state of its pile, and the magnificence of its au tumn verdure, the cold, stiff little Countess pulled down Ph\u0153be's head for a moment on her poor shoulder, and told her, \"You were his darling ; you must consent to be mine.\""], [295, "A Beaten Man. 285 Before night all Wellfield was apprised of the members of the group. The know ledge afforded foundation for the extrava ganza that Lord Wriothesley had left Ph\u0153be Paston his whole and sole heir, and that he had got Lord Exmoor to swear to adopt her, and make her the same in the family as Lady Dorothea. Ph\u0153be, so said gossip, was to lead a single life the rest of her days, for Lord Wriothesley's sake, sacred to his memory. The young woman who had been so long the town's envy had fallen from her pinnacle, but she had fallen on her feet, and had not lost everything by her fall. Not Well field alone, but Folksbridge, set apart and dedicated Ph\u0153be well-nigh as persistently as ever to the Exmoor family after Lord Wrio thesley's death. It was true that while she could no longer hope to be Countess of Ex moor, she seemed to belong to the Larimers more expressly, whenher connexion with them had been thus owned, though in the very act of its rupture, and when a common sor rowbound them to each other. If Ph\u0153be had cared to know it, she might have found her-"], [296, "Noblesse Oblige. 286 self yet more an object of deep interest, and even of a species of homage, to her cousins the Halls, when she walked abroad in her mourning for her father \u2014 which, in the pub lic eyes, showed also as mourning for Lord Wriothesley \u2014 and when she paid repeated visits to Brockcotes, Swinley Court, and the Exmoors' sea-side quarters, while the family were living in seclusion. She looked to be drifting more entirely out of her class, and into that other which had begun by repudi ating her. Mrs. Paston was exceedingly proud of Ph\u0153be's visits to the Exmoors, and eager to spare her daughter for them, each time they were proposed, reserving her grumbling over her own loneliness till she had gone. On each occasion of Ph\u0153be's return, Mrs. Paston did not fail to wonder and feel aggrieved that Lord Exmoor had not executed some deed of settlement on Ph\u0153be, as in a sense the widow of poor Lord Wriothesley, the word of whom had kept away others. It might be more in reference to what had been Ph\u0153be's relation to Lord Wriothesley"], [297, "A Beaten Man. 287 than poor Mrs. Paston at all comprehended that she brought back with her at last a cur tain of the Countesses's hangings. \" This is all there is left to finish, mamma ; but Lady Exmoor's sight is impaired.

By the time she had ac complished a great centre-piece of tiger lilies, white roses, and love-lies-bleeding, the autumn and the winter of a third year in the lodging in Stephenson Street had given place to a fresh spring. She still put up her nightly piteous prayer \u2014 \" Lord Jesus, wilt Thou not come to set the wrong right, and bring back the lost, as Thou wert wont ?

But Ph\u0153be was even a little reconciled to the untimely snow which had secured her and her mother all day from visitors \u2014 those somewhat constrained, shallow, and idle acquaintances of the upper ranks of Folksbridge into which the Halls had even tually succeeded in introducing them. On the back of Ph\u0153be's finally assuring herself of immunity from company, even"], [301, "The True Elixir. 291 from that of her cousins, and of Mrs. Pas ton's being seized with a formidable fit of yawning, a carriage drove up to the door. A double knock was heard ; and while Mrs. Paston was balancing her cap, and Ph\u0153be was insisting that there must be a mistake, Lady Dorothea was shown in. Her ladyship had not been in Folks bridge since the Pastons came to it, and Ph\u0153be had received no intimation of this visit. The Exmoors had begun to go into the world again, and Ph\u0153be had seen and heard less of them lately. The last she had heard was that the family were to be in town during the season, for the first time since Lady Dorothea's marriage had been arranged with Mr. Blount when he was called Lord Fairchester. Breaking in upon Ph\u0153be in the drawing room in Stephenson Street, when the in clement afternoon was drawing to an in clement night, Ph\u0153be's impression was that some extraordinary event was in the wind ; and then, as the fire-light flickered up from the black dress which Lady Dorothea still u 2"], [302, "292 Noblesse Oblige. wore, to her little white face, Ph\u0153be's heart sank in thinking what that something might be. Lady Dorothea, with her old quickness, speedily read the look. \" No, Ph\u0153be, I am not going to die yet, \u2014 not in that sense, though I was very near it a month ago ; but I am going to be mar ried to-morrow, and I am come myself to carry you away with me to Phantasy, to stay with me there till it is all over. You need not see any of the Essex Larimers, who are at Phantasy just now, unless you like ; but you must come with me.\" \" Yes, I will go with you anywhere,\" pro mised Ph\u0153be, but with the most urgent look of inquiry. \" Of course,\" said Lady Dorothea, antici pating the question Ph\u0153be insisted on put ting, \" the bridegroom is Mr. Blount, who has come across from Canada to make a settlement with his cousin, in which his sis ters are concerned.

Is it not very good of them, when mamma has to make such an effort? \u2014 and there is no doubt the marriage is a great trial to them, though you may be sure, also, I have their consent, otherwise I should not take the step.\" Ph\u0153be asked no questions then, but left her mother to offer the puzzled malapropos congratulations, which were brought to a sudden stop by Lady Dorothea's candid, naive confession. \" Oh, dear, no ! I am getting no fine things this time, Mrs. Paston. Don't you know, I am leaving all my fine things be hind me ? Of what use could they possibly be to a farmer's wife in Canada ?\" It was sufficient occupation for Ph\u0153be, during the half-hour Lady Dorothea waited for her, to equip herself for her expedition, and find a dress not altogether out of keep ing with a wedding. It was like another dream to Ph\u0153be that Lady Dorothea was going to be married in"], [304, "Noblesse Oblige. 294 this offhand fashion ; and, after all, to Mr. Blount, a colonist, working on borrowed money, with the slur of the bar-sinister on his shield. Ph\u0153be could not quickly take in the marriage as the end of Lady Dorothea's rank, beauty, and talent, \u2014 as the end of her duty to her parents, and her devotion to her house. The end was as difficult a problem as that of Lord Wriothesley's death. Look ing at the transparent hand, waxed languid, and falling wearily in the middle of the cha racteristic gesture, \u2014 at the face, so wan and shadowy in its outline, that its nobility seem ed to mock its want of substance, Ph\u0153be would have discovered no marvel in the an guish of the decree that Lady Dorothea was fast to follow her brother, and the Earl and the Countess to be written childless in their great possessions. But Ph\u0153be was not prepared to compass the question of an unequal marriage \u2014 un equal according to Lady Dorothea's stan dard, which must have been contracted at last, on a few weeks' warning. Lady Dorothea was too wearied to enter"], [305, "The True Elixir. 295 on explanations on the road to Phantasy. She had driven to Stephenson Street, leav- ing the carriage with her maid in the rum- ble at the Pastons' door. She was on her way from the station where the Essex Lari- mers had met her, and whence they had gone on before, at her request, to Phantasy. She was just recovered from a severe ill- ness, of which Ph\u0153be had got no intimation. Lady Dorothea was keeping herself up for the fatigue of the next day, and of the jour- ney, till, as she trusted, the voyage should re- cruit her; for Mr. Blount could neither afford to remain in this country absent from the bringing in of his lots of land and the reap- ing of their virgin crops, nor could he come back for her in less than a year. But Lady Dorothea told Ph\u0153be that once they had arrived and got a cup of tea, she w7ould be able to chat to Ph\u0153be, and tell her every- thing. It was quite true, so far, that Lady Dorothea could close her eyes, keep still, and take the rest that was necessary for her, until she opened her eyes again, sat up re freshed, and announced with animation, which"], [306, "Noblesse Oblige. 296 was in itself charming, that she felt a vast deal better already, and able for any amount of gossip \u2014 her hardest work at present. Lady Dorothea decided that she must exert herself, and go down and dine with the family, and that Ph\u0153be had better show herself under her wing. \" They are com mon-place, goodish sort of people, and per fectly harmless, these Essex Larimers. They will stare a little at you, but I shall divide their attention. They think me maddish, you know, as they thought dear Wriothes ley. But I must say, considering that we have not had very much connection with them before, except in showing them a little cousinly civility, they have been very friendly in lending us their house and their counten ance just now. There is no self-seeking in their good-nature, because they are aware papa can no more alienate the title and the estates from them than he can reinstate John Blount Marquis of Fairchester.

Mrs. Latimer had the honesty to tell me that she could not approve of my marriage. How could she, with five daugh ters, in addition to her three sons, to be the Ladies Latimer after me ? But with papa and mamma's giving their consent, there was no call for her to object. So the Essex Larimers have been kind and considerate in proposing to have the ceremony here, sufficiently out of the way, yet in a relative's house.\" Lady Dorothea spoke always of her mar riage as an act to be done in a corner, and yet she never alluded to Mr. Blount without a glistening of her clear eyes, and a sweet sus picion of colour coming into her pale cheek. Ph\u0153be was in no perturbation at facing the common-place, harmless Larimers. She"], [308, "Noblesse Oblige. 298 had come to stand such fire. Lady Doro thea looked at her in approbation. \" You have got the one thing you wanted, Ph\u0153be \u2014 unconsciousness,which is nine-tenths of ease and breeding.\" \" I am glad I have got anything I wanted, and am the better of,\" Ph\u0153be answered. \" I am only afraid it has been a little dearly bought,\" she finished, with a sigh. There were only Mr. and Mrs. Latimer and three of their daughters at Phantasy. There was no company staying in the house beyond Lady Dorothea and her friend \u2014 not even Mr. Blount, who was not to come down till before church-time the next day. The members of the family were quite well-dis posed and well-behaved, though conventional and slow \u2014 down to the large, handsome young ladies. The natural tendency was in creased by the household's not having yet got over the exultation aroused in them by the opening up to them of the great succes sion to the Exmoor titles and estates on the death of Lord Wriothesley. At the same time, the Essex Larimers had a decent per-"], [309, "The True Elixir. 299 ception that they ought to express their exul tation in a subdued and becoming manner, not inconsistent with the mourning and the condolence due from them on the grievous bereavement suffered by the head of the house, and on the premature removal of the coming man, whom they and the rest of his kinsmen had been training themselves to re gard as their future hero. Withal the Essex Latimers laid their heads together, and declared to each other secretly that there had turned out something eccentric and un accountable, both in Lord Wriothesley and in Lady Dorothea, which must have been deeply distressing to poor Lord and Lady Exmoor, and which really seemed to indi cate that the main line of the Latimers, like that of the Bourbons or the Stuarts, ought to come to an end. There was the universal belief that Lord Wriothesley, had he lived, would have accomplished a miser able mesalliance with this same girl \u2014 a lady like, modest young woman of her class, but of a class infinitely below that of any tutor's daughter. Ladv Dorothea would retain O m/"], [310, "300 Noblesse Oblige. Miss Paston as her companion and friend, whom the Essex Latimers were under the necessity of entertaining. And to think of Lady Dorothea's marrying Mr. Blount after all ! No wonder she continued to preserve the recollection of what had been her poor brother's infatuation, by her own unbroken intimacy with Miss Paston. Certainly, Miss Paston might not improperly associate with a Canadian backwoodsman's wife, and assist at her wedding, when Mrs. Latimer enter tained a serious scruple against allowing Helena, or Adela, or her own young Doro thea, to serve as bridesmaids to their cousin, in case the names with the particulars should get into the papers. The whole thing was such a dangerous precedent. It was a marvel that the Earl and the Countess could have been brought to consent to it. They had done nothing to compromise themselves, un less in demonstrating that they could not have brought up their son and daughter very well ; and that there must have been some fundamental flaw in their training. The Latimers' stares were all within the"], [311, "The True Elixir. 301 bounds of conventionality and courtesy, and, as Lady Dorothea had promised, she divided them fully. Poor Lord Wriothesley's imprudent flame was an interest of the past to the most sentimental of the young ladies, compared to the immediate sensation ex cited by their cousin Dorothea, coming down among them to huddle over a marriage, which was to have no glorious attendant cir cumstance, not so much as a carriage of her own to drive away in from the church door. The following day was to see this sad ex change ; yet there sat Lady Dorothea, de frauded of the simple distinction, the family petting which was the right of every bride, because nobody liked to speak of this mar riage and its accompaniments beforehand ; and the Earl, and the Countess, and the bridegroom himself, were not to arrive till the last moment. In spite of everything, had it not been for her wretched health, Lady Dorothea looked as sure of her own mind, and as satisfied as if Mr. Blount were still Marquis of Fairchester, and Lord of Sans Pareil and Ford-in-the-Marsh."], [312, "302 Noblesse Oblige. There was one good in Lady Dorothea's recent illness, that it afforded her a pretext for retiring early to her own room. No sooner was she in her dressing-gown, than she sent to Ph\u0153be, whom she had taken care to have established in the room next to hers. Lady Dorothea begged Ph\u0153be to per mit the door of communication between the rooms to be opened, and to come in and sit with her till it was a christian hour to go to sleep. She dismissed her maid \u2014 no longer Thorpie. As Lady Dorothea had told Ph\u0153be, Thorpie, with many expressions of regret, and with much to suffer from the righteous reprobation of her aunt, Miss Thorpe, had given in her leave from the hour Lady Doro thea's marriage was announced. \" I don't deny Thorpie's instant secession was mortifying, but it was so far good,\" de clared Lady Dorothea. \"I cannot afford any but the plainest sewing-maid in my new condition ; and, as I have told you often, Thorpie was a terrible handful in a strange place.\" \" Now we shall have it out, Ph\u0153be,\" Lady Dorothea proposed, when Ph\u0153be was"], [313, "The True Elixir. 303 seated close to her in the cosiness of Lady Dorothea's room. \" The evening is my best time still.

At last she has left her husband, and gone off with a nephew of the very man who dragged down her mother to destruction. There is a horrible fate attending that family. I don't mean to say that Chetwynd could not have resisted it ; but think of where and what she is, and where and what Wriothesley is now ? Not but that he may be more pitiful of the miserable woman than we are \u2014 ' With larger, other eyes than ours, To make allowance for us all.' But for me, I would have said I should as soon have laid down my womanliness as my privileges of birth ; and it was the womanli ness that did it. I never meant it.

But it would not do,\" continued Lady Dorothea, shaking her head. \" I think I took too much out of myself, as Wriothesley wouldn't be persuaded not to do.

You must not imagine that the Earl and the Countess gave him the least encouragement ; they were as much shocked and affronted as I was. But we began to meet him everywhere, and you know he was always incorrigible, he would take no re pulse.

I could not tell whether I should be permitted to go to him and help him as a disembodied spirit, though I hoped so with all my heart; and while I was still in the body, it would be such a comfort to meet him and hear his honest, kindly voice again. As I was to die in a month or two at the latest, the indul gence could not signify, would not harm anybody much. You cannot think how sorry he w7as for me, and how he was dis tracted \u2014 he who was so staid \u2014 between his sorrow and his gladness to be with me once more.

It was celebrated on a bluster ing March morning, in the little parish church nearest Phantasy. Nobody was present beyond a few of the relations and Ph\u0153be Paston. The most of the company were still in mourning. The bride herself was neither in Honiton nor in Brussels lace, but in the plainest of white silks. The very season seemed to be against a wedding : it did not admit of many flowers, and the whole marriage-party were shivering with"], [326, "Noblesse Oblige. 316 cold, if not with agitation. Only the bells in the towef up in the air sent forth an un mistakable sign of rejoicing. Lady Exmoor walked into church, but was forced to sit throughout the service. Lord Exmoor brought in his daughter, in a violent hurry, as if he were afraid lest he should repent and forbid the ceremony at the last moment. Then he took up his position, keeping guard over his wife, and looking sterner than he had ever looked before, in his thin-haired, long-legged dignity. He was struggling against his sense of incongruity and impro priety \u2014 attributes which he had been born and bred to detest \u2014 and gulping down deeper and more cruel feelings of being stripped of a daughter as well as of a son, and of giving up the comfort of his own and his wife's old age \u2014 the light and charm of their life. And all this that Lady Doro thea might go to America with a nameless man, whose horrid ill-luck at home had been a by-word, if not a reproach ; and, for what Lord Exmoor could tell, might be forc ed to share with him a log-house or a shanty."], [327, "Throwing herself away. 317 There had been no choice for Lord Exmoor but either to sanction the sacrifice, or to lay Lady Dorothea beside Lord Wriothesley in the family vault. Some earls, particular ly the earls of plays and novels, might have preferred the last alternative ; but Lord Exmoor agreed with his daughter in putting the man and father before the nobleman, when it came to an extremity. The great anxiety was that the ceremony and the leave-taking should be got over as quickly as possible, that they might be ren dered less of a strain on the strength and for titude of Lady Dorothea and the Countess. Both were firm. Noblesse forbade noisy hysterics, and shrank from a coarse laying bare of the heart ; but it was with an agony and a life-time of love in a long, last look, that Lady Dorothea passed from her father and mother, and went away with Mr. Blount.

And Mr. Blount was young and manly certainly, not without inherent nobility in his adversity \u2014 without doubt something of a hero to others as well as to Lady Dorothea. Nor was he by any means so ill-looking as to qualify fatally the beauty of his bride. There was one relative present at Lady Dorothea's marriage, who, like Lord and Lady Exmoor and Mr. Blount, arrived on the wedding morning, but unlike them, un expectedly and without receiving a cordial reception from the owners of Phantasy.

But although Ph\u0153be continued to visit Lady Exmoor occasionally, and although she was assured by many a kind remem brance that her ladyship did not forget her, and that it was not by mere forms of words that the Countess, in the letters which she still contrived with her crippled fingers to write to her, addressed her as \"Dear Ph\u0153be,\" and signed herself \" Your true friend, Anne Exmoor ;\" and although there came to Ste phenson Street \" no end of game and fruit,\" as the Halls reported, there was not the smallest ground for the supposition that Ph\u0153be was to be transplanted to Brockcotes or Piccadilly.

But their niece, who had been buxom Judith Clay when they were middle-aged men, on coming to spend a few days with her son in his rooms above the great shop, was smitten by a stroke of the disease of which she had felt long before had an incipient touch, and was deprived in a great measure of the power of motion, being reduced for the rest of her days to an invalid's chair. After the first few weeks there did not seem to be much more danger to her life than there was to that of the strong man her son. Her mental faculties were unimpaired, her speech was preserved. With Barty by her side, and the memory of an honest life to ponder upon, Mrs. Wooler announced that she could bear her captivity. \" It is not worse than the county prison, Barty ; and it is without the bread and the water and the disgrace,\" she said, with a gleam of her old humour. \" What should I be sallying abroad in search of at my years, that I should care to be a gad-about ?

She earned the respect as well as the regard of those who waited upon her.

She never wanted feet and hands, and eyes and ears, for that matter, with the best, when her son was with her. But while she set loving and jealous store on his services, she hated to detain him, and occupy his valuable time with her silly re quirements when he might be so much bet ter occupied among his ledgers, his people, or his brushes and paints. She would have him become a great merchant, and a great painter yet, just to show the world what was in him. She would have him do more than any other man for his Master and his fellows, to make up for his long dalliance. Her ambition for her son had not yet come to an end. Deprived of her old occupation as vigilant watcher over the public morals, and as vigorous administrator of justice on her own account, Mrs. Wooler was reduced to the consideration that a daughter-in-law might be an acceptable addition to the household.

It would be an advantage to Becky too ; for Becky was likely to be lost without a mistress's active superintendence. Mrs. Wooler got the length of wiling away her large amount of leisure by con ning projects for her son's establishment as a result of her sedentary matchmaking.

She was troubled rather at the thought of what Mrs. Wooler could possibly wish to say to her.

She had been within these walls since then, but the neighbourhood recalled fresh ly to her mind the events of two years back. Barty Wooler's bachelor rooms, with their artist's sketches and relics of travel, had their temporary, tent-like character very much modified by the figure of the old woman, a fixture in her chair set by the window, and by the elaborate provision for her comfort which had been established around. The old yeoman ruddiness of colour, and that erectness of carriage which often com petes successfully with the slouching round ness of shoulders \u2014 a result found in genera tions who have guided the plough in the furrow \u2014 still distinguished Mrs. Wooler. She sat in her starched lace cap, silk shawl, and mittens, waiting for her visitor. Ph\u0153be's reluctance yielded at the sight of the old woman. She remembered how the feet, motionless now, had moved about her"], [341, "Mrs. Wooler s Ambition. 331 father's bed, and how the wide-open eyes had winked away bright tears of sympathy for the girl-w7oman in her cruel strait. Ph\u0153be went up with some alacrity, and clasped the nerveless hand, in whose power and craft Mrs. Wooler had once had her pride. She received Ph\u0153be graciously, and was sometime in coming to the point of explaining why she had sent for her. The old woman was so ready to talk of the weather and of trade, of Ph\u0153be's mother, and the Messrs.

This covert fid getting, which Mrs. Wooler was still acute enough to detect, roused the old woman's ire. \" You may rest and keep yourself cool in this summer weather, Miss Paston,\" said Mrs. Wooler, with a gleam in her eyes ; \" you won't be put about by Barty intruding upon us.

She was not without generosity that she should not repent of a wanton injury, though she was more of a just than a generous woman. Ph\u0153be had hid her face in her hands. At that moment a footstep was heard in the next room. Mrs. Wooler, who had already been baulked of the effect she had sought to produce, betrayed some trepida tion, stoutly as her old heart beat against what was no better than the bars of a cage. \" Dontee ! dontee !\" she conjured Ph\u0153be, lapsing into her purest vernacular. \" It is Barty come back, and he'll think I've been as good as beating you.\""], [353, "Forty-six and Tiventy-six. 343 It was Barty, who had either returned by accident, or had found some reason to sus pect that his mother was stealing a march upon him. He had not exactly expected to find Ph\u0153be with his mother, for he stopped for an instant before he came forward with a quick, gratified gait to greet her. Ph\u0153be had made a violent effort to meet his mother's wishes in one respect, to the extent of trying to banish all traces of agitation from her face. But the signs were plain to a man in whom suspicion was roused. He broke off before he had asked her how she did, and addressed his mother shortly and sharply instead, looking from Ph\u0153be to her and back again. \" What is this ? What have you been saying or doing to Miss Paston, mother?\" \" Nothing, son Barty,\" answered Mrs. Wooler, aspiring to smooth him down, but doing it the wrong way; \"nothing, save what she as well as you may thank me for \u2014 even bidding her be friends with you, lad, and make everything up while she has it in her power.\""], [354, "Noblesse Oblige. 344 \" There is nothing to make up,\" protested Barty, hotly, \" and I will not have anyone meddle.\" \" No, it is not to be thought of,\" rejoined Mrs. Wooler, \" not even in your mummy of an old mother, who was only seeking to serve her ungrateful flesh and blood, by spending her breath \u2014 all that she has to spend \u2014 and shaking up her poor wits, to convince Ph\u0153be Paston that her father's daughter should dole to vou a share of the kindness which she has mJ lavished on the quality.

Barty made a gesture of despair. \" Why will you say such things, mother? It is you who are unkind. Better come Avith me, Miss Paston, and let me show you what I am doing ; that will, at least, be a more agreeable study.\" Ph\u0153be was glad to go with him ; awk-"], [355, "Forty-six and Twenty-six. 345 ward as it was, it was less awkward than to stay. Mrs. Wooler bade Ph\u0153be a good-bye, in which huffiness was oddly tinged with triumph, as of one who had long promised herself to take an extreme and vehemently opposed step, and who had taken it, what ever might be the consequences. When Ph\u0153be and Barty were out together in the great wareroom, it seemed Barty was doing nothing, or that he had forgotten what he was doing, for Ph\u0153be looked round with dazzled eyes in vain for the work they were to look at. Instead of it there had been a flood-gate opened in Barty's nature which would not shut again. In the face of his indignation with his old mother, he set his back to the wall, and echoed her reproach with bitterness of his own. \" Ph\u0153be, it is so far true what she said.

There is, to our thinking, more pernicious doctrine in one chap ter of some of the sensational novels which find admirers in drawing-rooms and eulogists in the press than in the whole of Mr. Dixon's interesting work.\" \u2014 Examiner. \" No more wondrou3 narrative of human passion and romance, no stranger con tribution to the literature of psychology than Mr. Dixon's book has been published since man first began to seek after the laws that govern the moral and intellectual life of the human race. To those readers who seek in current literature the plea sures of intellectual excitement we commend it as a work that affords more enter tainment than can be extracted from a score of romances. But its power to amuse is less noteworthy than its instructiveness on matters of highest moment. ' Spiritual Wives' will be Btudied with no less profit than interest.\" \u2014 Morning Post. \" The subject of ' Spiritual Wives' iB full of deep interest. If we look at it simply as a system, it is replete with scenes which cannot be surpassed even in fiction, .Regarded from a social point of view, it appears a gigantic evil, and threatens society with disintegration. Examined carefully, as a phenomenon of religious life, for as such it must be considered, it presents features of great psychological signi ficance, and will be found to illustrate some important truths. Mr. Hepworth Dixon's book will be found an interesting exposition of the whole subject of ' Spi ritual Wives.' He has obtained his information from the best sources, sought and secured interviews with the chiefs of the movement, and the inner circle of their supporters at home and abroad. The facts have been most carefully collected, and are collated with great skill and care. Bnt what strikes us most forcibly is the power and reticence with which the difficult and delicate topic is discussed in all its bearings. The object which the author proposed to himself at the outset was to write a chapter for the history necessary to illustrate the spiritual passions of man. And this intention has been fulfilled with unusual ability. The style of tho work is charming. Some of the sketches of character are traced with the highest artistic BkilL The scenes introduced into the narrative are full of life and glowing with colour. In short, there is nothing to desire as regards the manner in which Mr. Dixon has treated his subject. Regarded from a literary point of view, the work is eminently successful.\" \u2014 Globe.

It is published under the especial patronage of Her Majesty, and is annually corrected throughout, from the personal com munications of the Nobility.

Independently of its full and authentic informa tion respecting the existing Peers and Baronets of the realm, the most sedulous attention is given in its pages to the collateral branches of the various noble families, and the names of many thousand individuals are introduced, which do not appear in other records of the titled classes.
