When James Greystone, the English surgeon, passed under the porte cochere of No. 6, Eue des Feuillandines, and called out to the house porter in his smoky den that he was going up to Mr. Bertall's on the fifth floor, he was, to all appearances, the most confirmed bachelor in the whole of Paris. Not that he was of an age to renounce matrimony, for he was barely thirty two ; not that he would have been an ineligible suitor, for he was a handsome man and a success ful one in his profession ; but because he had made that profession his idol, because at that shrine he had laid down his whole existence, and never even contemplated the possibility of giving his jealous mistress \u2014 science \u2014 a rival in the shape of woman. Yet for all that, when Dr. Greystone"], [14, "10 Doctor Greystone, stepped out again into the wet, shiny, lamp-lit streets of the noisy Quartier des Ecoles he was Grace Bertall's affianced husband, James Greystone was the only son of a widow. His mother had been content to spend the re mainder of her days in the remote Shropshire village to which she had come as a youthful bride. Her husband, a simple country practi tioner, was a gentleman in the higher and truer sense of the word, recognised as such by the county families and landed gentry around Cal thorpe, and a welcome guest at their table. Mrs. Greystone, ever calmly satisfied with her lot, had borne her bereavement when it came \u2014 all too early in her married life \u2014 with brave resignation, and henceforth asked of the future no further solace than the listening from afar to the voice of fame beginning to echo the name of her son. She belonged to that long race of patient, silent women, wives and mothers, who know of happi ness only the pale joys of abnegation and sacrifice ; unambitious, self-forgetting helpmeets of clever, aspiring men, to whose wants and comforts they minister, receiving little attention and less gratitude, claiming neither, and accepting with seeming cheerfulness the solitude to which they are condemned when excitement, pleasure, or glory call their loved ones away. Mr. Grey stone had been an average husband ; James, \u2022albeit reserved and undemonstrative, was a kind"], [15, "A Patient Finds the Doctor, 11 and dutiful son. None, perhaps, stood in his estimation higher than his gentle, quiet mother, and when he left Calthorpe for school, and later for London, his letters, though irregular and hurried, were warmer and less reticent than his speech. Mrs. Greystone trusted him implicitly ; her faith in his rectitude, singleness of purpose, and honour was unbounded ; she had never sought to assert her authority or exercise any control over his actions ; instinct more than ex perience taught her that as long as his full confi dence was not withheld, his affection was un impaired. The young man had successfully fought his way to the foremost ranks ; he had, almost without protection, obtained a fair practice in London, and had been offered at no distant period the reversion of the post of house surgeon in one of the great hospitals, a flattering and enviable recognition of his worth. Yet he had renounced the security and advantages of his position in the pursuit of the \u2014 to him \u2014 most attractive branch of his studies. He was one of the warmest advocates of vivisection ; he maintained that none who called themselves healers of men could success fully wage their battle against the insidious foes of chronic ailment or hereditary taint unless they grappled with the active, living, palpitating form of each. He argued that victorious disease had spent itg strength on its dead victims \u2014 he wanted"], [16, "Doctor Greystone. 12 to meet the enemy in full possession of all its resources, so as to conquer him before he had achieved its fell purpose ; he deemed the sacrifice of a score of breathing dumb animals neither useless nor even cruel if it afforded the man of science an opportunity of snatching secrets which would eventually benefit the human race. Paris, with its wide field and resources, its generous hospitality to the adepts in all arts, sciences, and discoveries, its open-handed en couragement of progress, attracted him irresis tibly. He had been for a long time familiar with the admirable works of Bernard and Robin ; he* had learnt from Laurent and Lemaitre ; he had perused the exhaustive pamphlets on the contro verted subjects ; a gradually increasing corre spondence with the most eminent specialists of France, and a perfect mastery of the language con spired to strengthen a resolve he had formed of spending a couple of years in the French capital in order to prosecute his researches and fortify his convictions. The home appointment was not actually vacant yet ; Mrs. Greystone offered no demur ; it was not her wont to oppose her son in wish or whim of his, whatever the pain might be to her mother's heart ; so it promptly came to pass that the London patients were handed over to a fellow-surgeon, and Doctor Greystone found himself settled in a small, fairly comfort able lodging in one of the infinitely subdivided"], [17, "A Patient Finds the Doctor. 13 tall houses with which the sixth Arrondissement abounds. The Rue du Cherche Midi is con veniently situated between the Academy of Medicine and the Sorbonne, and for the enthusi astic English student Paris possessed no other objects of interest. He did not care to make new acquaintances, and only sought out his former correspondents, men as earnest as himself, by whom he was promptly adopted as one of the brotherhood. His days were spent at hospitals, amphitheatres, lectures, and libraries ; his solitary evenings in putting into shape his voluminous notes and extracts. Among the medical students who followed the lectures , or Cours, as they were called, of the world-famed Dr. C , (the old surgeon for whom James Greystone entertained a special reverence), was a young man, with an eager, sharp, intelli gent face, the restless expression of which con trasted at times with one of extreme good nature. His name was Laurent Noel, his atten dance irregular, and Greystone had never as yet had the opportunity of exchanging with him any of the ordinary civilities which the promiscuity of the lecture room facilitates. Spite of his habitual absorption, he was interested in the young fellow, perhaps because he was physiologically curious about the contrasting revelations of character betrayed in his countenance. One evening in early spring, as the Doctor was"], [18, "14 Doctor Greystone. strolling under the blossoming chestnuts of the Luxembourg Gardens, Laurent Noel, who had crossed his path several times looking at him intently, suddenly stopped before him, raised his cap, and in fairly correct English, but with a strong foreign accent, addressed him \u2014 \u25a0 \" Thousand excuses, Monsieur Greystone \u2014 pardon my indiscretion \u2014 one of your compatriots who lives in the Rue des Feuillandines has been taken with a sort of fit \u2014 not the first.

I bet you he knows most Continental towns \u2014 and to his cost, Spa, Homburg, Monaco\u2014 but, bah,\" he added with an expressive shrug of his shoulder and the easy philosophy of a Bohemian, \" what will you? One must pull the devil by the tail, sometimes.\" \" It may be Tom Bertall after all,\" said the Doctor almost to himself. Then in a brisk busi ness voice he pursued \u2014 \" Come, let us hurry, I have an hour to spare,\" and the two men has tened through the maze of narrow, tortuous streets lying between the stately old Luxembourg slumbering in its abandonment, and the busy centre of intellectual progress and activity. CHAPTER II. HOW TOM BERTALL SHIFTED HIS RESPONSIBILITIES. It was Tom Bertall, and yet Laurent Noel had spoken the truth ; he had for years drifted on that troubled stream of European cities which carries on to final destruction the bankrupts, sharpers, gamblers, and swindlers of all nationali ties, and here and there floats amidst its treacher ous shoals semi-genteel poverty and impecunious impotency struggling to retain before the world \u2014 or a portion of a certain world \u2014 some last shreds of decency and respectability. No heinous offence had as yet had been laid to Bertall's door ; none"], [20, "16 Doctor Greystone. of those misdemeanours which would have placed him in the grasp of the law and defi nitely rid his family of any anxiety respecting him ; but youthful recklessness had degener ated into doubtful middle-aged shadiness, and by facile degrees he had descended to all but the lowest rungs of the social ladder. His old Woolwich chums, the fellow officers in the crack regiment he had been advised to leave after some glaring act of folly, the pleasant acquaintances of his earlier wanderings abroad, the few staunch friends who had clung to him through the deep ening shadows, had all been discouraged in turn by the utter hopelessness of his erring ways, and seceded from their allegiance to the irreclaimable scapegrace. Entirely unconscious as he habitually seemed of this ostracism, there were hours now and then when he measured the progress of his downward course and looked up with startled wonder at those higher and purer spheres where his place had been marked by birth, education, intelligence, and physical advantages, and which knew him no more. Tom Bertall had married young and unwisely, as such men always do, and had lost his wife opportunely when it appeared impossible that he could support her any longer. Careless ne'er do-wells trust to chance with a blind confidence justified by precedent, and shift their responsi bilities with easy insouciance on suppositions"], [21, "How Tom Bertall Shifted his Responsibilities. 17 eventualities. His confidence was justified. Some one came forward and paid the expenses of the funeral ; some one else took charge charge of the baby daughter, and thus probably saved her life ; later on the child was found in clothes and the rudiments of education in the same haphazard, desultory fashion ; and at one time a tender-hearted, motherly hausfrau allowed the growing girl to remain in her boarding house even after a continuous run of ill luck had driven her gambling father from Baden-Baden in such a hurry that he neglected to pay his debts. Sir Frederick Bertall, the head of the family, uncle and godfather of the child, unwilling for the credit of his name that she should remain a pensioner on the good woman's charity, paid off the score and settled on her a small annuity a year or two before his death. About this time Tom Bertall again emerged from obscurity. He had been persuaded by some easy-going, foolish, but on the whole comparatively harmless new friends, to pitch his erratic tent in Paris and to in- vest a rare windfall at cards in the unusual repu- tability of an apartment very near the sky, second- hand furniture, and a small maid of all work, in preference to the doubtful hospitalities of the garni ox hotel mcuble. Gay, fascinating, unscrupulous, unquestioning Paris suited the elderly nomad ; a chronic inability to discharge outstanding bills held him fast, and he seemed so entirely to have B"], [22, "Doctor Greystone. 18 renounced his roving habits that he suddenly remembered his daughter, her annuity, and his paternal duties, and summoned her to his side. Grace was then twenty, with no beauty of face or form save that of youth and a fair creamy complexion, which seemed to set off the excessive softness and placidity of her appearance. This was in its turn the index to a nature all pliability and nervelessness ; no vicissitude of fortune affected her serenity, for she had neither the energy that breasts adversity, the pride that rebels at humiliation, or the delicacy that shrinks from help proffered. Her moral sense, if she had ever possessed one, was blunted now, her intellect was undeveloped, her mind untrained, but she had a clinging, superficial, universal lovingness and tenderness which appealed irresis tibly to the other sex, spite the versatility with which it was transferred. Her facile tears were as easily dried as her smiles were won ; her temper was good, which was the more to her credit that her health was bad and that she owed the ivory delicacy of her skin to a latent weakness of the heart, which in early childhood had nearly proved fatal. Grace Bertall had one strength only, the strength of helplessness and weakness ; it called forth the chivalry of men, while the innate, uncon scious feminine instincts of tyranny taught her how best to use her power. Tom Bertall soon found out that this first"], [23, "How Tom Bertall Shifted his Responsibilities. 19 demonstration of fatherly affection had been a profitable one. From the day of his daughter's reintegration at his hearthstone his lines seem to drop into pleasanter places. Landlords were less sternly exacting on quarter day ; creditors were amenable to persuasion, and retired with small in stalments of a long-standing debt ; tradespeople no longer sent in stale or damaged goods or treated his representations with contemptuous apologies; habitues brought to the dingy parlour of No. G, of the Rue de Feuillandines, fruit, books, theatre cou pons, and, when the girl girl looked more than usually pale and complained of weariness, they contrived for her, out of their scanty means, pleasant outings to Fontainebleau, Versailles, or St. Germain, and bright afternoon excursions to the less distant but equally charming environs of Paris, the suburbs with the picturesque or his torical names Auteuil, Fontenay-aux-Roses, Vin cennes, Enghien. A dainty little repast under a green arbour, a row on river or lake, an hour at a cafe chantant were among the recreations of the day. Grace was never known to refuse those treats, and would return at night on the arm of one or other of her father's friends, equally grateful to each, equally ready to accept pleasure from another. No anxiety as to opinion, no servile submission to the unwritten code of Mrs. Grundy fettered Tom Bertall or his daughter ; the easy freedom and unconventionality of their"], [24, "20 Doctor Greystone. Bohemian life ignored rather than it defied criticism. Laurent Noel, living in the same house, had been a frequent visitor at Mr. Bertall's during his bachelor days, and became still more assiduous after Grace's advent. He, like the others, carried on a half playful, half tender flirtation with the young girl. She probably cared for him a little more than for the others, but at all events she led him to believe that it was a great deal, and felt neither timidity or shyness in so doing. Her evident partiality, conveyed to him by the thousand arts in which women are adepts, touched and flattered the real tenderness under lying the professed scepticism and callousness acquired at some trouble by the young man, who considered it his duty to remain in unison with the tone adopted by his fellow medical students. Had Laurent Noel not been dependent on a somewhat strict father living in a remote Depart ment for his paltry income, unaided as yet by the fruit of his labour, he would at once have made the English girl his wife. Necessity alone sealed his lips, but as the implied if unexpressed intention became more evident even to Grace's somewhat dull perceptions, she allowed the love passages between them to grow warmer and warmer, and for a time at least both the young people were convinced of their mutual attachment. At this juncture Tom Bertall's splendid consti-"], [25, "How Tom Bertall Shifted his Responsibilities. ' 21 tution broke down suddenly ; alarming syncopes resembling paralytic seizures warned him that the physical powers on which he had drawn so long and so recklessly were failing him at last, as all his other resources had done before. Bankrupt in all that makes decliniHg years endurable, ruined, disowned, invalided, the voluntary exile from home and country unaccountably conceived an unreason ing longing for the associations he had severed. He turned impatiently from the ill-timed and boisterous companionship of his associates and hangers-on in his sick craving for a familiar English face, a cheery English voice. The name of James Greystone, casually pronounced one day by Laurent Noel, struck him, and awoke a dim recollection of having once met the then rising young doctor during a fleeting visit to England, many years ago, when he was still at intervals a tolerated guest in the old Shropshire family house. With the querulous persistence of illness he craved for further particulars about the English surgeon, and at last prevailed upon the young man to bring him to his bedside. Doctor Greystone, to whom the whole flavour and atmosphere of the Bertall establishment were constitutionally distasteful, did not, how ever, after the first two or three visits, feel justi fied in refusing his disinterested professional attendance to the stricken man, whose surround ings plainly told a tale of shiftless penury, and on"], [26, "22 Doctor Greystone. whose drawn and haggard features the stamp of death was already affixed. Tom Bertall clung to his new-found friend with almost senile despair ; he became, as it were, dependent on him for advice, encouragement, and support ; in that strange but frequent return to early habits and feelings which precedes dissolution, the company and presence of the loud, unrefined, out-at-elbow associates of his manhood and age grew utterly distasteful to him. He instinctively recognised the dignity and worth of the gentlemanly surgeon, and it seemed to restore to him a part of that personal manliness and self-esteem which he had so persistently and recklessly thrown to the four winds of heaven. James Greystone's experience told him besides that the comrades of pleasure and idleness would ere long desert the sick man ; he noted the gradual isolation which was slowly encompassing father and daughter, and might have calculated to an hour the time when the sinking man and helpless girl would stand alone in the deserted lodgings. Laurent Noel alone had remained constant in his visits ; the doctor rarely called without finding him with Grace in the Bertalls' only sitting-room, offering all the consolation in his power, and making earnest inquiries about the invalid's health. But the young man was suddenly summoned to Calvados by an aged and well-to-do female relative, and dared not, in the interest of his future"], [27, "How Tom Bertall Shifted his Responsibilities. 23 expectations, disobey her mandate. Common humanity, therefore, made it imperative on the surgeon not to transfer the care of his patient to some colleague who, if less occupied than himself, might still be more exacting on the question of fees, and even less indulgent to the desultory habits of the English menage. One rainy afternoon in late September, when the shortening days and lingering twilights con spired to give him some immunity from brain work before his laborious vigils began, Dr. Grey stone bethought himself with something like remorse that nearly a fortnight had elapsed since he had looked in at the Rue des Feuillandines ; half reluctantly he sacrificed his intended stroll, turned into the narrow street, and began the ascension of the not over clean staircase. When ho reached the upper floor he found.it unnecessary to pull the faded cord of the bell, as the door leading to the apartment was ajar. He pushed it open and entered the dingy wains cote! parlour combining vestibule and dining room, so common in Paris houses. No light was burning, although night had fallen, so it was some time before he became aware that he was not alone. A woman was sitting at the round centre table, her head lying prone on her outstretched arms. He drew closer, and recognised Grace. He gently touched her shoulder with his hand. She started and looked up ; her face was flushed and"], [28, "Doctor Greystone. \u25a021 swollen with crying. She had apparently been asleep, for it took her a moment or two to recover herself, then she suddenly rose with a stifled cry and flung herself on Dr. Greystone's breast, with loud sobs. \" Oh, bore you are at last,\" she cried hysteri cally. \" Take me away. Why did you not come before ? I have no one but you, now that he is dead.\" \"Dead/ \" \"Oh, yes. LastMonday. Did they not tell you?\" Inexpressibly shocked, James Greystone, gently disengaging himself, placed the girl in a chair, and standing beside her attempted to elicit the particulars of the catastrophe. He gathered at last from her rambling, incoherent statements that poor, restless Tom Bertall had passed from a fit of eoma to the deeper stillness of death without recovering consciousness. In the grey morning the little maid had found him stiff and cold in his bed. The parish doctor, the hideous \" croquc mort,\" had been summoned by the concierge ; the hard, hasty formalities of French law had been complied with ; the burial had taken place within thirty-six hours ; the seals that were applied to the rickety bureau by the Commissaire de Police removed, the few saleable goods disposed of to defray expenses, and on the morrow Grace Bertall would be on the streets of Paris, homeless, father. less, penniless j"], [29, "How Tom Bertall Shifted his Responsibilities. ' 25 Once again, at the conclusion of her piteous tale, she attempted to fling herself in Greystone's arms, and broke out in inarticulate despairing mutterings, in which he caught at intervals such words as these : ' ' You are my only hope ! my only salvation ! my good angel, the only one I love on this earth.\" Impatient and half irritated by this exaggerated demonstration, he somewhat stiffly withdrew himself, and commenced to remonstrate in cool, grave tones with the weeping girl, exhorting her to master her sorrow and to consider the future. He had noted already how little of real grief and mourning there was for the dead father, how much of pity for herself in the utter abandonment of weak and impotent misery ; he felt with dismay that his words were powerless to quiet or encourage her. His clear, strong commonsense failed to see any possible issue to her helpless position. He was conscious that his most plausible suggestions, his most reasonable plans became suddenly impracti cable when met by her absolute lack of responsive energy, and the nerveless, tearful, almost reproach ful answer of Grace, \" Oh, I can't do that.\" A bright thought struck him. \" Miss Bertall,\" he said, after a longer pause, \" my mother's house in England is small and very quiet, but it is home. Make it yours for awhile. I shall see that you reach it in safety, and I can answer that you will meet with a kind and cordial reception,\""], [30, "26 Doctor Greystone. For the first time Grace was roused to some thing like determination ; she looked up quickly, and her voice had lost nearly all its querulous apathy as she said, \" No, no, doctor, I will not leave Paris. How can you ask such a thing?\" Then, altering her tone to one of coaxing entreaty, she laid both her hands on his folded arms and continued, \" Don't send me away so far, away from all my friends,\" seemingly forgetting that she had pleaded her utter isolation a few moments before. \"Away from Laurent Noel, who is my \u2014 who was my father's best friend, and who may return any day \u2014 next week, perhaps.\" As Dr. Greystone remained silent her manner altered once more ; with something like petulance she seized his hand, and pressing it to her bosom looked into his eyes, saying caressingly, \"Dear Doctor Greystone, I can't part from you. Oh ! let me stay some where \u2014 anywhere. Take me with you for a little while. I will keep house for you, mend your socks, prepare your coffee in the morning. \u2014 I shan't take much room, or burden you long. Oh, do, do take me away with you, for how can I live \u2014 alone ? \" Her words were accompanied by foreign gestures and inflections that had become habitual to her in her long residence abroad, and which as a rule irritated and offended Dr. Greystone ; but the wailing pathos with which her voice died out on the last sad word touched a dormant sense"], [31, "How Tom Bertall Shifted his Responsibilities. ' 27 within him. Her pale expressionless features had suddenly flushed with emotion, her pulseless languor had vanished under a febrile anxiety ; she seemed another creature. He looked at her in thoughtful silence ; a deep pity filled his heart, a new tenderness stole over him ; to leave such a one fighting the hard battle of life alone became suddenly an impossibility. He was a man after all, and before him in the darkened room rose a pale, pure vision, evoked by his generous sympathy; he saw a grateful, submissive, devoted woman, ministering to his wants, illuminating the dark ness of his home, softening the severity of his sur roundings, coming like a gleam of sunshine to his lonely hearth ; a woman to be protected and sheltered, perchance a daughter for his widowed mother. Yet the instincts of a w*hole lifetime put in their claim. What would become of his cherished independence, his liberty, his consecra tion to science, the vocation and labours that were to benefit humanity, and make him the benefactor ? He must remain free. Grace Bertall had fallen back in her low chair, in her old listless attitude \u2014 suddenly a wet cheek was laid against his hand, warm lips pressed his fingers, and a deep sob sounded through the gloom. After a short silence, he spoke with grave resolve : \" You are right, Grace Bertall ; you cannot stand alone ; I will take you home. But listen,\" he"], [32, "28 Doctor Greystone. continued, in answer to a half-uttered cry of joy, \" you can come to me only as my wife.\" \" Your wife ? \" she exclaimed. \" As your wife ? \" Her tone was one of incredulous protest. \" Yes ! As my wife. Do you consent ? \" She was silent. She seemed to be weighing some remote possibilities in her mind, to seek the answer to a troubled problem. At last, quietly, coldly, almost reluctantly, she rose, placed her hind in Jamas Greystone's outstretched palm, and said very low \u2014 \"Yes, thank you.\" This was his wooing. He liked her none the less for this unexpected reserve, yet a sense of something discordant chilled him in that first hour of his generous impulse. His was, however, too self-contained a nature to belong impressed by passing sensations ; he knew he had linked his future for good or evil, for weal or woe, with the future of that girl, and that come what might he would do his duty by her. CHAPTER III. DB. GKEYSTONE EETUENS HOME UNEXPECTEDLY. As there had been no courtship, so there was no long engagement. The contract so suddenly entered into was ratified with the shortest possible delay ; the marriage ceremony was performed a fortnight after Tom Bertall's death in tho quiet"], [33, "Dr. Greystone Returns Home Unexpectedly. 20 fashion which would at all times have suited the taste of the bridegroom, and which the deep mourning of the bride rendered imperative. Old Dr. C and the beadle were the witnesses, a few women and children composed the congrega tion ; the newly wedded pair signed their names in the registers of the British Embassy, and became man and wife. Mrs. James Greystone reigned in the whilom bachelor establishment, which a few simple preparations had fitted for its new requirements ; some additional furniture had gladdened the bare lodgings, hut \u2014 significant precaution \u2014 a room had been set apart exclusively for the Doctor's sole use and occupation ; his books, papers, and manu script were to abide there in undisturbed posses sion, and it was an accepted provision that, what ever liberty Grace enjoyed in her own domain, that quiet stud}* at the end of the passage, with its separate egress on the back staircase, was not to be intruded upon at any hour of the day or night. Greystone's life seemed but little changed by his marriage after all. A woman, albeit his wife, could hold but an unimportant place in his well filled existence ; science and labour, as of yore, engrossed his thoughts and most of his time. He fulfilled to the letter the task he had accepted ; he was a kind, forbearing, indulgent husband, never showing by word or sign that he felt the"], [34, "Doctor Greystone. irksomenessof the idle, desultory, irregular ways of his young wife. He would listen quietly for a while to her meaningless prattle, and with a nod and smile leave her to return to his beloved occupations. He bore with wonderful patience the late rising, the querulous complaints of ill health, the total absence of all sympathy with or comprehension of his pursuits, the easy indolence with which she accepted or resigned his society. If he had for one brief hour thought that per chance he might find a companion in the girl he had made mistress of his home, his illusions were promptly and radically dispelled, but he never owned even to himself that he had met with a disappointment. It is doubtful whether he even felt it at any time to be one. He accepted her as she was, with her passive good temper, her complex nature, at once stolid and pliant, her imperviousness to enthusiasm, and her helpless ness ; they were the reason and apology of the step he had taken, and after the first few weeks he for ever relinquished any attempt to correct or improve her. She was his wife, good and pure, docile and true ; he tried to be content. About six months after Grace's marriage, Laurent Noel returned to Paris ; the aged relative had died and left him comparatively rich and wholly independent of his father. He had come as ready to share his inheritance with Bertall's penniless daughter as he would have shared his"], [35, "Dr. Greystone Returns Home Unexpectedly. 31 poverty, when he heard of the spendthrift's death and Grace's marriage. With characteristic philo sophy he felt more surprise and amusement than pain at the cool infidelity of the girl who had been so free in her expression of love and devotion, and at the same time a piqued curiosity to see how she bore herself in her matronly estate possessed him. At the first opportunity he claimed acquaintance with the English surgeon, reverted to the past episode in the Rue des Feuillandines with kindly concern, and was at once invited by Dr. Greystone to call on his wife. Grace appeared in no ways discomposed at meeting her old sweetheart, she seemed to feel neither shame, regret, nor embarrassment, and if she had retained the memory of the past love passages and tender promises, she suffered no trace of it to be visible, save in the half appealing, half caressing grace of voice and manner, which had all its old charm for the young medical student. The habits of easy goodfellowship established in other days, in the Rue des Feuillan dines, were resumed in the Rue du Cherche Midi ; the Doctor made Laurent Noel welcome; not only on account of that unconscious sympathy he had always felt for him, but because he was naturally courteous and hospitable in his careless absorbed fashion, and that he was pleased to see his young wife drawn out of her listless indolence, by companionship more suited to her age and tastes"], [36, "32 Doctor Greystone. than his own. When he returned home from lectures or conference, he would listen indulgently to her descriptions of walks or little expeditions, in which Laurent had been her escort, and retire to his study, leaving the young man with her in the sitting-room, to plan new outings and fresh pleasures. A congress of specialists had met in Paris. Science had sent its representatives from all parts of the civilized world, to discuss the controverted topic of vivisection, and the sittings were numerous and protracted. Dr. Greystone was listened to with deference by his colleagues. He spoke with the earnest eloquence of a profound conviction, as the apostle of a new crusade against prejudice and precedent. He used to leave home after snatching a hasty meal, to return late, excited, triumphant, and exhausted. One afternoon, in the middle of a sitting, he missed some important notes, which he believed he had brought with him, and which contained facts indispensable to the clear refutation of the frguments of his most powerful opponent. He would trust no messenger to fetch the papers, so consulting his watch, and finding he had a few moments to spare before it was his turn to speak, he left the Sorbonne, jumped into a passing \"remise,\" and quickly reached his own door. He passed the porter's lodge, unheeding a hasty, frightened exclamation from a female voice"], [37, "Dr. Greystone Returns Home Unexpectedly. 33 within, ran up the back staircase, and with his latchkey let himself into his study. He remained transfixed on the threshold. Before him in the calm, austere, silent room, impregnated as it were with the atmosphere of his grave labours, thrown into bold relief by the broad arrow of light streaming through the uncurtained window, stood his wife clasped in the arms of Laurent Noel ! At the sound of the key in the lock she had turned her head towards the door, and her pale eyes, widened by a nameless fear, were fastened on her husband's entering figure. For a second, which seemed an age, not a word was uttered, not a gesture was made \u2014 then the spell was broken. Grace slipped suddenly from the loosening grasp of the young man, a dark pallor swept over her face as she fell to the ground, where she lay motionless, while her lips straight ened themselves in two blue lines above the white teeth. Laurent Noel, apparently unheeding her, advanced a step or two mechanically, and addressed James Greystone in tones that trembled only very slightly. \" Monsieur,\" he said, \" as I cannot explain my presence in your room satisfactorily, I am ready to give you any reparation you may demand of me. I am at your orders, but allow me,\" \" Stop,\" sternly interrupted the Doctor, coming forward and looking attentively at the prostrate form of the woman lying almost at their feet. c"], [38, "Doctor Greystone. 34 Instinctively the young man followed that keen scrutinizing glance, a white horror came into his face, he fell on his knees beside her and mur mured, \" Great God, she is dead ! \" \"Yes,\" said Greystone, solemnly. Laurent Noel rose. \" On my honour, Mon sieur, she is innocent \" ; then almost involuntarily he added, \"Poor child.\" \" Silence,\" imperatively commanded the Doctor. \" You have neither the right to defend or to pity her. On your conscience rests this day's work. I ask no questions. Go, her memory shall remain unsullied by your advocacy or my anger. The only reparation you can make to her,\" he con tinued, disregarding a hasty movement of the young man, \"is never to mention her name; to me, to leave my presence and this home for ever. Go! ... \" He moved slightly to one side to allow Laurent Noel to pass. The young man hesitated as if he would have protested once more, or at least given a farewell look to the motionless form, but a stern repetition of the command to depart defeated his intentions. In silence, with bowed head, he passed before the husband, who held the door open, and left the room. He heard the quick reclosing and locking of the door behind him as he stood for a moment irresolute on the landing \u2014 instinctively he stopped and listened,"], [39, "Dr. Greystone Returns Home Unexpectedly, si.\") but, hearing no further sound, he slowly began to descend the stairs. Half way he met Marie, the Doctor's servant. She stopped him. \" Ah, Mon sieur Noel,\" she exclaimed with the volubility of self-defence, \" I could not stop Monsieur Grey stone just now \u2014 I could not warn you or Madame in time \u2014 I hope there's no harm done, but Madame is so childish \u2014 she is no good at all in a case like this, no good at all.\" Laurent pushed the girl impatiently aside ; he dared not tell her of the silent figure in the study upstairs, and did not trust himself to speak. Yes, Madame was very childish ! He ought to have remembered that and kept away. Why had he yielded to the temptation of renewing his fond, foolish flirtation with Grace Bertall ? Why indeed ? when he loved and reverenced her husband, when he had found out her shallowness, her weakness, her frailty, when. . . . Had he kept away she would have forgotten him, been happy; she would not have met that sudden, mysterious punishment \u2014 she would be living now. . . .

WHAT HE SAW IN THE FUTURE. When James Greystone had locked his study door upon himself and the woman he had made his wife only one short year ago, a great shadow seemed to fall upon him. His first professional glance had told him that life was extinct, his professional skill had ascertained the cause of death. He had known for a long time what the manner of that death would be when it came \u2014 sudden and unprepared ; he knew that at any moment under a great strain or a strong emotion the poor weak heart might cease to beat. Grace was doomed, but with care, shielded from harm, she might have lived on for many years a passionless, uneventful life. Had she been thus cared for, thus guarded from any shock of surprise, terror, or remorse ? Was it remorse that had killed her? He started. His outraged manhood sent a rush of burning blood to his colourless face. But presently he drove the accusing doubt away. It was not for him to be her judge. By what right was he to condemn or upbraid her ? \u2014 he had never loved her ! He was her husband, it is true, but she had not been to him the one perfect woman, winning his regard, his devotion, his passion ; she had never awakened in him the ardent feelings of the lover, never compelled the"], [41, "What he Sair in Hie future. 37 trusting reverence Of the man. She had possessed bis name : never his heart. lie lifted her prostrate body nn a narrow couch, and mechanically performed the few perfunctory rites whirli the incessant recurrence of death-bed scenes had ma.de drearily familiar to him. He closed the lustreless blue eyes, veiling the now vacant gaze under the white eyelids. The lace scaled by the mysterious touch of death told no late; the woman would carry to the grave the secrets of her Life. James Greystone resolutely refrained from mentally questioning what those secrets were ; he put away from him obtruding memories of disregarded indications in tlie past, and which in the revealing light of the present assumed a poignant significance, for they seemed to point to a remoter understanding between Grace and Daurent Noel. He curbed his proud anger at the insidious suggestion that he had been made a tool and a dupe ; that he had like any schoolboy been entrapped into this unnecessary marriage by the false tears of a foolish girl smarting under the momentary desertion of a tickle lover. He wrestled with the denouncing phantoms of doubt and suspicion, for in what name should In- arraign her, when he knew in his innermost soul that he felt ho jealousy he had not loved her I An uneasy, unconscious instinct told him that own in his loyally and uprightness he was not entirely blameless. When he rescued"], [42, "38 Doctor Greystone. that girl from want and poverty, sheltered her from the material perils of her abandonment, with easy indulgence gave her liberty, and with careless confidence, independence, he had not fulfilled all his duties towards her. He had not striven to gain her trust ; he had not sought to know her mind ; he had left her exposed to all the dangers created by his own indifference \u2014 he had not loved her. In this lay her excuse and her absolution. It pleaded in her dead face against the vision of that moment when he had seen her blonde head resting on Laurent Noel's breast. Maybe in that softened mood he heard again the voice of the young man he had liked, pledging his honour on Grace's innocence. He was man of the world enough to know what such vindications are worth, and how in such a case perjury becomes a necessity ; but there had been the ring of truth in Laurent's earnest disclaimer, and he at least had loved her. Evening had drawn in while James Greystone was holding his sombre self-communion ; shadows were deepening in the little room and forming a dark background to the immobile figure on the narrow couch, throwing it out in white relief. The Doctor, generally so calm and self-collected, had lost all account of time, and he was startled by a knock at the door twice repeated. Mechani cally he looked up and said : \" Come in.\" The handle rattled, then a voice answered : \" Monsieur,"], [43, "What he Saw in the Future. 39 I can't. The door is locked. But it is only to know if Madame is at home ; dinner is getting cold in the salle-a-manger.\" Marie spoke hesitatingly, artificially, as if in venting some excuse for her intrusion, and yet the homely words roused Greystone from his musings, and recalled him to the reality of the situation. Yes, Madame was at home ! She had never been out ! And he, James Greystone, her husband, had been locked in that room with his dead wife for hours, and had given no sign. Her limbs were stiffening already in the rigour of death, and yet he, a surgeon, well acquainted with the immediate formalities and declarations obligatory in Paris, had made no public announce ment of the fact, had called in no attendants, had not even had her removed to her own apartment ; attempted none of the ordinary methods of re storing animation, which, useless as he knew them to be, are always tried, to soothe the anxiety of the survivors. And he was living in a crowded house, in the midst of a dozen or more inquisi tive gossipping fellow-lodgers on each floor, subjected to the unceasing antagonistic espionage of the concierge, in whose narrow lodge he knew full well that the reputation of every inmate was discussed, and their slightest action misrepre sented and exaggerated. He curtly bid Marie return to her kitchen. \" I am coming round pre sently,\" he added."], [44, "40 Doctor Greystone. He had the intuition that his answer was suspiciously received, and that an eye was being applied to the keyhole. Instinctively he placed himself between the door and the couch, where the rigid form was slowly taking the elongated and sculptural lines of death. A little shuffling on the landing, and the baffled footsteps retreated regretfully and noiselessly. A new uneasiness possessed Greystone ; un nerved by excessive labour and long vigils, the suddenness of the shock told upon him more than he knew. The consequences of the past few hours rose before him with grave import, and to his morbid mind seemed to close round him with inexorable fatality. There would be an inquest \u2014 inevitably. The parish doctor, \" the doctor of the dead,\" would be summoned to make his declaration, but be would hesitate perhaps in his simple duty, and the series of awkward ques tions and suppositions would commence. The practitioner would note, as he had done himself, the few drops of blood trickling from a slight cut in her hair, near the left ear, where she had fallen on a surgical instrument lying on the floor, red stains which he had neglected to wash off. The cause of the death would be found to be aneurism \u2014 there could be no doubt or uncertainty there, but how brought about? Who had been present ? What had preceded or followed the catastrophe ? The servant, and the porter, and"], [45, "What lie Saw in the Future. 41 the porter's wife, would be called upon to give evidence ; the visit of Laurent Noel sworn to ; its duration, his presence in the unused study, his sudden exit following upon the unexpected return of Doctor Greystone would be recorded. And suddenly it seemed to him that the study had lost its air of orderly and serene repose \u2014 its atmosphere of grave silence ; the furniture appeared deranged, as if after some struggle or vengeful deed. It would assuredly strike the Commissaire de Police that it was so, for he was certain now that the presence of that functionary would be deemed necessary ; and then in dreary sequence he saw the interrogatory before the Juge d'lnstruction, the cross-examination, and the disclosure of those darker passages in his erring wife's life to which he had so resolutely closed his eyes. To do him justice, he thought more of her name and memory desecrated before the public than of bis own spotless honour bared to the gibes and curiosity of the crowd, and in vain he sought some means to save her from this last in dignity. As he sat dwelling on these possibilities, his imagination became painfully acute, and with cruel fidelity unfolded before him the vision of the future. He heard the astute pleading of his advocate, the torturing admissions elicited to win for him the immunities given by French law to the vengeance of an outraged husband, and he reddened under the implied shame. Then, later"], [46, "42 Doctor Greystone. still, he saw himself refusing those extenuating circumstances, condemned by his silence and attitude, and by the crushing weight of circum stantial evidence ; the verdict of the jury, the sentence of the judge sounded in his ears, followed by his translation to the cells of Mazas or the Conciergerie. He knew them well ; iu his pro fessional rounds he had visited the prisons and penitentiaries of Paris ; he pictured himself in the thick short vest and woollen cap of the inmates, his identity lost, his name a number. With minute and graphic exactitude, as if physiologi cally watching the effects of confinement on a patient, he imagined himself pursuing the inevi table course of a convict's term of incarceration. At first the powerful, living, active, determination to break through bolts and bars, the indignant and imperious appeals and denunciations, the sanguine expectation of seeing the sentence reversed, the audible and interminable mono logues, the eloquent unheard pleadings, the incessant rehearsing of each phase of the trial, the impatient noting of every weak point in the defence, the memory of every word which uttered or omitted would have made him free \u2014 the sombre rebellion, the sleepless nights and feverish days, the loathing of food, the exuber ance of activity intensified by the narrow limits and enforced idleness, the insane longing for air and boundless horizons born of the oppression of"], [47, "Laid to Rest. 43 the prison walls, the senseless plans of flight and evasion, the proud shrinking from the careless good-natured words of kindness of warder or in spector. Later on the slow descent into the reconciliation of habit, the weariness of revolt, the cowardice of resignation, the gradual extinc tion of hatred, wrath, and hope. Later still, the insidious encroachment of the prison taint, the apathetic submission to its rules, tasks, and regu lations, the absolute indifference to anything not within the precincts of the jail, and here Greystone shuddered and recoiled. After this, the growing interest in the sordid details of that degraded life, the satisfaction derived from an extra ration of food, from an unusual sound in the long pas sages, from the recurrence of Sunday when\" the panel was removed from the small grating in the door, and the prisoner would watch the pageant of mass at the central altar, the cringing, hypo critical demeanour to the rough officials. Ah, better by far the imbecile supineness he had witnessed and vainly tried to galvanize into the semblance of humanity in the cells of Bicetre and Charenton! CHAPTEE V. LAID TO EEST. With a strong effort, Greystone shook off the obsession of those harassing phantoms, and strove"], [48, "44 Doctor Greystone. manfully to regain his self-possession \u2014 his cooler, calmer nature responded to the appeal, and in one moment he was himself again. The beginning of action proved a healthy stimulant, and an obvious course lay before him. He rang the bell, unlocked the study door, and waited. As soon as Marie, followed at a short distance by two or three intimate friends from adjacent kitchens, keenly scenting a catastrophe, made her appear ance, he informed her that Mrs. Greystone bad been taken alarmingly ill in his study, and had passed almost instantly from life to death. Dis regarding the eloquent shoulder shrugs, uplifted hands, and suppressed exclamations of the thickening group of bystanders, but conscious of their suspicious import, be gave orders that the body of his wife should be lifted, carried into her room, and laid upon her bed. This was done in the midst of a hostile silence, broken only by such interjections as these, muttered in French : \" Ah, poor dear lady ! She won't be mourned long.\" \"Poor little woman! well, she's paid dearly for her pleasure.\" \" That conies from roasting the broom.\" \" What will you ! with such a kill-joy as her husband ! \" Marie became at once a person of importance, and in the pride of power only vouchsafed information to a chosen few, contenting herself in a general way with a melancholy shake of her white-capped head, as she murmured, \"Ah, I always said"], [49, "Laid to Rest. 45 Madame had not the sense to carry it off. Those English, they have not much of that,\" tapping her forehead with an expressive movement, which implied that whatever Marie's matrimonial career might b2, she certainly would never be found out, as that poor dear Madame Greystone had allowed herself to bo. Summoning the girl to his side, Greystone gave her a few directions, wrote a note or two, sent one of the unoccupied bystanders to summon Mr. Dufour, the public official, and left his house to S22k his old and valued friend, the venerable Dr. C , who had been the witness of his illstarred marriage. He wondered why he had not thought of this step before, and felt angry with himself at having delayed it so long. He looked at his watch. Half-past eight. Grace must have -been dead four hours. The old physician would be at home, he would have got through his dinner, and would see him at once. He walked slowly to wards Dr. C 's house. He seemed in no hurry to get there, time had suddenly become of no ac count, and a strange deliberation had taken the place of his previous hesitation. He was ushered by the servant, who knew him well, into the Doctor's consulting room. Presently the Doctor himself walked in, his dinner napkin in his hand, and in his cheery mellow voice greeted him. \" So it is you, young man. I couldn't believe Francois when he said so. Don't you know"], [50, "46 Doctor Greystone. I dine at seven, the good old-fashioned hour, and not in the middle of the night, as you do beyond the Channel? But come with me to the dining room, we'll have the potage warmed up again.\" \"Not for me, thanks, Doctor ; but when you have quite finished your dinner, may I speak with you for five minutes \u2014 here?\" \"You are not ill?\" asked Doctor C seriously. \" No, not ill, but for all that I want your advice.\" Something unnatural in the Englishman's tone and manner struck the elder man. He looked at him keenly, threw his napkin on a table, sat down in a large, worn leather arm-chair, crossed his legs, and looking straight before him, said briefly, \" What is it ? \" Seeing those two men opposite to each other, it would appear as if they had only met for a medical consultation, such as that room had so often witnessed, so measured and grave were their voices, so unemotional their manner. \" My wife died this afternoon of the rupture of an aneurism,\" said Greystone, after a short pause, and with an almost inaudible catching of his breath. The old man instinctively felt that no sympathy was required, no condolence expected. He gave neither, and answered quietly, \" What determined"], [51, "Laid to Rest. 47 the accident? Had she been ailing?\" he con tinued, as Greystone remained silent. \" No.\" \" You could not have been wholly unprepared, yet some cause must have precipitated the catastrophe.\" \" Yes, a shock. I came upon her suddenly in my study.\" The piercing black eyes of the old surgeon flashed a sharp look into Greystone's face, his penetration, or perhaps a long experience, guessed the truth. \"Was she alone?\" he asked, simply. \"No,\" curtly returned Greystone. There was a silence. The old surgeon was the first to break it. \"You have not come here, Greystone,\" he began, \"only to communicate this misfortune. Be frank, entirely, unreservedly frank. I need not tell you, a colleague, that there are few wounds which it is not our fate to probe, our mission to heal ; that a doctor is a confeSsor, and that, he can hear, under stand, excuse everything.\" He held out his hand, which Greystone grasped fervently. '' Begin,\" he continued, \"hide nothing, extenuate nothing. I listen.\" \" Thank you,\" said the younger man. \" You are right.\" Without exaggeration, but without reticence, he unfolded the events of the last few hours, con fining himself strictly to facts, carefully avoiding"], [52, "48 Doctor Greystone. the slightest commentary, dwelling only at some length on the unaccountable delay in not sum moning assistance ; he only withheld Laurent Noel's name, and, with his eyes obstinately fixed on the same pattern of th 3 carpet, declined to note the effect of his narration on his aged friend. When he had finished, Dr. C rose and stood up before the mantelpiece, gently tapping the marble with his fingers. When Greystone looked up, he saw that he was very grave. After a silence he spoke, weighing his words : \" My friend, what you tell me is serious. More than that, regrettable. You have blundered egregiously ; run your head in a noose. Your story is true, but not plausible. I foresee unplea sant consequences. We are as a nation greedy of a sensational scandal, and we do not avenge our conjugal misadventures in law courts \u2014 as you do in England. In France a husband is too apt to take the law in his own hands. I cannot let 3*ou hope that a simple mortuary declaration will be sufficient \u2014 there will be an inquest \u2014 perhaps worse. The only point in your favour is the de parture of the the young man. There is no time to be lost. I will return with you to the Rue du Cherche Midi, and in presence of Mr. Dufour, of the fifth arrondissement, give my medical testimony as to the primary causes of death. I am known to be your adviser, and,\" he added with modest pride, \" my name has some vPght in"], [53, "Laid to Rest. 49 Paris. This is all that can be done for the present ; if the suture presents other complications, depend upon me, and I will pull you through as sure as my name is Honore C .\" Greystone winced at this paternal partisan ship. It seemed to give shape and substance to the vague shadowless visions of his past morbid sensitiveness. Silently he followed the old doc tor through the gas-lit thoroughfares, and when they reached his house, he was conscious, even as soon as he stepped under the porte coeldrc, of an accession of curiosity and a murmur of re probation. Dr. C might have been aware of it too, for he ostentatiously linked his arm in Grey stone's, and without relinquishing it ascended the staircase, interrupting his friendly conversa tion with his friend to acknowledge by a cheery nod the respectful salutations of the whispering groups, who parted to let him j>ass. Side by side they entered the room where Grace Bertall was lying in her dreamless sleep. The apartment had already taken that hushed and solemn air which the one unparticipating presence communicates, and which pious respect for the dead intensifies. Tall candles burnt with straight flames at the head of the bed, a sheet fell in rigid draperies over the corpse, leaving the head uncovered ; the brass mountings of a crucifix gleamed between the folded hands, and the tender, innate reverence of even the least educated in France had D"], [54, "50 Jkietor Greystone. strewn a few cheap sweet-scented flowers on the pillow, while tho white wings of a Sister ot St. Vincent'a head-dress overshadowed the un- ruffled profile of tho nun watching in prayer at the foot of tho bud. But, marring the poetical sanctity of that picture, was the coarser element represented by the vulgar officials performing their perfunctory duties ; in rusty black, pen in hand, Mr. Dufour and his acolyte, seated at a table by the window, were taking down the con- flicting evidence of the different inmates of the house. They had been such as to necessitate the presence of the Conimissaire de Police. Pierre, the little boy of the concierge, had been dispatched to the station, immensely elated by the dignity of his mission, and chafing at his mother's stern command to put on his Sunday cap, as more befitting his character of emissary, than his battered straw hat. The formalities were sus pended till the arrival of the dignitary, but a fresh impetus bad been given to the morbid curiosity of the crowd. Dr.C 's presence gave a new turn to the pro ceedings, He exchanged a few words with Mr. Dulbur, whose manner to the illustrious surgeon instantly became as obsequious as it had been insolent and careless before, and no doubt, bad he arrived a few minutes earlier, the Croque mort's conscience would have experienced no qualms in giving his usual declaration. It was"], [55, "Laid to lies/. 51 too late, however, now to recall little Pierre, and an embarrassed silence reigned till the Com missaire made his appearance. A rapid interrogatory ensued. The wheels of tlie great judicial engine had seized their victim, and would not release it ; the officer of the law with polite regret declared it was his duty to arrest James Greystone, native of Calthorpe, Shrop shire, Great Britain, under the suspicious circum stances attending his wife's demise. Bail was immediately offered by Dr. C , and accepted by the Conimissaire, who departed with his staff, The room was authoritatively cleared by the old surgeon ; the body was left to the pious vigils of the nun, and Greystone retired to his room, stunned, dazed, but, above all, physically tired out. His friend forced him to take some food. Later on, be slept deeply, soundly, peacefully, under bis own roof; it was the healing reaction which, when it comes in time, saves the brain of man from giving way, and the heart of woman from breaking. The next morning- James Greystone woke up very calm, very strong, but with an uneasy con sciousness that he was no longer the same man who had risen tin' day before, and gone so calmly and earnestly to the Scientific Congress of the Sorbonne. The all-engrossing object of his life seemed to have becomo suddenly dwarfed and removed to an incommensurable distance ; his"], [56, "52 Doctor Greystone. interest in it remote and impersonal. He was scarcely troubled by the thought that his place would remain empty that day among his col leagues ; he had no regret for the interruption, no longing for the resumption of his daily labours. The sudden and violent emotion of human shame and sorrow had loosened his unswerving alle giance to the dispassionate but exacting claims o science ; he had become a man, and ceased to be only an apostle and a pioneer. He felt at once a great loss and a new responsibility : the loosen ing of a bond and the taking up of fresh duties. His clear, concise answers to the Juge d'In struction impressed the keen, experienced magis trate favourably ; his excellent reputation, the weight of the testimony of Dr. C- and other eminent men, his unimpeachable character* while in Paris, even his old unimpassioned manner, refuted with irresistible power the damning evidence brought against him. The voluble advocacy of Marie, anxious to explain and to prove how justifiable would have been her master's anger taken as reprisals, was impotent to bias the opinion of the Juge d'lnstruction. He de clared there was no case to send to trial, and Greystone left his office perfectly cleared. The certificate of death from natural causes was granted without delay, and twenty-four hours later Grace Greystone was laid in an obscure corner of Pere La Chaise ; a black cross, with the"], [57, "/{tone. 53 initials G. G. aud the date, were the only record of her short life. At dusk on the same day, a young man asked the guardian of the huge cemetery where the newly-dug grave of the English Doctor's wife lay, and having found it, in the growing darkness and silence he knelt beside the mound, pi tilled from his breast pocket a small bunch of violets, dropped it tenderly on the dark, clotted earth, then rose, and, without looking back once, walked quickly away. It was Laurent Noel. The next morning he left Paris, and his fellow-students of the School of Medicine saw him no more. CHAPTER VI. ALONE. WrTH the closing of the short chapter of his married life, James Greystone resolved to put away all its disturbing memories, to silence har rowing doubts, and to dismiss useless regrets. It was his firm intention to drop at once and quietly into the busy repose of his old studious bachelor days. But he found this an impossibility. A hitherto unknown restlessness possessed him, a fitful weariness and inability to concentrate his mind on the familiar subjects with a moody uneasi ness, that caused him to shrink from encounter ing old friends, and deterred him from seeking fresh surroundings. Guided by the advice of Doctor"], [58, "54 Doctor Greystone. C . he had at once left the Rue du Cherche Midi, with its lugubrious associations and ill appeased gossip, and carried his few possessions to another quarter of Paris, where he was com paratively unknown and unnoticed. The Con gress had concluded the sittings without him, the months of the long vacation had begun ; the Sorbonne and the Academy of Medicine were closed, and the hospitals, to which, suffering having no holiday, there comes no surcease of labour, had lost for him their interest as a fruitful field of research and observation. He who had never known a day's illness or an hour of fatigue sud denly felt an unconquerable lassitude, and yet no desire for repose ; he lost sleep and appetite, had fits of excessive depression, alternating with feverish excitement, but he carelessly disregarded those symptoms. And yet he did not brood over the irreparable past ; he did not experience for his dead wife the passionate regret or posthumous love which is sometimes born of sudden bereave ment or unconscious remorse, with the impotency of compensation for past indifference. Neither did he dwell morbidly on the effects of the un pleasant notoriety he had achieved in his domestic drama, a notoriety swelled by the scandal-loving gossip of his fellow lodgers, and spreading with sensational details throughout the student com munity. He seemed to be somehow removed from immediate and near effects, and to be"], [59, "/done. 55 affected by a remoter cause. He was not even unhappy, but he was not himself; the per fect equilibrium of mind and body was rudely shaken. He had gone through an unsuspected ordeal, unprepared and unarmed ; if he had not actually succumbed, he had lost that impassibility which was in him less the victory over human passions than the calm serenity of untried force. En tempted in his youth, unassailed in his manhood, clad as in armour by that exclusive devotion to science which its dignity alone reclaimed from selfishness, he had relieved and healed every form of pli3*sical suffering, and never admitted the pos sibilities of mental pain ; when the blow came to him through the girl he had called wife, and the young man he had called his friend, it shattered the armour of the physician, and revealed the man, One day, unable to bear his restless isolation, to cope with this new uneasiness, unwilling to return to England, with his mission unfulfilled, and with the sense of a double failure, his heart yearned suddenly for the presence of the only woman who had ever loved him, and he wrote to his mother to come to his side. Forty-eight hours after receiving her son's brief letter, Mrs. Greystone had finished her slender preparations, left her house in charge of the old servant, and in the early morning stepped out of the mail train in Paris. He was not at the Gare"], [60, "56 Doctor Greystone. du Nord to receive her. Wondering a little, but neither hurt nor alarmed, she drove to the address he had had the precaution to give her. A little worn by the night journey, dazzled by the noisy brightness and life of the streets even at that early hour, she took little count of the time, and thought tenderly of the happy meeting with her boy. He was her boy always ; his marriage, his widowhood, of which a few short lines had ap prized her, had not altered him in her estimation ; she only thought of him as she had always done, coming home for the holidays, and bringing glad ness and sunshine to her heart. With the smile of anticipation on her face she rang the bell at his lodgings. A sober-faced woman, clad in black, answered the summons and denied admittance. As Mrs. Greystone attempted to protest, she closed the door in her face saying \u2014 \" The patient has had a bad night, and must iiot be disturbed.\" With failing limbs, Mrs. Greystone leaned against the wall, stunned and bewildered. A dread foreboding of unutterable evil possessed her. What was going on behind that closed door ? Ere long she rallied, and rang the bell again, softly, however, mindful of those words : \"The patient must not be disturbed.\" After what seemed to her a considerable interval, the same woman, a hired nurse evidently, appeared once more. Before she could utter the impatient"], [61, "Alone. 57 remark her lips were framing, the uncourteous import of which was prefaced by her expression, Mrs. Greystone had spoken. \" I am the mother,\" she said in English. The authority of the simple, hushed words was understood by the French woman ; her face changed, she opened the door wide, stood aside to let the \"mother\" pass, and said, with a sigh of relief: \" Oh, enter there, madame, he wants you sorely.\" When Mrs. Greystone stepped into the bed room she saw her son lying on a red-curtained bed in a recess, and for a brief moment she knew him not. An altered voice hoarsely murmured : \" I knew it was her ! Mother,\" and sank to an inaudible whisper. Silently, swiftly, Mrs. Grey stone removed her bonnet and cloak, and, advancing towards the bed, pressed her lips on the hot, damp forehead. The sick man closed his eyes with a deep sigh of relief, slightly grasped her hand, and relapsed into the half delirious state from which her presence had roused him. James Gre}*stone had quietly fainted in the street two days before, and been carried home unconscious ; the doctor, after twenty-four hours of uncertainty, had pronounced the attack to be one of typhoid fever, accelerated by over-work or mental strain. He never was in immediate peril, but the illness was long and the recovery tedious. He accepted his mother's constant presence and gentle ministrations with silent gratitude, and"], [62, "58 Doctor Greystone. yielded himself up to her care with almost child like reliance. At first he would wander at times, but the name of Grace never fell from his lips ; later on he spoke but little, and then on the most ordinary topics ; but he would follow Mrs. Grey stone's movements about the room much as he had done when, ten years old, he had had scarlet fever, and submit to old-fashioned prescriptions and nostrums against which he would have revolted with all the arguments of medical pro gress in his days of health. In his protracted convalescence, even when he began to take faint interest in books, periodicals, newspapers, or to listen to accounts of Calthorpe neighbours and chronicles, he exchanged no confidences with his mother, or reverted to the few troublous days preceding his illness. She did not seem to wish it herself, and by common consent they dropped any allusions that inadvertently cropped up in conversation. One day he asked her point-blank : \" Did you ever hear what killed my wife? \" Mrs. Greystone hesitated one second, bend ing a little lower to catch up a stitch of her knitting, then she answered quietly : \" She was always delicate, you know, dear,\" and then she added, looking up at him kindly : \" You did your duty by her, poor thing \u2014 and God knows best, James.\" Her faith in her son was as complete, un questioning as her faith in heaven ; her charity as"], [63, "Alone. 59 great as either. Whether she ever knew any of the circumstances of her unknown daughter-in law's death, save the bare fact of the rupture of an aneurism, is doubtful. In the first painful surprise at the manner of that death and its con sequences Greystone had been indisposed to com municate the attendant details to his mother ; and if she guessed at an unrecorded tragedy, or if the vague echo of floating rumours ever reached her, her maternal instincts warned her against the danger of allowing the sick man to become aware of her cognizance. She knew that the day would come when he would pour into her bosom the burden of his secret, when he would unreservedly tell her all, and she waited as she had done all her life \u2014 waited and brought him back to his strong, healthy manhood. . But that day never came. Before James Greystone was quite ready to return with his mother to Calthorpe and finish his convalescence under the lime trees of the quaint old garden, the gentle, tender woman was taken from him \u2014 her task was ended. One evening, before retiring for the night, she kissed him on the forehead as he sat in his arm chair, and lingered awhile on the usual caress. \" You are quite yourself now,\" she said. \" There is nothing more I can do for you just at present,\" she continued, half regretfully. \"I must think of going home. God bless you, James. You have been a good son to me ! \""], [64, "60 Doctor Greystone. He had taken both her hands in his, her frail, soft, tender white hands, and, moved by a sudden impulse, he lifted them to his lips. As she with drew them she placed them for one moment on his head. It was her benison and her farewell. That night she went Home ! # * * * Paris had bocome abhorrent to Dr. Grey stone ; England held nothing for him now ; he resolved to travel. A few hasty lines informed Dr. C \u2014 \u2014 of his intentions, and without waiting for his answer he started on long, desultory wander ing*., with the instinctive, unacknowledged desire to wear out his regret by motion, to deaden his piain by change of scene, to forget his solitude in the greater isolation of nature. At times it seemed as if rail and steam could not hurry him along fast enough ; he passed through the cities of the old world without giving a glance to the treasures they contained ; he cared for nought that man had wrought or edified ; science and art had lost their power to captivate and enthral ; statues, monuments, paintings could not arrest his feverish steps ; unhinged, unnerved by excessive labour, and prostrated by his illness and the two shocks that had preceded and followed it, he shrunk from all contact with his fellow-creatures ; they could not alleviate his loss, but they helped, by awakening old associations, to make it more poignant. The stern immobility of high raoun-"], [65, "Alone. tains, the austere grandeur of uninhabited districts, soothed and calmed him ; he would tarry long in some rough hut far up among the Alps, where the sound of a tinkling cow-bell and the distant call ofa shepherd alone broke the great silence of snow and cloud, or wander idly by the side of the ice-bound Norwegian fiords till, his restless fits coming on, he would resume his erratic course, place the ocean between him and his unquiet memories, and on the burning desert sands look deep into the fathomless eyes of brazen sphynxes to read the answer to the inscrutable problem of life. Four years passed, and at last the healing influence of time and nature worked their beneficial effects ; James Greystone returned to England, resigned if not forgetful, consoled and fortified, wondering alike in his hours of retrospect at the change those four years had wrought in him, and at his long impotency to face and conquer his pain. At thirty-five, bronzed and bearded, with deep lines on his temples and silver threads in his black hair, he was handsome still, reserved and quiet as of yore, but in the man of no illusions and few ambitions nothing remained of the ardent enthusiasm of his earlier days when he dreamt of being the benefactor of humanity by the power of his genius and his will, and of making the name of James Greystone famous in the annals of science and on the lips of posterity."], [66, "62 Doctor Greystone. PAET II. CHAPTER I. THE INMATES OF MILE END VILLA. \"I've done it ! Thank me, allot' you. Who said I shouldn't \u2014 pray ? Trust me for having my own way ! \" cried a tall girl, noisily entering the morning-room of Mile End Villa, and dropping into a low wicker-work chair in the bay window. She began fanning herself vehemently with an uncut Queen she held in her hand. \" What have you done? Speak out \u2014 not but what it is some mischief coming from you, Carrie,\" rather contemptuously remarked another girl, who was standing at a square table, covering twenty-four jam pots with waste paper. \"Ob, do tell, that's a dear!\" hastily added another plumper and younger sister, noting a sudden tightening of the lips, and fearing a post ponement of the news brought by the tall girl. \" Now, do you really and truly want to know? \" she said after a little pause, evidently relenting, and, moreover, anxious to be urged. Apparently she read eager expectancy in the eyes of at least one sister, for, with an access of importance, she resumed : \" Well, I have spoken to him I \""], [67, "The Inmates of Mile End Villa. 63 The plump girl clapped her hands, and in so doing allowed a book with the yellow library label to drop unnoticed to the ground. \"No,\" she exclaimed with awed admiration, and a tinge of incredulity, \"you haven't? and where? \" \" Carrie,\" said Miss Maltby, mildly but appre hensively, tightly securing the string round her fourteenth jam pot, \" you have not done anything very outrageous, I hope?\" \" Oh, dear no,\" said Carrie, airily. \" I flatter myself it was the neatest thing out.\" Carrie was partial to a diluted sort of slang. \" That's how it happened. I saw him leaving the post-office and walking towards the station. Of course it was immediately revealed to me that I might as well get the Queen at Smith's stall as at Rendall's shop, so, following his lead, I trotted after him ; and wasn't it piping hot, just after turning into Morley Road,\" she added incidentally, as she fanned herself with retrospective vigour. \" Never mind the heat now ! \" unfeelingly said the plump listener. \" I did then, Jessie, anyhow. Well, we both got on the platform about the same time,\" resumed Carrie, forgetting to be offended at the interruption in her eagerness to relate her experiences ; \" but he, stupid owl, went poking in among the magazines, and I could not very well push up accidentally against him, or trip up his umbrella, considering we were the only living"], [68, "64 Doctor Greystone. beings in the station ; or drop my handkerchief for him to pick up, as it happened not to be even a hem-stitched one, and was much stained with black currants ; so having dawdled as much as decency would allow over the payment of the Queen, I was giving it up as a bad job, when, lo and behold, I heard him ask that idiotic squinting paper boy at the stall, ' What is this I hear of a fever down at the paper mills ? ' Jim, bless him, stared open-mouthed, and, with remarkable presence of mind, at last came out with ' And sure, sir, I don't know.' I could have hugged him on the spot, for there was my chance. So I looked up, quite blushingly and maidenly \u2014 you know, girls, I can turn on that expression if I try hard \u2014 and in a stage-aside addressed Jim : ' Will you tell the gentleman that it is a false report ? Dr. Leslie assured my father that there had been only one isolated case.' He turned at my modest accents, lifted his hat, thus,\" \u2014 and Carrie flourished her hand above her head in a way which, if it rendered the salutation of the stranger with any accuracy, also conveyed the impression of a most remarkable act \u2014 \" bowed as if I was a queen, and said : ' Thank you.' \" \"Was that all?\" exclaimed the girl she had called Jessie, in tones of contemptuous disap pointment.

I am most happy to be able to give you this reassuring information.' He seemed surprised when I came out so pat with his name.\" \" How could you tell,\" said Jessie, uncom promisingly, \" if you were not looking at him?\" \"Oh, I can see out of the corner of my eyes,\" answered Carrie. \" I thought he was .going to escape, but I wouldn't let him, and resumed quite unconcernedly : ' I hope you like this neighbour hood, Mr. Stone ? ' \" \" Oh ! Carrie,\" interpolated Miss Maltby, who was now engaged in writing \"Raspberry and Currant Jam, 188 \u2014 ,\" on the white paper lids. \" And why not? It's hospitable, it's Christian charity, it's anything you like, and it sounds well ; then ' ' A sleepy looking girl, with heavy eyelids and a pretty but stolid face, who bad been silently stitching at some crewel work, opened her lips for the first time, and without looking up said slowly, \" Then he took fright and ran away.\" \" Are you telling that story, Sally, or am I ? \" pe.u antly retorted Carrie. As there was no reply to this query, she continued exultingly, \" My dears, if I had put the words in his mouth, he E"], [70, "66 Doctor Greystone. couldn't have spoken more to the purpose. He said with his Giaour bow \" \" Is he a ventriloquist, that he does not speak with his lips?\" irreverently interrupted Sally in the same drawling voice as before. Disdaining the satire, Carrie pursued : \"He said : ' Am I correct in thinking that I am addressing Miss Maltby ? ' ' Caroline Maltby,' I answered demurely, and, striking while the iron was hot, I added like a shot, ' We are having a tennis party next Wednesday fortnight, Mr. Stone ; as we are such near neighbours will you waive ceremony and drop in ? ' ' \"Well, I never! \" exclaimed Jessie with more emphasis than elegance. \" And then ? \" \" And then he answered, 'You are very kind. Miss Maltby,' and not a muscle of his grand old face moved.\" \" You did not expect him to go into convulsions or grin like a baboon, because you offered him tennis which he probably hates, and tea which he won't drink, did you ? \" said the sleepy-eyed sister. \"Hold your tongue, Sally; he was simply entrancing.\" \" But will he come ? \" asked Jessie pertinently. Carrie was fain to confess that the interview ended then and there; that the gentleman's reception of her invitation could give no clue to whether or not he would respond to it, and that"], [71, "The Inmates of Mile End Villa. 67 upon the whole, if perfectly courteous, he had not been cordial. \" However,\" she concluded, con scious of a certain discredit thrown on her achievements by her auditors, whose silence was eloquent, \"he has been made to speak to one of us, and it is only the first 'pass' that ' cmvts.' ' Purposely exaggerating a vile French accent in the rendering of the two interpolated original words of the translated proverb, the tall girl gathered up her hat aud gloves, which she had while talking cast aside, and left the room regard less of the adjurations of her younger sisters, suddenly eager for further minuteness of details and imploringly beseeching her to \" tell us more.\" Mile End Villa, although a half suburban residence in a small country village, was in reality a good-sized house placed in the centre of five acres of pleasure grounds and kitchen gardens, with good lawns and some old trees which re deemed it from the hopeless vulgarity of other smaller and less fortunately situated semi-rural dwellings in the same locality. The property lay at the fork of two lanes, somewhat nearer Syston than Leicester, removed from the noisy mercantile outskirts of the latter city, and flanked by the outlying fields and copses of Bradgate Park. Mrs. Maltby, the presiding spirit of Mile End Villa, and mother of the four girls who had been discussing \"Mr. Stone\" in the morning room, was a north-country woman, and, as the French"], [72, "68 Doctor Greystone. emphatically style it, \" amaitresse femme.\" She had, when no longer quite young, married a London solicitor, some few years her junior, whose pro fession did not then bring him such an income as to make him indifferent to the very substantial advantages he reaped by bis union with his well portioned Cumberland bride. Arery good looking, passionately devoted to sport, condemned to a desk in his father's office as heir presumptive to the business, and already a partner, Frederick Maltby, in a simple-minded, half honest, half selfish way persuaded himself that he was in love with the rich brewer's daughter, and accepted her person and portion with becoming gratitude. Barbara was imperiously uncompromising, and wielded the conjugal sceptre, which she seized even during the early days of the honeymoon, with an autocratic hand. She was in the main a good wife for a man of business whose occupa tions removed him from her presence all day, as on his return home after a day in the city, or a run with the hounds, he found an excellent dinner, a well-swept and garnished hearth, and a severely drilled household. When old Mr. Maltby's demise, and the increasing business of the firm of which he was senior partner, added to the income of the still youthful couple, Mrs. Maltby developed an excess of importance of which the immediate result was a series of feuds with old acquaintances and relations. She kept her brougham, her"], [73, "The Inmates of Mile End Villa. 69 husband kept five hunters, she refurnished her bouse at Shepherd's Bush, he made an arrange ment with his co-partners which enabled him to hunt four days a week, and nominally remain at the head of his firm. Barbara bullied her servants, spent lavishly and a trifle ostentatiously with one hand, and was vulgarly parsimonious with the other ; she was at once blindly indulgent and unnecessarily strict with her growing family of two sons and four daughters. Her temper bad become at that time decidedly tart, and Mr. Maltby for once asserted himself to such good effect that he effectually quelled all attempts at interference in his business and pleasures, which he forthwith pursued unchallenged, while he conceded to his wife the absolute and undisputed control in all its branches of the home department. In the deep and silent enjoyment afforded by harness room and stable, in the drowsy fatigue after a long day's run, Mr. Maltby became oblivious of frequent bickerings and wrangles in his wife's domain, and grew accustomed to the constant change of servants and a suspicious redness in the eyes of his daughters. Barbara was essentially the well-to-do middle class British matron ; tall, gaunt, severe of face, heavy-browed and heavy-jawed, with a grim determination to be a model housewife, and straining every faculty of heart and intellect to attain the ever eluding perfection of absolute cleanliness and perfect"], [74, "Doctor Greystone. 70 economy, combined with the greatest amount of show wherewith to dazzle the twenty or thirty women of her own set whom she cordially hated, and would not on any consideration have failed to ask to ponderous dinners recurring w*ith the same regularity as house-cleaning. Barbara was shrewd, clever after a certain fashion of clever ness, which did not prevent her from saying foolish things, and led her into doing socially imprudent ones. She had no instruction, a great deal of mother wit, a relentless tongue, an uncontrollable freedom of expression, and in her attacks and repartees indulged in a singular licence which savoured in strange contrast alike of the ease of the ancien regime and pictur esque unconcern of the market woman. To strangers her quaintness, her north-country brogue, a certain genuine and rough kindness were, on the whole, attractive \u2014 even her ugliness had a humorous originality which riveted atten tion ; to those who knew her better she became wearisome and exacting ; to those who knew her best, a woman to be feared. At times and under certain provocations her whole nature changed \u2014 the housewife became a Nemesis ; she forgot her beloved domestic duties, abstained from scolding her servants, and centred all her energies into an ardent, almost insane, desire for revenge ; sacrificed truth, womanliness, the reputation of others, even the fair fame of her home, to the"], [75, "The Inmates of Mile End Villa. 71 insatiate passion of wreaking evil on those whom she imagined had thwarted her plans or inflicted some unintentional injury. At those times Mr. Maltby's patience and dispassionate calm were sorely tried, but experience had taught him to let the storm spend its own fury, as opposition or remonstrance only lent fuel to the flames ; but a too frequent repetition of these virulent attacks on neighbours and friends had at last seriously* impaired the social position of the Maltbys at Shepherd's Bush. The eldest daughters per sistently remained unmarried ; the eligible bachelors began to fight shy of a house to which they were too ostentatiously made welcome, and in a lucid interval Mrs. Maltby discovered that Frederick's health required a rest from business, her family a thorough change, or, in other words, that London had become too hot to bold them. What Barbara decided and gave out as neces sary was not to be gainsaid. Mr. Maltb}' allowed himself to be bought out of the business, the house at Shepherd's Bush was disposed of, the furniture temporarily warehoused, and as Mrs. Maltby fancied that country life would impart a certain gentility unattainable by those of her acquaintances whose husbands were still in \" business,\" she spent an anxious summer in seeking a habitation which would at once com bine the aristocratic pretensions she favoured and"], [76, "72 Doctor Greystone. not run counter to her ideas of thrift and econo mical management. Mile End Villa seemed to realize her dreams \u2014 the house was to be had cheap, having stood empty for some time. Barbara preferred this, as she could restore, alter, and improve it according to her own private and peculiar views, and it afforded the one item on which Mr. Maltby had declared himself inflexible \u2014 it possessed unusually good stabling, a large paddock, and was situated in the midst of a good hunting county. Sports men soon make friends, and the hopes of future sociable intercourse were founded a good deal on that axiom, for as Mrs. Maltby sagely observed : \" We have plenty to do without seeing company till the bunting season comes round, and I won't have neighbours calling and pottering here till I have got everything straight.\" However, whether the neighbours were waiting for the hunting season to commence or from some other reasons, the best people around Syston and Leicester did not hasten to leave cards on the Maltby s, and it was by very slow degrees that Mile End Villa was at all socially recognised. Towards the following spring a widow lady with an only daughter, Mrs. Turner, settled in a small country house on the other side of Syston, which had been left to her in the will of a maiden aunt. Miss Hepburn had a good connection, had been visited by the squire, Sir Everett Barston, and"], [77, "The Inmates of Mile End Villa. 73 some other well-to-do families, and Mrs. Turner inherited the recognition of the neighbourhood with the house. The Maltbys bad slightly known the widow in London \u2014 in truth, Barbara had openly and frankly ridiculed to her daughter \" the namby-pamby education that poor weak woman gives Selina Why, she'll make a perfect idiot of the girl, keeping her in leading strings at seventeen.\" The Misses Maltby had a secret contempt for shy, awkward, reticent Selina Turner, but at Syston mother and daughter at once became important, and the acquaintance was claimed with warmth, ripened into intimacy, and opened a vista of future invitations, tennis parties, and dances for the four girls, who found life in Leicestershire decidedly dull, left to their own resources. Their elder brother Edward was a junior partner in the firm of Maltby, Simpson and Co., and on that plea had remained, much to bis gratification, in London. The younger, who was only twelve, had been hitherto at school in an educational establishment in Clapham ; but, with the removal of the family to the country, his mother had deemed it more consistent with her altered fortunes to place Herbert at Eton. The ab solute necessity of the step had been impressed upon her when she heard Mrs. Rogers, the portly wife of a wealthy citizen of Leicester, who had been the first to hold out the hand of"], [78, "Doctor Greystone. 74 fellowship to Mrs. Maltby, assert somewhat ostentatiously that private schools were very well in a way ; that Westminster or King's College were quite good enough for city and professional men's children ; but that, after all, there was nothing like Eton for gentlemen's sons ; that she had sent her Harold there at nine, and, if she had fifty boys, all of them should go to Eton. Mrs. Maltby inwardly lamented the impos sibility of knocking three years off Herbert's age, but resolutely made up her mind that the suburban groves of Clapham should no longer shelter his education. So, in the privacy of her well appointed chamber in Mile End Villa, with its highly-beeswaxed, ponderous mahogany furniture, and spotless expanse of dimity, Barbara roused her lord from his beauty sleep, which he had begun early, having had an exceptionally good and fast run that day. Frederick turned uneasily ; he was not a light sleeper, and attempted to elude the summons to a midnight confabulation. His wife thwarted his designs, and tersely bade him to leave off snoring, and attend to her. \"Well! what is it, Bab?\" said Mr. Maltby, resigned and submissive. \"Herbert must go to Eton, Fred. I have nitdc up my mind to it.\" \"What, to-night?\" said Mr. Maltby, slightly confused still, but without offering any resistance. \" Nonsense ! Next term ! Do you hear ? \""], [79, "The Inmates of Mile End Villa, 75 \" Perfectly. But why should he ? Old Dick son's was good enough for Edward, and Herbert might have a go at Westminster later on.\" \"Westminster and Dickson, indeed! when Mrs. Rogers had the impudence to say \" \" And did you wake me up to tell me what Mrs. Rogers says? The deuce take Mrs. Rogers and her sayings !\" growled Mr. Maltby. \" Don't swear, Fred,\" retorted Mrs. Maltby, virtuously. \" Where my children are concerned, I care for public opinion, if you don't. A mother has to consider the future, if a man cannot spare the time to do so,\" she continued, unpinning her cap before the toilet-glass. Receiving no re sponse, she turned, and walking suspiciously to the bed, laid her hand impressively on her husband's blanket-covered shoulders : \"It's not a bit of use, Fred ! This thing must be done, and you had better settle it now than later ! \" \" Settle what ? \" said Mr. Maltby, sleepily. \" About Herbert's going to Eton. We are as good and better than those Rogers. Mr. Rogers' father made his money out of guano, and she \u2014 well, the least said about her the better ! Gentle men's sons, indeed ! and who are we, I should like to know,\" continued Mrs. Maltby, her voice and choler both rising, \" but gentlemen's sons ? \" \"Hardly that, my dear, at least as far as you are concerned,\" said Mr. Maltby, who sometimes indulged in a little quiet satire at the errors of"], [80, "76 Doctor Greystone. construction into which his wife's excitement entrapped her otherwise fluent speech. Mrs. Maltby disdained to take any notice of the interruption, and resumed, her hand still warningly pressed on her husband's shoulder to fix his wandering attention : \" Herbert must go to Eton ; that is quite settled in my mind.\" \" If it's all settled, Bab, there's nothing more to say. You had better leave further arrangements till daylight.\" And Mr. Maltby, releasing bis shoulder, was promptly wrapped in slumber. At the close of the Christmas holidays, Mrs. Maltby casually informed all her friends and visitors that \" Fred \"had decided to send Herbert to Eton, as he thought it advisable the boy should move in his own set. It had been for some years an accredited fiction in the Maltby household that its master, essentially a constitutional ruler, reigning but not governing, should be brought forward as a dictator on all important occasions. \" Fred,\" to the outer world, and \" Father \" in the arcana of home, was the reserve force brought to bear on recalcitrant wills and opinions, and with this superficial show of conjugal deference Barbara frequently helped herself out of the diffi culties into which her headstrong fanaticism had entangled her ; but it is doubtful if the device deceived any one, and the official ukase was generally brought home to the determined black browed mother, instead of the well-dressed, clean-"], [81, "Sir Eoerctt Barston, Bart. 77 shaven, sportsmanlike, silent and gentlemanly, but quietly selfish father. CHAPTER II. SIR EVERETT BARSTON, BART. Of Mrs. Maltby's four daughters, only one resembled her, the eldest, and then merely in a certain housewifely thrift, which endeared her to her parent. Miss Maltby, who looked gentle and refined, was essentially commonplace, and had neither her mother's cleverness nor her vul garity. At the comparatively early age of twenty seven, she had had a matrimonial venture, and nearly secured the affections of a fashionable and popular clergyman, but he suddenly seceded from his allegiance, and retired, drawing upon himself the bitter animosity and deadly hatred of Mrs. Maltby. Maria bore her disappointment with outward placidity, and lapsed into a mere house keeper and confirmed spinster. She was her father's favourite, and, by a curious anomaly in one so quiet and unassuming, sympathized more in his equine and sporting tastes than her dashing, wild, exuberant, second sister Carrie. Carrie was the tomboy, the hoyden, the scatter brains of the decorous establishment. At eighteen she had scarcely assumed the demeanour of a grown-up girl ; with frank audacity she pro claimed her partiality for \" larks,\" and acted up"], [82, "78 Doctor Greystone, to her tenets. She was the pride and thorn of Mrs. Maltby's existence, who boasted of her to her friends as a \" fine girl \u2014 a girl, my dear, who will do well. There is a young fellow now who worships the ground she treads upon,\" and who in the next breath would pathetically deplore that \" Carrie went on so that people would talk.\" The world's opinion was the good lady's bug bear, a fetish to propitiate when opportune, to use as a weapon when convenient, to brave when inflamed by a pugnacious spirit. Carrie had bad flhtations innumerable ; entered upon a couple of engagements, broken them as easily as she bad contracted them, come out with flying colours, fcoled half a dozen raw, adoring youths, and one or two middle-aged simpletons, and only once burnt her fingers and drawn upon herself a just but scathing reproof from a man of a higher stamp with whom she had impru dently attempted to play her hitherto successful game. But on the whole, her coquetry was trans parent and artless, more frolicsome than deep and premeditated. It was innate and natural, and there was such a sterling fund of honesty and good nature in her madcap disposition that it made her as dear to some as her uncontrollable spirits rendered her objectionable to those who judged her superficially, and, be it said, corroborated their judgment with her mother's injudicious and con tradictory commentaries."], [83, "Sir Everett Barston, Bart. 79 The most influential personage in the vicinity of Syston was by common consent recognised to be Sir Everett Barston, and through Mrs. Turner's patronage the Maltbys had at last achieved an entree into Barston Hall, and an introduction to its only female inmate, Miss Ruth Barston, the Baronet's daughter. This introduction had filled Mrs. Maltby with importance and self-gratifica tion, and been accepted by her husband with better concealed but no less sincere pleasure. Sir Everett owned the best shooting of the neighbourhood ; Mr. Maltby saw a prospect of an occasional day in his covers, and moreover, as the Baronet was often seen at the meets, and provided some hunting dinners or breakfasts, there was a chance of receiving from the great man of Syston a public recognition. Mr. Maltby affected liberal, even radical, opinions, but not with such abject consistency as to quell a little glow of satisfaction when he happened to be shaken by the hand, and familiarly addressed as \"Maltby \" by a scion of the local aristocracy. Still, honourable and gratifying as the intercourse with Barston Hall might be in the abstract, as a matter of fact it had as yet added little to the amusement and gaiety of the inmates of Mile End Lodge. It was limited to a ponderous dinner party, a school feast, and a tennis party. Sir Everett and Miss Barston had politely declined a return dinner, and had only conditionally"], [84, "80 Doctor Greystone. promised to attend the great midsummer party on the fifth of July alluded to by Carrie in her conversation with her sisters. Since that date had been fixed upon, the three younger girls had been indefatigable in extending the list of their guests, but even the possible advent of a batch of very young men from London, who were to be put up for the night, had not considerably swelled the number of gentlemen, and it was becoming a serious matter of doubt whether the stronger sex would be adequately represented all the afternoon at the four tennis courts into which every avail able inch of the Mile End lawn had been con verted. Carrie had worked heroically in the recruiting line, and qualified herself, as she said, for a press-gang ; but her dearest ambition during the last fortnight had been to enlist a good-looking stranger who had a month before taken for a term the furnished apartments of Mrs. Ralph's cottage on the common, and who had un accountably up to the present day avoided any inroad on his privacy or approach to soci ability. Carrie had a speaking acquaintance with every woman, child, and old man in the village, and was, moreover, on the most intimate terms with Mrs. Ralph, whom she frequently visited, having ascertained that she was an inveterate talker, and, as she expressed it to Jessie, \" Such fun, when you get her on the Syston people. She knows them"], [85, "Sir Everett Barston, Bart. 81 all, and a great deal more about them than they do themselves.\" Shortly after the letting of the rooms to the stranger, Carrie visited Mrs. Ralph, who was a washerwoman by trade, in her private dominion, the laundry, and, as she had confidently expected, the conversation promptly fell upon the lodger. \" You see, Miss,\" said Mrs. Ralph, with ready loquacity, interrupting her ironing with the reck less indifference to time of a thorough gossip \u2014 \" you see it's Mr. Home, of the Bull, who recom mended the gentleman to my lodgings. It's the first time as long as I can remember those rooms has been empty for a month at a stretch. They're that run after, I have had many a time to decline three parties that were after them together. You see it's not only the locality that's healthy, its the attendance that's good \u2014 and the cooking, and \" \" Oh, certainly,\" interrupted Carrie, somewhat hastily. She had so often drawn out the good woman on the merits of her furnished apartments that the repetition was becoming irksome, especially at a moment when it caused a diversion from the more important topic. \"I know how popular your rooms are, Mrs. Ralph. But what brought the gentleman to the Bull? \" \" I'm sure, Miss, I don't quite know what it is brought him there ; but he just came at first for \u00a5"], [86, "82 Doctor Greystone. a day or two ; he hadn't no luggage to speak of, beyond a battered sort of a portmantel that had seen a lot of travelling, so John, the boots, says. He went about poking in the lanes and the churches and churchyards round \u2014 many of my parties have been fond of that before, though I can't say I should be partial to it myself; anyhow, he seemed to take a sudden liking to the place, but he couldn't abide the hotel to stop at, owing to the noise on market days \u2014 and it's noisy, there's no denying it \u2014 so, seeing as how he couldn't keep him at the Bull, Mr. Home, casual like, told him he could recommend superior apartments for single gentlemen in the village, and mentioned my name.\" \" That was considerate of Mr. Home,\" inter polated Carrie. Then, anxious to give the stranger the added individuality of a personal appellation, she artfully continued, \" so he sent Mr. what name did you say?\" \" They calls him Mr. Stone, Miss, and he's as nice a gentleman as ever was. But won't you be seated, Miss ? \" said Mrs. Ralph, with a sudden access of hospitality, lemoving a pile of tightly rolled damp linen from a chair. \" Thank you,\" said Carry, acknowledging the courtesy by a practical suggestion. \"Please go on with your ironing, Mrs. Ralph. Don't let me hinder you.\" \" Well \u2014 if it's no offence to you, Miss, I will ;"], [87, "Sir Everett Barston, Bart. 83 it don't prevent me talking,\" replied Mrs. Ralph gratefully. But talking evidently interfered with the iron ing, for, after having ostentatiously taken a fresh iron from the stove, tested its heat near her cheek, wiped it on the rubber, and given a few masterly strokes on a starched shirt-front, she held the implement of her craft poised in mid-air, and, bending over the ironing-board towards her visitor, who watched her with lazy interest, she resumed \u2014 \" Of course, Miss, Mr. Home has some obliga tions to me ; he's well aware of that \u2014 my poor husband lent him money afore he died, which just kept the Bull together at the time Home took it, and Home isn't ungrateful, I will say that for him \u2014 and he did us both a good turn, the gentleman and me \u2014 yes, a good turn\" ; and she added, with unconscious appreciation of human disinterestedness, \" he knew he lost nothing by it.\" Carrie nodded, and Mrs. Ralph continued. \"Well, Mr. Stone came and visited the rooms last Monday-week ; he never haggled about the price, or the kitchen fire and extras, but just took them out and out for three months certain, perhaps more, and came in at neon the following day, which was a Tuesday \" explained Mrs. Ralph, with the unnecessary accurateness of detail which contrasts so habitually in her class with an un accountable vagueness in the rendering of im-"], [88, "84 Doctor Greystone. portant facts. \"Mr. Stone is not what I might call bumptious or a gentleman as gives much trouble ; I have known them as would take up all one's time and never say as much as by your leave ; but he is haughty-like, a sort of distant, as the saying is. Whenever I goes up to him to see if he is comfortable, he just looks up from his book or Avriting \u2014 he reads and writes a lot, he does\u2014 and says, quite polite, but not encouraging like: '\"Thank you, Mrs. Ralph. I'll ring when I want anything.' \" \" AVise man,\" said Carrie in a stage aside, lost on her hostess ; then aloud, she added diplomati cally, \" It must be a dull, stupid sort of life, though.\" Mrs. Ralph somewhat resented this suggestion, as an imputation against the attractions of her lodgings, and replied quickly: \"Oh! he don't mope, Miss ; he looks out o' window on the com mon, be takes long country walks, and goes into Leicester and passes the time quite easy. \" \" Has he no friends, no visitors?\" \" Not as yet, Miss, but it's early days for com pany. My last party but one, the Reverend Horace Curtis, didn't cotton to the place and people till two months after he took the curacy. More luggage came this week for my gentleman, cases of books and things, that had been stored away, I should say, by the looks of them, in Lon-"], [89, "Sir Everett Barston, Bart. 85 don or may be in furrin parts ; but he's never yet had a soul near him, nor seems to want it, and he don't write letters ; leastways, if he does, they don't lie about, and he posts them himself.\" Even Carrie felt that she was prying too far into the stranger's private affairs by encouraging Mrs. Ralph's garrulity to the extent of com menting on Mr. Stone's correspondence, and, somewhat ashamed of her curiosity, she rose hastily, and bidding her hostess good-bye she departed, leaving Mrs. Ralph at liberty to resume her work, poke up the fire, and heat her cold irons. This had taken place nearly four weeks ago, and from that time to the day when Carrie in her desperation had boldly propounded her invi tation to Mr. Stone at the bookstall on the railway platform, none of her man\u0153uvres had brought about even a bowing acquaintance with the stranger, which was the more provoking that, only from meeting him occasionally in the lanes or on the common, she had unhesitatingly made up her mind that he was a gentleman, that Mrs. Ralph's judgment was correct, and that, although no longer a young man, and apparently stern and even sad, it would yet be a triumph to lure him to Mile End Lodge. As the days went on, Mr. Home at the Bull had been heard to say that Mr. Stone was well connected, on what authority was not told, and"], [90, "86 Doctor Greystone. that he banked with Coutts in London. The stranger had casually observed while still at the inn that, if references were required previous to entering into any arrangement with a Syston householder, he could refer the latter either to a well-known firm of solicitors in London, or to a still better known medical man. These for malities were, however, not deemed necessary by the simple-minded Mrs. Ralph, but the bare men tion of the vouchers was sufficient to invest Mr. Stone with a halo of respectability, of which he was as unconscious as he would have been utterly indifferent to it. His small establishment consisted virtually of the whole cottage, a pretty trellissed house, redeemed from vulgarity by being bm'lt a little back from the road, and approached by an arched yew walk. Mrs. Ralph dwelt in widowed solitude in two modest rooms over the laundry, and these private premises were entered from a yard or drying ground opening into a lane diverging at right angles from the common which the front of the cottage faced. Inside, the laundry and dwelling-house communicated only by means of the kitchen, and a small but tidy orphan, hired When the occasion required, ministered under Mrs. Ralph's supervision to the wants of the lodgers, and was at odd times taught the mysteries of clear starching. It was a recognised fact that the widow had never taken"], [91, "Sir Everett Barston, Bart. 87 in but \" parties \" of irreproachable connection and antecedents, principally curates or invalids, and it had not infrequently occurred that when the lodgers had prolonged their stay for a few months, they had been admitted into the pale of Syston society, and recognised by its in fluential representatives, Dr. Leslie and his family, the Rector and his numerous flock of children of all ages, the somewhat pompous, but in the main good-hearted wife of Mr. Benyon, the solicitor, and last, but not least of later years, by Mrs. Turner, who formed the connect ing link between the social worlds of town and country. But, except for that short interview with Carrie Maltby, and the vague acquiescence of the stranger to her hospitable invitation, he had never held commune with any of his neighbours, nor even appeared conscious that they were more than willing to grant him right of citizen ship in their midst. He was, however, fast becoming a familiar figure to the outlying cottagers. In his long solitary walks he would stop and converse with a farm labourer or navvy about crops and drainage, and even render some trifling assistance to the poorer inhabitants. One day a child had fallen heavily, almost at his feet, from the bare back of a recalcitrant and long-suffering donkey, upon a heap of broken stones. Mr. Stone had not only picked up the"], [92, "88 Doctor Greystone. insensible boy, and carried him into an adjacent farm building, but he had dressed the cut on his temple and restored him to consciousness with such calm authority and deft manipulation, that he had impressed the bystanders with the profoundest admiration for his cleverness and skill, and elicited unflattering comments upon Dr. Leslie's professional ability in similar cir cumstances. A substantial bounty, and a quiet but sharp reproof given to the mother of the little lad for her want of supervision over so small a child, rendered him on the spot the most popular man in the district. \"He knows what's what,\" was the verdict; \" and he's no fool, I can tell you.\" \"I know a man when I sees him,\" added Bill Sloames, the recognised orator of the Brad gate Arms, \"and I can tell you he's the right sort; none of your turnip and water milksops, like them fine gentlemen at the Park, with a glass cocked up in one eye as big as a window pane. But I'll bet you half-a-quartern all round that that chap bas seen trouble of some kind or other afore he came down here. \u25a0 There's a look about his eyes, and a ' let me alone or tell the reason why' manner in his walk that's not that of one with whom the world has wagged the right way. And,\" continued Bill Sloames oracu larly, \"if that Mr. Stone isn't running away from something dark that keeps him awake of"], [93, "\" Mr. Stove.\" 89 nights, my name isn't Bill Sloames, and I'm a bigger fool than I look. That's all.\" Mr. Sloames, wheelwright and smith of Syston by profession, poacher by taste and opportunity, inclining to rationalistic and socialistic opinions, held in respectful awe by the village, suspected and disliked by the gentry, was right in his estimation of Mrs. Ralph's lodger. He had a past, a dark and troubled past, one on which he had brooded so long that he shrank with morbid fear from the possibility of its being discussed and commented upon ; he had known sorrow and repentance, he had forgotten or outlived neither. He was Doctor James Greystone. CHAPTER III. \"MR. STONE.\" He had not deliberately come to Syston under a false name or assumed character. On his return to England after his voluntary exile and long wanderings, he had been informed b}' his solicitors that certain long-unproductive, almost forgotten shares belonging to his mother had, in a sudden turn of the speculative wheel, risen to unexpected fancy value ; he sold them and realized a capital which would enable him to live without resuming an occupation and a career in which he seemed to have lost for ever all interest. London, with its empty bustle and"], [94, "90 Doctor Greystone. grim, unrelenting activity, was intensely distasteful to him ; he felt more utterly an alien in its once familiar streets than on lonely peak or barren shore, and it was with a strange mixture of bitter satisfaction and ironical wonder that he saw himself unrecognised by some old chums he casually met in the street. He resolved to revisit his native county, and see once more the house over which his mother had held such long and gentle sway ; but when he entered the unforgot ten lane, and in front of him rose through the trees the dormer roof of the old homestead, he paused irresolute before the gates of the short drive that led to the house. He felt that he could not bear to have those sacred memories disturbed, to lose bis hold on the past of his happy childhood ; that it would give him acute pain to see a strange face and form appear at the open door where his mother used to meet him with out stretched hands and a smile of welcome. His fingers dropped from the latch, and he turned away. Where was he to go ? Where pitch his tent ? Where take up again the thread of his disrupted life? Unconsiously he asked himself these questions, as he paced the lonely platform of the little station, waiting for a train to carry him away from Calthrope. His eyes fell mechanically on the time-tables posted against the wall. The name of Syston seemed to stand out in the long list of towns and villages. It"], [95, "\" Mr. Stone\" 91 attracted his attention. A long obliterated picture rose into distinctness in his mind . . . Long ago, when he was a day scholar at the grammar school, and quite a little fellow, he had had an attack of scarlatina, and, after a tedious recovery, had been ordered rest from study and change of air. Instead of taking him to the sea side for a month, his mother had planned for him a rambling inland tour, the mere prospect of which had filled him with wild joy. In a desultory, happy fashion they had gone idly from place to place, selecting out-of-the-way spots and quaint old village inns. At Syston, they had spent a whole day and night at the \"Bull,\" detained indoors all the afternoon by a heavy thunderstorm; and reduced for amusement to the resources afforded by six antiquated copies of the \" Sunday at Home.\" Mrs. Greystone had read aloud to the boy, while he toasted bread for the early tea, before the fire in the Bull's parlour. They had chatted and laughed gaily over this meal, and little James had declared, when he went to bed in the late twilight, that he had never spent such a jolly day. Dr. Greystone remembered, as if he had seen them yesterday, the large buff arabesques on the brown paper of the inn's coffee room, the red moreen curtains, the stiff sofa with many and gaudy antimacassars, the bright steel fender and plate stand, before which he had knelt, the toasting fork hanging with dusty bellows and"], [96, "92 Doctor Greystone. elaborate kettle-holder on a nail in the chimney corner. He saw again the highly coloured painting over the mantel-shelf of an apocryphal St. Joseph presenting a lily to a mundane Bambino of mature years and scant attire ; several engravings, one of Wellington and Peel, in unsymmetrical juxtaposition, holding amicable converse in Babylonian halls; another of Rebecca and Rowena, and a large loyal print of Queen Victoria's coronation, all in mahogany frames protected against undisciplined flies by yellow tarlatan. Dr. Greystone smiled faintly as the lines of the picture one by one started into life, but the smile soon faded, and a suspicious dimness came to his eyes ; for out of the vulgar surroundings arose the vision of a woman still young, pale, with smooth bands of light brown hair, and tender eyes following him in his explorations around the parlour, and listening to his comments on the treasures of art it contained. The loud ringing of a hand bell by a hitherto unsuspected railway porter startled and roused him. When the train steamed alongside the platform, the solitary traveller who had been pacing it so long entered a carriage with a ticket for Syston, and two hours later was driven to the Bull with his battered portmanteau. That hostelry had altered little in the last twenty eight years. Wellington and Rowena still graced its walls not much the worse for wear, but some"], [97, "\" Mr. Stone.\" 93 modern improvements, due to the enterprising spirit of the new landlord, Mr. Home, had added to its comforts, and Dr. Greystone deter- mined to stop at least one night. He heard himself addressed a httle later as Mr. Stone, with a slight start of surprise, but an involuntary* explanatory glance of the boots at the portmanteau just brought into his bedroom gave him a cue to the error. Half the brass plate had been worn smooth by age and hard usage, and his name, having been originally engraved on it entirely in capitals, the mistake was excusable. He deemed it unnecessary to rectify* it ; it suited his morbid sensitiveness to sink his individuality* as far as he could do so without actual prevarication ; and perhaps the fact of being an absolute stranger in person as in name, as much as the quiet beauty of Syston, the influence of his boyish reminiscences, and the weariness of constant change prompted him to make a lengthened stay in the locality he revisited for the second time, but in such altered circumstance. He let Mr. Home negotiate the taking of Mrs. Ralph's rooms, and the landlord did so in the name of Mr. Stone. His rare corre- spondence on inevitable business matters was addressed to him at the post office, Leicester, and the cases containing his books bore only the hiero glyphics so dear to carriers and warehousemen. The identity of the once famous specialist was merged in the unobtrusive personality of the"], [98, "94 Doctor Greystone. silent, abstracted stranger, and it almost seemed to James Greystone as if he never had any wider horizon than those secluded country lanes, any lofty hopes, wide ambitions, or noble aims. The man who had bowed under the exacting tyranny of science, who in his ardent endeavours to solve her mysterious problems had absorbed himself in abstruse study, making humanity, whom he sought to benefit, secondary in his estimation, and placing the effects before the cause in his eager enthusiasm, had in one moment become almost indifferent to the vocation of his manhood. A rude and unexpected shock had broken into the exclusiveness in which he dwelt, and the cold, passionless teachings of science had been impotent to help him in that encounter with human passion and human frailty which he had met unarmed, out of which he had come disabled. He stood alone, doubtful of the all-healing power of the science he had loved, distrustful of hu manity that revealed itself to him only to wound ; unconsciously he turned to the soothing influence of nature, and fell under the tender charm of its quiet, subtle, silent attractions. He who had passed careless and unmoved by the most sublime and majestic scenes in both hemispheres found himself stealthily drawn out of his sombre melan choly by the unpretending beauties of a quiet nook in the heart of an English county. He became cognisant with a vague wonder of the ever-"], [99, "\" Mr. Stone.\" 95 shifting, ever-changing variety of the eternally monotonous year ; the tender grace of Spring, the opulence of Summer, April showers and July radiance, rippling waters under chequered sha dows, gossamer dews on trembling meadows, hushed sounds on moonlit nights ; he found himself unawares in sympathy with the dumb life throbbing around him in foliage, brooks, and hedgerows, and his past knowledge of botany and zoology elucidated for him many a hidden mystery or daily miracle. With Aristophanes he saw the birds, \"Brick layer or stonemason or carpenter \" ; in his long, rambling walks he grew strangely interested in the infinitesimally* small dramas enacted under cover of a blade of grass or revealed in a crypt laid open by a rolling pebble. In his long isolation from men, in his morbid solitude, James Greystone would have become a cynical misanthrope bad not earth and sky and water opened before him the broad unread pages of their illimitable lore. He soon came to read them fluently and to know the book by heart ; all its small tokens were familiar to him, and its landmarks recognisable. He knew that April was at hand, not so much by the return of the migratory birds, as by the modest labours of the earthworms throwing up their casts ; for him the martin heralded May, when with premature discretion it built a home for the young family to be born only in the warmth"], [100, "96 Doctor Greystone. of July and August. He watched the deserted rookery in Bradgate Woods, garrisoned during the winter only by four or five veteran birds, tenanted in the spring by the returning legions, who had to wage a noisy war against the indignant sentinels before they could occupy once more their abandoned quarters. When he saw the swallows hawking for flies, he could tell that rain was near, even had he not observed the ducks in the millpond trimming their feathers and throwing water over their backs to try if it would run off without wetting them; he followed the operations of \" The drakes, by Jove, with aprons tucked up, Bare bricks, and after them like serving lads Flew up with cement in their mouths, the swallows.\" James Greystone began to like bis home in the little cottage, his life at Syston, and had no thoughts of leaving it \u2014 he would wait at least until the kingfisher built his nest during the halcyon days \u2014 the shortest in the year, to which he gives his name. CHAPTER IV. MR. STONE MAKES A FRIEND DF THE KEEPER. The cases of fever that had broken out in the low-lying parts of Syston and at the paper mills were neither so isolated nor so confined to that locality as Carrie Maltby had confidently"], [101, "Mr. Stone makes a Friend of the Keeper. 97 declared bhsm to bo. In many a roadside cottage ci farm-house, as well as in the crowded tene ments of the factory hands, some shivering, haggard man, some hitherto plump baby lay helpless and in pain \u2014 the former struggling against the disease which, to the breadwinners, meant starvation in the homestead ; the latter, resistless and uncomplaining, after the fashion of all little children, who accept suffering as they accept joy, with the half-wondering, half-resigned passiveness that so pathetically tells of their inability to cope with either. The reputation that \"Mr. Stone,\" as he was now universally called, and as we shall call him also, had made for himself by his skilful and generous attendance on little Billy, after his accident, had the onerous disadvantages of popu larity. He was tacitly expected to renew the beneficial experiment, and whenever his steps carried him towards the infected district he was confronted by crying women, who, with their aprons to their eyes, waylaid him on the thres hold of their cottages, and who addressed him with the peculiarly aggressive sniffle of emotion common to the lower orders. \" Please, sir, you're such a clever and kind gentleman, might I make so bold, sir, as to ask you to step in one minute, just to tell me what must be done to my good man ? He's got the shakes dreadful since last night.\" Cr"], [102, "Doctor Greystone. 98 The \"kind gentleman\" would step in almost mechanically, and look round vaguely on the squalor and dirt ; then, when his eye fell on the sick-bed, his eye took a strange expression of power and observation, his listless manner dis appeared, and he more generally than not began by administering a sharp reproof. \" Open the window, my good woman, and don't shut that door ; make a draught, pull back that curtain, clear that mountain of petticoats and clothes off the bed, and let me see what's the matter.\" For the time being he was once more the physician, shrewd, prompt, energetic \u2014 the man of science, to whom the patient is nothing, the malady all. He gave his instructions briefly a^d decisively as to diet, cleanliness, and medicine ; supplemented them by sending what was required from his own house, and having the pre scription made up at his expense ; then he dis missed the whole matter from his thoughts, and became again the dreamer and the recluse. The immediate result of his ministration was that his irregular patients recovered in nine cases out of ten much quicker and more thoroughly than the legitimate clients of Dr. Leslie, who, while he was at heart not displeased at having so many unremunerative cases taken off his hands, was grievously offended at the eulogies showered on his amateur rival, and at the sudden confidence"], [103, "Mr. Stone makes a Friend of the Keeper. 99 he inspired. Dr. Leslie, although a good and honourable man, had a susceptible vanity, and, feeling sore on the subject, did not scruple to let off little sarcasms and sneers at the unconscious lodger of Mrs. Ralph, and at the ignorance of the lower orders, who fly to a quack with such unreasoning blindness. He was especially put out by the defection of John Churton, one of Sir Everett Barston's keepers, who lived in a cottage on the outskirts of a wood bounding Barston Park on. the north side, at some distance from the Hall. It came about in the following manner. Churton was an elderly man, whose life and his father's before him had been spent man and boy in the service of the Barstons ; he had met his first wife, seen his sons and daughters settled, mostly on the estate and in the neighbourhood, and then at fifty-five, finding the loneliness of his home intolerable, he had quietly married a pretty girl of nineteen, whom he had taken out of a farmhouse some twelve miles off, where she led the hard life of a poor, orphaned relation. She made the old man an excellent and loving wife , and, to his inexpressible joy, gave him a son, who was his Benjamin, the apple of his eye, the pride of his heart. The child, a sturdy little fellow of three, sickened suddenly. Miss Barston, who had a great liking for Churton and his young wife, came to the cottage daily, and begged Dr. Leslie to be unremitting in his care. However, the"], [104, "100 Doctor Greystone. child got rapidly worse, and one evening towards the end of June the Doctor left the cottage, saying to Miss Barston, who had hurried down from the Hall \u2014 \" I have done all in my power, Miss Barston, but in vain : there is no hope.\" \" There always is hope while there is life,\" said Ruth. \" Do not leave baby now, Dr. Leslie. Surely something can be tried.\" \" I fear not ; the little thing will not live through the night.\" Ruth shuddered. \" I can be of no earthly good here, and I have a serious case beyond Leicester. Good night ! \" \"Poor Jane Churton!\" said Ruth piteously. She had gone to the door with the doctor, and glanced back sorrowfully at the young mother, whom she could see in the inner room on her knees before the little cot, one arm stretched across the coverlet, and gazing with all her soul in her eyes at the pale, slightly contracted features of the child lying with closed eyelids in a state of coma. The doctor shrugged his shoulders, not un kindly, but with the philosophy of one who has seen death too often to look upon it as the tragedy which it is to those who wrestle with it for the life they hold most dear. He disappeared in the wood, and with a heavy heart Ruth re-entered the cottage. \"Oh, miss!\" said the young woman, \"what"], [105, "Mr. Stone makes a Friend of the Keeper. 101 did he say ? Baby is better, isn't he ? Look ! he is sleeping so quiet now.\" Ruth remained silent ; she had not the courage to dispel the mother's illusion \u2014 to say that from that sleep there would be no awakening. For a few moments no sound broke the stillness, and the soft murmur of the surrounding trees seemed to hush and soothe the watchers. Suddenly a quick, heavy step was heard on the strip of gravel, the door was pushed open, and Churton appeared on the threshold, white under the sunburn of his cheeks, staggering and with trembling outstretched hands. Instinctively Ruth moved towards him. He waved her aside, not roughly, but scarcely heeding who she was, and stood erect at the foot of the table. \" Dead ! \" he muttered, almost inaudibly ; and his eyes became glazed with slow, welling tears. \" Dead ! My little one dead ! \" The mother started to her feet at the thrice repeated word. She stared wildly at her husband. \" No \u2014 no ! Not dead, John ! Don't say that ! \" she cried excitedly. \" Baby sleeps ; he is \u2014 better ! \" But her voice faltered over the hopeful word \u2014 a sickening fear silenced her. \"He will never be better, Jane,\" moaned the keeper. \" I met the doctor just now and he told me that the boy was \" He broke down entirely, and turning to the wall leaned against it with his head on his arm."], [106, "102 Doctor Greystone-. The mother's hands fell rigid in front of her. She stood pallid and mute ; then, clutching Ruth's dress with a feeble, trembling hand, she gasped. \" Is it \u2014 is it \u2014 true, miss ? \" The tears standing in Ruth's eyes only con firmed the anguish of her heart, which had already answered her question. She dropped down on her knees before the cot with a long despairing cry that rang through the open door far into the twilight stillness of the woods. \"Pardon me,\" said a quiet, composed voice on the threshold, \" I heard a scream. I feared some accident had happened. May I be of any use ? \" \"Mr. Stone, I believe?\" said Miss Barston, with a slight inclination of her head. \" Yes,\" answered he, barely acknowledging the salutation. His practised eye had grasped the whole scene, and was already fastened on the dying child. The keeper turned round, half angrily, at the intrusion, but when he recognised the new-comer his face changed, a faint ray of hope illumined his despairing face, and he said hurriedly, brokenly, almost peremptorily \u2014 \" You're the one who got the Milwards' baby, at the Ferry, through the fever \u2014 and who set old Raggett straight in no time \u2014 you're clever \u2014 worth two of Dr. Leslie \u2014 oh, sir ! can't you save my boy?\" Mr. Stone had already bent over the little"], [107, "Mr. Stone makes a Friend of the Keeper. 103 sufferer, lifted the heavy lids, felt the feeble pulse, laid his ear to the panting breast ; he hastily tore a leaf from his pocket-book, wrote a few words, and handed it to the keeper. \" Run to the chemist's, get this made up, and bring it back at once ; every minute is precious ! \" Without a word Churton started off, and the echo of his running steps died away in the gather ing gloom. \" Get some boiling water,\" this to the mother ; then turning to Ruth, and answering her ques tioning eyes : \"The child may pull through \u2014 mind you, I say may \u2014 if the father is back within twenty minutes.\" Churton returned in the given time, and his little son did not die. From that day there lived in Syston a man who would gladly, at any time, lay down his life for Mr. Stone, and that man was John Churton, Sir Everett Barston's keeper. The child, however, was not returned to health all at once, and Mr. Stone met Miss Barston several times at the cottage after that first even ing, when the gravity of the occurrence had been sufficient reason for the absence of ceremony* and formal introduction. Ruth, always quiet, gentle, and gracefully reserved, talked pleasantly in her pretty, prim, and yet unsophisticated manner to her new acquaintance. A gentlewoman, with all a gentlewoman's instincts, she recognised the gentlemanliness of Mr. Stone, and easily drifted"], [108, "104 Doctor Greystone. into an intercourse during which many subjects were broached incidentally, not having a direct reference to the little patient. Ruth was well informed without pedantry, and, removed from the chilling influence of her father's sardonic super ciliousness, she could talk with great charm ; never pretending to brilliancy or effect, she was earnest enough to judge soundly, to observe with intelligence, and to express herself with the un conventionality and unconscious imagery that belong to those who live much with their own thoughts. Mr. Stone would have found it difficult to say if Ruth was handsome, what was the colour of her hair and eyes, and her exact age ; he only knew that her voice was low and grave, her smile rare and sweet; that she was a refined, quiet woman who moved easily and softly, whose white hands were alike capable and tender as she minis tered to the sick child during its mother's ab sence, and that \" if there were more such nurses our hospitals would fare better ; nurses in name, sisters of mercy in deed.\" Miss Barston, on her side, vaguely considered Mr. Stone as an agreeable acquisition to the neighbourhood, and supposed that Sir Everett would in time call upon him, and, if he liked him, make him welcome to the hall. She had naturally reported the illness and recovery of Churton 's boy to her father, and given the new-comer the"], [109, "Barston Hall. 105 credit of saving a patient condemned by Dr. Leslie. Sir Everett had lent to her words the careless attention he generally vouchsafed to his daughter's communications, and volunteered no further remark. Young Bertie, the only son of the house, had suggested a call on Mrs. Ralph's lodger, alleging that he understood him to be \" a swell on birds and fish generally,\" to which Sir Everett had replied : \" Plenty of time for that, my dear boy, plenty of time. Let us first ascertain who the fellow is, and if he means to settle down here. I cannot be expected to call upon every outsider who pitches his tent in my vicinity for a couple of months or so.\" There the matter had rested, and Ruth had felt no impatience or concern respecting a closer inti macy with her chance acquaintance. CHAPTER V. BARSTON HALL. Barston Hall was a large, roomy, somewhat gloomy Elizabethan mansion, which bad for many generations been in the possession of the Barston family, whose baronetcy dated a long way back. The property was of sufficient extent and importance to give the owner the squireship of Syston, and to make him the most influential member of that small community."], [110, "Doctor Greystotte. 106 Sir Everett, the present baronet, had come to the title when quite a boy. A constitutional delicacy, an unusually ailing childhood, had pre maturely aged him, and he became a man with out ever having been a youth. Unable to cope with the rough treatment of public schools, he had been educated at home by private tutors ; incapacitated by ill health from most of the sports of boyhood, his mind had acquired an unusual development. He had taken up learning not only as a distraction, but as a means of satis fying his ambition, and acquiring the supremacy which he had no hope of obtaining by physical achievements. Having been from his birth an object of paramount importance in his own circle, he had early, and perhaps pardonably, conceived the highest possible opinion of himself, justified in a measure as years rolled on by his really re markable intelligence, application, and knowledge. The precautions that surrounded him, the enforced abstention from the society of young men of his age, fostered his self-contemplation, and when at twenty-two he unexpectedly acquired strength and comparative immunity from suffering and invalidism, his character was already formed, and his whole nature biassed. He made an effort to mix into society \u2014 went to London, became member of several clubs, visited the theatres, travelled abroad, and met on all sides the welcome and encouragement which"], [111, "Barston Halt. 107 the world is prone to tender to a young, hand some, rich, titled, and eligible man. During that brief period of natural youthfulness, he married. He had always intended to do so at one time or another, and, when he met a girl whose passionate love for himself even he could not doubt, he found it easy and pleasant to make her his wife, and to let her fancy in her fond infatuation that her affection was returned. The union of two people, both young, both handsome, both attached to each other, had every guarantee of happiness. But the honey moon was barely over, when Sir Everett tired, not only of the world, but of the obligations of his new estate, and carried his young wife back to the Hall, not to leave it again. Lady Barston would gladly have shut herself up in even a more sombre retreat than the Leicestershire family mansion with the man she adored, had Sir Everett been willing to play his part in that solitude a deux so bewitching to lovers. Un fortunately he estranged himself more and more from her society, and returned with increased fervour to the beloved books and studies he had reluctantly forsaken. In vain the poor young wife studied all bis wishes, forestalled his desires, complied with his tastes, condemned herself to companionless seclusion; she rarely won from him a caress or a tender word ; he accepted her devotion with a calm unconcern more galling"], [112, "108 Doctor Greystone. than unkindness, and returned her warm, ex pansive, overflowing love with a cool, courteous politeness more chilling than active dislike. She could not reproach him with neglect or in fidelity, she would have surprised him much had she complained of the cruel change in his manner since the day he wooed and won her; and he would probably* have marvelled greatly at woman's injustice and exaction. But she felt with a keen, insupportable pain, that she, and the little daughter born to them, were as nought in the eyes of the husband and father. Indeed, the child, by the error of her sex, had been a disappointment to Sir Everett, one he had not attempted to conceal, and which seemed to make the baby girl obnoxious to him. It was not long before little Ruth was the only living token of Blanche Barston's passage in her husband's sombre home. When all light and hope had faded out of her path, when she lost the desire to live her unloved life, she pined, and faded and died, before any one around her had noticed that she was ailing. She died as she had lived, making no sign, no murmur, faithful and loyal to the last in the dreary starvation of her heart. Sir Everett could not help missing the gentle wife who so patiently* and thoughtfully ministered to his comfort, and smoothed with instinctive forethought any asperity on his way. A singular irritation and discontent was the outward mani-"], [113, "Barston Hall. 109 festation of his mourning, and be seemed to make bis little daughter responsible for her mother's loss ; it pleased him to believe that the birth of the child had sapped Blanche's health, and indirectly caused her death. He became more stern, more cynical, more self-engrossed than of yore, and delegated his paternal duties to nurses and governesses, disclaiming any interference in the education and bringing up of the child. Ruth fell into good hands. She met with kindness and intelligent care ; and if her child hood was neither a mirthful hor a joyous one, if her mouth rarely parted in laughter, if her small feet trod the rooms with too sedate a step, and her eyes were full of a gravity beyond her years, yet she was not unhappy, and grew up into a calm, reserved, soft-voiced, gentle, serene young girl. When she was about five years old, Sir Everett was taken with a sudden fit of restless ness, caused probably by a return of the consti tutional debility of which he was not absolutely cured. He abruptly left the Hall, and, as was his wont, deemed it unnecessary to give any clue to his intentions and whereabouts. Six months later the establishment was startled by a written injunction from the squire to have every thing in readiness to receive not only him, but Lady Barston. Before the surprise of this"], [114, "110 Doctor Greystone. announcement was over, the newly wedded couple arrived, and the wonderment did not abate, for the bride was, a beautiful, dashing, brilliant, haughtily careless woman of the world, who from the first hour set at naught her husband's prejudices and filled the Hall with guests and visitors. It was never quite known under what thraldom he had fallen and how he had been led into an alliance so foreign to his tastes, so incompatible with his habits. From his impassible demeanour it was not easy to gather whether or not he repented his rash ven- ture. Only occasionally a glitter of his eye, as he followed the laughing, graceful woman wandering from group to group ; an added sternness in the curves of his mouth, a line in his broad forehead might have betrayed to an acute observer that he felt any interest in the actions of the mistress of his home. Was that interest love, jealousy, or anger ? Sir Everett kept his secret. Lady Barston, by the sheer force of her daring carelessness and unconscious indifference to her husband, compelled him not only to tolerate the revels over which she presided, but to countenance them by his presence, and he moved among the guests a pale, slender, courteous host, invariably polite, but never demonstrative. The reign of the second Lady Barston was not much longer than that of her predecessor ; before Sir Everett had been married two years he was"], [115, "Barston Hall. 111 once more a widower ; the brilliant, triumphant woman died in the first flush of the successful marriage which had brought her the rank and wealth she alone coveted, leaving, however, an heir to the Baronetcy. By a strange contradiction, by one of those mysterious twistings of the human heart that defy analysis, Sir Everett had never felt one throb of natural affection for the child of the only woman who had ever awakened a tender feeling in his bosom, and who had loved him with such blind, passionate adoration, but he showed more than a father's tenderness for the son of the worldly beauty who had treated him with tantalizing, careless indifference. Bertie was bis idol ; the only warm corner of his heart was touched by the boy, who as he grew up enjoyed at his hands the indulgence, latitude, and liberty which he refused to all others. At the time this story opens, Sir Everett was a handsome spare man of fifty-two, with whiten ing hair, a narrow pale face, and aristocratic carriage. The Hall had for many years resumed the formal precision of its earlier days ; the Baronet did his duty to the neighbourhood within the narrowest limits, as his fathers had done before him, nothing more. Ruth was nominally at the head of his establishment, as became Miss Barston, but it was a purely nominal position, which the girl filled with the quiet, retiring grace of her nature. Hers was a- thankless part in that"], [116, "112 Doctor Greystone. household ; as her poor young mother had done, she gave tenderness, devotion and affection in ex change for a perfunctory courtesy which she saw more liberally tendered to strangers. White and silent, she recalled those pure medi\u00e6val figures of maidens with clasped hands and clinging garments, standing at the doors of chapels or the gates of feudal keeps, listening to tales of misery and woe, dispensing alms and soft words, their only vocation on earth \u2014 charity, asking and getting no return. CHAPTER VI. THE GARDEN PARTY AT MILE END VILLA. The illness and recovery of the keeper's child had occurred about a month before the Maltbys' garden party ; for the last fortnight there had been no occasion for either of its two kind friends to return to the cottage, so Mr. Stone and Miss Barston had naturally discontinued their visits. The Doctor had not, from the first, entertained the remotest idea of accepting Carrie Maltby 's offhand invitation given at the bookstall of the station and had forgotten all about it, when he received a reminder in the shape of a printed card requesting his presence, and holding forth the twin attractions of tennis and music. It occurred to him that Miss Barston had once casually asked him if he had made the acquaintance of the Maltbys, mentioning that she thought highly of"], [117, "The Garden Party at Mile End Villa. 113 one os the daughters. Unconsciously missing the pleasant intercourse with the gentle girl, to which he had grown accustomed during the child's convalescence, he vaguely wondered if she might possibly go to the garden party, and, somewhat to his own astonishment, he found himself entering the gates of Mile End Villa at five o'clock on the afternoon of the Wednesday which had been looked forward to with such proud anticipations by the entire Maltby establishment. Mr. Maltby had been persuaded, or rather commanded, by his Barbara to remain at home, and had moreover vouched for the appearance of a certain number of his hunting field acquaint ances and their families, to be chosen with nice discrimination. \" Now, Fred,\" had urged Mrs. Maltby, \" don't bring here any farmers or any of your low friends ; it would just ruin us with Mrs. Turner, who is so very careful about the people with whom that precious daughter of hers associates. She has already more than hinted that we were not half particular enough with our girls \u2014 and then Sir Everett and Miss Barston \" \" If they come,\" answered Mr. Maltby. How ever, he dutifully followed bis wife's instructions, and mortally offended half-a-dozen hearty Nimrods who had reckoned upon taking their female belongings to Mile End Villa on the fifth of July."], [118, "114 Doctor Greystone. Several young men, more or less connected with the London firm from which Mr. Maltby had seceded, had come down for the occasion, and were \" put up\" at the Villa ; likewise a batch of young ladies, whilom school friends from London, and relatives from the North, who, like the Maltby girls, found it most enjoyable to be crowded into small bedrooms where they could chat and giggle into the small hours of the night. They were, as a rule, good natured, honest, red-cheeked, shrill voiced hobbledy-hoy girls, fond of romping, of horseplay, of practical jokes, of chaff, of young men, of dancing, tennis, and, indeed, of any and everything on which they could vent the exuber ance of their animal spirits ; girls that in their own circles are called \" so jolly and unaffected,\" in others, \" so fast and so loud \" ; girls that would, as likely as not, tame down into practical, common-place, sensible wives and mothers ; girls in their present stage utterly abhorrent to such men as James Greystone and Sir Everett, and absolutely uncongenial to such women as Ruth Barston. Tennis with a running accompaniment of piercing cries, obtained in three courts in front of the house, glees were at intervals sung by hidden minstrels under a drooping schumac tree; a tent, hired for the day with the waiters, afforded shelter to the refreshment tables; rustic seats accommodated elderly ladies when they did not"], [119, "The Garden Party at Mite End Villa, 115 prefer the safer shade and coolness of the drawing room ; gentlemen, very* much in the minority, at least those who did not sport the \"whites,\" wandered in and out of the tent and the house, reluctantly and awkwardly pressed into the service of Miss Maltby and Sally, to carry cups of tea or plates of strawberries and cream to those who avoided the crush of the refreshment tables. \" There he comes,\" whispered Sally, nudging her sister Carrie, as she passed by her on the lawn. \" You had better go to him ; he is your friend, and I am sure I am not going to take charge of him.\" \" He ! who ? where ? \" said Carrie, uncere moniously turning away from a sleek youth of no conversational powers, whom she had reduced to open-mouthed fascination by her rattling talk. Sally, before departing with a jug of iced champagne-cup, slowly shook her head in the direction of a belt of laurels, which screened the grounds from the road, and from which Mr. Stone was emerging with the slightly-puzzled frown of a reserved man suddenly finding himself on a social terra incognita. \" Oh, Mr. Stone ! \" said Carry. \" Well, I never thought he would turn up; He looks now as if he wanted to turn tail and fly. I must lay hold of him at once.\" She darted away from the sleek young man,"], [120, "116 Doctor Greystone. whom Sally good-naturedly took in tow and conveyed to the tennis ground, and rushed up to her special guest with outstretched hand. \" So glad to see you, Mr. Stone ; isn't it a glorious day ? \" Then, without waiting for an answer, she continued, \"Do you play tennis ? \u2014 No? Well,- so much the better, as the sets are made up. Have some tea ? \u2014 an ice? \u2014 a glass of wine ? \u2014 -anything ? \u2014 or shall I introduce you to mother ? ' ' \" By all means, Miss Maltby. I have been looking for Mrs. Maltby, in order to thank her for her invitation,\" said Mr. Stone, wondering more and more what had brought him there. \"Oh! there's mother, coming this way \u2014 just over there \u2014 come along,\" and Carrie moved towards a lady whom the Doctor thought the most appalling woman he had ever met. Mrs. Maltby wore the richest, stiffest, and best-made gown ; a glittering ripple of chatelaine and spectacle-case flowed from her waist, heavy gold chains and ornaments shone at her neck and wrists, a cap of exquisite lace and brillant ribbons surmounted her grey hair, the muslin lappets fastened with jewelled pins under her chin; she looked proud, prosperous, and imperturbable as she sailed across the lawn to join them. She was in her element, on hospitable cares intent, satisfied with her home, her daughters, her husband, her management, the real excellence of"], [121, "The Garden Party at Mile End Villa. 117 her plate, china and edibles, and the number of her guests. \"Mother,\" said Carrie, \"this is Mr. Stone, a new-comer to Syston, and, as you know, a neigh bour of ours.\" Mrs. Maltby extended a hand, which close and personal attendance to domestic matters had rendered somewhat coarse and discoloured ; but nothing could be heartier than her voice and welcome. \" And a great shame too, Mr. Stone, that, being our neighbour, we have not met before. Now the ice is broken, you must make yourself quite at home at Mile End Villa.\" Mr. Stone bowed. \"Everybody does it, and that is the advantage of a large family ; we do not stand on ceremony. The girls will cheer you up.\" \"Perhaps Mr. Stone does not want to be cheered,\" said Carry, expecting the usual dis claimer, which, however, did not come. Mrs. Maltby resumed : \"If reports are true, he requires it more than anyone. It is bad for a man to live too much alone.\" \"I am used to that,\" quietly answered the Doctor. \" Well, the sooner you mend your ways the better. Books are very well in their way, Mr. Stone, but sociability is better for all of us. Do you really find Mrs, Ralph's cottage pretty com fortable?\""], [122, "Doctor Greystone. 118 \" Quite so ; she is a pattern landlady* \u2014 she is not over-officious.\" \" And keeps her place clean, does she? \" \" I should say so.\" \" Bachelors are so careless about those matters, they are dreadfully imposed upon ; every evil advantage taken of them. Well, Mr. Stone, if we can do anything for you, send you anything from the Ahlla to make you more comfortable, just mention it ; I shall be most happy.\" \" You are very kind, Mrs. Maltby, but I assure you Mrs. Ralph's accommodation is all I require,\" said Mr. Stone, with some decision. These offers of service from a perfect stranger seemed to him almost impertinent. He could not be aware how Mile End Villa had decided that he should not long continue a stranger. \" So much the better, so much the better. But if you had consulted me I could have recom mended far superior lodgings, nearer the station. Gentlemen are always running to town, and find that a great convenience.\" \"I seldom go to town,\" said Mr. Stone, in so uncompromising a tone that Mrs. Maltby, a little nonplussed, turned to her daughter. \" Carrie, where is your father ? He would like to know that Mr. Stone is here.\" \"Father is down at the stables with those fat men from Leicester,\" answered Carrie, who, con sidering Mr, Stone as her own charge, held herself"], [123, "The Garden Party at Mile End Villa. 119 responsible for his amusement. \" Do you want to look at the horses, Mr. Stone?\" she asked dubiously. \" I am very happy here, Miss Maltby,\" he answered, quite as desirous as Carrie to avoid the suggested visit to the distant stables. A quick reconnoitring glance around and strategical survey of the premises had told him that his meditated escape would better be effectuated from where he stood. Carrie smiled approvingly, and as Jessie came within range favoured her, behind Mr. Stone's back, with a facial distortion of countenance expressive of triumph. \"Do you know anyone here?\" she asked, turn. ing to him again. \" No \u2014 no,\" looking vaguely before him \" Then come with me. I'll introduce you to such a jolly girl.\" \" Pray do not concern yourself about me, Miss Maltby.\" Carrie, tried to construe this speech into an implied desire to enjoy her society undisturbed, but found it difficult. \" Why ! I declare if that is not Sir Everett and Miss Barston,\" suddenly exclaimed Mrs. Maltby, adjusting her golden eyeglass on her Roman nose, and in a voice of such exultation that it betrayed not only how the arrival gratified her, but how unhoped for it had really been. \" Carrie, run"], [124, "120 Doctor Greystone. and call your father from those everlasting stables. I beg your pardon, Mr. Stone, but I must leave you for the present. Sir Everett is our big man about here,\" and with a conscious air she de parted to greet with her best company smile the spare, pallid, white-haired baronet who was slowly advancing with his daughter on his arm. Miss Barston, in a simple, quiet costume of soft grey stuff, looked like her father, strangely high-bred, and colourless in the midst of the gaudy scene they entered. \" Ruth Barston is an awfully nice girl, Mr. Stone,\" said Carrie, in no hurry to obey her mother's bequest. \" The old gentleman, however, is an awful muff,\" she continued with her habitual disregard of the elegancies of language. \" He looks like a tallow candle in a draught, doesn't he?\" Mr. Stone smiled. \" I think he looks like a gentleman.\" \" Oh,\" said Carrie, pursing up her mouth. \"Have I put my foot in it ? Is he a friend of yours?\" \" Not at all. It is the first time I have seen him.\" \"Anyhow,\" resumed Carrie, \"you ought to know Miss Barston. She is not half as stuck up as she looks.\" \" I do know Miss Barston,\" quietly rephed the Doctor."], [125, "The Garden Party at Mile End Villa. 121 \" Well, I never ! That's luck ! Did you meet her before coming to Syston? \" \" No, I made her acquaintance here by accident a few week3 since.\" \"She is all right, but Sir Everett is awfully difficult to get on with, I believe.\" Carrie dealt in superlatives of a slangy nature. \" He just terrifies me. When I am anywhere with him I always feel tempted to pin a label to his coat, ' Visitors are requested not to touch,' and I am not sure I shall not do it some day.\" Mr. Stone winced, but was spared a reply, for Ruth Barston at this juncture came up and shook hands with Carrje, the only one of the Maltby girls she liked, having divined how much warmth of heart underlaid the scatter-brained talk and loud manner. Mr. Stone bowed, and Ruth's face as she became aware of his presence lit up with one of her rare sweet smiles. \"Coaxed out of your den, Mr. Stone?\" she said, \"and on pleasure bent? I thought I was never to see you save on some errand of mercy and charity. Papa,\" she continued, turning to Sir Everett, who, having shaken off Mrs. Maltby, was lounging on, \" papa, let me introduce Mr. Stone. You remember \u2014 the gentleman who saved the life of Churton's little boy ? \" Sir Everett looked observantly at the man his daughter introduced to him. Of course he had known the bare facts concerning the illness at the"], [126, "122 Doctor Greystone. keeper's cottage \u2014 the successful intervention of a stranger when Dr. Leslie had given up the child, and its subsequent recovery ; but, barring that, as he rarely conversed with bis daughter, and never asked her opinion of any human being, he had, in a careless, indifferent fashion, formed his own about the stranger, or as much of one as he deemed it worth while to give to so unimportant a subject. \" Some sort of quack or country Dulcamara ! It occasionally happens that these ignorant and itinerant practitioners are credited with miraculous cures,\" he had said, and dis missed the matter. The Baronet now found himself confronted with an unmistakable gentleman ; no mean judge of character, be noted the thoughtful brow, the deep passionless eyes, the firm, sad mouth, the grey hair at the temples, the well-shapen hands \u2014 above all, the ease and unconsciousness of the well-knit figure. The haughty indifference of his manner relaxed. James Greystone probably noticed the subse quent modification as little as the previous half contemptuous coldness, for he allowed himself to be led into the preliminary stages of conversation with absolute carelessness, slightly relieved, how ever, at the interruption of his desultory talk with Carrie, who, seeing the two men occupied with each other, had strolled off with Ruth. Sonie casual remark of Sir Everett's on thg"], [127, "The Garden Party at Mile End Villa. 123 possible origin of the fever at Syston brought forth one of James Greystone's pregnant, com prehensive, and decisive statements. Leaving commonplaces aside, the conversation ran into a deeper and less superficial channel, and the inter locutors, without knowing it, became interested in each other. Both were erudite and well read ; both were fond of books ; both had travelled and studied mankind. On these grounds they had much in common ; on every other they were dissimilar. James Greystone's views were wide ; for him science was essentially philanthropical, and to fulfil its aim must be beneficial to humanity. His own knowledge and experience were at the service of all, and practice was the natural sequence of theory. Sir Everett had read, studied, and travelled for self-gratification only ; his well-stocked library and rare editions were for his own use solely ; his reserve and exclusive ness came from an unwillingness to acknowledge the claims of others on his time and considera tion \u2014 the one was self-contemplation, the other selfishness. His indifference to his daughter's tastes, pursuits, happiness, and pleasures sprang from a constitutional inability fostered by indul gence, to feel or show interest or show partici pation in any event not concerning himself, or of which he was not the central figure. He was too genuinely high-bred not t-o have perfect"], [128, "124 Doctor Greystone. manners ; too genuinely self-absorbed to place himself in situations where the courtesy be would not withhold should become irksome. In society he preferred the company of women who flattered him, and to whom he tacitly conveyed the im pression that he was a chivalrous admirer of the fair sex. In bis own house be preferred men, because they did not have the same claims on his time and politeness that ladies would, and because be could always withdraw himself from their company on a plausible pretext. Gifted, clever, a fluent and elegant talker, be expected, and generally obtained, undivided attention for any subject it pleased him to discuss or descant upon. When other topics not originating with him were on the tapis, he either waived them with supercilious indifference or ignored them by au assumption of abstraction or ill-concealed ennui. He said openly, and in a measure persuaded himself, that he deemed it an impertinent intrusion for any human being lo concern him self with the actions and findings of bis fellow creatures, except in so far as those actions and feelings bore any direct reference to himself, This cynical and superficial discretion was fully understood by the inmates of his bouse, however much it might impose upon outsiders, and the vaunted independence it was supposed to give them only went so far that it never clashed V. itb Sir Everett's habits, opinions, or tastes, for"], [129, "The Garden Party at Mile End Villa. 125 which he claimed constant sympathy and sub servience. A contrary course would promptly be met by sharp rebuke and cutting sarcasm. Too intelligent to be conceited, be bad the supreme and unconscious vanity that prompted him to win golden opinions, and urged him to successful efforts in public in order to command them. He was one of those men whom the world calls \u2014 and justly, according to its lights and experience \u2014 fascinating, aristocratic, courteous, and sweet-tempered. His daughter had fre- _t quently been told, \" Oh, Miss Barston, how charming your life must be at the Hall with such a delightful and indulgent father as Sir Everett ! You can never be dull.\" The Baronet deceived himself almost as much as he deceived others. It would have surprised him greatly if he had been told that under the veneer of his knightly manner, behind .the mask of bis high-bred courtliness, he was a cynical egotist, self-engrossed, callous to all sufferings and joys not bis own, and as contemptuous of humanity as an Indian fakhir. There was, however, one vulnerable spot in the armour of indifference in which his heart was cased : he loved his only son with blind partiality, That love, the strength of which the Baronet himself ignored, was born not so much of the natural tenderness of a father, as of pride in the heir of his race and name, the sole descendant of"], [130, "126 Doctor Greystone. a family great in his eyes because he was its head, and of a complex feeling, half regret and half remorse. One of the anomalies of his character was the singular relationship in which he stood towards his two children. The daughter born to him of the first woman be had loved, who had left for him a happy home only to wither and die in the chill atmosphere of the Hall, was as far apart from him as if she had not been child of his flesh. The son of the careless, imperious, frivolous Lady Everett, his second choice, wedded in an hour of ennui, to whom he had given no love and from whom he expected none, was as pre cious and dear as if he had been the offspring of a passionate attachment, of a life-long devotion. Bertie was his mother's son. Free, bold, dauntless, light-hearted, with no sensitiveness to wound, no tenderness to hurt, withal honest and upright, he filled at the Hall very much the place left vacant at Lady Everett's death, an open handed, easy-going young master, unobservant of any domestic dramas enacted under his eyes. At eighteen he was perfectly undaunted by his father, whom he loved after a careless boyish fashion, genuinely but undemonstratively attached to his sister, but preferring to either his horses, dogs, fishing-rods, and guns. Circumstances, or perhaps the gentle influence of Ruth, might yet mould that undeveloped nature. Bertie had in himself the making of a fine generous man, or of a ne'er-do-"], [131, "The Spider and the Fly. 127 well, but such as he was he remained the Maire du Palais of the Hall over which Sir Everett reigned, apparently the most dictatorial of faineant kings, and where Ruth Barston lived an almost conventual existence of humility and abnegation. CHAPTER Vn. THE SPIDER AND THE FLY. Before Mr. Maltby could be torn away from his stables and his horsey friends, Sir Everett had made much progress with Mr. Stone, and found him so congenial, that he had condescended to ask him to the Hall on the following day, in order to give him his opinion anent a disputed passage in a remarkable psychological French book he possessed, bearing upon their argument. The Baronet had two hobbies, metaphysics and trans cendental medicine ; to find a listener or an adver sary worthy of him constituted an enjoyment as keen as it was rare in the centre in which he lived. Mr. Stone expressed his thanks for the invitation without committing himself to an acceptance, which, however, was taken for granted. No one ever declined the finger of good-fellow ship when it pleased Sir Everett to extend it, ever so frigidly, and on this occasion the graceful act had been done with an unusual empressement. While the strangely assorted pair were still"], [132, "128 Doctor Greystone. apparently* well satisfied with each other's com pany, Mr. Maltby appeared, moving briskly towards them. \" Here comes our host, Mr. Stone,\" said the Baronet in his languidly cold voice \u2014 \" a signal for me to retire, as soon as I have exchanged the compliments d'usage. Beyond a passing acquaint ance at the meets, I have little in common with Mr. Maltby, who is a great hunter before the Lord. I have done my duty as a neighbour in putting in an appearance at his little gathering, and can now withdraw with a clear conscience.\" Then to Mr. Maltby, who came up rubbing his bands, tall, clean-shaven, manly, handsome, but ill at ease \u2014 \" It must be good-day and good-bye, my dear Maltby. I have only time to congratulate you on your charming party. Delightful after noon ! May I trouble you to send for Miss Barston ; she must have forgotten the hour,\" and the Baronet raised his single gold eye-glass and surveyed the lawn, evading the recognition of many eager eyes. \" You cannot think of going, Sir Everett, with out a glass of sherry or champagne,\" said Mr. Maltby with concerned hospitality. \" My wife would never forgive me for allowing it \u2014 it is quite impossible.\" \"Impossible, certainly, my dear Maltby, where the inducements to stay are so potent \u2014 but I regret to say inevitable. Ah, here comes Miss"], [133, "The Spider and the Fly. 129 Barston with one of your charming daughters. Ruth, my dear, we must tear ourselves away\u2014 the horses, I fear, are getting restless.\" Carrie nudged Ruth, and whispered to her. She smiled, and, somewhat hesitatingly, addressed her father : \" Carrie wishes us to stop and hear the singing, which is about to begin. Can we not manage to stop a little longer, papa ? It would please Mrs. Maltby.\" \" If Miss Maltby herself was to favour us with a song, I should not hesitate,\" said the Baronet, bowing to Carrie in his most fascinating manner, being perfectly aware that the girl did not know Yankee Doodle from a dirge. \"But, as we are not to be so honoured, let us slip away quietly and not interfere with the concert.\" The Maltbys protested, with that loud im pressiveness so disturbing to the person whom it is intended to coerce, but none better than Ruth knew what adamantine will was gloved in her father's velvety suavity of manner and speech. She silently shook hands with Carrie, who stood angry and discomfited, whispering that she would soon come and see her friend ; then addressing a few Words to Mr. Stone, took her father's proferred arm, and walked between the two gentlemen to the gates of the villa. Mr. Maltby was unable to conceal his chagrin, not that the abrupt departure caused him any personal disappointment, but he I"], [134, "130 Doctor Greystone': felt that he would be made to bear the responsi bility of it. \" And he carries off our other big card into the bargain,\" said he, pursing up his lips into the low whistle he affected on doubtful occasions, and glancing with a half-comic look at his daughter. \" I call it shabby and awfully mean,\" exclaimed Carrie, whose denunciations were always terse, as she returned to her friends. Mr. Maltby's apprehensions were fully justified. Had he been the Baronet's keeper, he could not have been more severely reproved for allowing him out his sight. \" I have not patience with Fred,\" said Barbara, when she found her guest had gone. \" It is just like him \u2014 he thinks of nothing but those blessed horses. Why did he not bring Sir Everett to the tent ? Why didn't he do something with him, anything? I can't be in a dozen places at the same time. What will Mrs. Turner say? The Barstons spend hours at her house. As it is, I doubt if half-a-dozen people know they really were here.\" \" Mr. Stone does, at all events,\" said Carrie, spitefully. \" The great Mogul talked with nobody but him.\" \"Oh! did he?\" said Mrs. Maltby, strangely mollified by that information. \" So we were all right in asking Mr. Stone, after all. Depend upon"], [135, "The Spider and the Fly. 131 it, he is worth knowing. Mrs. Turner told me that if the truth came out we should find out that he is quite in the swim. She means to ask him to dinner, but I shall be first \u2014 where is he ? \" Mr. Stone had vanished. Sally had, it is true, caught a glimpse of him near the tent, and Jessie, whose eyes were wide open, declared that Mrs. Turner had waylaid him in the shrubbery, and, as she expressed it, addressed him in her \" Bless you, my children,\" manner ; after which he had been lost to sight, and had probably followed the Baronet's lead, and, unobserved, left the scene of the revels. Later in the evening, in the easy familiarity -and freedom of the dressing-rooms, Carrie, who always had an admiring audience of friends during the process of hair-brushing, declared with much spirit and great decision that her stranger was \"no go.\" \" If I could have guessed what a solemn old extinguisher he would turn out, I shouldn't have chased him as I did, and got him for you all. And, just as I think him a regular sell, Mother takes it into her head that he is an awful swell, and means to have him about the house like a tame cat.\" \" By what I saw of him,\" said Sally, sleepily, \" it will be a tame Tartar, if tame at all.\" \" You should have heard Mother and poor dear Mrs. Turner talk him over. Mrs. Turner is posi tive he is a Warwickshire Stone, unless he is a"], [136, "132 Doctor Greystone. Lancashire Stone. I am sick of him already.

Honour among thieves. I never interfered with your Stone.\" \" Rolling stone gathers no Miss,\" laughed Carrie, whose perversion of proverbs was too well known in her circle to excite comment. \" W Tiat on earth did Sir Everett see in him? \" said Jessie. \" That he is not one of us \u2014 a great recom mendation in his eyes,\" satirically remarked another girl. ,: Such a duffer.\" \" Not at all,\" interposed Carrie, who wished to keep the monopoly of abuse in her own hands, and who, having been quizzed about her supposed conquest, would not submit to listen to ridicule from others. \"Ruth Barston told me that Mr. Stone was quite beyond the average of men in intellect and information.\" Shouts of derision received this statement. \" Oh, what a Barstonian speech!\" cried Jessie, \"gathered, cut and dried, from Sir Everett's prim lips. Poor Ruth, she will soon be as old-maidish as her father.\""], [137, "The Spider and the Fly. 133 \" Nonsense,\" said Carrie, angrily; \" Ruth can judge for herself, and, if she likes the man, the man has something in him.\" \" Carrie is smitten ! Carrie is captivated ! \" cried the girls, and they all began chaffing her in a way which would have been intolerable to a sensitive nature, but which she met in kind, and rather enjoyed than otherwise, till a summons from Mrs. Maltby sent them all to their beds. Mr. Stone did not call at the Hall the following day. The Baronet's invitation had savoured too much of patronage to be wholly acceptable, and, if be had found pleasure in his incidental meeting with the daughter, and even, to a certain degree, in his casual intercourse with the father, at Mile End Villa, he was as yet far from feeling inclined to abandon his beloved solitude in order to embark again in the routine of worldly and social inter course. Still, the; consequences of that first imprudent step be took in allowing himself to be seen at the garden party could not be entirely averted. Syston might have ignored the new visitor of the Maltbys, who were themselves new people in the locality ; Syston might have doubted the propriety of even the trim and punctilious Mrs. Turner's recognising a stranger without more authenticated credentials ; but Syston bad, with its own eves, seen its own Baronet, itsgreat man, converse publicly with Mr. Stone at Mile End Villa,"], [138, "134 Doctor Greystone. for fully twenty minutes ; Syston had overheard the given invitation to the Hall ; Syston had observed Miss Barston shaking hands with Mrs. Ralph's lodger, while she only gave a smile and a nod to half the country side ; therefore Syston, in the meek spirit of the sheep of Panurge, decreed that it must follow its leader, and considered it a duty to call on Mr. Stone and give him the freedom of its homes. Mrs. Ralph's inmates had been mostly curates and artists, who had never dreamt of deny ing themselves to any stray visitors ; so the good woman, whenever Mr. Stone happened to be in, did not hesitate to usher into his sitting room all those who came to see him. Mr. Stone, taken by surprise and unprepared, found it difficult to decline verbally the verbal invitations to teas, kettledrums, dinners, and small gather ings, which generally concluded the visit or were the object of it, and stood committed where it would have been gratuitous rudeness to resist. Mrs. Turner, determined to carry out her plans, selected a rainy afternoon, and, accompanied by her daughter Selina, invaded the cottage with the assumption of frankness and good-nature which enabled her to do, and be praised for doing, the very things which she would have strictly censured in others. She had in some occult fashion made for herself a reputation of unini pugnable virtue aud unparalleled motherly devo-"], [139, "The Spider and the Fly. 135 tion, under cover of which she had braved certain regies de convenance, and deputed her maternal cares to nurses and governesses without exciting remarks or doubts. Her universal kindliness and charity, never being tested, wa's never disputed ; widowhood had invested her with chaste inviola bility ; healthy, rich, prosperous, not bowed down by the grief of her bereavement, particularly fitted by her constitution and mental stolidity to fight her own battles and promote her daughter's welfare, she was the last person in the world to deserve or excite commiseration, yet she was generally spoken of as \"poor dear Mrs. Turner,\" and the double adjective imparted to her an additional saintly grace. She had superficial and fluent warmth of speech ; her truisms and com monplaces, like her welcome, were at the service of all ; she was far from chary of her advice, her patronage, or her interference, but she was neither short-sighted nor improvident, and reaped a ten fold harvest for every apparent benefit she conferred. She had the art of eliciting gossip, of drawing out scandal, of handling reputations while seeming to deprecate and refute indiscretion, pleading for the defence to bring forth accusations ; and when she knew all she wanted to know, and had collected her damning evidence, she would, in her soft, purring voice, wonder how people could be so wicked as to spread such calumnious reports, and declare it would be her"], [140, "Doctor Greystone. 136 business to contradict them. \"Which, to do her justice, she did, previously retailing them afresh to secure that opportunity. When she disliked a person \u2014 andihis had occurred two or three times \u2014 she did not openly confess to her animosity, but a dark story would be mysteriously circulated, a story that \"even poor dear Mrs. Turner only faintly pooh-poohed with all her good-nature, you know,\" and the ostracised individuals had to accept their doom, neither the victims nor the judges being aware who had been the perse cutor. She kept open house. To have it full was her pride ; to secure lions or celebrities on a three-days' visit, her ambition and constant aim. If the lion was unattainable, she fabricated one \u2014 a dangerous experiment in London, where detection is immi nent, but not a very hazardous one in the country \u2014 and she invested him with a fame and achieve ments of her own creating, somewhat after the fashion of those dealers in antiquities who, when they run short of Pompeiian bronzes, stain a new iron vessel with sulphate of copper, and palm it off on the unsuspecting amateur as the last spoil ofa recent excavation. On that rainy afternoon, having ascertained through Mrs. Ralph that her lodger was indoors, she gently pushed the good woman aside, and, dispensing with an introduction, knocked at Mr. Stone's parlour door ; almost before the words"], [141, "The Spider and the Fly. 137 \" Come in\" had reached her ear, she entered with Selina. \"Do not let us disturb you, dear Mr. Stone,\" she said in her head voice, as the Doctor rose from his writing table, and greeted the ladies with his grave politeness. \" Wre are invading your sanctum in the most impertinent fashion, yet surely you are too gallant to drive .us away.\" Mr. Stone bowed. \" I will not stay* long, Mr. Stone ; indeed, it would be hardly proper, but I was passing your door with the child, and, as I am a believer in doing things oneself and not by deputy, I came in to proffer my request, and,\" she added with her best matronly smile, \" to put you in the impossi bility of refusing it. Besides,\" she continued with a slightly interrogative air, \" I think we have some common friends in Warwickshire, the Carmichaels ? I am not mistaken, am I ? \" \" I am afraid you are, Mrs. Turner ; I have not the honour of their acquaintance. Indeed, I hardly think I know anyone in Warwickshire.\" \" Ah ! then you are not related to the Stones of Leamington ? \" \" I am not,\" briefly replied the Doctor. \" Well, no matter ; if we have no common friends, we shall strike up a friendship of our own. To cement it, you must come to me on Monday next.\" Mr. Stone attempted an excuse, but Mrs."], [142, "138 Doctor Greystone. Turner refused to listen. \" It is Selina's birthday ; you cannot say me nay. What ? you must. . . Oh, my dear Mr. Stone, this will not do at all ; if not Monday, Tuesday ? Wednesday ? I will not be beaten, you see. But you will think better of it, and come on Monday. Half-past seven. Not sharp, you know. Ours is a house of women \u2014 no ?narti net to be excruciatingly punctual. Monday, eh ? \" Mr. Stone had no resource but to be persuaded, and to let it be Monday. Mrs. Turner put her glasses to her eye, and began a survey of the room, pointing out a microscope to her daughter, and playfully begging Mr. Stone to show a few slides to \" the child \" (Selina was seventeen). During the exhibition, she amused herself by taking up a volume here and there, examining the titles, and especially the fly-leaf. She came to the conclusion that Mr. Stone was careless about his library, as his name was on none of the volumes ; that he had lived in France, as many of the books were in that language ; and that he had made medicine, or surgery, either his profession or his hobby ; at any rate, he was a savant, a scholar, and should be introduced to her friends as one of the most \"distinguished specialists \" of the day. Having achieved the double object of her visit, she put down her glasses, and walking up to Selina, placed her arm round the girl's shoulders in the motherly way which was familiar to her, saying ;"], [143, "The Spider and the Fly. 139 \"Come, pet, it is time to go. We have been paying Mr. Stone quite a visitation. You have had quite a treat, have you not, child?\" ' Yes, mother darling,\" answered Selina, demurely. She had been as bored by the verte brae of a flea and the mildew on a barley-corn as Dr. Stone had been wearied by the explanation of both ; but she was too well trained not to put the correct intonation of enthusiasm and gratitude in her answer. Mrs. Turner departed after a few more common places, and before the Monday came, managed to inform a good many people that she had con sidered herself bound to offer some attention to a man who, although he had come to Syston for rest from arduous scientific labours, was yet too gifted and intellectual to be permitted to remain in absolute isolation. He certainly was what the French cull sauvage, and had some of the eccentri cities of genius, but she would soon make him feel at home, and of course his coming to her need not entail promiscuous visiting. Thus it happened that in the course of the summer James Greystone found himself insen sibly yet irresistibly caught in the meshes and dragged into the sort of social intercourse he had never liked, and had for so long utterly renounced. He accepted it in the same spirit of passive aban donment which now seemed to have become a second nature. The vitality of any actiye power"], [144, "140 Doctor Greystone, had deserted him ; even the strength of resistance failed. He had fallen to the tacit acceptance of destiny, unmoved, unguided by him. Trials which to some are like the tempering of steel had left him irresolute and disheartened. Never a man of sanguine temperament, when the balance of his mind had been roughly shaken, he did not recover his equilibrium or find in action the distraction from his thoughts. Grief, it is true, had lost its poignancy ; regret, the bitterness that had sent him a restless wanderer through distant climes ; but the inability to revert to healthy occupation, the shrinking from human companion ship, human sympathy, human approbation, had remained. The worker had become a dreamer, the zealous toiler in the field of science was con tent to let the harvest go ungarnered, the fruits of his labour lie wasted and sterile. The generous philanthropist, the benefactor of mankind, the diligent searcher after new methods of healing had been satisfied to exercise his old professional skill only when the opportunity offered to minister to a sick labourer or save a cottager's child. Little wonder then that in his present lethargy he should drift into assimilation with those w*ho invaded his solitude, as he bad drifted into isolation : from absolute indifference. To resist the advances which he did not encourage would have given him more trouble than to yield to them ; and, while the majority were discouraged"], [145, "Dr. Greystone Explains. 141 by his irresponsiveness, a few, among whom were Mrs. Turner and Mrs. Maltby, succeeded in establishing an apparent intimacy with him \u2014 to the extent that all Syston recognised the fact that he was their particular friend, and that both ladies were justified in establishing a joint proprietorship in Mr. Stone. CHAPTER VIII. DR. GREYSTONE EXPLAINS. However, long before the autumn had set in, an incident occurred which, had Mr. Stone been less absorbed, he would have known to be inevitable. From indolence and an intolerable sensitiveness about the past he had virtually assumed a false name, and was equally unprepared to support the alias or renounce it, hardly giving a second thought to the error which had curtailed and changed Greystone into Stone. He became aware of his folly in the most simple manner. His acquaintance with Miss Barston had not gone beyond accidental meetings. Sir Everett, for some reason or other, had not again crossed his path, and it did not appear to him as if they should ever be brought into close communion, when he received a note from Ruth. \" Dear Mr. Stone,\" she wrote, \" my father has been suffering from one of the nervous"], [146, "142 Doctor Greystone. attacks which of late have become so much more frequent. Without being, we are told, dangerous, they incapacitate him for much exertion. This must be his excuse for not calling on you sooner. He is as yet unable to take any exercise, and wishes me to say that he hopes you will waive ceremony and dine with us on the 17th. \" Yours very truly, \" Ruth Barston \" Do tell me what you think of him. I am anxious.\" This postcriptum was written in pencil, and had evidently been hastily added, probably after the note was presented for Sir Everett's approval. The short line decided Mr. Stone's acceptance, and he prepared to answer the invitation in the affirmative. It happened to be the first note he had written since his arrival at Syston to any one living in the place, and when it was nearly con cluded he found himseh confronted with the necessity of appending his signature. He could not use the name that was not his, nor yet write \" James Greystone \" under a letter answering one addressed to Mr. Stone. The awkwardness of his situation was suddenly and disagreeably impressed upon him, and he would at once have sent a curt negative to Miss Barston had the necessity of an explanation been disposed of in that way. He felt, however, that sooner or later"], [147, "Dr. Greystone Explains. 143 it must be made; and that to no one would it be so easy as to the girl who had ever met him with quiet and yet sympathetic geniality. Tearing up the formal note of acceptance he proceeded to begin another, which did not appa rently satisfy him, for it shared the same fate. Several successive attempts were equally unsuc cessful; and, impatient of the irksomeness of his task, he snatched up his hat, and, determining to get over the difficulty verbally, he started for the Hall. During the walk, which extended over several miles, the object of his visit gradually faded from his mind ; his thoughts reverted mechanically to the short, hurried line at the end of Miss Barston's ceremonious note. She must have been deeply concerned to address him thus confidentially, almost imploringly. Was there really cause for alarm in Sir Everett's condi tion ? Ruth was not a hysterical or nervous woman : he had seen her collected and prac tical by the bedside of the keeper's child. If she was anxious, if she appealed to his professional skill, and called in his professional aid, it could only be because her father was in danger, and that Dr. Leslie was impotent to fight the disease. \" No wonder,\" he thought ; \" that dodder headed, amiable old fool would rather kill his patients in an orthodox fashion, than save them"], [148, "Doctor Greystone. 144 by stepping out of bis groove, and Sir Everett, if I do not wrong him greatly, would almost as soon succumb to the old treatment, than get well with a new method. He sticks to the ancient formulas, and vetoes innovation. He has studied and read, though, and knows what he is talking about. His obstinacy is not ignorance, and he may yet be convinced \u2014 a dunce never is.\" And then he formed in his mind a rapid diagnosis of the origin and cause of the nervous disorder under which Sir Everett laboured. The physician's eye had unknow ingly in that one interview noted symptoms which now recurred to him with the habitual clearness of his diagnosis : the slight twitching of the drooping lids, the occasional tremulous ness of the long, aristocratic hands, the sudden quickly arrested hesitation of the voice in the smooth, rounded sentences, and the want of stamina betrayed by the colourless skin and springless gait. \" That man has some secret sorrow, or some hidden disease ; he is too proud to own to either, and for some reason or other conceals his suffering as long as he can. It is his desire to appear superior to weakness. Vanity, like a straight waistcoat, hurts, but sustains him.\" When he reached the Hall, although he asked to see Miss Barston, he was ushered into a large apartment lined with books from floor"], [149, "Dr. Greystone Explains. 145 to ceiling, Sir Everett's library, and the room where he spent the most of his time. It was empty, and at the sight of that rich collection of complete and rare editions the instincts of the student awoke, and for the first time a faint glow of enthusiasm kindled in his cold, lustreless eye. He slowly walked round the bookcases, every now and then lifting out a volume, and opening it on the palm of his hand with that almost reverential touch of the bibliophile, recognising, with a pleased feeling of companionship, some of the most valued works that he used to peruse at the British Museum, or the Bibliotheque Nationale of Paris ; and glancing with envy at others which bore on the title page the names of English and foreign scientists. His favourite study, his great utopy, was represented, and he felt that to have the run of that library would be a precious and inestimable privilege. He was still handling* a treatise on vivisection when Sir Everett entered unperceived, dismissing at the door a valet on whose arm he had been leaning. He came forward with languid and feeble steps. He looked, if possible, thinner and paler than before ; the lines in his forehead and round his mouth spoke alike of pain endured and of a strong effort to repress it. All his courtesy of manner remained unchanged, however, and he laid his long white fingers on the open page, saying : K"], [150, "146 Doctor Greystone. \" You have been a long time coming to see my book, Mr. Stone, but better late than never. Pray be seated.\" The Baronet sank a little wearily in his deep arm-chair. \" I have taken a constitutional on the terrace,\" he resumed, \" and I found the weather somewhat oppressive for this time of the year. Our fickle English climate always surprises one unprepared.\" The visitor suspected another reason for the unmistakable exhaustion of the speaker than the one he suggested, but accepted it. An inquiry about the Baronet's health being met with the very slighest recognition of any ailment what ever, the subject of the book was at once resumed, and the two men soon became im mersed in the technicalities of their topic. It was the morbid horror which Sir Everett had of being thought an invalid which had some years back made him take up the study of medicine, and he had doctored himself in private, with no other result than to aggravate his symptoms. He promptly recognised the superior information of bis visitor, not only as compared to himself, but to Dr. Leslie, and it pleased and interested him to turn it to account. The grave attention with which Mr. Stone listened, and of which he could not divine the real cause, flattered him ; and, after a lengthy argument, he remarked : \"My dear sir, I bow to you; you are no"], [151, "Dr. Greystone Explains. 147 amateur, no mere dabbler in the Hypocratic art, as I modestly confess myself to be. You have entered the lists in good earnest and won your spurs. I know I am correct, and trust I am not indiscreet in supposing you to be a physician or a surgeon.\" These words recalled Mr. Stone to the real purport of his visit, which he had entirely for gotten. They also reminded him that it was not to the hypercritical Baronet that he had intended to make his confession. An imperceptible hesita tion delayed his answer ; when it came it was given in his cold, calm voice: \" I must, before coming to this point, Sir Everett, correct a mistake which has been made by you and others about my name.\" \" A mistake? \" said the Baronet, with a slight elevation of his eyebrows. He did not like to be told that he could fall into any error, and Mr. Stone's name was both unimportant to him and irrelevant to the subject under treatment. Before the Doctor could resume, the door was opened, two footmen brought in a tea-table, and Ruth followed, ready to give her father his afternoon cup of tea. She seemed pleased to see Mr. Stone, and gratified at the apparently gracious manner of her father towards him. She quietly took her place at the table, and busied herself with the cups, after shaking hands with her guest. A quick glance of intelligence, and a"], [152, "148 Doctor Greystone. beseeching look at the slightly drooping figure of the Baronet, seemed to voice the meaning of the last line of her note. Mr. Stone had thought that it would be easier to explain to Miss Barston, but before her clear, truthful eyes it seemed more difficult to own to even a tacit want of sincerity. Sir Everett's cold superciliousness was less imposing than the gentle serenity of the half-averted face and the quiet grace of the slender, grey-clad figure. \"My dear Ruth,\" said the Baronet, \"Mr. Stone was just telling me as you came in that there has been some mistake about his name. I fear \u2014 my daughter is my amanuensis, my dear sir, for little social matters \u2014 I fear, Ruth, that you have not been accurate in your spelling of it. I cannot sufficiently impress upon you the necessity of not being remiss in so elementary a courtesy.\" The young girl looked up in surprise ; a faint blush came to her cheeks. \"Pray forgive me,\" she said, turning to her visitor. \" I do not remember ever having seen your name written, and I supposed \" \"Do not add another word, Miss Barston, I beg of you. The fault is mine \u2014 mine only. My name is not ' Stone ' but ' Greystone ' \u2014 James Greystone.\" Involuntarily his voice fell a little on the last words. He seemed to hear that name called out again by the greffier of the Juge"], [153, "Dr. Greystotie Explains. 149 d' Instruction. \" Foolishly, as it now appears to me,\" he resumed, \" I neglected to correct the few people who first addressed me here when they curtailed my surname by half. It seemed so immaterial to me, I suppose, how I was called in a locality where I came as a stranger and did not expect to remain.\" \"And where, I trust, you have made friends enough by now to induce you to change your plans,\" said Ruth kindly, divining with feminine intuition that the admission had not been a pleasant one to make, and lingering with a grace ful emphasis on the word \"friends.\" \" I have no wish to leave Syston now,\" said Dr. Greystone, with a good deal more truth and a little more warmth than he would have put into his answer had any other than Ruth asked the question. \" But when a man has been a long time a wanderer he does not realise that he can ever be anything than a nomad.\" \" And, after all, what is life but a rather tedious journey on a route where no return tickets are issued?\" said Sir Everett, with his mirthless smile. It was perfectly uninteresting to him whether his guest went by one name or another, and he thought the interruption and explanation almost superfluous. \"I shall trouble you for another cup of tea, my dear Ruth,\" he continued; and when it had been given to him with the meticulous nicety which alone found favour in"], [154, "150 Doctor Greystone. his epicurean eyes, he reverted to the question that had preoccupied him. \"Your admission of being a great traveller answers in the negative my query as to your being an M.D.,\" he said. James Greystone let this speech pass in silence, and Sir Everett added, in his most circumstantial manner, \" The technicalities of your speech, a practical shrewdness of deduction, a certainty of analysis, points to professional experience, and would have deceived a more experienced observer even than myself into the belief that you were in the active service of Galen. But our modern \u00c6sculapius is not what you call yourself \u2014 a wanderer and a nomad. He rarely roams many miles from Harley Street, and abhors foreign practice. This accounts for the stolidity and standstill of our School of Medicine. Knight hood, a French cook, and hundred-guinea fees at home are not conducive to new departures and fresh researches abroad.\" \"Can you wonder at it?\" said Dr. Greystone, relieved from the obligation of stating his pro fession. \"The man whom chance, good luck, patronage, or, say, merit, has pushed onwards to the popularity which is the safest form of success, asks no more. The pioneers of progress, those to whom science owes its longest strides, its widest flights, are the unknown, the disappointed, the ignored. They open the trenches, they pour out their life-blood, they toil in misery, bitterness, and"], [155, "Dr. Greystone Explains. 151 obscurity. What for? To make the roads through which others pass on to glory.\" \" Quite so, quite so,\" said the Baronet, with a cynical shrug of his shoulders; \" the world is full of great men whom nobody knows, and of little men whom everybody extols. Genius goes to the wall ; ignorance achieves glory ; but, for ali that, the genius and the dunce are both im beciles.\" \" And the experience of a life-time only tends to show the errors of others.\" \" The wise man is he who makes all things subservient to his happiness. If his mistress squints, he looks only at her profile ; if his dog gets the rabies, he sends it not to Monsieur Pasteur, but to his mother-in-law ; if his friend makes love to his wife, he lends him money, and thus gets rid of him. Believe me, my dear sir, there is no fallacy so great as wanting to set things right for others. Make them right for yourself, and let others do the same.\" James Greystone was about to reply, when he caught a pained expression in Ruth's eyes. The selfish philosophy of her father was ever a source of sorrow to her ; she unconsciously dreaded to hear it echoed by the man who had been so tender and so gentle with an ailing child. Perhaps that glance softened his answer. \" A creed for the strong only, Sir Everett ; one inapplicable to the weak.\""], [156, "152 Doctor Greystone. \"Weakness is a fault, Mr. Greystone ; a fault always, a crime sometimes. In a friend, a dam nable thing.\" \"And is not friendship a weakness in itself: bne to be bitterly atoned for ? \" said James Grey- Stone, with a cruel recollection of the man whom he had made welcome at his fireside, and who had so shamelessly betrayed bis trust. \" You do not believe in friendship, then, Mr. St Mr. Greystone?\" said Ruth, raising her frank, gentle eyes to the Doctor's perturbed face. \" I pity you, I do.\" The unconscious sadness, the slight severity of the young girl's tone dispelled the bitterness of that long-past treachery, and Greystone would fain have recalled his words, or at least modified them, had not Sir Everett, who saw the con versation about to fall to the share of his daughter, suddenly reverted to the French treatise. \" You agree with Bobin, Mr. Greystone, I understand,\" he said, turning over a few pages. \"I am afraid, my dear Ruth, we shall become uninteresting to you, and if Mr. Greystone has finished his tea, I am sure he will excuse you, and not inflict a classical dissertation on a young lady.\" Sir Everett was ever scrupulously ceremonious in his bearing towards his daughter; this as sumption of ancien regime courtesy, a courtesy faultless in the minutest details, glossed over to"], [157, "Dr. Greystone Explains. 153 the world and to his own eyes the absence of all parental warmth and affection. Ruth, accus tomed to be summoned and dismissed at her father's pleasure, rose, and quietly prepared to leave the library. As for a brief moment James Greystone held her cool, white hand in his, a current of unwonted sympathy seemed to awaken in his breast a comprehension of the joyless, effaced life of abnegation led by the young girl, and with it an inexplicable desire to protect and cheer her. He seemed during the short moment that the pressure of their fingers lasted to under stand how incomplete was the destiny of that uncomplaining woman, and a faint wonder arose as to whether she had suffered in the past, or if she was only a girl to whom the brightness and beauty of existence had never come. \" May I hope to see you before I leave the Hall, Miss Barston?\" he said, detaining* her hand one instant longer. She looked up gratefully. He would tell her what he thought of the Baronet. \" I shall be in the rose-garden, Mr. Greystone,\" she said simply, and with an inclination of her head withdrew."], [158, "154 Doctor Greystone. CHAPTER IX. RUTH ANSWERS DR. GREYSTONE'S QUESTION. It was late when James Greystone joined Ruth in the old-fashioned rosery. Sir Everett had been loth to dismiss a companion who was that rare and exceedingly grateful combination : an inde pendent talker and an excellent listener. Through their very dissimilarity, the two men were drawn together. The careless unconsciousness of the one was proof against the aristocratic hauteur of the other ; the quiet, unobtrusive, but uncom promising frankness of Greystone was not aggres sive enough to alarm the polished egotism of the Baronet. They discussed without jarring, and differed without losing their tempers, while a certain elevation of thought, refinement of speech, and facility of elocution which they had in com mon imparted a peculiar flavour to the exchange of their opinions. Both well read, endowed with a retentive memory, and possessing a wide range of information, they were able to touch upon topics beyond the ken of the ordinary people they met. They parted mutually pleased with each other, and with the tacit understanding of a prompt renewal of their intercourse. Dr. Greystone had not been unmindful of Miss Barston's charge ; he had made good use of his opportunities for observation, so that when Ruth came towards him wish an eager question in her"], [159, "Ruth Answers Dr. Greystone's Question. 155 eyes, he did not wait for her to interrogate him, but said at once without a preamble : \"I see no cause for present alarm in Sir Everett's condition, Miss Barston. That he is not robust, I cannot deny, and, if my surmises are correct, his brain, without being in the slightest way affected, is over-wrought, over-strained \u2014 by anxiety or work, it is not for me to tell.\" \" My father has no cause for worry or trouble, Mr. Greystone \u2014 at least that I am aware of,\" she added w*ith a little hesitation, and a sudden per ception of how little she was admitted to the Baronet's confidence. \" As for work, he is ever with his books, sits up very late in the library, and even when not exhausted by7 nights of pain, the intensity7 of which he conceals, takes hardly any outdoor exercise.\" \" Surely I have been told that Sir Everett rides, and is a sportsman ?\" \" Yes, he used to ride a great deal, went to the meets, although he does not follow the hounds. He thinks it his duty as ' the Squire ' to be present, but that is only in the autumn. As for shooting, it is, I may say, the only amusement he ever takes, and even that in moderation and to gratify Bertie, my brother, who is never as happy as with a gun in his hand.\" \"Less burning of the midnight oil and more noon-day sun would be advisable. I presume Doctor Leslie attends your father.\""], [160, "156 Doctor Greystone. \" He is the family doctor, certainly,\" said Ruth with a little deprecatory shrug of her shoulders, implying small faith in the Syston practitioner. \" He is very kind, and does his best no doubt, but he does not understand papa, and papa has taken a dislike to him. Doctor Leslie offended him some time back by insisting that he was an invalid, and should give up most of his habits of life. This was an unpardonable error, as my father strongly objects to being thought even ailing. He rarely ever calls the poor man in, and when compelled to do so gives him no opportunity of ascertaining what really is amiss with his patient. \" I should recommend in that case having a good physician from London.\" \"Impossible. Papa would not hear of it.\" \" Could you not persuade Sir Everett to adopt so obvious and sensible a course?\" \"I persuade papa!\" said Ruth, in a tone of wonderment which, uncomplaining as it was, spoke volumes. \" Papa would not heed me. He has but a poor opinion of the commonsense of women in general ; Bertie is too young, too thoughtless to have any influence, and, moreover, he stands up for Doctor Leslie.

He gave the required promise freely, unconditionally, resolved to keep it and to take upon his broad shoulders the responsibility that weighed so heavily on the slender ones of the girl before him.

James Greystone soon took up a position and filled a place at Barston Hall which no one before him had occupied in that exclusive, unapproachable home. Gradually it became an accepted thing that he should spend most of his time with the father or the daughter. When Sir Everett was particularly engaged on some research, he would detain Greystone for days together under his roof, not allowing him to return to the cottage. Always impatient of any obstacle to his fancies or passing whims, he could not brook the delays and uncertainty of mere visits, and wanted his new friend to be constantly at hand. In the large, somewhat sombre library the two men had much grave converse, and the Doctor was able un suspected to fulfil the mission entrusted to him by Ruth. With her he spent pleasant hours in the gardens, or the cool drawing room, and accompanied her in her walks and charitable visits to the poor and sick. It had all happened so simply, so quietly, so naturally, that not one of the three people who had drifted into such close intimacy could tell how it had begun and ripened. \" I cannot realise that we have known you so short a time,\" said Ruth one day to Greystone, after she had talked at length about her life at the Hall, her occupations, and her poor, in the familiar way now habitual to her. \" It seems to"], [163, "Ruth Answers Dr. Greystone's Question, 159 me as if you had been our friend as far back as I can remember.\" And, in truth, the past was fast fading out of her memory, and the present to assert itself victorious and all-engrossing. She rejoiced un selfishly in the novel communion, because she felt her father safe under that watchful eye, that constant yet occult care ; she saw that Grey stone's silent influence seemed to forestall and avert the impending attacks of nervous pain, and that the Baronet was daily more contented, less captious, more amenable to familiar intercourse, and not so cynical and severe in his judgments. But that was not all : she rejoiced also because in her own life a new and unexpected brightness had come unawares. It seemed as if, after having been prematurely old, she was retracing her footsteps, and treading afresh a path she had crossed of yore, unwitting of its attractions ; she felt a more jubilant life course through her veins ; she experienced the gladsome sensations of buoyant, hopeful, aspiring youth. She learnt the joyous lesson that is whispered to children, and that maidens take to heart ; her step was quicker and more elastic, her dark, deep eyes brightened with happy thoughts untold ; the rare smile, that had always so much sadness mingled with its sweetness, came and went with a tender radiance ; her voice, once so low, so toneless, so hushed, took argentine"], [164, "Doctor Greystone. 160 notes as it rose and fell in gay cadence with unwonted repartee. She knew the subtle charm of appearing pleasant to the eyes of another ; the gentle pride of being looked up to, consulted, and trusted ; the grave content of seeing her wishes divined, her individuality recognised ; in the frank and direct approbation of her father's guest, she became cognizant of her own worth, and prized it because he appreciated it. With the bloom on her cheek, with the gladness in her eyes, came a change even in her attire. Ruth had always worn quiet greys and browns, and, though ever ladylike and refined, ignored those pretty coquetries of costume which other girls acquire by instinct in the admiration of an observant circle ; now that a quiet remark would tell her that her gown was becoming, that she looked best in white, she took an unconscious pleasure in her appearance. Few women, save the empty headed ones, care for dress intrinsically; it is only to them part of the great cult of love ; they adorn not themselves, but the form that has found favour in one most dear, and the observing bystander can read in the delicate touches of a girl's toilet if she is beloved or neglected. James Greystone had not remained long in the atmosphere of a nature so congenial, so comple mentary to his own in its serenity, reserve, and purity, without falling under its gentle influence. The study of the quiet young girl's character was"], [165, "Ruth Answers Dr. Greystone's Question. 161 to him strangely attractive. As he used to watch the bird in the foliage, the silver-scaled trout in the sombre eddies of brooks, the opening of the frail perfumed blossoms under the shadows of heavy fronds, so it became to him an hourly interest to draw out the charming, fresh, unsuspected juvenility of the girl whom he had first met a pale, nun-like creature, ignored and ignoring, known to the world only by her deeds of mercy. It delighted him to summon the half effaced figure from the background where it had dwelt so long, bring it out into the light and sunshine, and see it, expand into a central and engrossing personality. James Greystone did not ask himself what this feeling was. Love, as other men understand it, he had never known. His one absorbing passion for science had made him the slave of that jealous mistress, and women were as yet a sealed book to him. The one he had called wife had never been much more than a stranger. With the single exception of his mother, he had received from no female hands either care or attention, and had not deemed it possible to find in a female breast a response to his aspirations, to meet in a female mind a guiding spirit.

They were in no hurry to precipitate the inevitable moment which would surely come to them under the shadow of the old Hall, at its appointed time. The hour came. It came not with romance, or premeditation, or sentimental love passages \u2014 \u25a0 it came as was most fit between the disen chanted man who had suffered and the girl who had never enjoyed \u2014 it came in the autumn twilight, under the leafless trees, in a chill November mist, to the sound of the wind moaning over the sodden forest paths. Ruth Barston had been to the village with some tiny clothing she had hastily put together for an improvident mother, whom a frequent occurrence of similar events should have found better prepared. She had been delayed by the long recital of the poor woman's tribulations, and when she left the cottage the short day was draw ing to its close. Greystone, who knew of her errand, solicitous about her lengthened absence, and uneasy at the gathering darkness, had come from the Hall to meet her. He saw her on the outskirts of the park, nearing a stile which divided"], [168, "164 Doctor Greystone. the woods from the meadow land beyond. As she approached, even in the fading light, he thought she looked pale and fagged; but at sight of him a soft pink stole to her cheeks, and she quickened her walk. Their hands joined over the stile. \" This is too late for you to be out alone, Miss Barston, or, indeed, out at all in this cold, damp fog. You are chilled through,\" he added, as a slight shiver shook the girl's frame. \" I \u00ab... very cold,\" she answered, \" and I had no idea it was so late ; but P could not leave poor Mrs. Robson sooner. You see, she has no one to look after her.\" \" She has a husband.' \"Who does not look after her.

Why, even at the cottage Mrs. Ralph used to do her best for me when I came back wet and tired, while you \" \" Oh,\" said Ruth, simply, \" I have always been used to looking after myself.\" \" And others,\" he said a little sternly, as if to himself. \" But that is not a fair division of labour,\" he added quietly, \" one which I shall not countenance when \" \" When \" repeated Ruth. He did not answer at once. She looked up in his face. Something she read there as they emerged into an opening of the wood where more light lingered made her heart beat tumultuously. Instinctively she made an attempt to withdraw her arm. Greystone gently laid his hand on hers and detained it.

The band over which his clasp tightened lay passive and trembling in his grasp. Kulh's head was hem to the ground, a slight smile played on her lips, while a deep-drawn sigh of intense happiness fell on the hushed air. They were still walking very fast. The Doctor had not for one minute relaxed the speed which he considered essential to counteract the effects of the chill. He did not press the girl to speak ; indeed, his had not been a question.

It must not be supposed that Syston had mutely accepted the revelation that the Mr. Stone it had taken to its bosom was not Mr. Stone at all, but James Greystone. The news had come upon its little world like a shock. It seemed a sudden overthrow of the rock of respectability on which the stranger had been placed, and necessi tated, as it were, a fresh edification of good reasons for accepting him anew. Syston, as before, deter mined to look to its leaders and to adopt the course they pursued. The rank and file prudently ab stained from outward manifestations, and confined their wonderment to strictly family conclaves, waiting till the higher authorities had spoken to follow in their wake. It was more difficult to ascertain the opinion of the Hall, as the Barstons were always cloaked in chill reserve, but St. John's Lodge and Mile End Villa, not being of a reticent nature, would probably give a prompt clue to their social intentions. Mrs. Turner's mind was quickly made up. She owed it to herself and her reputation to remain true to her colours, and to uphold the man under whatever name it pleased him to appear. It cost her, it is true, an unpleasant pang to relinquish the theory of the Warwickshire Stones, which she bad freely propagated, and entailed new"], [172, "Doctor Greystone. 168 genealogical researches ; but she could not expose herself to the accusation of unjustified patronage in the eyes of her small circle of worshippers and sycophants. Had there been within reach or in prospect any person \u2014 man, woman or child \u2014 capable of replacing the stranger as an importa tion, a, protege, a discovery, the merest apology for a lion of the very tame breed she boasted of in her menagerie, she would not have had the slightest scruple in dropping the whilom Mr. Stone entirely; but in the present penury and circumstances Mrs. Turner, having praised him, clothed him with purely fictitious distinction, and endowed him with a social status of her own creation \u2014 in a word, having adopted him, she was loth to give him up. She had been able to boast that he had visited and dined at St. John's Lodge more than in any other house at Syston ; she had spoken of the gratifica tion to him of intellectual communion in her society ; she had stated that he never passed her door without entering it, or met her in the lanes without offering his escort, and, in support of this hyperbolical statement, had managed to be seen driving him in her pony carriage. To abandon this vantage ground, was gall and wormwood to her ; she had authorized Syston to dwell on \" poor dear Mrs. Turner's kindness to Mr. Stone,\" and to expatiate on the good fortune of Mr. Stone in having \" such a home to go to.\" Weighing these things, Mrs. Turner determined"], [173, "Mrs. Turner makes tip her Mind. 169 not only to condone the matter of the name, but to explain it away, and, in accordance with her invariable system of persuading herself first of a fallacy before attempting to graft it on others, she said to her daughter : \"You understand, Selina dear, it is of no consequence whatever by what name we call our good friend, and we should be culpable if we made him responsible for Mrs. Ralph's blunder and Miss Barston's negligence. I think it is our duty to be just as civil to him as ever, and not to allow Mrs. Maltby and those untutored girls of hers to take this opportunity of getting hold of him, more than might be quite agreeable to him. Now, remember, Selina dear, no unladylike gossiping with Sally and Jessie. Dr. Greystone is our friend much more than the Maltbys', and we must not forget it.\" \" Yes, mother darling,\" answered Selina, with the ready acquiescence which she always vouch safed to any remark of her mother's, but without deeming it obligatory to mention that she had, only an hour ago, discussed the mysterious and romantic incident at length with Jessie, her own bosom friend, and considered it as quite the most delightfully mysterious episode of the stranger's life among them. But Mrs. Maltby did not view it in that light, and was at once in arms against what she was pleased to call an imposition. She chose to"], [174, "170 Doctor Greystone. consider herself personally affronted and signalled out as a dupe ; she burst forth into loud denuncia tions against the interloper, blamed her daughters for having tolerated his advances, rebuked her husband for not having instituted stricter inquiries about the stranger at his gates, and worked her self generally into one of her most voluble and eloquent passions. She had succeeded in routing all her opponents save Carrie, who demurely re marked : \" Surely, if he is good enough for the Hall, he is good enough for us.\" \" Nonsense ! \" exclaimed Barbara, infuriated by this allusion. \" It may suit big society people to receive anyone and anybody ; they are no better than they should be themselves, I dare say ; but I hold my own against anyone, high or low, titled and untitled, and I say what I always said : strangers and foreigners are not to be trusted; you never know if they have not been forgers or murderers before you know them.\" \"But, Mother, Mr. Stone is an Englishman.\" \" That is something in his favour, certainly, but an Englishman who does not know his own name ought to be ashamed of himself.\" \" Mrs. Turner knows all about him mother, and you mostly pin your faith to Mrs. Turner.\" \"Caroline!

Barbara always dressed handsomely and richly, even in the country, even during the hottest weather, and, with rustling silks and nodding feathers, she entered Mrs. Turner's cool drawing room, and found that unconscious lady ensconced in her arm-chair, and unprepared for her visit. Unwilling as she was to see her, she rose and greeted Mrs. Maltby with her habitual gushing welcome : \" This is most kind, my dear Mrs. Maltby, and with the glass at eighty-four. How are all the dear girls ? Selina will be in despair when she finds you have not brought dear Sally or dear Jessie. They are such friends, the dear children.\" \" I came alone on purpose, Mrs. Turner. I call this very serious, and, frankly, I don't like it.\" \" What is serious ?

Mr. Stone is blameless. How can he be held responsible for a landlady's stupid blunder ? \" \" He can. He ought to have rectified it at once, and not wait till he was found out.

She was nettled, and insisted on having her prerogative in that matter fully recognised. \"Excuse me, dear Mrs. Maltby \u2014 you did nothing of the kind. I certainly happened to meet the gentleman for the first time at your garden-party, but we needed no third party to make us acquainted. People moving in the same set rarely do.\" \" At any rate,\" hastily retorted Mrs. Maltby, abandoning her former ground and vindicating her original vested right in Mr. Stone's acquaint ance, with as much energy as she had just ar raigned him; \"at any rate, my house was the first in Syston opened to him. He was \u2014 there is no harm in mentioning it \u2014 very much attracted by my Carrie.

I am an English woman of the good old stock, and I conduct my house, my family, and my servants upon good old principles, and not newfangled notions. I say, and I repeat, that when a man goes under a false name, I call him nothing better than a forger, and I feel certain, and don't scruple to say it to anyone who likes to hear it, that he has done something of which he is or should be ashamed. I should not wonder if that Mr. Stone was hiding from the police.\" \" This is downright libel, Mrs. Maltby. How can you be so uncharitable?\" said Mrs. Turner, primly, and looking offended. \" Charity begins at home.

Being anxious to retain Mr. Greystone as a familiar guest, she had sufficient tact to perceive that, should Mrs. Maltby begin a crusade against him, her task would be an unprofitable one. She did not intend to let any one in Syston have more of his company than herself; but, if the role ot patroness suited her, the part of advocate for the defence in the court of public opinion was one she felt no inclination for. After a minute's hesitation, during which she conceived and matured a line of action, she resumed playfully : \" Now, don't be angry with me, my dear Mrs. Maltby, if I let you into a little secret ; on one condition, however, that you promise faithfully not to reveal it.\" The prospect of initiation mollified Mrs. Maltby so far that she gave the required assurance. \"Well,\" continued Mrs. Turner, \" I knew\u2014 indeed, have known for some little time \u2014 from a good source, the very best authority \u2014 I suppose you can guess who my informant was \u2014 that we were entertaining Mr. Greystone unawares.\" Mrs. Turner's conversation was strong in italics"], [181, "Mrs. Turner tnakes up her Mind. 177 at all times, but quite bristled with them when she drew more largely on her imagination. \" Our dear friend is a little distrait, or a little romantic \u2014 perhaps, both; it amused him, it in terested me, to see how long the accidental, ridiculous, fantastic little mistake would be kept up. In point of fact, I suggested that we should not clear it up. I fully intended to make you, my dear Mrs. Maltbj', our confidante, when the whole thing exploded yesterday in the most innocent manner.\" At this juncture, Mrs. Turner had fully per suaded herself of the truth of her hyperbolical assertions, and her voice had taken an accent of veracity which went further to convince Mrs. Maltby than the words themselves. She was beginning to be more vexed at having been left out of the cast of the comedy than at the deception she had so bitterly condemned. \" Well,\" she said, \" I think you are as bad as he is, that is all I can say. And all the palaver about the Warwickshire Stones, was that a part of your amusing little secret also? \" \"Perhaps so; yes, I may say it was.

AU the difference in the world ! You cannot quarrel with Mr. Greystone now, without quarrelling with me, and I hardly think, my clear Mrs. Maltby, that you would like to do that, for the sake of your girls,\" she added with enough significance to make her visitor wince, as she remembered that Mile End Villa had been indebted to St. John's Lodge for much social recognition. Mrs. Turner saw her advantage, and proceeded: \"Of course not; it would be preposterous, absurd ; you are too clever a woman to do anything so foolish. You cannot help meet ing Mr. Greystone constantly ; he is dining here to-morrow, and on Sunday he never fails to come to me. Would you cut him \u2014 allow your daughters to do so ? Would they cut him ?

I could trust them anywhere and with anyone,\" stoutly declared Mrs. Maltby, again shifting her ground with facile and unconscious contradiction. \" I shall prove it by allowing Mr. Greystone the run of my house as formerly, and by not permitting bis position to be questioned.

Their friendship was based on no genuine or mutual liking for each other ; they had no principles, occupations, or tastes in common. Mrs. Turner found Barbara Maltby plain, loud, injudicious, and impolitic ; Mrs. Maltby thought Mrs. Turner artificial, affected, and insincere. The widow censured the freedom of speech and manners tolerated in the Maltby girls; the matron ridiculed the strict and sedulous guardianship placed on Selina. Yet both women had entered upon an unwilling compact of friendliness, easily ruffled, but all the more likely to endure from the very element of antagonism between them. At heart they disagreed on every possible subject while tending to the same end \u2014 the advancement of their social position and the advantageous establishment of their children. To reach it Mrs. Maltby blustered, asserted herself, laid down laws and broke them ; Mrs. Turner purred, fawned, assuaged, yielded, and \u2014 carried her point. When Mrs. Maltby returned to Mile End Villa after her visit, she was waylaid by Carrie. \" Well, Mother,\" she said, \" is the criminal to be judged, drawn, quartered, banished, tabooed? Are we to spurn him \u2014 never to set eyes upon him any more? What has the infallible Mrs. T. ordained? \""], [185, "Mrs. Turner makes up her Mind. 181 \" What nonsense you do talk, Caroline. One would imagine that I was in the habit of being led by the nose, to hear you speak. Moreover, you should remember who it is you are mention ing so disrespectfully. Mr. James Greystone is deserving of more consideration. Look here, Carrie,\" she continued, dropping the dignified reproof to adopt the familiar confidential tone, \" whatever Mrs. Turner might say, I always had my doubts, and thought he could not be of the Warwickshire Stones. Who ever heard of them? He is of a Staffordshire family, and came here to recruit after a most exhaustive season. He is by no means an old man, as men go, and it was a little freak of his that dropping the Grey out of his name for a while. I rather like him for it. It shows there is some go in him, for all his grave manner.\" \" I should like the dear old sobersides better if he dropped some of the grey out of his hair,\" said Carrie irreverently. \" Now don't let him see that you think him superannuated. I insist upon your being at least civil to him.\" \"He doesn't give me the chance, mother,\" said Carrie, who really liked James Greystone. \" I hope you have not given yourself airs with him.

I have ordered"], [186, "182 Doctor Greystone. salmon from London, and he may as well have the benefit of it. Poor dear Mrs. Turner gets her fish from Leicester, and it is always stale.\" By this it may be seen that the offence of the name was condoned, and the friendly relations uninjured. The neighbourhood, finding Mr. Greystone backed by the influential little woman at St. John's Lodge, supported by the Maltbys, and having discovered that the Barstons were utterly indifferent to the change of appellation, laid its doubts to rest, and, after a momentary awkwardness and some embarrassing slips of the tongue, accepted the new denomination, and was as pleased with Mr. Greystone as it had been with Mr. Stone. CHAPTER XL THE BARONET DISCUSSES FRENCH TLAYS. It had been so much a part of Ruth's daily life to have no communion or confidence with those around her, that in the first blush of her new felicity she never felt the want of sharing it with a friend, or the desire to own it to her father. She had never been like other girls ; she ignored the timid yet eager impulse that prompts the petted daughter to run to her parents with her happy secret, and to claim the sympathy of which she is certain. Ruth had ah unacknowledged shrinking from the supercilious, half-pitying, half-"], [187, "The Baronet discusses French Plays. 183 satirical smile with which Sir Everett would listen to the tremulous avowal of her love ; and give a careless, patronizing acquiescence to her lover's suit. She did not for one moment doubt of his consent. What was she ? What had she ever been at the Hall that any interest or objection should be taken to the shaping of her future life? She supposed that James Greystone, when the day came, would carry her away to a home of his own ; she had gathered already that he would not remain in the vicinity of her birthplace, and, with a sudden natural clinging to the old associations, to the father she had silently tended through fits of pain, to the bright young brother who had loved her in his brusque, careless fashion, to the old Hall where all her brief years had been spent in a dull but peaceful monotone, she was un willing to hasten by act of her own the final disruption of those ties, fragile as they once seemed to her. Also, with unconscious diplomacy born of her love, she felt that the longer Sir Everett knew her future husband, the more James Greystone became indispensable to him in his capacity of friend only, the easier it would be eventually for the Baronet to look upon him as a son, and make him in deed as in words one of his family. On the other hand, Dr. Greystone, who was as unworldly as a boy, who had never given a thought to the social position or possible fortune"], [188, "184 Doctor Greystone. of the woman he had asked to be his wife, awoke. after h.e had won hor, to a r.ew feeling of honest pride, which sprang from the deepest and niosl impersonal feeling he had ever experienced his very love for Huth.

This was the plain, honourable course to pursue, but it entailed a separation. He must leave Ruth, breafc up the peaceful intercourse which had brought such happiness to both, and wrought for each such incalculable good, by drawing out all that was tender and human in Greystone's heart, all that was young and fresh and ardent in Ruth's; an intercourse which had softened Sir Everett's misanthropy, and given him the physical relief which up to that time medical aid had been impotent to procure. In fulfilment of this intention, Doctor Greystone nought Ruth one evening after dinner, when the Baronet had retired to his study. It was barely a week* after they had come to that understanding in the November twilight. Her father had been si raiigely, unnaturally unlike himself. After dinner the conversation, which at first, had heen cheerful, touching lightly on literature, music, and the drama, had abruptly taken a gloomy turn. The modern French plays, with their tendencies, strength, and defects, had been discussed. James Greystone, who had frequently heard tint students of the Ecole de Medecine argue with passionate fervour on that theme, was sufficiently well informed to insist on the delicacy of manipulation, the sureness of effect, the excellent writing, and the telling climax of even slender comedies. Sis"], [190, "186 Doctor Greystone. Everett satirised* in his most caustic vein the false sentiment, the exaggeration of bombastic honour, and the bathos of their situations. \" Take for example ' Marcel,' \" he said, \" a little piece I came across the other day. You know it ? AVell, can you imagine anything more untrue to nature?\" \" I maintain that it is physiologically true,\" said Greystone. \"And I deny it. Given a father who kills his only son by accident, what does the French play wright do with that father? He invents a syncope, a loss of memory, an imperfect recovery, a clumsy artifice by which a second child born after the accident is palmed off as the first, and, according to the reviews, there is not a dry pair of eyes in the house at this ridiculous winding up.\" \"Given the situation, however,\" said Greystone, \"the facts are possible. The brain is perfectly capable of engendering singular delusions, and of transposing as it were the past into the pre sent.\" \" A play is not a medical treatise, my dear Sir. A play purports to deal with human nature. What a Frenchman, the creature half tiger, half monkey, may do or may not do, is always unnatural. He may perchance find solace in a hysterical mummery of which he cannot be the dupe, but no father would survive the son he had murdered.\""], [191, "The Baronet discusses French Plays. 187 \" Death is not always so merciful as to come at our call.\" \" Perhaps not, but it can be made to heal the wound it has inflicted. Pshaw ! a man would neither faint nor go crazy after the catastrophe in Marcel; he would kill himself.\" \" Commit suicide ! Oh father ! \" said Ruth. \" Call by that name, if you will, the laying aside of a burden too heavy to bear, the extinction of a life that would be intolerable, the dropping of a remorse that nothing else would allay.\" \" Or, call it moral cowardice,\" drily remarked Greystone. \" That easy bit of cant has long since been exploded ; it is the password of the moralist \u2014 of the epicure who shrinks from the crumpled rose leaf, and who stands on the high ground of self indulgence to fulminate at an act he dare not face. Self destruction is damned \u2014 and, forsooth, by those who deem it chivalrous to vindicate their honour in a duel.\" \" A duel is a loyal and honest combat between man and man.\" \"A duel is a farce, if not to the death, and at its'best only a joint-stock suicide, where the profits, if any, fall to the sharpest partner.

I have no intention of plunging into mortal combat with any Systonite, and, if I am hurried by you into an untimely grave, I must go without the consolation of knowing that an inconsolable father will live to deck my tomb with flowers.\" \" Hush, Bertie ! \" said the Baronet rising ; his pale face had grown paler still. Those two words were pronounced with an accent which made the DoctorTook intently at the speaker. Sir Everett's eyes were fastened on the young man, who had, laughing still, returned to his play with the dog, and in their depths passed for one brief moment a look of such passionate yearning that Greystone realised for the first time the overpowering violence of a paternal love he had only suspected. A moment later and the look was gone; Sir Everett was again cool, composed, and indifferent ; but the harmony of the group was disturbed, Ruth felt an indescribable presentiment of evil, and the party broke up almost immediately. When Greystone joined Miss Barston, she looked up eagerly at him. \" What ails papa ? \" she said. \" Nothing ; do not let this little outbreak alarm you. You have nothing to apprehend for your father \u2014 nothing, I honestly assure you \" \"You hesitate. You were about to add some thing.\" \"Nothing,\" resumed Greystone, \"unless some,"], [193, "The Baronet discusses French Plays. 189 unexpected shock should destroy the self-imposed calm of his life \u2014 the existence he has chosen is the best for him \u2014 and that there is no reason for anxiety makes it a little easier for me to tell you, Ruth, that I must leave you \u2014 for a while.\" ' ' I thought you had given up all idea of return ing to Mrs. Ralph before Christmas,\" said Ruth gently. \" I am not going back to the cottage; I start for London and perhaps for Paris.\" \" London ? Paris ? Oh, surely not now,\" cried the girl, startled by the suddenness of the announcement, \" you have not had bad news, Mr. Greystone?\" \" No \u2014 and yet I must go.\" \" This is very unexpected. You cannot think of leaving the Hall \u2014 of leaving me . . . .so soon? \" \" Rest assured, my dear child, that I shall not remain away an hour more than I can help,\" he said, taking her passive hand in his. \"But how long will that be ? \" ' ' I dare not fix any time ; it may be a month , or two, perhaps more,\" he said, gravely noticing the change that had come over Ruth's face, and feeling a strange, unknown pang at the prospect of this separation, which had before appeared so natural and so imperative. He remained silent. The heavy tears started to Ruth's eyes, and she lowered her head to conceal them."], [194, "190 Doctor Greystone. When he spoke again his voice was grave with emotion. \" Did you think that this dream could last for ever, Ruth ; that I could win your love, your consent to be mine, and remain here, your father's guest, leaving him ignorant of my expectations and of the boon you have con ferred?\" Ruth sighed. \" We were very happy, Mr. Greystone, were we not ? Why disturb our peace with a new element? But,\" she added, seeing his face darken, \"you know best; speak to my father to-morrow if you please.\" \"Are you so certain of the reception I shall meet ? Are you sure that Sir Everett will not resent the presumption of a stranger suing for his daughter's hand?\" \" You are not a stranger,\" she said, softly, \"but a friend. My father likes and trusts you ; you have done him more good in six months than Dr. Leslie in a life-time. Why should he not not give you his daughter? He would not miss me,\" she added a little sadly ; \"he has Bertie.\" \" Bertie, who has no great liking for me; Bertie is proud and ambitious, and would be the first in his boyish intolerance to repudiate the idea that James Greystone, the obscure interloper, should ally himself to his ancient house.\" \" What makes you talk like this to-day?/' said Ruth earnestly and with secret misgiving. It was true ; her brother did not care for Greystone,"], [195, "The Baronet discusses French Plays. 191 was impatient of his presence, jealous of his growing influence over the Baronet, angered by his sister's evident preference for him. He had been at little pains to hide his feelings. Ruth's quiet tact had often averted outbreaks of temper, and she did not know that the young man openly expressed his irritation before Dr. Leslie and other malcontents who were leagued against the growing popularity of the Doctor. She was like wise ignorant of one or two calm but authoritative rebukes which Greystone had administered to Bertie when he had forgotten himself so far as to allow his antagonism to his father's guest to overstep the bounds of politeness. For the first time it struck her painfully that from her brother might come an unexpected danger. Seeing that Greystone did not answer, she continued hurriedly: \" Never mind Bertie, he is but a boy. Go to my father, tell him the truth \u2014 all the truth.\" \" That I love you with an honest man's honest love?\" \"Yes.\" \" And that you love me, Ruth ? \" \"Yes,\" and she placed both her hands in his, looking into his eyes with her clear, steadfast glance. \" Before I say that to Sir Everett, Ruth, I must be able to add that I have the right to claim you as my wife because I can give you a position befitting his only daughter.\""], [196, "192 Doctor Greystone. \" To be your wife is such a position,\" she said quietly. But he would not be convinced ; his manhood rebelled against a course which would lay him open to the charge of having stolen a girl's affec tions, of appearing like a nameless adventurer, availing himself of a golden opportunity. His perfect love for her, his absolute trust in her singleness of purpose, had silenced all fear of being misunderstood by her ; that same love had enough of dignity and pride to rebel against the possibility of being misjudged by others. He resisted all her tender feminine pleadings, he re mained firm in his self-imposed duty of re-edifi cating his social status for her sake, and in his heart he blessed her, because there was no doubt, no thought of herself in the gentle persuasion and loving faith that breathed through all her words. It was characteristic of her reliant nature, of her absolute surrender, that she never questioned him about his past or future ; she lived in the present, with no wish and no desire to revive a bygone time of which he was not the first to speak, or to look beyond into a future which she was to share with him. A secret instinct, perhaps, told her that as there is no per fect love without perfect confidence, sooner or later, but none the less surely, would Greystone's reserve fall and his whole life be laid bare to her, as she was willing that every act and thought of"], [197, "The Baronet discusses French Plays. 19o hers should be known to him. But in the first glow of her new-found happiness she cared for nought but him as she had learnt to love him, grave, kindly, generous, loyal, manly, the only man who had made her heart beat quicker and taught her the lesson which every woman learns once, for her felicity or her undoing. James Greystone yielded so far to Ruth's entreaties that he agreed to remain at the Hall till after Christ mas ; he made that concession when Miss Barston pleaded her anxiety about her father \u2014 the vague fears aroused by his morbid speech, and the uneasiness it would cause her to be left with out his advice during the time when Sir Everett, taking more exercise, riding out in cold weather, and shooting occasionally in his woods, was more liable to get worse. The doctor consented where the lover would have refused. In spite of the assurances given to Ruth, he had not watched the Baronet so persistently without knowing how much mischief, what a constitutional taint was hidden under the impassible exterior ; and how a violent and dangerous outbreak of latent disease might put his life, if not in actual imminent danger, yet bring on again the state of invalidism of his early youth. To obtain that he should renounce riding and shooting was out of the question ; he would never consent to so public a confession of ill health ; all that could be done was, therefore, to avert by tacit precautions the N"], [198, "Doctor Greystone. 194 evil effects of chills and fatigue on an enfeebled frame. With the beginning of the year the opportunities for field sports would diminish and Ruth's anxieties in that respect be assuaged. It was, therefore, settled that no change should be made in the respective position of the inmates of the Hall till after Christmas, and Ruth, banishing the idea of separation to come, lapped herself in the calm content of the present hour. But while Sir Everett discoursed metaphysics with his guest in serene unconsciousness of the watchful and clear-sighted care of which he was the object ; while the short winter days seemed to Ruth more full of sunshine than any summer hours she had ever spent ; while Bertie forgot his ill humour with his dogs and his guns, a cloud was slowly gathering around the Hall, threatening its peace, of which its inmates guessed neither the origin nor the growth. CHAPTER XII. DR. GREYSTONE OFFENDS PAST FORGIVENESS, AND VENGEANCE OVERTAKES HIM. The days had waned since the star of the stranger had been in the ascendant ; it had of late paled considerably, for he had sinned far more heinously and unpardonably than in that seemingly innocuous deception of erroneous identity ; and he was, so Syston felt with sharp"], [199, "Dr. Greystone Offends Past Forgiveness. 195 mortification, utterly ignorant of his crime and its censure. James Greystone had, gradually at first, then almost completely, withdrawn himself from those houses where the officious civilities had been pressed upon him, of which he had always been the most unwilling recipient. He had, at last, consistently abstained from the, to him, insufferably distasteful gatherings at Mrs. Tur ner's and at Mrs. Maltby's ; he had unmistakably shown his determination not to be advised, lion ized, or patronized by the former ; petted, fed, and amused by the second. He had irretrievably affronted both ladies by his civil but peremptory refusals, and, the more they multiplied their rival efforts to secure his presence, the more the per sistent failure of these efforts becoming palpable to the whole of their little world, turned to gall the selfish liking he had inspired. Had Mr.' Greystone left the neighbourhood without a word or expectation of return, his fair fame would have remained in hands interested to uphold it, at least as long as his memory re mained alive ; but he had presumed to stay among them, and transfer his allegiance ; he had not only seceded, but joined another camp ; he had carried his sycophantic partisanship at the feet of the magnates of Syston, and flaunted his in timacy with the Barstons. The Hall in its arrogance, not content with signalling him out for adoption, had removed him from the sphere"], [200, "196 Doctor Greystone. to which he belonged by pre-emption ; and he had, in his ingratitude, renounced his first friends, his kind patrons. They would have tolerated a restricted, deferential intercourse with the Baronet, looking upon it as a recognition of their own appreciation ; but was it to be endured that he, the alien, the unknown lodger of Mrs. Ralph, the wanderer whom they had taken by the hand, for whom they had built a history, to whom they had given the freedom of their homes, of whose indebtedness they had boasted, whose attentions to their daughters they had hinted at \u2014 was it to be permitted that he should, unpunished, shake off the bonds they had deemed so secure, throw back at them the favours they esteemed so precious, humiliate them by his apo3tacy, and use his independence to become the inseparable companion of the very people with whom they had never achieved more than a frigid acquaint ance? No; neither Mrs. Turner nor Mrs. Maltby would sit down calmly under this affront, and both swore to be avenged. They began to hate him with all the bitterness of foiled hopes. Barbara Maltby could not forgive Greystone for having remained callous to the charms of her four unmarried daughters ; nor Mrs. Turner that he should have resisted her blandishments, and refused to be a captive in her much vaunted salon. His absolute unconsciousness of this revolution"], [201, "Dr. Greystone Offends Past Forgiveness. 197 in their feelings towards him only fanned the flame of ill-will. He became the object of a systematic persecution, wily and perfidious from Mrs. Turner ; abusive and violent from Mrs. Maltby. An open attack was imminent ; the belligerents only waited for a favourable oppor tunity to unmask their batteries, and they had not long to wait. Towards the beginning of December, a sudden sharp frost brought the hunting in Leicester- shire to an abrupt standstill, and had a disastrous effect on the temper of the hunting men, who forthwith became a burden to themselves and their families. Mr. Maltby, who was never en- tirely happy except in the saddle, was so far ruffled, in spite of his usually placid disposition, that he ventured to oppose an autocratic and unjust dismissal of the butler for a trifling dereliction. Robinson happened to be a great expert in hunting things, and was a favourite with his master ; but he was apt to break through the stringent rules, enforced by his mistress, in the pantry ; hence he had received notice to leave. Mrs. Maltby, incensed by Mr. Grey- stone's defection, and goaded by Mrs. Turner, had been for some time in a state of nervous ex- asperation which boded no good to the household, and which vented itself by a sharper supervision of her servants, continual fault-finding, and un bridled intemperance of tongue. She bitterly"], [202, "198 Doctor Greystone. resented her husband's imprudent interference in the matter of Robinson's dismissal, and the un happy Fred drew upon himself no small share of vituperation, in the midst of which Mrs. Maltby herself gave him a loophole of escape, of which he promptly availed himself. \" There is no fool like an old fool,\" she said to him in conclusion, \" and to see a great big man, the father of six grown-up children, sit by the fire nursing his knees, and talking of what he don't understand, just because the ground is hard and he can't bestride a good-for-nothing brute that eats its head off, and run with a parcel of other idiots in red coats after a stalled deer, is enough to make a saint swear.\" \" I thought, Barbara, we had agreed to let the horses, the hunters, and the hunting out of the question,\" observed Mr. Maltby. \" As to Robinson,\" resumed Mrs. Maltby, ignoring the remark, \" either he or I go. I will not be bearded in my house, and I know what's what, if others don't. I shall not have the best tea service left out at night, and the handles of the knives soaking in boiling water, not for any butler that ever breathed. I don't care a snap for your breeches and boots ; but I will have my rules obeyed. If you must have a man who wastes half his time for six months pipeclaying and polishing your ridiculous toggery, why don't you run up to London and see about one? They"], [203, "Dr. Greystone Offends Past Forgiveness. 199 won't drop down from the clouds, and you may as well bestir yourself for once in your life.\" \" I am perfectly willing, if you say so,\" put in Mr. Maltby, with suspicious alacrity. London had allurements which the breezy temperature of the domestic circle did not possess. \" You must not stay dawdling here; the sooner you start the better. But mind you, Fred, don't take the first simpleton that offers just to save yourself a little trouble ; and remember he must be married, steady, sober, clean, and have at least a year's personal character ; and I say, Fred, not a penny more than forty pounds a year will I give, without beer, and no perquisites.\" \" I know, I know,\" replied Mr. Maltby, who had the catalogue of the butler's duties and the programme of his necessary qualifications at his fingers' end from long experience and frequent changes. \" I know, and, moreover, when I see a fellow likely to suit, I'll send him down for you to look at and decide.\" \" Of course. I wouldn't trust to your judgment on anything that isn't horseflesh, and hardly that. Here is the time-table. Catch the first train, I advise you. You won't find your precious Robinson here when you return, depend upon it.\" Mr. Maltby, having consulted the glass and seen no immediate prospect of a thaw, started for London that same afternoon, and contrived to"], [204, "200 Doctor Greystone. extend his search for a paragon butler over three whole days. As in duty bound, he visited the offices of the firm of which he had once been a partner, and in whose affairs he still had a vicarious interest. He was at once taken to the private room of his elder brother, John Maltby, now head of the concern, and received with much warmth. \"By Jove, Fred,\" said the senior partner, \"you are the very man I want. I was just going to drop you a line, but this suits me much better.\" \" What's up now ? \" said Mr. Maltby, lighting a cigar. \"Well, just this. Burbidge and Lincoln, of Shrewsbury \u2014 you know them \u2014 solicitors to half the county, have written us to make inquiries in London and Paris anent a person who comes in for a legacy. A certain Tabitha Bertall, spinster, lately deceased in that town, has left a will, dated some fifteen years back, by which she bequeathes two thousand pounds to her younger brother, Thomas Bertall. Now it appears that Thomas Bertall, a queer sort of fellow, died in Paris, leaving an only daughter, Grace, who of course inherits in her father's stead. We have already ascertained that the girl married hurriedly after her father's death, and died herself under suspicious circumstances.\" '\u25a0' How the deuce can I assist you, my good"], [205, "Dr. Greystone Offends Past Forgiveness. 201 fellow ? Since I have cut the office I have not turned detective.\" \"Let me proceed. Grace Bertall's husband was a doctor, a certain James Greystone, who lest Paris suddenly and has not been heard of since. Ha ! I see by your face that you begin to follow me. Barbara or one of your girls casually men tioned in their letters to my wife or their cousins that a Mr. Greystone has settled at Syston. The coincidence of the name with that of Burbidge and Lincoln's client suddenly occurred to me, and I want you to tell us or find out for us who the man is, and if he is likely to be Grace Bertall's husband.\" \" Upon my word, there isn't much to tell. Our Grey'stone seems harmless enough, and is not addicted to talking about himself. When he first came to Syston, let me see, a year ago, I should say, he didn't look as if he meant to settle down, but the women took him up, the girls petted him, and between you and me I suspect there is some thing brewing between him and our Squire's daughter, Miss Barston.\" \" I am sorry to hear it, if he is our man. To begin with, is he a doctor? \" \"He doesn't call himself one, but he does a good deal of promiscuous physicking all over the place. The poor people swear by him, and our local doctor hates him accordingly.\" The elder Maltby stroked his chin and pursued ;"], [206, "202 Doctor Greystone. \" Has he ever mentioned living abroad, or being a widower? \" \" Not that I am aware of.

Where she got her information, I am not prepared to say, and between you and me the good lady is addicted to drawing freely on her imagination. But what were the suspicious circumstances you alluded to?\" \" Well, my Doctor Greystone came unawares upon his wife at a time when he was not expected, and took the law into his own hands. The lover escaped, but the woman, Grace Bertall, died under his avenging hand, or something to that effect.\" \" Wheugh ! \" said Mr. Maltby, with bis low, suppressed whistle, \" that is ugly enough so far. Was there a trial?\" \" A preliminary inquest, I believe. One of those private inquiries that in France take the place of a regular prosecution.

There is some awkwardness about him already, and the women will all be set cackling.\" Mr. Maltby formed a resolution not to reveal this little episode to his better half, for he had a man's horror of his wife's constant petty social"], [208, "204 Doctor Greystone. squabbles, and dismissed the subject from his mind. He treated himself to club dinners, frequented the theatres least approved of by his Barbara, drove a smart bargain for an extra hunter with a well-known horse dealer, selected a butler, sent him to Mile End Villa on approval, and at the close of the third day, when the frost gave evidence of breaking, returned to the bosom of his family, much refreshed by his short holiday. The fates decreed that Mr. Maltby's wise intentions of discretion should be foiled. Barbara, still in an impracticable mood, scouted the bare notion of engaging the servant of her husband's choice, and taunted him acrimoniously with his want of discernment. \" Any one but you would see with half-an-eye that the man is a dolt and an idiot. You would allow yourself to be imposed upon by the most glaring fraud. Now I only want to look at a face once and I am never deceived.\" Even the worm will turn, even the docile hus band will rebel. Mr. Maltby would have accepted Barbara's openly expressed contempt of his dis criminating powers, but he resented her vain glorious self-praise. \" You have made a mistake once or twice though, Barbara,\" he said significantly. \" Never.\" \"What ? not in the case of the Reverend Bartholomew Featherston ?

Mrs. Maltby fired up instantly : \" How dare you mention that wretched sneaking Jesuit, that fiend in a cassock, that wolf in sheep's clothing, that serpent who turned against the hand that fed it ? I thank Heaven that the vile hypocrite did not marry a child of mine. Had I been a man,\" she continued with scorch ing emphasis, \" I should have horsewhipped him before the whole congregation.\" \"You scourged him, Barbara, with your tongue,\" said Mr. Maltby, who repented himself of his imprudent reminiscences ; and, dreading one of the outbursts that had in former days interfered with his beauty sleep, he attempted to divert his wife's mind, and in his eagerness stumbling upon the very topic he had decided not to broach to her, hurriedly continued, \"Anyhow, let us not go over that ground again, Bab ; I have heard a piece of news in London, about another of your friends, Greystone.\" In her acrimonious state of feeling against her whilom protege, Mrs. Maltby's interest was at once enlisted, and the very guarded outline of the story related by John Maltby filled her with such evident satisfaction, that she forgave her husband on the spot, and plied him with a minute interro-"], [210, "206 Doctor Greystone, gatory. The answers she elicited being sufficient to enable her to build up a damning scandal, she paid no heed to Maltby's repeated caution against disseminating what might prove, aster all, an unsupported accusation. Before twenty-four hours had elapsed, Mrs. Turner was in possession of certain important facts, and had enriched them with additional coherence and circumstantial evidence of her own finding. Mr. Greystone had been implicated in a sensational and conjugal adventure. That was enough. On this slight canvas she embroidered a story, which a day later she allowed all her acquaintances to tear from her, and, by stringent appeals to their discretion, contrived to have widely circulated. Reluctantly she seemed to admit that Mr. Greystone was dangerous ; she had it not in her power to disprove that Mr. Greystone had been in jail ; the culpable leniency of the French law, as lax as the honour of French women, had condoned a murder. Yes ; Mr. Greystone had taken the life of a wretched creature he had called his wife. Perhaps she had not even been that when he tired of her ; and Mr. Greystone, escaping from justice, had hidden in his native land under an assumed name. With some discrepancies and a few flaws, which con stant iteration would soon remedy, the story was as plausible, as wicked, as shameful as a woman's"], [211, "Dr. Greystone Offends Past Forgiveness. 207 ingenuity could devise it, consequently univer sally credited. Mrs. Maltby was at first somewhat uneasy at the proportions her revelations had taken, and, being a little afraid of her husband's anger, would gladly have withdrawn them, but, as that was impossible, and as providentially Fred was entirely taken up with his hunting, she gradually reconciled herself to her indiscretion, and even gloried in the part she played of avenging her mortification and wounded vanity on the offender. Mrs. Turner, whose pique was deeper, whose irritation was more dangerous, lost no opportunity of fanning Mrs. Maltby's revengeful ire, and of persuading her that, as she had originally intro duced the reprobate into her sheepfold, it was for her to publicly chastise his treachery. The man ner of that chastisement was not easy to settle. Neither of the two allies could openly cut Dr. Greystone, as he gave them no opportunity to do so ; they could not rescind any invitations, as they had constantly of late been met by refusals ; they could not send doughty champions to heap contumely on his head, as they instinctively felt that men would not espouse their quarrel to that extent ; nor could they, not, however, from want of courage or purpose, attack him face to face in Mrs. Ralph's cottage, for he was altogether at the Hall, and secure in the serene indifference of his hosts to local gossip."], [212, "208 Doctor Greystone. While the uncertainty of vengeance lasted, while the indignation was at fever heat, and Mrs. Turner and Mrs. Maltby met daily in verbose and malevolent conclave, Carrie burst in one morning upon the two Rhadamantine ladies, with her handsome face beaming with good nature and excitement. \" Stay your wrath,\" she said rapidly. \" I vote you leave the poor man alone. I knew all along it was nothing but a mare's nest. If a monster in Paris murdered his wife and made mincemeat of her, we can't help it, only why should it be that dear, good, excellent, tiresome Mr. Grey stone ? You can't prove that it is, and I can prove that it is not,\" she continued trium phantly. \" Oh, indeed ! \" said Mrs. Turner, pale at the thought that the girl really had it in her power to annihilate her vindictive theory. \" I am sure I hope so ; but we should like to hear your grounds for this consoling assertion before we credit it absolutely.\" \"Well, then, he is \u2014 can't you guess? \u2014 he is engaged to Ruth Barston.\" \" Impossible ! \" cried both mothers, equally incensed and equally determined that he should rue for this additional crime, and, at the same time, contemptuously incredulous. \" But he is, I tell you.\" \" Has this grievous and melancholy engage-"], [213, "Dr. Greystone Offends Past Forgiveness. 209 nient been made fatally public?\" said Mrs, Turner, with deep concern. \"Well, no ; it is not given out and all that,\" admitted Carrie, \" but I am as sure of it as if it was. I have just seen Ruth in the village, and I began chaffing her about Mr. Greystone and his unmistakable attentions. I called her Una and the bear \u2014 I mean, the lion.\" \" The viper ! \" interpolated Mrs. Maltby. \" Well, then, she smiled a little, as if to herself, and looked so young and pretty I could have hugged her then and there. Then she blushed more like an ordinary girl than ever I saw her look before. Dear Ruth, I love her! \" said Carrie, whose friendships were vehement and ecstatic. \"I do not see marriage in all that,\" said Mrs. Turner, unpleasantly. \" Oh, Mrs. Turner, you should have heard Ruth as she said in her sweet, prim, soft voice, with quite a tender, happy ring in it : ' My dear, don't talk like that about Mr. Greystone and me; please don't, Carrie ; it pains me noiv,' and the way that ' now ' came out was as good as an engagement ring on her finger or banns in the church. She loves him, he loves her ; they'll make a match of it, I bet, whether the old mummified Baronet likes it or not.

For the present,\" she continued, glancing at Mrs. Maltby*, \" I shall not allow Miss Barston to come near Selina ; I wish to keep the child un tainted, and her ears unpolluted by the recital of secret entanglements with a suspicious character. Of course, I do not wish to dictate to your dear mother, who must judge for herself, and leave you free to associate with this misguided young woman.\" \" Ruth is my best friend, Mrs. Turner,\" said Carrie, defiantly; \"and I shall always be proud of knowing her \u2014 and see as much of her as she will let me.\" \" Indeed, you will do nothing of the kind, Carrie,\" said Mrs. Maltby, quailing under Mrs. Turner's imperious eye. \" From this hour, you and your sisters have no intercourse whatever with Ruth Barston.\" \" Good heavens, mother ! what do you mean?"], [216, "212 Doctor Greystone.

I shall speak to your father, and he will lay his commands on you.\" By this, Carrie knew there would be no possible appeal. \"Now go to your room, and find out who is mis tress here.\" The girl shrugged her shoulders, but retired without further protest. Only she at once scrawled a breathless, unintelligible note to her friend, and sent it to the Hall by the baker's boy, a proceeding which combined devotion to friend ship with a tacit disobedience to maternal dictates. The note ran thus : \"My darling, \u2014 There's mischief brewing. Stick to him if they all hound him \u2014 never mind it \u2014 or them.

The informa tion I have received, and which I have laid before you, is such that no decent house in England will remain open to that man, Greystone, and it is fit that, whether or not his antecedents are known to Miss Barston, you should take prompt steps to banish the miscreant from your roof.\" A dangerous glitter in Sir Everett's cold blue eyes ought to have warned Mrs. Maltby that she was presuming too far. In vain had the Baronet tried to interrupt her long and diffuse defamation ; but, finding it impossible, he had suffered her to proceed, leaning back in his chair, the tips of his fingers meeting, careless to conceal his dis pleasure at her intrusion. But, when the im prudent matron forgot herself so far as to advise and dictate, he literally gasped with astonishment, and the audacity of her interference robbed him for a moment of speech. He had been provoked by a statement which he was unprepared to meet or deny, and was indignant at the impertinence of his visitor ; it is doubtful whether at any time"], [219, "Mrs. Maltby as Nemesis. 215 he would have submitted to having his opinion questioned and his judgment shaken by any rumours tending to invalidate his perspicacity; but it was enough that Mrs. Maltby should arraign his wisdom in the choice of his guest for him to refute her with inexorable obstinacy. Ab horring anything that resembled interference, and roused to anger by her last words, he cast upon the heated, loud-voiced woman a withering glance, and then spoke in his coolest, stateliest, most incisive accent : \"I regret, Mrs. Maltby, that you should have taken the trouble to seek me on such an errand, as I am not prepared to make any changes in my associations for groundless aspersions coming from sources unacknowledged by me. I may also add, that I consider myself a competent judge in the management of my affairs, the direction of my household, and the choice of my guests ; I must therefore gratefully decline any interference, however well meant. Had I not the honour of speaking to a lady, I should say that I never tolerate any such uncalled-for interference ; as it is, I trust your double mistake may not be re peated.\" Mrs. Maltby, who boasted that she had never been foiled in a verbal encounter with any human being, responded to this courteous satire with ill suppressed fury. \"I should have thought that Sir Everett"], [220, "216 Doctor Greystone. Barston had the honour of his name too much at heart to permit his daughter to marry a convict, and thus close upon herself every respectable house in the neighbourhood.\" At this insult, Sir Everett rose.

He looked at her with con temptuous scorn, as he said slowly \u2014 \" Miss Barston's prospects are not under dis cussion, madam, and her name shall not be pro\" nounced in my presence, save as becomes that of a gentlewoman. I beg of you to allude neither to her, nor to Mr. Greystone, except in such terms as I can listen to as her father and his friend ! \" As he spoke, he moved towards the bell, and touched it. An awkward pause followed. Mrs. Maltby felt herself routed and dismissed ; she could have carried on a war of words : this proud self-possession awed her into silence. She rose, flushed and flurried. Without again looking at her, Sir Everett said quietly : \" May I order your carriage ? \" And gave the necessary instruction to the footman who answered his summons. Nothing was left for Mrs. Maltby but to make an undignified ex t, and to retire, routed and pro portiona ely furious. \"With a pardonable want of accuiac) , she, howe\\er, managed to give a suf ficiently7 garbled account of her mission to impress her expectant listeners at home with the con viction that it had terminated in the Baronets'"], [221, "Mrs. Maltby as Nemesis. 217 discomfiture. Mrs. Turner shrewdly suspected the truth from her friend's confidential admissions, and the wrath of both ladies waxed more bitter and vindictive still. Sir Everett, who abhorred scenes and ex planations, had acquired a faculty of dismissing unpleasant subjects which, in the present occur rence, stood him in good need. Greystone was a useful commensal, and an interesting com panion ; as long as he continued so, it mattered little to him what his former history had been. His paternal watchfulness, as far as his daughter was concerned, had not enough solicitude to make him mindful of any complication that might arise from the continued presence of the agreeable stranger. The possibility of Ruth's marrying had always been a hazy one ; the probability of her loving or selecting a husband for herself had never entered his mind. She was a mute portion of his existence ; a silent factor in his household ; he credited her with as little volition or purpose as he had ever permitted her to exercise. Change of any sort being antagonistic to his misanthropic and selfish conceptions of personal comfort, he did not contemplate the chance of an alteration in his daughter's prospects which would indirectly affect his own. Her personality was subservient to his ; her individuality entirely merged in the engrossing routine of his existence. To do him justice, he had an instinctive confidence in Ruth's"], [222, "Doctor Greystone. 218 purity and proper feeling, her inability to act in an unfeminine manner, go that, had he even been more interested in her welfare, he would have scorned the idea of watching or doubting her. On the other hand,- he unconsciously* disbelieved the truth of the tale unfolded to him by Mrs. Maltby ; her exaggerations, inconsistency, and violence marred the effect of her revelations, and Sir Everett, in spite of his constant self-contem plation, had sufficient perspicuity and knowledge of human nature to gauge the worth of certain malicious statements. The inexcusable attack upon Ruth had only corroborated the belief that he had been made the recipient of a mischievous fabrication ; hence he received Mr. Grey*stone on his return from his walk with exactly the same warmth and courtesy as of yore. So far, then, the campaign directed against the Doctor had been sterile ; but, unfortunately, three days later, he received the ambiguous letter indited by Messrs. Bembridge and Lincoln, and suddenly left Syston for Shrewsbury, without even telling the Barstons where he was going. This abrupt departure left the field clear for his enemies. Ruth was not long to remain in ignorance of the rumours affecting the honour of the man she loved. During his momentary absence she beguiled the hours by resuming some of her former habits, and was more frequently seen in"], [223, "Mrs. Maltby as Nemesis. 219 and about Syston. \\ Carrie, coming across her alone and unawares, followed up the mysterious warning contained in her note by an equally startling communication. She informed her friend, in broken, tearful accents, of the veto placed on their free intercourse ; of the attacks made on Mr. Greystone; of her mother's visit to the Hall, and that, considering herself insulted by Sir Everett, Mrs. Maltby was unsparing in her denunciations. Miss Barston's gentle nature was roused out of its quiescent serenity by this confession. She proudly drew herself up, and, while accepting Mrs. Maltby's decision with dignified indiffer ence, she gave an earnest, scornful denial to the vile slander, and added that she considered her self honoured by Mr. Greystone's friendship.' As she learnt through her friend that Sir Everett had declined to alter his behaviour to his guest, she experienced for her father an almost rever ential gratitude. She parted from Carrie with kind and gentle injunctions to submit to her parent's commands, unjust and cruel as they were, and firmly resisted any suggestions of stolen interviews. \"I do not doubt your loyalty, Carrie,\" she said ; \" and if you wish to prove your friendship to me, do so by emphatically refusing to credit one word spoken against Mr. Greystone.\" But from that day, wherever she went, Miss"], [224, "\u25a0220 Doctor Greystone. Barston was conscious of disquieting, openly voiced, or stealthily-whispered reports ; and in some occult fashion she knew that her name was coupled with that of James Greystone. In his protracted absence she was powerless to defend him ; her indignant protests were met with a silence more damning than words, or, worse still, with a dubious smile that implied a belief in her com plicity. After a while the atmosphere of suspicion and malignity in which she moved became intolerable to her. She had not the strength to cope alone with the general enmity. While she longed for her lover's return, she dreaded having to confront him with so monstrous an accusation. It seemed to her faith almost an outrage to place him in an attitude of defence \u2014 of requiring him to plead innocent before her ; and yet the slow poison of a nameless uneasiness was slowly filtering into her soul, although she knew it not. Had anyone hinted that she could suspect Greystone of being other than an upright, blameless, honourable man, she would have repudiated the insinuation with utter contempt ; but in the innermost recesses of her heart crept the longing to have, like other girls in her position, known more of the past of the man she loved. She wondered vaguely at his reticence ; she no longer remained indifferent to that former existence in which she had had no share; she felt an irritation akin to pain when"], [225, "Mrs. Maltby as Nemesis. 221 she remembered that his persistent silence about himself robbed her of the ability to stand up as his advocate. Had he been confiding and quite frank with her, he would unwittingly have placed in her hands the surest weapons against his enemies. But what did she know ? Nothing. It mattered little now that she had never cared to inquire : her past reserve filled her with a strange impatience. She could no longer persevere in it. The questions which would have come so naturally before from her loving lips would now assume in her own eyes \u2014 in his, perhaps \u2014 the character of an interrogatory. She must either reveal the infamous charge brought against him, or suffer him to remain in ignorance, and in her turn be wanting in loyalty and frankness. Either course was inexpressibly repugnant to her, for, whichever way she acted, whether she stood before him voicing a cruel accusation, or per mitted its baleful influence to spread unknown to him, she felt that her love, her trust, was in some inexplicable way debased, and she a traitor. The unfortunate absence of Mr. Greystone coinciding so fatally with the explosion of the bombshell that threatened his honour was inter preted most unfavourably in Syston, and con sidered as an admission of guilt, and a flight before its consequences. When this last judg ment came to Ruth's knowledge, Mrs. Turner being her informant, she hesitated no longer."], [226, "222 Doctor Greystone. She nerved herself to the unprecedented measure of questioning her father on a subject he had not been the first to broach. Seeking the Baronet in his library, she told him in a few brief sentences, rendered tremulous by excitement, in what terms Mr. Greystone was spoken of by people who called themselves friends of the Barstons, and who had extended to him the hand of good fellowship. Poor Ruth chose an inopportune moment. Bertie had forestalled her. He, too, had heard the rumours from Dr. Leslie, and in a fit of boyish passion he had reproached his father with his imprudence in receiving a fellow who was black guarded all over the place. \" It is a shame that I should have to be civil to him in my own house,\" he had added, with lofty scorn. This last speech angered the Baronet. Even his favourite son must not forget the deference due to his superior wisdom, and the young man had left the room in high dudgeon when he had been curtly reminded that the Hall was not his house, but Sir Everett's, saying \u2014 - \" Very well; please yourself at home, father ; but I shall please myself about this acquaintance out of it.\" Vexed with the displeasure of Bertie, fearful of a public outburst on the boy's part, which would have endangered his policy of abstention, anxious"], [227, "Mrs. Maltby as Nemesis. 223 to appease him without compromising his own dignity, he was ill-disposed to have the subject which had caused their disagreement brought up again. Ruth pleaded to know what course to pursue, and begged for his advice and assistance with an earnestness that surprised and irritated her father. \" I wonder,\" he said icily, \" that you should have allowed yourself to be mixed up with the low gossip of the neighbourhood, but, having done so, I wonder still more, Ruth, that you should so far forget yourself as to drag me into it. I decline to be made a party to slander and libel.\" \"But, papa, as it is slander and libel,\" urged the girl, \"you will not let Mr, Greystone be insulted without standing up for him?\" \" I consider this step unnecessary \u2014 nay, imperti nent. I am in no position to make myself Mr. Greystone's defender. He is my guest ; this is sufficient refutation on my part, I presume,\" said the Baronet, not without a certain dignity, for he had the instincts of a gentleman, and his polished egotism hardly ever clashed with the traditions of his race. \"Will it be sufficient for Mr. Greystone?\" answered Ruth, marvelling at her own boldness. \" Will he not have the right to tax us with treachery when he learns that we take no active measures to clear his honour ? \" \" A man's honour, Ruth, is neither tainted nor"], [228, "224 Doctor Greystone. cleared by mere talk. Greystone has no more the right to judge our attitude than we have to judge his. As long as my manner to. him remains un changed, the rest is no business of his, as far as we are concerned.\" \" If he does not even know the horrible things said of him, how can he disculpate himself ? \" \"Tut, tut, my dear girl; better for him to remain in ignorance. Had you not tolerated the gossip, you would have spared yourself and me this unpleasant complication.\" \" But surely, papa, he should be warned. He must know; someone must tell him. It is monstrous that such stories, such lies, should be circulated against an honourable gentleman, and he remain the only one in ignorance. I cannot bear it.\" \"You agitate yourself unduly, Ruth. This exaggerated partisanship is unbecoming and unwarranted. I do not admit that my daughter has any call to vindicate my friends any more than she has justification in encouraging libellous and insolent gossip about them.\" \" Papa- \u2014 \" Enough. This discussion can be of no possible advantage save one. It gives me the opportunity of insisting that as long as I choose to receive Mr. Greystone as my guest you shall neither by word or look appear cognizant of these rumours, nor let him suspect that any are afloat.\" The Baronet, foreseeing how an eclat of any"], [229, "Mrs. Maltby as Nemesis. 225 kind would mar the peaceful enjoyment of his intercourse with the accused man, determined to put off the evil hour, or at least not to hasten it by any Quixotic act. Noticing the imploring, deprecating look in his daughter's tearful eyes, he added, with the cold, peremptory severity before which she had succumbed since babyhood, \" You will be pleased to remember that I forbid it, formally forbid it, and that I am not tolerant of disobedience to my orders.\" Ruth bowed her head to hide the dropping tears, and moved silently towards the door. Her heart smote her for her cowardice, but the habit of sub mission was strong upon her, and experience had taught her long since how futile was resistance. As she was about to leave the room Sir Everett called her. \" Ruth,\" he said, in an artificial voice, meant to convey how entirely he had dismissed the former subject, \" Ruth, find Bertie, and do not let him go off with a nonsensical idea that I am offended with him. The boy's heart is in the right place, and, forsooth, at seventeen he thinks himself old enough to choose his own friends. Only he mustn't meddle with mine. And, Ruth, just ask him to go round to Churton's and tell him we must have a morning in the river-copse to-morrow.'' Ruth tinned a little anxiously. \"Are you going to shoot also, papa?\" she said. \"The"], [230, "226 Doctor Greystone, ground is very damp down by the river, and you have not been quite so well all last week.\" \" Pshaw, Ruth, I am not an invalid. I shall most certainly take a gun and potter round with Bertie. Besides, the boy is wild about some otters he wants to hunt. I have refused him twice this week to see the spot. Tell him to settle with Churton, and take no other engage ments.\" Ruth left her father without another word ; a great weary desolation possessed her. While her heart was full of love, pity, and yearning for James Greystone, while a man's honour, a girl's fate were in jeopardy, her father had thought only for the caprices of his handsome, wayward, spoilt boy. CHAPTER XIV. \"who did this thing?\" That same evening, James Greystone returned to the Hall. As he and Ruth met ; each thought the other inexplicably7 altered. Greystone seemed older, more careworn. He had not with impunity been snatched from the calm serenity and hopefulness of his love to be confronted, through the cold, scrutinising medium of the law, with the troubled times of his luck less marriage. The one irretrievable error of his former life, which he believed buried under his"], [231, "\" Who Did this Thing >\" 227 pardon and silence, cropped up once more to disturb his recently-acquired peace. The dead woman, guilty or not, rose from her forgotten grave to dispel the mystery in which he had shrouded the record of their brief married life ; and testified against the reticence that had, with unconscious cowardice, not yet laid bare before the girl he courted the sombre loosening of the ties which bound him to the woman he had wedded. The blindness of a man's first engros sing passion had cast the pall of oblivion over that earlier union, contracted in an hour of pity, of weakness, of careless compassion. In the same spirit of shamed impatience that had driven him from the spot where Grace Bertall had met her doom, to banish her memory, and deaden his wrath, he had at last succeeded in casting aside the shadow of that domestic drama, and had basked in the sunlight of a purer, nobler, stronger affection, without asking himself how much of that past secret he had a right to withhold. Not with remorse, reproach, or craving for pardon had the phantom of Grace Bertall risen before him. She had come with money in her hand, with a legacy that her death alone could place in his. For that contemptible object had the grave opened ; for that had she again stood before the world as his wife ; for that did she place herself between him and his pure young bride, asserting her prior claim to James"], [232, "Doctor Greystone. 228 Greystone's legitimate affections. What mattered it that, while acknowledging his marriage to the solicitors, he had firmly and scornfully declined to touch even a fraction of the sum that accrued to him through Grace's demise ? The guarded inquiries of Mr. Bembridge, the observant glances of Mr. Lincoln, warned him sufficiently that both men, before thu6 trying their direct appeal to him, had searched the annals of the Paris days. How much had they ascertained ? How far were they cognizant of that dark story of infidelity and betrayal, with its fatal consequences alike to the innocent and the guilty? He had not stopped to ascertain. It was enough that once more he stood before the world with that stigma from which his sensitive honour had shrank with invincible loathing, Five years of isolation and wanderings were tided over in one hour. It might have been only the morrow of the catastrophe of the Rue du Cherche Midi. And, more cruel complication yet, he had lost the power of being the one to' brave voluntarily the curiosity and questionings of society, to be the first to assert his right to re enter it unblemished and unsuspected. A critical light had searched his obscurity, and when he emerged from it finally, it would no longer seem a spontaneous act of his own, but the compulsory one of a man whose retreat is discovered. With an uneasy consciousness, it had already"], [233, "\" Who Did this Thing ? \" 229 appeared to him that, at the station at Syston j during his hurried call at Mrs. Ralph's cottage) in his passage through the streets and lanes on his way to the Hall, he had been looked at strangely. The few people he met had turned aside embarrassed or preoccupied, and he had an unacknowledged sense of being at once avoided and an object of curiosity. Bertie, who had crossed his path near one of the lodges of Barston Park, had whistled to his dogs, and, with his hands in his pockets and his hat pulled over his eyes, had gone by without a word or nod of recognition, purposely or by accident he could not tell. True, Sir Everett's reception of him had been markedly cordial for one so undemonstrative. The Baronet had been unusually cheerful and talkative at dinner, and had even hurried Grey- stone from the table, to make him examine in the library a batch of new books just arrived from London. But the deep flush on Ruth's cheek as he pressed her hand with all a lover's fervour was not the quick, rosy brightening of colour that he had learned to look for whenever he approached her ; the eyes that were lifted to his had not the clear, steadfast restfulness that he loved so well ; in their troubled depths lurked an appeal, tender no doubt, but questioning and sad. He had had no chance of seeing her alone that evening, and in his new nervousness he fancied"], [234, "230 Doctor Greystone. that Ruth had made no effort to secure the oppor tunity of exchanging a few private words with him. He could not tell in what the changed atmosphere of the Hall lay ; it took no tangible form, but it affected him with the certainty of its existence. Miss Barston, in the same occult fashion, felt that the journey, which when he started had only had for her the significance of a short separation, was fraught for her lover with some mysterious import, and was connected, she knew not how, with the mysterious imputations directed against him. Bound as she was by her father's commands, she saw no possible issue to this painful, jarring misunderstanding. James Greystone, wrapt as he had been in one absorbing study, dead too long to human sympa thies, engrossed by a morbid consciousness, was, however, at heart neither a coward nor an egotist. Inured to the sight of every possible form of suffering, he became suddenly aware that there are wounds which the surgeon's knife cannot proble, which the physician's hand cannot heal. With the new divination of sincere love, he guessed what the grief of the young girl would be when he disclosed to her the lamentable story of his first marriage ; he felt with almost feminine pre science that some whiteness, some pure intan gible bloom would fade out of her innocent trust ful love. It was his cruel task to alarm her confidence, to teach her to doubt, to open her"], [235, "\"Who Did this Thing.'\" 231 eyes to the fact that he had been \u2014 acquitted, it is true \u2014 but suspected ; that the hand into which she had placed her spotless one had been, if for one moment only, credited with a dastardly act. He would have to hint at trea chery and shame. She would pity, comfort, exonerate him ; his faith in her was strong enough to believe that ; but in her candid uprightness she would wonder that the avowal came so late, and, worse still, grieve mutely that his past held so dire a secret. And yet there was no alternative. She must be told \u2014 he must say all : his youth, his vocation, his early success, his wilful ignorance and un comprehension of every feeling not belonging to the advancement of science ; his entering into a life-long compact with Grace Bertall, in which both had been unfaithful to their pact, she in fidelity, he in guardianship, ending with her sudden death. Would she absolve him, as the Juge d 'Instruction had done, or would the girl he loved be more severe than the magistrate ? James Greystone, facing what was before him, sighed deeply, but never wavered. To-morrow at latest he would have spoken, first to Ruth, then to her father. He could no longer delay, no longer allow his pride to wait till he had achieved his worldly rehabilitation. He should meet the Baronet and his daughter, such as he Was at the present hour, and \u2014 galling thought\u2014"], [236, "232 Doctor Greystone. he judged not as he would undoubtedly have been in a few short months, but on the sole facts of the past ; they would see in him not the prosperous, celebrated physician, but the wanderer with the tarnished name, the husband once accused of slaying his wife, the man who in morbid and cul pable sensitiveness had fled from the shadow of suspicion and, like a criminal, buried four years of his life. On the following day the morning heralded itself with unwonted splendour. December had suddenly lifted its shroud of fog and stayed the moisture of its lowering skies ; the rare but brilliant winter's sun gave a ruddy life to the bare dead branches of the trees, and lit up with a merry sparkle the sombre pools and the sullen meres. The white balustrades of the terraces glistened, casting well-defined shadows on the smooth gravel ; the heavy stacks of chimneys profiled themselves sharply against the pale blue of the sky ; low-lying pearl-grey clouds belted the horizon, melting into the shadowy mists that slowly rose above the river and lake far down in the low-lying grounds. About noon Bertie was impa tiently pacing the gravel walk before the porch, followed by his dog ; Churton stood a few yards farther, with another retriever, and a couple of guns slung across his shoulder, conversing with Dr. Greystone, who was inquiring kindly after his little son. Ruth was nowhere visible. The three"], [237, "\"Who Did this Thing?\" 233 men were waiting for the Baronet, who shortly made his appearance, carrying a rifle and fully equipped. Bertie immediately went up to him. \"That's right, father \u2014 you look ripping. I am glad you have net been persuaded out of our morning's sport,\" he added with a sidelong glance of irritation at Greystone. \" It is a jolly day \u2014 quite tip-top \u2014 more like April than December.\" \" I have my star of Austerlitz, Bertie \u2014 my Queen's weather,\" said the Baronet, smiling back at the eager, handsome face of the youth. \"Where is Ruth? She sneaked off after breakfast and has not been seen since. I thought she was coming down with us. Anyhow, don't let us wait for her.\" \" Your sister left word that she would meet us with the luncheon at the Hut, on her way from the cottage. She is gone off to see Mrs. Churton and her boy, I fancy,\" carelessly explained the Baronet ; then turning to his guest : \" How so : neither gaitered nor armed, Greystone ? What are you waiting for ? \" Dr. Greystone had intended staying at the Hall, in the hope of having the eventful interview with Ruth. The communication made by Sir Everett to his son, and which he had over heard, caused him to alter his plans and to decide upon accompanying his host. \"I am not a great sportsman at any time, Sir"], [238, "234 Doctor Greystone. Everett,\" he said, \" but enough of a pedestrian to be always prepared for rough walking. I am quite ready to go with you.\" \"And see those wonderful otter tracks on our way. Bertie has been talking of nothing else for a week.\" The young man shrugged his shoulders im patiently, and turned away, saying ungraciously : ' ' I did not mention the otters to your friend ; I meant it for ourselves only.\" Greystone frowned, and would have replied had not the thought of the explanation he was going to seek checked an angry retort at the boy's implied insolence ; ignoring it entirely, he quietly remarked to the Baronet : \" Otter-hunting is great sport for young people who are proof against rheumatism and chills ; but, taking into consideration muddy river banks, and the damp vegetation of the water-side, a trying one to an}* but the constitution of iron of extreme youth.\" \"I do not propose to poach on Bertie's pre serves,\" said the Baronet ; \" merely to explore the place with Churton, and see if in reality there is a justification for organizing a few otter hunts, as my son is bent on instituting them. But, Greystone, you must take a gun, and bring down some wild ducks. No \u2014 no \u2014 I will hear of no denial. Churton, have you a spare fowling-piece with you ? \""], [239, "\" Who Did this Thing'\" 235 \"Yes! Sir Everett,\" answered the keeper. \" Hearing as how Mr. Greystone was back, I made sure he would be one of the party.\" \" All right. Then let us start ; we have a mile and-a-half's walk to the big pond. Go on, Chur ton, we follow you. Miss Barston will join us presently,\" continued the Baronet, carelessly taking the Doctor's arm. The action seemed a friendly one, but Grey*stone knew that the sup port was needed. Bertie had walked on ahead and alone, impatient of the companionship of the man he disliked, and prevented by his father's presence from showing him positive rudeness. The keeper had taken a short cut through a field; h'e was perfectly aware of the antagonism between his master's son and the stranger who had earned his life-long gratitude, and was never quite easy when they were together. The well-knit, active, lissom figure of the lad in his velveteen suit was silhouetted in the sun shine against the dark background of the fringe of woodland, and presented a vivid picture of buoyant youth and life. His father, as he followed in his wake, with the slower gait of age, gazed after him with undisguised pride and tenderness. He maintained a protracted silence for a time ; the first words he uttered were but the sequel to his thoughts. \" A fine fellow, is he not, Greystone? \u2014 the light"], [240, "236 Doctor Greystone. and brightness of this dull old place ; there is the making of a man worthy of his race in that boy. Do not smile, and take me for a doddering, infatuated comedy father,\" continued Sir Everett, with an unwonted sadness in his high-bred voice ; \"but I cannot bear the thought ofparting with him. Next year he must go to Oxford, in six months at the latest. We have all our heel of Achilles ; my weakness is my love for that lad. His young presence is a necessity to me. When I lose it, I lose all.\" There was a strange weariness in the Baronet's manner. The Doctor looked at him ; he was pale in the sunlight, almost wan, and the arm linked in his weighed a little more heavily. Physical exhaustion was, he thought, the reason for this unprecedented expression of the reserved gentle man's innermost feelings. \" You have your daughter, Sir Everett,\" Greystone observed gently, using almost the same words with which he had once rebuked Ruth for thinking herself of no account in her father's home. \" Oh ! certainly. I have Ruth, of course,\" the Baronet answered, with indifference. He said no more ; his eyes were still fixed on the lessening figure of the young man, who at this moment was lost among the narrowing trunks of the leafless wood. A slight shiver shook the Baronet's frame ; he sighed, and then, rousing himself as from a dream,"], [241, "\"Who Did this Thing.'\" 237 he began listlessly to talk on indifferent sub jects. Shortly affift: the two men in their turn entered the woods, and, crossing an opening, came upon a little lake or mere, divided from the river by a narrow promontory and an expanse of rushes and half-solid ground. They found Churton waiting for them. \"Mr. Barston has gone round by the rushes, Sir Everett,\" he said, touching his cap. \" He says y*ou had better stop here, as he has seen the ducks making for this corner. They are plentiful enough to-day, although a bit wild in the sunlight. Perhaps Mr. Greystone won't mind moving off to the right \u2014 about fifty yards higher up, behind them alders ; there's the gun, sir. I shall drop down there midway, between the two corners, with the dogs; leastways, if it suits you, gentlemen.\" \" All right,\" said Sir Everett languidly, slowly examining his gun. \"Good luck, Greystone, we shall compare notes at luncheon. By Jove ! \" he continued, looking at his watch, \"it is later than I thought ; we must have come very slowly. Let us shoot first and leave the otters for after luncheon. Ruth must be on her way to the Hut, if she is not there already.\" Greystone followed the direction of the Baronet's eyes, and saw the roof of a little rustic shelter, built on the promontory, and easily accessible from either side ; he almost fancied he"], [242, "Doctor Greystone. 238 could discern in the far distance a female form advancing towards it between the trees. Churton presenting him with a loaded gun. he moved towards the spot indicated by the keeper, thinking less of the wild ducks than of the girl who seemed to him to be hurrying to meet her fate. Suddenly a single shot broke the stillness ; a flight of birds passed so near him that instinc tively he raised his gun aud fired, but one instant before the report of his shot rang in his ears a low, short, stifled cry was heard, followed by an ominous silence. That cry struck his practised senses as the death wail of a human being in mortal agony, and, throwing away his weapon.be ran in the direction whence it proceeded. Two men were hurrying across the clearing between the copse and the rushes, Churton a little in advance, his head bent forward, his eyes riveted on the promontory, over which a trailing white smoke was still visible, and Sir Everett, deadly white, staggering onwards, his tall figure thrown back, his head, from which his hat had fallen, bare, and his hands outstretched as if warding off some nameless danger. All at once he stopped as if dazed or stunned, and remained motionless, gazing obscurely after Greystone and the keeper, who, without slackening their pace, were making straight for the mere. What they saw when they turned the con cealing bend of the promontory filled them with"], [243, "\"Who Did tins Thing!\" 239 horror. Half hidden by the rushes, with the glassy waters of the pond lapping his feet, was stretched the motionless body of Bertie, his face crushed into the moist earth of the bank. As Greystone turned the lad's head to the light, and slightly raised his shoulders, a few trickling drops of blood guided his hand to the throat, and to a small round blackened hole where the ball had entered and done its murderous work. The death had been almost instantaneous, silencing the half-uttered cry of mortal anguish. Churton read the truth in the Doctor's mute, helpless laying down of the head he had raised. An exclamation of angry pain escaped him. \" Who has done this?\" he muttered. Greystone started. Who ? . . . A thrill of horror and pity passed through him. Instinc- tively he looked up to see if Sir Everett was near, and although he was not in sight he mechanically placed himself so as to screen with his person the body of the dead boy. With vivid, almost audible distinctness one name sounded in the Doctor's ears. While the father was still rooted to the ground in merciful ignorance a hundred yards off, the whole peaceful, silent river bank seemed to echo with that name : Marcel, and with it the almost prophetic words, as Sir Everett had spoken them long ago : \" A father who has murdered his son kills himself.\" Was it a warning, a revelation, a mysterious command?"], [244, "240 Doctor Greystone, Before he had been able to dispel this halluci nation, a sound of light, hurrying footsteps fell on his ear, and recalled him to reality. He turned and saw Ruth. Churton in vain attempted to stop her ; his very effort attracted her attention to the lifeless form in the rushes, and, pushing the keeper aside with a wild look of terror, she fell on her knees beside it. With trembling hands she pushed aside the hair from the pallid brow, bent her ear to the half-parted mouth, sought in vain for the pulsation of the silent heart ; her lips moved and repeatedly framed the name of Bertie, but no sound escaped them. In her mute agony she seemed unconscious of any presence save that of her beloved dead ; her dilated eyes had the fixed stare of delirium. At last, shivering violently, she flung herself across the body, and, with the con viction of the ghastly truth, one long moan escaped her : \" Father ! Father ! \" Greystone stood watching her. He knew how futile would be any attempt at consolation, or else some deeper thought was maturing behind that grave, sad, resolute face of his. A profound pity, a passionate love, the holiness of an imper sonal sacrifice possessed him. That wailing cry of \" Father,\" answering to the unuttered name of Marcel, the entire abnegation of self in the woman he loved, forgetting her own pain in the deeper sorrow of another, called imperatively upon his manhood to save her from a greater horror, a"], [245, "241 \"Who Did this Thing?\" more fatal catastrophe. It seemed to him in that brief moment, during which he was experiencing a life's sensations, that what was required of him now was no longer the disculpation of his past, but the assuming of a guilt of which he was innocent. \" Ruth,\" he said She lifted her eyes, with a tremulous gesture ; she pressed her hand to her forehead ; she hardly knew where she was, whose voice was calling to her. \" Ruth,\" he repeated, in accents so low and yet so resolute that her wandering attention was arrested. \" Oh, it is you,\" she cried huskily, with tear less sobs. \"You \u2014 have you done nothing? Is there nothing to be done? \" Greystone shook his head with infinite sad\u201e ness. \"No \u2014 nothing?\" she wailed. \"He is dead \u2014 \u25a0 dead \u2014 dead ! My poor Bertie \u2014 so young, so strong ! \" Then, as a sudden thought struck her, she lifted herself from the ground, and, looking from Greystone to the keeper with a vague fear, she said hurriedly, \"How did it happen; who did it?\" The two men were silent. \"Will no one tell me?\" She stopped. Becoming whiter still, her eyes unnaturally distended, she added ; \" It is not ? \" and waited. Churton came forward. \" Don't take on so, Q"], [246, "242 Doctor Greystone. Miss. It is nobody's fault, God knows. Sir Everett \" \"My father!\" she gasped in wild terror. \" Good Heavens ! My father ! Do not say it is he, for God's sake! Not that \u2014 -not that!\" And she hid her face in her hands. \" It was not Sir Everett, Miss Barston.\" Churton started in utter bewilderment as these words came slowly, tonelessly, from Greystone's pale lips. \" Oh, thank God ! \" cried the girl, with a deep sigh of relief. But almost immediately she added: \"Who then? We must know. We shall know.\" Her accent was strangely vin dictive for one so uniformly gentle. \"I fired that fatal shot, Miss Barston A dead silence followed. Greystone was the first to break it. \"Yes, it was I,\" he repeated, not looking at her, but silencing, with an imperious gesture of command, the indignant protest he read in Churton's face and attitude. What passed in Ruth's brain at that moment she herself could not have told. The dreary strain of the preceding days, the perfidious insinuations against which she had so bravely fought, her own unacknowledged doubts, culminat ing in the shock of that fatal catastrophe, the prescience of her father's sorrow, the sting of the awful suspicion that had crossed her mind,"], [247, "\"Who Did this Thing?\" 243 maddened her with a sudden frenzy. Half insane with horror and grief, she saw before her the brother she adored murdered by the man she loved, and across the yawning gulf his own confession had opened between them she voiced and hurled at him the accusation she had repulsed, the slander she had denied. Facing Greystone, with a look of unutterable despair, she cried aloud : \" Was it not enough that you killed your wife, that you must kill our Bertie?\" And as the cruel words left her lips, her head swam, and she fell half-fainting to the ground. It was thus, in the hour of his supreme sacrifice , that James Greystone learnt with what ignominy his name was branded, and knew that the girl he loved believed him base. The keeper had taken a stride forward, as if the insult had struck him. He came close to Grey stone, and, in a -voice choked with indignation, said under his breath \u2014 \" You won't let it be said, sir. I know best.\" \" What do you know, Churton \u2014 that I am not a murderer? \" asked Greystone with a bitter smile. \" That you never fired the shot that did for him,\" he whispered, with a glance at the body. \" That you must not \" \" Can I do otherwise, Churton? Look ! \" and he pointed to the bend of the promontory, where Sir Everett was appearing, reeling like a drunken man."], [248, "244 Doctor Greystone\". \"Perhaps not,\" muttered the keeper. \"It would kill the Squire. But it's d d hard on you, sir.\" \" If you owe me any gratitude, Churton, let things be as they are. Your word that you reveal nothing,\" he added authoritatively, seeing the keeper hesitate. Churton glanced towards his master ; the sight of the stricken father decided him. \"As long as I live I will not,\" he said reluctantly. There was time for nothing more. The Baronet had come upon them. Silently, respect fully, they moved asunder to let him pass. The vision of the sight that met his eyes must have come to him when he remained transfixed on the other side of the rushes, during that interval of suspended animation which stayed his footsteps as he hurried towards the spot whence had risen Bertie's death-cry. Swaying and trembling, he gazed long and fixedly at the fair young face settling in the marble majesty of lifelessness ; slow tears swept down his cheeks, which had become suddenly sunken and haggard. The absence of all attempt to offer or demand help was a piteous proof that he had relinquished all hope. Once or twice he tried to speak, but either he dreaded to give utterance to his thoughts or else the power failed him. Of his daughter he took no notice. Partially recovering her senses, she had raised herself to a kneeling posture, and her"], [249, "\"Who Did this Thing?\" 245 tearless eyes were riveted on his face. At last, obeying a gesture of Greystone's, Churton came forward to lead his master away. The Baronet offered no resistance, but before he turned he said, almost automatically, the single word \".Who?\" It was the third time this question had been asked; for the third time it was answered. Ruth, without removing her eyes from her father's face, lifted her arm and silently pointed to James Greystone. The Baronet's eyes wandered to where he stood ; his vacant gaze barely seemed to recognise or see him, but his lips twitched, and a slight convulsion shook his frame. As he moved on, supported by the keeper, a prematurely aged and stricken man, Greystone bent his head reverently before the great despair, from which he had at such heroic cost plucked the deadly sting of unspeakable remorse ; then, becoming aware that on all sides people were flocking to the scene of the accident, he cast one long, lingering look on Ruth, that fell like a blessing on her bowed head, and, leaving her with her dead, went away \u2014 alone !"], [250, "246 Doctor Greystone.

Even Maria seemed interested. \" Well, it's just as bad as bad can be at the Hall.

I would like to, only to show I bear no ill will,\" said Mrs. Maltby, magnanimously. \" We must not carry our resent ments beyond the grave, and \" \" Oh, mother ! \" interrupted Carrie, \" they don't want our flowers or anybody else's ; it is not an ordinary bereavement \u2014 they are just dazed with grief.\" \" Still I wonder what Mrs. Turner proposes doing,\" Mrs. Maltby went on. \" Not that she can send decent flowers out of that poky greenhouse of hers, but she might have them from London. Does anyone know if she has sent up to inquire at the Hall, or if she means to call? \" \" Bother Mrs. Turner! \" from Carrie. \" After all, that poor lad was a right-minded sort of youth,\" continued Barbara, disregarding the interjection. \" He couldn't bear the sight of that wretched Greystone.

They brought it in ' accidental death.' Many a poor man would not have got off so easily, Fortunately for that fellow, it did not come out that he hated poor young Barston.\" Carrie's sense of justice revolted at this mis representation. With flashing eyes she refuted it. \"No more he did, mother. It's a burning shame to say such things. Young Barston did not like Mr. Greystone, and made no secret of it. Doctor Leslie did not like him either. You and Mrs. Turner hate him, but he, poor man, hated nobody, and Ruth loved him as much no doubt as he worshipped her.\" \" She can't love him much now that he has"], [253, "Deepening Shadows. 249 killed her brother,\" said Jessie; \"so that little affair is off anyhow.\" \" You are a nasty, spiteful thing to say so, Jessie, or even to think about it at all, at such a time.

So ta-ta,\" and blowing an ironical kiss to the unconscious visitor through the window pane, she bounced out of the room. Mrs. Maltby went to the drawing-room to receive Mrs. Turner, who, as a graceful concession to the catastrophe, was clad in sombre-hued garments, and had assumed a touching expression of sym pathetic gravity. After a little preliminary small talk, and skirmishing with the main facts, she plunged into details, and, seeing the drift of her friend's remarks, proceeded to annihilate them. \" Of course, my dear Mrs. Maltby, I shall do violence to my feelings, and go to the funeral ; it is not only a mark of respect to that young man, mowed down ruthlessly in the heyday of life, but a protestation against the misguided being who"], [254, "Doctor Greystone. 250 committed the fatal act.

She had not recovered her equanimity, and was still sore at the prospect of the part of abstention assigned to her by her crafty friend. Mrs. Turner lowered her voice, and in a faint sybillation murmured : \" Vengeance !\" Then laying a finger on her lips, looked cautiously"], [255, "Deepening Shadows. 251 round, as if in fear lest the red silk furniture of her hostess should accuse her of indiscretion. \" We never heard that there was any such suspicion, Mrs. Turner. Is there?\" said Bar bara, with frank astonishment. Eluding a direct answer, Mrs. Turner lifted her hands and eyes to the ceiling, as if in mute thanksgiving, and then resumed, in her per functory, motherly tone : \"I feel intensely relieved. I had dreaded the worst. I shall at once bid Selina harbour no such thought, and I shall make it my duty to tell everybody that such an unsupported accusation must not be permitted to gain ground. We can accept the verdict of accidental death, and not allow ourselves to be biassed by our previous knowledge of antecedents pointing to an ungovernable and vindictive nature.\" \" Have you heard if he intends leaving Syston? \" asked Mrs. Maltby, who was beginning to feel that the Coroner had erred grievously in his judg ment. \"I hope so, but doubt it. I went to Mrs. Ralph's cottage yesterday7 \" \" To see him? \" interrupted Mrs. Maltby, hor rified. \" I have not quite taken leave of my senses yet, to do such a thing. Oh, no ! I happened to remember some bits of old lace that wanted doing up. (Point looks well on black, and I shall put"], [256, "252 Doctor Greystone. on some sort of complimentary mourning for a month or so.) I preferred taking the lace myself to the laundress, so as to give her my recom mendations, and, being there, I hardly know how I happened to mention her lodger. The poor soul is infatuated with him. That sort of man casts a glamour upon the lower classes. Whether from poverty of mind, or because she makes a good thing out of the letting of her room, Mrs. Ralph is quite maudlin in her praise of Grey stone. I found out that he has not given her a week's notice as yet, nor is he making any pre parations to start.\" \" I hear he has not been seen about the place since the accident.\" \" No ; he has had that much decency. Mrs. Ralph tells me that he shuts himself up all day in his study, mostly sitting before the fire, and staring at the coals. I suggested that she must be painfully anxious to get rid of so undesirable an inmate, even if she did not believe quite all the stories about him, at which she flared up, and said with impertinent warmth : ' Bless you, Ma'am ! of course, I don't go and credit a parcel of dirty lies about my Mr. Greystone.

Still I cannot help thinking, my dear Mrs. Maltby, that that brooding over the fire savours of remorse. I am glad no one heard of it but I. I shall endeavour to explain it away as grief \u2014 regret \u2014 natural regret at an imprudent, careless act \u2014 nothing else.\" Both ladies felt that the mode of Bertie Barston's death had strangely fortified their position. It had severed their enemy from the Hall, deprived him of the powerful support and countenance of Sir Everett and his daughter, and given him up, as it were, defenceless and unarmed into their hands. As Mrs. Turner rose to go, she concluded, with ill-concealed malignity : \" I do not give him three weeks before he is hounded out of the place, and it may be that we shall yet see him on his trial. He would have done better to be on good terms with us, as he will find out to his cost.\" Meanwhile the desolate household at the Hall drifted in sombre despair through the days preceding the funeral. A hushed silence filled the old house ; still hour after hour the father kept his senile watch over his dead son, never vouchsafing a look or a word to those who at first attempted to remove him or question him on the necessary arrange ments. They ended by leaving him alone and disturbing him with no further questions. Ruth flitted in and out, apparently unheeded ; the Baronet was irresponsive to her tender care,"], [258, "254 Doctor Greystone. although he submitted to be 'tended by her ; but he was strangely impatient of her presence near the coffin and jealous of the tears she shed. In his clouded brain there seemed a vague desire to remain in absolute and undivided possession of that cold pale clay on which his eyes were inces santly fastened. When, however, they came to close the lid and he could no longer gaze on the beloved features, a sudden change came over him. The advent of strangers recalled some of his old habits ; to the astonishment of all, he straightened himself into a resemblance of his former self, and, with a return of his own stately manner, requested to be dressed and made ready to follow the hearse. \"Do not go, papa,\" implored Ruth. \"Stay here \u2014 it will be too much for you \u2014 you are not able.\" A little of his old petulance and distaste of control was perceptible in his tone as he answered : \u2014 ' ' Who says I am not able ? Who should accom pany my only son to his last resting-place, but his father ? You must come too, Ruth* It is all we can do for him, evermore ! \" His voice faltered and broke over the last words, but they saw that he was determined. Erect and bareheaded he walked behind the hearse, motionless he stood before the grave, the deep lines on his face and the dull light of his bloodshot eyes alone telling"], [259, "Deepening Shadows. 255 of the agony endured. Mechanically he listened to the speeches of condolence addressed to him by the mourners as they gathered round him at the close of the ceremony, and allowed them to press his passive hand, but he answered never a word, nor let his glance rest on them. He remained impassible, stern, immovable to the end. Ruth, in her deep mourning, clung to his side, anxious and awed by that unearthly calm, fearing some new calamity. Only once her eyes strayed from his face. When the first shovelful of earth fell on the lowered coffin she turned startled towards the grave, and, as her glance wandered mechanically beyond it, she became aware of the presence of a man standing with crossed arms at some distance off, leaning against a sycamore. She knew him, with a strange thrill. It was James Greystone. Why did he not come nearer and mingle his regret with theirs ? Why ? There came to her even then, with a wild, bitter remorse, the memory of the cruel words she had spoken in the insanity of her first horror of her brother's death, and her whole soul rose in indig nant denial at her own injustice. At that moment Greystone slowly lifted his hat and, moving away, left the churchyard before the last rites were fully ended. Was it a farewell ? It seemed so to Ruth, and the thought smote her with an added pain in the"], [260, "Doctor Greystone. 256 midst of her sorrow, as if she herself had raised insuperable barriers against the only consolation she could ever know. Doctor Leslie gently touched her arm. \" We must take Sir Everett away. I have had the carriage brought to the gate of the cemetery. I fear he will not stand much more of this. Help me to bring him home.\" Warned by the Doctor, the mourners dispersed quietly, and the Baronet suffered himself to be led away by his daughter. With the conclusion of the ceremony he seemed to relapse into the supine apathy of the earlier days. Henceforth he lived the life of a recluse \u2014 never left the grounds and rarely the house itself, wandering aimlessly through the rooms and corridors, spending long hours in what had been Bertie's apartment, surrounded by the boy's dogs, touching with trembling, loving fingers his guns, whips, or fishing rods. Sometimes in the library he would automatically take down a volume and bring it to his desk, but he did not open or read its pages ; spoke but little and had neither caress nor kind words for Ruth, whose unremitting attentions he accepted silently. The old irritation was gone, the self-assertion, the dignified sarcasm; alone some of the former grave courtliness remained in the wreck of all other faculties. In a nameless fashion, his daughter became conscious that she was necessary to him, and that, while"], [261, "Deepening Shadows. 257 never appearing to be aware of her presence, he missed her when she was long absent. He denied himself to all visitors and refused to see Doctor Leslie. On one occasion, a week or two after the funeral, he appeared in great bodily pain. Ruth, after trying to relieve him by all the usual means \u2014 frightened at his excessive exhaus tion \u2014 involuntarily said half aloud: \"If only Mr. Greystone was here ! \" As the Baronet had never referred to the cause of Bertie's death, she had tried to believe that he had forgotten, if he had ever known, at whose hand the lad had met his fate. To her terror and surprise, at the mention of the name, Sir Everett was galvanized into life. An expression of intense hatred con vulsed his pale face and a fierce gleam lit up his vacant eyes. He raised his hand as if for a curse, and said hoarsely : \u2014 \" If the man still lives who has killed my son, let him never come near me or mine or, by God, I shall avenge on him Bertie's death ! \" He fell back in his chair, half-fainting. When he recovered consciousness he seemed to have lost the memory of what had passed ; but, by the poignant pain that Ruth had felt, she knew that her love for Greystone was as strong as it had suddenly become hopeless. a"], [262, "Doctor Greystone. 258 CHAPTER II. RUTH SEES LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS. An immense discouragement had fallen on James Greystone during the long, solitary musings of which Mrs. Ralph had spoken. He bitterly reviewed his life, and gazed mourn fully, into the future. He knew now how' the past had pursued him, how his own weakness had fostered the evil reports he had thought buried for ever. He no longer thought of re-vindicating his place in the world. Obscurity to him was peace. For Ruth only had his ambition risen anew ; for her only did he want fame, applause, success, and wealth. Ruth gone from him, his ambition was dead. Society had no allurements, celebrity no glamour. Elevated and purified by his love, his isolation and retirement would be less selfish and self-complacent than of yore. He had learnt the nobleness of devotion and sacrifice, but the opportunities of benefiting his fellow-men were none the less at hand for being restricted to a smaller sphere ; whether he exercised his profession in a large city, and reaped honours, or in an obscure village, and received no returns, there would still be pain to soothe, suffering to assuage, wounds to heal. But whence would relies come to him ? Soli tary, indeed, would be his life ; no ray of sunshine"], [263, "Ruth sees Light in the Darkness. 259 would come across his path to render it less dark to his weary feet. Ruth had doubted him ; Ruth had given credence to a foul lie against his honour ; unheard she had condemned him, be come at once his accuser and his judge. The rock of her faith, on which he had built all his hopes of future happiness, had crumbled away at the first breath of calumny, and she had arrayed herself against him. When he was giving her the supreme proof of his love, saving her father from suicide, assuming the onus of an accident in order to avert further calamities ; when, in the absolute forgetfulness of self, he had endangered even the possibility of winning her, she had thrown at him an outrage which proved how entirely she had cast him off. In the very moment when he imperilled his chances of vindicating himself to her against vague reports, she had told him that she credited him with a crime ! That was the reward of his devotion, the consummation of his love ! His first impulse had been to leave Syston at once, and go forth again a wanderer . But his pride rebelled against the cowardice of flight. True, his openly-confessed share in the accident that had deprived the Baronet of his only son would give him a plausible pretext for removing himself from a neighbourhood where his presence might be painful to the bereaved household ; but the libels of which he had, at the same time,"], [264, "260 Doctor Greystone. become aware commanded him more imperatively to remain. Let but one mem hint ever so slightly at a derogatory rumour, and he would compel him to unsay his words and to apologise. Further explanations he could not give. Once more he Was confronted with the same perplexing dilemma. To clear himself victoriously, he must expose Grace Bertall's shame, brand her memory, rescind the pardon he extended over her corpse, and give up her name to the world as the fallen wife of an outraged husband. No ; the silence observed in Paris closed his lips in England. He had assumed the duties and responsibilities of clemency, and lost the right of shifting the burden because it suddenly weighed heavier on his shoulders. The dead woman's secret was sealed on his lips; the dishonour he had condoned had an imprescriptible claim on his honour. But James Greystone would not again turn his back on suspicion and slander. He would neither appeal nor sue for justice ; he would neither brave nor refute opinion ; he would simply stay and live down evil repute by the mere authority of his unimpeachable life ; he would meet with passive scorn the decree that ostracised him from the com monwealth of honest men. He set his teeth hard as he murmured : \" They have condemned me \u2014 so be it ! It will be for them to take back this condemnation. I shall live among them till they own themselves liars, and me blameless \u2014 till"], [265, "Ruth sees Light in the Darkness. 261 Ruth herself, who has believed in them, will have absolved me.\" The persistence of Mr. Greytstone in ignoring with contemptuous indifference the covert anL mosity of his neighbours was his best weapon against them- In vain did they quote his. obstinacy in remaining at Syston as another proof of his callousness and profligacy; in vain were the suspicious circumstances of young Barston's death alluded to with covert malignity ; in vain did Mrs. Maltby storm and Mrs. Turner im sinuate ; their most venomous shafts glanced from the armour of his impassiveness. More over, strong as the general feeling in Syston was against the stranger, few men had been found willing to give it the support of active partisanship, \" You can please yourself about receiving or not receiving Greystone,\" said Maltby tb his wife. \"I agree with you, that, all things con sidered, it is wiser to drop him ; but don't go and mix me up in any unpleasantness.\" \" That's you all over, Fred. You'd sit down and let the house fall about your ears without as much as listing a hand to stop it,\" said Barbara, angrily and irrelevantly. \" Mrs. Turner says that if her husband was alive she would make him cut the fellow dead, and tell him the reason why.\" \"How thankful Turner must be to lie in his grave,\" drily remarked Mr. Maltby. \" But, as I"], [266, "Doctor Greystone. 262 am not Mrs. Turner's husband, I shall do nothing of the kind.\" The worthy man was not quite satisfied with the part he had enacted at the onset, and the majority of Syston fathers and husbands inclined to a policy of abstention. They tacitly agreed to affranchise themselves from their better halves, and contented themselves with avoiding Greystone with more or less successful ease, eschewing any aggressive demonstration, and remaining con veniently blind to the guerilla warfare of their womankind. Gradually the dull monotony of inaction wdrich follows a storm settled over Syston ; the winter and spring glided by bringing no change. The lonely dweller in Mrs. Ralph's cottage had resumed the life he led when he first became her lodger ; the hovels and poor tenements knew him well, and Jn his long solitary walks and rambles he passed like a Vincent de Paule, opening his hand and purse to the beggar and the vagrant. The Hall was still sombre and closed. Ruth, like Antigone, ministered to her father, paler and sadder than of yore, as gentle and as uncomplaining. . The light born of a new felicity had died out of her meek eyes ; her steps had lost the elasticity of youth which they had acquired. Her grave lips had forgotten their smile, and no rosy flush suffused the whiteness of her cheeks. She knew that Greystone had not left the cottage, and with"], [267, "Ruth sees Light in the Darkness. 263 a faint wonder asked herself what kept him there. He had made no effort to communicate with her ; as the days passed and she on rare occasions ventured abroad, she sometimes met him, but never by look or sign did he appear conscious of her presence ; she noted with a keen anguish that, if he could do so unaffectedly, he would avoid her, retracing his footsteps or turning into another lane. When they were forced to pass each other his eyes did not meet hers ; she thought him each time older-looking, more stern, more hag gard. Time hung heavy on her hands with a weariness she had not experienced in the old days when her life was colourless. She looked back to that by gone time with a vague regret ; like most of us, she remembered her joys with sadness, and her sadness with envy. She had been ignorant then \u2014 now she measured the intensity of her short-lived bliss by7 the pain of its loss. She had been too happy, and life seemed inexpressibly unending. As the months rolled on, as summer returned with the memories of the past year, she would think of her lover iu his immense isolation, and reproach herself with his wasted life. The remembrance of her last fatal words to him became intolerable, and she yearned for one word that would tell her that he had forgiven or forgotten them. Her happiest moments were when, ever and anon, in"], [268, "264 Doctor Greystone, some cottage or by street she would hear his praises from the poor he had assisted, the sick he had tended. The humble and the destitute, so blind to their own interests, had with the unerring instincts of the populace, reversed the judgment of their betters, Not one among them but would laugh to scorn the idea that \"Our Mister Grey stone could have done a wrong thing in his life. If there were more the likes of him 'twould be better for all,\" they said. Churton's gratitude had become a passionate reverence, and he resented with unrestrained violence any7 aspersion on his benefactor's character , With mingled feelings of sweetness and pain, Ruth listened and silently echoed every word of love or homage spoken of the man she loved. Mrs. Turner had been unremitting in her endeavours to keep up a speaking and visiting acquaintance with the Barstons. Ruth instinc tively mistrusting her, and with feminine divination guessing that she had indirectly been the origi nator of the crusade against Greystone, had met her advances with such frigidity that any other woman would have been discouraged. But Mrs. Turner persevered unrebuffed, till one day she contrived to effect an entry at the Hall under pretext of consulting Miss Baiston anent the annual school feast. After hastily dismissing the question of cakes, buns, and piugs, she glanced sympathetically at"], [269, "Ruth sees Light in the Darkness. 265 Ruth's black garments, and, seizing both her hands in hers, exclaimed: \" My dear, dear Miss Barston, I was not pre pared to find you so altered, so stricken down with grief. For the last five months I have longed to come to you, to comfort you, to be a mother to you in your affliction.\" She stopped, buL receiv ing no response, continued, \" Do not before me put this unnatural strain on your feelings. Weep, weep on my bosom ! and when I have dried your tears, let me urge on you Christian fortitude, Christian resignation, Christian forgiveness.\" Ruth looked up at the last word. Although shocked at her visitor's manner, she answered quietly and coldly : \" Certain griefs are too sacred for words ; mine is one of those. You were'saying that the school children \" \" Oh, nevermind them now, dear Miss Barston. I can think but of you and Sir Everett. You are looking very delicate ; let me suggest change of air.\" \" I cannot leave my father, Mrs. Turner,\" an swered Ruth, with gentle decision. \" We would look after Sir Everett, and make him our charge.

Go ! and when you repeat my words, add that they came from Bertie's sister.\" Without another look she left the room, pre serving her proud dignity to the last. When she was alone she burst into a storm of tears and sobs. The following day a little black-edged note was placed in Greystone's hands by Churton. He had been told to deliver it in person. It ran thus : \u2014 \u25a0 \" For the words that escaped me by my brother's dead body forgive me. I shall never forgive myself for uttering them. I know them to be as untrue and as false as any spoken against your truth, your loyalty, and your honour. \" Rt'TH Barston.\" A great thrill of pride and joy passed through his veins as he read. \"At last \u2014 at last, my darling!\" he mur mured. Then, as the thought arose that she would never have written to him had she not felt that they were parted for evermore, his ej'es darkened and his head fell forward on his outstretched arms."], [272, "268 Doctor Greystone. CHAPTER III. carrie's budget of news. Towards the end of that same summer Carrie Maltby had what her mother styled \"one of her cranky turns,\" and became unmanageable. The girl, in spite of her volatile manner, had suffered more than she cared to confess from her com pulsory estrangement from Ruth. She would at any time have broken through the tyrannical rules laid down by her mother and testified her friendship either openly or clandestinely had Miss Barston given her the slightest provocation to do so. But Ruth had persevered in her gentle but unwavering determination not to encourage her friend in disobedience. Carrie fretted and chafed under what she considered an unjustifi able oppression, and, removed from the con trolling influence of a more refined nature, relapsed into her reckless and independent ways of manner and speech. She was restless and irritable, either wildly excited or unusually sullen. At one time she threatened to walk down the High Street with Mr. Greystone ; at another to call on him at the Cottage and tell him to come and fight his battles like a man, assuring him that she personally thought him a brick, even if others thought him a murderer ; and her mother felt that she was quite capable in her present"], [273, "Carrie's Budget of News. 269 mood, to carry out her threats. She invented new sobriquets and surnames for Mrs. Turner every day, mimicked her behind her back and almost to her face, voted her a viper and Selina a sneak, and altogether comported herself in so outrageous a fashion that Mrs. Maltby was at her wit's end, hovering between persuasion, flattery, and objurgation, and making matters fifty times worse. She had had to endure wordy homilies from Mrs. Turner, who professed herself much concerned, and to submit to advice and com placent self-glorification at the lady's own superior management of girls. Mrs. Maltby bridled up in defence of her own flock, and a serious breach between the mothers was only averted by a judicious move of Mrs. Turner, who could ill afford to quarrel just yet with her quondam ally7. She proposed to take charge of Carrie for a few months, and carry her off with her own daughter to Dunkerque, where she intended to spend the winter for educational purposes. \" The child must improve her French and music, and she would be all the better for a com panion nearer her own age. It would be an inestimable advantage for Carrie to come with us. Her French is just a leetle shaky. You can trust her to me, dear Mrs. Maltby. I shall look after her like my own child ; they will neither of them ever leave my sight for a moment, I assure you."], [274, "Doctor Greystone. 270 Depend upon it, my system of constant super vision is the best. It has answered admirably with Selina, who at eighteen is guileless as a child, docile as a lamb, and believes there is nobody like her mother.\" The proposal would have been formally nega tived, had not Mrs. Maltby been fain to acknow ledge to herself that she was unable to coerce Carrie, and that a plan which would quietly remove her for a while, and change the current of her thoughts, was, on the whole, not to he despised. Carrie herself, although her com panions were eminently distasteful to her, was carried away by the proposal of foreign travel, albeit only as far as Dunkerque, with a faint perspective of possible Paris later on ; and was only too glad to turn her back on Syston, which she hated. She, therefore, acquiesced in the plan with just as much ungraciousness as she could venture to display. In due time, St. John's Lodge was put in curl papers, delivered over to the caretaker, and the three ladies started for the Continent. In January, the following letter came from Carrie, addressed to her favourite sister Jessie : \"Dunkerque, Pension Bory. My Dear Jess, \u2014 \"You'll never guess what's up. It's just the biggest lark, and so spicy. I never enjoyed"], [275, "Carrie's Budget of News. 271 anything so much in my whole life. It's al about Selina. ' Old Central News ' is as good as a play\u2014 though, to do the old girl justice, she has the pluck of a prizefighter and the brass of a German band, and don't know when she's beat. It serves her uncommonly right after all, for coming down so sharp on other girls, and keeping that precious ' child ' of hers in a glass case all her life. Miss T. has kicked over the traces in fine style, and bamboozled us all round. Sugar wouldn't melt in her mouth, you know; and it was always 'Yes, mother darling!' and 'No, mother darling!' and 'Oh, Carrie, how can you ? ' How could she is more to the point. \"Well, she took French lessons and music lessons, ' Central News ' being always present ; because it wasn't proper for a snuffy old professor to be alone with a young girl ; but, after dinner, mamma used to have a nap in our private sitting room, and to send the ' child' to lie down flat for an hour in her bedroom on the floor for the sake of her figure, and read an improving book for the sake of her intellect,' bidding her be sure and lock her door. Selina grumbled a little to me at first, but soon she seemed to like it, and no doubt she did \u2014 for it came out afterwards that she used to fasten her door on the outside, and slip down to the common parlour of the Pension (where she was prohibited from ever setting her foot), to meet a good-looking, young French doctor, practising in"], [276, "272 Doctor Greystone. the town, and taking his meals at Madame Bory's. She must have got on with him like a house on fire ; anyhow, last Saturday she never came down to tea as usual at nine. After a bit, Mrs. Turner sent me upstairs to call her. I knocked, and knocked, and knocked. No one answered. I reported to Mrs. Turner, who nearly went into hysterics, cursed the foreign town, and, screaming that her dear child lay dead behind the door, had it burst open. AVe found the room empty, and a neat little note pinned to the pincushion in the orthodox heroine fashion. Selina coolly in formed Darling Mother that her virgin heart had spoken ; that she obeyed its mandate ; and had gone to the arms of her own Laurent. Before another day dawned she would be able to sign herself as ' always her dutiful daughter, Selina Noel.\" Tableau! For once old Mother T. had not a word to say ; but it didn't last long. She gasped, rallied, and came up to the scratch in double-quick time. ' Thank God,' she ex claimed for the benefit of the Pension people ; 'mij daughter is safe. Only, dear child, she is so romantic ; and her foolish little head ran away with her discretion. Noel \u2014 let me see \u2014 Noel ? An excellent young man, in the medical profession \u2014 the Noels are an old Languedocian family. My dear Carrie, I am a little surprised, but \u2014 delighted.'

That same night she found where her love birds had flown to (quotation !) ; discovered the chapel off the Grande Rue where they were to be spliced ; got there just as the ceremony was over, blessed them, and sent them off, much to their amaze ment, on their honeymoon, with the understand ing that they were to be at Syston in three weeks, to be introduced to the County as man and wife. Now what do you think of that \u2014 for cheek ? Love to all \" Carrie 'P.S. \u2014 We are coming home at once.\" The official intimation of the marriage preceded them. With consummate dexterity, Mrs. Turner availed herself of the French fashion, and sent out the foreign faire 'parts , saving herself thereby a host of explanations, and giving an exotic gloss to the abrupt proceedings : \"Madame Turner, de St. John's Lodge, Syston, Leicestershire, Grande Bretagne, a Vhonneur de vous faire part du mariage de sa fille unique Selina avec Monsieur le Docteur Noel Laurent de Dunkerque, France ; \" and the duplicate form \u2014 \" Monsieur le Docteur Noel Laurent ii Vhonneur de vous faire part de son mariage avec Mademoi- s"], [278, "274 Doctor Greystone. selle Selina Turner, de St. John's Lodge, Syston, Gdc.

If some of her friends remained incredulous, if the word elope ment was whispered, none were bold enough to contradict her statements, and preparations were made to receive the young couple with open arms. They appeared in due time in all the splendour of a bridal outfit provided by Mrs. Turner after the ceremony, on a scale of splendour becoming an only daughter contracting a perfectly desirable alliance. The bridegroom won golden opinions for his admirable behaviour, and comported himself with tact and discretion. He was at heart intensely bored by his mother-in-law, and longed to carry off his bride beyond her reach, but, having sense enough to see the advantage of her countenance under the circumstances, he submitted with a good grace to be lionised, petted, and made much of. He was honestly in love with Selina ; her conviction that her mother would leave Dun kerque at once if she gained a suspicion of her daughter's love affair had alone led him to propose"], [279, "Carrie's Budget of Neics. 275 and carry out the stolen match, and he was inex pressibly reheved when matters arranged them selves after a less romantic fashion. Moreover, though he had taken his wife portionless, in the belief that Mrs. Turner would prove inexorable, he was not sorry to receive with her a dowry that would enable him, coupled with his own means, to eventually take a practice in Paris, and enter upon his married life with fair prospects. The stay of the happy pair was limited to a fortnight, as the young Doctor's duties necessi tated his return to France. On the last Sunday, he took Selina off for a tete-a-tete walk in the lanes. Mrs. Turner had attempted to assert her old dictatorial interference, and talked propheti cally of damp feet and possible snow, but the yomig husband had prevailed over the mother, and the married lovers started gleefully, hke children on a stolen holiday. At a safe distance from the town, in an un frequented path, they stopped by a stile, and fell into the long, tender talk of a hardly waning honeymoon, not unmixed with such endearments as the loneliness of the surroundings warranted.

Darling mother is not quite sure that he did not fire on our Squire's son on purpose.\" Laurent Noel had listened with wide-open eyes in mute astonishment. When his wife stopped, he recovered his speech, and in a burst of fervid indignation he exclaimed : \"But this is an abominable tissue of lies!

Two hours later he knocked at Mrs. Ralph's cottage. \"Let me see Monsieur Greystone,\" he said to her when she answered his call. He was admitted. Once more the two men stood face to face as they had done in the room of the Rue du Cherche Midi with Grace Bertall's dead body stretched between them ; the offended and the offender ; the accused and the accuser. Greystone rose. He was very pale. He had recognised Laurent Noel. \"Monsieur,\" began the latter, without giving him time to speak, \" Monsieur, listen to me.\" His voice was husky with a strong emotion, but there was an air of manliness and loyalty about him which commanded attention \u2014 even respect. \" Long ago,\" he continued, \" a great misfortune happened.

He felt no anger against the young man, only a sort of vague wonder that his rehabilitation should come thus through him who had been the primary cause of his being suspected. Was he once more to throw away the opportunity of clearing his honour, the possibility of escape from his self-imposed ban, or must he eternally be dragged down by the shameful secret he had so religiously kept? Laurent watched him with burning eyes. Perhaps he guessed the conflict that was going on behind that stern exterior, for he spoke again \u2014 \" Let me explain,\" he said. Greystone at these words broke his silence. \" Laurent Noel, the past is buried ; buried be yond recall ; neither you nor I have a right now to exhume it \u2014 I to clear myself, you to defend me.

Fare- Well.\" Laurent Noel knew the interview was ended, and that he was looking his last on the man he had wronged, and who, by a strange, cruel con tradiction, he had never ceased to love and respect. He looked intently at Greystone. He would have given all he possessed for a word of pardon from those stern, sad lips. Perhaps Greystone read the pathetic pleading of the earnest eyes, for almost involuntarily he repeated : \" I have said it ; the past is buried ! \" Laurent took a quick step forward as if to seize the Doctor's hand, but, recollecting himself, he drew back and, bending low before him, withdrew."], [285, "Churton keeps his Promise. 281 CHAPTER IV. CHURTON KEEPS HIS PROMISE. Mrs. Turner's masterly management of her daughter's escapade, so pre-eminently successful in its effects, had had one result which even her astute diplomacy could not have foreseen. By representing her son-in-law as a man of family, of importance, of assured position, of unimpeachable respectability, she had invested him in the eyes of her little world with an authority which they might otherwise have been tempted to refuse to a new-comer. Before the departure of the young couple for France, the whole country-side knew how erroneous had been their judgment on Mr. Greystone. Laurent Noel, with the delicate tact of his nation, abstained from all circumstantial evidence, and baffled the curiosity of his hearers when questioned respecting absolute facts ; but he contrived to let all Syston know how high had been the repute of Dr. Greystone, how utterly unimpeachable his character and blameless his life ; he spoke of the eminence he had attained in his profession, of the pride with which men of science in France and Germany hailed him as colleague and friend ; of his discoveries, his exceptional merit and modesty, his passionate love for his mother, his sorrow at her loss ; and, as his word was not for one moment doubted, the cm-rent of public opinion turned abruptly, and the"], [286, "282 Doctor Greystone. verdict of the last year was absolutely reversed. Syston was profuse in apologies, excuses, and professions of renewed friendship. The Syston Chronicle in its weekly issue printed a leader bristling with metaphors and similes in which it regretted that a pall of doubt had momentarily eclipsed the pure flame of a shining meteor, and embittered with the venom of malevolence the Arcadian retirement which one of the greatest luminaries of the medical profession had courted in their midst. Ruth heard and rejoiced. It seemed to her that her lot would be less dreary now that James Greystone had come triumphantly out of his ordeal. She rejoiced with that sublime abnega- tion of women who are content to suffer if the object of their affections is spared one pang, who can crush their own agony and smile on the happiness they cannot share. She rejoiced, and yet she felt that the hour of the final separation had sounded. She had divined that his pride alone had kept him at Syston ; now that the brand was removed he would depart and never more would she see his face, never more breathe the air which he breathed, and ere long not even hear his name from careless lips. That slight bond which passing encounters kept up between them would be severed. And yet she could not by word or sign bid him stay ; nor could she tell him that she wished him god-speed. Her father's"], [287, "Churton keeps his Promise. 283 denunciation, her brother's grave, stood between them. The stricken, half-dazed Baronet kept alive in the wreck of his mind his insane hatred of the man who had caused his son's death. That single feeling subsisted as of yore, when, in the full possession of his faculties, his heart had beaten with only one earthly love : Bertie. This, then, was the end of her short dream of bliss \u2014 the end even of her uncertainties and her fears. She accepted it, as she would have accepted death \u2014 passively, mutely \u2014 unresistingly. The future was a great blank ; no effort of her mind would henceforth be able to conjure up a vision of Greystone in his new existence ; he would drop out of her life \u2014 out of the life she must live out alone, with nought but the memory of one short year of happiness, and the misery that followed. Ruth had guessed rightly. James Greystone was preparing to leave Syston in order to with draw himself at once from the fulsome syco phancy of which he was once again the object, more distasteful a thousand times than the pre vious enmity. A few days longer and he would be gone, weary with the struggle, undated by victory, and carrying away but one crumb of com fort in the huge desolation that encompassed him. The note written by Ruth, the tangible proof that she had not waited for a public vindi cation of his honour to assert her trust and belief in him, had kept up his courage through many"], [288, "284 Doctor Greystone. lonely hours ; it would ever be to him a convincing testimony, the proof that when he centred on her the whole strong, entire passion of his manhood he had chosen rightly. It was at no unworthy shrine that he had offered up his sacrifice ; and, whatever of pain to both his Quixotic impulse had brought, he had that profound faith in Ruth's nobleness of nature that she herself, knowing what the consequences were, would have bidden him act as he had done. But a fatality on which he had not counted stayed his steps at the eleventh hour. The fever which had been kept at bay all the preceding year, circumscribed in the narrow area of the paper mills and low-lying districts, burst out almost instantaneously with all-pervading viru lence. In less than three days every part of the town and country-side was infected. The passing bell sounded incessantly ; the staff of nurses and medical men was lamentably inade quate to meet the emergency ; the resources of the hospital were tested to the utmost ; the ser vices of Dr. Greystone became invaluable, nay, indispensable ; and he gave them without hesita tion, without stint. From early dawn till late in the night he went from one sick bed to another, multiplying his visits, keeping for himself the poorest quarters, and working as much good by his moral support as by his professional skill. The epidemic raged for six weeks, and when it"], [289, "Churton keeps his Promise. 285 w7as gorged with victims it lapsed as abruptly as it had commenced. The Maltbys, Mrs. Turner, and others had fled with the abject fear that hides its cowardice under the name of responsibility for others, carry ing away their children and servants ; the Hall, in the immunity of its great sorrow, had been spared, although Ruth, unchecked by paternal solicitude, had moved like a Sister of Mercy amidst the sick and the dying, not avoiding, not seeking Greystone, and yet never meeting him. Churton, who had braved the danger when it was at its height in order to watch over the doctor, bringing him wine and food in the infected tene ments and forcing him to snatch an hour of rest, like the soldier killed by a spent ball when the battle is over, was the last to take the fever. From the first there was no hope. On the third day he wandered a little ; towards evening he seemed to rally, however, and earnestly asked for pen and paper. His wife gave him what he wanted, instinctively feeling that opposi tion would be more harmful than compliance. He wrote slowly and laboriously for a few minutes ; then securing the letter in an envelope, he handed it to Mrs. Churton. \" Take it to Miss Barston, Jane, the first thing to-morrow morning, without fail,\" he said faintly, in short, panting sentences."], [290, "286 Doctor Greystone. Almost immediately he fell into a dose, and when the day broke he was dead. Jane Churton obeyed her husband's last bequest with the unquestioning fidelity of her class, and before noon Ruth received the keeper's letter. - \" Miss Ruth,\" it ran, \" I swore that as long as I lived I'd keep the secret. I'm dying now7, and it weighs too heavy to let me go in peace. It was not Mr. Greystone as fired the shot that did for Master Bertie. I'll swear to that. I heard the scream a matter of five seconds before his gun went off. The Squire need never know ! \" Your obedient servant, \"Churton, Head Keeper.\" That same evening, James Greystone was alone in his little parlour. Mrs. Ralph had retired early, and no sound broke the dreary solitude. The room looked barer, more dismal than usual. All the books were packed in two nailed cases; a couple of portmanteaus lay locked in a corner ; the papers were gone from the desk ; some of them were still smouldering on the hearth, where the Doctor had burnt them. He was going by the early train on the following day. Whither, he had not decided, although London must be the first stage of his journey. He was going forth no longer in quest of distraction or forgetfulness, but to seek work, hard, engrossing work, at home or abroad. Work in fever-stricken hospitals, in the ambulance of distant armies, in the crowded"], [291, "Churton keeps his Promise. 287 lazarettos of quarantined ports, no matter where, so that it was work \u2014 work that would still the dull pain, fill the aching void of his heart. The lamp was burning low, the embers were choked by the ashes of the charred papers ; the wind was moaning outside as it had moaned in the woodlands on the November afternoon when Ruth had come towards him at the stile ; it almost seemed to him as if he could hear the sound of hurrying steps. They stopped ; he listened. A slight knocking at the door startled him ; he went to open it, and Ruth stood before him. Silently and swiftly she entered, closing the door behind her. She was wrapped from head to foot in a long black cloak, its hood drawn over her head. He thought her strangely pale ; but as he gazed at her with the hungry, yearning passion of his eyes, a faint colour rose, deepened on her cheek, and mounted to her forehead. She laid her hand on his arm. \" James ! \" \u2014 the words came low and very distinctly. \"James, I love you ! ' ' With a half-suppressed cry of triumph he opened his arms. She drew back a little, and went on: \"I have loved you all these days, and shall love you all my life. It is to tell you this that I have come.\" \" Oh, my darling ! God bless you ! \" After a"], [292, "Doctor Greystone. 288 pause he added, with a faint hesitation : \"Your father?\" \" Hush ! \" she interrupted, and a dark shadow of pain passed in her troubled eyes : \" My father knows nothing, but I know.\" Then, seeing his bewilderment, she drew forth the keeper's note and gave it to him. He read it in silence, twice over. When he looked up again there was an expression of relief mingled with one of anxiety, in his face. He was not wholly reassured. A presentiment of something he could not fathom stole over him. She began again with the same gentle, forced serenity : \u2022 \" There is nothing between you and me now, dear ; not a shadow, not a fear, not a memory. We have the right to love each other always. I wanted you to know it. God bless you, James ! Good-bye ! \" \" Good-bye ! No, no ! \" he cried, taking hold of both her extended hands, and drawing her closer to him. \" Not good-bye, my own ! Ah, may you never know, child, what it cost me to keep that secret, when I realized how thoroughly it severed me from you.\" \" Yes, it was very hard. It will not be so hard, will it, dear, now that we share it together? Kiss me, James, and \u2014 farewell ! \" She turned and moved towards the door. \" Fcr heaven's sake, what does this mean >"], [293, "Churton keeps his Promise. 289 Ruth ? Surely I can claim you now, my love, my wife ! \" She shook her head sadly, and laid her finger on the last line of Churton's letter. \" The Squire need never know,\" she repeated mechanically. Greystone fell back. What baseless mirage had deluded his senses ? What madness had possessed him? \" The Squire need never know!\" His self-assumed duty was the same. He had not preserved the father's reason and life at such a sacrifice, only to cast on him with double cruelty the horror of his participation in his son's death ! No ; the girl, whose heart was breaking, had no thought that it w*ould be otherwise. Nothing was changed. Could they go hand-in hand before Sir Everett, and tell him : \" We may marry, for it is you who have killed your son \" ? Ruth was still standing before him, motionless with the infinite pity of her love and the un wavering acceptation of her fate. All her soul seemed to have taken refuge in her eyes as she looked at him with the long, despairing gaze that strives to take the impress of a loved face, to treasure it for ever in the memory of the heart. \"Good-bye!\" he said suddenly. He strained her to his breast for one brief moment, then loosed his embrace and let her go. Without another word, he opened the door. She passed T"], [294, "290 Doctor Greystone. out, and he watched her till she was lost in the darkness. * * * * \" My dear Mrs. Maltby,\" said Mrs. Turner to her friend, eighteen months later, \"what do you think of the new people at the Hall ?

I don't approve of hurried matches. -I want to know something of my future son-in-law, and none of my daughters would look at a foreigner.\" \"Where is Ruth Barston at present?\" said Mrs. Turner, irrelevantly. Laurence Nod had on the whole been disappointing, and his in dependence mortified her ; only she would not let her friend see it. \" In London,\" answered Carrie. \" Aren't you sorry now you ever quarrelled with her? \" \" Not quarrelled, dear Carrie ! Only when people are under a cloud it is best not to visit them.\" \" Well, both Ruth and Doctor Greystone have come out of their cloud with flying colours, at any rate.\" \" There are credulous or charitable people willing to see it in that light,\" said Mrs. Turner, half contemptuously and half sceptically. \" And Ruth, dear, good creature that she is, never bore malice. As soon as mother allowed me to go to her, she received me kindly. She's as sweet as ever.\" \" Do you happen to know if she meets Dr. Greystone in London ? \" continued Mrs. Turner, with some asperity.

After a pause, she resumed reflectively : \" Ruth's mourning will be quite over by then, you know, and I should not wonder if she went with him after all.\" \" Carrie ! think of what you are saying, I beg of you,\" said Mrs. Turner, throwing up her hands in virtuous deprecation. \" I have let the cat out of the bag, after all,\" said the young girl, laughing and blushing. \" Well, Mrs. Turner, it's all settled ; they are going to be married ; so what's the use of dawd ling over it ? \" \" Indeed !

In purpose and treatment it is set above and apart from the meritorious novels of the day by the convincing sincerity of the one and the admirable moderation of the other. Its theme, the ruin of a man's life by the combined action of his own weakness and a woman's vanity, is as old as human history ; the handling of it is up to date ; all the complex movement of our feverish, unscrupulous time is used with an easy exercise of knowledge rarely to be found in the writing of a woman. This masterly workmanship is particularly striking in the scenes of journalistic and political life. A saying of Paul Bourget, 'Qui dit vanite, dit toujours cruaute,\" is Lady Colin Campbell's text; none can fail to recognise the skill, the courage, and the absorbing interest of her discourse. There is no mock heroism about the man, Darell Blake ; no tawdry gorgeousness about the woman, Lady Alma Vercker; and the drawing of the wife's character (there are but three figures in this life study), the telling of her story, form a crowning triumph of bold brave realism.
