Gold. \u2014 Native Gold. \u2014 Distinguished from all minerals it resembles by its flattening under a hammer ; its cutting like lead, although considerably harder ; its resisting the action of nitric acid, hot or cold ; and its high specific gravity. Platinum, Iridium, Palladium. \u2014 Native Platinum, the source of the platinum of commerce, is distinguished by the same tests as gold, and it is mainly on account of its malleability that it occurs in flattened grains, or scales. Platiniridium is another ore, somewhat harder. Iridosmine resembles platinum, but it scratches glass, and gives the reaction of osmium, besides being rather brittle. Silver. \u2014 The important silver ores are : Native Silver, sectile and malleable like gold ; the only one that has a white color. Silver Glance, or Sulphide of Silver, blackish lead gray, cutting (unlike the following) nearly like pure lead ; cubic in crystallization. Ptrargyrite and Proustite, or Ruby Silver Ore, ruby red to black, always giving a bright red powder. Freislebenite, or Gray Silver Ore, steel-gray, rather brittle, and powder steel-gray. Stephanite, or Brittle or Black Silver Ore, iron-black, and giving an iron-black powder. Kerargyrite, or Horn Silver, resembling a dark-colored gray or greenish wax, and cutting like wax. Embolite, or Chloro-bromide of Stiver, like the last, but more greenish. These ores yield silver easily when heated on charcoal. Besides these, Tetraiiedrite, or Gray Copper, is often a valuable silver ore; Galena, which, although"], [10, "6 seldom yielding more than 74 ounces to the ton, allbrds a con siderable part of the silver of commerce. There arc also other rarer silver ores. Copper. \u2014 The more valuable species are : Native CoprER. Chalcopyrite, or Copper Pyrites,oi a brass-yellow color, scratched easily with the point ofa knife-blade, and giving a greenish-black powder. Barnhardtite and Cuban, which are similar to the last, but paler. Erubescite, or Purple Copper, pale yellowish, with a slight coppery tinge, but tarnishing externally to purple, blue, and reddish tints ; easily scratched with a knife-blade, and powder grayish. Copper Glance, or Vitreous Copper, of a dark lead-gray color, and powder similar ; resembling some silver ores, but yielding copper, and not silver, when heated on charcoal. Tetraiiedrite, or Gray Copper, of a somewhat paler steel-gray color and powder. Red Copper, Black Copper, Malachite, or Green Carbonate of Copper, of a bright green color, sometimes earthy in the fracture, and sometimes silky. Azurite, or Blue Malachite, of a rich deep blue color, either earthy or vitreous in lustre. \u2014 (All the above are acted on by nitric acid, and the solution deposits a red coating of copper on a strip of polished iron.) Chrysocolla, or Silicate of Copper, resembling the Green Car bonate, but paler green, and usually having a close texture (never fibrous), a smoother surface, and somewhat waxy lustre, although occurring usually only as an incrustation. Atacamite, or Chloride of Copper, of deeper green than Malachite. Sulphate of Copper in solution. There are many rarer ores. Quicksilver, or Mercury. \u2014 The only valuable ore is Cin nabar, of a bright red to brownish-black color, with always a red powder, and affording fumes of quicksilver when heated on charcoal. There is also Native Quicksilver, Amalgam, Selenide, Chloride and Iodide. Tetrahedrite sometimes contains this metal. lead. \u2014 Galena is the only abundant lead ore ; it is a lead gray brittle ore, yielding lead when heated with charcoal. There are many rare ores of this metal, consisting of Selenides, Vanadiates Tungstates, Chromates, Sulphates (of which Anglesite is the com mon one), Phosphates, Arsenates, Molybdates, fye."], [11, "7 Zinc. \u2014 The most important ores are : SmTnsoNiTE, or Carbo nate of Zinc; Calamine, or Silicate of Zinc. They are alike in a white, grayish-white, or greenish-white color, commonly a slight waxy lustre and smooth look (often stalactitic or mammillary), yet sometimes earthy, aud a hardness such that the surface is scratched with a knife-blade with some little difficulty. They differ in their action with Hydrochloric acid ; when the surface is drusy, the silicate shows projections of minute rectangular prisms. Zincite, or Red Zinc Ore, is also important ; it is a bright red, and very distinctly foliated. Blende, or Sulphide of Zinc, is a common ore, having a yellow to black color and resinous lustre, and dis tinctly cleavable ; the black varieties are sometimes a little metal lic in lustre, but the powder is nearly or quite white. The other ores of Zinc are Sulphates, Phosphates, Arsenates, fye. Cobalt, Nickel. \u2014 The ores of Cobalt of first importance are Smaltine and Cobaltine, both of nearly a tin-white color, with the powder grayish-black color, sometimes verging slightly to gray. The Black Oxide of Cobalt, a kind of bog ore, and very impure, is sometimes sufficiently abundant to be valuable. The useful ores of Nickel are : Chloanthite, or the Nickeliferous Smaltine; Gersdorffite, or Nickel Glance; aud Copper Nickel ; the latter distinguished by a pale copper-red color. The other ores of Cobalt are Sulphides, Arsenides, Sulphates, Arsenates, Carbonates, fye. ; of Nickel, Sulphides, Arsenides, Silicates, Sulphates, Arsenates, Carbonates, fye. Manganese. \u2014 Common, as Pyrolusite and Psilomelane, both black, or grayish-black ores, and having little lustre, and a blackish streak or powder, in which last particular they are dis tinct from the iron ore called Limonite, with which they are often associated, and also from Hematite, or Specular Iron. Wad is an earthy bog Manganese, sometimes abundant and valuable. Manganite is abundant in certain mines, but is of little value in the arts, because of its containing so little oxygen (one-third less than Pyrolusite), to which fact Bf.audant alludes in his name for the species, Acerdese ; it differs from Pyrolusite in its reddish brown powder. The other Manganese ores are Sulphides, Arsen ides, Oxides, Silicates, Phosphates, Carbonates, fye."], [12, "8 Chromium. \u2014 CnROMic Iron, a grayish-black, little lustrous ore, oecuring mostly in Serpentine, is the source of chrome in the arts. The chrome ores are Chromates. Iron. \u2014 The important ores are : Hematite, or Specular Iron (the bloodstone of Theophrastus), characterized by its blood-red powder, and occurring either earthy and red, or metallic and dark steel-gray; in the latter condition very hard, a knife-point making no impression. Magnetite, or Magnetic Iron Ore, as hard as the preceding, but having a black powder, and being attractable by a magnet. Limonite, called also Brown Hematite, a softer hydrous ore, affording a brownish-yellow powder ; earthy or semi metallic in appearance, and often in mammillary or stalactitic forms. Chalybite, or Spathic Iron, a sparry ore of grayish, grayish-brown, and brown colors, very distinctly cleavable, turning brown to black on exposure. The common clayey iron ores are impure ores, either of Spathic Iron, Limonite, or Hematite ; when the last, they are red ; when brown, reddish-brown, or yellowish-brown to black, they may be either of the two former. One of the most common ores of iron is Pyrites, or Sulphide of Iron, a pale yellow brass-like ore, hard enough to strike fire with steel, and thus unlike any copper ore, and all similar ores of other metals. Marcasite is similar, but is prismatic and often crested iu its forms. Pyrrhotine, or Magnetic Pyrites, is less hard and paler, or more grayish in color. Leucopyrite and Mispickel are white metallic arsenical ores, somewhat resembling ores of Cobalt. Ilmenite, or Titanic Iron, resembles Specular Iron closely, but has not a red powder ; it is abundant in some regions. The other ores of iron are Arsenates, Sulphates, Oxalates, Phos phates, fye. Tin \u2014 The only valuable ore is Cassiterite, or the Oxide of Tin, a very hard mineral, of a dark brown to black color, some times gray or grayish -brown, without any metallic appearance. The crystals usually have a very brilliant lustre. Tin also occurs as a sulphide, and is sparingly found in ores of Tantalum and some other mineral species. Titanium.\u2014 The only ore of this metal of any value is RUTILE."], [13, "9 Arsenic. \u2014 Native Arsenic is too rare to be of much avail ; Orpiment, a sulphur-yellow foliaceous and somewhat pearly mineral ; and Realgar, bright red and vitreous. Arsenic is mostly derived for the arts from the arsenical ores of Iron, Cobalt, and Nickel. Antimony. \u2014 Stibnite, or Gray Antimony, is the source of the antimony of commerce. It is a lead-gray ore, usually fibrous or in prismatic crystals, and distinguished from a similar ore of Manganese by its perfect diagonal cleavage and its easy fusibility. Antimony occurs also in numerous ores of Lead and Silver, of Nickel, and also as oxides. Bismuth. \u2014 Native Bismuth, the source of the metal in the arts, is whitish, with a faint reddish tinge, has a perfect cleavage, and is very fusible. Other Bismuth ores are : the oxides, a silicate, and a carbonate. li"], [14, ""], [15, "CATALOGUE. T. Is attached to mineral* from the Thomson, and K. from the Krantc collection. 1.

It is generally discovered in the top of the cliff's, two or three feet below the surface, enclosed between two stones set edgeways, and covered with a third, and mingled with a few bones of some animal. Sometimes many of them are found in the adjoining ground near the surface, and it is observable that where they lie seems to be made ground. They are of a round'forni, from one to two or three inches and a half in di;imeter, and a quarter of an inch thick ; one side is flat, the other convex, on which are several mould ings ; on the flat side are two, sometimes four, small round holes near the brim (perhaps the centre holes by which they were fixed to the turning lathe), but they do not penetrate through the piece. Antiquaries conclude them to be British antiquities, but whether amulets or money is not agreed ; the amulets described by Camden and Stokely differ from these in form and materials. It may be observed that coal is the cant word for money ; whence, \" Down with your coal \" is a cant expression in some counties for \" Pay your money.\" There was lately found near the shore a bowl made of Kimmeridge coal, about six inches in diameter, but shallow, and six inches high ; in it were several pieces of the coal money.\u2014 Hutchins' History of Dorsetshire, vol. 1, p. 197. It is evident that the coal money has been turned in a lathe. The mould ings and ornaments have been formed with great neatness and precision ; and no greater proof of the indestructibility of the material of which they have been formed can be adduced, than the sharpness of the fine edges to which the coal money had in many instances been reduced. I likewise found, among this curious assemblage of substances, a piece of Kimmeridge coal or slate, on which were traced, with mathematical exactness, circles and various angles. The fishermen who inhabit this bay informed me that some years ago the coal money was more abundant, and several large pieces had been found, on which, they affirmed, some kind of character was visible."], [18, "14 I mention this circumstance as relating to the coal money, and, although sceptically inclined, cannot but consider that formerly a species of these relics had been found, differing from what are now discovered, since many persons unconnected with each other have persisted in a similar account; and it is to be regretted that these specimens had not been preserved by some person in the neighborhood. The sea, however, makes rapid en croachments on this cliff, and during the memory of man many feet have crumbled into the watery surf. It was after a severe gale that the thigh bones of a human skeleton, projecting from the side of the cliff, attracted the attention of some laboring men, who, under the idea of wealth, rudely demolished the simple tomb, hurled the bones down the precipice, and dis covered the skull resting on an urn, containing coal money. The skeleton was lying between two ranges of flat stones, set perpendicularly, so as to support other flat ones, which formed a cover not unlike a present drain or gutter. The urn was unfortunately destroyed by these men, who were not aware of any gentlemen in their neighborhood likely to purchase the vase, and the only record of this discovery is the impression it made on their minds. The bay of Kimmeridge is of greater extent than that of Worthbarrow, and is bounded semicircularly by the sweep of the southern range of high land, which passes through Purbeck. Its cliffs present a dark and gloomy appearance, being entirely composed of a bituminous shale peculiar to this spot. \u25a0 The coal money was deposited in the cliffs, about one foot and a half beneath the surface, and the general mass of the soil was similar to that of Worthbarrow, but blacker and richer, the animal bones and other remains, especially pottery, being more frequent. A number of large stones, rounded by the action of water, form a kind of foundation to this artificial soil or made earth, while the coal money occupied the mid depth. The specimens of the money were various as to ornaments, circumference, thick ness, and the number of holes, in which some instrument appears to have been inserted, to hold it when in the process of turning. The large pieces have never more than three holes, or, if one only, it is a large square one in the centre ; the smaller ones having in rare instances four, and even five holes, although two and three appear to be the usual number. On some pieces, when three holes have been used, I observed an isosceles triangle to be marked, and at each angle is a hole. Several fragments of the Kim meridge material were discovered, and in one instance a piece on which a circle was marked, and a centre point is visible, similar to the circles on the piece before mentioned as having been found at Worthbarrow. These fragments, I observe, are always more inclined to fall into pieces than the well-turned coal money ; and, from a greasy white matter which adheres to the coal money after a long immersion in water, it would appear that their state of preservation arises from some animal or vegetable substance being used on them in former times. In a few instances, parts of rings made of the shale are to be found, and they appear to have been not only exquisitely turned, but even highly polished.\u2014 From Description of the"], [19, "15 Deveril Barrow, and Minute Account of the Kimmeridge Coal Money, by Wm. Augustus Miles, p. 41. It is evident that the people who inhabited the spot were acquainted with the method of carving stone, since I found a large portion of a shallow circular patera, not destitute of elegance, and formed of granite. But the most decisive and singular point which has hitherto come under my actual observation, and which throws a more decided light upon the use of what is called coal money, is a cist on the edge of the cliff, containing a sacrifice. At various times I had observed several small flints, of which the sharp edge of the fracture appeared chipped and blunted. At first I disregarded this point; but, on observing it in several instances, it struck me they had been used in turning the coal money, and on mentioning my remarks to the Rev. Mr. Witt, of Stoke, my suspicions were confirmed, as he informed me that by repeated experiments he found no steel, however tempered, could retain its edge when opposed to the rapidity of the coal in the lathe, and that the most convenient method of shaping this material was by applying the sides of flints, when a fresh fracture would generally present a fresh edge. As it is evident, from remains of pottery, and also from topographical situation, that neither Kimmeridge nor Worthbarrow were British or Roman settlements, it becomes a point worthy of investigation, at this remote period, what nations inhabited these bays, and what inducement could have led them to shores where nature, in her wildest moods, presents a chain of inhospitable cliffs. From the defenceless condition of those who dwelt in these bays, it is a reasonable conclusion that they were a nautical, but not a belligerent race; and, as navigation is the child of commerce, they must have been a commercial colony. It is evident that they were workers of the finest pottery, and offerers of sacrifice, since I have found the fine black pottery in abundance, with fragments of the fine red lamian, and likewise the sacrificial deposit of a bullock's head, as previously described. These relics cannot be attributed to either the Danes or the Saxons, and the mystery of the coal money bespeaks a far greater antiquity. Thus unable to fix our conclusions upon the Saxons, Danes, Romans, or Britons, and bearing in mind the certain evidences of a polished and mercantile race, it cannot appear an idle hypothesis to ascribe this site to a Ph\u0153nician or Carthaginian colony. It may be asked, what inducement led the Ph\u0153nician to Kimmeridge, where no mines existed ? Strabo relates that, in exchange for skins, tin, and other objects of traffic, the Ph\u0153nicians gave pottery, &c. Now, since a district of clay is in the isle of Purbeck, it is more probable that the foreign trader availed himself of this clay, and, as if nature assisted his pursuits, he had only to bring this clay to Kimmeridge, where there are enormous cliffs, composed of a coal which would burn the vases ; and thus, in lieu of sailing from their native ports loaded with exported potteries, they found clay and coal contiguous in Purbeck, and there established a manufactory. In farther corroboration of the Ph\u0153nician having availed himself of the clay, the coal money and pottery similar to what is found at Kimmeridge have"], [20, "16 been discovered in two instances in the clay district; and I have found fragments of clay at Kimmeridge intermixed and connected with the coal money. These points prove a cpnnecting link between the clay and the coal districts, and, tending to support my conjectures, will rescue them from the imputation of being idle or visionary. Relative to the original use of these mysterious manufactured articles, I cannot consider them to have been used as a circulating currency, nor as charms or amulets, nor as ornaments, but as representatives of coin, and of some mystical use in sacrificial or sepulchral rites. \u2014 Thomson. 31.

Sulphide of Antimony. \u2014 Amorphous and Capil lary, Gray Antimony, Crude Antimony, T. \u2014 Schemnitz, Hungary. \u2014 This mineral is the source of the supply of commercial antimony. The mode of operation is a simple one. Antimony ore is fused in a chamber or retort, by the application of burning wood ; the melted sulphide leaves the stony matrix, and is allowed to run into receivers ; this is the crude antimony of commerce. The crude antimony is then roasted, and afterwards fused with charcoal and carbonate of soda ; then re-fused, for the"], [24, "20 purpose of purification. The process is not considered complete until the metallic antimony forms, in cooling, beautiful star-like crystallizations on the surface ; it is then known as star antimony. This metal is used in the manufacture of type metal, stereotype metal, music plate, Britannia metal, pewter, &c. ; also for medical purposes ; and is capable of forming excellent paints and pigments, a fact worthy of consideration in connection with the antimony ores found in this colony. 104.
