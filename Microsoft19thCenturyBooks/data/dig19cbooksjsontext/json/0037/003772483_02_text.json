The whole of the south of Italy passes under the denomination of the kingdom of Naples. It is of considerable extent ; abounds in every necessary as well as luxury of life ; and, but for the mutual benefit and convenience to be de rived from commerce, stands in need of nothing from its neighbours ofthe apostolic states. VOL. il. B"], [18, "2 NAPLES. From the extreme mildness of its climate, and the salubrity of its air, the inhabitants require little or no animal food. They live, therefore, principally on fish, maccaroni, cheese, vegetables, salted pork, and sausages; and, though wine is to be met with in great abun dance and at a very reasonable rate, it seldom or never happens that a Neapolitan is seen in the streets in a state of intoxication. The Neapolitans are more attached to their country than any other Italians, and not less so to their masters or employers ; though they are generally looked upon as great votaries of Mercury, the god of fraud and of theft. The common people, and the domestics of both sexes, sleep and cook their provisions on the staircases of their master's palaces. They live with their families like beasts in a stable ; are excessively dirty in their persons ; and wear scarcely any clothing in their early youth. They are extremely slothful and super stitious ; and are at least a couple of centuries behind the rest of Italy, in the point of civiliza tion. The Neapolitan nobility, when they either build or rent a palace, never dream of providing offices for their servants ; but leave them to shift for themselves, in the best way they can. Ferdinand, their sovereign, speaks the same"], [19, "3 NAPLES. corrupted Neapolitan dialect that is used by the common people ; and in his manners, cus toms, habits, and conversation, is to all intents and1 purposes as much one of the lazzaroni, as any of his subjects. It is to this very similarity of habits and pursuits, that he was indebted for the greater portion of his popularity. As Gene ral Acton, his tall minister, once observed, \" Ferdinand is a good sort of man, because nature has not supplied him with the faculties necessary to make a bad one.\" The character of the natives may be pretty fairly collected, from the title page to a book, which gives an account of the revolution against the tyranny of one of the Viceroys of Naples, headed by the famous Massaniello, the fisher man, which runs thus : \u2014 \" the Seventeenth Revolution of the most faithful Subjects of his Sicilian Majesty.\" The eighteenth, however, took place, sanctioned by the king of this ver satile people ; and Ferdinand himself, at Lay bach, occasioned the nineteenth, against these \" his most faithful subjects;\" who have, in con sequence, totally revolutionized their once un bounded love, into complete and entire hatred. This measure is, however, considered to have been forced upon Ferdinand, by the self-created and arbitrary tribunal erected at Laybach, b 2"], [20, "4 N A P L E S. which sat in judgment on the future destinies of a great portion of the inhabitants of civilized Europe ; and therefore to have justified him in declaring, that \" he swore to adhere to the new order of things dictated to him, because, by refusing to do so, his personal safety would have been endangered ; that he was ever averse to any change taking place in the government of his kingdom; and solely agreed to the establish ment of a parliament in Sicily, because it was at that time under the controul of Lord William Bentinck.\" This same parliament, however, since the Austrians have taken possession of the country, has been abolished. . The question still remains to be solved, whe ther it would have been wiser and more honour able, in an independent sovereign like Ferdinand, to have submitted to the arbitrary dictatorship of a self-styled \" Holy Alliance,\" of three foreign powers, and to have depended on their armies for a precarious and odious existence, or to have become a limited, constitutional king, without any personal responsibility? Time will most probably convince him, which of the alternatives he ought to have embraced ; if, indeed, he be not already instructed thereon. It has been repeatedly found, that on account of the turbulent and boisterous manner in which"], [21, "NAPLES. 5 the Neapolitan troops conduct themselves, when marching in a body, whereby they make known their approach, long before they come in contact with the enemy, no operations of a secret nature can be entrusted to them. Unless, therefore, they are drafted into different foreign corps, or mixed up with well-disciplined regiments, it would be hazardous to trust them ; since, both from their strong propensity to plunder and to run away, especially when left to fight by them selves on their own soil, little can be expected from them when isolated from other troops, and commanded by native officers, in whom they have no confidence. In short, the Neapolitan soldiers never fought, under their own banners, for Ferdinand their king; nor for Murat, when he was dethroned; nor even for their own independence. They may be considered as twin brothers of the Spaniards ; and, a thousand pities it is, that two such delightful countries should be contaminated and cursed by such a pestiferous race! If. I might venture an opinion, I should say, that instead of driving the Turks out of Europe, a step whicli has been proposed as the surest way of preventing the plague from making any fur ther progress in the civilized world, it would be b 3"], [22, "\u25a00 NAPLES. infinitely better to send off the two above-men tioned infected races in their stead ; for no plague can by possibility be more fatal to the progress of civilization, than the dissemination of their deadly infection. With respect to the army, as a plea for the numerous desertions, the old story is adduced, of their want of confidence in their leaders, and their never having seen fire but from the crater of Mount Vesuvius, or in their own kitchens when cooking their much-loved maccaroni ; most of them being recruits who, in their marches, committed such depredations and plunderings, that the Austrian army was actually considered by the people, not as their future oppressors, but as their immediate deliverers. An event, this, which could never have oc curred, if the troops, as had hitherto been the case, had been commanded and led into action by foreign officers. That the Neapolitans are not cowards by nature, we have a well-attested proof, in their having supplied Buonaparte with a body of troops, which, as long as Murat had personally the command of them, proved the most efficient force on which he could depend, both in his ridiculous expedition to Moscow, and in his"], [23, "7 NAPLES. precipitate retreat therefrom ; by covering which retreat, they prevented his immediate destruction. I have been informed, that the Neapolitan troops were disbanded by their general, sans ceremonie, as a master would send about his business a servant whom he wished to dismiss ; without making the smallest provision for them, or taking the least precaution for their sub sistence; but leaving them to plunder their way home, without even subaltern officers to regulate their marches. I have further been assured, that the same general greatly terrified and alarmed the king; imposing upon his credulity exaggerated state ments, to induce him the more readily to sign his consent to the instalment of the new con stitution. The fraud was, however, detected ; and was the occasion of the defection in the civil and military operations, and of the disor ders which afterwards took place, and which still continue to disturb the tranquillity of that beautiful and highly favoured portion of Italy. The Neapolitan cavalry are fine men, even to a proverb ; and, as long as Murat could keep together a few hundreds of them, they would disperse large bodies of Cossacs, who would instantly fly, terrified at their very approach. b 4"], [24, "8 NAPLES. The misfortunes of Italy have been most aptly described in the following sentence: \u2014 \" Troppo bella, e troppo debole : nata sempre per servir ; vinta o vintrice.\" It has been the cruel and unnatural policy of all her barbarous and brutal invaders, ever since the destruction of the Roman empire, to keep the Italians in a state of internal division ; and Buonaparte, both from his historical information, and his own per sonal experience, was induced to adopt the maxim, \" divide et impera,\" as the only sure means of preserving his usurped dominion, against the powerful and even colossal union which would have been formed against it, had he suffered the seeds which he had brought with him from France, to have ripened in the rich soil of Italy. He, however, thought proper to nip and destroy them in the bud ; but, in so doing, he at the same time nipped and destroyed his own honour and glory, and secured his passage in the good ship Bellerophon, to the barren rock of Saint Helena ; there to reflect in solitude on his own treachery, and on the \" mutability of all human affairs ;\" \" Leaving a name at which the world grew pale, To point a moral or adorn a tale.\" When Buonaparte first arrived in Italy, he"], [25, "NAPLES. 9 entertained most imperfect notions, with regard to the country, and the capability of its inhabi tants. He was speedily, however, made sensible of his error ; and, being an eye-witness of its resources, and of the character of the people, he was soon convinced, that if Italy were once really and virtually united, she would again become the mistress of the civilized world. Whatever the French may say to the contrary, the whole of the fourth division of the army which invaded Russia, was composed of natives of the northern states of Italy, commanded by Prince Eugene Beauharnois ; and it is impos sible for any military man to reflect on their brilliant achievements, without feeling the most enthusiastic admiration for troops who were alone vanquished by those elementary generals, Novembri-off, Decembri-off, Januari-off, and their invincible forces. Since the time of the crossing of the Red Sea by the children of Israel, the Russians are, I believe, the only people who have had the good fortune to beassisted in their overthrow of an invading enemy, by the elements.* How righ- * I had forgotten our own Elizabeth, who was equally protected by Providence. When the tyrant, Philip the"], [26, "10 NAPLES. teous and just is God in all his ways ! He is, indeed, the best of commanders ; for the accom plishment of his commissions are never thwarted by bribery or corruption. The valour, the constancy, and the courage of the Italian army in Russia, were such as they ever had been in former times, and such as they ever will be, when commanded by bold and skilful generals. And, though the progress of the sacred flame of liberty and independence \u2014 which has never ceased to animate the breasts of every real Italian, from one end of that oppressed country to the other, \u2014 may, for a time, have been impeded, I can by no means bring myself to believe, that it is extinguished. In justification of their several unsuccessful military operations, let me adduce a few facts. Second of Spain, attempted the invasion of this happy country, \" His whole Armada of collected sail, Was, by a roaring tempest on the flood, Both scatter'd and disjoin'd from fellowship.\" On that occasion the eye of Heaven watched over the sea-girt isle, and protected her, and I trust ever will do, against the designs of violence, oppression, tyranny, and injustice."], [27, "11 NAPLES. Ever since the year 1793, the armies of the Emperor of Austria have been taught in the school of defeat ; in the same way as the Russian armies were in the time of Peter the Great. A circumstance this, which, above all others, is the most fatal to national courage. Yet I do not, on that account, seek to withhold from them the full measure of their deserts. The greater part of them are fine men ; but to the full as much savages as the Cossacks are ; most of them being either Croats, Dalmatians, Hun garians, Poles, or Albanians ; and all of them natives of uncivilized regions, They submit to strict discipline, and are by no means deficient in military ardour. What they stand in need of are motive and zeal ; for at present they are little better than brute machines, utterly desti tute of that energy and that high spirit of honour, which alone can prompt an army to deeds of mighty enterprize, and which indeed can alone be arrived at, from the valour of free nations, fighting in the righteous cause of liberty and independence.

Sed respice finem ! Let us watch the end of these puff and paste operations ; when we shall, I trust, be able to give the world a more faithful account of the real state of things, than is to be found in the pompous and high-sounding narratives, which fill us with columns of smoke ; which will not, I fear, be dispersed, until the Austrians shall have been compelled to withdraw themselves from the states of Piedmont, Naples, and Sicily, and return to their native homes. Then, and then only, will the real sentiments of the natives of Italy be allowed to circulate freely. Such a step, at the present crisis, would endanger their honour, the liberty they are looking forward to, and their lives ; as every thing is to be feared, while they continue under the immediate con troul of a military force, the greater part of which are feudal slaves, having no notion of"], [29, "13 NAPLES. civilization beyond the satisfying the common wants of brute nature, and being altogether insensible to the feelings of humanity and honour; and still less to those sentiments of pure patriotism, which warm the heart of every free-born subject with the love of national glory. This melancholy fact is sufficiently apparent from the history of their numerous campaigns, ever since their first invasion of Italy, under the veteran Wurmser ; that ill-fated general, who, with the whole of his army, were compelled to shut themselves up in Mantua, while Buona parte's hordes \u2014 for they were little better \u2014 were encamped, destitute of tents, in the open air ; without a fortress to cover their retreat, without provisions to support themselves in their present station, and without the means of advancing. These are facts which cannot be contradicted; and Marshal Alvinzi, being unacquainted with the topographical situation of the country, un supplied with maps, excepting a very incorrect one, which, to save expense, he had procured in a small village, was therefore reduced to the necessity, with an army of 20,000 men, for want of a proper line of march, to act upon the defensive, to prevent desertion. Wurmser might"], [30, "14 NAPLES. therefore have reversed the observation of the troops after the battle of the Boyne, \" Let us change generals, and we will fight the battle over again ;\" and might justly have said, \"Let me change soldiers with Buonaparte, and I am sure of gaining the victory.\" Indeed, military skill was never more thrown away than in those times, when ruses de guerre overcame regular military tactics \u2014 a mode of warfare which the low, mean, and avaricious conduct of Alvinzi fully justified ; and to which, in his turn, he was obliged to have recourse, to prevent his head-quarters and valuable stores from falling into the hungry jaws of the French ; but which he as little understood as he did the art of conquering. His operations reminded one of the conduct of the deaf cook, who, on being desired to make a dumpling, set about breaking the eggs to make a pancake ; so that at last it became a common saying among the French troops, \" Allons, mes enfans, Alvinzi bat les \u0153ufs, et Buonaparte fait l'omelette.\" To execute one of these left-handed ruses de guerre, Alvinzi contrived to send a trusty pea sant; who engaged to explore the enemy's position, their probable movements, and their precise strength, which was uniformly exagge rated, to the extent at least of one-third. This"], [31, "15 NAPLES. man was sometimes absent from his wife and family for days together, at the risk of his life. Upon one occasion, he brought back with him the most satisfactory as well as useful intel ligence ; for which extraordinary service, he was rewarded with the enormous sum of two Venetian ducats \u2014 about eighteen shillings ster ling ! This want of generosity to such a man, and on such an occasion, was the cause of the complete overthrow of the Austrian army ; for never afterwards could it procure the smallest intelligence to be depended upon./ The positions of every one of the battles, in point of ground, were infinitely more advanta geous to Wurmser than they were to Buona parte. But even impregnable situations were given up and abandoned by these troops, with a nonchalance which proved them to be as in sensible to their own fame, as they were to the cause of their country.

Every circumstance detailed by me, in the preceding chapter, has been collected by one who was frequently an eye-witness of the ope rations of both armies, both of the Austrians and of the French in Italy ; and who was some times within gunshot of the scene of action. From education, as well as from moral feelings, I am incapable of exaggeration in favour of the French ; neither am I an advocate for the debased principles of the revolutionists of that"], [33, "17 NAPLES. country. I say \" debased,\" because the natural character of that nation, under all its various forms of government, has invariably tended to the same end \u2014 namely, that of invading every other country, and of contaminating it with their vile doctrines ; and which conduct has been one of the principal reasons why France, in her turn, has been ultimately overrun, sub dued, humiliated, and conquered, by nations the most barbarous and the most uncivilized in all Europe. I received my early education in that once polite and polished country. I know the French, when esteemed good, to have been good for nothing \u2014 but themselves ! France is per haps the only country in Europe, which esti mates foreign talents and foreign productions, not by their intrinsic value or merits, but merely as they are calculated to be useful to herself. A Frenchman can discover no worth in any thing that is not the growth of his own soil. If any one were to talk to a Frenchman on the perfections of paradise, he would immediately turn on his heel and exclaim, \" Mais, Monsieur, ce n'est rien en comparaison de Paris !\" though he had, perhaps, never seen that much-vaunted capital, nor gone beyond the barrier of his own miserable town. VOL. II. c"], [34, "18 NAPLES. As an impartial writer, and an eye-witness of most of the events which took place at that memorable period, I nevertheless feel myself bound in candour to confess, that the French in Italy carried every thing before them, in consequence of their being, in character, in manners, in language, and in conduct, more congenial to the habits and disposition of the polished Italians, than the rude, uncultivated, insolent, and braggart Austrians ; who had no other object in view, but that of carrying with them out of the provinces they govern, every thing they could get, without spending therein a single stiver. Nor, until the Italians are either brutalized down to the German manners, or the Germans raised up to the civilization of the enlightened Italians, can there be any approach to a cordial understanding between them. The man who flatters himself to the contrary must be totally ignorant of that mutual dislike which has, which still does, and which ever must subsist between nations so totally uncongenial in their natures. To the cause I have already assigned may be attributed the astonishing defeats of the Aus trians, under General Melas, their loss of all Italy, and the enthusiastic joy with which the people of that country received the conqueror,"], [35, "NAPLES. 19 after one of the most unaccountable and most complete routs that ever was heard of. It would, indeed, be far beyond my humble abili ties to describe the universal sensation of delight which it occasioned. It can better be con ceived, than described by the feeble pen of a female ; though her heart beats warm in the cause ofthe injured. The following anecdote will illustrate still further the amazing difference between the spirit which sets in motion a mass of feudal slaves, and that which actuates an army of free born soldiers : for such the French troops were, or at least considered themselves to be ; as Buonaparte had not, at that time, chilled their military ardour, by throwing over it the wet blanket of Imperialism \u2014 though the army was, of necessity, the only class, in his extended empire, which did not immediately feel the weight of those fetters that galled the rest of his subjects. I was myself coming from Genoa on the very day upon which the battle of Marengo took place. The overflow of the Scrivia hin dered me from proceeding, and obliged me to stop at an inn, at no great distance from the field of action. We had scarcely alighted from our carriage, and were coolly taking a lun- c 2"], [36, "20 NAPLES. cheon, when a French officer entered, who was flying to prepare horses for the escape of Buo naparte, who was then closely pursued by the Germans. This officer must have been well known to the innkeeper, as he greatly interested himself in procuring him a disguise, the more effectually to forward his immediate escape. The French drums were beating the retreat. He entered the room in which we were sitting, and exclaimed, \" Sauvez moi ; sauvez moi : tout est perdu!\" We entreated him to sit-down and tranquillize himself, until the landlord should return with the clothes which were to disguise him. It was with much difficulty that we could prevail on him not to take off his uniform and throw it into the cistern. But, whilst we were assuring him, that as soon as the flood subsided we would give him a seat in our car riage, where he would be safe to pursue his journey, the town was suddenly filled with the French troops, and the whole country resounded with shouts, that the French had gained the battle. In a short time after a division entered, bearing the colours of the victors. The afore said officer nearly fainted at this unexpected turn in the wheel of dame Fortune ; and, think ing no more of us, he flew, with the rapidity of lightning, put on his uniform, belted on his"], [37, "21 NAPLES. sword, embraced several of the soldiers, and was instantly out of sight, in quest of the head quarters of Buonaparte. It was afterwards reported to us at Novarra, where we stopped several days, that General Melas had engaged the French with 20,000 men, and had then in reserve at least 10,000 fresh troops, who had never been brought into action, and were only waiting his orders. The reason assigned for his not employing them was, his having discovered some treachery, or a want of courage, amongst those who had been com manded by other officers ; and that to save himself, as well as the few who had fought and remained faithful to him, from being cut to pieces by French enthusiasm, he had entered into a capitulation with Buonaparte, and given up to him all the strong fortresses in Italy. Thus was this beautiful country, a second time, in the complete possession of the French ! As reverses, and contre-temps like these so repeatedly befel the Austrian armies under the command of this scientific, accomplished, and experienced master in the art of man-kilhng, what could reasonably be expected from the undisciplined hordes of Lazzaroni, and the young and inexperienced Piedmontese, seduced by one, and betrayed by the other, as they were c 3"], [38, "22 NAPLES. accustomed to be while engaged in the heat of battle ? Had the regiments of either of the last-mentioned troops been commanded by vete ran chiefs, uninfluenced by self-interest or by self-preservation, convinced am I, that they would never have been found to have aban doned their standards. This extraordinary stroke of decided good fortune, so soon after Buonaparte's return to France from his ill-fated Egyptian expedition, was the grand spring that put in motion and gave birth to, the conqueror's adoption of a totally new career. He no longer openly avowed himself to be a votary of democracy ; on the contrary, he became the declared advocate of his long-sigh ed-for plan of reviving the aris tocratical system, by vaccinating his own worthy Ajaccian family with the pus of monarchy ; and thus did he attain, step by step, that eminence of oligarcical imperialism, which eventually turned out so fatal to him ! The first experiment was tried, and with complete success, on that poor, ricketty- framed footstool of a prince, the King of Etrutria ; whose untimely death left a widowed Queen to further the good work of king-making. It was proposed that she should be honoured, by being made the better half, encircled with a crown,"], [39, "23 NAPLES. of Lucien Buonaparte, his brother ; but the Spanish soil not being propitious for Corsican seed, the tree of liberty was rooted up, to give place to the tree of kings. The fruit it pro duced were the crowns of Bavaria, of Wurtem berg, of Westphalia, of Spain, and of Naples ; besides many other lesser dignities for princes and princesses, and dukes and duchesses. So well did the tree flourish in the soil of Austria, that it brought a little king to a great nation ; and, peradventure, if this said tree had not been blighted in its growth, eventually it might have become the tree of all trees. It has often been asserted, that Lucien Buo naparte could never be prevailed on to repudiate his lawful wife. But, previously to this, his brother Napoleon had shewn his propensity for the aristocracy, by uniting his sister Pauline, the widow of General Le Clere, to the Roman prince, Camillo Borghese ; now the cher ami of the pretty Duchess of Lanti. Napoleon's next attempt at royal inocula tion was upon Eugene Beauharnois, whom he joined to the Princess Amelia Augusta, daughter of the King of Bavaria ; and by which alliance he succeeded in detaching that sovereign from the interest of Austria. c 4"], [40, "24 NAPLES. The third royal alliance was brought about by compelling his brother Jerome to divorce his wife, the rich and beautiful Miss Patterson, and to honour the hand of the Princess Cathe rine, eldest daughter of the Duke of Wurtem berg ; whom he made King of Wurtemberg, as he did Jerome of Westphalia : both which king doms were of the Buonaparte manufactory. By these alliances he greatly strengthened his fron tier interest in Italy; towards France on one side, and towards Austria on the other. The next batch from the Buonaparte oven was the elevation of his brother Joseph to the throne of Naples ; and afterwards, on his over throwing king, queen, prince, and minister, making him the short-lived monarch of Spain. His brother Louis, and his favourite daughter in-law, Hortensia Beauharnois, were saddled, as king and queen, upon the phlegmatic Dutch, by whom they were much beloved ; for Louis was not a king of the olden times, but did every thing in his power to propitiate their welfare and happi ness ; which, as they give out, had not been greatly promoted either by the Prussian blue, or the Russian fax. Next come our dearly-beloved sisters, Pau lina, Eliza, and Caroline ; who were all three"], [41, "25 NAPLES. converted either into queens, or princesses, or grand-duchesses. Last, \" though not least in our royal favour,\" come the minor branches of the Great Family, Stephanie de Beauharnois, married to the Grand- Duke of Baden, and consequently become Grand-Duchess, and Mademoiselle Tescher, made Princess d' Aremberg ; both nieces of the Empress Josephine. Neither Lucien nor Joseph Buonaparte choos ing to barter plebeian flesh and blood for king doms and crowns, by separating from their lawful spouses, Napoleon thought fit to throw off the mask, and finally, to complete the climax of his unbounded ambition, repudiated Jose phine, for the purpose of marrying the Arch- Duchess Maria Louisa, daughter of the Em peror of Austria ; which marriage was like a de profundis to a departed soul. By this one act, he obscured all his former brilliant achieve ments. It has been asserted, that of all the alliances which he formed, the one that flattered Buona parte's vanity the most, was his own ; and that after he had lost the battle of Waterloo, this relationship struck him as the one on which he could best rely. Ashe knew he was much in favour with the Queen Dowager of Wurtemberg and his"], [42, "26 NAPLES. sister-in-law, who were both nearly allied to the Court of Great Britain, he flattered himself that, by their interest, and the influence of Lord Holland in the House of Peers, he should be suffered to come to London and remain in Eng land ; in the same way that his brother Lucien had been during his exile. Indeed, it is be lieved, that his family were divided between England and Austria, and that he himself put an end to their doubts, by saying, \" I am deter mined not to go to Austria, who has betrayed me : I will throw myself on England ; at least for the present.\" When Lady Holland and family were at Venice, she told a lady, who called on his Lord ship, from the respect which she bore to the memory of his uncle, the immortal Charles Fox, in the presence of Lord Charles Fitzgerald and another English gentleman, that the reason why the Queen Dowager of Wurtemberg was not permitted to come to England, was because of her known partiality for Napoleon, and her hav ing been the prime agent in bringing about the marriage of the Princess Catherine with Jerome Buonaparte. From the very moment of his taking the name of Napoleon, he became the mere shadow of his former self. Had he but remained firmly at-"], [43, "27 NAPLES. tached to the pure and sturdy principles of republicanism, the savage and despotic seeds of the North would never have over-run the soil of the South ; that soil which had been bathed with the rich blood of liberty. He not only disgusted every member of his own family, from the humiliations to which he subjected them, in consequence of his marrying this second Empress ; but he alienated from himself the affections of the whole French na tion. Nor was this new wife more disliked for the haughty demeanour with which she con ducted herself at court, than for the simple fact of her having ascended a throne, the foot steps of which had been stained with the blood of her grand-aunt. For though Maria Louisa bore but a faint, a very faint, resemblance to the once most beautiful and most amiable of her sex, the sight of her, in that very place where Marie Antoinette had filled, occasioned many a bitter pang in the bosoms of some of her cruel persecutors. The most confidential friends of Buonaparte, in their endeavours to justify this second mar riage, have affirmed, that his motive was not so much the having an heir to his throne ; as he had long before settled that that heir should be the son of his favourite daughter-in-law, Hortensia"], [44, "28 NAPLES. Beauharnois ; who, in compliance with his wishes, had united herself to his brother Louis ; whom he afterwards created King of Holland, and whose son, though an infant, was then at Paris, for the purpose of being educated under Napoleon's immediate eye. In case of the death of this youth, Eugene Beauharnois was to have been the successor to the throne of France. He however deceived both of them, and made them his private enemies, by divorcing their mother Josephine and marrying Maria Louisa ; which he was induced to do, in order to unite himself the more firmly with Austria, against Russia, as well as to detach the Queen of Na ples from the influence of England ; which he hoped thereby to accomplish. There can be no doubt that his conduct was as strongly stimulated by these political consi derations, as it was by private ambition, to be come allied to the House of Austria ; to which ambition he fell a victim, from the enslaving and benumbing effects which it had upon all his other faculties ; his whole conduct, both public and private, having, from the moment he be came the husband of Maria Louisa, undergone a total change. It is well known, that scarcely had this mar-"], [45, "29 NAPLES. riage been consummated, before a private cor respondence, of the most affectionate and flat tering description, was entered upon, by emis saries from the court of France to that of Naples. What effect it produced, I leave Lord William Bentinck to disclose, as well as the conduct which he pursued after he had been put in pos session of the fact. That Buonaparte intended to remove Murat from Naples, there remains not a shadow of a doubt. Salicetti was sent thither for the express purpose ; and his monstrous plunderings and dilapidations were winked at, in order to under mine Murat's popularity. This man was one of the principal agents of all Buonaparte's pri vate intrigues ; and, by the unlimited resources which he was suffered to have at his disposal, he became a successful agent in realizing his mas ter's gigantic projects. It was Buonaparte's intention to have created two new kingdoms in the North, by way of checks upon Austria and Russia ; one between Prussia and Russia, including the whole of Poland ; the other between Russia and Sweden, including some islands in the Baltic, as well as all Finland. One of these kingdoms was in tended for Murat, by way of compensation for consenting to give up Naples : while, to some of"], [46, "30 NAPLES. the members of the court of Palermo, he held out the language of conscience, with regard to the justice of their claims ; and, as drowning men are apt to catch at straws, they were drawn into the snare, from an over sanguine hope of recovering Naples : and, from the long wished for idea of shaking off the English yoke in Sicily, did they thus become the victims of their own credulity. That a correspondence was carried on be tween Buonaparte, Murat, the Salicetti agents, and some members of the court of Palermo, is very certain : and, if the Queen should have been one of them, it would indeed be surpris ing ; since, at various critical periods of the French revolution, the author of these pages has had the honour of conversing with this extraordinary lady, and on every occasion she was wont to express her abhorrence, not only of French interference in the island, but of the whole French nation, ever since the horrid mur der of her sister, Marie Antoinette, at Paris, on the 15th of October 1793, a day which she always held in sad remembrance ! That her majesty should have suffered herself to be over ruled, can alone be attributed to the all-seducing desire of reigning ; in the hope of avenging herself on the enemies who had calumniated"], [47, "31 NAPLES. and dethroned her. For that, and that alone, could possibly have so blinded a woman of her astonishing sagacity, as to have induced her to give credence to the assertions of one, whose thirst after universal dominion had exceeded the limits of his own vast calculations ; and who, besides, had always been her most impla cable enemy. Buonaparte's views of aggrandizement were unlimited ; and, in this want of limits to his am bition, is to be discovered the real cause of the non-duration of his power. Without a key-stone a building must fall under its own weight. I happened to be at Paris in the year 1803, whenBuonaparte was made First Consul, and was introduced to his mother, Madame Letitia. I complimented the old lady on the good fortune and great talents of her son : to which she replied, in a very affable manner, \" Bless me, Madame ! do you fancy that a First Consulship will satisfy him ? O, no : the world is too small for the vast notions of my son.\" But, it is time for me to return to the affairs of Naples."], [48, "32 CHAPTER III. NAPLES.

Though, in the eyes of all Europe, the Nea politans are labouring under a national stigma, it is, I think, not impossible that their several miscarriages may be attributed more to credu lity, and the great confidence they reposed in their sovereign's determination to support what he had sworn to defend, than to natu ral cowardice. All the Neapolitans now residing in London, who have been actively employed in the revo lution sanctioned by their sovereign, and who have only been able to find a shelter from per secution in this land of hospitality, declare,"], [49, "33 NAPLES. most solemnly, that in order to serve his own selfish purposes, one of the revolutionary gene rals (now also in this country) grossly deceived the King of Naples, by so exaggerating the numbers of the mal-contents, as to induce him, through intimidation, to hasten the organization of the new constitution, merely for the purpose of thereby securing his own safety ; fancying, from the versatile disposition, and the love of revolutions, \" delfidelissimo popolo di sua maesta delle due Sicilie,\" that, when out of danger and at a distance from Naples, he could revoke at pleasure those acts which the turbulent spirit of the moment had compelled him to sanction. After the king had sworn to maintain the constitution, and the troops had returned to Naples, under the command of General Pepe, headed by the first lieutenant Morelli, and the second lieutenant Silvati, those officers, for their noble and valorous conduct, were proclaimed generals of the army by the whole population. This the government took no no tice of; but, on its being repeated, and the people becoming more clamorous against those of their generals whom they considered as traitors, these two heroes, in order to save the lives of the king and royal family, then in mo mentary jeopardy, nobly came forward and vol. n. D"], [50, "34 N A P L E S. declined the offer ; saying, that what they had done had been solely with a view to the public good, and that they looked for no reward be yond the heart-felt satisfaction of meriting the esteem of their countrymen. For this disin terested conduct they were universally applaud ed, and tranquillity was restored. Notwith standing this, on the king being reinstated by the Austrians, in his absolute power, he ordered those two honourable men to be tried by a mili tary commission of foreign officers ; which com mission condemned them to an ignominious death, and both of them were consequently hanged as traitors. Ferdinand's differences on political matters with the Crown Prince have long been the source of domestic feuds between them and his second son, Prince Leopold, the avowed favou rite ofthe old king ; and who, in consequence of his marriage with his niece, Maria Clemen tina, the daughter of the Emperor of Austria, has, with his father's consent, been carrying on intrigues at Naples, endeavouring to set aside the right of his elder brother, and to get himself declared heir to the crown in his stead. These are facts well known to many persons of the court, as well as to the nation ; and their plans would have succeeded, had not their abo-"], [51, "NAPLES. 35 minable intrigues been discovered ; as would also their attempts to have the Crown Prince car ried off, at different times, by poison, had it not been for the stir it occasioned amongst the people, by whom he is deservedly esteemed and beloved, for the liberal sentiments he entertains on all political matters. On the last disturb ance breaking out, he would certainly have been the first victim of popular fury, had the people not been convinced, from the way in which he was exposed to their rage, that he had been, equally with themselves, betrayed by his father and Prince Leopold ; though his filial and fra ternal affections prevented him from accusing either, and induced him, at the risk of his own life, to stand the brunt of every charge. All which conduct, however, has only still further established him in the love and esteem of the whole nation. The first false step of the Neapolitans may with justice be attributed to their allowing their newly-created constitutional king to absent him self from the seat of his government, and suffer ing him to be arraigned like a criminal, at the bar of a dictatorial self-created tribunal, consist ing of three absolute sovereigns ; to which humiliation he never would have consented, but d 2"], [52, "36 NAPLES. in the secret expectation of regaining that abso lute authority, to which he had been accus tomed from his infancy, and which he had con stantly exercised in his own right, or by proxy, for the space of nearly sixty years. It is there fore scarcely possible to imagine, that he could have been brought spontaneously to sanction the annihilation of his own power, but from dire necessity. Finding himself in a perilous situation, from a variety of circumstances, he joined his voice to that of the major part of his subjects, of all ranks, in favour of a free constitution, and yielded to the public will, through fear and not from choice. It was therefore naturally to be expected that, when out of danger, he would, from sheer pusillanimity, make his formal recan tation before this magnanimous tribunal of his acknowledged judges, and pay implicit obedi ence to its fiats, with as much ease and indiffer ence, as he had sworn to proclaim and defend the free constitution. Antecedently to the time of Charles the First of England, \u2014 who, at least, had some virtues, to redeem his want of good faith \u2014 the word of a king was looked upon as sacred, even to a pro verb : but, the glorious light of truth has dissi-"], [53, "37 NAPLES pated the ignorant enchantment, and has shewn them to be mere mortals, subject to all the weaknesses of frail human nature. The king's quitting Naples was alike the death-blow of the constitution and of his own popularity. From that moment he lost the pub lic confidence ; and he has been indebted ever since, for his personal safety, to the foreign troops of that very sovereign, to whom he had sacrificed the liberty of his subjects, and his own independence ; and for the commission of which crime he has been condemned, in his old age, to seek refuge in a barren northern clime, there to eke out the brief remainder of his mise rable existence. With what reason then could it be expected, when the head of the nation, as well as the par liament at Naples, had deserted the sacred cause which they had sworn to defend, that the newly raised corps of Lazzaroni would be more firm in their conduct, on the approach of their hun gry and mercenary invaders \u2014 that they would leave their homes and their darling maccaroni, for the chance of being butchered, in the cause osa set of constitutional poltroons, who had no one object in view but the safety of their own dear selves ? d3"], [54, "38 NAPLES. Ridiculous as some of these remarks may, primd facie, appear to those who are unacquaint ed with the character of these Lazzaroni, it is nevertheless a fact too notorious to be called in question, that one and all of them abandoned the cause which they had enthusiastically sworn to die for, or succeed in defending. It is even asserted, that on their being repulsed in their first engagement with the invaders, one of their own generals ordered them to retreat. Thousands, therefore, of these desperadoes were let loose on the country, with much less precaution, than a gentleman would bestow on discharging the meanest domestic. Like famished wolves, they prowled about in every direction, robbed every individual, and gutted every cot tage they passed. They laid hold of every thing that came in their way ; but cascia cavallo and maccaroni were the first objects of their plunder : these they carried off from the poor peasants by wholesale. The disbanding of troops in this way had, I believe, been never before resorted to by any civilized nation ; and is without a parallel in ancient or modern history. It has been said, that these disorders took place from the want of military magazines and regular com missaries. The fear of their returning to Na-"], [55, "39 N A P L E S. pies, and thereby chilling the ardour of the constitutionalists, has also been given out as one of the reasons for their being disbanded and let loose in the interior ofthe country. Errors of such magnitude as these are only to be excused, on the score of their having arisen out of an over-heated imagination, occa sioned by the victory they had obtained over the king, in getting him to consent to the esta blishment of a constitutional form of govern ment ; by which the liberty of the subject was to be dependent on the laws, and no longer on the caprice of absolute power. And certainly, on minds capable of appreciating the blessing, such a reform must have an astonishing influ ence, when fighting in the sacred cause of liberty, and emancipation from national slavery, under the yoke of a foreigner. Fatal as are the effects of retreat even to veteran troops, to an inexperienced, clamorous, newly-raised mob of Neapolitan Lazzaroni, little better than a horde of thieves, they must be irre trievably ruinous. It is said, that laurelled vic tory will make even cowards brave ; and it is equally certain, that brave men may become cowards for the want of it. A short time after his sister Caroline had d 4"], [56, "40 NAPLES. been married to the present King of Naples, Leopold, Grand Duke of Tuscany, paid him a visit, for the purpose of regulating some points connected with the Neapolitan government. In the course of the discussion, the King asked Leopold, how many Neapolitans he had in Tus cany ? The Grand Duke replied, that the question had no relevancy to the subject before them. \" Indeed but it has,\" retorted the King of Naples, \" for I have many thousands of your Tuscan subjects in my dominions ; and that is a pretty plain proof that they like my government better than they do their own ; for when people are happy, and possess the means of obtaining a subistence, they never quit their native land in quest of it.\" If Ferdinand should happen to recollect this anecdote \u2014 and I dare say he does, for monarchs are often found to possess the faculty of reten tion, even when they have no other \u2014 what must be his feelings at being now compelled, in his old age, to leave the delightful scenery and climate of Parthenope, to seek shelter in a bleak, chilling, northerly atmosphere, where, for two-thirds of the year, nature refuses to perform her accustomed functions !

The real cause of the misfortunes which have attended the Queen of Naples may be traced to her mother, the Empress Maria Theresa ; who, by her own example, taught all her daugh ters to govern their husbands : and in so doing she had in view the furtherance of her own political influence. Three of them she married to three weak-headed and feeble-minded princes. All of them were indulgent husbands and good fathers, but too careless and too bigotted for the times in which they reigned, to be consi dered good sovereigns ; and better calculated to adorn the domestic circle, or to be the inmates of a monastery, than to shine as statesmen or political princes. Caroline, therefore, became so excessively anxious to retain her power over the king her husband, that, from the fear of losing it, she was often betrayed into acts of violence, which were repugnant to her natural disposition and"], [59, "43 NAPLES. her cooler judgment ; for this princess really possessed a strong masculine understanding, with great natural and acquired powers of mind, scarcely inferior to those enjoyed by the pro soundest statesman. She had a cool head in council, was capable of forming a just concep tion of things in general, and had acquired a knowledge of men and manners, far exceeding that ofher unfortunate sister, Maria Antoinette of France ; who, though she had a greater por tion ofthe milk of human kindness in her com position than Caroline, possessed a capacity by no means capable of executing any plan that required firmness or perseverence. She never theless had a large share of natural good sense. From the fear of being supplanted, not in the affections of her husband, but in the exercise of her power, the Queen of Naples suspected every female to whom the king paid particular attention. Effectually to prevent such atten tions, she would instantly banish the object of her suspicions, not merely from the court, but from the kingdom. For instance \u2014 the last time that Madame Banti, the celebrated singer, performed at the theatre San Carlo, the very night which ter minated her engagement, she was hurried away from the stage to a carriage, and was not allowed"], [60, "44 NAPLES. to go to her lodgings, or even to take any repose, until she had passed the Neapolitan territory, from a fear lest the king should cause her engagement to be renewed. And all this from the motives of jealousy of which I have just spoken. The queen was the favourite sister of the Archduke Leopold, and Maria Antoinette of Joseph the Second of Austria. The latter was much offended with her, for condemning the precipitate manner in which he caused the monasteries and convents to be put down, throughout his dominions. In the body politic, there are certain disor ders which are more readily eradicated by par tial bleedings, than by the sudden application of violent remedies ; whereby there is great danger of not arriving at the desired object. For vices and virtues are the lights and shades of human nature. If all were virtue or all were vice, there would be a total blank in our com position. Cures prudently set about are gene rally attended with success ; for either they effect a radical change, or the patient dies a natural death, and gradually descends to obli vion : whereas, a too sudden shock never fails to leave behind it some lurking mischief. Thus it is with regard to monasteries and"], [61, "NAPLES. 45 convents. Wherever they have been suddenly and forcibly suppressed, they have repristinated with redoubled energy ; for we are naturally inclined to forget petty offences, but we never forgive acts of downright violence. Nothing can be more just than the punishment of mur derers : nevertheless, when we behold the cri minal at the place of execution, we forget the crime, and naturally let fall the tear of pity. As far as his heart was concerned, Joseph the Second was justified in suppressing the mo nasteries and convents ; but not so, as it regards his head : for Maria Theresa had already given orders, that all persons who had been forcibly secluded from the world, should, as soon as the fact was established, be absolved from their oaths, and restored to their families. Many abuses of this description had taken place in the course of her reign ; but, whether from neglect or the multiplicity of other politi cal matters, none of the applications in behalf of the persons aggrieved had been attended to. At her death, therefore, all these memorials came under the inspection of her son ; and some of them struck his mind so forcibly, that, without consideration or distinction, he directed all mo nasteries and convents throughout his domi nions to be put down : thereby imitating the"], [62, "46 NAPLES. approved precedent of the renowned Doctor Last; who, when under examination before the learned College of Physicians, previously to obtaining a diploma, on being asked how he treated his patients in certain cases? replied, \" I give them certain remedies that open both doors ; so that if the disorder does not walk out, it is no fault of mine.\" By so doing, Joseph undoubtedly made some few individuals happy ; but he was soon con vinced of the fatal consequences of the mea sure, when he beheld thousands of miserable objects, deprived thereby of their means of subsistence, becoming chargeable to the state ; and, like Ganganelli for having suppressed the Jesuits \u2014 (who, by the bye, have again started up in all the Catholic countries)\u2014 -Joseph was supposed to have paid for it with his life ; as Emperor and Pope are both declared to have been carried off by poison. So perfectly convinced was the Emperor Joseph of his error, that when Pope Pius the Sixth came to Vienna to expostulate with him on his conduct, he determined not to enter on the subject, and, during his stay of six weeks, never afforded his Holiness an opportunity of seeing him, except in public and on court days. Tired, therefore, of waiting, the venerable head"], [63, "NAPLES. 47 of the church took his departure for Rome, with the mortification of not having succeeded in the object of his long jousney. Joseph had adopted the principle of Catherine the Second ; namely, never to recede from what had once been decid ed upon, but to persevere in it, through thick and through thin, whether right or whether wrong. Ferdinand's principal minister and tutor was the celebrated Marquis Tenuci : but the pos session of talents, and the capacity of infusing those talents into the minds of others, and espe cially into the minds of absolute princes, are two distinct things ; to which are to be added, Ferdinand's aversion to study, and his exces sive love of amusements ; in which he was cor dially encouraged by the individuals who admi nistered the government during his minority. So that few opportunities were afforded the juve nile monarch of cultivating his intellects ; and, though the most active in the pursuit of amuse ments of all sorts, he was, from habit, the most idle and the most careless with regard to busi ness or mental improvement. Nay, on his mar riage with the Arch-Duchess Caroline of Austria, he scarcely knew how to sign his name ; and that princess was actually the first to teach him"], [64, "48 NAPLES. so to read and to write, as to make himself un derstood. Even after his marriage, so naturally averse was he to occupy himself with the cares of the state, that, at the instance of her mother, the Empress Maria Theresa, Queen Caroline took into her own hands the reins of government, excepting that portion of it which she bestowed on the Marquis Gallo. For so doing, the king being one day displeased with him said, \" Ah, Gallo, Gallo ; se non fosse per quella gal lina d' Austria,\" meaning the Queen, \" vi farei vedere chi sono.\" The Marquis's office soon after devolved on the notorious General Acton, the son of an English doctor, residing in the south of France \u2014 a circumstance which gave birth to the jeu de mot, \" H\u0153c rex, hie regina, hie h\u0153c et hoc Acton.\" That the witty insinua tion was fully justified by facts, will hereafter abundantly appear. As the king was one day hunting in a forest, on some of the crown lands, feeling in want of some refreshments, he entered a cottage belong ing to one of his tenants. After having regaled his royal stomach with a copious supply of bread, onions, maccaroni, cascia cavallo, and what not beside, Ferdinand, by way of return"], [65, "49 N A P I. E S. for the hospitable reception he had met with, renewed the man's lease, and directed him to repair to Naples, to see it carried through the necessary forms ; a duty which then belonged to General Acton's department. Sir William Hamilton and myself happened that day to be breakfasting with the great man. The moment his secretary saw the king's signa ture, he suffered the peasant to pass on to the sactum sanctorum. Upon looking at the in strument, so much did Acton, as secretary of state, feel his importance hurt, by this supposed infringement on his authority, in the king's signing a grant without having previously con sulted him, that he rose from his seat, and, in our presence, tore the paper into a thousand pieces, and flung it in the peasant's face. The poor man stood motionless for some minutes, until at last, recovering himself a little, he looked at us, and exclaimed, with tears in his eyes \u2014 \" Ahime, mama mia, son disperato ! vedete vostra eccellenza, vedete ; lo Re me l'ha fatto ; sottoserivetelo, fe me lo tu pure, per carita :\" \u2014 the king has made it ; for charity's sake, do you sign it also. Acton, out of all patience, taking up a cane, said to the poor fellow, \" If you don't quit the room instantly, I'll break every bone in your body.\" Upon VOL. II. E"], [66, "50 NAPLES. hearing this threat, the peasant, leaving the apartment, exclaimed, \" O ! mi son perduto ; e me ne va d'un re di bastone, a trovar il re di cuore : Addio ; statevene bene, re di bastone vero.\" In Catholic countries, and particularly in Italy, the people make only one meal on the day immediately preceding Christmas day ; and that meal generally takes place after sunset, and consists entirely of fish. I happened to be on a visit to Sir William Hamilton at Caserta, at this precise season of the year, and took oc casion to make some observations on the above conduct of Acton ; which had taken place only a few days before. I observed that, considering the great respect which was paid, in England, to any recommendation coming from the sove reign, I could not possibly conceive why so little regard should be paid to the orders of an absolute monarch, As soon as I had concluded my observation, Sir William answered me thus \u2014 \" To-morrow, Madam, will be Christmas-eve. To-day, the king is busily engaged in fishing, to supply the market of Naples with fish, for the suppers of his good Catholic subjects to-morrow ; when all the fish which the monarch catches himself, or causes to be caught in his name, he will him-"], [67, "51 NAPLES. self sell in the public market. If you are so dis posed, we will take a drive and see this regal fishmonger, like Solomon, in all his glory ! You will thereby, from ocular demonstration, be able to form your own judgment as to the real cha racter of this king, and of the claims which such a sovereign has to the respect of his sub jects, or of his ministers : though, with all his weaknesses, Ferdinand is allowed to be a good hearted man.\" I accepted the offer ; and accordingly, next morning, Sir William, Lady Hamilton, her mo ther, and myself set offfrom Caserta for Naples. Arrived there, Sir William and myself alighted, and, leaving the ladies in the carriage, we pro ceeded to the fish-market. And, sure enough, there stood his present majesty, the King of Naples, dressed in a white night-cap, and with an apron round his waist, selling his fish to the best bidder, surrounded, \" in all his glory,\" by the Lazzaroni, giggling, and eating bread and onions out of their filthy hands, and carrying on with them a conversation, couched in a sort of patois jargon, not a jot less vulgar nor more civilized than their own. A lawyer, whose name has escaped me, ap proached the stall, in the intention of purchasing some of the king's fish. Upon seeing him, his e 2"], [68, "52 NAPLES. majesty, who knew him to be a great miser, asked him considerably more for the fish than he would have done any other person. Upon which, the lawyer offered what he thought was a fair price ; when the king replied to him : \" Go, Mr. Lawyer, and fatten yourself on human dung ; for you shall have no fish at that price, I assure you.\" This was considered as an amazing piece of royal wit, and mightily was it applauded by the surrounding Lazzaroni, and loudly did these \" veritables sans-culottes\" laugh thereat ; for, to say the truth, the greater part of them were nearly in puris naturalibus, and exposed the entire of their filthy members, much more than those execrable wretches did, who first gave birth to the disgusting appella tion. His majesty used to indulge in numerous other amusements, equally singular and peculiar to himself. He would sometimes walk on the beautiful beach at the Chiaja, and, taking up one of these sans-culottes, would throw him, with the greatest violence, into the water \u2014 (per haps the only washing the fellow had ever re ceived) \u2014 and would then jump in after him, and bring him safe on shore. It was this freak of his Neapolitan majesty which gave birth to the im mortal Canova's two figures of Hercules flinging"], [69, "53 NAPLES. Lichon into the sea, now in the possession of the banker Turloni, at Rome. What, then, can rationally be expected from a nation which, for more than half a century, has been taught in such a school, and by such a preceptor ? On the last night of the Carnival, Ferdinand would go to the beautiful theatre San Carlo, and, ordering a dish of maccaroni to be brought him, scalding hot, and mixed up with oil, cheese, beef-gravy and what not, from one of the upper boxes, when the pit was crowded with spectators, all attentive to the opera or ballet, he would throw the greasy mess, by handfuls, on his loving subjects ; and those who wished to be particularly noticed by the monarch, would tumble head over heels, and scramble to pick up some of it to eat. All which the king would heartily enjoy, and would laugh most immoderately at those who appeared concerned and vexed at beholding the unctuous marks of royal favour on their holiday-suits. The queen, who would be sitting in her pri vate box, would generally retire from the front, and now and then peep out, as if she was un willing to shew herself until the kingly sport was all over. As soon as Ferdinand had en tirely got rid of the contents of his dish, he would enter her majesty's box, which was im- e 3"], [70, "54 NAPLES. mediately over the stage, and would there re ceive the most unbounded applauses for the feats he had achieved, and some ofthe Lazzaroni in the pit would hold up to him large pieces of the maccaroni ; upon which he would make the queen step forward to share in the public ap probation bestowed on these his princely amuse ments.

Queen Caroline was never very popular with the Neapolitans. She had been too well educat ed ; her mind had been too much cultivated ; and she discovered too great a contempt for the uncivilized people over whom she was destined"], [71, "55 N A P L E S. to reign, and could rarely descend to the vul garity and ignorance of the country. Indeed, she was too refined in her manners, and had too enlarged a capacity, for such a nation. Her judgment, on all matters pertaining to the state, was so correct, that her ministers could not fail to profit by the suggestions she would throw out. During the king's exile, the reign of usurpa tion at Naples was as vicious as it was detri mental to public spirit. The government was confined to the most circumscribed class of the old and new nobility ; and the people in general were precluded from taking a share in the public functions, except in subordinate military situa tions ; for those offices which were attached to the court service, and were of rank, etiquette, power, and effective authority, were solely en trusted to foreigners nominated by Buonaparte. Murat, like all the other kings who sprung from the Buonaparte manufactory, was merely an active agent, paying implicit obedience to his commands. None else could retain their situations ; for, if they chanced to be refractory and run restive, they were sure to be thrown out of the saddle of royalty. This government, therefore, was equally vicious, with regard to its organization, as the former had been ; the e 4"], [72, "56 NAPLES. entire executive administration being, as I have observed, confined to the class of the old and the new mushroom nobility, to the total exclu sion of the major part of the nation. To become a member thereof, the principal recommendation consisted in a readiness to sa crifice public virtue to absolute power. And thus were the rights and liberties of a whole people laid prostrate at the will of a circum scribed number of depraved and unprincipled individuals ! I will now relate a few interesting particulars, concerning Queen Caroline's exile, and her banishment from Palermo and the island of Sicily. On my arrival at Palermo, with a letter of recommendation for her majesty the Queen of Naples, which I had received from a mem ber of her imperial family, I was, to my utter astonishment, informed that she was then in close confinement, until such time as a ship could be got ready to convey her from the island. This was an order from the British comman der-in-chief, in consequence of his having dis covered a correspondence, in which the queen was directly accused of being concerned in a plot, which had for its object the betrayal of"], [73, "N A P L E S. 57 the island and of the British troops into the hands of the French. Previously to this accusation ; indeed, imme diately on her arrival at Palermo, with the king and royal family; her majesty had been deprived by the English, whom she considered as her allies, but not her masters, of that influence which she had been accustomed to exercise in the government of the country, and altogether excluded from the cabinet councils. For other political reasons of the English government at Palermo, the king, too, had been compelled to resign the government of Sicily into the hands of his eldest son, the crown prince. Still further to prevent the queen from having any influence in future, it was determined that she should be sent out of the island, and, ac cording to her majesty's own story, without having given the English the least reason for so acting, excepting that of continuing to go vern, as she ever had done before she came to the island. To prevent which, she sold, or pledged, every one of her jewels, retired to the mountains, raised a party of peasants with the money she had thus procured, and was re' solved therewith to recover her former situation of an independent queen, and not submit to be"], [74, "58 NAPLES. banished by a power which she had called in to protect her against the aggression and the violence, which she had experienced from usurpation in another quarter. I have been assured, that the mountainous situation chosen by her majesty as a place of retreat, had never before been inhabited, ex cept by a few straggling goats. Her forces consisted of about eight or nine hundred men, possessing no weapons of defence, except such as the implements used by them in husbandry would afford ; imitating, in this, the conduct of her immortal mother, Maria Theresa, when driven from her capital by Charles the Seventh, Elector of Bavaria, and flying to the Hunga rians for refuge. Lord William Bentinck soon found that no terms of conciliation would be accepted ; as her majesty declared, that the king's restora tion to power (which was tantamount to that of her own), and the total evacuation of the island of Sicily by the British troops, were the only terms to which, as an independent queen, she would listen. She respected, she said, the English, and considered them as allies ; but never could she be brought to acknowledge them as her masters. In consequence of this declaration, on the part of her majesty, all"], [75, "59 NAPLES. pacific measures were at an end ; and Lord William Bentinck immediately gave orders for the march of a sufficient number of troops, provided with camp equipage and cannon, who completely surrounded her place of refuge ; so that there was no alternative but surrender or starvation. This prompt step induced the queen to spare her followers the inevitable consequences of any momentary resistance, which either her own courage, or their attachment to her cause, might have produced. Her majesty was closely confined in a palace at a short distance from Palermo, and carefully watched by the British troops, to prevent the execution of any further schemes of mischief, with which she might have threatened the island, if suffered to be at liberty. In this condition Caroline continued, until such time as a vessel could be got ready, when she was shipped off to the Ionian Islands; from whence she went to Constantinople, and so on to Austria. In what I have here said, it is not my inten tion to accuse or to defend either party : I am only giving my reader a narrative of facts, to which I happened to be an eye-witness. But, I am free to confess, that, all circumstances considered, Lord William Bentinck, as com-"], [76, "60 NAPLES. mander^in-chief, charged with the safety of the island and also of the British troops, had no other alternative, but to act with that firmness which was most likely to insure the security of both. It was rumoured at Palermo, that previously to Queen Caroline's departure, Lord William recovered her jewels, and sent them to her majesty. Much may be said to exonerate her majesty from the foul charge of having treacherously betrayed either the island, or the British forces who were in it : for it can scarcely be con sidered an act of treason, in independent sove reigns, to endeavour, by any deed of heroism, to recover their lost rights, from those who may have usurped them illegally. The word \" betray\" is, in such cases, as much misapplied, as the word \" rabble\" is, when used towards a body of brave fellows defending themselves against the aggressions of a foreign invader. But argument is of no avail, where force and violence, and not reason or justice, reign paramount ! But, there is even a still stronger ground for exculpating her Neapolitan Majesty from the accusation of treason towards her subjects, her country, and her husband, and of ingrati tude towards the British nation for its active"], [77, "61 NAPLES. protection, which it seems to be difficult for those to imagine, who have not been living all their lives (as I may say) in a sink of vice. It has been my lot twice to have travelled over Eu rope ; and, after witnessing the brilliant glitter ings of all their courts, I can declare, with the utmost truth and solemnity, that by far the most virtuous inmates of those seats of general corruption, have been the sovereigns them selves. I know not whether their faults have been occasioned by the foul effluvia which they hourly inhale from the low and poisonous adu lation of those courtiers, who \" wear their faces to the bent of a king's looks,\" and who \" water their plants with the dews of flattery ;\" but this I will say, that few, very few indeed, are untainted with the infection of mean sub terfuge and hollow deceit : \" Princes, like beauties, from their youth, Are strangers to the voice of Truth. Learn to contemn all praise betimes, For Flattery is the nurse of crimes. Friendship by sweet reproof is shown ; (A virtue never near a throne !) In courts such freedom must offend : There none presume to be a friend !\" The above reflections are not those of a violent aristocrat, or of a vicious and base-minded de-"], [78, "62 NAPLES. mocrat ; but of an honest citizen of the world. Might not the queen's firmness have given umbrage to many of her enemies, from a fear, that if her majesty recovered her right of sovereignty, a just punishment awaited their crimes ? To prevent this, might they not have themselves fabricated all the foul projects attri buted to this most unfortunate queen ? That such things have been done we know but too well ! Witness the conduct of the infamous Madame de la Motte, in return for the well known humanity of that truly amiable, vir tuous, and ever-regretted victim, the Princess of Lamballe, (who interceded in her behalf with Marie Antoinette, and by which intercession the doors of her prison were opened, and the wretch escaped a life of misery to which she had been so justly doomed, as a punishment for her foul calumnies against both these her gene rous benefactors): for until then the public mind had remained untainted by the poisoned shafts which had been scattered in all directions against them. Is not this a fact ? Can it be contradicted ? And if so, might not another such a wretch have been found, who, thinking thereby to kill two birds with one stone, had formed the diabo lical design of accusing the queen of Naples, and"], [79, "63 NAPLES. of bringing down the odium of her party upon Lord William Bentinck for having exiled her ? and of thereby bringing about a revolution, having for its object the destruction of the English troops in Sicily ? \u2014 a project which, though crushed in the cradle, was certainly in agitation.

The Queen had been but a short time sent out ofthe island of Sicily, when, one morning, the king came unexpectedly to Palermo, and commanded a proclamation to be posted up all over the city, ordering Te Deum to be imme diately performed in all the churches for his"], [80, "64 NAPLES. convalescence, revoking his son's authority, and proclaiming his own resumption of the cares of government. This intention on the part of Ferdinand was announced so suddenly, and had been kept so entirely a secret, that nothing less than the promptitude which Lord William Bentinck had recourse to could have prevented its being realized. To prevent loss of time, the Duke of Orleans was instantly made the organ of the British commander-in-chief, to acquaint the king, that his palace at Palermo would forth with be surrounded by the self-same cannon that had sent the queen out of the island, and that he would himself be considered as a pri soner, and be made responsible for all the mis chief which this most imprudent and most un justifiable measure might occasion, if he did not instanter withdraw from the capital to the place from whence he came. Finding that Lord William was not a man to be trifled with, Ferdinand made a virtue of necessity, relinquished the joyful Te Deum, beat a retreat, and chaunted a requiem to his departed authority. His pusillanimity on this occasion lost him the affections of his Sicilian subjects ; as he afterwards lost those ofthe people of Naples, when it became known"], [81, "65 NAPLES. that he had sanctioned the murder of Carra cioli, of the famous physician Cerillo, of the two Piattis, father and son, and of divers other unfortunate individuals. Was not this a measure calculated to weaken, if not entirely, to overthrow, the British in fluence in Sicily, taken by the king himself? Assuredly, his majesty was more culpable than the unfortunate Caroline ; seeing that he had formally and solemnly renounced his authority. Nevertheless he, who had in good truth com mitted himself with respect to the English, was suffered to remain on the island ; because they were then convinced, that though the object was removed, the cause still existed ; and I have often heard many of the common people exclaim \u2014 \" Ebbene, quando saremo liberati di questi nostri ospitti, i signori Inglesi, chi hanno esiliato la nostra regina, poveretta ! e chi ten gono il nostro minchione di re nei ferri per \u25a0dominare loro ?\" The queen now became an object of com passion with the people of Sicily ; because they found her majesty had not been concerned in imposing on them a foreign yoke, to which they submitted with great reluctance. Like the Neapolitans, when she could no longer render them any assistance, they became sen- VOL. II. F"], [82, "66 NAPLES. sible of their loss ; and the influence of Lady Hamilton was, in consequence, very much weakened. However, to the kindness of the Queen of Naples, united to her own consummate ad dress, had Lady Hamilton been indebted for her good fortune. The following anecdote, which was related to me by her mother, ac companied with much mirth at the deception so ably played off, has been frequently con firmed by Lady Hamilton herself, as well as part of it by Sir William, and may be depended on as a fact. Miss Emma Codogan \u2014 for that was her name, at least the one which her re puted mother caused her to go by \u2014 when she first came to Naples, was sent by Sir William Hamilton, to be improved in her education, to a convent at Caserta. Walking out one day in the royal gardens, her personal charms attracted considerable notice. They became the subject of general conversation at court ; and, among numerous other dilettanti, they excited the cu riosity of a certain personage, who, as is usual on such occasions, employed some of his dra gomanni to inform him the very next time she made her appearance in the royal gardens. One day, when Emma was taking a walk as usual with the female who had the charge of"], [83, "67 NAPLES. her, she was accosted by the personage in question. He was so completely struck with her \u2014 for she was no less beautiful in form than she was engaging in manners \u2014 that he followed her and solicited a private interview, which was peremptorily refused. He, however, succeeded in gaining over the female belonging to the convent who attended her, to contrive to walk with her in a part of the gardens where they would be less observed ; and he there made her very seducing offers. But she refused to listen to any verbal promises, and requested he would commit to paper the proposition which he had, viva voce, made her. Not in the least suspecting her intentions, the personage in question complied. As soon, however, as Emma was in possession of the desired instrument, she sought an interview with the queen. The opportunity soon pre senting itself, Emma fell upon her knees before her majesty, and humbly implored her, with tears in her eyes, to condescend to hear what she had to communicate. To which the queen consenting, she assured her majesty, that she wished to seclude herself from the world, by taking the veil, provided Sir William Hamil ton did not intend to marry her ; by doing which she said she should escape the seducing f2"], [84, "68 NAPLES. temptations to which she was constantly ex posed. That the queen might judge of the sincerity of her declaration, she artfully pre sented her majesty with the paper given to her by the above-mentioned incognito; for such she represented him to be. At the sight of the document, which she instantly knew to be the king's hand-writing, her majesty was delighted at seeing so young and beautiful a creature so disinterested, and virtuously preferring a life of seclusion to the pleasures of becoming the mistress of a mo narch. Scarcely could Emma refrain from laughing outright, to think how completely she had imposed on her majesty, by making her believe that it was her intention to become a nun ; though the tears were at the moment trickling down her cheeks. Which said tears, however, as she has repeatedly told me, were occasioned by an onion which she had taken the precaution to conceal in her handkerchief, the better to enable her to carry on the farce. The queen had retired a few steps, for the purpose of reading the whole of the letter. \" During which time,\" said Lady Hamilton, \" I was on my marrow-bones in the garden.\" Her majesty then came up to her, and com manding her to rise, assured her, that if Sir"], [85, "NAPLES. 69 William Hamilton did not engage to make her his wife, within the space of four and twenty hours, she would provide for her a retreat in a convent, according to her wishes. Taking then a valuable ring from her finger, her ma jesty presented it to the fair supplicant, in re turn for the confidence she had so disinterest edly reposed in her ; and on reaching the palace, she sent immediately for Sir William Hamilton. As might be expected, the result was an im plicit compliance with the wishes of a suppli cating queen, in behalf of his amorosa. It is very probable, that Sir William only wanted a stimulus of this kind, to justify him in putting into execution an act which he had long medi tated, and which he was only deterred from doing, from the fear of forfeiting the high favour which he enjoyed at court, and with it his situation, as well as a dread of the ridicule to which he should be subjected, from the dis parity between the parties, both in point of birth and of years. But, having thus obtained the royal sanction, he got the better of every other scruple ; and, sending for Miss Emma, informed her, in the presence of the queen, that she was now the wife of his choice, and should, without loss of time, be made so by F 3"], [86, "70 NAPLES. law. At this sudden and unexpected piece of good fortune the young lady fainted with joy, and was not relieved until a \" sea of copious pearls, which some call tears,\" came to her assistance. From that moment, however, Lady Hamil ton, in consequence of her beauty, her talents, and her good conduct, enjoyed the esteem of every one who was acquainted with her, and became the confidential companion of the Queen of Naples ; and even the old ruffiana, as the king used to call the mother of Lady Hamilton, was frequently sent for to make tea for her majesty at the palace. The unfortunate arrival of Admiral Nelson at Naples occasioned a total change in the con duct of Lady Hamilton ; and, in consequence of which change, she lost all her former in fluence and popularity. I left Palermo about the same period at which the queen had been sent off to the Ionian Islands. The last time I had the honour of being presented to her was when her majesty was at Zante. On being ushered into the royal presence, I offered, as usual, to kiss her ma jesty's hand; which, like those of her unfor tunate sister, Marie- Antoinette, was remarkably handsome. Upon seeing my intention, her"], [87, "NAPLES. 71 majesty withdrew it, and said \u2014 \" No, the cere mony would now be a mockery of royalty, and an insult to my present condition. The daugh ter of Maria Theresa \u2014 a wanderer, an outcast \u2014 must no longer receive those marks of dis tinction, which were the prerogatives of the Queen of Naples. You behold me now in a very different situation to that in which you first saw me, when you presented me with the letters of my dear murdered sister.\" At this remark, observing me to be much affected, she continued \u2014 \" Do not imagine I mean to offend you. I know your respectful attentions are directed to my person ; for cer tainly they cannot be interested at this mo ment, as I am no longer in a situation to reward you as such attention merits ; but when I reflect, that the only foreign nation for which I had a sincere regard has thus insulted me, and, what is still worse, ruined me in the esteem of many of my friends, by calumniating me in the eyes of all Europe, I cannot help feeling a pleasure at the sight of one of that nation who, I am sure, will do me justice.\" I said, it was no more than my duty, in grateful return for the former bounties I had received from her majesty ; nay more, it would be an homage paid to her virtues and her fortitude. F 4"], [88, "72 NAPLES. \" I thank you,\" continued she ; \" I do not class you among your haughty upstart English, who now govern Sicily. No : I know how to dis tinguish. Sir William Hamilton had been nearly thirty years at Naples. I looked upon him as one of my own family. He was the confidential friend of the king my husband, and all my children loved him. He saw them born. But Lord William Bentinck has been grossly imposed upon : if not, he has insulted me from private motives. I never gave him the least cause for so acting. He lent ready cre dence to every thing that was told him by my enemies. But, it is beneath the dignity of a queen to subject herself to foreign inter ference.\" I said, I always considered Lord William Bentinck to be a most respectable and honour able character, and that probably her majesty had been imposed upon. \" Imposed upon !\" she replied, \" imposed upon ! I have been de prived of the government of my own country \u2014 of the dignity of my character \u2014 of the affec tions of my husband and children ! But he has never been a father \u2014 he has never been a sovereign \u2014 and cannot therefore have the feel ings of insulted majesty. And then, I am ac cused of treason, because, forsooth, I wish to"], [89, "73 NAPLES. recover my just rights, as an independent sove reign, a wife, and a mother !\" I said, I hoped her majesty would, ere long, enjoy them again. \" Never,\" she replied, \" never. I shall be one of the few queens who end their days in the place that gave them birth. I pardon Lord William, as I do the rest of my enemies ; but not only England, all Europe will one day do me justice.\" I said, I was convinced that her great mind, like that of her immortal mother, would be respected and duly appreciated by posterity. Her majesty next asked me very kindly where I was going? I told her, that as soon as the blockade should be raised, I intended to set off for Venice ; which place was not more than forty-four posts, or eighty-nine German miles, from Vienna. \" Oh,\" said she, \" as you know the miles and posts so well, I conclude you have often been there : to-morrow I am going from hence to Turkey.\" I said, that as soon as I arrived at Venice, I would do myself the honour of inquiring after her majesty's safe arrival, of my friend the Princess Colalto. \" Oh, you know the family of Colalto ? Then I shall see you again.\" I said, that if her majesty would allow me that honour, I should"], [90, "74 NAPLES. consider it as the greatest possible mark of her majesty's distinguished bounty. Giving me her hand, which I was now permitted to kiss\u2014 \" There,\" said she, \"you have it. I shall always be glad to see one who was so earnestly recom mended to me by my beloved sister. I sup pose you are truly English, and not afraid of the sea.\" I said, no ; but that I held with the Italians, when circumstances permitted. \" What is that ?\" I told her majesty they said, \" Lode il mare, ma tiente alia terra.\" \u2014 \" Ah,\" said she, \" if ever that should be the policy of England, she will be ruined ; if she be not so already, by her too large standing armies, to the neglect and detriment of her navy.\" I said, I left that matter to those who go verned ; as I did not understand the system of politics at present pursued. \" That shews good sense,\" said her majesty, ff for nobody I believe understands them. From the way in which certain affairs are conducted, it would appear as if their rulers were paid for the ruin, and not the prosperity, of certain countries.\" I said, I hoped her majesty did not think thus of the English ministers. \" I don't know,\" replied she, shrugging up her shoulders: \" they are mere men, like others, and must be blind to"], [91, "NAPLES. 75 their own interest, otherwise they would never keep up such standing armies.\" I was extremely happy to see her majesty so calm, and considered myself much honoured by so long a conversation. I therefore encou raged it, for fear of a relapse, and observed, that Sicily, from its situation and commerce, might, I thought, be enabled to keep up a respectable navy. \" Yes,\" replied her majesty, \" if the Sicilians were like the Enghsh, and contributed towards the expense ; but all our\" \u2014 Here she immediately corrected herself, say ing \u2014 \" all the Sicilian barons are feudal prin ces, and though sufficiently rich, will not even pay the common taxes, much less contribute towards defraying the expense of a navy. In former times, that good old Sir William Hamil ton, when the war broke out with France, was very desirous that the king, my husband, should establish a naval force, upon the footing of yours in England ; but General Acton insisted, that the King of Naples was too poor to sup port the expense. The times, however, are changed ; and the French, ever since they have had Naples, have made the people pay ten times the taxes they formerly did.\" I then wished her majesty health, and a safe arrival at the place of her destination. She"], [92, "76 NAPLES. graciously wished me the same at Venice, and affectionately reminded me of my promise to visit her at Vienna. CHAPTER VII.

Though her majesty, the Queen of Naples, in the course of the long conversation which I have detailed in the preceding chapter, often delivered herself with much energy, she never for a moment forgot, that she was the daughter of the great Maria Theresa. Her dignified deportment, whilst addressing herself to me without the least restraint, proved her to be every inch a queen ; and I have often been assured by the Duchess Carigliana Marini, who followed her majesty to Sicily when she left Naples, that the only motive she had for cultivating the acquaintance of Lady Hamilton and her mother was, that they were her spies"], [93, "77 N APLB S. Upon the king's private amours, and upon the motions of that portion of the nobles who were disaffected towards her authority ; and who, to maintain their influence, stirred up great mis chief at Naples, involving the ruin of the queen and that of many other families. I forgot to mention in its proper place, that in the course of the preceding conversation, her majesty introduced the name of Salicetti, saying, in Italian, \" Anche quel birbante ha creduto di prendermi in trapola : what could I expect from a villain, who had been the fac totum of the whole revolutionary tribe, and who was then one of the most active satellites of Bo noparte and of Murat at Naples ? But, I will say no more : the wretch was beneath my notice. Yet, I am accused by Lord WilUam of having carried on a correspondence with Murat, the object of which correspondence was to betray the English ! After seeing our most faithful servants and friends torn from the king, and myself insulted, what would he have done, had he been in my situation ? God forgive him ! I never had reason to regret my knowledge of any other British subject. Lord William has been strongly prejudiced against me. How ever, it will soon be out of the power of my"], [94, "78 NAPLES. enemies to do me any injury, or further to mortify my amour propre.\" These observations were delivered with that stoic firmness which is seldom the companion of a guilty mind. Grand and dignified in her demeanour \u2014 of a disposition liberal and muni ficent \u2014 noble of stature, and the mother of a numerous and healthy family \u2014 Caroline of Naples, though a fallen sovereign, was still powerful over her own wounded feelings, be cause endowed with real fortitude and genuine virtue. I had first the honour of being introduced to her Sicilian Majesty in the year 1791, when I was intrusted with letters to her from her sister, Marie- Antoinette, the Queen of France ; by whose gracious recommendation I was often charged with verbal messages, of a nature too delicate to be committed to paper in those perilous times, when the most trifling miscon struction might have occasioned the death of the innocent bearer of them. In the year 1793, in the fatal month of Oc tober, in which that injured queen was so bar barously murdered at Paris by the revolu tionary cannibals, I went to Florence ; but, being in a very indifferent state of health, I was per-"], [95, "NAPLES. 79 suaded by Lord Hervey, Mr. Udney, and many other friends, to try the effect of a change of air, since they were aware that my illness had been occasioned by my being overwhelmed with grief, for the losses I had sustained on the fatal tenth of August, and the barbarity exercised on the third of September towards my most liberal benefactress. The recommen dation was followed ; and, in company with two foreign ladies, I set off for Naples. Sir William and Lady Hamilton having been ap prized of my intention, and feeling much in terested in my welfare, kindly came to meet their former friend some miles on the road to Naples ; but, no sooner did I see that they were both in deep mourning, than I was at once convinced that the Queen of France was, alas, no more ! Sir William Hamilton was the only person admitted to the presence of the Queen of Naples, while the mock trial of her martyred sister was going on at Paris. On Sir William's announcing my arrival, amongst other persons who had come to Naples to pay their respect ful homage of condolence for her majesty's grievous affliction, he received her imme diate command to present me exclusively to her."], [96, "80 NAPLES. On entering the royal apartment, and be holding her majesty, who bore so strong a resemblance to her murdered sister, I fell speechless into the arms of Sir William ; when the Queen of Naples exclaimed, with a tre mendous shriek, \" Good God ! did you ever think the French would have treated my dear sister and her husband in so horrible a way ?\" This scene, though heart-rending, was pro pitious, as it afforded me time to recover. I was, in a feeble voice, about to address her majesty in French, when she instantly said, \" for God's sake, do not, I beseech you, let me hear any of that murderous language ! You speak German and Italian ; pray address me, for the future, in either of those languages.\" However, her majesty soon relapsed, and con tinued the conversation in French, which seemed her habitual language. I saw her majesty again in the year 1795, and might also have seen her when she was at Palermo ; but, ' from the situation the country was likely soon to be in, and she being then under a certain surveillance, I was told by high authority, that it would be most prudent in me not to visit her majesty, nor send the letter I had brought with me: which was merely a letter of recommendation from one of the Im-"], [97, "81 NAPLES. perial Family, for the purpose of refreshing her memory. For which, however, there was no necessity ; for though many years had elapsed, the moment my name was made known to her majesty at Zante, she instantly recollected it, and began to unburthen her mind to me in the manner I have already related. And even then she recalled to my remembrance the most re markable events ofthe French Revolution which so cruelly interested her ; particularly those of the tenth of August and third of September 1792, and the fourteenth of October 1793; the last of which always brought torrents of tears into her eyes, which never failed to be followed by a volley of execrations against the whole French nation. This, I think, ought, in no small degree, to exonerate her majesty from the suspicion of partiality to a nation, which she always con sidered as the cause of the ruin and overthrow7 of so many members of her august family, and by which she herself had been driven to seek refuge under the military protection of ano ther nation, which now rewarded her confi dence with banishment. The school of adver sity may tend to soften down the violence of passion, but it can never change or destroy the workings of nature. VOL. 11. o"], [98, "82 NAPLES. Shortly after his marriage with Caroline of Austria, the King of Naples was one day walk ing out with his youthful bride at Caserta. On their way, they were accosted by a peasant, whose wife- had blessed him with three thump ing boys at a birth. The poor fellow observed, that he should have been more pleased if they had been three calves. \" And how did you manage the matter,\" said the king, \" for I have been married for some time and have not had a child yet?\" \" Please your majesty,\" replied the man, \" the jade deceived me ; for I have only been married three months, and therefore two-thirds of the business must have been done before hand.\" \" O, then,\" said the king, \" in that case you only come in for a third of the merit !\" \" Yes,\" continued f,he clown, \" that is true ; but I should neverthe less like to find out to whom the other two belong, for I am very poor, and dame is so ill, that she has lost her milk and cannot suckle the brats.\" \" Well, here's something to buy a cow with, and I hope she will turn out more profit able to you than your wife has done.\" \" Bless your majesty, there's no such luck among the brute creation ; for no other animal is so prolific as a woman !\""], [99, "83 NAPLES. The queen laughed heartily at this dialogue between a king and a clown. However, though her majesty was not of the Neapolitan breed, which is considered the most fruitful in all Italy, she nevertheless verified the\" peasant's remark, and, in the course of a few years, became the mother of twelve or fourteen fine children. The Neapolitans are robust, well made, above the middle stature, and rarely deformed or de fective in their features. The females have little to recommend them but their eyes, and are very much inclined per far I'amore. In general, they are sallow complexioned, much given to indolence, badly educated, uncouth in their manners, but enthusiastically attached to their own country : \" Ve di Napoli, e poi mori,\" is their standing proverb. The common conversation of the Neapoli tans is generally so noisy and so boisterous, that a stranger would naturally suppose they were on the point of murdering one another. Their gesticulation is very significant ; but they are the most laconic nation on earth. In affairs of business they will impose upon you if they can. Even the most respectable shop keepers will ask you three times more for an article than it is worth ; and on being told of g 2"], [100, "84 NAPLES. it, they will rarely let the article be re-shewn : they generally answer you in monosyllables, and, after taking the goods from the counter, will say, \" vatene, va.\" When asked to direct a stranger to any par ticular spot, they stare him full in the face, and lift up their heads towards the sky ; which is as much as to say, \" I don't know.\" Or if they happen to like your countenance, after taking a survey of it, they will answer you roughly, \" chi saggio .-\"' A lady who was about to pay a morning visit to a friend, knocked at an apartment on the ground floor, where she thought she lived : on opening it, the servant lifted up his head and shut the door in her face. Supposing that her friend lived above, she as cended a story higher, where she met with the same reception. Upon this, concluding that her friend, who was osa studious turn of mind, had taken an upper floor, to avoid the terrible rattle of the strada Toledo, she continued her pursuit, until she had reached the uppermost apartment, where she was again answered by the same inclination of the head, and the same chi saggio ? I may here observe, that it is quite common, in various parts of Italy, for persons of the first rank to live in the upper stories of their man-"], [101, "85 NAPLES. sions, in preference to the lower, particularly at Genoa and Venice, where they give sumptuous entertainments in them to their firiends and relatives. There is little or no difference in the man ners of the lazzaroni of Naples and the an cient nobility ; except such of them as have travelled. Intelligence and classical know ledge is alone to be met with in the middling ranks of society ; yet they boast of many lite rary men, whose works have immortalized their names, and stood the test of ages. The Nea politans are, however, by nature, classically musical. In the beginning of the French revolution, Saint Januarius, who was the patron of Naples, being accused of the crime of Jacobinism, his statue was brought into open court, tried, found guilty, condemned to lose all its valuable orna ments, to be thrown into prison, and Januarius to be deprived of his protectorship; which was transferred to Saint Anthony. 'In such extra vagant veneration had the worthy Januarius, their old patron, once been held, that the ignorant people would implore our Saviour to solicit that saint to be propitious to them-ima gining the latter to have more influence than the former ! g3"], [102, "86 NAPLES. At Naples were formerly to be found a larger number of a certain class of mutilated beings, of which I have spoken in my first volume, than in any. other city of Italy. These poor devils are sensible of their degraded condition, and generally give out, that it has being owing to accident. In general, however, they are the offspring of the lowest class of the human spe cies, who sacrifice their children to the vilest speculation. Hundreds of them have been thus shamefully unsexed in their infancy, who never possessed a voice ; as the operation would be of too dangerous a nature at a more ad vanced stage of their existence. It is no less true than extraordinary, that if the excision takes place during bad weather, the victims never sing in tune. This is certainly very curious ! When they happen to have no voices, they are either taught to play on some instru ment, or are otherwise employed in menial situations, as they are totally ignorant of every thing but music ; for the moment they are docked for singing, they are sent to the conser vatoires. Scarcely a soul of them can read. Pacchierotti was one of the best informed of the race of castrati. In consequence of his having a large portion of natural good sense, he greatly improved himself by study.

I have frequently been in company with Paisiello and the famous Monk, il padre Gior dano, at Sir William Hamilton's. This Monk had a remarkably fine bass voice, and though an eminent preacher, would often accompany Lady Hamilton in comic and double entendre duets, catches, and glees, in which Paisiello and Mrs. Billington would join. In consequence of meeting the above Monk so much in society, I remember the King of Naples once saying, that he was the best preacher, the best singer, and the best eater of maccaroni in his whole dominions. He was a very stout man, above six feet high, well proportioned, and had a good-looking, cheerful countenance. His long, white, monastic dress, contrasted with that of the rest of the com pany, had the most singular effect possible ; considering that monastic characters in general ought to be dead to worldly pleasures, and alive only to the edification and improvement of others. Father Giordano was not, however, to be classed among his dead brethren ; for he really lived, and enjoyed the good things of this g 4"], [104, "88 NAPLES. world like other men, and was, to all intents and purposes, what may be called a bon vivant. Paisiello having completed a new oratorio, at the first representation of which the king, the queen, and all the court were present, the composer came to conduct Lady Hamilton and myself to the church, which was very much crowded. As dilettanti, we were placed by the composer in a situation the best calculated for us to appreciate its merits. It was really a good composition. It was certainly not in the sublime style of the immortal Handel's sacred music ; nevertheless, had it been as well exe cuted as the music ofthe latter generally is in England, the effect would have been very dif ferent. On this occasion, there happened to be no fewer than a hundred of those \" noun adjectives of the neuter gender,\" of which I have been speaking, employed in the cho russes ; and, so abominably did they sing out of tune, that poor Paisiello, forgetting where he was, jumped from his seat in a passion, and exclaimed, \" Ah ! managgio dei morti, siete stati tutti castrati in cativo tempo !\" alluding to the fact I have already noticed ; namely, that these degraded beings never sing in tune, when the maiming operation has taken place in bad weather. The effect can be better imagined than"], [105, "89 NAPLES. described : the church resounded with the laughter of the whole congregation ; and thus ended the poor \" enraged musician's\" oratorio ! Though Paisiello, as well as his brother com poser Cimarosa, had all the manners of the lazzaroni, he nevertheless would not have so far forgotten the respect due to the sacred place in which he then was, had he not been entirely led away by his mortified feelings. Cimarosa and Paisiello were sworn enemies. They were never seen in company with each other. It was impossible to be on friendly terms with the one, if you happened to applaud the works of the other. These two great men in their line, would even go to the theatre in disguise, to hiss each other's compositions. But Cimarosa was superior to Paisiello. Gene really speaking, one opera ofthe former compo ser would have made a dozen operas of the lat ter. They were, however, much esteemed at Naples ; and deservedly considered \u2014 Arcades ambo ; Et cantare pares, et respondere parati.\" Skilful Arcadians both, and both inspir'd To sing, and answer as the song requir'd.\""], [106, "90 CHAPTER VIII.

The Roman code of laws at present in use \u2014 for that of the immortal Justinian has long been banished the country for which it was intended \u2014 is founded on caprice, and is one, in the execution of which justice is sacrificed to power. In point of theory, the prohibition of litigation between brother and brother, ap pears well calculated to preserve harmony be tween two beings springing from the same pa rent stock : but, how far it may be beneficial in practice, I leave to the gentlemen wearing black robes and big powdered wigs to decide ;"], [108, "92 ROME and shall only observe, that if such a law exist ed in England, bread would be considerably cheaper; as much of the flour which is now wasted on wig blocks, would find its way into the bellies of the half-starved and the hungry.

The members forming the tribunals at Rome, if tribunals they can be designated, are called Auditors. Those who fill the office of Audi- tors of the sacred Rota have peculiar privileges over the rest of the Auditors ; who, though they sit as judges, are, from their numerous acts of cruelty and injustice, more criminal than the malefactors who are executed before the debtors' door of Newgate. Their mode of pro- ceeding in all civil cases, both as judge and as jury (for both characters are united in one and the same person), is this : whenever a creditor who happens to be a stranger, makes his appeal against a Roman subject, to avoid entering into"], [109, "93 R O M E. the merits of the case, the applicant is put off whenever he seeks justice, with the cant word of proservato ; and a decision is never come to, one way or the other ; it being their policy to retain foreigners as long as possible at Rome, whereby the city derives a benefit, which it would not do were the judges to come to a prompt decision. Thus do the cases remain in their primitive state, in secula seculorum ; which is even worse than what we see in an English Court of Chancery ; for there it is not impossi ble, that the third or fourth generation may come triumphantly out of court with the family deeds \u2014 though the property shall long ago have been entirely swallowed up by the legal expenses ! Thanks, however,\" to the senatorial exertions of Mr. John Williams, the vigorous little bantam-cock of the British bar, that most grievous of nuisances, the \"law's delay,\" stands a fair chance of being speedily \" abated.\" I wish I could say the same thing of \" The insolence of office, and the spurns, Which patient merit of the unworthy takes.\" Though the Roman States have suffered much in their legitimate population from the effects of external celibacy, in consequence of which two thirds ofthe land is uncultivated, and even the"], [110, "94 ROME one-third which is cultivated is generally per formed by peasants coming from Tuscany or the northern states of Italy, the devil is never theless as busily employed in this holy city, as ever he was in the garden of Eden; and, in the article of \"forbidden fruit\" he has been, and now is, carrying on as brisk a trade, as in any other part of the known world. For there is no class of men who have more nephews and nieces than the Roman clergy, and especially the Cardinals. Having no children whom they dare to own, they differ from all other men, in living after death, by the adoption of those of other people. Since the unnatural Council of Trent, no ecclesiastic is suffered to have a child of his own : he al ways contrives, however, to have some good natured brothers or cousins, who are ready to father them. The natives of Rome partake generally of the spirit and character peculiar to its soil, whenever it is cultivated. They are the best improvisatori and satirists in all Europe. The genuine Roman masculine character is more faithfully depicted in the class called the Tras teverini, than it is in those who reside on this side the Tiber. Though the violence of in quisitorial superstition may have tended to"], [111, "ROME 95 debilitate their manly character, and to disin cline them to warlike exertions, it has never been able to subdue their independent spirit, or entirely to repress their mental energies. When a paper currency was about to be in troduced into the Roman States, a certain indi dual at Rome published some very judicious remarks, pointing out the drawback it would occasion to commercial speculations, and the evils which it had already inflicted in France, in Germany, and in Spain. To obviate which evils, he intimated, that it would be necessary, as a previous step, that the government should declare the precise quantity it intended to put into circulation, which should be secured to the holder on lands legally mortgaged for the liquidation of the sums necessary to replace the said paper ; by which means it would always be at par with the precious metals. At this just proposition the government took the alarm, fearing that the publication might tend to impede the operation of the measure ; as it was also suggested, that in the mortgage given to the national creditor should be speci fied, whether it was to be repaid in revenue, in landed property, or in specie. A reward of six thousand crowns was offered for the dis covery of the person or persons who had thus"], [112, "96 ROME dared to prejudice the operations of govern ment. On the following morning, the statue of Marforio was wittily made to ask the statue of Pasquin, \" whether the reward was to be paid in paper or in specie ?\" Nor did the go vernment ever discover the author of the pam phlet, or of the pasquinade. Perhaps I ought to tell my reader, that the statue of Marforio is a statue of Mars, found in the forum, which the people have corrupted into Marforio. The statue of Pasquin is a mar ble statue, greatly mutilated, which stands at the corner of the palace of the Ursini. It takes its name from a cobbler of that city, called Pasquin, famous for his sneers and gibes, and who diverted himself by passing his jokes on all that went through that street. After his death, as they were digging up the pave ment before his door, they found in the earth the statue of an ancient gladiator, well cut, but maimed and half spoiled : this they set up in the place where it was found, and, by common consent, named it Pasquin.

The grandeur of their buildings, the magnifi cence of their churches, daily presenting them selves to the eyes ofthe inhabitants, have justly made them the envy of every civilized nation. The immortal Canova, when at Vienna, and in the zenith of his celebrity, courted and feted by all that was distinguished for birth, for rank, and for talent, being one day at Prince Rezzonico's, was asked, why he appeared so low-spirited ? \" I do not know,\" .vJd he, \" what is the reason ; but, when I am in my studio at Rome, working all day long with my paper cap on my head and my apron round my waist, I feel my lungs expand, my heart at ease, my spirits light as air, and my vigour increased by contemplating the surrounding objects.

How just is the sentiment of Sallust ! \" Concordia res parv\u00e6 crescunt, discordia maxim\u00e6 dilabuntur.\" Would to Heaven, that the several nations of Italy had in time read, learned, and in- wardly digested Fontaine's delightful fable, beginning, Toute puissance est foible, a moins que d'etre unie !\" The people of Ferrara, Urbino, Ancona, and Bologna, as well as the Trasteverini, have long evinced an ardent love of liberty and in dependence ; and, if seconded in their efforts h 2"], [116, "100 ROME by a generous nation, may one day effect the desired emancipation of all Italy. If the name of the ancient mistress of the world was ever dear to the lovers of science and the fine arts, they must feel deeply for the present degenerate, effeminate, and degraded condition of this once seat and centre of all that is noble and sublime. What an immense debt of gratitude do the people of Europe owe to those wonderful works which abound in every part of this truly classical country ; which few have succeeded in equalling, and none in surpassing ; and which have had such a decided influence on the taste of all other nations! Though in no city can improvement be so effectually obtained as at Rome, yet the mo tive which once animated, and inspired, and called into action, the genius of her own chil dren, alas, lies crushed and buried under the dark superstition of narrow-minded ecclesias tical dominion !

Whenever any one of the understrappers of his holiness the Pope happens to become a favourite with the people, he is generally ap pointed Governor of Rome ; that being a sure step to the dignity ofthe Cardinalate. During the time that Pius the Seventh was at Paris, engaged in the holy office of anointing Buonaparte and his wife Josephine, and crown ing them Emperor and Empress of France, the Governor of Rome was a person named Caval chini ; but, from his ignorance and vulgarity"], [119, "R o m e. 103 the appellation of Cavallaccio would have bet ter suited him. This same Cavalchini could never be spoken with after dinner; so, in order to save trou ble, he would generally, like the worthy Hiber nian, breakfast over night ; for this disgusting creature, from the copious libations which he paid to Bacchus \u2014 the only debts, by the bye, he ever troubled himself about paying \u2014 would sometimes continue in the holy state of com fortable intoxication for eight and forty hours together, and sometimes longer ; pursuits of this kii?d being better suited to his reverend governorship than the dry routine of public business. Previously to the mighty Napoleon making his infant son and heir king of Rome, the streets of that city were never suffered to be lighted up. To prevent the people from running foul of each other, or against the carriages of the car dinals, every one provided himself with a dark lantern, similar to those which are made use of by house-breakers in this country ; which lan terns they would poke into people's faces, aud thereby prevent them from seeing their way. This state of darkness, in which it was the policy of the Roman government to keep its subjects, was resorted to, upon the principle, h 4"], [120, "104 ROM B that it was as well for the people to be kept ignorant of certain cardinal practices ; which would become too manifest and glaring, if the streets were suffered to be lighted up. For the self-same reason the holy conclave have a private door to all the theatres in Rome, through which they enter en masque, and every now and then, par hasard, stumble in the dark, upon some pretty female or two ; whom, out of pure christian charity, of course, they take under tbe shelter of their sacred wings, during Carnival time ; the better to prepare the said pretty females for their Lent confessions ! All these aforesaid matters are carried on at Rome, in a mightily edifying, pious, and inno cent sort of way, and purely for the good of the souls of the parties concerned ! as may naturally be expected, from men who are living under so sober a governor, and whose long cloaks so philanthropically cover what the witty Sheridan, in his admirable opera of the Duenna, calls \" provision for the convent.\" Nay, such a sympathetic feeling \u2014 so vast a spirit of christian charity \u2014 presides in its pristine vi gour in the breasts of these celibatarii, that the moment a free trader happens to arrive in the holy city, the fact is made known from one end of it to the other ; and, if the frail fair one"], [121, "105 ROME should not be inclined to accommodate the whole college of cardinals, it is hinted to her, that she must forthwith shift her quarters, and carry on her carnal concerns elsewhere. The greater part of the Roman nobility scarcely ever give wages to their domestics. Indeed, it was customary formerly for servants to allow their masters a certain sum, out ofthe money they extorted from those foreigners, who merely visited Rome, for the sake of viewing the chef-d' \u0153uvres of the fine arts, in the pos session of the nobility. Prince Spada is the proprietor of what is said to be the original statue of Pompey the Great, at whose base the mighty C\u00e6sar was so cruelly murdered.

It is not uncommon for them to tell foreigners point blank, that they live upon what they can collect from strangers, as their masters allow them no stated salary. Indeed, their own excellent proverb contains the best definition of this degraded race \u2014 \" Roma santa, e popolo corrotto ;\" and, as long as this fine portion of Italy shall continue under the trammels of an ecclesiastical government, it never can recover itself, so far as to be on a level with the other civilized nations of Italy ; and still less will its people aim at an imitation of the dignity, the valour, the virtue, and the greatness of their renowned forefathers. From her primitive ecclesiastical institutions, Rome has naturally been deprived of those things, which are allowed to form the best riches of every other country \u2014 population, agri culture, and commerce. Solely as head of the Church, and as the sovereign representative of St. Peter, surely the Pope might be to the full as much respected as he now is. \" My kingdom is not of this world,\" was the lan-"], [123, "107 R 0 M E, guage of our Saviour. God forbid that I should wish to deprive his holiness of his just prerogatives ! I cannot, however, help think ing, that if he were to confine himself solely to spiritual concerns, it would be much to the advantage of the Christian world; and that his presence would become the foot of the altar, infinitely better than it does the arena of political warfare. The restoration of the holy father to tempo ral power, has certainly been owing more to English policy, than to the exertions of all the catholic princes of Europe ; as those princes, both individually and in a body, voted against it. Nay, the Emperor of Austria, when the late Pope was elected at Venice, would not, but for the influence of Napoleon, have con sented to his returning to Rome to take pos session of the Sacred See. But the holy father was at that time one of the innumerable gew gaws with which the great Buonaparte amused himself, and the people he governed ; and, hav ing so powerfully seconded him in his projects, the newly-made emperor insisted on his pope ship being allowed to leave Venice. On which account, when he reached Rome, he acquired the nickname of Papa-Gallo. To such a pitch did the crafty Corsican hoax the holy man, that"], [124, "108 ROME he made him believe he was a staunch Catholic. But, though he acknowledged the Pope's su premacy, as head of the church, he insisted on his being allowed to go to Rome, merely for the purpose of humbling the pride of Austria, and to make the old pope himself subservient to his future views of aggrandize ment : for he was well aware, that it was much easier to subdue the ecclesiastical autho rity, than it would be that of any other prince, whom Austria, or the allied powers, might be inclined to set up in his stead ; feeling perfectly persuaded, that they did not intend to unite it to the kingdom of Naples. England also, from political motives, the more effectually to baffle the powers of the continent, became the strenuous advocate for the re-integration of the papal authority : at the very moment, too, when throughout the British dominions, all relaxation in favour of her own catholic subjects was denied to them ; though no crime could be charged against them \u2014 unless it be one to adhere faithfully to the religion of one's forefathers !

While the pope was absent on his famous visit at Paris, it was held, by Cavalchini, the governor of Rome, to be tantamount to high treason for any one to suspect, insinuate, or even imagine, that his holiness would return to his capital empty handed. The restitution of the Roman legations which had been taken from Pius the Sixth at the peace of Tolentino, was looked upon as the intended reward of his ready compliance. To secure this restitution, the pope fancied himself justified in acceding to the humiliating journey, which Buonaparte compelled him to undertake, as well as to the still more disgraceful task of officiating at his coronation at Paris. There can be no doubt whatever, that Buonaparte had held out similar allurements, and that they had been confirmed to the Pope by Melzi, Duke of Lodi, as well as by General Miolis. However, when he had succeeded in getting the Roman \" actors,\" as he called them, to figure away on the French stage, and had there exposed and turned into ridicule the whole Roman catholic hierarchy, Napoleon thought no more of his promises. Though it must be confessed, that the appearance at Paris of his"], [126, "110 ROME holiness, added much to the solemnity of the ceremony, and gave real weight to the asser tion, that Buonaparte had been called to the imperial diadem of France by the free will of the people ; yet, as head of the catholic church, it cannot be denied, that the pope, by his pre sence, sacrilegiously sanctioned the exclusion ofthe crown from the head of its then existing ligitimate wearer, in order to place it on that of an unprincipled usurper. This imprudent as well as unjust act, in the face of all Europe, on the part of the power that ought to have been the most opposed to its execution, furnished Napoleon with the arms wherewith he had predetermined speedily to subdue the pope and the whole ecclesiastical domination, by lessening and degrading the very foundation of the religious order. And this he certainly effected, by being Macchia velist enough to cause himself to be crowned at Paris by the sacred pontiff: this being the only instance of the kind in the history of the christian church ; for even Charlemagne, who, in the year 800, had surrendered the Roman states in perpetuity to the ecclesiastical au thority, had condescended to repair to Rome, for the purpose of being crowned. What an amazing improvement has the lapse of a thou-"], [127, "111 ROME sand years effected in the manners and senti ments of mighty conquerors ! As soon as the farce of the coronation was over, his holiness the pope, accompanied by his pontifical suite, paid a visit to the Tuille ries, to congratulate his Imperial Majesty on the event, and took occasion to jog the me mory of the mighty man, as to the promise he had entered into, with regard to the restitution ofthe Roman legations. Upon this the \"po tentissimo ed augustissimo imperatore,\" \u2014 for such were the titles which he had modestly taken to himself \u2014 flew into one of his violent passions, \u2014 exclaimed, with his brother monarch, the renowned Arthur, We were indeed a pretty king of clouts, Were we to truckle to her maudlin humours ;\" and ordered the hoary-headed manager, to gether with his troop of puppets, to quit the capital of his empire, without loss of time \u2014 but not before he had made the old man feel the weight of his imperial fist !

The rumour of the entire failure of the pope's application to the Great Napoleon reached Rome long before the actors them selves arrrived there. It excited various and different sensations ; and gave birth to innu merable lampoons, and amongst others to the following : \" Instead of his holiness returning to us, bringing with him an engagement for the restitution of the lost Roman states, it will be fortunate if the Emperor does not deprive the pope of those which the church is still in possession of; considering the rapacity of the one party, and the christian meekness of the other.\""], [129, "113 ROME This innocent pasquinade coming to the ears of the drunken sot, Cavalchini, the governor of Rome, he threatened to send every man who should dare to allude to the circumstance, to the castle of St. Angelo.

Certain it is, that Napoleon and the Pope parted in mutual disgust and dudgeon with each other : so much so, indeed, that the for mer would not allow his holiness to crown him King of Italy. The promise respecting the restitution of the legations was a mere pre tence for getting the Pope to Paris ; and, as it was never intended to be performed, it was as good as any other : to have answered the ob ject of the moment, Buonaparte would not merely have promised the legations, but all France itself: his language resembled that of the renowned Macheath \u2014 \" What signifies a promise to a female !\" When he had no further occasion for Pius the Seventh, it is clear that he regarded him in the light of an old woman : and therefore was it necessary that the good man should be disgraced, as an VOL. 11.

Another thing that gave mortal offence to the newly-made Emperor was, that his holi ness was daily becoming more and more popu lar at Paris ; a circumstance this, which was of itself a deadly sin in the eyes of the master of Europe. The bare idea that any earthly being should share in his popularity, was as a dagger to his heart. The Parisians, too, even began to be religious : they anxiously attend ed his h oliness's benedictions ; they applauded him in public, more loudly than they did their new monarch : and these were mortal crimes not easily* to be forgiven. The refusal to fulfil his promise, by restoring the provinces taken from Pius the Sixth at Tolentino, compelled his holiness to quit Paris and the new im perial court ; after remonstrating against the shameful treatment he had received at the hands of Napoleon, and solemnly protesting against the violence that had been offered to his sacred person. Every thing between his holiness the Pope and the Emperor Napoleon remained in statu quo, until his last invasion of Austria ; upon which occasion, the principal condition on which"], [131, "115 ROME he consented to withdraw his troops from Vienna, was a contract for a young wife, before he had fairly got rid of an old one. Having entered into this stipulation with the sovereign of Austria, the father of Maria Louisa, Napoleon next insisted, that his intended daddy-in-law should henceforward go by the name of Fran cis the First. \" Necessitas non habet legem :\" as drowning men are said to catch at straws, the Emperor, for the sake of saving himself, sacrificed his beloved daughter, and assumed the proffered title. To satisfy his sensual inclination, Napoleon, like Henry the Eighth of England, applied for the sdlva condotta to his holiness the Pope ; and, as Henry thought it would not be more difficult to obtain a divorce than it had been to assume the title of Defender of the Faith ; so was Napoleon equally credulous in believing, that the consent to a divorce could be as easily obtained from the Pope, as the consent to a coronation had been. The title of \" defender of the faith\" had been bestowed on Henry by Leo the Tenth, for the support which the Eng lish monarch had given to the Catholic reli gion ; but the divorce was applied for to Cle ment the Seventh, the new pope, who was then the prisoner of Charles the Fifth, a near rela- i2"], [132, "116 ROME tive to Catherine of Arragon ; who, from po litical motives, as well as on principles of re ligion, refused his compliance. As Napoleon had not only violently insulted the head ofthe church, but had trampled religion under his feet, the Pope had every reason to be dissatisfied with his conduct ; and feeling him self, besides, under no obligation to the Em peror of Austria, he was induced by no mo tives of policy to act in contradiction to the dictates of his own conscience ; for he had re- married Buonaparte to Josephine at the ex press desire of the husband ; as previously they had only been bound together by a civil contract, during the reign of democratic principles, and had not submitted to the ecclesiastical cere mony, by which Catholic marriages can never be dissolved, except on proof that they did not take place according to the precise forms enjoined by that religion. This, however, could not be the case in the instance before us, as the ceremony, which had taken place only a few years before, was not one between minors, or between individuals living under the controul of parental violence, but between two persons arrived at the full age of maturity, and following their own sponta neous inclinations."], [133, "117 ROME Even if his holiness had been living on the best terms with Napoleon, obstacles here present ed themselves, which could not be got rid of, except in the case of an hereditary legitimate line, where a succession was necessary ; as in the instance of Henry the Fourth of France, who repudiated Ann of Valois, and married Catherine of Medicis. But Buonaparte had long before this publicly declared the first-born son of his brother Louis to be his heir ; and, previously to that, the son of Josephine, prince Eugene Beauharnois. All these obstacles were, however, mere trifles with a man like Buonaparte, who had made up his mind further to ennoble himself by an Austrian alliance : that alliance which proved so fatal to himself, to France, and to all Europe ! for in wedding Maria Louisa, he united himself to his malora ; and, in propor tion as his grandeur increased, so did his popu larity decline. By this single act, the strings of his good fortune were snapped asunder. He now shone, in the constellation of royalty, like one of those minor planets which revolve round the sun, and borrow their light from the great orb of day. Every mean insult was now resorted to, whereby the authority of the Pope could be i 3"], [134, "118 ROME, in any way undermined ; and, assassin like, the poisonous shafts were aimed at his holiness in the dark. His subjects were encouraged and incited to rebellion, by promises of reward ; and his sacred authority was spurned at and disregarded. To all which the good man, saint like, submitted, with a degree of resig nation only to be looked for in truly Christian minds. His territories were violated ; his go vernment was overthrown ; and he himself was made a prisoner in his own capital. In this state of suffering, Napoleon naturally expected, on the part of Pius the Seventh, either complaint or compliance. But, neither one nor the other could he extort from the calm and philosophical ministers of his holiness. Outrageous at this unexpected forbearance, Napoleon directed Miolis, who then command ed the French forces at Rome, to arrest the Pope, in the Quirinal palace, and to send him forthwith a prisoner to France. Miolis, who was an ex-friar, had hitherto shewn the greatest outward marks of respect towards the person of his holiness. The Pope, however, forseeing, from the violent measures that had been adopt ed, that Napoleon would not be satisfied, until such an event had taken place, had determined to shut himself up in his palace, and to exclude"], [135, "119 ROME himself from visitors, of all descriptions, except ing his own trustworthy ministers. Upon this, Miolis made frequent remon strances to Cardinal Consalvi, at his being thus deprived of all intercourse with his holiness ; and, receiving the uniform answer, that the Pope would be seen by no one, he, \" in the dead waste and middle of the night\" \u2014 an hour propitious to deeds of treachery \u2014 taking with him a body of soldiers, scaled the walls of the Quirinal palace, entered the garden like a thief, broke open the door of the chamber in which his holiness was sleeping, arrested him, and sent him off, that very night, like a common malefactor, with scarcely any one to attend him, or any supply of the things neces sary to his personal use and comfort. So se cretly was the affair conducted, and so little was it then expected to be executed, that nearly all the conclave were absent at their country residences ; and it was not known in Rome, until late on the following day, that their sovereign had been kidnapped and carried off to France. The better to prevent discovery, Miolis had caused relays of horses to be placed at dif ferent stations, at a distance from the high road, by which his scandalous treachery re- i 4"], [136, "120 ROME mained undiscovered. This atrocious cir cumstance calls to my recollection the arrest of the whole royal family of Spain, at the period when Buonaparte offered himself as a mediator between the king and his son the Crown Prince, whom he had encouraged to re volt and to dethrone his father. When they were in his power, with the rest of the royal princes, and the queen with her cher ami, the Prince of Peace, he made them sign an abdica tion in favour of his brother Joseph, and sent both father, mother, son, and paramour close prisoners to France. He then separated the prince Don Antonio, brother to the king, and the princes from their father, placing one part of the family under the responsibility of the newly-made prince Talleyrand, who was their goaler, and sending the other part to Italy, there to repent at leisure of the folly they had all committed, in trusting to the promises, and putting themselves in the power, of such an unprincipled man as Buonaparte. The particulars of this transaction were re lated to me by the late queen of Spain, whilst she was at Venice : \" My husband, \" added she, \" never abdicated : he allowed my son to take the reins of government, to quell the dis turbances that had broken out in Madrid, and"], [137, "121 ROME and he partially resigned, to prevent the effu sion of blood ; but he was afterwards forced, by Buonaparte's violent conduct and threats, not only to abdicate, but to renounce the suc cession of his children to the throne of Spain. In consequence of my remonstrances with him on this breach of good faith, by which he had become perjured, he would allow neither me nor my husband to reside in France ; and the pensions which he promised us, were scarcely ever paid. On our arrival at Marseilles, I parted with some of my jewels, to defray our travelling expences. \" Her majesty further told me, what I thought rather singular, that she had got very little for her jewels, as they were found not to be of the first water. Her majesty was at Venice at the time when the Princess of Wales visited that city.

In point of civilization, the Tuscans are infinitely beyond the rest of the terra firma Italians, and are at the very least a century before hand with the Neapolitans. The Sicilians have gained much, in this respect, from their commercial intercourse with Tuscany ; but the higher classes of society in the island of Sicily are, in point of elegant manners and classical attainments, far behind the people of Florence. The Etruscans appear, by nature, to partake very much of the mildness of their serene and salubrious atmosphere. Their modest simpli city ; their truly elegant manners ; and, above all, the insinuating suavity of the fair and beau-"], [142, "126 TUSCAN Y. tiful part of the creation, united to the purity of their language, all bespeak them to have been a perfect resemblance of the primitive inhabi tants of the garden of Eden \u2014 \" Grace is in all their steps, heav'n in their eye : In every gesture dignity and love. \" But, alas, since the fatal period of the French revolution, they have been, in no small degree, corrupted by the all-powerful and all-seducing thirst for an imitation of exotic manners, as well as exotic vices, to the exclusion of that native simplicity which is the prime ornament of woman ! The prolificacy of the Tuscan soil, if I may be allowed the expression, is as much occasion ed by the judicious manner in which it is cul tivated, as it is by the mildness of its climate, and the purity of its sky. Not an inch of earth is left idle. Vines, olives, all kinds of fruits, are planted one above the other, in geometrical symmetry ; rising progressively, until they lose themselves in the clouds, and forming, in the vintage season, one of the most enchanting scenes, that nature can pos sibly produce. The common people, as well as the peasantry, speak the language, as settled by the cele brated academy Delia Crusca established at"], [143, "127 TUSCANY. Florence, in its greatest purity ; and even the beggars in the streets, who ask you for a crazia, which is almost the smallest coin of the country, really do it con grazia, and will often address themselves to a stranger in the classical idiom of their poets, and tell you, that such and such a nobleman has regaled them, on their birth-day, with \" an omelet of four eggs\" \u2014 which, indeed, is by no means a common event ; for the Tuscans are neither rich nor generous, and do not reckon their income by pounds, shillings, and pence, but by the number of flasks of oil or of wine, which is made on their estates. Nay, many of the nobility, both at Florence and at their country residences, will sell you, at their own houses, a single bottle of either. At the side of the door of their palaces, there is usually a little hatch, just big enough to admit a bottle, and a bell ; on the ringing of which, and paying the price, a servant brings the wine or the oil to the purchaser. The Tuscans never impose on foreigners, in the manner practised at Naples and at Genoa. The shop-keepers are remarkably honest, as well as civil ; and particularly so to the English. At Florence, there are three or four very good theatres ; but they are open for per-"], [144, "128 TUSCANY. formances only at a certain season of the year. A good opera is rarely to be met with at Flo rence, except when the principal singers hap pen not to be engaged elsewhere ; as the peo ple are really too poor to pay them sufficiently high salaries ; except during the bathing season at Pisa and Lucca, at which towns there is a great influx of strangers ; and even then the natives are admitted at half-price. At Florence there are numerous private amusements at the houses of the nobility, where concerts are given to strangers in excellent style, as well as other fashionable establish ments. In former times, the principal families who gave the above weekly conversazioni, were the Duchess Strozzi, the Marchese Santine, Torreggiani, Acciauoli, Corsini, Ruspigliosi, &c. ; besides which, there was the noble public Casino. The Palazzo Pitti, the public garden of Boboli, which commands a most beautiful prospect, the garden of exotics, the gallery of natural history, and the gallery of pictures and of statues \u2014 a full description of which will be found in every itinerary \u2014 are all chef d '\u0153uvres of science and of taste. The streets of Florence are all well paved, well lighted up at night, and kept, like the churches and houses, remarkably clean. The"], [145, "129 TUSCANY. people of Tuscany are generally very frugal and sober. The Tuscan women are considered well made, and as having fine figures and fair complexions. They dress tolerably well, and are remarkably dignified in their deportment ; but those of Siena are not only proverbially beauti ful, but amiable in their manners ; and their conversation is infinitely more acceptable to a delicate ear, as they speak the Italian language without the harsh guttural aspiration of the Florentines. Arezzo, the birth-place of Mec\u00e6nas and of Petrarch, and anciently called Aretium, is a town of some consideration, situated at the brow of a fertile mountain. Its inhabitants were the only people who made any thing like a resistance to the French invaders. When any of the sans-culotte gentry paid them a visit, they were rarely suffered to return to tell tales ; for they put to death every man that had the rash ness to venture amongst them. In character they resemble the Romans more than they do the Tuscans : in shape and make, they are rather stouter and taller than the latter, and infinitely more marked in their features. In general, the men of Tuscany, both. in size and figure, are like the English ; and they are not unlike them in manners, excepting that they vol. n. K"], [146, "130 TUSCANY. are more communicative, and more pleasant and agreeable in society ; not quite so rude as to shove people off the pavement, as is not un frequently the case in London ; nor quite so uncivil as to sit with their arms a-kimbo, at the theatres and other public places, in the presence of ladies ; and, like the men of every civilized nation, they are \u2014 for the truth will out ! \u2014 more attentive to the fair sex, than are my worthy countrymen, Messieurs les Anglois. The guttural pronunciation, so peculiar to the Florentines, and so widely different from that of the other states of Italy, is supposed to have arisen from the long residence amongst them of their gothic invaders, in consequence of the extraordinary beauty and fertility of the country. And, no wonder ! \u2014 \" For wheresoe'erl turn my ravish 'd eyes Gay gilded scenes and shining prospects rise, Here the sweet muse so oft her harp has strung, That not a mountain rears its head unsung ; Renown'd in verse each shady thicket grows, And every stream in heavenly numbers flows.\" The Tuscans are easily governed, and hold the memory of the late Grand Duke Leopold, the predecessor of the reigning duke, in great reverence. But, if Ferdinand does not inherit Leopold's abilities, he, at least, possesses the"], [147, "131 TUSCANY. milder virtues. In general, the people are attached to his person ; as they are indeed to all his family, considering them as Italians, born and reared up, for the greater part, in Tuscany. They rejoiced at his restoration, but complain bitterly of the influence of the House of Austria ; though the mass of the people were by no means warmly attached to the French. In her rule over the Tuscans, Eliza Bacciochi closely followed the tyrannical footsteps of her brother Napoleon. Various rumours of a scan dalous nature are in circulation respecting the connection between her and young Lucche sini. The insolent and haughty means re sorted to by her, for the purpose of humiliating the ancient nobility of Tuscany, afforded them frequent opportunities of discovering their sen timents respecting her, by often refusing to pay court to her ; indeed, in 1814, on her depar ture from Tuscany, they shewed towards her fhe most unequivocal marks of their dislike. The Austrians, who succeeded the French in the temporary possession of Tuscany, did not, however, succeed in conciliating the affec tions of the people. The Florentines were overjoyed at getting rid of them ; although it is said, that their Grand Duke paid several k 2"], [148, "132 TUSCANY. millions to the Court of Vienna, by way of compensation. The fact is \u2014 deny it who can ! \u2014 that the Austrians have disgusted the entire people of Italy, by their uncivilized behaviour, their rudeness of manners, their disgusting pride, and the easy indifference with which they appro priate to themselves the goods and chattels of the natives of the countries which they over run, not as deliverers, but as conquerors.

Anecdote qf a certain English noble lady Reflections on Murat' s fall. Lucca, the industrious, one of the most ancient, and once one of the most happy re publics, fell beneath the hand of a foreign rapacious invader. In Lucca there was no inquisition \u2014 no arbitrary despotism \u2014 no over-"], [149, "133 LUCCA bearing, bigotted, ecclesiastical authority \u2014 no Venetian oligarchy, so much railed at by the despoiler of Italy ! Nevertheless, Lucca, like the rest of that delightful and magnificent country, has fallen a sacrifice to the bound less ambition of a universal dictator ! Peace and plenty, riches and happiness, were the blessings enjoyed, and enjoyed silently for ages, by this happy little republic. The character of its natives is mild, mode rate, frugal, industrious. The soil, the climate, and the language, resemble, in every respect, those of its polished neighbours ; as the natives also do both in their manners and customs. By Buonaparte this little republic was trans mogrified into a dukedom, under the name of Lucca Piombino, to admininister to the am bition of Eliza Bacciochi, the eldest and the favoured sister of the Corsican, who took upon herself the title of Grand Duchess of the same ; though she could only be considered as a subor dinate agent to the grand carver of European destinies. When the nobility of Lucca were first pre sented to Bacciochi, their harmless blockhead osa grand duke, who had not long before been a marker at a billiard-table, they apologized to their newly-made sovereign for their ignorance k 3"], [150, "134 LUCCA of court etiquette, observing, that they never before had had the honour of having a grand duke ; to whom Bacciochi replied with a laugh, \" Never mind, gentlemen : we'll excuse each other : for I am as great a novice in my new situation, as any of you can possibly be in yours.\" His christian name was Pascal, which in Italy is an appellation not held in the highest vene ration, since it is synonimous with that of dunce. Accordingly, on his being appointed the foot-stool prince of Lucca, Buonaparte, who looked upon every member of his imperial and royal family as being nothing more than subordinate agents, gave directions to Bacciochi to take upon himself the dignified name of Felix the First ; a circumstance which gave rise to the following jeu d'esprit \u2014 \" Quando tu eri Pasquali, noi eravamo tutti felici : or, che tu sei Felice, noi siam tutti Pasquali.\" Bacciochi was a harmless, insignificant bon vivant. His wife, on the contrary, was so im pudently ostentatious, that she was generally disliked. When she paid a visit to Venice, she took up her residence in the palace Cor naro, on the grand canal, called the Palazzo della Ca Grande. Marina Cornaro, the Pisani of San Steffano, one of the most distinguished of"], [151, "LUCCA 135 the patricians, as well as one of the most virtu ous, amiable, and charitable ladies in all Venice, waited upon this mushroom duchess, to enquire if her highness was comfortably lodged and accommodated ; but though in her own palace, and defraying the expenses of its table, she was not suffered to sit down in the presence of her parvenue of a visitor. Lucca is at present under the authority of Maria Louisa, a sister of the \" beloved \" Fer dinand of Spain, and widow of Louis, one of the brood of kings whom Buonaparte made and unmade. She was one of his first queens of Etruria, created at the moderate price of eight millions of livres, which he received from her father, Charles the Fourth of Spain ; though her husband had been by him deprived of the dukedom of Parma, his hereditary dominions. After the death of her short-lived king and husband, she was intended, by Buonaparte, to be the second wife of his brother Lucien ; but, not being inclined to follow the example of Napoleon, in divorcing one wife in order to make room for another, the match did not take place ; which circumstance is supposed to have given birth to the quarrel between them. Had he but remained firm in his resistance to the ambitious views of his brother, to the end ofthe K 4"], [152, "136 LUCCA farce of king-making, Lucien would have im mortalized himself as much for his moderation, as his brother Napoleon has been \" damned to everlasting fame,\" for his unlimited and insatiable ambition. Un fortunately, however, the alacrity with which he stepped forward to assist his brother to re mount the throne which he had solemnly re nounced his right to, proves but too clearly, that if Napoleon, at the former period, had con sented to have crowned Lucien's obscure wife, he would, like the rest of his brothers, have accepted the poor and humble pittance of a kingdom. The reconciliation of the one bro ther, and the unexpected activity of the other, is pretty clearly accounted for in a letter which was intercepted, and by which it evidently appears, that Napoleon had a new kingdom in petto, for this long neglected sprig of the imperial Corsican tree. His refining pot was once more to have been put into the furnace, for the purpose of melting down into oblivion the recollection of the porter's daughter, and to bronze her over with the varnish of majesty; and, there is little doubt, that the Princess of Canino would have cut as good a figure on the imperial stage, as the rest of the"], [153, "LUCCA 137 Buonaparte-breed of actors nnd actresses have done. Besides the above eight millions of livres paid to Napoleon, Lucien had received a con siderable sum in the way of brokerage, for being the mediator in this affair, as well as for having been the ostensible person commis sioned by the Queen of Spain and the prince of peace, to negociate the preliminaries of peace between France and Spain. He there fore un-duchessed her to make her a queen, and afterwards un-queened her to make a duchess of his imperial sister, Bacciochi! While the present duchess of Lucca was the mock-queen of Etruria, and, vice versd, Eliza Bac ciochi was Duchess of Lucca Piombino (which latter title belonged to the noble family of the Lovisis, the Prince of Piombini, then living at Rome) the assumed democracy of the real princess, and the aristocratical preten sions of the democratical princess, occasioned them to live in tolerably good fellowship with each other, and especially in all matters in which they could assist and further the policy of their mutual patron and master ; the neces sity they were under of doing which is the best excuse that can be found for the conduct they pursued. As the satellites which revolved"], [154, "138 LU C C A round the Napoleon orb, were one and all compelled to dance to his music, and to sing too, whenever he commanded them \u2014 for with the mighty man it was \" No song no supper,\" \u2014 both of them paid a visit to Leghorn, and when there went on board a merchant ship from Malta, under the pretence of interrogating the captain, respecting the route which Mrs. Spen cer Smith had taken, after she had escaped from the officer who had arrested her at Brescia. But this was a mere pretence. The lady they were really in quest of was one who had been arrested at the same time with Mrs. Spencer Smith, while she was at Venice on a visit to her sister, the Countess of Attemis, and who had also fled from her gaolers in a small fishing boat, and traversed the Adriatic, until she had fallen in with the British fleet, which was then blockading the Venetian ports ; and who was taken up by one of Admiral Fremantle's ships, and carried triumphantly to Malta. What the illustrious ladies wanted, was to get possession of the captain's journal, for the purpose of finding out the route she had pursued, that they might give intelligence to the French police to have her arrested, in case it found out where she resided. But the lady was"], [155, "139 LUCCA fortunately safe at Palermo. The two im perial and royal agents were consequently obliged to return to their respective steward ships as they came, re insecta \u2014 and greatly mor tified at the miscarriage of their honourable, most honourable, commission ! For the flight, and safe arrival of Mrs. Spencer Smith at Vienna, had been announced in all the public papers. It was effected through the assistance of a Neapolitan gentleman, who followed her from Venice to Brescia, taking with him a male dis guise, in which she equipped herself, and, in stead of going to rest, by the means of a lad der which the gentleman procured, and placed at the first floor window of the inn in which she was to pass the night, she made her escape ; and the next morning, when the officer came to her bed-room door to call her up, with the intention of proceeding on their march, the bird was flown, and already in Switzerland ; having taken the route of the Lago Maggiore \u2014 as she afterwards informed me herself, when I met her at Vienna. On these occasions, the French were not very gallant ; for they would make the ladies walk nearly as if they were prisoners of war, or, what is worse, common soldiers. This was the case"], [156, "140 LUCCA with poor Mrs. Watson, an elderly lady, the wife of the last British Consul at Venice. When the French first entered this city, her husband having been sent, by Sir Richard Wors ley, with dispatches to England, they took her prisoner, and dragged her about, from one place to another, for the space of nearly eight years. In consequence of this ill-treatment, and her being often obliged to lay down her weary limbs on the high roads, she returned to Venice, on the downfall of her cruel op pressor, a complete cripple, totally deprived of the use of her limbs, from her hips down wards; and there she remained until death kindly put an end to her sufferings ! The truth was, that Napoleon's police were so ashamed of having been outwitted by a couple of ladies, that they exerted every means to get them again within their power; but, finding they could not obtain their wicked ends, they became so outrageouly exasperated, that they arrested all the English travellers they could find in Italy. The Countess At temis, however, the sister to Mrs. Spencer Smith, became afterwards the dame d'atour of the ex-queen of Naples, who is now the wife of Marshal Macdonald."], [157, "LUCCA 141 When the present Grand Duchess of Lucca was dethroned by Buonaparte, she was ordered by him to repair with her son to Milan, there to await his further instructions, as to their future destination. It is said that Murat, the then governor of Lombardy, moved to com passion by her distressed situation, paid her the most marked attentions ; which were not lost on the widowed queen. But this so roused the jealousy of the great lady his wife, that she contrived to have her removed from the scene of danger, least the growing attachment should become reciprocal \u2014 as it is well known that Spanish ladies are not entirely insensible to the attractions of handsome French officers. She was, therefore, soon sent off to her future des tination in Spain. It is also said, that she was extremely jealous of a German princess, who resided some time at Naples, previously to her going to Egypt ; but, it was not so easy a matter to persuade king Murat to send this lady away from Naples, as it had been to send away the Queen of Etru ria from Milan. Sound policy prevented such a step ; for this lady happened to stand high in the estimation of a part of the British na tion ; and, founding great hopes on her popu larity and foreseeing the result of the Isle of"], [158, "142 LUCCA Elba affair, the influence of that lady was looked up to as a source of protection in the hour of danger. A certain noble lady, as distinguished for her personal charms as she has been for her prolific qualities, and who was once the cher amie of a distinguished member of the English opposition, contrived to strengthen the hopes and expectations of this puff-paste king ; but, his elevation being built on a rotten foundation, all was of no avail, and the whole fabric fell to the ground ; the principal actor having been shot as a criminal, merely because it was more convenient and expeditious to put him out of existence in that manner, than by hang ing him up by the neck. What a useful lesson does the melancholy end of this mushroom branch of the Napoleon dynasty, who had been originally a postillion, and afterwards a scullion in the Prince of Conde's kitchen at Chantilly, present to the reflecting mind !

The inhabitants of Modena and Parma may be considered as completely sunk into the lethargy of indifference, with regard to the future political destiny of their respective duchies. But, such is the natural consequence of gross superstition, and the arbitrary and vexatious power of an oppressive government ! Too long have they been subjected to the tooth less controul of old women and of a wily priest hood, and much do they stand in need of being roused from that state of feeble infancy to mature manhood, before they shall be fitted for the enjoyment of rational liberty and inde pendence. But, what can be looked for from"], [160, "144 PARMA AND MODENA. them, so long as they shall continue to be kept in such an abject state of slavery, that isa sub ject, in passing by the carriage of one of their princes or princesses \u2014 even though it were an infant at the breast of its nurse\u2014 were to omit to take off his hat, he would be instantly ar rested, and thrown, like a common felon, de graded and dishonoured, into a dungeon, with out a hearing before judge or jury ; and, if he should dare to remonstrate, and enquire on what account he has been thus treated, he would be insolently told, that \" that would be known by the punishment.\" The dignity of our social existence impe riously demands, that we should soar above the level of the brute creation ; but that can only be done through the free agency of our faculties ; for when the exercise of those faculties is ille gally impeded, instead of soaring above, we sink infinitely beneath them. Man, being con stantly at variance with his fellow, is the only ani mal that counteracts nature ; a fact this, which is demonstrated by the violence to which a human being resorts, the moment he attains the mastery over that power, by whose over bearing oppressions his energies have been borne down and repressed. The truth of this has been fatally evinced by all modern revolu-"], [161, "PARMA AND MODENA. 145 tionists ; and it will continue to be so, until a just equipoise shall be established between the governors and the governed. Although, therefore, the recent movements in Italy, and particularly in Naples and Pied mont, have, for the moment, been unsuccess ful, it is highly improbable that they should not be renewed, and break out with redoubled energy, from the recollection of former mis carriages. The fire may at present lie dor mant ; but, like its neighbouring volcanoes, it is not extinguished, and, sooner or later, it will burst forth, and bury in its ashes the ene mies of freedom, and lay the foundation of a new Pompeii or a new Herculaneum ! Parma and Modena are two small states, ex tending to the Po ; which river separates Mo dena from the Venetian territories, as it does Parma from the Milanese. The present Grand Duchess of Parma, Maria Louisa, Arch-duchess of Austria, Ex-empress of France, Queen of Italy, &c. &c. after her husband Napoleon was exiled to the Island of Elba, paid a visit, for the first time, to Venice, in company with her father, the Emperor of Austria, to condole with him on the death of his third wife, her mother-in-law and cousin ; she being; the daughter of the Arch-duchess VOL, II. L"], [162, "146 PARMA AND MODENA. Beatrice, sister to the late abdicated Queen of Sardinia, to the Duke of Modena, and to the Electress widow of Bavaria. It is necessary for me to mention thus precisely this long list of imperial ancestry, to show that nature will predominate, and that, when no longer re strained, and when the motives of ungovern able ambition no longer existed, this lady felt for her own dignity : though, while the allure ment of being the consort of the first sovereign in Europe was floating in her fancy, every con sideration of blood, of rank, of birth, and, I may say, of decency, was sacrificed to the am bition of sharing the usurped throne of one of her own relations. All, however, vanished and disappeared, as soon as the main spring of that ambition had been crushed and sent into exile. A lady of rank, the wife of a Venetian gen tleman, and a member of the republic of let ters, who had been commissioned to write a poem in praise of the Ex-emperor, \" her be loved husband and the dear father of her only son,\" \u2014 for such, it is said, was the language of the affectionate empress while the emperor was in his glory j \u2014 presented a copy of the said poem, which had been intended for Napoleon himself, had the events of the war not proved"], [163, "PARMA AND MODENA. 147 so fatal to him. Buonaparte, being, in point of generosity towards literary undertakings, which he encouraged as a part of his immor tality, very different from the great Wellington, had subscribed for a hundred copies, besides obliging his staff to subscribe for a hundred more ; but, as I have observed, from the above mentioned reverses, the copies were not taken, nor were they paid for. The author's wife, as well as the work, were both most flatteringly received by the dame d'atour of her imperial majesty, who assured the lady, that it should be instantly presented to her, at the same time requesting the lady to call at the palace on the following morning, when she would receive her imperial majesty's commands, and would probably have the honour of being admitted to her august presence. The work was printed in the best style, and richly covered with crimson velvet, embroidered, in the most costly and elegant manner, with the united arms of France and Austria, as com manded, in pure gold foil on each side of the oc ver, and the coronets inserted in coloured stones. The lady, according to directions, waited on the dame d'atour the next morning, and was ushered into a room, where she found her l 2"], [164, "148 PARMA AND MODENA. in bed, and by whom, to her great astonish ment, she was thus accosted : \" Madam, the empress, my august mistress, has commanded me to return to you the book, and to inform you, that she is much surprized you should have the hardihood to present her with any thing that relates to that bad man Napoleon : further, she desires me to say, that, as you are an Austrian subject, you may think yourself fortunate, that she does not denounce you to her imperial father, who would certainly punish you for your presumption, in presenting her with a work of the kind.\" The lady, though much surprized at such an unexpected reception, said \u2014 that if \" Na poleon were politically upon the list of dead sovereigns, his exploits were not so amongst great men.\" \u2014 \" Very like, very like : but Na poleon was a very bad man.\" \" Then, madam, if I am to be punished for having presented the work of my husband, what is to become of Cesarotti, who wrote an elaborate epic poem on the warlike achievements of the Archduke Charles\u2014 and who, when the Austrian army had been driven out of Italy by the French, only changed the name of Charles for that of Napoleon, and presented the identical work to"], [165, "149 PARMA AND MODENA. the French, instead ofthe Austrian, conqueror? And, did not the celebrated Monti, the author of the \" Bassevilliana,\" who wrote so much against the French and all the French parti zans, on Napoleon's becoming the master of Austria and the dictator of Europe, employ the whole of his time, during the reign of the said dictator, in expiating his first crime, by unceasing eulogia? In short, have not all the poets, for these twenty years past, nearly exhausted their genius, in singing the praises of the greathero, whose achievements have outstrip ped poetical imagination ? What punishment, then, ought to be awarded to the Emperor of Austria, for having accepted, sanctioned, and circulated many of these effusions ; giving his daughter in marriage to him, and she having not only accepted him for a husband, but sub mitted to have a child by him, knowing him, all the time, to be utterly unworthy of the sacri fice which they were both consenting to make ?\" To all which no other answer was given to the lady, but the repetition of the assertion, that Napoleon was \" a very bad man :\" but, from a motion of the dame d'atour, the lady was fully convinced, that her imperial majesty had been within hearing during the whole of the conversation. But, whether she was or was l 3"], [166, "150 PARMA AND MODENA. not, it is quite certain that the dame d'atour would never have dared to express herself in the manner she had done, if she had not been encouraged thereto by her imperial mistress. If such, then, were the sentiments of the wife of Napoleon, while he was still at Elba, what must they have been when he was lost, beyond redemption, in the Island of St. Helena, with no probability of her being any thing beyond an Ex \u2014 . But General will no doubt console her imperial majesty ; for he certainly has the credit of seeing more with one eye, than other persons can with two ! The reigning Duke of Modena is said to be the most frugal prince of the age. He travels with his own provisions ; and what he happens not to eat one day, is carefully packed up, and laid aside for the next. And truly, this is most praise-worthy conduct in sovereigns ; who, when they are on their travels, ought not to dissipate their incomes on postillions and inn keepers, but should rather bear in memory, that it is not talent or merit, but the sweat from the brow of the labourer, that pays the piper ; besides, according to the good old pro verb, \" waste makes want,\" and the man who thinks of a rainy day, is always prepared against state emergencies."], [167, "151 PARMA AND MODENA. By a rigid perseverance in this system, the late Duke of Modena, after years of the most rigorous economy in his table, his dress, and his household establishment, contrived to accumu late immense wealth; with the loan of which he would oftentimes assist his loving subjects \u2014 upon good security ! On the arrival of the French, he fled, with the treasures he had hoarded, to Venice ; which treasures he might have preserved ; but, rather than take a boat to himself, at the enormous charge of about fifteen or twenty ducats, he staid until the enemy arrived, and immediately disencumbered him of the whole of his property. So much for rigid economy ! The present Duke of Modena married, in June 1812, his niece, Maria Beatrice, the daughter of his sister, the Queen of the ab dicated King of Sardinia. The duke and the above queen are the offspring of the Arch duchess Beatrice and the late Arch-duke of Milan. She was heiress in her own right to Modena ; but she has given up the sovereignty to her son, and has only retained the smaller principality of Massa and Carrara, famous for its beautiful white marble. l 4"], [168, "152 CHAPTER XIV.

The seat of government was to have been divided between Venice and Milan ; but the court seldom left the latter city, except for a few days at a time. Indeed, the mode of living"], [169, "M I L A N. 153 at Venice is only calculated for Venetian-born subjects. Milan is situated in the very centre of Lom bardy, in a flat country, richly cultivated, and relieved from a monotonous appearance, by the fine views of the hills of Varese, and of Mount di Brianza, famous for its excellent wines. It is completely encircled by the Na vaglio, which is a source of considerable wealth, from the communication it affords to the rivers Tesino, Lario, Olona, Adda, and the Lago Mag giore, all of which run into the Po. From the immense number of hydraulic operations, Lom bardy is irrigated at all seasons of the year ; in consequence of which, it annually produces three, four, and even five crops of every neces sary as well as luxury of life. The peasantry in Austrian Lombardy, are, for the most part, landed proprietors, who are too wealthy, too much occupied with rural concerns, and too great epicures, to feel the least thirst after military glory. They are, therefore, of a disposition much less warlike than that of the rest of the Italians. The active movements that have shown themselves, announcing a desire to shake off the yoke ofthe foreigner, and of thereby secur ing the emancipation of their country, have"], [170, "154 MILAN. hitherto been confined to three classes ; name ly, the gentlemen of the bar, the literati, and the members of the ancient aristocracy. The Milanese are passionately fond of public amusements. They scarcely think of any thing but the pleasures of the opera, the Corso, or Le Belle Ragazze. Unless roused by the exam ple of their more warlike neighbours to exert themselves in the cause of their country, they generally look on until the blow is struck. Such was the case at the period of Murat's invasion, when they took especial care not to commit themselves ; and, by doing which, they then avoided the train of those horrible mur ders, exiles, and cruel military punishments, that were inflicted, by the exasperated con queror, on the inhabitants of the towns and cities of Italy which had offered a resistance ; and more especially upon the unfortunate Bo lognese. The people of Milan have had, from time immemorial, a certain compact among them, that whenever a foreign enemy shall have entered Lombardy, and arrived within a cer tain distance of Milan, the most courageous of its inhabitants shall be dispatched to the invading enemy, with the keys of their city ; as they have a proverb amongst them : \" salviamo"], [171, "155 MILAN. la panza, per i figlii.\" By so doing, they, at any rate, escape those horrors which are gene rally the attendants on the sacking of a city. Previously to the French revolutionists hav ing taken possession of this truly rich country, Milan was considered one of the most respect able cities in all Europe. It abounds in mag nificent public and private buildings, worthy, in every respect, of an enlightened nation ; amongst which are its hospitals and colleges, its churches, theatres, museums ; its amphi theatre, and its justly celebrated Duomo or cathedral, in which Napoleon was crowned King of Italy, with the corona di ferro, used by the Gothic Lombard kings on those occa sions, and where also he instituted the order ofthe Iron Crown, bearing for its device the words, \" Dio mi l'ha dato : guai a chi me la tocca !\" \" Oh, England, England, what a pro fanation hast thou made of this mighty man's works !\" exclaimed a certain member of his family, on his being sent to the Island of St. Helena. The profusion of luxury that was displayed on the above occasion, in decorating this im posing structure; the military pomp and parade; the splendid ornaments with which every part of the interior of this vast cathedral, the largest"], [172, "156 M 1 L A N. in Europe, was covered ; the profusion of spark ling diamonds, the costliness and variety ofthe dresses of the male and female attendants of the courts, not to mention those of the em peror and empress, the imperial family, the foreign princes, the ministers, the corps diplo matique, and the clergy, were, perhaps, never before equalled, and certainly not exceeded. In the midst of one of these fetes, Na poleon, observing that the Marchesa Busca, daughter of the Duke di Serbelloni \u2014 who, though very rich, was more inclined to be just, and charitable to the poor, than lavish and extravagant towards milliners and dress makers ' \u2014 observing, I say, that she always appeared at court in the same robes, said to her, in the hearing of the whole assembly, \" I am afraid, my dear Marchesa, that you have been very much fatigued?\" \u2014 \"Not in the least, please your majesty ; why should you think so ?\" said she. \" Because,\" answered the emperor, \"you have not been out of your clothes for these six days.\" The polished Italians call Lombardy the B\u0153otia of the peninsula. It has nevertheless produced some very distinguished men of let ters, as well as artists. Appiani, for instance, was considered the Milanese Polignotus and"], [173, "157 M I L A N. Apelles;^ and especially for his fresco paint ings. From his great knowledge of mythology, theology, and general history, no doubt was left of the subjects of his several compositions ; for they pointed out to the spectator, page, chapter, and verse, whence he had taken them. From the encouragement which Buonaparte gave to men of learning and science, Milan became the seat of literature. Cesarotti, Monti, Parini, Giani, and most of the modern Italian poets, made it their place of residence ; and particularly under the vice-consulship of Melzi, Duke of Lodi, whose administration was cer tainly mild, impartial, just, and disinterested ; until, unfortunately and fatally for himself, he became attached to the Sultana Grimaldi, one of the ladies belonging to the seraglio of Momfrin, the snuff-merchant at Venice, who afterwards married a gambler by profession ; whom Melzi employed, and through whose blind infatua tion, and that of Majon, Prince Eugene's secretary, another partner in her private fa-' vours, she soon became mistress of the most important situations under the government ; which she and her husband are said to have sold to the best bidders. During the tran sactions of the firm of Majon and Melzi with this man-trap, she contrived to carry on some"], [174, "158 M I L A N. very important, as well as lucrative affairs ; by which she not only dishonoured and dis graced them, but became the original cause of the unpopularity which discovered itself, on the part of the nobility, towards the vice roy himself. It was a fact well known at Milan, that Grimaldi married this Margarite Prati, the daughter of the poor Prati of Treviso, entirely upon speculation ; intending her for one of his customers, Nicoletto Cornaro, knowing him to have a penchant for women of her descrip tion ; and, by obtaining money from him in one way, and his new wife in another, he calculated on making a comfortable for tune between the two ; but the ruffian of a gambler succeeded better with Cornaro than his wife ; for he plundered him of considerable sums of money. The Prati, however, did not turn out to the good man's fancy ; upon discovering which, Grimaldi, mad with disap pointment, could not refrain from exclaiming, \" Zounds, I married the tall lath of a thing, because I thought she would just suit his fancy ; but his passion is now for the en bon point, and here am I saddled with this scrag of a trollop on my own shoulders.\""], [175, "MILAN, 159 This demirep and her husband, before they came to Milan, had been sent out of Paris by the police, in consequence of their having won a considerable sum of money from General Springporten, then the Russian minister. For tunate was it for them, that a considerable number of persons who had made themselves obnoxious to the people, took to their heels on the prince's leaving Milan ; for if they had not done so, assuredly many an additional umbrella would have been employed, in re venge for the public plunder, by which numerous individuals had enriched them selves. The Lombardian male creation are certainly not the descendants of those who discovered the use of the globes ; nor are they to be numbered amongst the most enlightened or civilized. Nevertheless, they are good-natured, disposed to render themselves useful, are at tached to strangers, and truly hospitable. The females are handsome, and inclined to the en bon point. They have fine eyes, and interest ing figures. They dress very becomingly, and attract notice ; until they open their mouths, when the admirer becomes instantly shocked and disgusted, at the vulgarity of their man ners, and at their gross Milanese dialect."], [176, "160 MILAN I Buonaparte certainly did every thing in his power for the benefit of the Lombardians in general, and for the happiness of the Milanese in particular. He promoted every kind of com merce, excepting that with England. He en couraged their manufactures, employed thou sands of hands in improving the public roads, and expended millions in beautifying their city, in planting trees, and in opening pub lic gardens and promenades for their accom modation and comfort. He also sanctioned various amusements for the recreation of the different classes ofthe people. The constant residence of a most brilliant and splendid court, presided over by a hand some, virtuous, and prolific princess, the mo ther of a numerous and a beautiful family, with a good-humoured, humane, aud well intentioned prince at their head, all tended, no doubt, to make Eugene Beauharnois popular, and the people attached to his authority ; which, though vigorous, was accompanied by incalculable advantages, which diffused them selves generally throughout Lombardy ; but which are now, alas, in part at least, if not wholly, fled ; from the change which the peo ple have undergone, in being placed under the yoke of Austria \u2014 a change, which has left the"], [177, "161 MILAN. strongest sense of regret in the minds of all those who are capable of comparing their present degraded situation, with the blessings which they once enjoyed. It is beyond doubt clear, that low, calcu lating avarice is the natural characteristic of a certain race of beings, in the same way as liberality and generosity are the distin guishing features of another ; and that both become hereditary in different families. Hence it is, that the immediate descendants of the immortal Maria Theresa were, in general, re markable for their generosity ; excepting one or two individuals, whose children, to this day, demonstrate to the world, that they put into rigid practice all the precepts of their undoubted maternal grand-father, and their father. The living examples to whom I allude, are his royal highness the Grand Duke of Mo dena, and his royal sister Leopoldina, widow of the late elector, Charles Theodore of Ba varia ; and, as they establish the existence of family virtues and family vices, I will here briefly narrate what has been told me of her royal highness the Electress Leopoldina, as I have already done of her royal brother of Modena. vol. n. .v"], [178, "162 MILAN Though the daughter of the Arch-duchess Beatrice, who was considered the best informed princess of the Austrian imperial family, the education of Leopoldina has been totally neg lected. Her manners and sentiments are far below those of a simple gentlewoman. With a perpetual desire to set about every thing, she is utterly incapable of effecting any thing that shall discover her to have been born a princess. Her unnatural and unconquerable aversion to all her family, and more especially to her mo ther, is her most striking characteristic. When the French entered Piedmont, her parents being on the eve of quitting Milan, the good elector, her husband, proposed their coming to Munich. \" And if they do,\" answered she, \" as soon as they enter at one door, out will I go at the other ; not a soul of the family will I have here.\" The elector, of course, desisted from his intention of inviting them, and they were, in consequence, obliged to proceed to Vienna. When her marriage with Charles Theodore, who was then seventy years of age, and she little more than seventeen, was first proposed to her, she enquired of the match-makers, \" whether she was to be a reigning sovereign ?\" Being answered in the affirmative, she replied,"], [179, "163 M I L A N. \" Then, I'd marry the devil to get out of my mother's clutches :\" and certainly, during the elector's life time, though they were as diame trically opposite in their natures, as mounts Caucasus and Etna, she conducted herself to wards her old lord and master with the most scrupulous constancy and fidelity, as well as in every other respect, excepting, perhaps, some trifling juvenile tricks ; such as going to the convents, with a number of young persons, like herself, then ordering a dance, and calling the poor pent-up nuns to the grate of the parlatorio, amusing herself with tantalizing them by talking of that which they could not enjoy, and cruelly asking them a number of questions, which had the effect of making them restless and uncomfortable for the remainder ofthe night. The electress contracted a partiality for a professional lady, of some celebrity, who was in the service of the court, and often invited her to accompany her in her morning walks at Niphenburg, The gardens being damp, the lady, on her return, wished, naturally, to change her dress. Upon observing which, the electress would exclaim, \" Mercy, on us ! you'll ruin yourself in washing ! Look here, and see what I do ;\" lifting up the front of her dress, which, m 2"], [180, "164 M I L A N. though very much soiled with the mud, she would roll up and fasten with two or three pins, and in this state she would set down to dinner with the old elector ; who was really a man of considerable talents. Sometimes, if the elector had happened to have displeased her \u2014 (and it is not very likely that an old German of seventy, had the faculty of pleasing a young woman in any great de gree) \u2014 she would go into the dining-room, and hide herself under the table. WThen the din ner was served, her husband would look round and ask where the electress was ? Upon which, she would pinch his gouty legs, and nearly spoil his dinner from the pain she would give him. Whenever she particularly wished for any thing, she would, like Lady Teazle in the School for Scandal, tell him how happy she was, and that she never would offend him again ; and, the better to gain her point, she would make him believe that she was in a thriving way. No sooner, however, had he granted her re quest, than she would exclaim, in a horse laugh, \" Lord, lord, what an idiot you must be, to fancy such a thing ! I shall always be a virgin, as long as I am your wife\" \u2014 \" io non posso sperare che lo spirito santo condescen ded di far mi altrimenti !\""], [181, "165 jM I L A N. She would have her court dresses cut and altered into six or seven different shapes and forms. When first made up, she would wear it as it came from the dress-maker ; secondly, she would order the front breadth to be changed ; in the third place, she would have different sleeves put to it ; fourthly, a new body ; fifthly, a trimming of flowers ; sixthly, a trimming of French blond ; seventhly and lastly, a trimming of ribbons. And, having done all this, she would laugh with the lady above alluded to, at the idea of her having so completely imposed on the females of the court, as to have kept them in total ignorance of the deception played on them by her avarice. It so happened, that the lady in question had invented a very handsome gold filligree trim ming, which she humbly presented to her royal highness, who was so much pleased with it, that she said she would sit for her picture and present it to the lady, in token of the satisfac tion she felt at the inventor's kind attention ; and, as it was near the season, when the court permitted a six months' conge to the first-rate performers at her private concerts, her royal highness told her she should have it, with the souvenir that the elector also intended to pre- sent to her previously to her departure from m 3"], [182, "166 MILAN. Munich. In addition to which, her royal high ness obligingly said, \" as the people of Munich have never heard you, I would advise you to take a public concert before you leave Bavaria. I will sing for you ; the orchestra and all the professionals of the court shall assist ; and, in the mean time, I will write to my aunts of In spruck and Naples, to request them to interest themselves in your behalf, if you should be in clined to give a concert ateither of those places.\" The lady thanked her royal highness, and acknowledged the sense she entertained of her very gracious condescension. She said, she should feel herself highly honoured by the let ters, but begged leave to decline the other parts of her royal highness's offer ; well know ing that her royal highness general sang in one tune, and the orchestra in another, \u2014 a circum stance, which, however it might pass in the court of an Arch Duchess, would never do with professors, nor before an audience, who, as they paid for their admission, might not be quite so indulgent to their sovereign, as they were when in the gallery of the court, into which they had been admitted gratis. Besides, this lady had already given her opi nion respecting the incorrectness of her royal highness's ear ; for, on the elector putting the"], [183, "167 M I L A N. question to her one day, she had replied, that \" the ears of her royal highness might have been otherwise engaged, but, that certainly she sang like a princess.\" At which the elector laughed heartily, as he was himself a great amateur, and had always the first Italian and German professors at his court. However, as ignorant people are generally the most head strong, her royal highness would take no denial ; and, as a further inducement, \" send me \" she said, \" a certain number of tickets ;\" which the lady of course thought her royal highness intend ed to distribute among the persons of the court. The price of the tickets was two crowns each. Her royal highness, however, sentthe court pages round to every individual at Munich she could think of) tothegreat disadvantage of her protegee; as many who would have been disposed to pay much more than the regular price, if they had come from the lady herself, did not chuse to do so by the electress. But, what is most extraor dinary, she actually paid the lady for the tick ets in Bavarian crowns, upon which there was a loss of a livre on each crown ; for her royal highness had certainly received French crowns, but her avarice led her to speculate on the most trifling objects. It was, however, so much gained towards the expence of the shoes of the pages ; M 1"], [184, "168 M I L A N. who had run about Munich to distribute the tickets. How different was the conduct of Mr. Dor ner, a merchant of Hamburgh ! for when this lady gave a concert in that city, he took a couple of hundred tickets at the above price, and, while entertaining her at breakfast, select ing one of the tickets out of the packet for his own use, and throwing the rest into the fire, he gave her a draft on his banker for the amount of the whole. At the death of the old elector, her royal highness most democratically took it into her head to set off from Munich with the brother of Heck, the first violin player of the court ; and, though he was only second in the orchestra, he managed his bow so well, as to play first fiddle on the heart of her royal highness ; for she actually would have married him, had they not been overtaken and arrested before she had an opportunity of putting her determination into execution. On her return to Munich, she was severely reprimanded for the step she had so rashly taken. On being told by one of her friends, that she was not the only Austrian princess who had formed a private attachment, but that for thinking of so far degrading and dishonouring"], [185, "169 M I h A N. herself and her family as to project a marriage with one so infinitely beneath her, she merited the severest punishment, she replied, \" no, if I cannot have him as my husband, I will have him on no other terms.\" Shortly after this, she was sent, under a strong escort, to Laybach, to which place she was exiled for some time, and in which she continued to carry on all sorts of commercial speculations. After the marriage of her late sister with the Emperor of Austria, she was permitted to return to Munich, where she mar ried a private individual, by whom she has had two or three children. To enrich them, she mo nopolizes as much as possible all the produce of the country, and is looked on as the forestaller of every article that grows on the earth. Upon market days, her apartments are crowded with farmers. She goes rarely to court, and sees no other society than that of brokers, farmers, and stock-jobbers. If an artist presents himself to her, she tells him she is not such a fool as to spend her money upon such nonsense as paintings, books, statues, poetry, and music. The lady above-mentioned having had occa sion, about four years ago, to pass through Munich, did herself the honour of paying her"], [186, "170 MILAN. dutiful respects to those truly amiable and truly paternal sovereigns, the present king and queen of Bavaria, and also to prince Eugene and his beautiful consort, and she there saw their lovely family. She also called on her royal highness, the late electress, who, to do her justice, received her while she was at dinner, with every mark of her former kind condescension. On enter ing the apartment, her royal highness ordered the servant to withdraw. The dinner consisted of a miserable mutton chop, a potatoe, a half pint bottle of wine, and a lemon, which she cut into two, and, together with the re mains of the wine, carefully put by for the next day. She complained bitterly of her poverty, and expressed herself mightily pleased with the lady's attention, in remembering her after the many years that had elapsed since she saw her. The electress putting by the half of a lemon and the dregs of a small bottle of wine, was in perfect unison with what I have related of her royal brother, the Duke of Modena, carrrying about his dinners from day to day, when on his travels. How few are there of the present race of princes who merit to be handed down to poste terity, for acts of charity, liberality, or gene-"], [187, "M I L A N. 171 rosity ! And, how grateful ought they to be to those men of talent who bring them into public notice ! From the rank which they hold in society, they ought to be distinguished, if I may be allowed the expression, for a vicious generosity ; for, as charity is said to cover a multitude of sins, so does generosity hide a host of defects ! But some of these eminent characters \u2014 to their shame be it spoken \u2014 are not only destituteof generosity, but of justice; and will even stoop to accept the mental labours of a female without paying for them ! Let such persons bear in mind, that a man of talent is the noblest work of the Creator. The antients were accustomed to reverence all such, and to look up to them with a degree of respect, bor dering on i-eligious veneration, and considered themselves honoured when men of genius con descended to notice them in the effusions of their brilliant imaginations \u2014 \" Sedtempora mutantur, et nos mutamur in illis.\""], [188, "172 CHAPTER XV.

I shall now redeem the promise which I made in my first volume, at page 275, and present my reader with some interesting anec dotes ofthe exploits of the Buonaparte Family in Italy, from the first arrival of the Corsican in the Milanese territory, down to the over throw of the grand Napoleon dynasty. The first time Buonaparte's name was men tioned in Italy, was at a dinner given at Flo rence by Lord Hervey, the British minister, to a gentleman who had come from Toulon"], [189, "M I L A N. 173 with Horatio Nelson, then the commander of the Agamemnon, in company with Mr. Ud ney the British consul at Leghorn ; at which dinner I had the honour of being one of the party. The loss of Toulon becoming the subject of regret, one of the gentlemen expressed himself in the following terms respecting the re-taking of it by the French : \" The most active and obstinate of all the officers,\" said he, \" was a little ill-iooking fellow with a sallow com plexion, whom I learnt to be a Lieutenant Buonaparte, possessing the most extraordinary countenance I ever beheld.\" This short speech, though of no great mo ment at the time, made a deep impression on my mind, more from the energy with whicli it was uttered, than from the importance of the individual who had been the subject of it ; as the name of Buonaparte had not at that period, excited the slightest sensation in Europe. This happened in the year 1793. However, two years afterwards, when Buonaparte came to Italy, at the head of the French army, so greatly had my curiosity been excited by the aforesaid energetic speech, that I determined on setting out from Venice, with a party of"], [190, "174 M I L A N. friends, for Milan, principally from a desire to see whether the countenance of the juvenile warrior answered the description which the gentleman had given of it. On our arrival at Milan, Buonaparte was then actually reviewing the troops in the Piazza di Castello, afterwards called the Fora Buona parte. On alighting from my carriage, I was placed in the best possible situation for view ing the young hero, and I must confess that I found him to answer, in every respect, the description that had been given me of him ; he being then extremely thin, and of a sallow complexion. When giving the word of com mand, he appeared to be perfectly in his ele ment : but, that being over, he instantly looked quite another being. He appeared evidently to be struggling to adapt and vary his features to the subject matter that was immediately engaging his attention ; but, the imperative and penetrating steady stare, which he darted on the persons he was conversing with, was evidently the result of a fixed principle, and done with the view of intimidating, and of put ting them out of countenance : thereby gaining time to himself, and creating a temporary ab sence and confusion in others, on the subject upon which they were interrogated. With"], [191, "MILAN. 175 Madame de Stael, I can truly say, that \" I never beheld Buonaparte, conversed with him, or heard his name mentioned, without experienc ing a most singular emotion, that would almost paralize my recollection.\" Shortly after this, I had an opportunity of having my opinions, with regard to the charac ter of Buonaparte, confirmed by a long per sonal interview. I was introduced to him by the Duke di Serbelloni, in consequence of hav ing had two carriages stolen from the public repository, by one of his generals, O'Pigion, at the period when the French entered Mestre. As the Venetian states had not at that time been openly violated, except in these partial plunderings, I applied for their restitution ; and, through the medium of my friend the duke, I obtained an order from Buonaparte to that effect; though he well knew, that O'Pigion had already disposed of them, as he had done of many others, for the benefit of the frater nizing gentry, who, at that time, under the name of liberty, appropriated every thing they could lay their hands on to their own use. Nor did I ever find reason to depart from my first impression with regard to Buonaparte, during the many opportunities which I after-"], [192, "176 MILAN. wards had of seeing and conversing with this most extraordinary man. Like Jupiter himself, he appeared to hold the destinies of human nature in his own hands ; operating like a destructive thunder bolt on every thing connected with morality and religion, with justice and honour. Is it therefore to be wondered at, that his misfor tunes and his ultimate downfall, should have been unaccompanied by any real regret ; except ing from those individuals who had lost their short-lived authority, and their fragile impor tance, by his political extinction ? The first knowledge that Barras had of Buo naparte arose out of the success of the latter, when commanding the troops against the insur rection of the populace at Paris, on the 13th Vendemiaire, 4th of October 1795. His name had begun to be a little popular, from his con duct at the retaking of Toulon from the Eng lish in 1793 ; but his notoriety may be dated from the period of the former scene of blood ; and, notwithstanding his own activity, and the party he had at Paris, all of them Habiles chiens de chasse, ardens oiseaux de proie,\" he could not save himself from the execra tion, which his cruel conduct on that bloody"], [193, "177 M I L A N. occasion had produced ; and accordingly, on the 9th of Thermidor, he was dismissed the ar my. As he was entirely without a fortune, or the means of procuring one, Barras contrived to have him appointed one of the Committee, whose business it was to defend the Constitutionalists. Tuscany and Spain were the first to acknow ledge the French republic. Next Prussia, at Basle in Switzerland, in the house of Rocco San fermo; then the Venetian minister, negociated for the same object. Sweden followed ; and Venice, wisely and cautiously, received the French minister, as the then representative of the \" French government,\" without committing herself) by giving to him any distinctive appel lation. This prudent line of policy, which, for fourteen centuries had been acted on by the Ve netian republic, was soon discovered to be too worn-out and threadbare, to make head agajnst the machinations of Buonaparte : and it has since been strongly affirmed, that if Austria and England had then consented to acknowledge the government existing in France, Italy would never have been invaded ; as the French govern ment was by no means inclined to, or in a situa tion for, offensive operations ; but were rather disposed to retain their troops as a necessary prop of their newly-adopted system, and to turn VOL. II. n"], [194, "178 M I L A N. their thoughts to their own domestic organi zation and commercial interests, instead of en gaging in external conquests. But England and Austria, in conjunction af terwards with Russia, refusing to make peace with the republic, and the French army on the Rhine, under General Moreau, having gained considerable advantages, the government at Paris, fearing a renewal of the disturbances of the 13th Vendemiaire, began to think seriously of liberating themselves from the tribunes, by a foreign war, as well as to find employment for the hordes of miscreants, that had fled from all parts of France, and had found ready refuge, and encouragement for the commission of every earthly crime, in that vortex of infamy, \" la bonne ville de Paris.\" The best way of accom plishing which, and of ridding the soil of France of this band of assassins, it was supposed would be, by enabling the cut-throats to satiate their rapacity for plunder in a foreign country. Many generals were applied to; but, not a soul of them could be prevailed upon to engage to pass the frontiers of France, from the ex hausted state of her finances, the wretched con dition of her credit, and the extreme difficulty of finding commissaries, who would engage to supply the army with absolute necessaries."], [195, "179 MILAN Just at this period, Barras, whether from be ing glutted to satiety, or from having formed an attachment to some fresh object, was desirous of getting rid of Josephine Beauharnois ; whose husband, if report speak true, was guillotined by his directions, on the very day, or rather the very night, on which he solemnized his ac quaintance with the lady. She was accordingly proposed by Barras to Buonaparte ; and, upon condition that he would forthwith marry her, the command of the army which was about to invade Italy, was to be the reward of his com pliance. Josephine having a tolerable stock of the commodity which is said to \" make the mare to go,\" and Buonaparte and his numerous rela tives being poor even to distress, both the terms of the agreement were instantly complied with ; and the modern Hannibal took upon himself the command of an army, consisting of thirty thou sand sans-culottes, without uniform, without arms, without money, without provisions, with out carriages, without horses ! Nor was it until they had reached Milan, that the necessary materiel was supplied them . Buonaparte once paid his addresses to Ma demoiselle Clery, sister to the wife of his brother Joseph, and now the reigning queen of Sweden ; N 2"], [196, "180 MILAN. but he was strongly opposed in his intentions by his mother, Madame Letitia, to whose wishes he used to pay implicit obedience, until he be came master of Italy ; when he ceased to accord any attention to the advice given him by any of his relatives. He had now begun to command, and would pay no obedience but to his own good will and pleasure. , \u2666' As soon as Buonaparte had reached the fron tiers of Savoy, he left the army, and, in company with his mentor Berthier, and Salicetti, his ad jutant-general of plunder, set off for Genoa, where he was sure of finding a number of par tizans, not only attached to him from revolu tionary principles, but from personal interest; as many of them had large capitals in the French funds, which had been reduced to the minimum of their nominal value ; but which he promised, if supported by them, to raise to par. And, a pretty par it was ! for he soon despoiled them of the remainder of their property, and annihilated the political existence of Genoa; \u2014 in gratitude, no doubt, for their readiness to become, in com mon with the rest of Italy, the willing slaves of his \" liberty and equality.\" At Genoa, Buonaparte soon formed an ac quaintance with Emanuel Balbi, one of the"], [197, "181 M I L A N. richest merchants in that city ; who, in company with Emanuel GneGco and Adamini, procured him the loan of two hundred thousand livres. This was the very first capital sum that Buo naparte had at his own disposal : and hence may be dated the ruin of Italy ; and, ultimately, his own destruction, from the. spur which it gave to his projects of unbounded ambition. At this critical juncture, General Depinois entered Milan with the ragged army of free booters, whose natural wants stimulated them to that species of courage which is commonly to be found in pirates. In their way thither from the frontiers of Piednont, they made free with carriages, waggons, horses, and every thing they could lay their hands on, to the utter ruin of the country that had the misfortune of being cursed with such unwelcome visitors ; but these little necessary appendages to an army only served as whets to their insatiable appetites. Liberty, fraternity, and equality, were the articles which they dealt out by wholesale : that is to say, they fraternized with the wives and daughters of their hospitable hosts ; they took the liberty to plunder them of their property; and they placed every thing on a footing of equality, by reducing the inhabitants of every town and village they passed through, to a state of misery and wretch- n 3"], [198, "182 M I L A N. edness hitherto unheard of.

While Buonaparte, Salicetti, and Berthier were thus busily employed in getting together the \" sinews of war\" at Genoa, Depinois took up his head- quarters at Milan, in the palace of Count d'Oppizoni. The lady of the house having invited him to dine with her at her own"], [199, "183 MILAN. table, observed to a friend who was present, that the general was so filthy in his person, and so dirty in his dress, and particularly in the ar ticle of linen, that she could not bear to sit at table with him. Her expression was, \" Guar date; ha una camisca come un farraio.\" How ever, Depinois had not been a week at Milan, before he had taken care to lay in a plentiful supply of wearing apparel, from the proceeds of the plunder of the churches, and private houses of the Milanese. The finest linen and cambric to be found in the shops of Milan were scarcely deemed good enough for the ruffianly marauder. When Moreau arrived from the Rhine, he was all astonishment at beholding the vast dif ference there was between the appearance of the army of Italy under Buonaparte, and the one which he himself commanded in Germany. The former resembled, he was accustomed to say, more the Hungarian body guard of the Empe ror of Germany, than the modest troops of a young republic. I have been assured by Fiorelli, Serrurier, Le Clere, and others, that the state of destitution in which the French army was, previously to its setting foot in the garden of Europe, was tlie primum mobile of the prodigious activity which distinguished their marches over the Alps: suc- N 4"], [200, "184 MILAN. cess or inevitable destruction being the only alternatives that presented themselves to their View. In the facility with which they accom plished their object, and the neglect of the Austrians in not sending a sufficient force to cover the Lombardian territory, and assist the Piedmontese in the narrow passes of the Alps, are to be found the real causes of the inveteracy of the Milanese against the Austrians ; since, if this precaution had been taken, it would have been physically impossible for the French army to have made any effectual resistance ; from their total want of the most common necessaries, and the debilitated state of mind as well as of body, in which they then were. Unfortunately, how ever, they were allowed to pass on unmolested; the court of Turin having made a precipitate flight, without leaving any decided instructions for the conduct of the government which re mained behind. I happened to be on a visit at Genoa, when the transactions between Buonaparte and Ema nuel Balbi of which I have spoken took place. On the following carnival at Venice, Balbi re turned my visit; and, in the course of conver sation, he assured me, that he had been repaid all the money he had lent, by a bill upon a mer chant in England, and, to the best of my recol*"], [201, "185 M I L A N. lection, in London, Balbi, though he had a tolerably handsome gentlewoman for a wife, was then paying his court to the beautiful Ve netian, La Barbaria. As Balbi, though rather an old man, wished to keep up the appearance of bustle and business, he generally invited the French parties to this lady's habitation. The society of the handsome Brignola, mother to the present minister at Turin, was also much culti vated by Buonaparte, as well as that of a Signor Fravega, during his stay at Genoa. For cer tain secret services which she had performed, the Brignola was afterwards made dame d'hon neur to Josephine, to the no small annoyance of the Castra to March esi, then one of her amo rosi; a passion which seized him, after he had scandalously deserted his English cliere amie, Mrs. Cosway, a lady of distinguished merit. The cause of the quarrel being made known to Buonaparte on his arrival at Milan, to give the devil his due, he certainly did every thing in his power to mortify the unsexed musician ; nay, he even went so far as to forbid the race of castrati to appear on the public theatres, and to direct, that the parts allotted to them should henceforth be given to females ; which continues to be the case to the present day. Buonaparte has at least the merit of having put an end to"], [202, "186 M 1 L A N. this disgraceful and disgusting manufactory of mutilated human beings When he was crowned King of Italy, the Empress Josephine wished much to hear Mar chesi sing. The gentleman of the doubtful gender was accordingly sent for ; but, as he at first refused to comply with the royal command, he was compelled by a military escort to obey the \" altissimo et augustissimo Imperatore;\" which titles were now at the head of all the decrees and public acts of the government. As soon as Buonaparte had got the two hun dred thousand livres, and had made a sufficient number of proselytes to the good cause of in surrection at Genoa and Venice, leaving Sali cetti behind him as his plenipotentiary and fac totum, he returned to Milan, and took up his head-quarters in the palace of the Duke Gal liaccio Serbelloni. This repectable nobleman, for many private reasons, had never been attached to the Aus trians. To save his country from destruction, he availed himself of the prerogative and privi lege which the Milanese had obtained, when they gave themselves up to the Austrians on their chasing the Spaniards from Milan ; and amongst those privileges was the one which I have already mentioned; namely,* that they"], [203, "MILAN. 187 should be allowed to deliver up the keys of their city, whenever an enemy should be within a certain distance of the capital, rather than submit to have it taken by storm. Serbelloni was one of the deputies sent, with others, on this melancholy mission. The above particulars were related to me by the Duke di Serbelloni himself, who was my particular friend, and with whom I became in timately acquainted, on my first visit to Milan, through the recommendation of the lamented Princess of Lamballe. I met the Duke at Paris, when he came there, by the order of Buona parte, as one of the seduced deputies, to offer him the consulship of Italy for life, shortly after he had caused himself to be elected Consul of France. The Duke di Serbelloni was a most excellent character, a nobleman of the old school, and a general benefactor of mankind. His heart was in the right place ; but he was a little weak headed, rather inclined to be credulous, and, of course, easily imposed on. He had gone too far to retract ; well knowing that Austria would never forgive the enthusiasm with which he, and the rest of the Italian deputies, had hailed the approach of the man, who so solemnly promised them liberty, and the emancipation of their"], [204, "188 MILAN. beloved country from the trammels of foreign interference. On Serbelloni's arrival at Paris, and going to the Tuilleries, Buonaparte embraced him cor dially, called him his \" caro amico ;\" told him he was his country's champion and liberator ; and directed him, on his return to Milan, to keep open house, to stir up and cultivate a party in his favour, as it was his intention to nomi nate him vice-consul of the Cisalpine republic. Whilst he was thus soliciting the favour and good offices of this popular nobleman, Buona parte had certainly no idea of causing himself to be made Emperor of France, or King of Italy. On the Duke's taking leave of me at Paris, previously to his return to Milan, he said, \" I know not the reason, but, somehow or other, it runs in my head, that if you do not shortly pay us a visit to Milan, we shall never see each other again ;\" adding, jocosely, to my husband, \" If you won't come for my sake, at least come and see your old sweetheart the Duchess.\" However, after he had expended considerable sums, agreeably to Buonaparte's directions, and while all Lombardy was rejoicing at the prospect of the worthy duke's elevation to the vice consul ship, the Corsican thought proper to nominate Count Melzi to the high situation. Whether"], [205, "189 MILAN from poison, from grief, or from remorse, poor Serbelloni died shortly after the above appoint ment took place, to the great grief of a nume rous family by whom he was beloved, of the poor to whom he was a generous benefactor, and of his friends by whom he was sincerely and justly esteemed. Though the Milanese had been constantly taxed by the Austrians, even in time of peace, for the maintenance of a standing army of twenty-four thousand men, when the French arrived amongst them, there were not within its walls above eight thousand troops. To this scandalous neglect is mainly to be attributed the disaffection of the Milanese towards the Austrian government, and the strong revolu tionary party which existed, and who were greatly and naturally incensed, at beholding themselves left thus unprepared for the long talked of invasion of their territories by the French. On his arrival, Buonaparte found the gates of Milan not merely open to receive him and his myrmidons, but taken off their hinges \u2014 never more to be closed against an enemy ! And here he remained for a considerable time, with the whole Ajaccian brood. The mother Letitia; the sisters, Paulina, Eliza, Caroline;"], [206, "190 MILAN the worthy uncle Fesch ; and the brothers Jo seph, Lucien, Louis, all established themselves in Milan ; together with General Le Brun, the generous, but duped cher ami of the beautiful Paulina Buonaparte, the present Princess Borg hese ; Le Clere, Berthier, Bernadotte, Murat, and many others. All the engines of democracy were set in motion, and every man and woman applied to, that was likely to become instrumental to his revolutionary projects. Among others, the beautiful Ruga, the elegant Lamberti, once the chere amie of the Grand Duke Leopold, the Sopranzi Visconti, and many others were now to become the pot-companions of Madame Josephine ; and the latter lady afterwards be came the awowed mistress of Berthier. The place fixed on for the conciliabulum of Berthier and Visconti, of Lecchi and Ruga, of Paulina Buonaparte and Le Brun, of the sister of Lecchi and Murat, was, for the good of human nature as well as of the fine arts, the house of the celebrated painter, Appiani ; where, too, \" La Madre Letizia\" condescendingly stood god mother to one of his daughters, who now bears the christian name of the good old lady. To the honour of the new democratical Cisalpine Republic, I should here state, that all"], [207, "191 MILAN. the official decrees run in these terms : \" La Madre Republica di Francia ordina, e com manda la figlia Republica Cisalpina,\" and so forth. What an honour for this newly-created puppet-show government to be \" ordered \" and \" commanded \" by the mighty French nation ! At that time, the young Eugene Beauharnois, the son of Josephine, was aid-de-camp to Ge neral Le Brun. Here, too, was planned the loudly vaunted battle of Lodi, whose much talked of bridge was passed, not by force of arms or by military bravery, but in consequence of the artful ma n\u0153uvres resorted to by the wily Corsican, to rouse the Italians to a pitch of enthusiastic madness in the supposed cause of indepen dence. Buonaparte would often exclaim, \" ora e venuta la regenerazione dell' Italia, e degli Italiani : liberta, independenza, e egualianza !\" These few fatal words electrified the people of Italy, and effected more for the invading gene ral, than he ever effected for himself, or than all his soldiers and cannon balls accomplished for him. This new inflammable matter burned, like another Etna, in the bosom of every Italian. Liberty, after two thousand years of slavery ! This was the acido carbonico ; this was the true gas, that made them soar in an element"], [208, "192 M I L A N. above human conception : or, more properly speaking, this was the hot-bed and nursery of all the exploits of the Corsican adventurer. The syren sounds of \" liberty, independence, and equality,\" that were now vibrated from one end of Italy to the other, were the all seductive weapons which bound them to his future ope rations, and which finally rivetted their fetters ; as will presently .be evident to every unbiassed and honourable mind. The way in which Buonaparte contrived to raise the edifice of his greatness was by first working on the minds of that class which, in all nations, are most easily seduced to rebel against their lawful governments. This once accomplished, he soon made himself master of their destinies. His next step was to induce them to send deputies, demanding of him their independence. By this crafty mode of pro ceeding, every city and province were promised that they should be guaranteed by him in their maniacal projects, in virtue of his undoubted right to protect them. Ridiculous as this plan may appear, it nevertheless completely an swered his purpose. He affected modestly to accede to every thing that was proposed to him. Never was there a mortal who so completely masked his real character, as Buonaparte did"], [209, "1IU.A N. 193 upon these occasions; though he took especial qare to do nothing that could, in the least de gree, militate against his own schemes of ag grandizement. It is an old saying, that \" love is blind ;\" and assuredly the love of liberty had at that time blinded the poor Italians most completely ! As soon as Buonaparte returned to Milan, he set about procuring the names of all the leading men in Italy, who were at all likely to further his revolutionary projects. In most of the cities and principal towns, he had soon contrived to station his apostles, who were ready to prepare the way for the introduction of his regenerated system ; and he took especial care to select his victims from among the higher classes, and to choose men who, from motives of ambition or of disappointment, and not at all aware of the frightful engine that was preparing for the destruction of their country \u2014 and under the weight of which they were themselves about to be crushed \u2014 unguardedly swallowed the gilded pill, and entered, bond fide, into, all his infernal projects. As these individuals were, in general, amongst the most distinguished for their wealth and cha racter, they were anxously looked up to by their inferiors and dependants, and their movements, VOL. II. o"], [210, "194 m l L A N. served as signals for the seduced and misguided multitude. I shall here present my reader with the names of a few of them. At Milan, there was the Duke di Serbelloni and his brother, Melzi, Belgioso, Moscati, Caluzi, Eluosi, Litta, Triculzi, Annoni, the general Pino, Oppizzoni, Cicopieri, and others of equal respectability. At Brescia, there were the general Lecchi, his brother, and his sister's husband, Martinengo, Tosi, and Gambaruce ; at Crema, Gambazocca, Cavalli, General Ga limberti, and Tadini : and at Turin, Breme and Satirano. At Genoa there were Brentano, the Brignola, Fravega, Doria, Emanuel Balbi, Gnecco, Adamini, Durazzo, and Guistinan : at Bologna, Caprara, Carbonesi, Aldini, Pepoli, and Ricci ; and at Vicenza, Anghisola, Tiene, Barbaran, Walmarano, Tressino, and many others. At Padua, there were Gaetano Onesti, Zigno, Ferro, San-fermo, Battaja, Zen : at Modena, Mullazani, Paulluci, Arrigoni : at Ferrara, Cicognara and Rangoni : at Rome, Borghese, Aldobrandini, Braschi, Justinan, Bonelli, Santa Crocie : and at Venice, Alvise Mocenigo, Alvise Pisani, Nicoletto Cornaro and his son, Delfin, the Tron, Widiman father and son, the Abbate Colalto, Barzoni, Contarini, Bragadin, Soranza, Fontana, Gradenigo, Qui-"], [211, "AI 1 L A N. 195 rini the brother of Madame Benzona, with Labbia and many others. To this long and sad list, may be added those classes which are ever ripe for a change in the established government ; namely, the poor who have nothing to lose, and the idle and turbulent, who were liberally rewarded for their endea vours to propagate and establish a system so favourable to their native love of robbery. The standing maxim amongst these regenerators of their country was, \" liberty to plunder the rich, and to put them on a level with the lowest and most miserable classes, by a division of their property.\" I do not hereby wish to insinuate, that there were not, in the several governments of Italy, abuses that called loudly for reform ; but that reform was not to be effected by the means resorted to by \" I Romani in Greca,\" or by the French in Italy. I assert, and I do it fear lessly, that your aristocratical reformers who have acted upon democratical principles, have uniformly fallen the victims of their own mis guided policy, wherever they have set them selves up in opposition to their own order. The contributions of men and of cattle, of money and of provisions, of statues, of gems, and of pictures, that were levied by Buonaparte o 2"], [212, "196 M I L A N. in Italy beyond all calculation. \" Live and let live \" was assuredly his maxim, as far as regarded those who acted under him. Every one of his generals, without distinction, was suffered to levy these contributions ; and it is generally believed, that he had always a stipu lated share of the booty. Augereau, Massena, and Lecchi were the very Attilas and Theodo rics of the modern French regenerators of the poor, suffering Italians. Massena, wherever he had any command, plundered in the most un merciful manner. A report of his cruel exac tions being made to Buonaparte, he answered, \" if I had two Massenas, I would hang one of them by way of example to the other ; but as I have only one, all I can do is to order the restitution of the property ;\" and accordingly, one of his aid-de-camps was despatched to desire that the plundered effects might be sent to head quarters. \" Is this all that you have to communicate ?\" said Massena, \" then tell Buo naparte, that if he ever talks to me about send ing the plunder to head-quarters, I'll take care he shall soon move those quarters. The trum pet is now sounding, and I am called elsewhere ; inform the general, that after the battle, we will settle accounts, and then we shall see who has plundered most.\" Any other man but"], [213, "197 M I L A N. Massena would have paid for these expressions with his life; but, as the Corsican truly observed, he had only one Massena in his army, and that one was too useful an instrument to be sacrificed at that moment. It is however well known, that he afterwards made him disgorge a considerable part of his plunder ; \u2014 though it certainly never found its way back to the pockets of the right full owners !

I shall here introduce a few domestic anec dotes of some of the leading branches of the new imperial dynasty. To begin with the o 3"], [214, "198 M I L A N. parent trunk. Madame Letitia Fesch, the wife of Charles Buonaparte, and the mother of \" Napo leon the Great,\" was at one time considered the most beautiful woman in all Corsica. When Count Marb\u0153uf, the governor of that island, first became a candidate for the favours of this lady, she was the humble wife of a poor half starved attorney living at Ajaccio, a deserted spot in this more than demi-savage island. A friend of mine, who, while the British army was in Cor sica, supplied it with bread, has assured me, that little Jerome, who was afterwards made King of Westphalia, was then a poor miller's boy, and used to carry the flour in sacks to the different depots of provisions. The same gentleman like wise declared to me, that Eliza Buonaparte, the late Grand Duchess of Lucca Piombino, was the keeper of a billiard table ; which she attended to in person, and where she got acquainted with the British officer, by whom she afterwards had a child. When Madame Letitia first came to Milan, she was accompanied thither by her daughter Paulina, afterwards the princess Borghese, who, from her beauty and her various accomplish ments, soon attracted, amongst others, the at tention of General Le Brun. Whether or not"], [215, "M I L A N. 199 it was for value received, it is impossible for me to say ; but, from the extraordinary sums he lavished upon her, he was soon obliged to quit the army, and even Milan itself. Through the industrions manoeuvres of her mother, she shortly afterwards married General Le Clere ; which marriage was kept at the pa lace of the Duke di Serbelloni, and at which, as I have already mentioned, I was myself present. So notorious was the avarice of Madame Le titia, that it soon became the subject of general conversation at Milan. It was even asserted that she cultivated an acquaintance with the family of the celebrated painter, Andrea Appiani, from motives of the most refined eco nomy, and that she might have her own por trait and those of her family, painted at the price of a grazia \u2014 a coin with which it was very common for the good lady to reward the labours of the several artists she employed ! Letitia condescended to stand god-mother to one of Appiani's daughters, and the child was even permitted to have the amazing honour of being named after the mother of a whole brood of forth-coming sovereigns \u2014 an honour which, of course, more than compensated the painter, for any expence he might have been at, in co- o 4"], [216, "200 JI I L A N. lours, brushes, canvaSj and carved frames ; of for any extraordinary pains which he might have taken, to hand down to an admiring poste rity.* the lineaments of a lady, who had been so great a benefactress of the world ! I must, however, do one piece of justice to Madame Letitia. On her being informed of the arrest of the unfortunate Duke d'Enghien, she flew to her son Lucien, and begged of him to accompany her to the Tuilleries. When ar rived there, she made use of all the authority over the First Consul, which a mother might be supposed to possess. She pointed out to him the danger to himself of committing so foul, and at the same time so useless, a crime, upon the person of a prince, who was so highly esteemed by all France. Finding that all her intreaties only strengthened her son's determination to order the immediate execution of his bloody purpose, she threw herself on her knees before him, and implored mercy for the unfortunate prince. Not being able to free his hands from her powerful grasp, Napoleon actually spurned his mother from him ; and Lucien, in endeavour ing to stop the progress of any further violence, would have been struck also, had he not warded off the kick, by giving the aggressor a tremen dous blow between his mouth and nose, whicli"], [217, "M I L A N. 201 levelled the little man, as well as his mother, with the ground. The noise occasioned by the scuffle brought Josephine into the apartment, who assisted in wiping away the blood from her husband's face. But, though in great pain from the violence of the blow, Buonaparte had scarcely been seated, before he exclaimed, \" I'll make all my bro thers and sisters princes and princesses, except you, you vile wretch !\" The above circum stance, singular as it may appear to those who are unacquainted with the family, may be relied on as a fact; and it most probably was the ori ginal cause of Napoleon's treating Lucien with such marked indifference ; for he was the only one of his relations, who dared to reproach him with misrule, and an abuse ofthe authority which he had arrogated to himself. In a pecuniary point of view, however, it was not in the power of Napoleon to injure him ; for, while he was ambassador in Spain, Lucien, from the personal interest which he had in all the vessels furnished with letters of marque, that sailed from the different ports, contrived to have the prizes taken by those vessels adjudged in his favour ; so that, from the immense sums which he accumu lated in this way, and from the millions of livres which he received as his reward for signing the treaty of peace between Spain, Portugal, and"], [218, "202 MILAN. France, the modest Lucien had pretty well feathered his nest. Madame Letitia was so parsimonious, that she would seldom or ever dine at her own house, and never failed, when at Salicetti's, to order to be sent home to her what might be left at table, giving by way of excuse for so doing, that her own cook was very unskilful in these matters, and could not hit her palate. On the day when she had no invitation abroad, she would bargain with her own maitre d'hotel, and purchase of him what he might happen to have in the house at half price. She never paid a visit to any of her imperial children without bringing some thing away with her. She would caution them to take care and lay by something against a rainy day ; \" Pensatevi figlii miei,\" she would say, \" non si sa cosa arrivera domani\" \u2014 Reflect, my children ; we do not know what may happen tomorrow.\" The poor Pucelle d'Orleans was put to death for witchcraft ; but the good pro phet, Letitia, has been suffered to console herself quietly at Rome, for the upset of her imperial house, with the spoils which her frugality and parsimony had enabled her to save out of the wreck of revolutionized Europe.* * Dr. O'Meara, (who, by the bye, is said to be partial to old gentlewomen) informs us, in his most veracious \" Voice from St. Helena,\" that, in 1819, this old lady's thoughts were"], [219, "203 M I L A N. Josephine Tescher Beauharnois, previously to her marriage with the great Napoleon, had been the mistress of Tallien, Barras, Talma, and, if rumour be correct, of many others. Her person was handsome, and her manners were graceful, fascinating, and elegant. When she first came to Milan, as the wife of the young general, her chief companions consisted of the very lie du peuple ; amongst them were the Sopranzi Vis conti, who shortly after became the mistress of Berthier, Prince of Neuchatel ; Lamberti, the ex-mistress of Leopold, the Grand Duke of Tus cany, together with Castelbarca, and Tanzi, \u2014 anciennement belle, mais a present un peu passee. The other ladies with whom Josephine asso ciated at that time were all of the same stamp ; and not a little did they contribute to the ex pensive democratical entertainments given to Madame Buonaparte, and her train of Italian regenerators, out of the contributions which they levied from the numerous votaries, at the shrines of their beauty. Nothing could well equal the enthusiasm in \" the good cause,\" with whicli these demireps contrived to animate the entirely \"divided between God and her son\".' Verily, Mrs. Cole, thy piety was nothing, in comparison with that of la madre Letizia!"], [220, "204 Jl 1 L A N. gonzi, or dupes ofthe day. Madame Josephine was the goddess, at whose altar every one paid their devotions, and every where was she hailed as the double of the youthful Italian regenerator. Not a sound escaped the lips of these fraternals, that did not vibrate from one end of Italy to the other. \" Liberty and equa lity ! freedom and independence !\" were words, not only in the mouths of all, but even chalked over the door of every habitation. All, how ever, ended in the divide et impera ! Montaigne says, that, \" if there be a God, he must be just.\" The end of Buonaparte must have convinced the world that there is a God ; and that that God is a lover of justice! Up to the period of the battle of Lodi, the above spirit-stirring words were constantly at the tongue's end ofthe credulous and abused people of Italy. Fetes of every description were given on the occasion ; and, at one of them which took place when the delirium was at its height, Josephine was mightily taken with a female art ist, who performed admirably on the violin; a Madame Paravicini, one of the numerous indivi duals whose professional abilities were put into a state of requisition, for the amusement of this all powerful regeneratrice. Josephine was amaz ingly delighted with this lady's performance, es*"], [221, "M 1 L A N, 205 pecially as she enjoyed it gratis, and gave her an invitation, in general terms. Madame Paravicini, having recently married, against the consent of her relatives, a young man of family, not overburthened with riches, and being, in consequence thereof, wholly dependant on her talents for a subsistence, cultivated the patronage of Josephine, in pre ference to her own interest ; conceiving that her popularity as an artist who had just made her debut in public, would be greatly promoted, by the powerful countenance and protection of this Mec\u00e6nas in petticoats. Not aware of a fact which then began to be generally known ; namely, that Josephine's real name was \"Take all and pay none,\" and that she had learned how to conjugate the verb to have, but not the verb to give, Madame Paravi cini continued to perform for her every day, during her residence at Milan; where there was a continued round of parties. And, that every thing might be en regie, she had also the high honour of giving lessons on the violin, two hours in the day, to Josephine's son, Eugene Beauhar nois, who was at that time aid-de-camp to ge neral Le Brun, and to whom she lent a most valuable instrument, made by Steiner. When the great lady was about to leave Mi-"], [222, "206 MILAN. lan, she enticed, by her flattering promises, this poor young artiste to follow her to Paris, and paid her for her past trouble, with a \" Comme vous etes charmante ! Je vous remercie infini ment: adieu, ma belle ! au revoir, ma chere, a Paris.\" Deceived by her apparently affable conduct, both husband and wife were credulous enough to follow their liberal patroness to the French metropolis. On Madame Paravicini's arrival there, being then far advanced in her first preg nancy, she was taken dangerously ill, from the fa tigue ofthe long journey, and had no other means of subsistence, but what might be derived from the sale of their wearing apparel. Having at last disposed of every thing, and being in a strange country and totally destitute of the ne cessaries of life, she bethought herself that she would write to Josephine, to solicit of her at least the payment of the sum due for the violin which she had lent her son to learn on. The instrument was worth from eighty to a hundred louis d'or ; to which was to be added the sum due for the lessons she had given to young Beauharnois. However, to this just application she received for answer, that \" Madame Jose phine was astonished she should be called on for the payment of a violin, which she imagined"], [223, "M I L A N. 207 had been sent to her son as a present ; that she knew nothing respecting the instrument, or the lessons given to Eugene; and desired therefore that she might be troubled no further on the subject.\" Driven almost to desperation by the above unfeeling answer, Madame Paravicini was under the cruel necessity of applying to the Italians then resident at Paris ; who kindly made up amongst them a subscription for her ; not pro claiming their good deed, pro bono publico, on \" the house tops,\" as is the case in some countries, and by which the remedy is often rendered as painful to the wounded feelings of the patient, as was the disease itself; but col lecting the needful together quietly, from a few real friends of suffering humanity. With the money thus obtained, the lady was enabled to redeem her apparel, and to return to Milan. I never take up an English newspaper, and read \" A Case of Distress,\" with the name of this or that Royal Duke, ostentatiously stuck at the head ofthe list of subscribers, \u2014 but who, nine times out of ten, perhaps, never actually pay down the money affixed to their names, \u2014 without thinking of the real charity of her coun trymen to poor Madame Paravicini, and without calling to my recollection, the advice ofthe great"], [224, "208 MILAN founder ofthe Christian religion \u2014 \" When thou givest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth !\" But, in the cases I have alluded to, not only the \" left hand\" is made acquainted with the gift, but every man, woman, and child, who is capable of reading a newspa per ! But \u2014 verbum sat sapienti. So much for Madame Josephine's want, not merely of generosity, but of common honesty. This circumstance took place before she had been dubbed an Empress. The .whole particu lars of her dishonourable conduct were related to me at Dresden, in the year 1803, by both the Paravicinis, after I had been dining with them at the house of M. Lavallette, who was then the French minister at the court of the present king of Saxony, and who afterwards was liberated from a prison at Paris, through the gallant ex ertions of Sir Robert Wilson, an English general and Member of Parliament. That Buonaparte had formed the intention of repudiating Josephine, long before he married Maria Louisa is certain : for when at Verona, he was accustomed to enquire who were the richest noble young ladies ; and, having seen two whom he liked, he proposed to Berthier, that if he would take one of them, he had no objection to take the other himself. Berthier"], [225, "209 M I L A N. was, however, too much attached to the Vis conti, a low Italian woman whom Buonaparte detested, to think of marrying ; and his de parture for Campo Formio put an end to the speculation. So little of a democrat was Buonaparte, that he could not bear to associate with low women, except for the moment. He was greatly dis pleased with Lecchi, for forming an attachment to the Ruga ; nor was he satisfied with the mar riage of General Pino with the dancer Pellesina, though she brought him an ample dower, and had been previously married to the Marquis Calderara. By Pino's marriage, too, Buonaparte saved several thousand livres ; as he had twice paid the general's debts. It has been said, that Buonaparte was one of the innumerable innamorati of Madame Gras sini; but the fact has never been established, nor was he ever observed to be more attentive to her, than he was to the other opera singers. Most probably the signora was herself the inventor of the rumour, that she might have greater influ ence with a certain Royal Duke, a member of numberless philanthropic societies, and a pro digious collector of Bibles, who afterwards be came the protector of Mrs. Billington. Just as if a woman, who had been as common as a VOL. II. P"], [226, "210 MILAN. country whipping-post, could raise her reputation on the fame of one man more than on that of another ! She afterwards married a young man of the name of Ragona,whom she had never seen but once; and, as she \"longed,\" like Lucy in the Beggar's Opera, \" to be made an honest woman of,\" she gave him a considerable sum of money. In a short week after the marriage, the bride set off for Paris, to follow her old trade ; leaving Ra gona at Bologna, the place of his birth, there to enjoy the fortune which he had so easily and so honourably obtained ! With respect to Buonaparte, it is evident that ambition and thirst of conquest was the rul ing passion, which, \" Like Aarons serpent, swallowed up the rest;\" and, to this may be mainly attributed the fact, that he never discovered a propensity to those other vices which are so common to all our great heroes. Buonaparte was subject to violent hysterical fits during the night; and, when in that state, he was remarkably communicative. On this ac count, the prudent Josephine was extremely careful that he should form no connexion that might entice him from her bed. To effect her purpose, she expended considerable sums on"], [227, "211 MILAN spies of all descriptions, whose duty it was to acquaint her if any such connexions existed ; since he might, when the fit was on him, di vulge to them certain state secrets. In this pre cautionary step she was mainly assisted by her factotum Fouche, and his innumerable runners. Many a female was banished from Paris on mere suspicion ; and Grassini would never have been allowed to remain in that capital, or to have sung at Josephine's private concerts, had the great lady for a moment suspected, that her husband had the smallest attachment to the syren. When Josephine was at Milan, the Count Sommaglia said to her, \" I hear that our Gras sini is a mighty favourite with the Emperor.\" \" Yes,\" said she, \" the ridiculous vanity of the creature amuses us amazingly : she sometimes sings a duet with Qrescentinh.when they happen to be good friends ; but, since she has been made by the Emperor directress of the Italian opera, there is more intriguing going on amongst these gentry than there is at court : in the midst of a serious conversation she will break out into a horse laugh, throw herself on a sofa, and, fancying herself Semiramis on the throne of Nineveh, will burst out in great style with, ' Son Regina e son amata !'\" P 2"], [228, "212 M I L A N. As soon as Josephine had been crowned Queen of Italy, she entirely forgot her old de mocratical pot-companions, and refused to see any of them, male or female. She did not, how ever, forget, at the last court day, to recommend her son, Prince Eugene, who was then made Viceroy of Italy, to all the old nobility. She went round to each of them, entreated their affections for her \" dear Eugene,\" as she was accustomed to call him, and expressed a hope, that if he might- happen not to do all that the Milanese should expect of him, they would kindly consider his youth, and his dependant situation. \" His heart,\" she would say, \" was good, and she therefore trusted they would take the will for the deed, and assist him with their kind counsels ; of which, from his inexperience, he would so much stand in need.\" She was certainly most passionately attached to herson, and could never take leave of him, but with evi dent marks of the bitterest anguish."], [229, "213 CHAPTER XVIII.

The overthrow of the Venetian republic, the particulars of which I have given in my former volume, was soon followed by that of the rest of Italy. Ferrara, Bologna, Tuscany, Parma, Modena, Rome and Naples, were stripped of all the chef-d'\u0153uvres of art ; which were sent on their travels, until they should arrive at the con queror's \" good city of Paris.\" Buonaparte now directed his attention towards the Roman States and his Holiness the Pope, with a view of avenging the insult ofthe Bas villiana ; but he was stopped in his career by the p3"], [230, "214 M 1 L A N. famous peace of Tolentino. The once mistress of the world was plundered of her most valuable monuments of antiquity, and Pius the Sixth was soon afterwards sent prisoner to France. Na ples, as my readers will have already seen, had been previously revolutionized, and had taken the name of the Republic of Parthenope ; in conse quence of which, Buonaparte returned to Ve rona, and from thence to Milan. I do not recollect, that the great man ever visited Rome or Naples, or even Florence. The only people in Italy, who made any vigorous opposition to the revolutionary army, were the people of Arezzo, in Tuscany, already noticed. All Italy was, by this time, divided into dif ferent republics, kept in subjection by French troops, governed by French magistrates, and following French fashions. The air only, the soil, and the climate \u2014 things which the mighty Buonaparte could not change \u2014 remained instatu quo, unpolluted by the Gallic disease \u2014 though, even the very earth had been impoverished, by the numerous different armies that had entered that unfortunate country : \u2014 for revolutionists and imperialists alike brought with them nothing but desolation and destruction ! The different invasions of Italy, by the troops of Russia and Austria, took place chiefly while"], [231, "215 MILAN Buonaparte was engaged on his notable expe dition to Egypt. The Russians soon becoming dissatisfied with the conduct of the Archduke Charles, withdrew their army, and left Austria in full possession of the whole of that country : but, the vacillating manner in which the Aus trian cabinet conducted itself towards the Ita lians, was by no means calculated to promote their influence in that country. Every thing done by them was \"provisional.\" In their civil and military operations, there was no solid gua rantee for the people ; who were, in consequence, kept in a state of unceasing perplexity and irri tation. The most unjustifiable arrests took place of many Venetians, who were not subjects of Austria when the crime imputed to them had taken place; namely, that of having embraced the democratical government, after the aristo cratical one had abdicated ; and who were, therefore, certainly not amenable to the juris diction of Austria. Notwithstanding which, chained together like malefactors, they were sent, as galley-slaves, to the different fortresses in Hungary. This conduct of Austria towards her newly purchased subjects, was surely most harsh and unjustifiable, and little calculated to make her yoke popular with the people of Italy. Besides, p 4"], [232, "216 M I L A N. the general confusion that took place in the or ganization of the government \u2014 which, as I have said, was only a provisional one, \u2014 caused such a stagnation in every department, as was of itself calculated to promote universal dissatisfaction. But, added to this, the discharging of nearly all the persons before employed in the public offices, the persecution of others merely for their opinions, the shutting up of the free masons' clubs and the declaring their members incapable of holding any public situation \u2014 all these things naturally created an unconquerable disgust in the minds of the people against the Austrian government. The same impolitic persecutions also exaspe rated their former subjects, the Milanese, against them. Being by this time habituated to the polite and insinuating manners of the French, they began to look upon the Germans as a na tion of uncouth intruders \u2014 not to bestow on them a harsher appellation ! Buonaparte had his emissaries established in all parts of Italy. When he was in Egypt, he was acquainted with every thing that was going on there, as well as in France. Was it, indeed, to be supposed, that a man who, from the moment of his entrance into Italy, had formed the design of appropriating"], [233, "M I L A N. 217 the sovereignty of that country to himself, and who was only waiting for the moment the most propitious to its accomplishment, had lost sight of so vast an object? Did he not, on his return to France from Italy, sound Barras upon the subject; telling him, that they had offered to make him Duke of Milan and King of Italy ; and adding, \" Mais je ne pense a rien de semblable dans aucun pays?\" And, did not Barras reply, \" Vous faites bien de n'y pas songer en France ; car si le Directoire vous envoyait demain au Temple, il n'y aurait pas quatre personnes qui s'y op poseraient?\" This spirited reply of his friend and protector convinced Buonaparte of the necessity of ab senting himself from France for a time, as the only means of avoiding the daily stabs which the Directory encouraged, and permitted to be pub lished, at his growing popularity ; as nothing was left him to execute, but the mad pro ject of invading this country. The conqueror of Italy had, indeed, no alternative but that, or the scarcely less ridiculous project, of subjugat ing India, through the medium of an expedition to Egypt \u2014 an enterprize, which, at the same time that it saved his own person, flattered the credulity and the vanity of the French."], [234, "218 MILAN. As a further proof of his boundless ambition, did not Buonaparte cause Madame de Stael to be banished for twelve years from Paris, because her father, M. Neckar, after the interview he had had with him on Mount St. Gothard \u2014 in the course of which interview the latter discovered his projects of aggrandizement \u2014 published a political work, putting the French upon their guard against the encroachments of Buonaparte, or of any other military chief, who might at tempt to violate their liberties, and restore those abuses, which, after so many sanguinary conflicts, they had succeeded in annihilating? That neither Buonaparte, nor any of his re lations and kindre'd, were ever republicans at heart, nor advocates for a democratical form of government, any further than as it could be rendered subservient to their long-stifled views of ambition, has been evinced by every succeed ing event ; since that form of government has, on every occasion, been laid aside, whenever it could be done without compromising their own personal safety : a fact this, which will be abundantly established in the course of the fol lowing pages. Indeed, long before this, Napoleon Buonaparte had caused himself to be appointed one of the Triumvirate, with Le Brun and Cambaceres ;"], [235, "MILAN 219 who were of the same service to him, as link boys are to pick-pockets; the former, by keeping the royalists in the dark; the latter, by holding up \" le revers de la medaille.\" But, when he found he no longer stood in need of their arti ficial light, they were themselves extinguished, like the snuff of a candle, and pronounced mere noun-adjectives \u2014 the substantive Buonaparte having, ex-abrupto, declared himself Consul for life! To shew the falsehood of Buonaparte's asser tion to Doctor O'Meara at Saint Helena, that he wished to be considered \" 1'homme du peuple,\" and still further to prove, that neither himself, nor any of his family ever had a grain of democracy in their composition, I shall here insert a valuable document, which will prove to my readers, that, so far back as the year 1789, his brother Joseph was anxiously labour ing to prove himself descended from an ancient Italian family, and humbly supplicating the Grand Duke of Tuscany to bestow on him a knighthood of the order of San Steffano. What a striking instance of the vicissitude of all earthly events !

A brief, but, I think, an interesting detail of Buonaparte's conduct towards his Holiness, will"], [245, "229 MILAN. have been found in a former chapter of the present volume. The next proof of Napoleon's attachment to royalty was in sending his brother Lucien am bassador to Spain, there to negotiate, at the price of twenty millions of livres, the erection of the short lived kingdom of Etruria, in favour of Charles the Fourth's son-in-law, the nephew of the Duke of Parma, whose territories had been previously violated and plundered. For which purpose, that imbecile puppet of a Duke, was now to be exhibited at Paris, by way of echantillon of Buonaparte's new kingly manu factory. On the first night of the prince and princess making their appearance at the French opera, they were assailed with the most dis gusting epithets ; such as \" vilain crapaud, est-tu venu ici pour faire la cour aux assassins de vos parens ?\" \" Partout nous vous chasse rons.\" \" En bas, en bas, avec ces f de princes !\" were the cries from all parts of the house. Buonaparte, however, took care not to shew his face at the opera that evening ; and the poor gingerbread king and queen of Etru ria were accompanied to their hotels, with the same, if not worse, language, from the mouths of the \" dames de la Halle ;\" and it was with the greatest difficulty that they reached their apart- Q 3"], [246, "230 MILAN ments, without that personal injury, which was alone prevented by the military in attendance upon them. It was also necessary to keep their departure a secret from the said Dames, who were busily preparing for them, a leur fas on, some additional proofs of their attachment. They left Paris in a private and precipitate way, and thereby escaped the honours laid up in store for them. But, having turned their backs on Paris, they were no longer in danger. All the leading persons attached to the old school of monarchy were now courted by Buo naparte, and flattered with the restoration of it ; and were even so far gulled as to be made to believe, that he actually intended to replace the Bourbons on the throne of their ancestors. The \" Moniteur, \" the official newspaper, was every day filled with fabricated articles, an nouncing Buonaparte's magnanimous intentions in this respect. The wife of the well-known Clery, the faithful domestic of the unfortunate Louis the Sixteenth, was dining with me one day, during the appearance of these rhodomon tades ; and, quite overjoyed, she shewed me a paper. \" There,\" said she, \" I am or dered to write to my husband ;\" who was in Germany with the Countess de Lille, as she was then called, the wife of the present King"], [247, "231 MILAN. of France. This paper, was a sort of gua rantee from the police. She enclosed in her letter to her husband many of these articles from the Moniteur ; but a Madame Beaumont, a natural daughter of Louis the Fifteenth, and very much like him in person, who lived with her, was not so ready in her behalf. She had had an intimation given her of what had been going on between Buonaparte and the Prussian minister ; who had dispatched a well-known author and public character, now in England, on the famous mission to Warsaw, with propo sitions to induce Louis the Eighteenth to give up his pretensions to the throne of France, in favour of Buonaparte, and not expressions of a wish, on the part of the latter, to replace the former on the throne of his ancestors. The said propositions were, however, rejected with utter disdain. At this time, emissaries were dispatched all over Germany, for a purpose, if possible, osa still more heinous nature, and in the accomplishment of which the Corsican's mouehards were equally unsuccessful. The object of Buonaparte was the entrapment of the royal family of France, par ticularly the queen, in a manner similar to that which had led to the ever-execrable murder of the Duke D'Enghien\u2014 from the spilling of q4"], [248, "232 MILAN whose blood sprung a grand dukedom. This atrocious deed, together with the sale of the Venetian states to Austria, for ever blackened the fame and blasted the laurels, that Buona parte had gained by his military achievements ; as they were both of them the most wanton acts of cruelty and injustice, that were ever resorted to by a man in possession of unlimited authority. The deception practised by Murat towards the unfortunate Duke d'Enghien, was justly punished by the fate which he afterwards met with \u2014 not to mention his numerous and horrible executions in Madrid, the bare recollection of which appals my senses, \" And make the conduits of my blood freeze up.\" And yet, there are Englishmen, and English women too, to be found, who whine over the end of this sanguinary monster ! Finding that he had failed in two of his grandes pensees ; namely, the assent to the abdi cation on the part of Lewis the Eighteenth, and the arrest ofthe French princes, Buonaparte now set all his engines at work, to play on the cre dulity of the people of Italy. He caused a report to be circulated, that, being of Italian origin, he might, probably, be induced to renounce the"], [249, "233 MILAN Consulship of France, and take upon him the glory, after so many centuries of degradation, of regenerating that fine country, from the borders of France to Sicily, by forming it into one grand kingdom ; and this report, being in accordance with the ruse which he had played off on my excellent friend, the poor deceived Duke di Serbelloni, stirred up the hopes of the people almost to madness. The enthusiasm which prevailed in the north, as well as in the south of Italy, shewed,, that they were all chil dren of the same soil ; though millions of them had never felt the influence of the heat of Vesuvius or of Etna. They were electrified at the bare thought of becoming one entire nation, after they had been, for centuries, groaning under the yoke of so many princes and sove reigns ; by whom, from motives of a political nature, arising out of their soil, their strength, and their desirable situation, they had been kept in a state of perpetual variance with each other ; and, in consequence of which, they have now amongst them, nearly as many dialects as there are cities ; though the nobility and men of let ters all speak good Italian. Engines, of every description, were put in motion, for the purpose of promulgating the mighty man's new projects. Pensions were"], [250, "234 MILAN offered to one class, who were to be made Senators for life. The College of Electors were to be the sacred depository of the people's richts. The Senators were called the mono syllabic association : the College of Electors, the affirmative tribe. The lesson given to this notable body was, never to dispute among themselves, and only to answer as the bride does when the parson puts the wished-for question, \" Will you have this man to be your usband ?' ' The second order of these Orator Mums were directed to spare their lungs, and, by a sign of the head, like Mandarin figures, they were to bend themseves forward, in token of approbation of every individual whom Buo naparte might wish to have elected. For which good work, each member was to wear a cross of merit, and with it was to receive the very mo derate annual pension of thirty thousand franks ! As the wily Gloucester, when Buckingham had seduced the Mayor and Aldermen of Lon don to entreat the cruel hunch-back to take upon himself the sovereignty of the kingdom, craftily exclaimed, \" Alas, why should you heap these cares upon me ? I am unfit for state and majesty ; I do beseech you, take it not amiss ; I cannot, nor I will not, yield to you \" \u2014"], [251, "MILAN 235 so did the no less crafty Napoleon, when, poor man ! he was about to receive the heavy load of the imperial dignity, so much against his inclination, say, to those who intreated him thereto, \" Well, gentlemen, if you will have me take upon myself the immense charge of being the responsible head of the French go vernment, tye me down ! create a Senate to watch my proceedings !\" And, good heavens, what a Senate it was! Why, it was the very rump parliament of the renowned Praise-God-Barebones, who occupied themselves all day long in seeking the Lord, as earnestly as Cromwell, their master, occupied himself in seeking the Devil ! Certain it is, that Napoleon imitated the regicide hypocrite in all his operations ; except in his laudable economy of the public money ; for, to the no torious Fouche were intrusted millions, for the purpose of seducing the wretched inhabitants of the faubourgs of Paris, to assist in the erection of his usurped power. Titles, and pensions, and decorations, were also to be lavished on the army. Emoluments were to be bestowed on the literati, and on the civil magistrates.

For, though he had already declared him his heir, he nevertheless, on the birth of his brother Lewis's son, as easily revoked his pro mise, in favour of the child, whose father, when King of Holland, from the same ambitious mo tives, fell under the weight of a mere French crown ; which crown, however, Louis after wards honourably renounced his claim to, rather than wound his own conscience, by injuring the interests of his subjects, to satisfy the ca price and the cruelty of his brother Napoleon. The city of Genoa was flattered with Napo leon's especial protection. Having discovered, that many of the ancient families of that city had been formerly allied to the Buonaparte family, he \" willed, ordered, commanded, and insisted,\" that their government should forthwith be revolutionized : and, for giving them a pre tended free institution, he made them come down handsomely ; for, what between the ves sels which the English took from them by sea, and the plunderings of the French by land, the Genoese were reduced almost to a state of nudity. Having lost the ancient spirit of the"], [253, "M I L A N. 237 Dorias, they accepted, with the bayonet at their throats, the short-lived, buffoon Ligurian republic. Having, like a skilful physician, a plaister for every sore, Buonaparte made the Genoese believe, that he would restore their navy to its pristine greatness ; that he would build them new arsenals and docks for fresh fleets; and that he would render them, from their situation, the dread of the English, by furnishing them with a fleet which should cruize from Genoa up to Gibraltar. Nothing could flatter the vanity ofthe Genoese so much, as the idea of again be coming a respectable maritime power ; and, in nothing were Buonaparte's great abilities more conspicuous, than in the pains which he uni formly took to accomplish his end, by flattering the weak side of all those whom he had de termined to make his dupes and his slaves. But, all these man\u0153vres were necessary to the attainment of that imperial authority which now became the object of \" His daily longing, and his dream by night ;\" And, from the debased condition to which the people of Italy had been reduced, by a series of plunderings and dilapidations, can it be matter of surprise, that their minds should have"], [254, "238 MILAN become debased ; that their feelings should have been deadened to their best interests ; and that they only looked forward to the readiest means of freeing themselves from a state of perpetual uncertainty, agitation, and convulsion ? And, such was the precise situation of Italy, when the project for the restoration of mo narchy began to be warmly embraced by all ranks of the people of that distressed country. That tranquillity, and that peace of mind, to which they had so long been strangers, but which Buonaparte now flattered them with the possession of, and which really had all the appearance of being within reach, lulled them into a luxuriant dream of coming prosperity ; whereby they were induced credulously to pro mote all Buonaparte's projects of ambition, to their own future enslavement, as well as bit ter remorse, at having, at the expense of the political independence of their native land, reared the first steps of his tyrannical usurp ation. Napoleon's next grand operation was the bringing about the re-establishment of the Ca tholic religion in Paris, at a period when it was almost dangerous for a citizen to be seen with a common-prayer book ; but, without the ac complishment of this object, never could he"], [255, "239 MILAN. have succeeded in placing the imperial diadem on his head ; for, certain it is, that the intrigues of the French clergy had a considerable share in establishing him on the throne of the Bour bons, regardless of the rights of the legitimate heir ; though Lewis the Sixteenth had suffered on the scaffold in the support of their cause ! The better to secure the success of this pro ject, the same Archbishop of Aix, who had officiated at Rheims at the coronation of the unfortunate Lewis, was applied to. The pro found policy discoverable in these workings of the Corsican's brain is alone equalled by the effects which they produced. The ambassadors chosen on this occasion were Cambaceres and Le Brun ; the object of Napoleon being to destroy these two worthies in the estima tion both of the republicans and of the roy alists ; as it was equally so to ruin the said Archbishop in the universal opinion of all Europe. Like all his other plans, this too com pletely succeeded ; the parties consenting to become the dupes and the slaves of its wily projector. Now was arrived the time for proclaiming the concordat of his holiness the Pope. Ac cordingly, on the Easter Sunday following, Buo naparte went in state to the Metropolitan"], [256, "240 MILAN Church of Notre Dame, in one of the carriages belonging to the murdered King of France, drawn by six horses, accompanied by the Bi shops and by an army of thirty thousand men, there to reestablish the true Catholic faith, with all the \"pride, pomp, and circumstance \" of royalty, excepting in the article of liveries. He, however, insisted, that the servants of Cam baceres and Le Brun should be so habited, in suits of the richest description ; for the purpose of trying how far the Parisians were likely to relish the restoration of the old order of things ; to see whether or not he subjected himself to danger, or to ridicule ; and, if there should be any, that it might fall on the shoulders of the above right worthy couple, whom he longed to precipitate from the seat of government : for Napoleon, like his brother Turk, was unable to \" bear a rival near the throne.\" The experiment exceeded the cunning pro jector's most sanguine expectation ; and, to say the truth, the sight altogether was one of the most imposing scenes that was ever exhibited. Indeed, it beggars all description, and was cer tainly, of all Buonaparte's triumphal entries into Paris, the triumphal entry par excellence. No fewer than eighty thousand troops lined the streets of the city. The Mameluke soldiers,"], [257, "241 1I1LA N. two and two, were seen leading a horse each, bedizened out in the richest Asiatic trappings, the saddles and saddle-cloths being covered with gold and precious stones. The whole, in short, having more the appearance of eastern pageantry, than a republican procession headed by its de mocratic first ruler. In a morning or two after this splendid pro cession, an article appeared in the official paper, the Moniteur, for the purpose of being circu lated throughout France. It began by stating, that \" it could not be denied, that Paris abound ed in persons possessing the most lively imagi nations ; that it had been strongly urged by such persons, how much it would be for the be nefit of France and of all Europe, and how greatly it would contribute to the establishment of universal tranquillity, if Buonaparte could but be induced to take upon himself the sovereign au thority, with a title suitable to the dignity of so renowned a nation. ' What do you think of king?' said one. ' O, no,' replied another, 1 that's a name odious to the ears of Frenchmen.' ' Well,' said a third, ' what think you of em peror? I wish, with all my heart, that such a proposition was not death by the law !' ' O !' continued a fourth, ' but our Buonaparte is too merciful and too generous to order its execution VOL. II.

' Be sides,' added a fifth, ' he was himself one of those who caused this decree to be issued ; and surely, as Charlemagne, in many instances, made and unmade laws at his discretion, the great Napoleon may be allowed the same pri vilege.' \" This trumped-up dialogue was immediately copied into all the other newspapers, and every succeeding day produced a fresh article in favour of monarchy. By devices like these did the son of the pettifogging attorney of Ajaccio, feel the pulse of the people of France, as to the degree of safety with which he might ascend the imperial ladder ! And, by such means did he \" Court that greatness which did overwhelm him !\""], [259, "243 CHAPTER XX. MILAN. THE BUONAPARTE FAMILY IN THE MILANESE TERRITORY.

Buonaparte's court now adopted a new style of addressing those around them. The family put on a sort of condescending benignity of man ners, and strove to recommend themselves by their charities, and their beneficent attentions to all ranks and classes ; until at last, nothing was actually talked of, but the astonishing mild ness of manners of the whole family, and the calm and implicit submission of Buonaparte himself to the will of the nation. b, 2"], [260, "244 JI 1 L AN. And at this time it was, that he first ordered his secret emissaries to sound the Pope, as to his coronation ; for if he had found the old man un willing to take a journey to Paris, he had deter mined to have imitated the example of Charle magne, by going to Rome to be crowned ; though that was not precisely what he wished, as he was desirous of degrading and humbling the Pope, rather than of exalting him ; though he had chosen the conduct of the above sovereign as the model to go by. Having mentioned the great man who, in the year 800, became emperor of the west by right of conquest, I must here be allowed to relate a short anecdote. In the cathedral at Aix-la- Chapelle there is deposited, among other curio sities, a cameo of an onyx, about the size of a crown-piece, on which is a likeness, in basso relievo, of the son of Charlemagne, which really resembles Buonaparte, as much as if it had been intended for him, and far more than many ofthe portraits which he has himself sat for to Andrea Appiani, of Milan, who has painted him, at his own request, in all the striking stages of his career, and in all his imperial costumes. This cameo, when he was at Aix-la-Chapelle, Buona parte had copied ; and that copy was the identi cal medallion which he wore as the real likeness"], [261, "245 M 1 L A N. of Charlemagne. But that, however, was not the fact, as the original is still to be seen in that chapel ; where the story was told to me by one of the keepers of the antiques. It must now be nearly a thousand years since it was executed. This cameo, on his arrival at Dresden, Buona parte shewed as the head of Charlemagne. He told the Saxons, that in the yrear 803, they had submitted to his likeness, exhibiting it from his neck, around which it was suspended by way of triumph ; as Charlemagne had behaved to wards the people of Saxony with excessive cruelty. This Buonaparte did, in revenge for the insults they had offered to Lavalette, who had been his democratical ambassador, and for the little respect they had paid him, previous to his being made emperor of France, and raising the Electorate into a kingdom. Ludovico Wide mann, a Venetian nobleman who died in Russia, assured me he was present when this conversa tion took place at Pilnitz, the country residence of the king of Saxony ; as did also Alvise Mo cenigo, who was charged with the mission to the Pope, the anecdote respecting the coro nation. But, to return to my narrative. Paris was now made to resound with the noble sacrifices, the warlike achievements, the political acquire- r 3"], [262, "246 MILAN ments of the great Napoleon, and the pitch of glory to which he had elevated France, from the depth of anarchy in which he had found her, when he took the reins of government out of the feeble hands of the Directory. \" The con quest of Italy, the submission ofthe greatest part of Germany, the subjugation of the Swiss, the success in Egypt, the union of Holland, the ag grandizement of France, and the amazing ad vantages that would accrue to her from his having made the Rhine her boundaries, and thereby aggregated so many millions of subjects to that nation, added to the prosperous condition in which she then was \u2014 all these things demanded a striking act of gratitude on the part of the people, towards the godlike man who had been the cause of these numberless ad vantages.\" Such were the matters that were every day trumpetted forth in all the newspapers of Paris, and of which Lavalette was one of the prime propagators. The Palais Royal, too, had its orators. Speeches of the most fulsome description were delivered, and portions of them were indus triously circulated all over France, prior to the phosphoric matter being communicated from the north to the south of Italy. Added to this, by the flattering attentions which were now so"], [263, "247 MILAN. exuberantly lavished on the ministers of the dif ferent sovereigns, for their tame acquiescence in what was going on, all of them were credulously induced to assist in elevating to a throne, a man who was secretly planning the destruction and overthrow of every sovereign in Europe, to make way for his own mushroom family of kings and princes. In the mean time, the marriage took place be tween Hortensia Beauharnois and Napoleon's brother, Louis. A crown was to be the reward of their mutual compliance ; as it is well known that inclination, on either side, had nothing to do with their union, and that both the parties sacrificed themselves to state policy. Hortensia Beauharnois was the daughter of Josephine. She is a most accomplished and well-educated female : she sings and plays with much taste, feeling, and science ; has an excel lent heart, and a very considerable portion of good sense. She is kind, benevolent, charitable, unassuming, and affable to all who approach her ; and, from her good understanding and natural disposition to kind actions in private life \u2014 united to' the same good intentions on the part of her husband \u2014 they would have succeeded in making themselves respected and beloved in Holland, had they been inde- r 4"], [264, "248 Jl I L A N. pendent sovereigns ; but it was impossible for them to do those things for the good of their subjects, which the dictates of their hearts pointed out to them ; surrounded, as they were, by the spies of Napoleon, who reported to him every one of their actions ; until at last, finding that they were not suffered to do any thing for the benefit of the population entrusted to their charge, like faithful stewards, they yielded up the trust confided to them. They are both living retired, as the duke and duchess of St. Lu ; the former at Rome, the latter at Augs burgh, a city belonging to the king of Bavaria, whose daughter was married to Hortensia's brother, the worthy prince Eugene ; who, to the regret of all who knew him, has recently paid the debt of nature. As the duke of Wurtzburgh (late of Tuscany) did not think fit to leave his German dominions, to pay his court to the new king-maker at Paris, as all the rest had done before him, he was struck off me list ; and, in order to keep him in subjection, was told, that as Napoleon had de clared himself king of Italy, it would be dero gatory in him to give up any portion of it ; but that the duke might propose himself for the res toration of Poland, and that he should be sup-"], [265, "249 M I L A N. ported in his claims to that kingdom ; which would be given to him as an indemnity for the loss of his German states. Tuscany was not mentioned, though (the king of Etruria being dead) the first of his new made queens was still seated on its throne. She, however, in a very short time, without any other reason but the will and pleasure of Napoleon, was dethroned ; and Murat, as a fit instrument for the deliberate execution of all sort of crimes, was commanded to execute the order, and to conduct her majesty and her son to Milan ; whence they proceeded to Spain. Previous to this event, Lucca had undergone the same fate as the other sister Republics, in be half of Napoleon's sister, Madame Eliza Bacci ochi, the wife ofthe ci-devant marker at a com mon billiard table. Madame Campan, formerly one of the at tendants on the unfortunate Marie- Antoinette, was now sent for to instruct the imperial family in prospectu, and the nobility, about to be cre ated, how to walk, how to look, how to speak in demi accents, so as scarcely to be understood, except by an inclination of the head, or the gra cious smile which was the characteristic of that amiable queen. Nay, even the unfortunate waddle of Louis the Sixteenth, was to be intro-"], [266, "250 MILAN duced, as one of the appendages of former times, and the better to enable them to put on the airs of frivolous, light-headed courtiers. Courtesies, too, were industriously practised by the females ; and they were taught how they were to retire from the imperial court, without offending any of the newly-manufactured prin ces, by turning their imperial derrieres upon them on leaving the court. The chief of the court attendants were in- structed how they were to listen to the persons presenting memorials to them, as well as to the more fortunate mortals who were to be presented Xto the poientissimo and augustissimo Napoleon Buonaparte \u2014 the titles which he assumed on being proclaimed emperor. While this drilling work was going on, some of the most ludicrous scenes that can possibly be imagined, were constantly taking place, be tween these washer-women duchesses in petto, and their equally dignified dukes of husbands. The ladies, when attired in their costly state dresses, forgetting they were not going to the wash-tub, would, every now and then, tuck up the sleeves of their gowns, the better to enable them to withdraw from the room backwards. Innumerable were the bruises they were doomed to suffer from stumbling over their trains ; and"], [267, "MILAN, 251 many a \" sacre !\" did they rap out, before they became perfect in the court exercise. The Christian name, \" Napoleon,\" which had scarcely been heard of before, was now substituted instead of that of General Buona parte, by which he was only known, at least to the Parisians. The baptismals of the whole family were likewise used instead of their surnames. The females dropped the word \" citoyenne,\" for that of \" madame ;\" and no thing was now heard of but Madame Josephine, and Letitia, and Elise, and Stephanie ; and Mon sieur Joseph, Louis, Lucien, Jerome, Eugene ; and Mademoiselle Hortense, &c. &c. While these scenes were going on, the courts of Prussia, Bavaria, Baden, Wurtemburgh, Saxony, and Mecklenburgh Strelitz, were all rewarded with large slices of territory, for the countenance they were affording to the new imperial system. Entirely new maps were ordered to be made out for the said territories. England was to be deprived of all her possessions in Germany. Hanover was to be given to Prussia, with Bre men ; and Saxony, Hesse-Cassel, Erfurth, and Weimer, were to be erected into a kingdom, and given to the Elector, together with the title of king."], [268, "252 MILAN Bavaria was to have Salzburgh, Passau, Augsburg, Bayreuth and Anspach, and was also to be raised into a kingdom, with the Elector at its head. The Elector of Baden was to have Manheim and Hanau, and to be made a grand duke. Wurtemberg was to have Aschaffenburg, Constanz, Lindau, and other arrondissemens, to add to the dignity of a newly-manufactured kingdom. The Duke of Mecklenburgh-Schwerin was to have Stralsund, Lubeck, and Gluckstadt, and be made a grand duke. Spain was to have Portugal ; and the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Lucca and the Isle of Elba, with Massa and Carara. To his holiness the Pope was promised the restitution of the ancient Roman legations, Be nevento, Ponte Corvo, and some other places on the frontier, between Naples and Rome. All the German princes were obliged to enter into private engagements, to ally themselves with Napoleon, for the purpose of strengthening a German confederacy against Austria and Russia. It is said, that Russia, at that time, refused any aggrandizement in Poland, which could only be effected by the spoliation of Prussia or Austria. Turkey, the grand war horse of Catherine, was also held out ; but the immense force which the English kept up in the"], [269, "MILAN 253 Baltic, with the example of Denmark, and the feebleness of Sweden, were, it is said, the reasons why the Emperor of Russia would not, at that moment, accede to any of Napoleon's propositions ; though he afterwards united with him in all his continental schemes for the de struction of this country. Jerome Buonaparte was at that time in Ame rica, and married to the rich and beautiful Miss Pattison. A vessel was therefore imme diately dispatched, with directions for him to return to Europe and abandon his wife, as, byr the German alliance, another had been fixed upon for him. In the meantime, Napoleon was proclaimed Emperor of France, and caused himself to be crowned King of Italy. There were now five imperial princes, and the like number of imperial princesses, to be provided for. This, however, could not be accomplished without the spolia tion of his former protegee, Spain : and, so completely did Buonaparte succeed in hoaxing the old queen of that country, that he gained her over to all his plans, on the mere rumour that it was his intention to restore monarchy in France ; fancying foolishly that he was labour ing for the restoration of the Bourbons. So totally duped were the King and the Prince of"], [270, "254 MILAN. Peace, that they sent an extraordinary courier from La Gran ca to the Tuilleries, to thank him for his confidence, and promising to assist him in his undertaking ; never suspecting, that he was all this time acting the hypocrite, or that it was his intention to play the first character in the farce he was getting up. Buonaparte flattered the Prince of Peace with the notion, that he intended to make him a so vereign prince, at the very moment that he was treacherously encouraging these sovereigns and their prime minister to leave their native coun try : for it is a notorious fact, that neither the king nor queen would ever have consented to leave Madrid, but for the influence which this minister exercised over these feeble-minded princes. On this account, Spain was the most difficult soil the Corsican had to work upon ; as she had tacitly consented to all his views. To accomplish his ends, therefore, it became necessary, by means of private emissaries, to sow the seeds of disaffection in the heart ofthe court, by stirring up the son against the father, and, vice versd, the mother against the son, the hus band against the wife, and the son against her favourite, the Prince of Peace ; until their pri vate quarrels had led to their public overthrow, and furnished him with a pretext for taking the"], [271, "255 JI I L A N. whole of them prisoners, and for removing his brother Joseph from the throne of Naples and creating him King of Spain. Napoleon's next step was to give Naples to his sister Caroline and her husband Murat; and, from the depraved and tyrannical con duct of Joseph, during his short-lived reign, and the still more tyrannical conduct of his infamous minister, Salicetti, if Murat had avoided the violence to which he was com pelled by Napoleon to resort, he would have attached the people of Naples to his person and government ; as he had already done at Berg, and from which dukedom he was removed by Napoleon's jealousy, at finding that he was be coming too popular. Naples was always in tended for Lucien ; but, in consequence of his not consenting to divorce his wife, as Jerome had done, Napoleon determined to place Murat on the throne of that kingdom ; to the great dis gust and disappointment of Josephine, who wished her son Eugene to be appointed to the office, in order that he might be somewhat less dependent upon her husband : and, out of this arose the settled rancour that ever after subsist ed between Eugene and Murat ; for there is little doubt, that had the latter succeeded in his mad project of conquering the north of Italy, he would have shown thc former no mercy."], [272, "256 JI I L A N . Holland, also, was now to change its system, and to be erected into a kingdom, with Louis Buonaparte, as I have before observed, at its head. Schimmelpenninck, who was at that time the governor, was by no means a fit person to fill the situation to which Napoleon had ap pointed him ; his principles being good, and he being a real lover of his native country, and anxious to cultivate a friendly commercial con nexion with England, he sacrificed his own pri vate interest, in endeavouring to promote that object. Augereau then commanded the French troops, and Simonville was the ambassador. I was acquainted with him in Italy, in the year 1792, when he was arrested by Pozzi, an agent of Austria, and sent prisoner to Mantua, where I had an opportunity of rendering him some essential services. In the year 1803, being with my husband and the late Count Zenobio, at the theatre at the Hague, Simonville recog nized me for an old acquaintance, but not with \" a new face ;\" for he behaved towards us with the utmost cordiality and politeness, and gave us a general invitation to his table, and to his box at the theatre. The whole three were re moved from Holland, to make room for men better suited to Napoleon's new order of things.

Jerome Buonaparte having, by this time, re turned from America, his marriage with the Princess of Wurtemburgh was solemnized, though much, it is said, against the inclination of the bridegroom ; but, such a charm is there in crowns and kingdoms, that they soon get the better of every virtuous scruple ! A beautiful wife, a beloved child, and a quiet conscience \u2014 what are they but feathers, when thrown into the scale of restless ambition ! The King of Prussia was next to be sacrificed, and to be made to disgorge, in a tenfold degree, the millions he had received from the French Directory, for his disgraceful neutrality, and his ready consent to the taking of Hanover from the English. In his turn, he was now to lose a considerable portion of his hereditary do minions ; for, more than the Great Frederick had gained during the Seven Yea/s war, was his unfortunate grand nephew made to give up in"], [275, "259 -VI I I.

O ! if the old warrior could look up from his tomb, and see that Saxony which he had so cruelly insulted, possessed of his Brandenburgh dominions, how would his haughty spirit haunt the agents of this misguided policy ! But, forgetful of the \" hodie mihi, eras tibi,\" Prussia fatally laughed at the downfall of Austria, and Austria laughed at the downfall of Prussia \u2014 until, by their own folly, both the one and the other had fairly been laughed out of house and home ! The kingdom of Westphalia was already des tined for the newly-married couple, and the battle of Jena decided the grand question in favour of the candidates. Hanover, Brunswick Lunenburg, Osnaburg, Bremen, Hesse-Cassel, and two-thirds of the hereditary Prussian domi nions, were now to be united, under the title of the kingdom of Westphalia. The word \" Land grave\" was to be dropped for the future ; and the Tom Thumb of a King, Jerome, was or dered to take up his residence in the ancient palace of the said prince at Cassel. The democratical government of France, which was in existence at the time of the pur chase of the King of Prussia's neutrality, not having then the money wherewith to make good the said purchase, actually sent to Berlin s 2"], [276, "260 M I L A N the crown-jewels of the late King of France, as a pledge for the fulfilment of the stipulation. After the fatal defeat of the Duke of Brunswick, and the still more memorable battle of Jena, Buonaparte, on his arrival at Berlin, insisted on their being instantly given up to him ; together with the millions which the King of Prussia had received from the French Directory, for the aforesaid neutrality. His beautiful queen too, became the object of Buonaparte's rage and ab horrence. He calumniated and ridiculed her, for her virtuous affection for, and attentions to, the king her husband. Her severe losses, added to the ruin of Mecklenburgh-Strelitz, her native country, preyed so severely on her mind, that they soon brought this much-regretted princess to an untimely grave ! Anspach and Bayreuth were now given to the King of Bavaria, with Inspruck and the Tyrol ; and, as a further stimulus to the king's consent to the marriage of his eldest daughter with Eugene Beauharnois, Augsburg was also thrown in. Napoleon and Josephine, with the whole of their suite, were at Munich, when the ceremony took place. The King of Bavaria re ceived this great addition to his territory, in the way of reward, for having deserted the Emperor of Austria, as head ofthe German empire, and"], [277, "261 M I L A N. leagued himself with Napoleon, the common enemy of all Germany. The Duke of Baden was next called on to fulfil his part of the stipulation ; and a niece of Josephine, who had once lived with the French general, Boyer, was ushered into the world, under the title of the Princess Stephanie Napo leone, and married to the above prince, who was created grand duke. This prince came to a premature death ; leaving behind him no male heirs to blush at the origin of their father's dukedom\u2014 the murder ofthe Duke d'Enghien! Another of Josephine's nieces, a Mademoi selle Tascher, was also lugged into the new im perial Napoleon dynasty, and married at Brussels to the young Duke d'Aremberg ; whom, how ever, she soon left, and went to reside at Paris. Pauline, who had been married to her second husband, the Prince Camillo Borghese, was also placed as governess over the people of Turin. All the imperial brothers, and sisters, and nieces, being thus provided for, protisoiremeht \u2014 for not a soul of them were allowed to have a will of their own\u2014 it now became necessary to do something for the parent stock, as well as for her worthy brother, the citizen Fesch ; who, though bred a priest, had become a commissaire de guerre, and had been living by gambling at s 3"], [278, "262 JI I L A N. Paris. Accordingly, the former received the dignified appellation of Madame Letitia Napo leone, Dame de France ; while the latter was made Archbishop of Lyons, and a cardinal, \" par la grace de Dieu !\" Family matters being thus settled, the next necessary step for the support of the imperial government, was the erection of an aristocracy ; without which, Napoleon well knew no monar chy could long stand. It was not, however, to be an aristocracy, whose duty it would be to hold the balance between the sovereign and the people, but an aristocracy who were ready, at all hazards, to uphold his power, upon the same arbitrary basis on which he had founded his im perial authority. For this purpose, it became ne cessary, that the majority of it should be chosen from out of the class to which he himself belong ed ; namely, the military. He came, therefore, to the determination, that all his generals should be made marshals, and that all his marshals should (with scarcely an exception) be dubbed dukes and peers of France. The order of merit was also created, as a de coration, and many of the second and third ranks of the military, and even private soldiers, were presented therewith.

And now, to crown the whole, and to raise Napoleon Le Grand to the acme of his wishes, Maria Louisa was safely delivered of a son, and all Paris were thereupon directed to sing \u2014 \" Unto us a son is born ; unto us a child is given !\" And, \" O ! miseras hominum mentes, oh pectora c\u00e6ca !\" even the colour of the \" caca du petit Roi de Rome,\" became the vogue at the imperial court : the looms at Lyons were instantly set in motion ; and nothing was to be seen in the Parisian beau-monde, but this most predominant of all colours \u2014 an instance this of frivolity and of folly that, perhaps, was never surpassed, even by that giddiest of all giddy nations ! The title given to this \" altera spes Rom\u0153,\" sufficiently accounts for the hasty kidnapping of the old Pope, of which I have already given a faithful account; for it would have been de rogatory to the dignity of the newly-born babe, s 4"], [280, "264 MILAN. to have borne the title of \" King of Rome,\" while the legitimate sovereign of that city, was still in the exercise of his lawful authority. Never was man in a greater bustle than Na poleon was on the birth of his son ! All the emperors, and kings, and princes, were solicited tu become his sponsors : all the names in the calendar were to be his : all the bishops and the archbishops were to exhaust heaven in offering up prayers for the preservation of the wonderful child of so wonderful a man, the fruit of so won derful a marriage with so wonderful a house ! Indeed, such a call was there for every thing wonderful, that wonders themselves became lost in the clouds of sublime wonders, per formed in the wonderful \u00e6ra of the Great Em peror Napoleon and the Little King of Rome ! But, the most wonderful of all these wonders, was, that the said Great Man should have forgotten himself so wonderfully, as to have proclaimed this wonderful son \u2014 coming into the world with his head foremost, and with all his natural fa* culties about him \u2014 the king of a mere city, instead of the sovereign of a whole nation ! The children who happened to be born on this dies faustus, whether male or female, were all to be named after Napoleon.

Now, the people of Italy are not accustomed"], [284, "268 GENOA to the pai'ch, or knout; and no French or Italian officer had ever ventured so far to degrade them, as to use the cane, or bastinado. For the people of Italy are as opposite in character and in sentiments, from those of the north, as sterile Lapland and uncultivated Siberia are to their own voluptuous climate, and its delicious and luxurious productions. The Genoese territory extends around the gulph of that name, to Port Venere, on the east, to the little principality of Monaco, which formerly belonged to the Princess who accompanied the Prince of Conde in all his tra vels, during his absence from Chantilly, after the breakiug out of the French Revolution. On the west, and in its rear, are the Imperial fiefs, which have been the cause of so much bloodshed. Not a braver race of men than the Genoese, are to be found on the continent. To render them equal to any in Europe, nothing is wanted but a virtuous and an uncorrupt go vernment. They are admirable seamen, and remarkable for their unconquerable aversion to the Austrians and the Piedmontese : but, like the Venetians, they have been most infamously sold to this their most inveterate enemy. The experience of centuries has sufficiently proved, that, though the native Genoese love of liberty and independence may, for a time, be stifled"], [285, "269 G E NO A and borne down, it will ultimately burst forth with renewed energy, to the dismay and expulsion of their cruel enemy ; as it did in the case of the aforesaid Marshal and his mercenary forces. They have too much of the Corsican character in them, to yield up tamely, and without a struggle, the blessings which were enjoyed by them for cen turies. To suppose that they will not one day make an effort to shake off their detestable fet ters, would be to libel the whole Genoese nation. Let their task-masters, then, look to themselves! For I can tell them, that the Genoese are, with the single exception of the people of Corsica, the most crafty, as well as the most revengeful, people on the face of the earth. The victory obtained by them over Botta and the Austrian army, is narrated by them to their children, and is handed down from father to son. Like that of the Vespere Siciliane, it is ever in their mouths, to inspire the rising generation to valour, and to impress on their minds the great things their forefathers have accomplished, in the sacred cause of liberty and independence. It is customary for the other natives of Italy to say, that it requires five cunning Christians to outwit one Jew, but that to outwit a Genoese, requires a score of Jews ; and, to say the truth,"], [286, "270 GENOA the extraordinary arts they had recourse to, during the protracted wars carried on by them against the Venetians, fully justify the as sertion. Generally speaking, the ladies of Genoa are remarkably handsome. To which I may add, that they are elegant in their dress, and resem ble, more than any other females in Italy, those who may be considered the beauties of the world \u2014 I mean my countrywomen, the ladies of England \u2014 except in their passion for coquetry. Next to Naples, the situation of Genoa, when looked at in a boat from the bav, is the most enchanting of any in all Italy ; and perhaps in all Europe. The picturesque appearance of the delightful lemon, orange, palm, and other choice fruit trees, intermixed with views of the fortifi cations, topped with the majestic mountains of the Bocchetta, Campo Marone, and Campo San Pietro, all at once under the eye of the spec tator, are foremost among the wonders of na ture and art, and, like the beautiful scenes to be met with in Tuscany, present the appearance of an amphitheatre, headed by an immense pile of magnificent marble buildings. Like Venice, the city of Genoa is grand be yond description, and impresses the beholder with a conviction, of the immense wealth which"], [287, "GENOA 271 these two republics had once collected together. Rich beyond any other country, and great and powerful, as England now is, nothing can be more evident than the simple fact, that her un travelled inhabitants can form no just concep tion of the immense riches which these two states must, at one time, have contained. No thing on earth, in my humble opinion, is so well calculated to correct the purse-proud vanity of some of my countrymen, as a short trip to the several places of which I have spoken ; but, above all, to Venezia la Ricca, and Genova la Superba. The port of Genoa, once the emporium of the world, is now as much deserted as if it were infected with the plague. Such, alas ! are the blessings which result from tacking the people of a free republic, to the tail of an abso lute monarchy ! \u2014 a junction as unnatural as that of the horse with the ass, and from which no issue can be expected, but a vicious, refrac tory animal, which it is impossible to break in, and which oftentimes succeeds in upsetting and damaging its keeper.

From a total want of that permanent legislative justice, which can alone secure to the cultivator, the fruits of his industry, a complete stagnation has taken place in every branch of commercial speculation. The inevitable consequences of such a system have been discontent and misery, and utter ruin to its once rich and flourishing inhabitants. The trade of Genoa was at one time so ge neral in every article of commerce, in conse quence of her being unconnected with any continental power, and a free port, that I shall confine myself to pointing out the commerce peculiarly belonging to the soil and the manu factures of Genoa. It consists, then, of oils, pastes, and macaroni of all kinds ; of sweet meats, candied fruits, sugar-plums, mushrooms, fresh and dried ; and of the richest and stoutest silk-velvets in all Europe. During carnival time there is a good opera at Genoa ; but the inhabitants are of too plod ding a disposition, and are too much taken up in matters connected with cent, per cent., to pay any remarkable attention to the fine arts ; which are less cultivated and encouraged in that city, than in any other part of Italy. The present race of Genoese are so interested, that they"], [289, "GENOA 273 would rather have a pair of antlers clapped on their brows, than lose the lading of a cargo, or the unlading of a vessel when it comes into port ; when the struggle with every one is, who shall be before-hand with his neighbour. Such have been the blessed effects of the union of Genoa to Piedmont! and such will they continue to be, as long as a once free na tion shall be suffered to be thus excluded from the enjoyment of its legitimate authority, for the purpose of being made the foot-stool of ab solute and despotic power ! Now, if legitimacy is to be respected ; if, among monarchical governments, there can be no tranquillity without it ; and if, in conse quence, the sovereigns of Europe have entered into a Holy Alliance, for the purpose of esta blishing the principle ; why, let me ask, should not the legitimacy of republican governments be equally respected ? Have not those govern ments the same rights ? And, are they not as much the sacred depositories of the will of the people, as any monarch on earth can possibly be? The streets of Genoa are very narrow and eonfined, in the lower town ; and, in conse quence of its once immense population, the houses are of great height. The apartments, too, in general, are very lofty. Many ofthe rich vol. 11. t"], [290, "274 GENOA bankers and merchants reside in the one nearest to the heavens. But, the houses of the wealthy are absolutely palaces, consisting of numerous suites of rooms, most elegantly and richly fur nished. When Salicetti, the civil Massena of plunder, resided in Genoa, in all the pomp and splendour of an Asiatic monarch, under the disguise of a simple ambassador, he had one of these lodgings, \" next floor to the sky,\" fitted up in the most splendid style, in which he constantly gave the most sumptuous entertainments. This impu dent upstart caused an English lady to be dis charged from the Opera, because she would not sing at his private parties. The rich bankers, Emanuel Balbi, Gneco, and Andimini, were, in the year 1796, as I have already hinted, the persons who, at Salicetti's instigation, lent Buonaparte the sum of two hundred thousand livres, at the period of his first invading Italy ; without the loan of which sum he never could have commenced his Italian operations. In no small degree, therefore, have these bankers been the cause of the ruin of their country ; and therefore are they as much de tested throughout Italy, for their infernal trea chery, as the good Venetians are commiserated"], [291, "275 GENOA for having been basely betrayed by the Smith field forestaller of nations. I regard, however, the smiles of these wretches, as little as I deprecate their frowns. Gold I know to be their god. I shall therefore ever speak of such creatures as Balbi, in the manner that their foul deeds merit. As I would gladly praise their virtues, if they had any, so will I ever expose and hold up to detestation, their vices ; knowing, as I well do, that those vices exist. But, above all, \" Dum nemor ipse mei, dum spiritus hoc regit artus,\" will I hold up to the horror of my virtuous countrymen, their execrable commerce in hu man flesh \u2014 a commerce which no man or wo man, with a drop of English blood in their veins, can ever hear of with calm indifference !

But why \u2014 in the name of hu manity and of justice \u2014 why hast thou not been able to find a small corner in thy philanthropic bosom, for the interesting inhabitants of \" the pleasant garden of fair Italy ?\" But, \" non omnia possumus omnes ?\" It is solely from the favourable position of Genoa, and her general importance to Europe, t 2"], [292, "276 GENOA in a commercial and political point of view, that I am anxious to see that city freed from conti nental connexion.

This country and Savoy were once looked upon as the impregnable barrier and safeguard of Italy, against foreign invasion. The Duke of Savoy is Prince of Piedmont, and, after the peace of 1745, assumed the title of King of Sardinia ; which title he received in return for Sicily ; the last-mentioned country having been, by the policy and wisdom of the late Hyde, Lord Clarendon, annexed, during his embassy, to the kingdom of Naples. The same able and excellent nobleman was the cause of the Low Countries being separated from French, as well as from Spanish influence, and given to the Empress, Maria Theresa of Austria. The wisdom of this deep-sighted policy has t 3"], [294, "278 P I E D JI O N T. been sufficiently manifested by the simple fact, that those countries continued in the undis turbed possession of the House of Austria, until the volcanic explosion, occasioned by the French revolution, subverted the equilibrium, which till then had existed between the civilized nations of Europe ; and it probably would be no exaggeration for me to add, that nearly three portions of the globe have felt the effects of its fatal influence. But, to return to my subject. At the last general peace, Austria was moderate and mo dest enough, to signify her determination to retain the possession of Piedmont ; under the ostensible plea, that the King of Sardinia was not sufficiently strong to prevent the future encroachments of the French \u2014 as if she herself had never been conquered by them ! England, however, with that native love of equity for which her sons are so distinguished, in order to maintain the even balance of power, sent her triumphant navy to Sardinia, to convey the sovereign of that country from his long in sular exile, and to place him, in open defiance of the wish of his imperial brother-in-law, on the throne of his continental dominions. The Piedmont territory, together with the Venetian states, form the northern boundary of"], [295, "PIEDMONT. 279 Italy, dividing Switzerland and Genoa from the Milanese. The Piedmontese are soldiers by nature, like the people of old France. None but the nobi lity were suffered to carry arms ; and nothing was esteemed so praise-worthy in the eyes of the men, or so captivating in those of the wo men, as the profession of war. A man who was seen without a sword, was a sort of noun ad jective in the vocabulary of the fashionable circles ; and though, perhaps, he could boast of nothing beyond a military commission in a ske leton regiment, that was a sufficient \" passe par-tout \" to the smiles and the good graces of his fair inamorata. From this, it is easy to imagine, what such a nation could have achieved, had it been gal lantly led on to the conflict and stimulated to lofty deeds by heroic examples, similar to those which the history of their own country afforded, during the glorious enterprises of the gallant Emanuel against foreign invaders ; for, if the sacred flame of liberty, which animated the breasts of the Piedmontese patriots, and which induced them to endeavour to save their sove reign and their countrymen from the disgrace of submitting to a foreign yoke, had not been r 4"], [296, "280 PIEDMONT. betrayed, the deliverance of Piedmont would have been secured. But, alas ! instead of this, in the very heat of action, these brave men were basely abandoned by the very individual, who, of all others, should have protected and stood by them to the last ! Most shamefully did he take to flight, and hand over his bravest subjects, as rebels, to the mer ciless vengeance of a foreign assailant. How often, under similar cruel circumstances, have those gallantpatriots, who have been ready to de fend their native country to the last, been loaded with ignominy ; and the remorseless intruders upon their soil, held up to the world as con querors and as heroes ! Such may be the worldly policy of crowned heads ; but, by the commission of such deeds, they must never ex pect to stand approved in the sight of Him \" who wears the crown immortally.\" The language spoken by the lower sort of Piedmontese is neither Italian nor French, but a corrupt dialect, which can only be under stood among themselves. Turin, the capital of Piedmont, is entered by the fine straight road, shaded by a double row of lofty trees, leading from one of the king's country seats, called Rivoli, through the Porta Susina, to the fine street called La Dora Grossa."], [297, "281 PIEDMONT. Turin, which is a most interesting city, has been less noticed by travellers than any of the other cities of Italy ; probably, because it hap pens to be either the first at which they enter, or the last at which they depart, from the gar den of Europe. In the former case, they are generally too anxious to proceed to the south, and in the latter, are so satiated with what they have already beheld, that they rarely afford themselves time to appreciate its merits. Turin, however, is certainly equal to any in land town of Italy. Its beautiful arcades, the Strada del Po, the regal palace, the delightful view of the church of the Superga, rising above all the rest, amidst an amphitheatre of vine covered hills, and the windings of the classic Po, altogether present a most magnificent picture. Turin is the most regular built city in all Italy, and is embellished with a bridge, thrown by the French over the Po, and allowed to be a most exquisite piece of architecture. Then there are the two principal squares, the Piazza San Carlo, and the Piazza del Castello, both ornamented with splendid porticos, which form the promenade ofthe nobility, and are filled with elegant coffee-houses, inns, and shops of restau rateurs. On crossing the bridge of the Po, are beheld, on the south, the fertile plains of Saluzzo, abound."], [298, "282 PIEDMONT. ing with beautiful gardens and groves, and rich lands, ascending all the way up to the convent ofthe Madonna del Monte; from the terrace of which may be had a complete view of all I have been describing. The city of Turin is laid down on a fine grass plat, like a map. It is of no great ex tent, but it is neat, elegant, and excessively cleanly, the streets being washed every day ; and all the surrounding country is in a state of the highest cultivation. There are two very good theatres at Turin. The smallest is called the Teatro di Carignano, and is opposite to the palace of that name ; the other the Gran Teatro, which is a most beau tiful building, but it is not open, except during carnival season. The church music of the high mass is per formed in a most perfect manner ; but the style differs greatly from that of the sacred music in this country. The beautiful church of the Superga, which is situated at a distance of five miles from the city, was built by Victor Ama deus, in commemoration of the battle won by the famous Prince Eugene over the French. Formerly, the Grand Opera was kept open at the expense of the court ; when it was the uniform practice to present every performer nightly with a new pair of white gloves, and"], [299, "283 PIEDMONT. all necessary refreshments. The precise time which the music and ballet were to occupy was minuted ; that the performance might termi nate at a fixed hour, in order that the morning's devotion of the court might not be broken in upon by the amusements of the preceding night. The court of Turin was at one time the most brilliant in all Italy, and in etiquette and dress was the complete model of that of France. Now-a-days, the ladies dress more in the English fashion. They are well made, and have fair complexions and good features ; though not quite so regular as those of the ladies of Genoa, or Sienna. They are, however, exceedingly de licate, and possess a peculiarly interesting soft ness of manners. The men are taller, and of a fairer com plexion, than the rest of the Italians. In the valleys of the Alps, both sexes, but more espe cially the women, have large goitres, which de scend from their necks, like those which are seen amongst the inhabitants of the valleys in Switzerland. The Piedmontese in general, and especially the inhabitants of Turin, are the least lively of any of the people of Italy. They have, indeed, a sort of sadness about them, which almost in duces melancholy. The natives of the gen teeler description are elegant in their manners,"], [300, "284 PIEDMON T. have a considerable portion of solidity in their character, are studious and sensible, and write both French and Italian with great elegance. The lower orders are very industrious, and have every appearance of ease and comfort. They are remarkably fond of dress, and the shopkeepers' wives and daughters have no small portion of the French coquetry in their man ners. The Piedmontese cultivators of the soil are in general well off in their circumstances ; the country being remarkably fertile, and producing corn, rice, fruits, and vegetables, in the great est abundance. There are in Piedmont, an amazing number of fine mulberry trees, the leaves of which serve as food for the beautiful worms, whence is derived the silk which forms so considerable a branch of their commerce. The Piedmontese silk is, indeed, the best in all Italy ; and particularly the organzined : while the system of irrigating the meadows, as in the Milanese, by means of the numerous sluices, canals, and rivers, is a perpetual source of benefit to the agricultural interest. Montferrato and Asti produce excellent wines ; indeed, the best in all Piedmont. Asti is rather a considerable town, and cannot con tain fewer than eight or ten thousand inha bitants. In it is the family mansion of the"], [301, "285 PIEDMONT. great tragic poet, Alfieri. All along the plains, to the very confines of the Alps, is to be seen an abundance of the finest cattle. A certain French author, in giving a descrip tion of Italy, tells his readers, that Piedmont \" est un pays peu favorise de la nature.\" Alas ! how happy would the people of Italy have been, generally, and the Piedmontese in parti cular, had this been the case ! The most destructive vice of gaming is but too prevalent amongst the Turinese. Tarraco is the national game. The cards vary from those used in other countries, and are greater in num ber. The billiard tables at Turin are also too much frequented. The Piedmontese are a very hospitable people ; and especially those who reside in the country. To say the honest truth, it is much easier to gain admission, both to the houses and to the tables of the Italians, from the affa bility and familiarity of their manners, than it is in any other country in Europe \u2014 a fact this, which proves that there exists a much less por tion of distrust in the Italian character, than foreigners have been led to believe. Formerly, any person possessing a good ad dress and a genteel appearance, would, on making an acquaintance at a coffee-house, be"], [302, "286 PIEDMONT. invited home by the most respectable inhabi tants, and introduced to their families ; but, unfortunately, together with many other humane and estimable customs, the French Revolution has destroyed and rooted out this amiable national characteristic ! The moral conduct of the people of Turin is not so loose and incorrect as it is at Milan, at Naples, and at many other of the principal cities in Italy. The excellent example afforded by the regularity uniformly observed by the court, has the effect of keeping the higher or ders at least, within the external bounds of decency and rectitude. The young Turinese ladies are kept shut up in convents, until the period of their marriage. A good deal of con traband gallantry may, peradventure, exist among the higher order of married women ; but, in the second class, it is less frequent, and is car ried on with much secrecy. In point of years, the marriages in this country are often ofthe most disproportionate kind. The business is commonly all settled before the bride is once thought of. Her consent has, indeed, nothing to do with the business. The weighty points are the pin-money, a box at the opera, a car riage, a town-house and a country-house, and a whole train of male and female domestics."], [303, "287 \u25a0PIEDMONT The Piedmontese all follow the Catholic per suasion ; excepting at Lucerna, where a small population resides, in one of the districts of the Alps, who have been converted to protest antism, and who are protected in the peaceable exercise of their religion, by the public au thorities. The buildings at Turin are simple in their structure, but remarkable for their style of architecture. The king seldom resides in the city, but passes the greater portion of his time on the banks of the Po, at his different country seats, at Stupinegi, Villa della Regina, La Veneria, Rivoli, and also at Genoa. Turin was formerly protected with ramparts and ditches. It possessed also a citadel which was an uncommonly fine fortress, but which was nearly destroyed by the French. Indeed, it still remains ; but though it has been recently repaired, it is not strong enough to protect the capital from an invading army. The library is very a good one. The biblical treasures it contains are immense. In the Uni versity, and the Museum, are to be seen an excellent collection of antiques ; and amongst which, is the famous Isiac table of brass, found at Mantua, covered with Egyptian hierogly phics. Literature and the fine arts are much"], [304, "288 P I E D JI O N T. cultivated in this city. Indeed Turin has given birth to many distinguished classical writers. The Savoy family is said to be the eldest in Europe, excepting the royal family of Eng land, and dates its origin from the time of the Tarquins. The Sovereigns of Piedmont have ever been absolute. They have, however, ex ercised their power with much mildness, and many of them have been great politicians as well as warriors. Victor Emanuel, who recently abdicated the throne, was brother to the Charles Emanuel, who \u2014 after the death of the Saint-like Clotilda, who fell a sacrifice to grief, in consequence of the cruel martyrdoms of her brother, Louis the Sixteenth ; her angelic sister, the Princess Eli zabeth ; and her adored sister-in-law, the much injured and ever-regretted Queen of France \u2014 abdicated, and took up his residence at Rome, where he resided until his death. He was mar ried to Maria Theresa, Arch-Duchess of Aus tria ; by whom he had four daughters. Victor Emanuel was much beloved by his subjects, and was considered as an excellent prince, and a man plain in his manners, easy of access, and greatly attached to the people over whom he reigned. Nor would it be possible for the most evilly disposed person to fix on"], [305, "289 P 1 E D JI 0 N T. him an act of injustice. Indeed, the dignified conduct of king, queen, and princess, after their return to Turin, impressed every one with the greatest respect for them ; and, in particular, for the queen, who was greatly and justly beloved for her amiable manners, her enlight ened understanding, and her uncommon talents. She spoke three languages with equal elegance and fluency. The present queen, too, is generally beloved for her exemplary conduct, her piety, and her uncommon goodness of disposition : while her unbounded charity proves her to be a genuine daughter of her generous-hearted and immortal mother, the late Queen Caroline of Naples ; to whose memory I have already endeavoured to pay my humble tribute of gratitude and af fection. The great misfortune of the late sovereign was that of having restored, upon his return to his dominions, the absolute power which he had been accustomed to exercise previously to the French revolution. The civil and criminal code of laws introduced by the French, imper fect as it was, and unsuited to the habits and dispositions of their transalpine subjects, was undoubtedly more favourable to freedom, and better suited to the times, than the former one : VOL.

For instance, a subject of his Sardinian Ma jesty is attached to the soil, and cannot dispose of his immoveable property, nor absent himself therefrom, without the royal permission. There is, too, a marked difference between the pu nishments set apart for the noblesse, and those which are applied to the lower orders : like the law in Spain, by which an illegitimate person committing a deadly crime, is never hanged ; upon the presumption, that he may, perchance, be the son of a grandee ; and there fore has he the amazing privilege of being sent out of the world a head shorter than he came into it, instead of being hung up by the neck \u2014 and all for the honour of the thing ! The judges in Piedmont were accustomed to demand a fee for every sentence they pro nounced ; and without which sentence, there were no means of enforcing punishment. Ar bitrary power of this description, when placed in the hands of men who are under no respon sibility but to their own consciences, must ever be liable to the grossest abuse. Another vicious practice obtained, not only in Piedmont, but nearly all over Italy ; namely,"], [307, "PIEDMONT. 291 legal procrastination, and by which procrastina tion individuals were often suffered to lie rotting in the prisons, year after year, before their fates were finally decided upon. Amongst the most crying vices, were the salvi condotti, and the biglietti del Re ; which were protections, given by the king to favourite individuals who were in embarrassed circum stances, and by which the creditor was often kept out of his property for years, and some simes in secula seculorum ; as the biglietti em powered a nobleman to re-enter upon the pos session of property which he had disposed of, during the political changes that had taken place, on returning the sum that had been originally paid him, without giving a valuable consider ation for the money that might have been laid out in repairing the buildings, in draining the marshes, and in other expensive improvements. Primd facie, no doubt, this appears a most violent and arbitrary proceeding, to be sanc tioned by royal authority. But, the fact was, that the exorbitant contributions that were often levied on these noblemen compelled them to dispose of their property for a mere trifle, for the sake of preserving their personal liberty or their lives ; and, when the restoration took place, the King of Sardinia found himself u 2"], [308, "292 PIEDMONT. obliged, from policy, to protect those who had formerly been sacrificed for their fidelity to his cause. That there were a great number of abuses on both sides, there can be little doubt. The above measures did not, however, fail to di minish greatly the popularity of the late reign ing family ; though the ministry were certainly composed of individuals of strict honour and unimpeachable probity, as well as of consider able talents. The Count Brigioli, the Count Balbi, the Count San Marsan, and others, were alike respected for their private virtues as for their public services. The barbarous and horrible punishment of the wheel is still resorted to against criminals guilty of house-breaking, robbery, and murder. The exorbitant duties on exports and imports are much complained of by the commercial interest, and are alleged to be highly des tructive to the spirit of industry. Beggars are less frequently met with in the streets of Turin, than in any other city of Italy. The police is excellent ; and the streets are well lighted up, and kept in a cleanly condition. This city is about two miles in length, and con tains a population of little less than a hundred thousand souls. It is built in the form of a"], [309, "293 P J E D JI O N T. star. By standing on a certain stone in the centre, the streets may be seen all branching regularly from it ; each street terminating with a beautiful view of the surrounding country. One of the most praiseworthy public in stitutions to be met with at Turin is La Rosina. It is an asylum for female orphans, who are industriously educated and instructed in all sorts of needle-work, and who are ena bled thereby to earn a sufficiency for the sup port of the establishment. The public prisons in Turin, as well as the houses of correction, are, like those of the rest of Italy, in a shocking and even disgusting condition. Humanity revolts at the little at tention that is paid to these establishments ; from which Christian charity appears to be totally excluded, and in which the misery which the wretched inmates are destined to undergo, is calculated rather to engender a savage resent ment against their hard-hearted keepers, than to redeem them from the paths of vice, and render them, on their return to society, useful subjects for the remainder of their lives. O ! that the Buxtons, and the Frys, and the Gur neys, and the rest of the followers in the foot steps of the immortal Howard, who, by their unwearied exertions have so greatly improved u 3"], [310, "294 P I E D JI O N T. the Discipline ofthe Prisons of our own country, had but leisure to look into those of forlorn Italy, and thereby to complete the good work, so long ago set on foot by that excellent man, who devoted his time, his strength, his fortune, and finally sacrificed his life, in the pursuits of humanity ; and who, in the expressive language of the immortal Burke, \" visited all Europe, not to survey the sumptuousness of palaces, or the -stateliness of temples ; not to make accurate measurements of the remains of antient gran deur, nor to form a scale of the curiosity of modern art ; not to collect medals, or to collate manuscripts : but, to dive into the depths of dungeons ; to plunge into the infections of hospitals ; to survey the mansions of sorrow and of pain ; to take the gauge and dimensions of misery, depression, and contempt ; to remem ber the forgotten ; to attend to the neglected ; to visit the forsaken ; and to compare and col late the distresses of all men in all countries.\" With regard to the political feelings of the people, it is very natural for the old aristo cratical nobility, who revelled in milk and honey, and who contributed, neither in the way of taxes nor of other personal duties, to the exigencies of the state, to sigh for the res toration of that system."], [311, "295 PIEDMONT. The majority of the people, however, regret the loss of the French government ; and espe cially the rising generation, who had fondly flattered themselves with the idea of one dav becoming the instruments of their country's independence. From the dazzling example of the French, they were worked up to a pitch of enthusiasm ; but soon, alas, they found the good old proverb realized \u2014 \" God for us all ; but every one for himself.\" Again, and again, and again, I repeat \u2014 that, if the people of Italy ever expect to accomplish the independence of their country, aid of every description, except that which they may derive from their own united strength, will tend only still further to tarnish their glory, and more firmly to rivet the fetters by which they are now bound down to the earth. The Ergastolo, at Turin, serves as an asylum for that unfortunate class of females, whose depravities have already inflicted upon them almost the greatest punishment that can pos sibly accompany human misery ; namely, that of being an outcast of society \u2014 a situation this, which loudly calls on every civilized nation to ameliorate their hard lot, and to awaken them to a sense of their degraded condition, rather by a mild and encouraging treatment, than by u 4"], [312, "296 P I E D M O N T. resorting to a system of needless rigour, which can only have the effect of confirming them in vice ; and of exciting in their breasts a desire to return to the vicious pursuits which they had abandoned, from seeing themselves treated as if they were still in the practice of them. Lenity will generally be found to effect what severity can never accomplish. As La Fontaine justly observes, Plus fait douceur que violence.\" The King's forces are, for the greater part, composed of Piedmontese. The rest are Ge noese, Savoyards, Sardinians, and Nissards. The Savoyards and the Genoese are constantly at variance with the Piedmontese : so much so, indeed, that it has long been found necessary, in order to prevent mischief, never to allow these regiments to garrison in the same town. When completed, the army of the King of Sardinia may be reckoned to consist of about sixty thousand of the finest men, bearing the most martial appearance, and capable of under going greater fatigues, privations, and hard ships, than any of the other Italians. The late abdicated monarch was remarkably fond of the military, and would drill his officers him self, in the gardens of his palace."], [313, "PIEDMONT. 297 Provisions of all kinds are extremely cheap at Turin. The veal, mutton, lamb, and poul try, are excellent. Milk, cheese, and butter, are to be met with in the same perfection as in the Milanese. They have also a peculiar sort of bread, made in the shape of a bamboo cane, called grissin, which is preferred by the Pied montese to the common bread. When broken, it eats like biscuit. The kitchens in Piedmont are in a much better condition and more endurable, than those in any other part of Italy. The oil, which is so much used in the south, is nearly banished from the cookery. Indeed, the famous French cooks were formerly sent to finish their educa tion at Turin, in the kitchen of his royal high ness the Duke de Chablee, who was allowed by the gourmands of the day, to keep the most exquisite table in all Europe. Truffles are abundant in Piedmont, and are allowed to be superior to those of any other country, in size, colour, and flavour. They are variegated like nutmegs. Excellent fish is also to be met with in Piedmont. The common wines are not to be boasted of; but those of Asti and Monteferrato are good bodied, and both red and white are equal in quality to almost any in Italy."], [314, "298 P I E D JI O N T. Lodgings are remarkably cheap at Turin ; which city abounds likewise in all kinds of tables d'hote and restaurateurs, where every thing that the belly of the veriest glutton can yearn after, may be obtained on moderate terms. There are also a number of coffee houses and ice shops, where the gentry of both sexes read the newspapers during the morning. But, by an Englishman, these papers are scarcely worth looking at, as they are mere copies from the French Journals ; no Editor in Italy being allowed to exercise his judgment, by offering his own honest opinions. In Piedmont there are numerous manufac tories of velvets, silks, stockings, tapestry, chamois leather gloves, ear-rings, &c. English cottons and French woollens, both raw and manufactured, are introduced by the way of Genoa. As Piedmont is the key of Italy, every Ita lian has a natural interest in its welfare; as well from its situation, as from the known valour and virtue of its inhabitants in former times. Let us hope that they will one day rise superior to the obloquy which now hangs over their heads, by imitating the noble examples set them by their valiant forefathers !

The best way of travelling from Venice to Padua, is to adopt the practice of the natives ; namely, to hire a boat called a peotta. The common conveyance, which is the barca di Padova, is changed at Oriago ; for the water becoming more shallow, the first boat is no further navigable. The price of the passage from Venice to Padua is about three or four Venetian livres. The boat is sometimes filled with tolerable society ; but, the one which sets off' from Venice at night and arrives at Padua the next morning, is by no means an advisable mode of travelling ; not that it is unsafe, but the company consists of such an olla podrida of fish, flesh, and fowl, mixed pell-mell toge ther, of all sorts and sizes, old and young, thief takers and market women, butchers and what not, that a decent traveller becomes heartily tired of his journey before he arrives at the end of it. These vessels are towed up and down the Brenta, by means of horses. When the passen gers happen to be particularly desirous of quick-"], [317, "PADUA 301 ening their pace, for the purpose of getting in an hour or two before the usual time, they club each of them a trifle, and thereupon the master of the barca, according to the sum given him, will clap on an additional horse or two. If any of the passengers should become tired of tra velling by water, carriages are always ready to convey them by land. The company in the day boats are generally entertained with music and singing, performed by strollers, who pick up a livelihood in this way. They are also often honoured by the presence of one of those itinerant improvisatori, for which Italy is so renowned. Persons attend regularly to supply you with fruit, wine, liqueurs, oys ters, and other eatables and drinkables, accord ing to the season. Every thing may, however, be procured on the banks of the river; as the boats are constantly stopping to take in and let out passengers and parcels, and also to dine, if the company should be so disposed. A peotta is a private concern, and will either stop or proceed, at the convenience of those by whom it has been hired. I should here observe, that foreigners, on changing the boat at Oriago, are generally as sailed by innumerable idle fellows, who offer to assist them in removing their luggage. They"], [318, "302 PADUA. should, however, be especially careful, on entering the boat, for the sake of economy as well as security, to place every thing under the charge of the master of the vessel. Padua is a large and antient city. The streets are wretchedly paved, and its buildings greatly resemble those of the city of Bologna. Some of the streets have arcades and are re markably narrow. The city is supplied with abundance of water, both for public and pri vate use. Its situation is remarkably pleasing. The soil is exceedingly fertile, and produces an abundance of the necessaries as well as the luxuries of life, at a moderate rate. But, notwithstanding all these advantages, Padua is thinly populated. For, if we except the convents, the seminaries, and the famous university, founded by the Emperor Frederick the Second, in opposition to that of Bologna, and at one time containing eighteen thousand students, Padua does not contain a tenth part of the number of inhabitants which it is capable of holding with convenience. \" Mantua v\u00e6 miser\u00e6 nimium vicina Cremon\u00e6 ! \" The neighbourhood of Venice, of which Padua is supposed to be the mother, has, in many respects, been fatal to her: and parti-"], [319, "PADUA 303 cularly so, since the overthrow of the Venetian government and the destruction of her com merce; the Padovese having been reduced to the necessity of depending for a subsistence solely on their territorial revenues. Though, during the existence of the Repub lic, Padua was chiefly supported by the Venetian nobility, and looked, before and after the Viag giatura of the Venetians, like a city deserted, in consequence of the plague ; yet, from their ancient enmity towards the Venetians, the in habitants, at the dissolution of the government, had the cruelty to refuse to them a daily supply of that first necessary of life, fresh water, and actually prohibited, for some days, all commu nication with the barges which conveyed it to Venice ; until at length they were compelled, by force, to desist from their inhuman and truly diabolical project. The first object of curiosity at Padua, is the church of its patron, Saint Antonio, whose tomb is surrounded with rich and exquisite basso-re lievos, in white marble of the purest quality, and finished in the highest style of workmanship, re presenting the wonderful miracles performed by Antonio. At the foot of it are steps for the ac commodation of the people who come to pay their devotions at the shrine of their favourite"], [320, "304 PADUA saint, whose body is supposed by them to emit a particular odour,highly agreeable to the olfactory nerves. There are, however, certain crevices, through which it would be no difficult matter to introduce balsams and other odoriferous sub stances. Not that I would, for the world, be supposed to insinuate, that monks or friars were ever capable of resorting to such scandalous im positions ! In the centre of a little court, in the front of the church, is a remarkably fine equestrian statue, modelled by Donatello of Florence, which was erected by the Venetian Republic, to the memory of the famous general, Gatame lata. The convent of Santa Giustina, the cradle of the first reformers of the order of Benedictines in Europe, is one of the finest in Italy. - The members of it were the richest of their order, and consisted of the most distinguished nobles of Venice and the Terra Firma. The Church of Santa Giustina was built by Andrea Riccio, after the designs of Palladio, and produces an effect approaching to that which is produced on beholding that ne plus ultra of all temples, Saint Peter's at Rome. The roof of the great nave, or body of the church, has seven domes, serving it both for light and orna-"], [321, "305 P A 1) V A. ment. The twenty-four chapels which encircle the lower part ofthe church, are richly adorned with specimens of the first architecture, of va rious orders, each differing from the other. The famous picture ofthe martyrdom of Santa Giustina, over the great altar, which is said to have taken place on the spot where the church stands, is considered the chef-d'\u0153uvre of Paul Veronese. The basso-relievo of the benches in the choir is admirable, and the design is, in every respect, fine and striking. It represents the prophecies of the Old Testament, relative to the coming of our Saviour, with their accom plishment in the New. Minutely to describe the beauties of this church would require a volume. The Convent of San Giustina was governed by one of its regular members, called the Padre Abbate ; as is the case, indeed, with most of the convents in Italy, excepting those which happen to be under the controul of the cardinals ; who are by no means considered in a favourable point of view by the other monks ; which monks, by way of revenge, thus define the character of the cardinal \u2014 \" animal rubrum omnium bene ficiorum capax, rapax, vorax.\" The office of Padre Abbate is held for three years ; at the ex piration of which time, the person who so held it VOL. II. x"], [322, "306 PADUA has no more rank or power, excepting the title, than the other friars of the community. But, \" once an abbot always an abbot.\" So he passes from one convent to another as the Padre Abbate ; though he cannot resume the office, in the convent to which he was first elected, until the expiration of nine years. One of the numerous wonders to be met with in Italy, is the immense town-hall in the Palazzo della Giustizia, which is more than ninety feet wide, and two hundred and sixty in length, and which has no other support for its vast ceiling, but its four walls. Here are to be seen the emblematical and astrological paintings by Pietro d' Apono, who, it is said, gave the design to the famous Giotto, the father of the Italian painters. Leandro Alberti, speaking of the said Pietro d'Apono, says, that this distinguished man \u2014 \" era eccelente astrologo e filosofo, benche no tato d' aver commercio et gran familarita col diavolo !\" Pietro, it seems, was born at a vil lage about four miles from Padua. He studied medicine for some time at Paris, and was there promoted to the degree of doctor in philosophy and physic. When he came to practise, he is said to have insisted on large sums for his visits. When sent for to attend Pope Honorius the"], [323, "307 PAD! A Fourth, he demanded four hundred ducats for each day's attendance. He was suspected of magic, and prosecuted by the Inquisition on that account. \" The common opinion of almost all authors,\" says Gabriel Naude, the physician to Lewis the Fourteenth, in his Apologie des Grands Hommes accuses de Magie, \" is, that Pietro was the greatest magician of his age ; that he had acquired the knowledge of the seven liberal arts, by means of seven familiar spirits, which he kept enclosed in a crystal ; and that he had the dexterity to make the money he had spent come back into his purse !\" Pietro d'Apono died, however, before the process against him was finished ; being then in the eightieth year of his age. And, after his death, he was ordered to be burnt in effigy, in the public place of Padua. There is a story told of Pietro, that, having no well in his house, he caused his neighbours to be carried into the street by devils, when he heard they had forbid den his maid to fetch water there. \" He had much better,\" says the shrewd Bayle, \" have employed the devils to make a well in his own house, and have stopped up his neighbour's ; or, at least, transported it into his house, rather than into the street.\" So much for Pietro d'Apono. In the town hall is also to be seen a cenotaph x 2"], [324, "308 P A D U A. to the memory of Titus Livius, the immortal historian of Rome, who was a native of Padua. In the Duomo, or cathedral, there are two very striking busts ; one of Pope Benedict the Fourteenth, the other of Cardinal Rozzonico, his successor. When he was Bishop of Padua, Rozzonico obtained from Benedict the renewal ofthe privileges of the cathedral, the revenues of which were better administered than those of any other cathedral in Italy. In grateful re membrance of which, and also of the good management ofthe cardinal bishop, the chapter erected, during his life-time, this monument to Benedict, which is executed in a superb and excellent style. In the sacristy of the cathedral there is a fine portrait of the celebrated Petrarch, who had been a canon of the said cathedral, and left thereto the greater part of his library. The portrait is said to have been taken during the life-time of the poet. His countenance is sin gularly bridled, and displays a mournful melan choly, such as might naturally be expected of a bard, who was eternally singing \u2014 \" de tant d'ennuis, mieux ecrits que penses.\" Besides a number of colleges, public as well as private, there is at Padua the Gymnasium, the interior of which is entirely disfigured on"], [325, "PADUA. 309 all sides, by satires and wretched verses, written by the students of all the nations of Europe, in favour of the different masters and professors. There is also, in an obscure corner of the build ing, an anatomical theatre, large enough to hold seven hundred persons ; each seat being divided from the other by a railing in an eliptical form. I have been informed, from undoubted au thority, that it was Fra Paolo who furnished the original plans of the building : for this cele brated man was as profound a geometrician, as he was a theologian and moral philosopher. The Venetians will have it, that he was the in dividual who first discovered the theory of the circulation of the blood. Be that as it may, what Blaise Pascal was to the French nation, Paul Sarpi certainly was to the Venetian Re public. It was under his superintendence and general auspices, that the great Galileo commenced his brilliant career at Padua, every step of which career was marked by discoveries which have immortalized his name ; and whose invaluable labours so deservedly insured to him the patro nage and the powerful protection of all the great men of the Republic, against the zealous and ignorant spirit of faction which then began x 3"], [326, "310 PADUA to discover itself among the professors in the several universities of Italy. Notwithstanding, however, the great support which he met with, from the prudence and the wisdom with which the Venetian government resisted the opposition of the factious to his new and astonishing discoveries, Galileo, en couraged thereto by the reiterated solicitations of his sovereign, Cosmo the Second, Grand Duke of Tuscany, determined upon quitting the situation which he enjoyed at Padua and in the Venetian states, and returning to Florence, his native country ; where he fondly hoped to enjoy, for the remainder of his days, that peace and that tranquillity, which the lasting benefits he had conferred on the world at large, so richly entitled him to. A correct idea of the lucrative situations which he enjoyed, of the rank in which he stood, and ofthe estimation in which he was held by the Venetian government, may be formed, from the perusal of a letter written by the patrician Gio van Francesco Sagredo to Galileo, on his quit ting the service of the Venetian Republic, in viting his return to the same in the strongest language, and almost foretelling the fatal con sequences that were likely to ensue, and that"], [327, "PADUA 311 actually did befal that great man.

It was the constant endeavour of Galileo to disencumber science of the jargon of Aristotle, and of the schools. He methodized and ar ranged the theory ofthe descent of bodies and"], [333, "317 P A D U A. projectiles ; and by fixing his eye accidentally on the waving to and fro of a lamp suspended from a lofty roof, the regularity of its vibra tions suggested to him the application of a pendulum to the mensuration and division of time. , It was Galileo's fate to meet with obstinate and bigotted opposers. Having been educated as a physician, he had, early in life, dissected human bodies ; a practice, as my readers well know, absolutely necessary for men in that profession. While he was attempting, on a cer tain occasion, to demonstrate to his associates, that many of the nerves originated from the brain, he at length silenced doubt, by positive ocular proof: \" I should be convinced you were right,\" was the reply of one of them, \" if your deduction was not contrary to the opinion of Aristotle !\" While speaking of the opposition which the immortal Galileo met with from the ignorance and fanaticism of his enemies, it may not be amiss to give a short anecdote, which will at once show, even in those dark ages of super stition, the superiority of the Venetian coun cils, in matters appertaining to opinion, and the freedom which writers, in the pursuit after knowledge, were allowed to enjoy."], [334, "318 PADUA. During one of the examinations, which it was customary for three of the members of the Procuratia of Venice, forming a sort of special jury, \" per la reforma dello studio di Padova,\" to make, from time to time, into the state ofthe university of Padua, Father Berlinzone accused Galileo, before the said members, and before the public assembly, of being a man ofthe most immoral and licentious habits ; asserting, that he kept one mistress at Padua, a second at the Gambarara, where he generally passed his time in the holidays, when he had leave of absence, and a third at Venice, which city he visited every week. Being interrogated by the magistrates, Gali leo replied, that his pursuits, both of body and mind, were the same as those of other men, and, in many points, the same as those of his accusers ; but that he had never been guilty of the things laid to his charge ; on the contrary, he stood in need of many little enjoyments, which his situation and his salary did not allow him to indulge in. After hearing Galileo's defence, the said magistrates retired for the purpose of confer ring on the subject. They returned, however, in a few minutes to the council-chamber ; and, to the great delight of all present, declared,"], [335, "PADUA 319 that they had consulted together, and had thought it necessary to double the salary ofthe accused ; which determination would, thev were confident, be immediately ratified by the Venetian Government ; which would, very pro bably, even again double it, the better to enable Galileo to employ his time for the fu ture, in the way most conducive to his own comfort, and to the advantage of the Re public. Galileo had not long left Padua and settled at Florence, before he soon found to his cost, that Aristotle's doctrine, however ill-grounded, was held too sacred to be safely called in question. Having, in the year 161 2, observed some solar spots, he published that discovery, in 1613, at Rome ; in which, and in some other pieces, he ventured to assert the truth of the Copernican system, and adduced many new arguments to confirm it. For so doing, he was cited before the Inquistion ; and after some months' imprisonment, was released upon a simple promise, that he would renounce his heretical opinions, and not defend them by word or by writing. But, having afterwards, in 1632, published, at Florence, his \" Dia logues of the two greatest Systems of the World, the Ptolemaic and Copernican,\" he was again"], [336, "320 P A D U A cited before the Inquisition, and committed to the prison of that dreadful court at Rome. The congregation were convened, and, in his presence, pronounced sentence against him and his books, obliging him to abjure his errors in the most solemn manner ; committed him to the prison of their office during their pleasure ; and enjoined him, as a saving penance, for three years, to repeat, once a week, the seven penitential psalms. \" Are these, then, my judges!\" exclaimed he, in retiring from the Inquisitors ; whose ignorance struck him with astonishment. In this dungeon he was kept for the space of a year, and some writers say for two or three ; and was continually threatened to be burnt alive, if he would not recant his heresies, as they were called. For a long time Galileo resisted ; but, on one of the monks, of the order of St. Dominic, informing him, that their court had condemned him to be burnt if he would not retract, poor Galileo, knowing that there was no appeal from their decision, ac quiesced, and consented to delare publicly, on his knees, that his doctrine was false. As he was ascending the steps of the inquisition, he whispered to one of the monks, who was his friend, and who, moreover, entertained the same \u25a0\u00bb"], [337, "321 PADUA opinion, \" pure padre mio, gira, gira, e non il sole ; truly, my father, it is the earth that goes round, and not the sun.\" While Galileo was in prison, he was visited by Milton, who informs us, he was then \" poor and old.\" The confessor of his widow, taking advantage of her piety, obtained leave to pe ruse the manuscripts of this great philosopher, and destroyed such as, in his judgment, were not fit to be known to the world ! Like Mil ton, poor Galileo became, in the year 1639, totally blind ; and, like Milton, he supplied the defect by constant meditation, and by dictat ing his sublime conceptions to others. One of the richest and most respectable establishments at present at Padua, is the seminary that was founded, towards the end of the seventeenth century, by the illustrious Car dinal Barbarigo, whose virtues have formed a subject worthy of the genius of the learned Dr. Burnet, in a panegyric, as distinguished for its elegance and force, as it is for its free dom from fulsome adulation. The Cardinal left to this excellent establishment a yearly revenue of fifteen thousand ducats ; which sum, together with its other funds, enables it to provide board, lodging, and other necessaries of life, for a hundred curates.

It has been said, that the Merceria at Venice has been well stocked and supplied, since the Austrians have become the rulers of the Vene- tian provinces.

If quarters of bull-beef; if trumpery tin-boxes filled with phosphoric matches ; if gin and coffee shops ; if tallow-chandlers', and barbers', and bakers' shops ; if cobblers'-stalls ; if the sacks of meal and grano Turco, which now fill this once beau- tiful place, instead of the diamonds, and the pearls, and the mountains of gold chains, un- equalled in quality by those of any other na- tion ; and the rich ancient and modem gems of every denomination and value \u2014 and the most costly manufactures and productions of all parts of the known globe, which exclusively filled them for fourteen centuries, and were the admiration and delight of every civilized coun- try \u2014 if, I say, an exchange of the last-men- tioned elegantarticles, for the coarse wares which it now contains, bespeaks it \" well stocked and supplied,\" then indeed is the Merceria well stocked and well supplied !

The greater part of the shops in the Mer ceria were formerly the property of the ancient nobility, who would only let them to the above most respectable class of merchants ; but, in consquence of the high taxes levied on them, and other ruinous operations of the Austrian Government, the effects of which have been a total stagnation of trade, the original lessees have abandoned them to even still more wretch ed proprietors, who, to satisfy the demands of the authorities, have been compelled to suffer them to be inhabited by the tag-rag and bobtail description of traders I have already mentioned, and even to the venders of fried fish and fri lotes \u2014 to the amazing annoyance of all the neighbourhood, from the offensive smell of the oil used by the followers of these savoury callings. That my readers may be able to form an idea of the way in which the Venetians are governed, and how strictly the orders of his Imperial Majesty are executed by his ministers, while his Imperial Majesty is travelling about, for the good of his faithful subjects, as well as for his own private amusement, I will give a few anecdotes. They contain facts, of which Y 4"], [344, "328 THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. his Imperial Majesty should not be kept in ignorance. His Imperial Majesty has issued a decree, directing, that no hawkers or pedlars shall be suffered to follow their ambulatory calling, in the Merceria, to the injury of the few respect able tradesmen who have shops there, and who pay enormously for them. Notwithstanding which, the understrappers of the police, in the teeth of this decree, allow them, on being paid a certain douceur, to place in it their filthy baskets, and boxes, and stalls, to the injury of the aforesaid shopkeepers, and the great annoyance and obstruction of pas sengers. Tt. 3 poor peasantry, who bring a few eggs to Venic are obliged to pay the sum of two pence, before they are suffered to sell them in the market ! Such a thing was never thought of under Buonaparte's rapacious government ; nor, indeed, under any government except the present. The tender-hearted and accommodating por tion of the fair sex are charged a stipulated sum, before they are allowed to carry on their meretricious profession. Being classed, by the present well-ordered and religious government, in the list of regular traders, of course, they"], [345, "THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. 329 are in duty bound to contribute their fair pro portion to the exigencies of the state ! This system of licensed prostitution, united to the general misery of the country, has very much tended to the increase of crime, and of the number of those free-trading artistes ; whose habitations, under the Venetian government, as well as under the ancient republics of France and Rome, were prudently confined to a par ticular part of the city. For the better in culcation, however, of good morals by good examples \u2014 which, no doubt, is the sole object of those who now rule, command, and ordain, in the once really happy Venice \u2014 the said fair traders are allowed to carry on their profession, and expose their articles, pro bono publico, in every quarter of the town ! But, from the vast contraband trade which is carried on between their last intruders' wives and daughters, the business of these fair traders is reported to have fallen off\u2014 to the great detriment of his Imperial Majesty's treasury ! The small canals at Venice are so much neg lected, that it is sometimes difficult to navigate the gondolas. The pavement in the Piazza di San Marco, once as even as glass, is become dangerous to walk on. The bridges also are in an equally dilapidated condition."], [346, "330 THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. Whenever his Imperial Majesty, or any of the illustrious princes of the august house of Austria, visit the city of Venice, or the pro vinces in the Terra- Firma, they generally leave behind them, for the honour they have con ferred on their subjects, a souvenir, in the shape of an augmentation of the price of all the ne cessaries of life, to defray the expence which has been incurred during their residence. The poor dejected citizens of Venice always pay dearly for the honour of having amongst them the \" father of his people.\" The sumptuous fetes given on these joyful occasions \u2014 the ex pence of the court \u2014 the lodgings for the impe rial household \u2014 are never paid for by the Go vernment, but are defrayed by new taxes levied on the people. The representations given on these occasions at the theatre Fenice, are al ways at the expence of the proprietors ; who, very often, are not even allowed a ticket for themselves or families ; as the government, on those nights, dispose of the whole house as it thinks proper. The Hospitals and Asylums for the poor were formerly innumerable at Venice. Medi cines too, and medical assistance, were afforded gratis to respectable poor families. Now, alas, the latter kindly practice is discontinued ; and"], [347, "331 THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. of the many former, only two remain, which take in male and female, civil and military, patients indiscriminately. All are huddled to gether in the same rooms, like those bundlings which we read of in American books of travels, or like the baths at Baden, near Vienna, where pure and impure, alike enjoy the luxury of the same delightful effluvia. And, as the provi vions and medicines required for these hospi tals are farmed to those who will supply them at the cheapest possible rate, it may readily be imagined, that the quality is not of the very best, nor the quantity the most abundant. During one of His Imperial Majesty's visits to Venice and the Terra Firma, he was much pleased with a building at Brescia, erected in the days of the Republic, as an asylum for re duced citizens, who were not of a class to be sent to the common infirmaries ; and which building, for a considerable time after the down fall of the Republic, had been supported by the voluntary contributions of private individuals ; Buonaparte having applied its funded revenues to other purposes. These private individuals, however, having themselves suffered so severely from plunder, and the heavy contributions levied upon them, were no longer in a condition to succour these"], [348, "332 THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. decayed citizens, or to keep the building in repair. This circumstance His Imperial Majesty feelingly lamented, and desired to know, what sum would be necessary to put it into a state to answer its primitive purpose. On being in formed, that a few thousand ducats would suffice to render it a comfortable home for the descrip tion of persons for whom it was originally in tended, his Imperial Majesty said, that he would give orders, that the money required should be sent, as soon as he should arrive at Milan ; kindly adding, \" that the worthy crea tures, for whose sake the building was originally erected, should not be in want of an asylum for so trifling a sum.\" His Imperial Majesty adhered to his promise ; and the money destined for so laudable a pur pose, was placed in the hands of the most res pectable inhabitants of Brescia, subject to the inspection of the government agents, that not a ducat might be laid out unnecessarily. Nay, so desirous were the gentlemen of Brescia to see the gracious intention of His Imperial Majesty carried into complete effect, that the sum sent was increased by individual donations. But, alas ! by way of return for the trouble, and anxiety, and expence they had been at, they received from the Aulic Council at Vienna,"], [349, "THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. 333 a few months after, a peremptory and positive order to refund the money so given, and so em ployed. This happened, to the best of my re collection, in the year 1816 ; and, when the gentlemen of the committee for the said charity remonstrated with the Aulic Council, and stated, that the money had been remitted by order of His Imperial Majesty, for the express purpose of defraying the expence of the repairs necessary to prevent the entire destruction of the said useful building, and that without it, the unfor tunate inmates must have perished in the streets, or have become common paupers or thieves, to avoid actual starvation ; the only answer they received from Vienna was, that \" the money must be refunded ! \" When I left the country, this circumstance was the leading topic in every conversazione. Let the Austrian Government refute what I have asserted, if it can. Ready am I to apologize, and to atone, for any mistake or misapprehension into which I may have been led. But, the truth is, that, since the death of the great Prince Kaunitz, no minister of Austria has had the good policy to treat its Italian subjects otherwise than as a race of conquered slaves, fitted only to live under the lash of a military government. It is not thus with the Germans in Austria."], [350, "334 THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. The government at Vienna is a paternal govern ment. The Emperor Francis is, on all hands, allowed to be a mild and affable, a humane and just, monarch. May the evil be probed to its real source ! The city of Treviso is well populated, and is surrounded with the country seats of the Ve netian nobility, it being only twelve miles from Venice. Formerly, the post went and came from the one city to the other every day ; but, in consequence of recent Austrian regulations, the inhabitants of Treviso are deprived of the pleasure of sending letters to, or receiving let ters from, Venice more than once in five days ; namely, on those days in which the courier goes to and from Vienna ; though they pay six times as much for the postage of these letters, as they did under the old Venetian government. In consequence of this, there are no means of communication between Venice and Treviso, but by sending expresses on horseback, at a considerable expence ; and even then, if the writer of the letter should have omitted to have put the word \" express \" on the outside of it, the man is not allowed to proceed, and the writei is liable to a penalty. The private inhabitants, the merchants, and the nobility of Treviso, offered the government,"], [351, "335 THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. therefore, to maintain, at their own expence, the former regulations of communication between that city and Venice ; but, incredible as it may seem, the offer was rejected with disdain ; as, indeed, every thing is, that does not originate in that sanctum sanctorum, the Camera Aulica at Vienna. From the organization of the Austrian laws at present in force at Venice, a poor creditor stands no chance whatever of recovering his claim against a rich debtor. First, from the deficiency of the laws themselves ; secondly, from the ignorance of those by whom they are administered ; and, thirdly, from the enormous stamp and register duties on all legal proceed ings, and from paying which duties not even paupers are exempted. This latter is indeed a crying evil : but, it is an evil which, unhappily, is not confined to Italy ! The attention of the parliament of our own country has recently been called to this all important subject, by that upright senator, and sensible and benevolent model of an English gentleman, Mr. John Smith, the member for Midhurst. Heaven prosper the good work ! In justice, too, to the memory of the late excellect political economist, Mr. David Ricar do, I must here state, that he was accustomed"], [352, "336 THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. to say, that \" almost every public man who was labouring to ease the burdens of the people, by the reduction of taxation, had his particular hobby-horse ; some were for taking off this tax, and some that ; but his own hobby-horse was, the reduction of the enormous stamp duties on legal proceedings, and which enormous stamp duties operated, in the case of the poorer class of -the community, as an absolute denial of justice I A will, executed with all the prescribed for malities of the laws of Venice, may, under the Austrian mode of judicature, be set aside and declared null and void, upon two persons coming forward and swearing, that the deceased had promised by word of mouth, in their pre sence, to dispose of his property otherwise. In my strictures on the Napoleon system of government in Italy, I have candidly confessed, that thousands of the labouring poor were con stantly employed in keeping the high roads in repair ; that the revenues of the Venetian state, and more than the revenues of the Venetian state, were expended in that country, in encou raging the fine arts, in the establishment of schools for the education of youth, and in re wards given to men of literature and of science. All, however, has been totally bouleversd, ex-"], [353, "337 THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. cept the most rigorous military promptitude in exacting the government taxes ; in which no mercy is shown, and no discrimination is made, with regard to persons or circumstances. In short, every thing that was laudable in the French system of rule, has been abolished \u2014 every thing in it that was vexatious, oppressive, and humiliating, or calculated to perpetuate the miseries of that once incomparably flourishing state, has been retained, to the eternal disgrace of its rulers. To draw down upon the heads of the poor Venetians the compassion of all Eu rope, it is only necessary to compare their former prosperity with their present degradation. May the pen, now in my hand, become an humble instrument in the righteous cause ! During the time of the Venetian Republic, all the offices of great public trust were filled by the patricians, whose residences were at a consi derable distance from the Ducal Palace, where most of those offices were concentred. For the sake of convenience, therefore, the said patri cians had casinos allotted to them in St. Mark's Place, or near it. Part of the building called the Procuratia was also specially appropriated to their use. On the fatal dissolution of the government, vol. 11. z"], [354, "338 THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. these casinos, which formerly served the patri cians for apartments to dress and undress in, when they went to, or came from, their different offices, as well as for dwellings in the bad season, when it would have been imprudent to risk them selves on the Grand Canal, were rendered en tirely useless. Many of their proprietors retired to the country, intending, if possible, to make a trifle by letting these casinos. From so doing, they were, however, prevented, by the civil and military authorities, who took violent possession, without allowing any thing for the use of them, though there was then a decree of his Imperial Majesty in existence, commanding all those who were employed under the Austrian Government, not to inhabit any lodging without duly paying for the same. Nevertheless, no magistrate could be prevailed upon to enforce the imperial de cree ; and, in defiance of all justice and all equity, the individuals who ought to have been their guardians, were the very first to violate the sacred law of hospitality towards the objects whom they were bound and pledged to protect, by suffering the invasion of their property with impunity. The noble the Marquis Marruzzi, together with his mother and sister, were kept out of"], [355, "THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. 339 their superb suite of apartments in the Procu ratia, for years ; until at length, tired out, he determined on making a journey to Vienna, for the purpose of obtaining permission to turn out the intruders ; and, after a struggle of some years, he was suffered to retake possession of his own property, after it had been shamefully damaged and defaced by the filthy Austrian employes. From the same cause, Francesco, one of the princely family of Pisani, had been obliged to quit the magnificent palace at San Stefano, and take up his abode at Padua ; though every housekeeper pays five per cent, upon the value of his palace, towards the support of the mili tary, that soldiers may not be quartered upon them, to the irreparable injury of their beautiful buildings and paintings. The damage that has been done by the Aus trians, from the more than Gothic savagism of introducing enormous iron stoves into these pa laces, which they heat until they are red hot, is inconceivable, and, in many instances, has ter minated in their total destruction by fire. In this way, the magnificent palace Cornaro, which is situated on the grand canal, fell a sacrifice, in the month of December 18 17, to the total ruin z 2"], [356, "340 THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. of numerous clerks, who had deposited their property therein. For these Hottentots, if there were five hundred rooms in a palace, are sure to settle their dirty carcases in the galleries which contain the finest paintings ; and there, Vandal like, will they amuse themselves, by mutilating and destroying every vestige of former Venetian grandeur! To be convinced ofthe extent ofthe mischief occasioned by the operations of these barbarians, in cases of fire, my reader has only to bear in re collection the account I have given, in my first volume, of the destruction committed during the fire in the afore-mentioned palace, by a set of savages, more intent upon plunder than on the extinguishment thereof What the implacable element had spared, was speedily demolished by a horde of five hundred Croats ; creatures, who, to this day, are as uncivilized as are any of the slaves of Africa. But, what was to be expected from a race of beings whose senses are benumbed by their native atmosphere ; and on whom the sun \" scorns to shine\" for eight months out of the twelve, and, for the other four, has not suf ficient power to thaw their frozen natures by its genial heat? The fires that have been so frequent in all the"], [357, "341 THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. public offices, have been the result of the most far-fetched avarice that ever entered into the mind of the meanest of governments ; namely, the compelling the clerks in the different public offices to labour many hours by candle-light. In consequence of which, when the master whipper-in allows them to depart\u2014 without whose permission they dare not budge an inch \u2014 they are all so anxious, after having been confined for twelve or fourteen hours, to quit their tread-mills and their task-masters, that they set off, leaving the horrible iron stoves, of which I have been speaking, red hot ! In the happy time of the Republic, during a period of fourteen centuries, all kinds of public business was terminated before sunset. Since the Austrians have become the unnatural and illegitimate rulers of Venice, there have been, I boldly assert, more accidents in that city, oc casioned by fire, than there were during the whole of the afore-mentioned long period. The beautiful Procuratia, in one part of which the governor, the Count de Goess, has thought proper to take up his residence, has already been more than once damaged by fire ; and, should these Vandals persevere in their barbarous northern system, there can be little doubt, that z3"], [358, "342 THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. one day or other, this, the finest building in Europe, will fall a sacrifice to the execrable innovation. German stoves were never intended to be the inmates of marble Italian palaces. \" O ! reform it altogether.\" It is exactly the same with respect to the German system of legislation, which is not at all suited to the soil and character of the Italian people. The strongest proof of this erroneous perseverance therein, is to be found in the ex treme difficulty with which the laws, arising out of that system, are execnted, by violence and by force. In consequence of this there have been more appealsto whatis called law, during the short rule ofthe Austrians in the Venetian territory, than there had been for centuries duringthe time ofthe Republic. And, until theyr can make it appear, that the sterile and frozen regions of Lapland resemble the delicious and luxuriant climate of Italy, all northern laws and regulations will an swer no good purpose, but will merely tend to hasten their own destruction, by daily increasing the disaffection, and weakening the attachment, of the people, by forcibly compelling them to submit to laws, which are altogether unconge nial with their native habits."], [359, "THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. 343 Now, politically speaking, the laws of a country should always be adapted to the nature ofthe soil. Until we can metamorphose them into Germans \u2014 until we can change their pure climate into a bleak one, the produce of their generous vineyards into brown kale, their wines into beer, their figs and their grapes into sauer krout, their rich fruits into coarse knudles, and their natural vivacity into phlegmatic pedantry \u2014 or vice versd \u2014 Italians will be Italians, Ger mans will be Germans ; and, though both na tions may have their respective virtues and good qualities, they cannot become cordially united. Force and violence may be resorted to, but the task will be found too hard a one to be accom plished \u2014 Naturam expellas furca, tamen usque recurret, ' Strive to expel strong nature \u2014 'tis in vain ; ' With double force she will return again.\" The futility of every attempt to change human nature ought to be a lesson to all governments. It is the rock upon which most of our political calculators have run foul, and was one of the great errors of Buonaparte's misguided and fallacious policy ; since he foolishly imagined, that it would be as easy to compel every man"], [360, "344 THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. to become French, as it was to gain the much talked-of battle of the bridge of Lodi ; over which bridge he passed, by crying out to the Italians, \" Liberty and Independence ! \" To the magic sound of those two words, in the ears of the too credulous people of Italy, was he mainly indebted for his first influence amongst them. But, how woefully did he afterwards betray them ! If the Emperor of Austria be determined to follow in Napoleon's footsteps ; or, if he fancy that he can transform Italians into Germans, and attach them by affection to German laws, in the same way as his dear son-in-law falla ciously calculated on attaching them to the laws of France ; the fate of the exile of St. Helena, holds out to him an awful, but instructive lesson, as to the consequences that may be predicted of such a fatal line of conduct. The history of the Romans, of Charlemagne, of Charles the Twelfth of Sweden, of the Emperor Charles the Fifth, and even of Napoleon Buonaparte, proves to the world \u2014 that a people who have been conquered will fight, until they learn how to conquer ! From all the circumstances which I have de tailed in this my humble performance, I think"], [361, "345 THE AUSTRIANS IN ITALY. I have proved, most indisputably, that the Ve netians have been treated as a nation of vile slaves ; nay, worse \u2014 as a nation of conquered rebels, instead of being treated as an enlight ened, an intelligent, a free, and an independent people. Nay, their state of abject degradation has been rendered still more galling to them, from the consideration, that that which is denied to them, has been yielded to the negro, by all the Christian powers in Europe \u2014 by the very power which now holds the people of Italy in slavery ! It is heart-rending to reflect, that the only nation still groaning under the galling weight of a foreign yoke, should be the very nation, that fled from the tyranny of a barbarous Gothic invasion, to the uncultivated marshes of the Adriatic, rather than sacrifice that liberty and that independence, which have animated the bosoms of a Livy, a Father Lana, a Marco Paolo, a Petrarca, a Dandolo, a Carlo Zen, a Tressino, a Foscari, a Sapi, a Goldoni, a Gozzi, and a Canova \u2014 all men of the greatest eminence in their respective professions, and whose ta lents and virtues, though they may have been equalled, have never been excelled.
