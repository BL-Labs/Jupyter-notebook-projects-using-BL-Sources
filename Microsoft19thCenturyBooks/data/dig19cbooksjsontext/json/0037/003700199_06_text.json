The Volume of the History of Scotland, now published, comprehends the period from the assassination of Cardinal Beaton in 1546, to the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots, with Henry, Lord Darnley, in 1565, an interval, brief, indeed, in point of time, burt prolific in events, and most momentous in their consequences. In proof of this, it is enough to say, that it embraces the history of the Reformation in Scotland : it includes the out- break, the progress, and the establishment of that wonderful revolution, of which, in a former volume, the Author has marked the faint approaches, but which now, with all its conflicting principles, its mingled feelings,"], [14, "VI PREFACE. and stern features, comes prominently before us. Preceding this great event, occurs the violent and impolitic invasion of the Protector Somerset, and the English war with the united forces of France ;.nd Scotland. In more immediate connexion with it, the Author has traced, with greater detail than former writers, the history of the Regency of Mary of Lorraine, the crafty and unscrupulous policy of Elizabeth and Cecil, the plots of the Guises, and the selfishness, venality, and restless intrigues, of the Scottish nobles, as well Protestant as Romish. Upon these subjects he has had access to a large mass of valuable manuscript materials, of which the greater part has been hitherto unprinted and unexamined.

If the fact had not been already apparent, the events which immediately succeeded the assassi nation of the cardinal rendered it impossible for any one to escape the conclusion that the conspiracy had been encouraged by the English monarch. Scarcely was the act perpetrated when letters were despatched to Lord Wharton, the English warden, by some of those numerous spies whom he retained, describing the consternation which the event had produced in the capital, the change in affairs which was likely to ensue, and the necessity for immediate exertion on the part of his master.1 On the other hand, the conspirators, who had seized the castle of St. Andrew's, were soon joined by many adherents, previously the most zealous supporters of the English interests ; and who, although not present at the murder, believed that it would subject them to suspicion and persecution2 * 1 MS.

Whilst such was the conduct of the English sac tion, the Governor Arran, and the Queen Regent, exerted themselves to maintain the cause of order, and to bring to punishment those bold and daring men, who had so unscrupulously taken the law into their own hands. A convention of the nobility, spiritual and temporal, was held at Stirling, on the 10th of June* and nothing was left unattempted by which a cordial union might be promoted amongst the parties which separated and distracted the state. The meeting was attended by the chief persons of both factions, by the Earls of Angus, Cassillis and Glencairn, to whose devotion to the English interests many of the late disorders might be attributed, as well as by Huntly, Argile, and the Lords Flem ing and Elphinston, who were the leaders in the faction attached to France, and interested in the support of the Romish faith.2 To conciliate the lords 1 Knox's History, p. 74.

Accordingly, after an ineffectual attempt to negociate, a parliament was convoked (29th July, 1546) in which they were declared guilty of treason:2 proclamation was made, interdicting all persons from affording them the slightest assistance in their rebel lion, and the Governor having assembled an army commenced the siege, with a determination speedily to reduce the fortress. This, however, was found a task of no easy execution : it was naturally strong, and its fortifications had been repaired at great expense by its late master ; on the one side the sea rendered it impregnable, and on the land quarter the thickness of its walls defied the imperfect and ill served artillery of the times. Beaton, from a prin ciple of security had provisioned it fully against attack, and even were it attempted to starve out the garrison, the English fleet which commanded the Firth might at any time throw in supplies.

It may convey tous some idea of the imperfection of the military art in these times, when we find a single castle, with a small garrison, resist- ing for a long period the utmost efforts of the Go- vernor. To make himself master of it he divided the kingdom into four great districts, and the military force of each division was brought successively to bear upon the fortress,1 yet without any nearer prospect of success. At length, towards the end of December, the garrison showed a disposition to capitulate ; their principal defences were greatly injured by the artillery, and they began to suffer from a scarcity of provisions and sickness.2 Had Arran been aware of this, instead of listening so any offer for a cessation of hostilities, he mio-ht within a short period have made himself master of the place \u2014 but ignorant of the real condition of the besieged, he accepted terms dictated to him by men who were at the last extremity.

At the same moment that these proposals were transmitted to Arran, the Castilians sent an envoy to Henry the Eighth, in forming him of their proceedings, declaring that their only object was to gain time to revictual the castle, that they had no intention whatever of abiding by their agreement, and would thus be able to perform their first promises to the English monarch. For this purpose they requested Henry to write to the Em peror, causing him to intercede with the Pope \" for the stopping and hindering of their absolution,\" by which means a longer time would be given them to accomplish their purposes.1 These conditions Arran accepted, being solicitous, as has been alleged, to protract the time till the arrival of foreign assist ance ; and intending to be as little faithful as his opponents to the terms of their agreement.

Knox, whom we have hitherto known chiefly as the affec tionate and courageous disciple of Wishart, had retreated into the castle with the barons of Or miston and Long Niddry and their sons, whose edu cation he conducted. In the chapel within the fort he catechised his pupils, and delivered lectures on the Scriptures, where a little congregation was soon assembled, who earnestly entreated him to preach publicly to the people. This, however, he at first peremptorily declined, observing \" that he would not run where God had not called him,\"2 but they who were deeply interested in his assuming the office of the ministry, for which they believed him to be eminently qualified, determined to overcome his re luctance. John Rough, whom we have seen dismissed, on account of his zeal for the Reformation, from the situation of chaplain to Arran the Governor, had taken 1 MS.

Francis notwithstanding his occasional political predilection for the Protestants, 1 Knox's History, p. 75. 2 M(Cr;es Life of Knox, p. 40. Edition 1812. Ibid. p. 43.

Immediately after his coronation, Mon sieur D'Osell was despatched to that country to confirm the league which had so long bound its in terests to France; assurances of support were liberally held out against the ambitious designs of England, and D'Osell, who enjoyed the intimate confidence of the Queen Dowager, remained as ambassador at the Scottish court.1 In England, the accession of Edward the Sixth, then a promising boy in his ninth year, and the assumption of the protectorate by his uncle the Duke of Somerset, brought no change of policy in deal ing with Scotland. Henry, it is said, on his death bed had earnestly recommended the prosecution of the war with that country, under the mistaken idea that the Scots would be compelled at the point of the sword to fulfil the treaty of marriage; and Somerset, by one of the first acts of his government, showed a determination to carry this injunction into effect. On the 6th of February, Balnaves repaired to the English court as envoy from the Castilians, and received from the Protector a confirmation of the annuities which had attached to England the conspirators against Beaton. It was resolved to strengthen the garrison of the castle by remitting money for the 1 Lesly, Eannat. Edition p. 193. 31st. March, 1547."], [45, "1547 MARY 13 maintenance of troops. Lesly, one of the assas sins, was commanded to remain at court, to com municate with his friends ; and Balnaves received injunctions, on his return to Scotland, to use his utmost efforts to seduce the nobility from their allegiance to the Governor.1 Somerset at the same time determined to lead an army into Scotland. He addressed a letter to the nobility of that realm, reminding them of the league by which they had bound themselves to assist the late king of England in the accomplishment of his designs, he called upon them for a performance of their promises ; and so successful was Balnaves in his intrigues, that many of the Scottish nobles and barons showed a readiness to repeat the same disgraceful game by which they had enriched themselves under the former reign.2 In the midst of these difficulties which disturbed his government, Arran exerted himself to create a vigorous union against the enemies of the country. Suspicious, from the experience of the former reign, that other designs than a simple matrimonial alliance were contemplated by England, and aware of the preparations for invading the kingdom, he laboured to attach the chief nobility to his service \u2014 to 1 MS.

A Scottish pri vateer, named the Lion, was captured by the Pevensy, an English ship ; in reply to the remonstrances of the Queen Dowager, it was affirmed that the former had been the aggressor,2 and not long after a force of five thousand English broke across the western borders, plundered the country, made prisoner the laird of Johnston with others of his surname, and seized and garrisoned many of the towers upon the marches.3 To repel this aggression, which was loudly complained of as an open declaration of war, Arran assembled an army, advanced rapidly to the borders, stormed and rased the castle of Langhope, and was about to 1 MS.

Nothing could be more welcome than this event. During the armistice, the garrison, notwithstanding the remonstrances of Knox and others who, for conscience' sake, now acted with their party, had abandoned themselves to the most flagrant excesses, ravaging the country, and behaving in a brutal and licentious manner to the poor victims who fell into their hands.2 Trusting to the support of England, they had, on frivolous grounds, refused to abide by their agreement, when the Papal absolution arrived from Rome, and the Governor, convinced that he had been the dupe of a convention which they had never meant to fulfil, was deeply incensed against them. Hastening back, therefore, to the scene of action, he found in the bay a squadron of sixteen armed galleons, commanded by Leo Strozzi, prior of Capua, a knight of Rhodes, of great military experience. The vessels took up their line with much skill, so as at full tide completely to command the outworks towards the sea.

During such preparations, the interior of the castle presented an extraordinary scene. Knox, disgusted by the licentiousness of the garrison, raised his awful voice, and denounced their speedy captivity, as the just judgment of God. To the scoffs of the soldiers, who boasted of the strength of their towers and anticipated assistance from England, he declared that their sins had found them out, that their walls would shiver under the cannon, and their bodies be manacled in foreign prisons. Nor was the sentence of this stern adherent of the truth long- in finding- its accom- plishment. The fortifications which had resisted the ill-directed batteries of the Scottish governor, crumbled under the more effective cannonade of the Italian commander. A breach was soon effected ; a proposal of the garrison for a sortie canvassed and abandoned as hopeless, and within less than a week a flag of truce was seen approaching. It brought from the besieged an offer to surrender, their lives and property being secured ; but the condition was scornfully rejected by the Governor and the Queen. Strozzi declared that it was beyond his commission even to grant them their lives ; and if he did so, it must be with reserva tion that it was afterwards approved of by the King, his master. To this the garrison were compelled to submit. They would acknowledge no lawful authority in Scotland : the Governor, they affirmed, had treacherously betrayed them, and their only"], [49, "1547.

Others, how ever, ascribe its destruction to the zeal of fulfillino* an injunction of the canon law, declaring the vengeance of extermination against any mansion that has witnessed the murder of a cardinal. The booty, which included the personal property of the prelate, amounted in plate, copes, vestments, and jewels of extreme value, to a hundred thousand pounds, a prize 1 Anderson's MS. History, vol. ii. pp. 94, 95. Lesly, p. 194. Anderson says expressly, \"At length he (Strozzi) was content to pardon them their lives, if the king of France should think it good, else to stand to his pleasure.\" Lesly, p. 194, repeats the same terms. Knox, in his History, gives a different account. The heads of the appointment, he affirms, were \u2014 1st, that their lives should be secured to them; 2nd, that they should be safely con veyed to France ; 3rd, that if they chose to embrace the conditions proposed to them by the king of France, they should have their freedom, and be at liberty to enter his service ; 4th, that if they refused, they should be conveyed, at the expense of France, to what country they chose except Scotland. I have preferred the account of the terms of capitulation given in the text, as it appears best supported by the circumstances of the case \u25a0 and it is confirmed not only by Anderson and Lesly, but by Buchanan, Book xv. cap. 45. \u2014 \" Leonti Strozzio, incolumitatem modo pacti, se dediderunt.\" I have been thus particular because an able author has stated that the terms of the capitulation were violated, (Me.

Beaton's death was now amply revenged, and Knox's predictions fulfilled ; for the conspirators and their associates, on arriving in France, were partly distributed in the dungeons of various castles in Brittany ; whilst others, including the reformer himself, were kept chained on board the galleys, and treated with the utmost rigor.1 With this success the Governor was highly grati fied. He already possessed Dumbarton, which the English had in vain attempted to recover ; St. Andrew's, so lately an object of anxiety, and for the occupation of which the Protector was making every effort, had now fallen ; he had been partially suc cessful in his enterprise upon the borders, and could he have succeeded in imparting a spirit of honour and unanimity to the great body of the nobility, there was little reason to be alarmed by the threatened invasion of England. But a discovery was made in the castle which threw a gloom over all his sanguine anticipations. In the chamber of Balnaves, the agent of the Cas tilians, was found a register book which contained the autograph subscriptions of two hundred Scottish noblemen and gentlemen, who had secretly bound themselves to the service of England. Amongst these were the Earls of Bothwell, Cassillis, and Marshall, with Lord Kilmaurs, and Lord Gray. The noted Sir George Douglas, the brother of the Earl of Angus, had, it appeared, sent in his adherence by 1 Lesly, p. 195."], [51, "1547. 19 MAUY. a secret messenger, whilst Bothwell had agreed to give up his castle of the Hermitage, and renounce all allegiance to the Governor, for which good ser vice he was to receive in marriage the Duchess of Suffolk, aunt to the English monarch.1 So much was apparent to the Governor, but other disgraceful transactions were in progress of which he was igno rant ; Lord Gray had not only himself forsaken his country, but was tampering with the Earls of Athol, Errol, Sutherland, and Crawford, whom he found well disposed to declare their mind, provided they were \"honestly entertained.\" He accordingly advised that some money should be given them according to their good deserving.2 Glencairn, at the same time, transmitted to the Protector a secret overture of ser vice, in which he declared himself ready to assist the King of England in the accomplishment of his purposes, to co-operate in the invasion with his friends and vassals, who were favourers of the word of God, and to raise two thousand men who should be ready either to join the army, or keep possession of the counties of Kyle, Cunningham, and Renfrew. He also gave assurances of the devotion of Cassillis and Lennox to the same cause, requested money to equip a troop of horse, with which he would hold the Governor in check till Somerset's arrival, and added directions for the fortification of some \"notable 1 MS.

It was to be expected that such offers would be highly welcome to the English govern- ment, although distrust must have been felt in deal- ing with persons whose oaths had been so repeatedly and unscrupulously violated. Not a year had elapsed since all these noble barons had solemnly given their adherence to the government of Arran, most of them had been appointed members of the Privy Council, they had approved in Parliament of the dissolution of the marriage and peace with England,' and they were now prepared to change sides once more, and promote the purposes of the Protector. Even after such repeated falsehood their overtures were graci ously accepted, and they received a pardon for their desertion of their agreement with the late King*, under condition that they should perform its con ditions in every respect to his son and successor.2 It is material to notice these terms, as they prove on the one hand that, under the cloak of marriage, Edward like his father Henry, concealed a design for the subjugation of Scotland, and on the other, that the party who favoured this project were dis- 1 Acts of the Parliament of Scotland, vol. ii. p. 476 MS.

To defeat machinations which had spread so widely, required a union of resolution and talent which he did not possess : he was aware that the country was on the point of being invaded by the Protector in person \u2014 to have attempted to bring his enemies to justice might have thrown his preparations for resistance into confusion, and spread distrust and dismay throughout the people at a time when vigor and confidence were imperatively re quired. Either he ought to have pretended a total ignorance, silently taking the best measures to defeat the designs of his enemies ; or he should resolutely have seized the chief conspirators ; but Arran unfor tunately adopted that middle course which was sure to lead to a calamitous result. He dissembled for the moment, and delayed all proceedings against the great body of his opponents, but he threw Bothwell into prison, and thus gave an opportunity to his associates of providing for their own safety.2 Yet in the midst of this political irresolution he was not remiss in his military preparations. A line of beacons had been established during the summer upon the hills near the coast, making a chain of com munication from St. Abb's-head to Linlithgow; horse men were kept at each station to carry intelligence, 1 Acts of the Parliament of Scotland, vol. ii. p. 476.\u2014 MS.

The English force consisted in all of fourteen thousand two hundred men, of which four thousand were men at-arms and demi-lances, two thousand light horse, and two hundred Spanish carabineers, mounted. The remaining eight thousand were footmen and pioneers.2 This force was divided into three prin cipal wards or battles. The vanward was led by the Earl of Warwick, a captain of great experience and resolution, who had been bred to arms in the French wars of Henry the Eighth \u2014 the main battle by the Protector in person, and the rear by Lord Dacres of the North, a veteran who still possessed all the fire and vivacity of youth.

We have seen that during the whole of the preceding year, the Scottish Governor had been engaged in war, and being apprehensive that the people, fatigued with perpetual hostilities, might be remiss in obeying his summons, he adopted an expedient for assembling an army, which was seldom used except in cases of imminent peril. He sent the fiery cross throughout the country \u2014 a warlike symbol of Celtic origin, constructed of two slender rods of hazel, formed into the shape of a cross, the extremi ties seared in the fire and extinguished when red and blazing in the blood of a goat, slain for the occasion.

Previous to this, we do not hear of its having been adopted in the lowlands; but on the present emer gency, being fastened to the point of a spear, it was transmitted by the heralds and pursuivants through out every part of the realm ; from town to town, from village to village, from hamlet to hamlet, the ensanguined symbol flew with astonishing rapidity ; and such was its effect, that in a wonderfully short"], [56, "1547. 24 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. space of time an army of thirty-six thousand men assembled near Musselburgh. The Duke of Somerset now entered Scotland, on the 2nd of September, 1547, and without interruption, advanced along the coast, in sight of the English fleet, till he arrived at the defile, then called the Peaths, a deep ravine, over which at the present day is thrown the Pease bridge. It has been well de scribed by Hayward as a \" valley stretching towards the sea si.v miles in length, the banks of which were so steep on either side, that the passage across was not direct, but by paths leading slope-wise, which being many, the place is for that reason called the Peaths, or paths.\"1 It was reported in the English host, that the Scots were here prepared to resist the further advance of the English, and undoubtedly such was the advantage of the ground, that with even a small portion of military skill, a far inferior force might have discomfited their whole army, yet this opportunity was neglected, a circumstance which can only be accounted for by the fact, that most of the proprietors of the country through which the enemy held their march, were attached to the interests of the Protector. We know that in Henry Balnaves's register were the names of two hundred gentlemen, who were under promise to England, and when his army lay at Newcastle, the Protector received a visit from the Laird of Mangertown, and forty barons of 1 Wayward in Kennet, vol. ii_ p. 281."], [57, "1547.

Having employed the greatest part of a day in conducting the army, and dragging the artillery through this rugged pass, the Duke made himself master of the neighbouring castles of Dunglass, Thornton and Innerwick, and leaving Dunbar within a gunshot on his right he pushed forward to Linton, where the army crossed the Tyne by the narrow bridge which still remains, whilst the horsemen and carriages forded the river. Here the enemy neglected another excellent opportunity of attacking the En glish force when defiling across Linton bridge. They contented themselves with pushing forward some of their prickers, or light horse, under Dandy Car, a noted borderer, whose little squadron was put to flight by a charge led by Lord Warwick. Advancing past Hailes Castle, which opened upon them an ineffectual cannonade, they proceeded, on the 7th of September, to Long Niddry, where they encamped for the night.2 Here the Protector communicating by signal with his fleet which lay near Leith, Lord Clinton, the admiral, came ashore, and after a con ference it was resolved that the larger ships should leave the road at Leith, and cast anchor beside Musselburo-h, whilst the transports and victuallers should beat in as near as possible to the shore. ' Patten's Expedition, p. 27- s Patten, p. 42."], [58, "1547- 26 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. The English were now aware that the Scottish army lay beside Musselburgh, and during the march of the succeeding day there were generally in view some small bodies of their light cavalry, which kept galloping backwards and forwards on the eminences overhanging- their line of march. On September the 8th, the Protector halted for the night and encamped near a town, called Salt Preston, now Preston Pans, within view of she enemy's camp, at Edmonstone Edge, about three miles distant, \u2014 on his right to the north was the Firth, and towards the south, not far distant, rose the hill of Faside. Upon the long elevated ridges which formed the roots of the hill, the Scottish cavalry showed themselves early next morning, and approached the English vanguard, whooping, shaking their lances, and attempting to provoke them to an onset. They formed a force of one thousand five hundred light horse, led by Lord Hume, and near them lay in ambush a body of five hundred foot. Somerset, however, from the forwardness of these prickers, suspected that they reckoned on some nearer support than was discernible, and gave strict orders to his men to preserve their ranks ; but Lord Grey impatient of such provocation, extorted leave to try the effect of a charge : accordingly as soon as they came \" scattered on the spur, \" within a stone cast of the English, and after their usual shouting were beginning to wheel about, Grey with his demi-lances, and a thousand men at arms, charged them at full speed, upon which they faced about, and firmly received his onset. The"], [59, "1547 MARY 27 weight of the men-at-arms, however, and their barbed steeds, was an overmatch for the slight, though hardy hackneys of the borderers, and after maintaining the conflict for three hours, they were entirely broken, and the greatest part of them cut to pieces. The chase continued for three miles, from Faside hill to the right wing of their army which lay to the south ; in this unfortunate affair thirteen hundred men were slain within sight of their camp, Lord Hume was severely wounded, his son, the master of Hume, taken prisoner, and the whole body of the Scottish cavalry nearly destroyed, a loss seriously felt in the next day's battle.1 After this success the Protector, accompanied by a small party, descended from Faside hill, by a lane which led directly north, to the church of Inveresk. His object was to examine the position occupied by the Scots, and he was enabled to do so effectually, as the course he took ran almost parallel to their camp, which he could see distinctly. Nothing could be better chosen for strength and security, than the ground whereon they lay, defended on the right by a morass which stretched towards the south, on the left by the Firth, and in front looking eastward by the river Esk, which took its course between them and the enemy. Over this river, to the north and near the Firth, was the bridge of Musselburgh, upon which they had placed their ordnance, so that it was evident to the English commander, upon a slight in- 1 Patten, pp. 46, 47.

Somerset, however, did not fail to observe, that their camp was partially com manded by the hill of Inveresk, and by the higher parts of the lane which led from Faside hill, and having resolved to occupy these places with his ordnance, with the object of forcing them to dislodge from their strong ground, he rode back to his own camp. On the road he was overtaken by a Scottish herald, with his tabard on, accompanied by a trumpet, who brought a message from the Governor. The herald said his first errand was for an exchange of prisoners, his second to declare, that his master, eager to avoid the effusion of Christian blood, was willing to allow him to retreat without molestation, and upon honor able conditions. The trumpeter next addressed the Duke informing him that, in case such terms were not accepted, his master, the Earl of Huntly, willing to bring the quarrel to a speedy conclusion, was ready to encounter him twenty to twenty, ten to ten, or, if he would so far honor him, man to man. To these messages Somerset made a brief and temperate reply. He declared, turning to the herald, that his coming into Scotland had been at the first to seek peace, and to obtain such terms as should be for the good of either realm. His quarrel he added was just, he trusted, therefore, God would prosper it ; and since the Governor had already rejected such conditions as would never again be proffered, he must look now to"], [61, "1547 MARY 29 its being decided by arms ; \" and as for thy master,\" said he, addressing the trumpeter, \" he lacketh some discretion to send his challenge to one, who, by reason of the weightycharge he bears (no less than the government of a king's person and the protection of his realm,) hath no power to accept it; \u2014 whilst there are yet many noble gentlemen here, his equals in rank, to whom he might have addressed his cartel, without fear of a refusal.\" At this moment the Earl of Warwick broke eagerly in, telling the messenger that he would not only accept the challenge, but would give him a hundred crowns if he brought back his master's consent.1 \"Nay,\" said Somerset, \"Huntly is not equal in rank to your lordship \u2014 but herald, tell the Governor, and the Earl of Huntly also, that we have now spent some time in your country, our force is but a small company \u2014 yours far exceeds us, yet bring me word they will meet us in a plain field, and thou shalt have a thousand crowns for thy pains, and thy masters fighting enough.\" The herald and his companion were then dis missed, and the Protector pursued his way to the camp, where, after a consultation with his officers, it was thought proper notwithstanding the challenge so lately given, to make a final effort to avert hostilities. A letter was accordingly addressed to the Governor, in which Somerset declared his readiness to retreat from the kingdom on the single condition, that the Scots would consent to keep their youthful queen in 1 Patten, pp. 49, 50."], [62, "1547. 30 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. her own country, unfettered by any agreement with the French government, until she had reached a marriageable age, and was able to say for herself, whether she would abide by the matrimonial treaty with England. Had such moderate and equitable proposals been made previous to the declaration of hostilities, they would probably have been accepted ; but coming at so questionable a moment, they appeared to the Governor to be dictated rather by a conviction in the Protector, that he could no longer support his army in an enemy's country, than by any real love of peace. On showing the letter to Hamilton, Arch bishop of St. Andrew's, who was much in his con fidence, he expressed the same opinion, and it was agreed to suppress the communication entirely, whilst a report was spread that an insulting, instead of a conciliatory message had been transmitted, requiring the Scots to deliver up their queen, and submit themselves to the mercy of their enemy.1 Such being the result of this last attempt, nothing was left to either party but an appeal to arms, and early on the morning of the 10th of September, the Duke of Somerset broke up his camp, and gave orders for the army to advance towards the hill of Inveresk, his design being to encamp near that spot, and to plant his ordnance on the eminence command ing the Scottish position : this movement was no sooner perceived by the Scottish governor, than he embraced the extravagant idea that the Protector had 1 Hay ward in Kennet, vol. ii, p. 283."], [63, "1547 31 MARY commenced his retreat towards his fleet, which had removed two days before from Leith, and now lay in Musselburgh bay, with the design of embarking his army. He instantly resolved to anticipate him by throwing himself between the English and their ships, and disregarding the advice of his best officers, who earnestly recommended him to keep his strong posi tion till, at least, the demonstrations of the enemy became more definite, he gave orders for the whole army to dislodge and pass the river.1 Angus who led the vanward, deeming it madnessto throw away their advantage, refused to obey; but being charged on pain of treason to pass forward, he forded the river, and was followed, although after some delay, by the Governor, who led the main battle, and the Earl of Huntly with his northland men who formed the rear. The advance mustered ten thousand strong, embrac ing the strength of Fife, Merns, Angus and the West Country ; it was flanked on the right by some pieces of artillery drawn by men, and on the left by four hundred light horse; it included also a large body of priests and monks, who marched under a white banner, on which was painted a female kneeling before a crucifix, her hair dishevelled, and, embroi dered underneath, the motto \" Afflict\u00e6 Ecclesi\u00e6 ne obliviscaris.'' 2 In the main battle was the power of Lothian, Fife, Strathern, Stirlingshire, and the great body of the 1 Maitland, vol. ii. p. 874.

This movement of the Scots in abandoning their advantage, and crossing the river, was viewed with equal astonishment and pleasure by the English commander. He had dislodged from his camp, and commenced his march at eight in the morning, and before he was half way to Inveresk, the enemy having surmounted the hill, were seen advancing towards the English. Somerset, and the Earl of Warwick, who happened to be riding together at this moment, instantly perceived their advantage, thanked God for the fortunate event, ordered forward their artillery, and taking* a joyful leave of each other, proceeded to their respective charges, the former to the vanward, and the Duke to the main battle, where was the king's standard. \" Warwick immediately arranged his divi sion upon the side of the hill ; the Protector formed his battle chiefly on the hill, but his extreme right rested on the plain ; the rear, under Lord Dacres, 1 Pitscottie by Dalzel, vol. ii. p. 496. 3 Hayward in Kennet, vol. ii. p. 284."], [65, "1547. 33 MARY. were drawn up wholly on the plain, whilst Lord Grey, with the men-at arms and the mounted carabineers, were stationed at some distance on the extreme left. His orders were to take the enemy in flank, yet he was strictly interdicted from making any attack till the foot of the vanward were engaged with the enemy, and the main battle was near at hand for his support. By the time these arrangements were completed, the Scots were considerably advanced, their object being to throw themselves between the English and their fleet; but in accomplishing this, the wing of their rearward, which moved nearest to the Firth, found themselves exposed to the fire of one of the English galleys, which galled them severely, slew the Master of Graham, with some others who were beside him, and threw Argile's Highlandmen into disorder.1 Checked in this manner, their army fell back from the ground which was thus exposed, and declining to the south ward, took a direct line towards the west end of the Faside-hill. 2 Their object was to win this side of the hill, and availing themselves of the advantage to attack the enemy from the higher ground ; but as soon as the Protector perceived this movement, he commanded Lord Grey mid Sir Ralph Vane, with the veteran bands of the men-at-arms, called Bulleners, 3 and the demi-lances under Lord Fitzwaters, to charge 1 This fact is stated both in the English and Scottish accounts of the battle, but in walking over the field, I found it extremely difficult to account for it.\u2014 See Patten, p. 55. 2 Patten, p. 55. 3 From their having been employed as the garrison at Boulogne.

This man\u0153uvre, although aware of its perilous nature, was executed by Lord Grey with the utmost readiness and gallantry. Observing the Scottish in fantry advancing at so round a pace, that many deemed them to be rather cavalry than foot,1 he waited for a short space, till Lord Warwick was pretty well up with the enemy, and then, commanding the trumpets to sound, charged down the hill at full gallop, right against the left wing of Angus's division. The shock at first was dreadful, but the superiority of infantry over cavalry was soon evinced. The Scottish foot were armed with spears eighteen feet in length, far exceeding that of the lances of the men at-arms, and they knew well how to avail them selves of this advantage. Angus, on observing the intention of the English, had commanded his men to form in that formidable order which had often effectually resisted the chivalry of England. Nothing could be more simple, but. nothing more effective. The soldiers closed inwards, so near as to appear locked together shoulder to shoulder. The front line stooped low and almost knelt, placing the butt-end of their pike against the right foot, grasp ing it firmly with both hands, and inclining its steel point breast high against the enemy; the second 1 Patten, p. 56."], [67, "1547. iMARY. 35 rank crossed their pikes over their shoulders, the third assumed the same position, and so on to whatever depth the column might be, giving it the appearance of a gigantic hedge-hog covered with an impenetrable skin of steel bristles.1 Against such a body, if the men stood firm, the finest cavalry in the world could not make any serious impression. It happened, also, that a broad muddy ditch or slough lay between the English and the Scottish foot, into which the horses plunged up to the counter, and with great difficulty cleared it. Yet, undismayed by these adverse cir cumstances, Lord Grey, heading his men-at-arms, struggled through, and with his front companies charged full upon the enemy's left. No human force, however, could break the wall against which he had thrown himself, and in an incredibly short time two hundred saddles were emptied, the horses being stabbed in the belly with the spears, and the riders who had fallen, speedily dispatched by the whingers or short double-edged daggers, which the Scots carried at their girdle. Such was the fate of Shelly, Ratcliff, Clarence, Preston, and other brave and veteran commanders of the Bulleners. Flammock, who carried the English standard, saved the colours, but left the staff in the hands of the enemy.2 Lord Grey himself was dangerously hurt in the mouth and neck. Many horses, furious from their wounds, and 1 So that it were as easy, to use the words of an eye-witness, for a bare finger to pierce the skin of an angry hedge-hog, as for any one to encounter the brunt of their pikes. \u2014 Patten, p. 59- Lord Herries1 Memoirs, p. 20.

At this critical moment, had Angus been supported by the rest of the army, or had the Scots possessed any body of men at-arms, who by a timely charge might have improved their advantage, the English would in all probability have been undone.1 But the cavalry had been nearly cut to pieces in the action of the day before, and the centre and rear under the Governor and Huntly were still at a considerable distance; the vanward, therefore, unable to pursue the fugitives, and not choosing to advance against the main body of the enemy till certain of support, halted for a brief space. The opportunity was thus lost, and the Earl of War wick, aware of the infinite value of a few minutes gained at such a juncture, galloped through the wavering ranks of the advance, re-established their order, disengaged the men-at-arms from the infantry, and rallying them, with the assistance of Sir Ralph Saddler, pushed forward the company of the Spanish carabineers. These fine troops, armed both man and horse in complete mail, galloped up to the brink of the broad ditch, and coming* within half-musket range 1 Hayward, p. 284.

This attack was seconded by Sir Peter Mewtas, who brought up his foot hacbutteers : the archers now moving rapidly forward discharged a flight of arrows, and at the same moment the artillery, which had been judiciously placed on the hill, were made to bear upon Angus's division, who, dreading the effect of so complicated an attack, began to fall back, though in good order, to the main battle. At this instant the Highlanders, who, unable to resist their plundering propensities, were dispersed over the field, stripping the slain, mistook this retrograde movement for a flight, and seized with a sudden panic began to run off in all directions. Their terror communicated itself to the borough troops : these formed a main portion of the centre, and starting from their ranks, although still a quarter of a mile distant from the enemy, they threw away their weapons, and followed the Highlanders. In the midst of this shameful confusion, the Governor, instead of exerting himself to rally the fugitives, shouted treason, a cry which only increased the disorder. The Earl of War wick meanwhile was coming fast forward, the horse men once more showed themselves ready to charge, and the English centre and rear hastened on at an accelerated pace. Had the Scottish vanward been certain that support was near at hand, they might, even alone, have withstood this formidable attack ; but, deserted by the rest of the army, they did not choose to sacrifice themselves ; and the body which so lately had opposed an impenetrable front to the enemy"], [70, "1547. 38 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. beginning first to undulate to and fro like a steely sea, ao-itated by the wind, after a few moments was seen breaking into a thousand fragments and dispersed in all directions: every thing was now lost, the ground over which the flight lay was as thickly strewed with pikes as a floor with rushes ; helmets, bucklers, swords, daggers, and steel caps lay scat tered on every side, cast away by their owners, as impeding their speed, and the chase beginning at one o'clock continued till six in the evening with extraordinary slaughter. The English demi-lances and men-at-arms, irritated by their late defeat, hast ened after the fugitives with a speed heightened by revenge1, and passing across the field of their late action, were doubly exasperated by seeing the bodies of their brave companions stript by the Highlanders lying all naked and mangled before their eyes. Crying to one another to remember Panierheugh, the spot where Sir Ralph Evre and his company had in the former year been cut to pieces by the Earl of Angus, they spurred at the top of their speed after the fugitives, cutting them down on all sides, and admitting none to quarter, but those from whom they hoped for a heavy ransom. The Scots fled in three several ways, some straight upon Edinburgh, some along the coast to Leith, but the most part towards Dalkeith, with the object of throwing the morass, which had de fended the right of their camp, between them and their pursuers.? Yet this proved so ineffectual a security, that, before the chase was ended, fourteen 1 Patten, p. 66. - Ibid."], [71, "1547 MARY 39 thousand were slain, the river running red with blood, and the ground for five miles in distance and four in breadth being covered, says an eye-witness, as thick with dead bodies, as cattle in a well -stocked pasture field.1 It was recorded, that in Edinburgh alone this day's battle made three hundred and sixty widows.2 Little pity was shown to the priests, multitudes of whom were slain,3 and mingled amongst the corpses of common soldiers, whilst their sacred banner lay trampled under foot and soiled with blood. The evening was now advancing to night, the pursuit had lasted for five hours, and the Protector causing a retreat to be sounded, the army mustered again on the ridge of Edmonstone Edge, beside the Scottish tents, where joyous at their victory, they gave a long loud shout, which, as they afterwards were told, was so shrill and piercing, that it was heard in the streets of the capital.4 This great defeat, named from the adjoining fields the battle of Pinky, if immediately followed up by Somerset, might have led to results most fatal to Scotland. Had he pursued the fugitive Governor to Stirling, where the young Queen was kept, made himself master of its castle, which could not have held out long against such a force as he commanded, occupied Edinburgh, seized and fortified the town and harbour of Leith, and after leaving a garrison to defend it, taken his progress through the country, and offered a general protection to the Scots, the 1 Patten, p. 67 2 Herries' Memoirs, p. 21.

But providentially for Scotland, the Protector at this moment received information of secret plots against him in England ; and he resolved to hurry home, that he might confront and defeat his enemies. His measures, in consequence of this abrupt decision, were confused and ill-digested. Their cruelty alienated the minds of the people, and their impolicy shook the confidence of the Scottish barons who had at- tached themselves to his service. Advancing from Edgebuckling Bray, where he had encamped after the battle, to Leith, he quartered his horse in the town, ravaged the neighbouring* country, received the submission of the Earl of Bothwell, whom he released from prison,1 burnt Kinghorn, with some petty fishing ports upon the coast of Fife, and garri- soned a deserted monastery upon Inch Colm, a small island in the Firth. He next spoiled the Abbey of Holyrood, from which he tore off the leaden roof, set fire to Leith, and having remained no longer than a week, commenced his retreat on the 18th of Sept., 1547.c The fleet at the same time weighed anchor, and in their passage homeward took possession of the strong castle of Broughty, situated at the mouth of the Tay, which by the treachery of Lord Gray, its owner, was, on the first summons, delivered to the enemy.3 It was newly fortified and garrisoned, after 1 Anderson, MS.

During the retreat of Somerset through Merse and Teviotdale he received the submission of the chief men of these districts, who swore fealty to King Edward, and surrendered their castles to the Pro tector. Amongst these were the Lairds of Cessford, Fernihirst, Ormeston, Mellerstain, and many others. He then seized and garrisoned the strong castle of Hume, and repaired Roxburgh, building a new fort upon the site of the old castle. For the speedy com pletion of this he was so earnest, that he put his own hand to the spade and shovel, encouraging his lords and officers to the like exertions, so that within a few days it was ready to receive a garrison.1 While still at this place intelligence reached the army of the success of the Earl of Lennox and Lord Wharton, who, two days before the battle, had entered Scotland by the west marches at the head of a body of five thousand men. The object was to create a diversion in these parts, and prevent them from sending their force to join the main army of Scotland. In this inroad they took Castlemilk, giving it in charge to Sir Edward Dudley, wasted the country with fire and sword, and razed to the ground the town of Annan, blowing up the church and steeple, where a brave officer named Lyon, with the Master of Maxwell, and the Lairds of Johnston ' Anderson, MS.

The cruelty of the slaughter at Pinky, and the subsequent severities at Leith, excited universal indignation; and the idea that a free country was to be compelled into a pacific matrimonial alliance, amid the groans of its dying citizens and the flames of its sea-ports, was revolting and absurd. The Queen Mother, a woman of much spirit and political talent, seized the oppor tunity to infuse vigour and decision into the national councils. Meeting the Governor, who immediately after his defeat had hurried to Stirling, she assembled the nobility around her, and proposed that a new army should be levied, whilst ambassadors should be despatched to France, with a request for instant assistance. As the enemy still occupied Leith, the infant Queen for the sake of security was con veyed from Stirling to the monastery of Inchmahome, situated in a little island in the Lake of Men teith, where she remained with her governors Lords ] Anderson MS.

D'Osell. the French ambassador, assured the nobility that no more likely method could be adopted to secure the speedy assistance of his master ; and finding the proposal agreeable to them, the Queen Mother suggested that the French Dauphin, under the circumstances in which the kingdom was now placed, would be an infinitely more appropriate match for their Queen, when she arrived at a marriageable age, than the English monarch, whose hand had been so rudely forced upon her. This scheme could not fail to be disagreeable to Arran the Governor, who had designed her for his own son ; but his influence was on the wane, and although nothing definitive was settled, the ambassadors to the French Court were permitted to sound the inclinations of Henry the Second, who eagerly embraced the overture.2 Although the resolute measures adopted by the Queen Dowager, and the retreat of Somerset, sup- \u00bb Lesly, Bannat.

The land was shamefully deserted by the greater part of its nobility. The Earls of Angus, Glencairn, Cassillis, and Lennox, the Lords Maxwell, Boyd, Gray, and Cranston, the Lairds of Ormeston and Brunston, with many other barons, had entered the service of England, given hostages for their fidelity, and sworn to secret articles which bound them to obey the orders of the Protector.1 On the side of the Queen, indeed, Argile, at this time one of the most powerful barons in Scotland, had advanced (Jan. 1547-8) at the head of a large force to Dundee, with the determination of making* himself master of Broughty Castle, and compelling the English to abandon that part of the country.'-' A seasonable bribe, however, of one thousand crowns caused an im mediate and discreditable change of purpose, and imitating the example of his brethren, he embraced the service of England and retired from Dundee,3 (5th Feb., 1547-8).

By superiority of numbers, however, he was driven back through a postern. The English gained the base court after a desperate struggle, in which forty of the Scots were slain, and Wilford was proceeding to undermine and blow up the walls, when the garrison yielded without conditions. Much wealth was found in the place, as, according to Gray's account, \" all the country had brought their goods together, thinking that nothing could prevail against George's policy.1 He himself escaped, but his wife, his eldest son, the Master of Morton, afterwards Regent ; the Abbot of Arbroath, a natural son of Angus, Home the Laird of Wedderburn, and many of the Douglasses, fell into the hands of the enemy. To be thus overreached and entrapped in his own devices was peculiarly mortifying to this long-practised intriguer, and seems to have sunk deeper into his spirit than the loss either of his wife or his castle.

At such a time, therefore, it was with no ordinary feelings upon the part not only of the Queen Mother and her friends, but of the nation, that a French fleet was seen to enter the Firth, and an army of six thousand foreign troops soon after disembarked at Leith (16th June).3 It was commanded by Andrew de Montalembert, Sieur D'Esse, an experienced officer, and, besides an excellent train of artillery, included three thousand Germans under the lihinegrave, and a body of Italians led by Leo Strozzi.

He declared he was ready, in addition to the army now sent, to grant them every further aid that might be necessary, in troops, money, and arms, and he concluded by expressing the anxiety of the French monarch that the league which for so many centuries had bound the nations to each other, should now be further strengthened by a marriage between his son, the Dauphin, and their youthful Queen,1 whose education, if they would commit her to his charge, he would superintend with the utmost care and affection. To these proposals the Scottish parliament unanimously agreed, under the single condition that the French monarch should solemnly promise to preserve the laws and liberty of the realm of Scotland, as they had existed under the race of her own kino-s. Measures were immediately adopted for the passage of the infant Queen to France, and as it was known that the Protector, aware of the design, had sent Clinton with a fleet to intercept her, great caution was necessary. Monsieur Villegagnon, with four galleys, weighing anchor from Leith, pretended to sail for France, but on clearing the mouth of the Firth, he changed his course, and passing through the Pentland Firth round 1 Acts of the Parliament of Scotland, vol. ii. pp. 481, 482."], [85, "1548 53 MARY Scotland, came before Dumbarton,1 where the Queen awaited his arrival.

He required him, therefore, to abstain from all hostilities against that country, and promised that a like cessation should be observed by the Scots.1 It was not to be expected that this intimation should produce any effect, and the war continued with equal animosity as before, but at first the suc- cess was on the side of England. Haddington held out against every effort of the foreign troops, and although a body of one thousand five hundred English horse who escorted a supply of ammunition, were defeated with great slaughter, such was the bravery of the garrison under Sir John Wilford, that the siege was first turned into a blockade, and afterwards aban- doned on the approach of the Earl of Shrewsbury at the head of an army of twenty-two thousand men. To co-operate with the land troops, a fleet under Lord Clinton appeared in the Firth, and making a descent at St. Monan, on the coast of Fife were encountered and defeated with great slaughter by the Lord James, lately returned from France,2 who, on the first intelligence of danger, had mustered the strength of Fife, and here first gave a proof of that cool and determined character which afterwards raised him to such a height of power.3 To balance this success, however, Haddington was 1 Memoires D'Estat, par Ribier, ii. p. 152.

The war, too, assumed a character of more than common ferocity. The Scots, not contented with the slaughter of the cap tives who fell into their hands, purchased their Eng lish prisoners from the French, that they might have the gratification of subjecting them to the most inge nious and protracted kinds of death. Of such excesses, disgraceful as they undoubtedly were, the causes were to be found in the conduct of the English themselves. The cruel slaughter at Pinky,3 the burning of their sea ports and shipping, the destruction of their har vest, and the pitiless severity with which the repeated invasions of the country had been accompanied, had at length animated the Scots with a univer sal feeling of revenge, which manifested itself in the most shocking excesses : one example of such scenes may be given as illustrating the times.

Siege was laid to it by the Scottish and foreign troops ; the base court was gained, the English archers were driven by the fire of the hacbutteers into the keep, and the engineers had effected a breach in the inner wall, when the commander, afraid of falling* into the hands of the Scots, stole forth, and surrendered to the Sieur D'Esse, imploring his protection ; but it was in vain, a borderer beholding in him the brutal ravisher of his wife, broke through every impediment, and ere his arm could be arrested, at one blow carried his head four paces from his body.1 The English had repaired and garrisoned the ruinous for tress of Roxburgh immediately subsequent to the battle of Pinky ; the chiefs on the east border had sworn allegiance to the Protector, and the west borderers submitted universally to Lord Wharton, but the submission which had been extorted by fear was, on the first success of the foreign troops, exchanged for the bitterest hostility, and in a short space of time, the country which had been occupied by the enemy was wrested from their hands. The castle of Hume was retaken, the governor of Haddington, Sir John Wilford, made prisoner, and the party he command ed entirely defeated; the German garrison, which had been left in Coldingham, were cut to pieces, the enemy 1 Lesly, p. 224."], [89, "1549 57 MARY. expelled from their fortifications in Inch Keith,the im portant strength of Fascastle recovered by stratagem, and the English at length compelled to abandon Had dington, the defence of which had cost them so much blood and treasure.1 But the employment of foreign troops generally brings some calamity along with it : if successful, they insist on a monopoly of the glory ; if defeated, they throw the blame upon their employ ers, and in either case jealousy and heartburnings arise. These causes seem to have operated to their full extent during* the campaigns of the French in Scotland, and at last broke out in a tumult in the capital, which was only appeased after the death of the Laird of Stenhouse, the Provost, and the slaughter of many of the citizens.2 In the course of these transactions a reinforce ment of a thousand foot and three hundred horse arrived from France, (June 23, 1549,) under the command of De Thermes, an experienced officer, who prosecuted the war with such vigor and ability that the English were every where defeated, and compelled at last to surrender the castle of Broughty, their strongest remaining fortress in Scot land.3 Having obtained this advantage, the Go vernor laid sieo-e to Lauder, and in a successful attack, had already driven the enemy into the inner court, when intelligence was brought that peace had been concluded at Boulogne between France and England, upon which hostilities were immediately 1 Diurnal of Occurrents, p. 49.

The English agreed to evacuate Scotland ; to de molish the forts which they had raised at Dunglass, Roxburgh, and Eymouth, to surrender Lauder, and to abstain from any invasion, unless upon some new provocation.2 To these conditions the Governor lost no time in giving in his adherence, sending the Master of Erskine as his Ambassador into France for that purpose, and peace was proclaimed at Edin burgh, in the month of April, 1550.' Thus after a war of nine years were the English obliged to abandon their extravagant projects of compelling the Scots by force of arms into a matri monial alliance.

She had long been dissatisfied with the conduct of the Governor, and instigated alike by her own ambition and the advice of her brothers, the Duke of Guise and the Cardinal Lorrain, she formed the bold design of supplanting him in the possession of the supreme power. To accomplish this by force was impossible. Towards the conclusion of the war the people and the nobles became jealous of the French auxiliaries,1 the feeling was increased by the obligations which they owed to them, and the slightest appearance of compulsion employed towards Arran would have roused a spirit of uni versal opposition. Mary of Guise determined to gain her purpose by the more artful weapons of intrigue and bribery.

She was accompanied by De Thermes, La Chapelle, and other French officers, and by some of the prin- cipal nobility of Scotland, amongst whom were the Earls of Huntly, Cassillis, Sutherland, and Marshall, the Lords Home, Fleming, and Maxwell, with the Prelates of Caithness and Galloway.1 Landing at Dieppe (19 September, 1550,) they immediately proceeded to Rouen, where the court was then held, and were received with much distinction.2 Amidst the festivities which welcomed her arrival,3 Mary of Guise explained her graver schemes against Arran to the French Cabinet, and found them warmly encouraged by the Cardinal of Lorrain and the Duke of Guise .

They contended that on the success of such a plan depended the preservation of the French influence and of the Romish religion in Scotland. If the first failed, the other, they said, must inevitably decay; and it was to be feared, from the great progress already made by heresy in that country, that a reformation would be established in Scotland, similar to that which had taken place in its sister kingdom. On the contrary, if the pre eminence of French councils could be secured all would go well, and Ireland, which was universally ripe for insurrection, would throw off her allegiance, and needed but a token from France to be wholly at her devotion.1 Nor was this last a vain boast. The archbishop of Armagh, a busy envoy of the papal government, who had been sent into that country with a commis sion to encourage a revolt against England, had arrived at the French Court soon after the Queen Dowager, and, after giving an encouraging descrip tion of the universal discontent which prevailed in that unhappy country, proceeded to Rome.2 1 MS.

Convinced by such arguments, Henry declared his satisfaction with the projects of the Queen Mother, and Panter, Bishop of Ross, the Scottish ambassador at the Court of France, with Sir Robert Carnegy and Hamilton, Abbot of Kilwinning, repaired to Scot land for the purpose of breaking the affair to the Regent. This they did in an artful manner. They represented to him the dilapidation of the revenue and the crown-lands which had taken place during* his government, the rigid reckoning to which he must be called when the young Queen came of age, and the impossibility of obtaining an honourable dis charge, if he remained in his dangerous elevation. On the other hand, they held out the splendid bribe of the Dukedom of Chastelherault for himself, and an establishment at the French Court for his eldest son, if he agreed to resign the government ; whilst they strengthened the party of the Queen Mother by liberal promises to the Scottish nobles.1 It hap pened that at this moment the Governor was de prived of the counsels of the Archbishop of St. Andrew's, who then lay on what was supposed a death-bed. The influence of a talented and deter mined opponent was thus removed, and Arran left to himself gave a reluctant and conditional assent.2 Having so far succeeded, Mary of Guise took leave 1 Lesly. p. 237.

It evinced her resolution to preserve pacific relations with this country, and formed part of that system of universal conciliation which for the present she had deter mined to maintain. Some time before this the Master of Erskine, and Sinclair, the president of the Session, had proceeded on an embassy to Flanders, where they concluded a peace with the Emperor,2 and tranquillity being thus established abroad, the Queen on her return to Scotland devoted her undivided energy to the composition of all differ ences amongst the nobility, and the establishment of order and good government. Injustice to Arran, the Regent, it ought to be stated, that during her absence in France he had exerted himself to accommodate those border differences which had ever been so fertile a cause of exasperation, and in a convention signed by commissioners of both kingdoms at Norham, some wise regulations were introduced for the determination of the boundaries, the tranquillity of the Debateable Land, and the security of the com mercial intercourse between the two countries.3 1 Anderson, MS.

Nor was this all, two parliaments were held at Edinburgh, in the spring and the winter of the year 1551, in which, amid much of that rude and narrow legislation which marks the age, some salutary laws were introduced. A vain attempt was made to fix the prices of wine and of provisions, and repress the inordinate luxury of the table.1 An enactment was passed against the sins affirmed to be scandalously common \u2014 of adultery, bigamy, blasphemous swear ing, and indecent behaviour during public worship; and the press, which it is declared had teemed with lewd rhymes and ballads, with scandalous songs and tragedies, was subjected to the censorship of an ordinary, and restricted by a law, which compelled every printer to obtain a licence from the Queen and the Governor.2 Subsequently to this, Arran took his progress through the northern parts of the kingdom, holding justice courts in the principal towns, and proceeded afterwards, accompanied by the Queen Regent, to visit for the same purpose the western and southern districts of the realm.

To compose this rude state of things required a union of energy and address which might have been deemed beyond the abilities of Arran, but his exertions were seconded by the Queen Mother, who bent all her efforts to the task, and it says much for her talent, temper, and good sense, that the measures which she adopted, were success ful. The clergy were satisfied, the nobles reconciled amongst themselves, the lower orders induced, rather than compelled, to respect the laws, and Mary of Guise, by her prudence, and popular manners, so firmly attached all orders to her party, that the Governor began to dread he would be universally deserted.1 This moment was artfully seized by her to remind Arran that it was now time for him to fulfil his promise, and resign the regency in her favour, but she met with an indignant refusal. He declared his resolution to retain the high office, which belonged to his rank as nearest heir to the Crown, insisted that no such overtures could be entertained till the young Queen had at least reached the age of twelve years, and so deeply resented the proposal, that he remained in Edinburgh with the few lords who still embraced his party, 1 Lesly, p. 245.

These proud and resentful feelings, so opposite to the sentiments which he had expressed in 1551, were supposed to be instilled into the mind of Arran by his brother, the Primate of St. Andrew's, who had now recovered his health, and with2 it his influence over the easy temper of his relative. A determined opposition was thus re-organized against the Queen Mother, the Archbishop represented to his brother the madness of retiring from the supreme power, when nothing stood between him and the Crown but the feeble life of a girl,3 and nearly a year was spent in mutual crimination and intrigue.

She at the same time procured the young Queen her daughter to select as her guardians the King of France, with her uncles, the Cardinal Lorrain and the Duke of Guise. They again devolved their authority upon the Queen Dowager, and although Arran pleaded justly that the transaction was illegal, the young Mary being still in her minority, the objection was overruled, and he at last reluctantly consented to his abdica tion. A Parliament accordingly assembled at Edin burgh, on the 12th of April, 1554, in which this solemn transaction was completed. The various instruments of agreement which had been entered into with Arran were first produced. They con ferred on him the Dutchy of Chastelherault, and gave him an ample approval of the mode in which he had managed, and the purposes to which he had applied the revenue of the Crown.

But the possession of power is a trying and dangerous thing to the best. She had incurred many obligations to the court of France, which her gratitude or her promises impelled her to repay, by intruding foreigners into the offices hitherto filled by natives ; and, unmindful of the extraordinary jealousy with which the Scottish people were disposed to regard all interference of this kind, she lent herself to measures dictated more by the ambition of the house of Guise, than by a desire to promote the happiness of her daughter's kingdom. Her first act went far to disgust the nobility and the people. Huntly, the chancellor,2 although per- 1 Lesly, pp. 241, 242. MS.

Villemore was made comptroller, a place of high responsibility ; and D'Osel, although placed in no office, became her confidential adviser in all matters of state.1 These imprudent preferments ex cited a dissatisfaction, which, was indeed smothered for the time, but afterwards broke out with fatal force against the Regent. In the mean time the kingdom became disturbed in the north, where the fierce and powerful sept of the clan Ranald, under their leader John Mudyard, resumed their career of misrule and spoliation. The general policy hitherto pursued in these districts, was that introduced by James the Fourth. It was the practice of this monarch to keep the various clans in subordination by encouraging their mutual rivalry, and employing them as checks upon each other. In the event of any sept rising into a dangerous pre-eminence, or, as was not unusual, into open rebellion, one of the most powerful northern nobles, as Athole, Huntly, or Argile, was entrusted with a commission of lieutenancy, and, on repairing to the disturbed districts with an armed force, they engaged some of the rival clans to assist in putting down the insurrection. There can be no doubt that such commissions, of which the powers were indefinite, 1 Keith's Eccl. Hist. pp. 69, 70. Lesly, pp. 250, 251. Ander son's MS. Hist. vol. ii. page 17^ dorso."], [104, "1554. 72 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. had been often abused to the purposes of individual ambition. The great lords looked for forfeitures of the lands of the highland chiefs, to reward themselves and their followers; and, on many occasions, rather encouraged treason than promoted submission. It was a consequence of this miserable system that these chiefs continued in rebellion, not so much from any unwillingness to acknowledge the authority of the government, as from a dread of the influence and misrepresentations of their enemies. In 155*2, when the Regent Arran and the Queen Dowager held their court at Inverness, John Mudyard, the leader of the clan Ranald, had treated with proud contempt their summons to appear before them ; and although Argile afterwards promised to compel his attendance, or to expose him to the extremity of fire and sword, he appears to have eluded both the promise and the penalty. In 1554, he and his adherents once more bid defiance to the govern ment ; and Huntly, armed with a commission of lieutenancy, and leading an army chiefly composed of lowland barons, proceeded against him as far as Abertarff in Invernesshire. His attempt, however, was singularly unsuccessful ; for when it became necessary to pursue the daring outlaw into his moun tain fastnesses, his lowland leaders declined acting in a country unsuited for cavalry, whilst his highland auxiliaries reproached him for the execution of Mackintosh, captain of the clan Chattan,1 and showed 1 Lesly, p. 251, 252. Maitland, vol. ii. p. 893."], [105, "1554 73 MARY such marked symptoms of disaffection, that Huntly deemed it prudent to conclude his inglorious expedi tion, and return to court. His enemies eagerly seized this opportunity to conspire his ruin. His conduct, they contended, amounted to treason ; and they insisted that nothing but Huntly's confidence in his exorbitant power could have induced him to have acted with such flagrant contempt of the orders which he had received from his sovereign. To such accusations the Queen lent a willing ear. The Earl was cast into prison, stripped of his high offices, and sentenced to be banished for five years to France.1 When we con sider the services so lately performed by Huntly, in the revolution which gave Mary of Guise the regency, it is difficult to understand the causes of that sudden resentment to which he fell a victim. That he had abused the high powers entrusted to him, in the administration of the northern counties, is not improbable, and his imperious demeanour had perhaps provoked the resentment of the Queen's foreign advisers. One of these, Monsieur de Bontot, super seded him in his government of Orkney. De Rubay, we have already seen, in his character of vice chancellor had monopolised all the powers of the great seal, which properly belonged to Huntly as chancellor; and although he still kept the name of this office, and, by the payment of a heavy fine, procured the remission of his sentence of banishment, 1 Gregory's History of the Western Highlands and Isles, p. 183-184."], [106, "1555. 74 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. he remained stripped of his strength, and confined to the solitude of his estates.1 Notwithstanding these occasional demonstrations of severity against her Scottish nobles, the ex ertions of the Queen Regent were for some years successfully devoted to the maintenance of peace, and the promotion of the real welfare of the kingdom. Commissioners from England and Scotland met and established tranquillity upon the borders. She received assurances from Mary of England of her anxious desire for the preservation of friendly feelings between the two countries, and in return expressed a hope that this princess would not only be a \" peace keeper, but a peace-maker,\" in promoting a reconcili ation between the French monarch and the emperor.2 At home, a parliament assembled at Edinburgh (June 10, 1555), in which many wise and judicious laws were introduced for the abbreviation of legal processes, and the administration of equal justice throughout the country. Upon this subject, the Regent was principally guided by the sage counsels of Henry Sinclair, Dean of Glasgow, a man of pro found legal knowledge, and almost equal eminence as a scholar and a statesman.3 It appears by one of these statutes, that the maintenance of French soldiers 1 He was compelled to resign some lucrative gifts of lands, par- ticularly the Earldoms of Mar and Murray. \u2014 Gregory's Hist. p. 184. 2 St. P.

Another evinces the growth of that spirit of reform which, perhaps too severely, proscribed such unruly personages as Robin Hood, Little John, the Queen of May, and the Abbot of Unreason ; and prohibited those ancient games and festivals in which women, \" singing about summer trees,\" (to adopt the poetic phraseology of the statute) disturbed the Queen and her lieges in their progress through the country.1 From this statute, we may infer, that Mary of Guise was still disposed to favor the Pro testant party to whose support she owed much of her success ; and had she been permitted to follow the dictates of her own good sense, her administration would have continued popular. But, unfortunately, the war between France and England, and the influence which her brothers, the princes of the house of Guise, had acquired over her mind, compelled her about this time to the adoption of a measure, which occasioned amongst the minor barons and the great body of the people extreme jealousy and disgust. She purposed to take an inventory of every man's estate and substance, and to impose a tax for the support of a large body of troops, which should serve instead of the usual national force composed of the barons and their feudal retainers. The idea, which was none other than a scheme for a standing army, originated with the French and some of the highest 1 Acts of the Parliament of Scotland, vol. ii. p. 500."], [108, "76 1555.

Three hundred barons and gentlemen assembled in the abbey church of Holy rood, and despatched the Lairds of Wemyss and Calder with their remonstrances to the Regent. Their fathers, they said, had for many centuries defended their native country against every attack, with their faithful vassals and their good swords. It was the ancient custom of the realm \u2014 they held their lands by that tenure \u2014 and as they trusted they had not degenerated from their ancestry, they besought the Queen to use them as heretofore in that honourable service. Their monarch, they contended, was called King of Scots, with a special reference to his authority over the men, rather than over the sub stance of the country, and loath should they be, they declared, to entrust to any waged and mercenary sol diers, the protection of their wives, their children, and their hearths, when they were ready and able with their own hands to defend them at the peril of their lives. It evinced the good sense of the Queen Regent that she instantly desisted from the project, and acknow ledged her error in having ever proposed it.1 This wise conduct was for some time followed by the triumph of pacific counsels in Scotland. The ablest amongst the clergy and the most influential of the nobility both Popish and Protestant, strongly advocated their adoption, and Commissioners having met, a treaty for the continuance of peace was con- 1 Lesly, p. 255.

En couraged by these symptoms of approaching hostilities the Scottishborderers who seldom waited for a declara tion of war broke violently across the marches, cruelly ravaged the country in successive inroads,3 and were only checked by a severe defeat, which Lord Hume received at Blackbrey, (10th Nov. 1557).4 D'Oysel in the meantime, one of the Dowager's foreign advi sers, and lately Ambassador from the French Court, raised a fort at Aymouth, near Berwick, anticipating a speedy visit from the English, who instantly 1 Lesly, pp. 258, 259- MS.

At present, however, religious differences did not enter into the dispute. The great object of Mary of Guise was to bridle the power of Chastelherault, Argile, and Huntly, who had opposed the councils of France, and it is remarkable that at this moment James, Prior of St. Andrew's, styled by Lord Whar- 1 MS.

Some unforeseen impediments, however, inter rupted the execution of this scheme, and the Regent had recourse to a more effectual mode of strength ening her influence. A parliament assembled at Edinburgh (Dec. 14th 1557), in which a letter was presented from the King of France, earnestly recom mending, that the intended marriage between the Dauphin and the young Queen of Scots should be carried into effect. He requested that Commissioners should be sent over to give the sanction of their pre sence to this solemnity, and in compliance with his wishes, Beton, the Archbishop of Glasgow, Reed, President of the Session, Cassillis, Lord High Trea surer, the Lords Fleming and Seton, with the Prior of St. Andrew's, and Erskine of Dun the leaders of the Protestant party, were chosen to execute this im portant mission. They were instructed not to consent \u00bb MS. Letter, St. P. Office, B.C.

The young Queen and her husband were to be re quired at the same time to grant a commission for a Regent, to whom the supreme power was to be de legated. The Commissioners, after a perilous passage in which two of their convoy were wrecked, disembarked at Boulogne, and proceeding to the French court, received an honourable reception, and found a ready compliance with all their demands. Having secured, as they imagined, the rights of the kingdom, they proceeded to arrange the conditions of the marriage (19th April, 1558).1 It was provided that the eldest son of the marriage should be King of France and Scotland ; the Dauphin, by consent of the French King, his father, and the Queen his consort, was to bear the name and title of King of Scotland, to be allowed to quarter the arms of that crown with his own, and on his accession to the throne of France, to assume the title and arms of both kingdoms united under one crown. In the event of there being only daughters of the marriage, the eldest was to be Queen of Scotland, to have as a daughter of France, a por tion of four hundred thousand crowns, and to be dis posed of in marriage with the united consent of the estates of Scotland and the King of France.

Lastly, the Commissioners agreed, immediately after the marriage, to swear fealty to the Dauphin, in the name of the estates of Scotland, and on the ground that their sovereign, the Dauphiness, was his consort.1 These preliminaries having been arranged, the mar riage was solemnized at Paris by the Cardinal Bour bon, in the Cathedral Church of Notre Dame. It completed the almost despotic power of the House of Guise, and the powerful princes of this family who saw their niece, already a Queen, now promoted to the rank of Dauphiness, were solicitous to impart to the ceremony all imaginable splendour. The King and Queen of France, four Cardinals, the Princes of the Blood, and the flower of the French nobility surrounded the altar, and the classic genius of Buchanan hailed the event in an Epithalamium, which is one of the sweetest effusions of his muse. Such were the outward forms which preceded and accompanied this important union, and in appear ance the conduct of the French court was fair and honourable ; but another, and a far different scene of Guisian treachery and ambition, had been acting within the recesses of the cabinet. Ten days pre vious to her marriage, three papers were presented to 1 Keith, App. p. 21. \" A cause de la dite Dame Reyne Dauphine nostre Souveraine, son Espouse et Compaigne.\" The meaning is, that they swear fealty to the Dauphin as the husband of their queen. yOL. vi G"], [114, "1557. 82 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. the young Queen. By the first, she made over her kingdom of Scotland, in free gift, to the King of France, if she died childless. By the second, drawn up to meet the very probable case of a resistance by the Scots to so extraordinary a transfer, she assigned to the same monarch the possession of her kingdom, till he should be reimbursed in the sum of a million pieces of eight, or any such greater sum as he should have expended upon her education in France, and by the last she was made to declare, that these two deeds contained the genuine sense of her mind, whatever might appear to the contrary in any declarations which she should publish, in compliance with the desire of her parliament.1 These secret deeds the Guises induced their niece to sign \u2014 she was only fifteen, completely under their influence, and pro bably dreamt not of resistance, but when they brought the Scottish Commissioners before the French council, and required them not only to swear fealty to the King Dauphin, but to agree that he should receive the ensigns of royalty, they were met in this step of their ambition by a peremptory refusal : our instructions, said the Ambassadors, are distinct, and embrace no such matter, and even if free, it is little the part of faithful friends to name to us a proposal, which, if agreed to, would cover us with infamy.2 Disguising their resentment, the princes of the House of Guise, requested that the Commissioners would at least support their interests in the parlia- 1 Keith, p. 74. \u2022 Maitland, p. 903."], [115, "1557 83 MARY ment, and the Scottish prelates and nobles set out on their return. On reaching Dieppe, Reid, the Bishop of Orkney, one of the wisest and most upright men in Scotland, died suddenly on the 6th of September, \u2014 after two days, he was followed to the grave by the Earl of Rothes ; Cassillis, within a very brief interval, was seized with a similar illness, which carried him off, Fleming did not long survive him; and although no infectious disease was then prevalent in the country, several of their retinue sickened and expired. It was not surprising that men should connect these circumstances with the scenes lately acted at Paris, and there arose a suspicion that the Commissioners were poisoned by the Duke of Guise and his brothers, who thus determined to get rid of an influence which they knew would be exerted against them.1 The Archbishop of Glasgow, the Prior of St. Andrew's, Lord Seton and the Laird of Dun, continuing their voyage, arrived in Scotland in October, and the Queen Regent immediately summoned a parliament, which assembled at Edinburgh, in the beginning of December. Its proceedings were brief, but important. On receiving from the surviving Ambassadors an account of their mission, the three estates approved and rati fied their transactions. It was agreed at the same time, that the crown matrimonial should be given to the Dauphin, that he should have the name of King of Scotland, during the continuance of the marriage ; \u2022 Keith, p. 75.

This triumph was soon after followed by the death of Mary of England, and the accession of Elizabeth to the throne, an event, which occasioned an immediate change in the councils of that kingdom, and produced consequences especially worthy of attention. It is well known, that this great princess com menced her reign by the complete establishment of the Reformation in her own dominions, and by placing herself at the head of the Protestant party in Europe. Indifferent herself to religion, as far as it influences the individual character, she hated the Puritans, and was attached to the pomp and shew of prelacy: but her masculine understanding had early detected the errors of the Romish faith, her mind, naturally imperious, refused equally to acknowledge in man a spiritual or a temporal superior, and her discernment, aided by the counsels of the far-reaching Cecil, taught her that to continue faithful to the prin ciples of the Reformation offered the best hopes for 3 Lesly, p. 268 ; Keith p. 77."], [117, "1558 85 MARY the preservation of peace, the restoration of her exhausted finances, and the security of her kingdom. At home, two great principles regulated her govern ment \u2014 a determination to avoid war, even at consi derable sacrifices, and to enforce in every depart ment of the state, a rigid economy. To all classes of her subjects, her accession to the throne was a joyful event ; yet Elizabeth was aware that a large proportion of the people, far larger indeed than is commonly imagined, were still attached to the ancient faith, and she was naturally jealous of every thing that tended to increase the political power of the Romanists. Whilst she thus carefully watched the state of the two parties within her own dominions, she saw on the Continent the same struggle of opi nion dividing the leading states into two great factions and by skilfully balancing them against each other, she contrived to keep them too much occupied at home, to be able to give her any serious annoyance. The loss of Calais, which for two centuries had been in the possession of England, and still more, the resolution on the part of the Guises to assert the title of their niece, the Queen of Scotland, to the English throne, in exclusion of Elizabeth, whom they pro nounced illegitimate, were circumstances calculated to rouse the indignation of this princess : at a future period she clearly showed they had not been forgot ten by her, but for the present, policy got the better of resentment, and after having declined a proposal, upon the part of the French Monarch to enter into a private and separate peace, she became a party to the"], [118, "1558. 86 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. public treaty concluded between France and Spain, at Chateau Cambresis (25 May 1559).1 Her chief difficulties lay on the side of Scotland. In her instructions to the Bishop of Ely, Lord Wm. Howard, and Dr. Nicholas Wootton, whom she sent soon after her accession to negociate the treaty with France, we find her laying down the principle, that peace with Scotland is of greater consequence than peace with that country, and that unless the Scots are included, it were needless to continue the negotiations.2 Nor did the Queen Regent appear unwilling to meet these advances ; she despatched her able secre tary, Maitland, of Lethington, to assist at the con ferences in France,3 and at the same time that a pacification was concluded between England, France and Spain, (2nd April, 1559) a separate treaty for the cessation of hostilities was entered into between Eng land and Scotland.4 It was declared, that from this time a firm and lasting peace should be concluded be- 1 MS.

The history of this great and auspicious revolution in the history of the truth, is in Scotland connected almost exclusively with one extraordinary man \u2014 the intrepid and unbending Knox. When we last parted with him, it was after the surrender of the Castle of St. Andrew's, (1547) when he and other fellow-suf- ferers were carried prisoners aboard the gallies, into France. After a long and tedious captivity, he re- gained his liberty, (1550) \u2014 in what manner seems uncertain1 \u2014 and having repaired to England during the minority of Edward the Sixth, he found himself cordially welcomed and supported by the ministers of that young sovereign. Here he willingly gave his powerful aid to Cranmer, in the establishment of that Reformation which had been left imperfect by Henry the Eighth, but the sudden death of the king, and the accession of Mary, compelled him to fly to the Con- tinent. During his exile, he was called to be Minister of the English Refugees at Frankfort, but his attach- ment to the doctrines of Calvin, with whom he had formed an intimate friendship, made it impossible for him to adopt the principles of those who preferred the service book of Edward the Sixth, to the more simple and, as it appeared to Knox, the more scriptural form of Presbyterian worship, which at first, in compliance with their wishes, he had introduced amongst them ; religious dissensions arose. Dr. Cox, who had been tutor to Edward, vehemently contended for the service book, his party became all powerful, and the Scottish 1 Anderson's MS.

Before leaving the Con tinent, he had again visited Calvin, at Geneva. The conversation of this celebrated man, then in the height of his reputation and usefulness, confirmed Knox in his affection to that form of worship which had been established at Geneva, his solitary reflec tions in exile, and under persecution had, as we learn from his eloquent and pathetic letters, assumed an extraordinary bitterness of self-reproach, they seemed to upbraid him as one who had fled from the fold, and deserted his flock when the spiritual con flict most required his presence, and he returned to Scotland in 1555 with the stern and honest resolu tion to \" spare no arrows,\" to abide at his post, and to sacrifice everything for the complete establishment of the Reformation, according to those principles, which he believed to be founded on the word of God. During his absence from his native country, the persecutions of Mary had driven some pious and able men to take refuge in Scotland: Harlow, originally a tradesman in the lower ranks of life, but afterwards a zealous preacher under Edward the Sixth, took up his abode in Ayrshire, and assembled around him a little congregation\u2014 John Willock, a Scottish Franciscan Friar, who had been converted from Popery, and afterwards admitted a chaplain to the Duke of Suffolk, was another of these labourers.

The second arrival of Willock gave a great im pulse to the cause of the Reformation ; the images, says Knox, were stolen away, in all parts of the country, and in Edinburgh, that great idol called St. Giles was first drowned in the North Loch, and afterwards burnt, which raised no small trouble in the town. Notwithstanding this marked demonstra tion, it was resolved by the Queen Regent and the Bishops, that the usual procession which took place on the Saint's day should not be omitted, and having procured another image from the Grey Friars, and fixed it to a wooden barrow, which was borne on men's shoulders, the cavalcade, headed by the Regent herself, surrounded by Priests and Canons, and at tended by tabors and trumpets, proceeded down the high street towards the cross \u2014 the sight inflamed the passions of the protestants, and various bands of the citizens abhorring such an abomination resolved upon revenge. Nor was it long before this was accom plished ; for scarce had the Queen Dowager retired, when some of these, under pretence of assisting the bearers, caught hold of the barrow, cast down the idol, and dashing it to pieces on the pavement, left Dagon without a head or hands, and then (I use the"], [123, "1558 MARY 91 words of Knox) \" the priests and friars fled faster than they did at Pinky-Cleuch ; down goeth the crosses, off goeth the surplices, round caps and cornets with the crowns. The Grey Friars gaped, the Black Friars blew, the Priests panted and fled, and happy was he that first gat the house, for such a sudden fray came never among the generation of Antichrist, within this realm before.\" 1 Yet although some progress had been made, and Knox hailed with gratitude the co-operation of Willock, it was with feelings of astonishment, border ing upon horror, that he found the friends of the Protestant opinions, unresolved upon the great question, whether it was their duty openly to separate from the Church. Many of them continued still to sanction by their presence the celebration of the mass, and as the Queen Dowager had found it neces sary in the prosecution of her political objects, to extend her favor to the Protestants, they were anxious to stretch their conformity to the national Church, as far, perhaps even farther, than their consciences permitted. The discourses of the Reformer, who at first preached privately to a few friends, in the house of James Syme, a burgess of Edinburgh, soon threw a new light upon the danger and sinfulness of such conduct.1 Men's consciences became seriously alarmed, a solemn disputation was held upon the point between Maitland, of Lethington, and Knox. The Secretary, a man of remarkable learning and 1 Knox, p. 104. s Kno.x, p. 98, 99. Keith, p. 64.

But Knox, mighty in the Scriptures, honest and straightforward in his adherence to the truth, and master of that style of familiar and fervid eloquence, which was adapted to the age and the audience, triumphed over his more elegant and subtle dis putant \u2014 Maitland acknowledged his error, the prac tice was renounced, and it was agreed by the con gregation which now surrounded the Reformer, that a public and formal separation must henceforth be made from the Popish Church in Scotland.1 Amongst his hearers and followers at this time (1555), we find some men who became afterwards noted in the history of their country. Erskineof Dun, a baron of ancient family, whose learning was superior to the times ; Sir James Sandilands, commonly called Lord St. John, a veteran in his adherence to the Reformation ; Archibald Lord Lorn, afterwards Earl of Argile ; the Master of Mar, the Lord James, afterwards Regent ; the Earl of Glencairn, and the Earl Marshall were usually present at his sermons, and ardent admirers of his doctrine. At length the Romish clergy, hitherto unaccountably indifferent, roused themselves from their lethargy, and Knox was summoned to appear before an ecclesiastical convention in the capital.2 He 1 M(Crie's Life of Knox, vol.'i. p.

This liberty he probably owed to the toleration of the Queen Regent ; but when, at the request of the Earl Marshall, he carried his boldness so far as to address to this daughter of the House of Guise a letter, in which he exhorted her not only to protect the reformed preachers, but to lend a favourable ear to their doc trine, he found his propositions received with derision and contempt. Receiving his letter from Glencairn, and glancing carelessly over it, the Dowager handed it to the Archbishop of Glasgow, asking him if his Lordship was solicitous to read a pasquil, a mode of proceeding which the Reformer treated afterwards with uncommon severity.1 At this critical period, when rejoicing in the success of his preaching, and congratulating himself that the time of the Church's deliverance was drawing nigh, Knox received an invitation to become pastor of the reformed congregation at Geneva, and the readiness with which he obeyed the summons is an inexplicable circumstance in his life. Although his labours had been ' singularly rewarded, the infant congregation which he had gathered round him still required his nurture and protection. During his last * Keith, p. 65. 1 M'Crie's Life, vol. i. p. 1 88."], [126, "94 1558. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. journey into Angus, the threatenings of the friars and bishops had increased, and the clouds of persecution were seen gathering around him. The state of the gospel at Geneva, on the contrary, was prosperous. He had before bitterly upbraided himself for desert ing his appointed charge in the hour of peril, yet he now repeated the same conduct, left his native country, and settled with his family on the Continent. It was in vain to tell his followers, as he did, that if they continued in godliness, whenever they pleased they might command his return. They were continuing in the truth, as he has himself informed us, and they earnestly but unsuccessfully endeavoured to detain him. The rage, indeed, of his opponents was about to assume at this time a deadly aspect. They had delated him to the Queen as an enemy to magistrates, as well as a seducer of the people, and possibly by retiring he saved his life ;' but judging with all charity, it must be admitted that whilst his writings at this season had all the impassioned zeal, his conduct betrayed some want of the ardent courage, of the martyr. His retreat had an immediate and unfavourable effect on the progress of the Reformation. The bishops and the friars increased in boldness and violence. Knox, whose personal encounter they dreaded, now that his appearance was impossible, received a summons to stand his trial ; condemnation 1 Such is the opinion of his late excellent biographer Dr. M'Crie.

Previous to his depar ture, the Reformer exhorted his followers to con tinue their private meetings, which he said they ought to open and conclude with prayer, to read the Scriptures, and to listen to the word of exhortation from any experienced brother, provided his instruc tions were given with modesty and a desire to edify. Such directions they willingly obeyed, and secure in the countenance and protection of the Queen Mother, who at this time courted their assistance, they became less the objects of jealousy and persecution to their adversaries of the Romish faith. Nor were they long left without preachers. In the year succeeding the retirement of Knox, John Douglas, a converted Carmelite friar, who was chaplain to the Earl of Argile, not only addressed a private congregation, but spoke openly at the Court, against the supersti tions of the times. Paul Methven, also, originally a tradesman, began to teach in Dundee, others ex horted the people in Angus and Merns, and the Romish clergy taking alarm so far succeeded in working upon the fears of the Regent, that she issued a proclamation summoning the preachers to answer for their conduct. This they prepared instantly to obey, but the gentlemen of the west of Scotland who formed the chief part of their congregations, resolved to accompany them to their trial, and many already had arrived in the capital, when the Queen, dreading a tumult, commanded all who had no express exemp tion, to repair for fifteen days to the Borders. Far from"], [128, "1558. 96 HISTORY OF. SCOTLAND. submitting to an order of which they easily detected the object, the Barons surrounded the palace, obtained an audience, and in reply to the remonstrances of the Regent, thus addressed her : \u2014 \"We know, Madam, that this is the device of the Bishops who now stand beside you. We avow to God it shall not go so. They oppress us and our poor tenants to feed them selves ; they trouble our ministers, and seek to undo them and us all. We will not suffer it any longer.\" This bold address was delivered by Chalmers of Catgirth, one of the Barons of the west, and it is said as he concluded it, his companions, who had hitherto been uncovered, with an air of defiance put on their steel caps. The Regent was intimidated, declared that she meant no violence against their teachers, revoked the proclamation, and promised to be herself the judge of the controversy.1 This success, and a period of tranquillity which succeeded to it, emboldened the leaders of the reform party, the Earl of Glencairn, Lord Lorn, son of the Earl of Argile; Erskine of Dun, and the Prior of St. Andrew's, afterwards the celebrated Regent Murray, to request the return of Knox to his native country. In a letter addressed to the Reformer, they informed him that the \" faithful of his acquaintance were stedfast to the belief in which he had left them, that they thirsted for his presence, and were ready to jeopard their lives for the glory of God. Little 1 Knox's Reformation, p. 103. Spottiswood, B. ii. p. 94.

They stated, that the zeal of the reformers had suddenly cooled ; that many, contented with the toleration they enjoyed, preferred the security of worshipping God in private according to their conscience, to the peril attending a public reformation, and that the scheme which had given rise to their letter had been precipitately abandoned. It did not belong to the disposition or principles of the Reformer to bear this vacillating conduct in silence. He addressed to them an imme diate and indignant remonstrance, urged upon them the sacred duty of accomplishing the great workwhich they had begun ; assured them that although dangers and trials must be met with in its prosecution, their relinquishing it would not save them from the most tyrannical proscription, and concluded by reminding them, that so vitally important a matter as the reform ation of religion belonged to them, the nobility, even more than to the clergy or chief rulers called kings.1 This epistle, which was accompanied by a detailed address to the nobles, and by private letters to Erskine of Dun, and Wishart of Pitarrow, two leading men amongst the reformers, produced an astonishing effect. The lords deplored their weak- 1 Keith, pp. 65, 66. H VOL.

It described in no mild or measured terms the bishops and ministers of the Romish Church, as members of Sathan, who sought to destroy the gospel of Christ and his followers, and declared that they felt it to be their duty to strive in their Master's cause even unto death \u2014 certain as they were of victory in him. For this purpose it declared that they had entered into a solemn promise in the presence of God and his Con- gregation, to set forward and establish with their whole power and substance his blessed Word \u2014 to labour to have faithful ministers \u2014 to defend them, at the peril of their lives and goods, against all tyranny ; and it concluded by anathematizing their adversaries, and denouncing vengeance against all the superstition, idolatry, and abominations of the Papal church.1 This bond, which was drawn up at Edinburgh, received the signatures of the Earls of Glencairn, Argile, Morton, Lord Lorn, Erskine of Dun, aud many others. It was evidently an open declaration of war against the established religion \u2014 toleration and compromise were at an end, and their next step showed that the Congregation\u2014 for so the 1 Keith, p. 66.

They passed a resolution declaring, \"that in all parishes of the realm, the common prayer, (by which was meant the service book of Edward the Sixth,)1 should be read weekly, on Sunday and other festival days, in the parish churches, with the lessons of the Old and New Testament, conform to the book of common prayer ; and that if the curates of parishes be quali fied they shall be caused to read the same ; \" but if they refuse, then the most qualified in the parish were directed to supply their place. It was re solved at the same time, that \" doctrine, preaching, and interpretation of Scripture be used privately in quiet houses, avoiding great conventions of the people thereto, until such time as God should move the Prince to grant public preaching by true and faithful ministers.\"2 These resolutions the Lords of the Congregation proceeded to put in execution in such places as were under their power. The Earl of Argile encouraged Douglas, his chaplain, to preach openly in his house; other barons imitated his example ; a second invita tion was addressed to Knox, (November, 1558) requesting his immediate presence amongst them, and a deep alarm seized the whole body of the Romish clergy. They represented, not unreasonably, the declarations of the Congregation, and their sub sequent conduct, as acts bordering upon treason ; the Romish faith, they said, was still the established i This will be afterwards proved. !

To what this might grow it was difficult to say, but it was impossible to view so bold a denunciation of the national religion without apprehension and dismay.1 These remonstrances were addressed to the Queen Regent at that critical season, when the marriage between her daughter and the Dauphin, although proposed in the Scottish Parliament, had not been fully agreed to. It was necessary for her to manage matters warily with the principal nobles, and she expressed a stedfast disinclination to all extreme measures against the Congregation. The Archbishop of St. Andrew's also, a prelate whose character partook nothing of cruelty, though his morals were loose and depraved, addressed an admonitory letter to Argile, persuading him to dismiss his heretical chaplain, promising to supply his place with a learned and Catholic instructor, complaining of the reproaches to which his ecclesiastical lenity had ex posed him, and insinuating that repeated provocations might compel him, as the spiritual guardian of the Church, to adopt a severer course (March 1558). Nor was it long before this severity was experienced, although there seems good ground for believing that the prelate was innocent of having instigated it. 1 Cook, vol. ii. p. 35.

Encouraged by the subsequent leniency of the Queen Dowager, this aged and venerable minister of the truth, who was past eighty, had openly preached to the people ; but the severity of the clergy again compelled him to seek his lurking places, and being discovered at this time, he was tried for heresy at St. Andrew's, and condemned to be burnt. From his feeble frame and great age it was expected that he would say little in his defence, but the old man ex hibited uncommon spirit, and so deeply moved were all who heard him by his pathetic appeal and ardent exposition of the truth, that after the clergy had pro nounced him guilty, no secular judge could be found to pass sentence. The odious office, however, was at last performed by a dissolute retainer of the Arch bishop, and he was led to the stake amid the tears and sympathy of an immense multitude, who exe crated the cruelty of which he was the victim. Sur rounded by the flames, he was yet able to testify that the cause for which he suffered was the defence of the truth of Jesus Christ. \"As for myself,\" said he, \"I am fourscore and two years old and cannot live long by the course of nature, but a hundred better shall rise out of the ashes of my bones, and I trust in God I am the last that shall suffer death in Scotland for"], [134, "1558. 102 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. this cause.''1 And his prophetic wishes were fulfilled : he teas the last in that country of the army of martyrs (April, 1558.) This cruel and iniquitous execution was viewed by the people with horror, and excited the utmost in dignation in the leaders of the Congregation. They remonstrated in firm terms to the Queen Regent, and when this princess assured them that she was no party to such sanguinary proceedings, their whole animosity was directed against the clergy. Emis saries commissioned by the reformers travelled through the country, exposing the superstition, wickedness and injustice of such conduct ; many of the lesser barons, and the greater part of the towns joined the party; a majority of the people de clared themselves ready to support the cause, and the Protestant lords presented an address to the Dowager, in which they claimed redress at her hands \"of the unjust tyranny used against them by those called the estate ecclesiastical. ''2 \" Your Grace,\" said they, \" cannot be ignorant what controversy hath been and yet is, concerning the true religion and right worshipping of God, and how the clergy (as they will be termed) usurp to themselves such empire over the consciences of men, that whatsoever they command must be obeyed, and whatsoever they forbid avoided, without respect to God's pleasure revealed in his 1 M'Crie's Life of Knox, vol. i. p. 234.

It was evident \" they said, \" that abuses had now grown to such a head that a public reformation was necessary, as well in religion as in the temporal government of the state, and they therefore implored her Grace and her grave council, whom they willingly acknowledged as the only authority placed in the realm for the correction of ecclesiastical and civil disorders, that she would listen to their requests, unless by God's word it could be shown that they were unjust and ought to be denied.1\" The following requests were appended to the supplication ; they were drawn up with force and clearness, and involved, if granted, a complete re formation. It was required, first, that the Congre gation should be allowed to meet in public or in private, to hear common prayers in the vulgar tongue, that they might increase in knowledge, and be led with all fervour and sincerity to offer up their peti tions for the Universal Church, the Queen, their sovereign, and her royal consort, the Regent, and the whole estates of the realm. Secondly, That it should i Keith, pp. 78, 79- Knox, Hist. p. 127-"], [136, "1558. 104 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. be lawful for any one present who was well qualified in knowledge to interpret any obscure passages in the Scriptures which should be read. Thirdly, That baptism and the Lord's Supper should be adminis tered in the vulgar tongue, and this last sacrament in both kinds according to our Saviour's institution, and lastly, that the present wicked and scandalous lives of the clergy should be reformed, in obedience to the rules contained in the New Testament, the writings of the Fathers, and the godly laws of the Emperor Justinian \u2014 which three standards they were willing should decide the controversy between them and the Romish clergy.1 These proposals, and the supplication which intro duced them, although expressed with apparent mo deration, could not be viewed without alarm by the Queen Dowager. The Lords of the Congregation acknowledged her indeed as the sole constituted authority within the realm, yet with some inconsis tency they not only represented themselves as part of that power which God had established, but declared it to have been pusillanimous in them not to have actively interfered in defence of their brethren, against the tyranny by which they had been op pressed. As Barons of Parliament, they were certainly part of the established power in the realm ; but to have defended their oppressed brethren by any faction or assembly out of Parliament, would have been un constitutional and illegal. Again, when in their first petition they asked permission, to use the common 1 Spottiswood, B. S, p. 11(). Keith, p. 80. Knox, p. 129."], [137, "1558 MARY 105 prayers in the vulgar tongue, we know, by certain evidence, that the service book of Kins: Edward was , *^ here meant; but when they required that any person sufficiently learned should be allowed in their meetings to interpret obscure passages, it is evident that they demanded a liberty unknown to the most zealous Presbyterians of the present day. However unpalatable such requests might be, it did not suit the views of Mary of Guise to give them a decided refusal. The marriage between her daugh ter and the Dauphin had indeed been concluded, but at this moment she required all the influence of the Pro testant Lords in Parliament to obtain the crown ma trimonial, and the title of King for the Dauphin. When, therefore, the petition was presented to her at Holyrood House, by Sir James Sandilands, the ve nerable preceptor of the Knights of St. John, she received it with respect, promised them that their proposals should have her anxious consideration, and in the meantime assured them of her protection.1 Very different were the effects produced by this conduct on the Romish clergy and the Lords of the Congregation. Grateful for her forbearance, and rely ing upon her promises, the Protestants abstained from all public exercise of their religion, and silenced one of their ministers who attempted to preach at Leith. But the Papal party arraigned the pusil lanimity of the Regent in condescending to tempo- 1 Knox's History pp. 126, . 30. M'Crie's Knox, p. 236. vol. i.

The terms, how ever, were such as the Protestants could not accept. It was insisted that the mass, purgatory, prayers to saints and for the dead, should remain parts of the established creed of the Church, which if they granted, the reformers were to be allowed to pray and baptize in the vulgar tongue, provided these in novations were confined to their private assemblies.2 In the Parliament which assembled at Edinburgh, in December, 1558 \u2014 when, as we have already seen, the three estates received from the Ambassadors who had returned from France, an account of their pro ceedings \u2014 the leaders of the Congregation presented a supplication, to which they annexed some impor tant requests, in their own name and that of their brethren. They desired that all Acts of Parliament by which churchmen were empowered to proceed against heretics should be suspended until the pre sent controversies in religion were determined by a general council of the Church, and that in the meantime churchmen should be permitted only to accuse, but not to judge \u2014 lest, however, this should seem to countenance licentiousness of opinion on sacred subjects, it was requested that all such as were 1 Keith p. 80. ' Knox, pp. 129, 130."], [139, "1558 MARY 107 accused of heresy should be carried before a temporal judge, should be permitted to speak in their defence, to state objections to witnesses, and to explain their own belief, nor ought they, it was added, to be condemn ed, unless proved by the word of God to have erred from that faith which is necessary to salvation.1 On presenting these articles to the Regent, she exerted all her influence to avert their immediate discussion in Parliament. This, she contended, would be fol lowed by exasperation on the part of the clergy, which might be fatal to the attainment of those great po litical objects for which she and the Protestant lords were alike anxious. \"Let, them,\" she said, \" but wait for a brief season, and all their wishes might be ac complished ; but at present it was evident, that such a debate as was likely to follow their introduction would be dangerous and premature.\" Convinced by such a representation, or at least anxious to avoid all appearance of obstinacy or pre cipitation, the Lords withdrew their Articles, and contented themselves with presenting a protestation, which was read in Parliament. In this solemn in strument, they alluded to the controversy which had of late years arisen between those called Prelates and rulers in the Church, and the nobles and com mons of the realm, regarding the worship of God, the duty of ministers, and the right administration of the sacraments ; they had already repeatedly com plained, they said, that their consciences were bur- > Keith, p. 81."], [140, "1558. 108 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. dened with unprofitable ceremonies, and many ido- latrous abuses, and it was their intention to have sought in this present Parliament the redress of such enormities. This resolution the troubles of the time had compelled them for a season to delay. Yet, fearful lest their silence should be misinterpreted, they now protested, that since they could not at present obtain a just reformation, it should be law- ful for them to use themselves in matters of religion and conscience as they must answer to God, and in the true faith which is grounded upon Holy Scripture \u2014 and this without incurring any danger of life and lands, for the neglect or contravening of such Acts as had been passed in favour of their ad- versaries. In conclusion, they declared, that no blame ought to attach to them if any tumult or uproar should arise among the subjects of the realm on account of diversity of religion, or if it happened that those abuses which had been so long neglected, should at last be summarily or vio lently reformed.1 It is obvious, from the terms of this eloquent paper, that the Congregation felt their own strength, and did not shut their eyes to those calamitous results, in which a continuance of reli gious persecution might possibly involve the coun try. They were anxious for a quiet and temperate reform of those unprofitable ceremonies which loaded their conscience, and it was their wish to see re moved, without any public violence, the deep and 1 Spottiswood, pp. 120, 121.

They had prepared themselves for the worst \u2014 and it was fortunate they had done so, for at this crisis the accession of Eliza beth to the throne, and the alteration in the policy of the Guises, produced a sudden revolution in the mind of the Queen Regent. This princess, to resume the course of our history,1 was now possessed of the great objects to which all her efforts had been so long directed. She had obtained the supreme power, her daughter, the Queen, was married to the Dauphin, and the title of King of Scotland, and the crown matrimonial, had been solemnly conferred upon him by the Scottish Parliament. For the attainment of these objects, she had been greatly indebted to the assistance of the Protestant leaders. But she was also under obliga tions to France, especially to her brothers, the princes of the House of Guise, and these ambitious and unscrupulous men now claimed as a return, that she should join that league for the destruction of the Protestants, and the re-establishment of the Catholic faith in Europe, to which they had become parties with the Pope, the King of Spain, and the Emperor. As one part of their vast and unprincipled design, it was necessary to put down the Reformation in 1 Sec Supra, p. 86. 11 7 4\u2014 YOI . VI."], [142, "110 1558. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Scotland, and to secure the French ascendancy in that country ; and having accomplished this, they trusted it would be no difficult matter to expel Eliza beth from the throne, to place the crown on the head of Mary, the young Queen of Scotland, whom they had already induced to assume the title of Queen of England, and under her to unite the two kingdoms in the profession of the ancient faith. These designs, and her expected co-operation in them, were communicated to the Queen Regent, by Monsieur de Bettancourt, who arrived in Scotland on a mission from the King of France, soon after the conclusion of the peace of Cambray.1 The disposition of Mary of Guise was inclined to moderate measures, and being attached to some of the leaders of the Protestants, to whose abilities and friendship she had been indebted, it was not without emotion and regret that she received the proposals of France. But she had been educated in the Romish faith, and in a profligate court, her brothers, the Cardinal and the Duke, had acquired an extraordinary influence over her mind, the great body of the Papal clergy in Scotland urged upon her the necessity of adopt ing decided measures to check the rapid growth of heresy, and after a feeble and unsuccessful remon strance to the Court of France, she abandoned her better resolutions, and resigned herself to the entire direction of the Guises. This fatal change in the policy of the Queen Re gent was followed by an immediate collision between 1 Maitland, vol. ii. pp. 909, 910. Carte, vol. iii. p. 378. Mel vil's Memoirs, pp. 77, 78. Bannat.

To these they not only received a de cided refusal, but the Synod, contrary to the spirit of improvement and conciliation exhibited in the pre ceding year, declared that no language, except the Latin, could be used in the public prayers of the Church, without violating its express decrees, and offering offence to the majesty of God \u2014 nor was this all. The Queen, with a rigour for which it is difficult to account, issued a proclamation for con formity of religion ; all were commanded to resort daily to mass, and confession ; in an interview with some of the Protestant leaders, she exhibited to them the injunctions she had received from France, warned them of the peril in which they stood, and sum moned the most distinguished among the reformed ministers to appear before a Parliament, to be held at Stirling, and defend themselves from the accusa tions which were to be brought against them.1 Alarmed by these rash and unwise proceedings, the Earl of Glencairn, and Sir Hugh Campbell, she riff of Ayr, requested an audience, in which they deli vered a stong remonstrance. But when they besought 1 Spottiswood, p. 120.

The remonstrances which he had trans- mitted to the Lords of the Conoreo-ation from Dieppe, had produced the most favourable effects ; and in obedience to the second invitation, addressed to him in the month of Nov. 1558, he now came to take his part with Willock, Douglas, and others, faithful preachers, who, during his absence, had laboured, at the peril of their lives, for the esta- blishment of the truth. He found the cause of the Congregation in a condition very different from that in which he had left it at the period of his re- treat from Scotland in 1557. Then the seed had indeed been sown, and in some places began to spring up ; but the Romish party were predominant, and \" matters had not yet ripened for a general re- formation.''2 Now, the Protestant faith was espoused by large masses of the people, professed by the most powerful of the nobles, and in the event of attack 1 MS. Calderwood, vol. i. p. 311. * M'Crie's Life of Knox, vol. i.p. 192. VOL. VI. I"], [146, "1559. 114 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. it could look with some confidence to the counte nance and support of England. But it acquired a wonderful accession of strength in the return of this bold, uncompromising, and eloquent adherent, who, without delaying in the capital, repaired directly to Dundee. Here, when he learnt the pro ceedings against the ministers, he earnestly required that he might be permitted to assist his brethren, and to make confession of his faith along with them, a request which we may believe was readily granted. It was now resolved by the leaders of the Congre gation, that they would accompany their preachers to Stirling, and the principal barons of Angus and Mearns took their journey for this purpose to Perth. They wore no armour, but declared, that they came as peaceable men, and solely to make confession of their faith, and to assist their ministers in their just defence.1 Lest their numbers might create alarm, Erskine, of Dun, a grave and pru dent man, eminent for his early adherence to the truth, leaving his brethren in Perth, went forward to Stirling, and requested an interview with the Queen. On this occasion the Regent acted with much dissi mulation ; she listened with apparent moderation, and when the envoy assured her that the single wishes of the Congregation were, to be permitted to worship God according to their conscience, and to secure liberty to their preachers, she declared, that if the people would disperse, the preachers should be 1 MS. Calderwood, vol. i. p. 311."], [147, "1559 115 MARY unmolested, the summons discharged, and new pro ceedings taken, which should remove all ground of complaint. Relying upon this promise, Erskine wrote to his brethren, who were at Perth ; their leaders sent home the people, and it was expected that peace and toleration would be restored. But with the removal of the danger, the Regent thought it politic to forget her promises, and, with a precipi tation which was as treacherous as it was short sighted, the summons was continued ; the ministers who did not appear were denounced rebels, and every person prohibited, under the penalty of high treason, from receiving or supporting them.1 En raged at such perfidy, the Laird of Dun withdrew indignantly from court, rejoined his brethren, who were still at Perth, excused himself for having too much trusted a princess, who, he was now con vinced, was resolved upon their destruction, and warned them to prepare for those extreme measures which were meditated against them. His repre sentations made the deepest impression, and Knox seized the moment to deliver to the people a sermon against Idolatry, with all that fervid and impas sioned eloquence, for which he was so remarkable. He described how odious this crime appeared in the sight of God, what positive commands had been given in Scripture for the destruction of its monuments, and concluded by a denunciation of the mass, as one of the most abominable forms in which it 1 Ibid. p. 311 ; Keith, pp. 83, 84. I 2"], [148, "7559 116 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. had ever appeared to ensnare and degrade the hu- man mind.1 It is by no means clear that the preacher, or the leaders of the Congregation who supported him, en- tertained at this moment any intention of exhorting the multitude to open violence ; on the contrary, the Con- gregation after the conclusion of the sermon quietly dispersed, and a few loiterers, or, to use Knox's ex- pressions, \" certain godly men\" alone remained in the church. Scarce, however, had the preacher retired, when a priest, with a spirit either of mistaken zeal or of ill-timed defiance, unveiled a rich shrine which stood above one of the altars, and disclosing the images of the Virgin and the Saints prepared to celebrate mass. A youth, who had listened to Knox's exhort- ations, exclaimed that this was intolerable. He appealed to those who stood by, and conjured them not to permit that idolatry which God had con- demned to be used in their despite and before their face.1 The priest, indignant at the interruption, struck him, and he retaliated by casting a stone at the altar, which broke one of the images. In an instant all was uproar and confusion, those who till now had been only spectators, and whose minds from the recent eloquence of Knox were highly excited broke in upon the shrine, tore down its ornaments' shivered it to pieces, and, being joined by others whom the noise had attracted, demolished every monument or relic which they imagined to savour of idolatry, in 1 MS. Calderwood, p. 313, vol. i. * Ihid."], [149, "1559. MARY. 117 an incredibly short space of time. (May 11, 1559.) The confusion now increased, and they who had inflicted this summary vengeance being joined by the \" rascal multitude,\" as Knox denominates them, rushed with headlong fury to the religious houses of the Grey and Black Friars. They seem to have found them deserted \u2014 no defence at least was made \u2014 and in a few hours these magnificent edifices were spoiled of their wealth, and their altars, confessionals, and every ancient and hallowed relic which adorned them torn down and defaced. The same fate was experienced by the Charter House or Carthusian monastery, a building of extraordinary strength and magnificence, of which within two days nothing was to be seen but the bare and melancholy walls. The first invasion or impulse appears to have been solely against \" idolatry,\" but although the preachers had been care ful to warn their hearers not to put their hands to a reformation for covetousness sake, the people, stimu lated by the extraordinary wealth and luxury of the Grey Friars, began to spoil. No honest man, how ever, says Knox, was enriched to the value of a groat, and the plunder was permitted to the poor. The probability seems to be, that the poor took the liberty of helping themselves.1 Nor was this ebullition of popular fury confined to Perth ; the infection spread to Couper, a small town which had embraced the Spottiswood, 121, 122.

It was with feelings of deep resentment that the Queen Dowager heard of these violent and illegal proceedings. She lamented especially the destruc- tion of the monastery of Carthusians, a royal foun- dation, and honoured by her as holding the ashes of James the First. In the first paroxysm of her anger she vowed vengeance against all who were connected with the disturbance, and declared her resolution to rase the town of Perth to the ground, and sow it with salt, as a monument of perpetual desolation.1 These were not meant to be empty threats. She instantly summoned to her defence the Duke of Chastelherault, with Athole, and D'Osell the French commander; she remonstrated with those leaders amongst the Con- gregation, who, though attached to the doctrines of the Reformation, were inimical to the excesses which had been committed; two of these, the Earl of Argile and the Lord James, disclaiming all intentions of affording encouragement to rebellion, joined her with their forces, and on the 18th of May she advanced towards Perth, where the Protestants had begun to collect their strength. Soon after they drew up three letters in justification of their proceedings. In the first, which was addressed to the Queen Regent, they informed this princess, that, although they had till now served her with willing hearts, they should be 1 Knox, 137. MS. Calderwood, vol. i. pp. 322, 323."], [151, "1559. MARY. 119 constrained, if she continued her unjust persecution, to take the sword of just defence. They were ready, they added, to obey their Sovereign and her husband under the single condition that they might live in peace, and have the word of Jesus Christ truly preached, and his sacraments rightly administered. Without this they were determined never to be sub ject to mortal men. They declared that they were about to notify what they had done to their Sove reign and the King of France, and they conjured her, in the name of God, and as she valued the peace of the realm, not to invade them till they had received their answer.1 The second letter of the Congrega tion, which was a more elaborate defence, was directed to the Nobility of Scotland. They knew, they said, that the nobles were divided in opinion. Some regarded them as a faction of heretics and seditious men who troubled the Commonwealth, and against whom no punishment could be too severe ; others were persuaded of the justice of their cause, nay, had for sometime openly professed it, and after having exhorted them to the enterprise had deserted them in their extreme necessity. To the first they alleged, that none could prove such offences against them, all that they had done being in obedience to God, who had commanded idolatry and its monuments to be cast clown and destroyed. \" Our earnest and long request,\" they continued \" hath been and is, that in open assembly it may be disputed, in presence of indif ferent auditors, whether these abominations, named 1 Keith, p. 86. 22 May, 1559-"], [152, "1559. 120 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. by the pestilent papists Religion, which they by fire and sword defend, be the true Religion of Jesus Christ or not. Now, this humble request being denied us, our lives are sought in a most cruel manner, and ye the nobility whose duty it is to defend innocents and to bridle the fury and rage of wicked men, were it of Princes or Emperors, do notwithstanding follow their a petites, and arm yourselves againstyourbrethren and natural countrymen. If ye think that we be criminal because we dissent from you in opinion, consider, we beseech you, that the prophets under the law, the apostles of Christ Jesus, after his ascension, the primitive church and holy martyrs did disagree with the whole world in their days ; and will ye deny that their action was just, and that all those who perse- cuted them were murderers before God ?

Ye have a multitude that agree with you, and so had they \u2014 ye have antiquity of time, and that they lacked not \u2014 ye have councils, laws, and men of reputation that have established all things as ye suppose ; but none of all these can make any religion acceptable to God, which only dependeth upon his own will revealed to man in his most sacred word.

It was directed, \" to the generation of Anti-Christ, the pestilent Prelates, and their shavelings within Scot land.\" It contained a tremendous anathema against those who in their blind fury had caused the blood of martyrs to be shed, it warned them, that if they pro ceeded in their cruelty, they should be made the sub jects of a war of extermination such as Israel carried on with the Canaanites ; it arrogated to themselves the appellation of the congregation of Christ; it stig matized their opponents as the offspring of the man of sin, and concluded, by uniting, in a manner which none can read without sorrow, expressions of ex tremest vengeance and wrath, with the holy name of God, and the gospel of peace and love, which was preached by his Son.2 It was not to be expected that such violent mea sures should be attended with pacific effects; the army of the Protestants was inferior to their oppo nents, and the Queen Regent, confident of victory 1 Knox, pp. 139, MO, 141. 2 Keith, p. 87-"], [154, "1559. 122 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. had disdainfully rejected all proposals of negotiation when the arrival of Glencairn in the camp of the Congregation, at the head of two thousand five hun dred men, induced her to hesitate. By the mediation of the Earl of Argile and the Lord James a cessation of hostilities was agreed on. Both armies consented to disperse \u2014 the town was to be left open to the Queen Regent. No person was to be troubled or brought to answer for the late changes in religion, and abolishing of idolatry ; the religion begun was to be suffered to go forward ; no Frenchman was to approach within three miles of the town; when the Queen retired no French garrison was to he left within it ; and in the mean time all controversies were to be reserved till the meeting of Parliament.1 This treaty having been concluded, Willock, who had arrived with Glencairn, and Knox, who had remained at Perth since the demolition of the monas teries, sought an interview with Argile and the Lord James, and upbraided them with their desertion of the brethren. They repelled the accusation with warmth, declared their steady attachment to the cause, but said that they had promised the Queen, to labour for peace, and that the terms which she had offered were too reasonable to be refused. If, however, she proved false to her word, they called God to witness, that they would assist and concur with their brethren in 1 These conditions of the capitulation are in the express words of Knox, p. 146, and Spottiswood, p. 122.

It was right, he observed before they left the scene of their labours, that all men should be exhorted to constancy and thankful ness. It had pleased God to stay the rage of the enemy without the effusion of blood ; but he added, with that discernment into human motives and character with which he was eminently gifted, that he was well assured the Queen meant no truth, \" that it became no brother to be weary or faint, since he was certain the treaty would only be kept till the Regent and her Frenchmen became the strongest.\"2 Profiting by these warnings, the Lords of the Congregation before they separated framed a new bond or Covenant, in which it was agreed \" to unite together \" in doing all things required of God in his Scripture that might be to his glory, and to put away all things that dishonoured his name, and hindered his pure and true worship. They solemnly obli ged themselves to defend the Congregation or any of its members when trouble was intended against them, and they promised in the presence of God to spare neither labour, life, nor substance, in maintain ing the liberty of the whole brethren, against whatever person should trouble them for the cause of religion or any other cause thereon depending. This agreement was signed by the Earls of Argile and Glencairn, the Lord James, Lord Boyd, Lord Ochil- 1 Knox, p. 146. - Ibid. p. 150."], [156, "1559. 124 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. tree, whose daughter Knox afterwards married ; and Matthew Campbell of Taringhame.1 It was soon seen how necessary were these mea sures to the existence of the Protestants. They had left Perth on the 29th of May ; that day the Queen Regent entered the town, and with the duplicity which Knox had anticipated, violated the promise which she had made. Chastelherault, D'Osell, and a body of French soldiers accompanied her ; the chief magistrates who had been favourers of the Reformation, were deprived of their authority ; Char ters of Kinfauns, a man of profligate manners, was made Provost, and many of the inhabitants abandoned their houses and submitted to a voluntary exile, rather than witness the re-establishment of that worship which they abhorred. It had been stipulated that Perth should not be left in the occupation of a French garrison, and the Regent congratulated her self upon her ingenuity in observing the letter, whilst she broke the spirit, of the treaty. A body of troops in the pay of France, though natives of Scotland, were entrusted with the custody of the town ; and the Princess, when reminded of her engagements, of which the real meaning, could not be easily mis understood, defended her conduct on the common and untenable maxim, that no faith was to be kept with heretics. These dishonourable proceedings, however, pro duced important effects, and were favourable to the 1 MS. Calderwood, vol. i. p. 324."], [157, "1559. 125 MARY. cause they were intended to destroy. The Earl of Argile and the Lord James, faithful to their promise, deserted the Regent, and departed secretly to St. Andrew's. Lord Ruthven, the Earl of Menteith, and Murray of Tullibarden, disgusted at the hypocrisy with which they had been treated, accompanied them ; and on receiving a summons from the Queen Dowager to repair instantly to Court on pain of her highest displeasure, they answered that they dared not, with a safe conscience, be partakers of the mani fest tyranny which was committed by her and her Council, the Prelates, against their brethren who professed a like faith with themselves1 (1st June, 1559). It was now no time for delay. Letters were despatched by Argile and the Lord James to the Lairds of Dun and Pitarrow, the Provost of Dundee, and others of their brethren, to assemble for the Reformation at St. Andrew's ; and on the 4th of June they were joined, not only by many devoted brethren, but by Knox, who, in the short interval between this and the treaty of Perth, had preached with great success in Fife. It is from this period of the assembly of the Pro testants at St. Andrew's, that we can discern the appearance of a new principle in their conduct. The defence of the country against the domination of the French troops, and the tyranny with which the Regent wielded her military power, became a paramount object in their proceedings. They began to have a \u2022 MS. Calder wood, vol. i. pp. 325, 326, 333, 334."], [158, "1559. 126 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. deeper insight than hitherto into the unprincipled schemes of France. In the efforts of the Queen to put down the Reformation, they believed that they saw a determination to overthrow the liberties of the country, and there can be little doubt, that whilst this feeling added strength to those whose predominating motive was the establishment of what they believed the truth, it induced others to join them, who under other circumstances would have remained quiet spec tators of the struggle. The zealous spirit and popular eloquence of Knox now found daily employment, and was followed by violent effects. After a sermon at Crail, a small sea town in Fife, in which he exhorted his hearers to die like men, or to live and be victorious in the great struggle in which they were engaged, the multitude demolished the altars and images in the church, and the same scenes were repeated after an equally stir ring address at Anstruther, another sea-port not far distant. But his greatest effort was reserved for St. Andrew's, the seat of the Metropolitan of Scotland, and the scene which was associated in the mind of the Reformer with his earliest labours and sufferings. The leaders of the Congregation, however, became apprehensive of the consequences which in this centre of Romish pomp might follow a public address. The Archbishop hearing that his cathedral was to be reformed, entered the town on Saturday evening with a hundred spears. He sent Colville of Cleish to inform Knox, that on his first appearance in the pulpit, he should be saluted"], [159, "1559 MARY 127 with a dozen culverins,1 and the Reformer was earnestly requested to be silent. But no persuasions of his friends, no threats of his enemies could shake his resolution. He ascended the pulpit, chose as the subject of his sermon that portion of Scripture which describes our Saviour driving the buyers and sellers out of the temple, and delivered an address in his usual strain of familiar and indignant eloquence. Whatever may have been his sentiments or those of the leaders of the Congregation as to the first excesses of the people, it was now evident that Knox, in a spirit of erroneous and misdirected zeal, no longer doubted that it was their duty, as professors of the truth, to put down by actual violence the idolatry which he condemned ; to hazard all the evils of civil war and popular commotion, rather than suffer the alleged abominations of the Romish Church and the tyranny of the French faction to pollute the faith and endanger the liberty of the country. Animated by this feeling, he drew a parallel between the abuses of the Jewish worship and the corruptions of Popery ; he explained to the magistrates and to the common alty that it was their duty to imitate Christ's example, and remove all monuments of idolatry, and so ready were they to follow his instructions, that the congre gation sallied from the sermon to the monasteries of the Dominican and Franciscan orders, and, encour aged by their chief magistrates, levelled these proud and wealthy edifices with the ground.2 1 MS.

In the midst of this destruction the Archbishop flew to the Queen, who lay with her Frenchmen at Falkland. Inflamed by his account of the riot, the Regent gave instant orders to advance upon St. Andrew's; and as Argile and the Lord James were but slenderly accompanied, she trusted to assemble an army and crush them before they could receive assistance. But here she was mistaken. On the first knowledge of their danger, men flocked in so rapidly that, to use Knox's phrase, \"they seemed to rain from the clouds,\"1 and when the Regent mus- tered her army, it was found that the Congregation, who had encamped on Couper Moor, greatly out- numbered her. It was evident, too, that there were experienced officers amongst them. Their ordnance was judiciously placed, and the ground occupied by their horse and their infantry chosen with considerable military skill. Fearful of attacking them with an inferior force, the Queen again entered into a negotia- tion, and a truce of eight days was agreed on. It was stipulated that no Frenchman should remain within the boundaries of Fife, except the garrisons which previous to the raising of the last army lay in some of the coast towns; and that certain noblemen, appointed by the Queen and Council, should meet the leaders of the Protestants to decide on the best method for the restoration of peace to the country. It was soon seen, however, that the single object of the Queen was to procure delay : no commissioners 1 Knox, pp. lJl, 152. MS. Caldervvood, vol. i. p. 327."], [161, "1559. 129 MARY. arrived at St. Andrew's, where the Lords of the Con gregation for some days anxiously expected them. Accounts were brought in the mean time of the tyranny exercised by Charters, the Provost, and the garrison in Perth; and the Protestants, pitying the condition of their brethren who had been driven from their houses to subsist on the charity of their friends, determined to assemble in force and expel the foreign troops from this city. Late events had taught them their own strength ; habits of discipline, watchfulness, and active communication had been introduced by that sense of mutual danger which is the best instructor ; and Sir William Kirkaldy of Grange, a soldier of great military experience and undaunted determination, had joined their party at this con juncture. His accession was of much importance to the Congregation, and appears to have been the result rather of a wish to rescue his native country from becoming an appanage of France, than of a determination to overthrow the Romish faith. As early at least as March 1st, 1557, he had expressed himself with the utmost indignation against the yoke of the Frenchmen, and had offered his services to restore Scotland to its former liberty, and to promote an amity with England.1 Intimation had been sent to the brethren (so the Congregation were generally termed by their minis - 1 Sir N.

On his refusal, and after a vain attempt by the Regent to procure delay, the batteries were opened by Lord Ruthven on the west, and the citizens of Dundee who lay on the east quarter. It was evident, after the first dis charge, that resistance would be vain, and the garri son, having stipulated that they should march out with military honours, delivered the town to the Congregation, on Saturday the 25th of June.1 This success, owing to the strength and importance of Perth, at that time one of the few fortified towns in Scotland, was highly encouraging to the Protest ants. On the Sabbath which succeeded the capitu lation, public thanksgiving was returned to God for their victory ; England, it was hoped, would espouse their cause more openly, and Knox, whose work against female sovereigns, or as he termed it, the \"Monstrous Regiment\" of women, had made him odious to Elizabeth, addressed a remarkable letter to Secretary Cecil, in which he endeavoured to deprecate her resentment. He intended to have inclosed at the same time an epistle to the Queen herself, but this he delayed, owing to the sudden departure of the mes senger. \" I understand,\" said he, in that honest and 1 MS.

Why, that either her Grace, either that the faithful in her realm, should repute me as an enemy, I know no just cause. One thing I know, that England by me this day hath received no hurt, yea, it hath received by the power of God working in me, that benefit which yet to none in England is known, neither yet list I to boast of the same ; only this will I say, that when England and the usurped authority thereof was enemy to me, yet was 1 friend to it, and the fruit of my friendship saved the borders in their greatest necessities.

The truth is, that many of the nobility, the most part of barons and gentlemen, with many towns and one city, have put to their hands to remove idolatry and the monuments of the same. The Reformation is somewhat violent, because the adversaries be stub bom ; none that professeth Christ Jesus with us usurpeth anything against the authorities, neither yet intendeth to usurp, unless strangers be brought in to subdue and bring in bondage the liberties of this poor country ; if any such thing be espied, I am un certain what shall follow.\"1 The Lords of the Congregation were now to dis cover, that it is infinitely more easy to excite, than to direct or to check the fury of the people. In the immediate vicinity of Perth, was the ancient Abbey Church of Scone, regarded with peculiar reverence, as the spot in which for many centuries the Scottish monarchs had held the ceremony of their coronation. Beside it stood the palace of the Bishop of Moray, a prelate of profligate life, and hated by the men of Dundee, as a chief instrument in the martyrdom of Walter Mill. It was thought proper, therefore, that some \" order'' should be taken with him, and a mes sage was sent by the leaders of the Congregation, requiring him to join them with his servants, other wise they would neither spare nor save his abbey. He consented to this, and added, that not only would he meet them with all his force, but vote with them 1 MS. Letter, State P. Off, 28th June, 1559.

But before this answer arrived, the citizens of Dundee had seized their weapons, and rushed forward to the abbey, fol lowed by Knox and their chief magistrate, who in vain attempted to restrain them. It was the earnest wish of the Reformer and of the leaders of the Pro testants, to save both the palace and the abbey, and in this they at first so far succeeded, that nothing but the images were pulled down ; Argile and Mur ray then drew off the multitude, and receiving intelli gence in the evening that the Queen Regent meditated to garrison Stirling, and pre-occupy the pax\u00abses of the Forth, so as to prevent a junction between the northern reformers and their lowland brethren, these two leaders made a rapid night march, took possession of the town, and, according to the expres sion then commonly used, purged it of idolatry. Their absence was fatal to Scone : some of the poor, in hope of spoil, and others with a lingering wish of vengeance, returned on the morrow and began to prowl about the abbey \u2014 the Prelate in the interval had barricaded his mansion, his servants had armed themselves, and a citizen of Dundee approaching near the \" Girnel \" or granary, was thrust through with a rapier by one, reported to be a son of the Prelate. In a moment all was tumult, the air rung with shouts and cries of vengeance\u2014 the story flew to Perth \u2014 a multitude which no power could control attacked the ecclesiastical palace and the abbey\u2014 and within a few hours, both were in flames :* many, even 1 MS.

The intelligence of this movement gave fresh spirits to the reformers, and having taken possession of Linlithgow, pulled down the images and destroyed the relics, they entered Edinburgh in triumph on the 29th of June 1559. 1 MS.

In the eye of the law, they had gone too far in resistance to dream of retreat, and considera tions of safety urged them to press forward in the work which they had begun. It becomes an interest ing inquiry at this moment, what was the exact object which they proposed to themselves, and fortunately we have their own evidence upon the sub ject. In an original letter from Sir William Kirkaldy of Grange, one of the ablest leaders of the Protest ants, written to Sir Henry Percy the day after they entered Edinburgh, he thus speaks, \"I received your"], [168, "1559. 136 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. letter this last of June, perceiving thereby the doubt and suspicion you stand in for the coming forward of the Congregation, whom I assure you, you need not to have in suspicion, for they mean nothing but re- formation of religion, which shortly throughout the realm they will bring to pass, for the Queen and Monsieur D'Osell, with all the Frenchmen, for refuge are retired to Dunbar. The foresaid Congregation came this last of June, by three of the clock to Edinburgh, where they will take order for the main- tenance of the true religion and resisting of the King* of France, if he sends any force against them.* * The manner of their proceeding in reformation, is this : they pull down all manner of Friaries, and some Ab- beys, which willingly receive not the Reformation. As to parish churches, they cleanse them of images and all other monuments of idolatry, and command that no masses be said in them \u2014 in place thereof, the Book set forth by godly King Edward is read in the same churches. They have never as yet meddled with a pennyworth of that which pertains to the Church, but presently they will take order throughout all the parts where they dwell, that all the fruits of the abbeys and other churches shall be kept and bestowed upon the faithful ministers, until such time as a further order be taken. Some suppose the Queen, seeing no other remedy, will follow their desires, which is a general reformation throughout the whole realm, conform to the pure word of God, and the Frenchmen to be sent away.

He intreated, that through them a correspondence might be opened betwixt the faithful in both realms. \" The troubles of this realm,\" says he, \" you hear, but the cause to many is not known. Persuade yourself, and assure others, that we mean neither sedition neither yet rebellion against any just and lawful authority, but only the advance ment of Christ's religion, and the liberty of this poor realm. If we can have the one with the other, it will fare better with England ; which if we lack, although we mourn and smart, England will not escape without worse trouble.\"2 Soon after this Kirkaldy had a private meeting with Percy at Norham. The interview took place with the con currence and under the directions of Cecil, and the Scottish Baron having* explained more fully the in tentions of the Protestants, returned to them with the grateful intelligence that England was disposed to favour their views, and to enter into a league with i MS.

The news was received with much exultation, and Grange, in a letter addressed to the English secretary, declares that \" all Europe shall know that a league made in the name of God hath another foundation and assurance, than pactions made by man for worldly commodity.\"1 There is every reason to believe that these letters contain an honest statement of the views of the Cono-resation. The establishment of the reformed religion in opposition to the Romish faith, the ex pulsion of the French troops from Scotland, and the conclusion of a league, offensive and defensive, with Elizabeth, were the great objects which they pro posed to themselves. Nor, although they had agreed and acted upon the necessity of pulling down all religious houses which adhered to the ancient faith, were they as deeply inimical to prelacy at this moment as they became not long after. They used the Service-book of King Ed ward the Sixth,2 an extraordinary circumstance when we consider the violent opposition raised by Knox against this same form of Liturgy, only a few years before, at Frankfort.

Their great fear was the arrival of a new army from France ; they knew the warlike levies which in that country were preparing against them ; they dreaded the desertion of some amongst them selves, whose poverty exposed them to corruption ;' and they were so well aware of the extreme caution and parsimony which marked the policy of Elizabeth, that they could not look with much confidence to her assistance, either in men or money. Still they did not despair. The people were in their favour, the most powerful amongst the barons had espoused their cause, and Cecil's politics, though timid, were decidedly opposed to the establishment of anything* like a permanent French influence in Scotland. The Congregation, however, had a formidable enemy in the Queen Regent. Could she but tem porise and procure delay, she reckoned with confi dence on the arrival of a large auxiliary force from France, and former experience had shown, that against this the irregular feudal infantry which the Scottish barons brought into the field, was unable to contend for any length of time. She spread reports that her adversaries contemplated not only an alteration of the established religion, but a more daring change : that their great leader, the Lord 1 MS. Letter, S. P. Off.

James, aspired to the Crown, and that under pretence of religious reformation, they sought to overturn the existing government.1 A proclamation to this effect was made in the name of Francis and Mary, King and Queen of Scotland : \u2014 It arraigned the Protestants of sedition \u2014 accused them of having seized the irons of the Mint, and of maintaining a correspondence with England \u2014 and commanded all, under pain of treason, to depart from the capital, which they had violently entered. It declared at the same time, that the Regent had already offered to call a parliament, in which, by the advice of the estates of the realm, a universal order in religion should be established, and in the meantime had given a full liberty of conscience to her subjects. These representations produced a considerable effect. The Duke of Chastelherault. fell off from the Congregation \u2014 others grew lukewarm in the cause, and the leaders trembled for the overthrow of their party. In a letter to the Queen they repudiated with indignation the charge of rebellion \u2014 declared they would, in civil matters, conduct themselves as obedient subjects, and professed their sole object to be the promotion of God's glory, the defence of their preachers, and the destruction of idolatry.2 An attempt was soon after made to compose matters by negotiation, and Commissioners from both sides met at Preston in Midlothian, but the Regent insisted not only that she should have the free exer- 'Keith, p. 95. 2 Ibid. p. 95."], [173, "1559. 141 MARY. cise of her mass, but that wherever she came, the Protestant preachers should be silent. To the last condition, which they justly contended would leave them without a church at all, it was impossible for the Lords of the Congregation to agree ; yet fearful of coming to extremities, they prolonged the confer ences, and evinced an earnest desire for peace. This, however, did not prevent them from sending a letter to Queen Elizabeth, and at the same moment a more impassioned epistle to Cecil. This crafty Minister had comforted them by promises of assistance, should they be invaded by any foreign power, and had re quested them to explain fully the purposes for which they had taken arms. \" Our whole purpose,\" say they in reply, \" is, as knoweth God, to advance the glory of Christ Jesus, and the true preaching of his Evangile within this realm- \u2014 to remove superstition and all sorts of external idolatry \u2014 to bridle to our power the fury of those that have cruelly shed the blood of our brethren, and to our uttermost to main tain the liberty of this our country from the tyranny and thraldom of strangers.\"1 The Minister of Elizabeth, however, had pressed them upon a delicate point \u2014 the allegation of the Queen Regent that they intended not only a change of religion but of govern ment. Their reply is remarkable. \" True it is,\" they observe, \" that as yet we have made no mention 1 MS. Letter, St. P.

But perceiving that France, the Queen Regent here, together with her priests and Frenchmen, pretend nothing else but the suppressing of Christ's Evangile, the maintenance of idolatry, the ruin of us, and the utter subversion of this poor realm, we are fully purposed to seek the next remedy\u2014 to withstand their tyranny, in which matter we unfeignedly require your faithful counsel and furtherance at the Queen and Council's hands, for our assistance.''1 Along with these letters, Knox addressed an apologetic epistle to Elizabeth, in which he declared that her displeasure conceived against him was a burden so grievous and in tolerable, that, but for the testimony of a clean conscience, he would have sunk in desperation. It did not suit the policy of Cecil, in the uncertain state of the contest between the reformers and the Romish party, to grant them immediate assistance, still less did he wish to see them put down, and peace established ; and with this object of delay he directed a remarkable letter to the Cono*reoation, in which he incited them to continue the struggle, and to weaken their principal enemies, the Popish clergy, by despoiling them of their riches. \" Ye know,\" said he, \" your chief adversaries, the Popish kirkmen, be noted wise in their generation, they be rich also, 1 MS.

The Regent, for her part, permitted to the citizens of Edinburgh the free choice of their religion, gave full liberty of speech to the preachers, and promised that no persons should be molested, either in their persons or estate, on account of their faith. It was lastly stipulated, that no men-of-war, either French or Scots, should be placed in garrison within the town.1 Such were the conditions agreed on and signed by the Duke, the Earl of Huntly, and D'Osell, to whom the negotiation was entrusted by both parties. It is asserted, however, by Knox,2 that these were not the articles to which the brethren consented, and before leaving the town they issued a proclamation, in which they craftily omitted every thing which would have been prejudicial to their own party, and added some conditions not to be found in the written appoint ment.3 On neither side was this convention expected to lead to any permanent pacification. The Regent was now in daily hopes of having speedy succour from France. Her representations of the state of Scot land had produced a strong sensation in that country; and Sir James Melvil, who had been brought up from early youth in the service of the constable Montmorency, was sent from Paris on a secret mis- 1 Keith, p. 99. 2 Knox 166. 3 Keith, p. 99.

Melvil was, probably, from his connexion with the constable, predisposed to favour the cause of the Congregation, and the manner in which he executed his commission argues either extreme simplicity, or a predetermination not to seek the truth. On his arrival repairing to the Lord James he interrogated him whether he meditated any designs against the throne ; and being assured by this able leader that nothing could be farther from his intention; his desire, and that of his asso ciates, being only to obtain liberty of conscience, the ambassador returned through England into France perfectly satisfied upon the subject.1 That Murray at this moment encouraged any such daring project may be doubted, but certainly he was not likely to criminate himself upon so serious an accusation. The death of Henry the Second of France took place during this mission, and on his return to France Melvil found the Guises triumphant, and nothing but threats of war and vengeance against the party of the Congregation in Scotland. Nor could this change of views remain for any time a secret in that country, or in the Court of Elizabeth. The Protestant faction in France kept up an intimate and constant 1 Melvil's Memoirs.

Cecil, by his secret agents, was fully informed of the intrigues of the French Cabinet, and both were prepared to watch and to resist, when necessary, the meditated designs, not only against the reformed opinions, but against England itself. Previous to their leaving the capital, in conformity to the late convention, the brethren proclaimed by sound of trumpet the conditions which they had accepted, and added, that if any of these should be violated, the leaders of the party would assist their friends as they had already done, with their whole power, and zealously contend for the glory of God, and the relief and defence of every member of the true Congregation1 (25th July, 1559). From Edinburgh, the chiefs of the Protestants retired to Stirling, where, dreading the craft of their adversaries, who had endeavoured to sow jealousies amongst them, they entered into a new bond (August 1st, 1559), by which they engaged that none of them should receive any message from the Regent, without imparting it to the rest, and holding a consultation on the proposals it con veyed.2 From the same city Knox was despatched to Berwick, where he had a secret interview with Sir James Crofts, the governor. It appears from the original instructions committed to this indefatigable 1 MS. St. P. Off. Proclamation of the Congregation, Edin. 25th July, 1559.

He proposed to seize and garrison Stirling, provided the English would send money for the payment of the troops, describing it as \"the key and principal place\" which might separate the northern part of the king- dom from the south. He represented that some as- sistance by sea would be required for the safety of Dundee and Perth, and suggested the fortification of Broughty Craig, to which work the barons in its neighbourhood, who were zealous for the Re- formation, would give every assistance. He pointed out the necessity of the fort of Aymouth being seized by England, to prevent its occupation by the French, and he required the Queen's Majesty to influence the Kers, Homes, and other borderers, in favour of the reformers. Under the term \" comfortable sup- port,\"' which the Congregation looked for from Elizabeth, he. explained, that not only soldiers must be sent, and men and ships be ready to assist them if assaulted, but \" that some respect must be had to some of the nobility, who were not able to sustain such households as now, in the beginning of these troubles were requisite, \u2014 the practice of the Queen Regent being* to stir up enemies against every noble- man, even in the parts where he remaineth.\" In plainer terms, the Scottish nobility who had joined the cause of the Congregation, were anxious, like their predecessors under Henry the Eighth, to receive pensions from England. On such conditions, the reformers, he declared, were ready to enter into a strict and solemn league with Elizabeth, to bind"], [181, "1559 149 MARY themselves to be enemies to enemies, and friends to friends, and never to agree with France without the consent of that princess ; he lastly observed, that although the league was as yet only proposed to the Privy Council of Scotland, so anxiously was it desired by the whole barons, that they accused the Council of neglig-ence for having: so lono delayed it.1 In this mission, Knox, who was accompanied by Alexander Whitelaw, a zealous adherent of the party, incurred considerable personal risk, their little con voy having been furiously attacked by the French garrison of Dunbar. He returned however, to Stir ling in safety, but mortified by the cold and dilatory policy of Elizabeth, who, whilst she avoided giving them immediate assistance, did not scruple to throw suspicion upon their motives, and to act with an inconsistency and mystery, which put them at fault. She addressed a letter to the Queen Dowager, full of the most earnest wishes for the preservation of peace between the two countries ; yet she accused the leaders of the Conm-ea-ation of lukewarmness and inactivity in not rising against her authority, expres sing* her astonishment that they had not more vigo- 1 MS.

It was her desire, as far as we can discover it, to incite them to revolt against the estab lished government, but herself to incur no expense or risk. In her instructions to Sir Ralph Sadler, whom at this time (8th Aug. 1559) she determined to send on a mission into Scotland, he was directed to \" nourish the faction betwixt the Scots and the French, so that the French may be better occupied with them, and less busy with England. Whilst he was to explore the very truth, whether the Lord James did mean any enterprise towards the Crown of Scotland for himself, or not.'\" These strange delays and suspicions irritated the reformers ; and their leaders, the Lord James and the Eail of Argile, addressed letters of remonstrance to Crofts, governor of Berwick, and to Cecil, in which they complained of the treatment they had experienced. To be judged slow, negligent, and cold in their proceedings, gave them, they declared, great distress. \" Ye are not ignorant, Sir,\" said they, addressing Crofts, \" how difficult it is to persuade a multitude to the revolt of an authority established. The last time that we were pursued, our enemies were in number thrice more than we, besides that the Castle of Edinburgh declared plain enemy to us at our uttermost necessity, which was one cause of our appointment* *.

The establish ment of the Reformation, according to the model dictated by the stern anti-prelatical opinions of Knox, was not the aim to which she directed her efforts ; she hated the man,3 and considered the book which he had written against female government, an auda cious and inexpiable offence ; no concessions or 1 MS.

Nor is this any matter of wonder, when we consider that the individual attachments of this Princess were strongly on the side of Romanism, and that Knox considered the Reformation in England as scarcely one remove from Popery. But although lukewarm in the cause of the Reformation, and desirous of peace with France, she was well aware of the gigantic schemes of ambition, conceived by the House of Guise. Her jealousy had been roused to the last degree by the attack upon her right to the throne and assumption of her arms and title, which had been early made by the Queen of Scots, and she dreaded the effect which the establishment of French influence and the overthrow of the party of the Congregation, must produce upon the great body of her Romish subjects in England and Ireland. Under these circumstances, without actually breaking with France, she encouraged the Protest ants to revolt against the authority of the Queen Dowager, and in reply to their repeated ap plications for money, Cecil hinted in his letters, as we have already seen, that they ought not to neglect the opportunity now afforded them, to strip the Romish Church of its pomp and wealth, and apply \"good things to good uses.\"1 It is important to attend 1 MS.

But, consider, Sir, that we have against us the established authority, which did ever savour you and Denmark both, in all your reformations, and therefore, that without support, we cannot bring them to such obedience as we desire.

Some little time before (19th July, 1559,) they had declared in their letter to Cecil, that any altera- 1 This alludes to the instructions quoted above in p. 149, dated 31st July, 1559- MS. St. P.

They had earnestly laboured to seduce the Duke of Chastelherault from his allegiance, with a view, probably, of restoring him to the Regency \u2014 they had established a Council, and only waited a full agree ment with England to depose the Queen Dowager from her authority, and substitute some more favoured individual of their own party in her stead. Who this should be was a question which did not fail to present itself to the English Court, and Elizabeth seems to have looked to two noble persons. The first was the Earl of Arran, eldest son to the Duke of Chastelherault, next heir to the Crown after the young Queen, and lately Captain of the Scottish Guard in France. Having embraced the opinions of the reformers, and engaged in intrigues with Eng land, he had become an object of suspicion to the French government, which had stript him of his pre ferments, and was about to throw him into prison when he escaped to Geneva. It had early occurred to Cecil that the presence of this young nobleman in Scotland would be useful as a check on the influ-"], [187, "1559. 155 MARY. ence of the Queen Dowager. Letters were, therefore, sent to recal him home, and every means taken to per suade his father, to resist the Regent. In Elizabeth's instructions to Sir Ralph Sadler, when she was about to send him into that country (8th August, 1559,) this Minister was directed to exhort the Duke for \" preservation of the expectant interest which he hath to the Crown, if God call the young Queen before she have issue, to withstand (resist) the governance of that realm by any other than the blood of Scot land.\" He was directed to quote the late example of the King of Spain, who, although husband to the Queen of England, committed no charge of any manner of office, spiritual or temporal to a stranger \u2014 and of his father Charles the Fifth, who governed his countries of Flanders and Brabant by their own nation, and to warn Arran that the French, under pretence of putting down the Reformation would never be satisfied till they had subjugated the realm, and utterly extirpated his house.1 Neither the Duke, however, nor his son the Earl of Arran, pos sessed abilities sufficient for the high and difficult part thus allotted to them.

All this weakness, however, was not yet discovered, and for the present he was employed and flattered with the hopes of advancement. But Elizabeth, and still more, her able Minister Cecil, had their eye upon another and a very different person, the Lord James, natural son of James the Fifth, and regarded even at this time, when he had not completed his twenty-sixth year,1 as the most influential man in the Congregation. There is every reason to believe that his attachment to the principles of the Reformation was sincere, and that at first he proposed no other end in taking so prominent a lead than to procure liberty of con science, and the free exercise of his religion for himself and his adherents. But personal ambition and the love of power were deeply planted in Murray's character \u2014 his mind wras one of no ordinary cast, and when he began to busy himself in public life, a very short period sufficed to make him feel his talents, and take pleasure in the eminence they con ferred upon him. Educated for the Church, first in his own country, and afterwards at the schools in France, he acquired habits of study, and a cultivation i MS. Letter, St. P. Off. Randolph to Killigrew.

He had early attached to himself some of those able and unscrupulous men, who at this time were to be found in the professions of the law, or in the Church \u2014 men who combined the craft and intri gue of civilised life, with the ferocity of a still feudal age; but whilst he used their assistance, his own powers of application were so great, as scarcely to re quire it; his acquaintance with European politics, superior to most of those with whom he acted, ena bled him to transact business, and conduct his corre spondence with uncommon clearness, brevity and precision ; his knowledge of human nature was profound, he possessed that rapid intuitive insight into the dispositions of those with whom he acted, which taught him to select with readiness, and to employ with success, those best calculated to carry forward his designs, and it was his peculiar art to appear to do nothing, whilst, in truth, he did all. There was a bluntness, openness and honesty about his manner, which disarmed suspicion and dis posed men to unbosom themselves to him with equal readiness and sincerity ; yet when the conference was ended, they were often surprised to find that the confi dence had been altogether on one side \u2014 they had re vealed their own purposes, and Murray, with all his apparent frankness, had betrayed none of his secrets. There is perhaps no kind of man more dangerous in public life, than he who conceals matured purposes, under a negligent and careless exterior : if to this we add, that his talents in war were of a superior order"], [190, "1559 158 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. \u2022 \u2014 that he was brave, almost to rashness, that his address was dignified, and his countenance noble and kingly, we shall be at no loss to comprehend the ex traordinary influence which he had acquired, not only over his own party, but in England and on the continent. It had begun to be whispered in France, as we have seen, and at the English Court, that Murray aimed secretly at the Crown. When Cecil drew up his instructions for Sir Ralph Sadler, he was directed to investigate whether the Lord James, whose power with the Congregation appeared to be daily on the increase, did really look so high, and it was added, \"if he do, and the Duke be found very cold in his own causes, it shall not be amiss to let him follow his own device therein, without dissuading or per suading him anything therein.\"1 A letter written a few days after this by Knox to Sir Wm. Cecil, describes the condition of the reformed party, and their anxiety for assistance from England, in strong terms. \"The case of these gentlemen standeth thus, that unless without delay money be furnished to pay their soldiers, who in number are now but five hun dred, for their service by past, and to retain another thousand footmen, with three hundred horsemen for a time, they will be compelled every man to seek the next way for his own safety. I am assured (as flesh may be of flesh) that some of them will take a very hard life before that ever they compone either with the Queen 2 MS St. P. Off, 8th August 1559.

Lord Bettancourt bragged in his credit after he had delivered his menacing letter to the Prior, that the King and his Council would spend the Crown of France, unless they had our full obe dience, I am assured, that unless they had a farther respect, they would not buy our poverty at that price. They labour to corrupt some of our great men with money, and some of our number are so poor, as before I wrote, that without support they cannot serve.

Sir Ralph Sadler was sent to Berwick for the pur pose of managing the correspondence between the reformers and the English Court (20 August, 1559). He assured them of immediate pecuniary assistance, and carried with him three thousand pounds,2 which Elizabeth directed to be applied with such secrecy and discretion, as not to impair the treaties of peace lately concluded with Scotland.3 On his arrival, he found a messenger from Knox, by whom he was assured, that if the Queen would furnish them with money to pay a body of fifteen hundred arque buses, and three hundred horse, they would soon not 1 Original MS.

I have gone into greater length in this part of the History, which involves the causes and motives connected with the early annals of the Reformation, because many of the letters which I have given, were unknown to Dr. M'Crie, others have been printed in his Life of Knox, but in correctly, with many passages omitted, (owing to his not having had the originals before him), and the period, one of great import ance, has been far too slightly treated by our general historians. 2 As to the mode in which the money was to be advanced to the Protestants, see Sadler, vol. i. p. 439. 8 Sadler's St. P. by Scott, vol. i. pp. 392, 399-"], [193, "1559 161 MARY only expel the French from Scotland, but achieve their whole purpose.1 Some little time after this (8th September), Balnevis, a zealous adherent of the Congregation and an intimate friend of Knox, repaired privately to Berwick, where he held a long consulta tion with Sir Ralph Sadler, and fully explained the views of the Protestants. He assured them that the breach between them and the Queen Regent was now incurable ; that having advanced so far in their resistance, they must go forward with the matter or lose their lives ; that whatever pretence they made, the principal mark they shot at was to introduce an alteration of the state, and authority, to depose the Regent, place the supreme power in the hands of the Duke or his son, the Earl of Arran, and then enter into open treaty with England accord ing to the exigency of the case. So well satisfied was Sadler with the representations of this zealous partizan, that he paid him two thousand pounds, to be delivered to the leaders of the Congregation for the maintenance of their troops, and assured him that some steps should be taken for the relief of Kirkaldy, Ormeston, Whitelaw, and others. These men, it appears, were in distress, owing to the sums they had already spent in this service, and to their pensions from France having been stopped since they had taken part with the Congregation.2 It happened by a singular coincidence, that whilst 1 Ibid. p. 400. s Sadler, vol. i. pp. 434, 435.

It was judged right, however, that they should meet, and after a brief but joyful inter view, Balnevis departed, under cover of night, to Holy Island ; from which, carrying the money with him, he arrived at the head-quarters of the Congre gation. Arran, having disguised himself, assumed the name of Monsieur de Beaufort, and passed into Teviotdale, from whence he was conducted to his father in the castle of Hamilton.1 Yet all this was transacted, according to the express directions of Cecil, with such secrecy, that for sometime it was unknown he was in Scotland. (16th September, 1559.)- This assistance from Elizabeth came very oppor tunely to enable the Congregation to resist the decided measures of France and the Queen Regent. In the beginning* of August, the Sieur de Bettan court had arrived from the French Court. He assured the Queen that an army, commanded by her brother the Marquess D'Elbeuf, would speedily embark for Scotland. He brought letters from the King and Queen of France to the Lord James, whom they regarded as the chief leader of the Protestants 1 Sadler, vol. i. pp. 435,450, 461. J For Arran's arrival, see Sadler, vol. i. p. 447."], [195, "1559 MARY 163 They reminded him of the benefits he had received from France, upbraided him with his ingratitude, and threatened him with absolute ruin if he persisted in his rebellious courses. To these accusations Murray directed a temperate, though an insincere reply. He professed himself to be solely actuated by a zeal for the truth and the glory of God ; and he declared for himself and the rest of the Conoreo-a tion, that, except upon the subject of religion, they would be faithful to their sovereign, and detested the crime of sedition.1 Preparations for war now rapidly advanced. In the end of August a force of a thousand men, under the command of an Italian officer named Octavian, had disembarked at Leith, and with these the Queen Dowager began to entrench and fortify that port. She despatched their leader back to France, with an earnest request for a larger reinforcement. She warned the French Court that her adversaries were in active correspondence with England, Germany, and Denmark ; stated the necessity for immediate activity, before they were allowed to concentrate their strength ; and assured them, that with four ships of war to cruise in the Firth, an additional thousand men and a hundred barbed horse, she would under take to reduce the kingdom to peace.2 This, how ever, was not so easily effected. The people had been long dissatisfied with the French troops, whose stay in Scotland was expensive and troublesome. 1 Knox, p. 161. Spottiswood, p. 131. \" Keith, p. 102. M 2"], [196, "1559. 164 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. .The partiality of the Regent to her own nation had excited disgust ; the reformed preachers perambulated the country, and in their discourses won the people to their devotion, not only on the great subject of religion, but so eloquently declaimed against the alleged conspiracy of the Regent for the subjugation of the realm under a foreign yoke, that the arrival of a new auxiliary force was viewed with the utmost jealousy and aversion.1 A more pacific mission, indeed, succeeded this warlike demonstration, con sisting of the Bishop of Amiens and two learned doctors of the Sorbonne ; but although this foreign prelate came as legate- a-latere from the Pope, and his companions earnestly laboured to reconcile the reformers to the ancient faith, their united efforts to \"purge the church and the people from heretical pollutions \" were unavailing. Nor was the Legate completely a messenger of peace ; for along with him came La Brosse, a French officer, two hundred men,2 and a company of eighty horse.3 Both sides now resolved on war ; and on the arrival of Arran, a secret consultation having been held at Hamilton with the principal leaders of the Congre gation/ the Duke, who had hitherto been neutral, 1 Calig.

This chal lenge on the part of the reformers was premature and ill-judged. They could not, at the earliest, assemble their whole force before the 15th of October; they were not certain of a second supply of money from England ; the Duke, although now one of their party, was timid and irresolute ; Argile was occupied with Maconnell in his own country ; and Huntly, although disposed to favour their proceedings, was not yet separated entirely from the Queen Regent. Instead, therefore, of being able to follow up their warlike message by any hostile attack, they contented them selves with the occupation of Broughty Craig, a strong fortified castle in the mouth of the Tay, and granted a commission to Glencairn and Erskine of Dun to recommence their proceedings against the religious houses, by suppressing and purging of idolatry the abbey of Pasley.2 1 MS.

Soon after this their cause gained an important 'accession. Thomas Randall or Randolph, who had become acquainted with the Earl of Arran, at Geneva, at the earnest request of this young noble man was sent after him into Scotland. What was the particular tie which attached so able and busy an intriguer as Randolph to the fortunes of Arran, does not appear, but Cecil lost no time in seconding his wishes, and the presence of this English agent, who arrived with much secrecy at Hamilton in the end of September,1 was of essential service in imparting energy and promptitude to the measures of the re formers. But this was not all, Maitland of Lethingtom the Secretary to the Queen Regent, a man whose talents as a statesman were of the highest order, and who had long professed himself a friend to the re formed doctrines, now secretly joined their party, and although he openly adhered to the Queen, betrayed her councils and most private affairs to her enemies. Matters now proceeded with more decision and rapidity.2 On the 15th of October, the Congrega tion assembled their force, it amounted to twelve thousand men, and next day they advanced to Edin burgh which they occupied without resistance, the Regent having retired within the fortifications of Leith. One Council for civil affairs and another for matters of religion was then appointed.3 In the 1 Sadler, vol. i. p. 474. 2 Ibid. p. 498. MS. Calderwood, vol. i. p. 383. 4 Orig. St. P. Off.

The second for religion embraced Knox, Goodman, and the Bishop of Galloway, who had renounced his Romish errors and embraced the principles of the Protestants. They next addressed a letter to the Queen, requiring her instantly to command all foreigners and men-at-arms to depart from the town of Leith, and leave it free and open to the subjects of the realm. She replied, that their letter appeared from its tone rather to come from a prince to his subjects than from subjects to a prince, that it was ridiculous to talk of foreigners making a conquest of the realm, since Frenchmen were naturalized subjects, and Scotland united to France by marriage, and she concluded by commanding the Duke and his com pany, under pain of treason, to depart from the capital. The Lord Lion who brought this message from the Queen was requested to await his answer, and the whole Congregation, consisting of the nobles, barons, and burgesses of their faction, assembled in the Tolbooth of the city on the 21st of October. At this meeting the question of the deposition of the Regent was debated with great solemnity. It was urged by Lord Ruthven, who was chosen pre sident, that since she, who was not their natural born sovereign, but only a Regent, had contemptuously"], [200, "1559. 168 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. refused the requests of those who by birth were councillors of the realm, and since her pretences threatened to bring the Commonwealth into bondage, she ought no longer to be permitted to domineer over them. He proposed, therefore, that she should be deposed, and much diversity of opinion having been expressed, they requested the advice of their preachers. On this delicate subject much thought and dis cussion had already taken place. We have seen, indeed, that the deprivation of the Queen, and the alteration of the civil government, had been contem plated some time before. Willock spoke first, and having enlarged on the Divine Ordinance of Magis tracy, he stated its limitations by the word of God, and quoted the examples of the depositions of Kings which occurred in the Scriptures ; he then adverted to the oppression inflicted on them by the Queen Regent, whom he denominated an open and obstinate idolatress. She had refused them justice, she had invaded their liberties, she had prevented the preach ing of God's word, and had not scrupled to declare that their country was no longer a free and inde pendent realm, but an appanage of France. Such being her conduct, he could see no reason why they, the born councillors of the realm, should scruple to divest her of all authority amongst them.1 This judgment was corroborated, though somewhat more guardedly, by Knox. He approved, he said, of the 1 Keith, pp. 104, 105."], [201, "1559 169 MARY sentiments of his brother, but warned them that no malversation of the Regent ought to withdraw their hearts from the obedience due to their sovereigns, and protested that they ought deeply to examine their own motives. If, he said, the present grave and momentous proceeding originated not from the desire to preserve their Commonwealth, but was dictated by private malice and envy, they need not expect to escape the wrath of God ; and lastly, he observed, that upon her repentance and submission to the nobility, they were undoubtedly bound to restore her to the same honours of which she was now de prived.1 Such being the decision of their ministers the votes of the assembly were individually taken ; it was resolved without a dissenting voice, that the Regent should be suspended from her authority, and the act for this purpose was immediately drawn up, and proclaimed publicly to the people. (2*2nd Oct.) It remained only to communicate it to the Regent, and for this purpose a letter was addressed to her and delivered to the Lion herald. It informed her that they had received her message, and understood from the terms in which it was conceived her deter mined opposition to the glory of God, the liberty of the realm, and the welfare of the nobles ; for saving of which, it continued, we have in our Sovereign Lord and Lady's name suspended your commission, and all administration of the policy your Grace may pretend thereby, being most assuredly persuaded > MS. Calderwood, vol. i. p. 386, 387, and Caligula, B. x. sol. 42."], [202, "1559. 170 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. that your proceedings are direct contrary to our Sovereign Lord and Lady's will, whom we ever esteem to be for the weal and not for the hurt of this our Commonweal. And, it proceeded, \" as your Grace will not acknowledge us, our Sovereign Lord and Lady's true barons, for your subjects and council, no more will we acknowledge you for any Regent or lawful Magistrate unto us. Seeing if any authority ye have by reason of our Sovereign's commission granted unto your Grace, the same for most weighty reasons is worthily suspended by us, by name and authority of our sovereigns, whose council we are, of native birth, in the affairs of this our Common weal.\"1 It must be admitted, that this violent and unprece dented measure, although attempted to be concealed under the name and authority of the Sovereign, was an act of open rebellion \u2014 to attempt to justify their proceedings under the allegation that they were born councillors of the realm, was a specious but unsound pretence. Their birth entitled some of them to sit in Parliament, but could never bestow upon them the power to constitute themselves a self- elected council, without the intervention of the royal authority or any meeting of the three estates. Having, however, thus boldly begun, it was judged right to proceed in the same strain ; on the 25th a herald was sent to sum mon all French and Scottish soldiers to leave the town of Leith, within twelve hours ; this being disre garded, preparations were made for the assault, and 1 Keith, p. 105,"], [203, "1559. 171 .MARY. scaling ladders were ordered to be prepared in the aisles of the High Church of St. Giles, much to the annoyance of the preachers, who predicted that an enterprise begun in sacrilege, must end in defeat.1 Nor was it long before these gloomy anticipations were fulfilled. The money given to Balnevis, and a small additional sum brought by Randolph, was now spent \u2014 the soldiers of the Congregation clamoured for pay, and breaking into mutiny offered their ser vices to any Romish or Protestant master who would pay them their wages \u2014 the army, lately twelve thou sand strong, but composed of inferior vassals, who could not remain long in the field, diminished daily ; consternation seized the minds of their leaders, and it was evident that without additional assistance their great enterprise was at an end. To comfort them, Elizabeth, at the earnest entreaties of Cecil, forgot her parsimony, and entrusted four thousand pounds to Cockburn, of Ormeston, a zealous adherent of the cause, who undertook the dangerous commission of carrying* it to head quarters, but he was waylaid, wounded, and robbed of the whole by the Earl of Bothwell, and the Congregation thrown into extreme distress.2 The action was the more treacherous, as Bothwell, afterwards so notorious for his crimes, was at this moment in secret correspondence with the re- 1 Knox, p. 200.

To this succeeded another calamity: Haliburton, pro vost of Dundee, and reputed one of the best military leaders in the country, commanded a party of his townsmen at the seige of Leith, and had planted some great ordnance on an eminence near Holyrood. During the absence of many of the leaders of the Congrega tion who had gone to the sermon, which lasted till noon, the French attacked the battery, and defeating his party with great loss, pursued them into the streets of the city, where they had the cruelty to slay not only several aged persons who could make no re sistance, but to murder a woman in cold blood, with an infant at her breast.1 On their return to Leith the Queen Regent sitting on the ramparts welcomed her victorious soldiers, and smiled to see them loaded with the homely and multifarious plunder of the houses of her poor citizens. We cannot wonder that the popularity of this Princess was on the wane, yet her affairs continued to prosper, and her enemies divided in opinion and despairing of support, became weakened by desertion and spiritless in their exer tion. On the 5th November the French sallied from Leith, with the purpose of intercepting a convoy carrying provisions into Edinburgh. Arran and the Lord James attacked them at the head of a small company, but pushing into difficult ground, they got entangled between the morass of Restalrig and the moat surrounding the park, and falling into confusion, 1 MS. Calderwood, vol. i. p, 394."], [205, "1559 173 MARY were defeated with great loss. Haliburton, to whose exertions it was owing that they were not entirely cut to pieces, fell in this action ; and although the Lord James and Arran escaped, its consequences were so fatal, that the Congregation abandoned the town at midnight, and retired precipitately, first to Linlithgow and afterwards to Stirling (6th Nov. 1559). The capital had generally been esteemed peculiarly favour able to the reformers, but the late disasters cooled the ardour of many of their proselytes, and they re treated amidst the shouts and insults of a great pro portion of the citizens.1 At this season of trial and distress, the courage and eloquence of Knox wonderfully supported his party. Whilst yet in Edinburgh he had commenced a sermon, (on the 80th Psalm) in which he demonstrated that the felicity of God's people was not to be measured by external appearances, since in the course of their history it had often happened, that his chosen flock suffered more severely than the ignorant and idola trous heathen ; at Stirling, he continued the subject, warned the congregation of their sin in trusting too much to an arm of flesh \u2014 reminded them of their humility and holiness, when at the commencement of this great struggle they had only God for their pro tector, and bade them beware, lest they had more re spect to the power and dignity of their leader, the Duke, than to the favour of heaven, and the equity of 1 MS.

Passing from this to a personal exhorta- tion, he reproached Chastelherault with his slowness to join the reformers, and pointed out the sin he had committed in giving assistance to their enemies. \" I am uncertain '' said he, \" if my Lord's grace hath un- feignedly repented of his assistance given to the mur- derers who unjustly pursued us, I am uncertain if he hath repented of the innocent blood of Christ's martyrs, which was shed through his default. But let it be that so he hath done, (as I hear he hath confessed his offence before the Lords and brethren of the Con- gregation) yet, sure I am that neither he nor his friends did feel before this time the anguish and grief of heart which we felt when their blind fury pursued us \u2014 and, therefore, hath God justly permitted both them and us to fall in this confusion \u2014 us, because we pnt our confidence in man \u2014 and them, to make them feel how bitter was that cup which they had made others to drink before them ; what then remaineth, said he, tut that both they and we turn to the Eternal \u2014 our God who beateth down to death, that he may raise up again, to leave behind the remembrance of his won- drous deliverance to the praise of his own name, which, if we do unfeignedly, I no more doubt, that this our dolour, confusion, and fear, shall be turned into joy, honour, and boldness, than I doubt that God gave victory to the Israelites over the Benjamites, after they were twice with ignominy repulsed and driven back.

It is the eternal truth of God, and, however for the time oppressed, must in the end be triumphant.1 Animated by this address, the leaders met in Council, and after prayer by Knox it was resolved instantly to despatch Maitland, of Lethington, to solicit assistance from Elizabeth ; at the same time, being unable to keep the field, they determined, till an answer arrived from England to separate into two parties. The Duke, with the Earl of Glencairn, and the Lords Boyd and Ochiltree, remained at Glas gow with their friends, for the comfort and defence of the brethren \u2014 Arran, the Lord James, the Earl of Roth es, the Master of Lindsay, and their adherents, continued in Fife,2 and it was resolved, that on the 16th December a Convention should be held at Stir ling, with the view of deciding upon more active operations. On the retreat of the Protestants from the capital, the town was immediately occupied by the Queen Regent, but all her attempts to procure possession of the castle were unavailing. Its Governor, Lord Erskine, declared, that as it had been committed to his charge by the Parliament of Scotland,3 nothing but an order of the same great Council, would induce him to surrender it, and although alternately flattered 1 Knox's History, p. 210. 2 MS.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. and threatened by both parties, he appears honestly to have kept his resolution. Yet, it was evident that the Regent had gained important ground \u2014 her suc cesses imparted confidence to her soldiers, and the news having been carried to France, great prepara tions were made to send such a force into Scotland, as should at once crush the Congregation and put an end to the war. But Elizabeth became at length convinced that such a result would weaken the power and endanger the tranquillity of England, nor could the reformers have selected a more able envoy than Maitland of Lethington to confirm her in this idea.1 He repre sented to her, in strong terms, the impossibility of their being able to cope with the veteran troops of France, unless she supported them by an open demonstration in their favour, and sent a naval and military force to their assistance. The great diffi culty lay in the circumstance that both countries were at peace, and that any active co-operation with the reformed faction would justly be considered as an open declaration of war. Some time before this (25th October, 1559) Knox had suggested to Sir James Crofts, the Governor of Berwick, a crafty political expedient by which a thousand or more men might, without breach of league with France, be sent to their assistance in Scotland.2 It was free, he said, for English subjects to serve any nation or prince in war who paid their wages ; and if this was questioned, 1 Sadler, vol. i. p. 565. 2 Caligula, B. x. f. 43, dorso.

It was resolved to enter into a solemn agreement with the leaders of the Congregation, the terms of which were to be dis cussed in a secret meeting of commissioners from both countries, to be held at Berwick. Preparations, at the same time, were made for the equipment of a fleet, which was to cruise in the Firth ; and orders were given to assemble an army, which might co operate with the reduced forces of the Protestants. This grateful intelligence was brought to the re formers on the 15th of December, by Robert Melvil, who, along with Randolph, had accompanied Lething ton to the English Court, and enjoyed the confidence of Elizabeth.3 It is curious to observe the extraordinary circum spection and care used by the English Queen in the steps which she now took. She transmitted to the reformers exact directions regarding the manner in which they were to apply to her for relief. The 1 Keith, appendix, pp. 39, 40, 41 . 2 Sadler, vol. i. pp. 523, 524.

The single ground upon which they entreated succour from England, was the tyranny of France, the evident intention of that king dom to make a conquest of Scotland, and ultimately to dispossess Elizabeth of the throne.1 \" Most true it is,\" say they, \"that this practice of the French is not attempted only against this kingdom of Scotland, but also against the Crown and kingdom of England and Ireland, for we know most certainly that the French have devised to spread abroad, though most falsely, that our Queen is right heir to England and Ireland, and to notify the same to the world, have in paintings at public jousts in France and other places, this year caused the arms of England, contrary to all right, to be borne quarterly with the arms of Scotland, mean ing nothing less than any augmentation to Scotland, but to annex them both perpetually to the Crown of France.' 2 We have here a strong presumption that Elizabeth was inimical to what she esteemed the ultra-Protestant reformation established in Scotland, nor can it be denied that this transaction presents us with a somewhat mortifying view of the early reformers in this country, when we find, that after all the solemn 1 Sadler, vol. i. p. 569. 2 This sentence is in great part a transcript of the instructions drawn up by Elizabeth.

During the interval occupied by the mission of Lethington to England, neither party was idle. The Queen Dowager eagerly availed herself of the ad vantages she had gained. She despatched Monsieur de Rubay to remonstrate with Elizabeth against the support which she had given to her rebellious sub jects j1 she occupied the capital, and afterwards carried the war into Fife, where she exerted herself to disperse and defeat the little band there commanded by Arran and the Lord James. These leaders, however, who had gained in military experience, were able to keep the French in check ; and a seasonable supply of money, which they received early in December, com municated fresh spirits to their party, and encouraged them to levy an additional force of one thousand foot and two hundred horse.2 At Glasgow, the Duke 1 MS.

Soon after this (30th November, 1559), a proclamation was made at Glasgow. It ran in the name of Francis and Mary, King and Queen of Scots, and informed those misguided subjects who still respected the authority of the Queen Dowager, that her whole power had been devolved upon the Lords of the Privy Council, who were reformed. Their chief aim, they declared, was to advance the glory of God, and to remove idolatry ; for which end they commanded all such clergymen as had not yet made open confession of their faith, to appear before the Council at St. Andrew's, and there give full proof of their conver sion by a public renunciation of all manner of super stition,under the penalty of losing their benefices and being reputed enemies to God.1 Nor was this all. In the beginning of the following month, the Council of the Congregation at Dundee, in the name of the King and Queen, directed their denunciations against the Consistory, which they denominated the Court of Antichrist, whose cursings and threatenings, they affirmed, had greatly oppressed and deluded the people. They commanded that no such assembly 1 Keith, p. 111."], [213, "1559. 181 MARY. should afterwards be held, and interdicted such wicked persons as had dared to disobey this injunc tion, from any repetition of their offence under pain of death.1 It is certain, therefore, that the Congre gation, although Elizabeth did not permit them to name the subject of religion, had in no respect departed from their resolution to destroy the Romish creed, and to plant a purer form of doctrine and worship upon its ruins. The eyes of both parties were now anxiously turned to the sea. The French were aware that the Marquess D'Elbeuf had sailed from Calais with a pow erful fleet,2 the Protestants knew that Winter, the English admiral, was embarked for Scotland, with a squadron of fourteen ships of war; uncertain, however, of the time they might be detained, it was not judged prudent to risk a defeat,3 and D'Osell, the French commander, encouraged by some trifling successes, concentrated his force at Dysart, and began his march along the coast, with the design of attacking St. Andrew's. At this moment some large vessels were descried bearing up the Firth, and the French sol diers believing them to be their friends, expressed the utmost exultation. In a short time, however, these hopes were turned into dismay. The stranger ships hoisting the English colours, proved to be 1 Keith, p. 112 (14th December, 1559). 2 The exact time of the Marquess sailing for Scotland is uncer tain. On the 30th Dec.

Their arrival intimidated D'Osell ; but making a forced and circuitous march by Stirling, in which his troops were dreadfully harassed, not only by the snow drifting in their faces, but by the attacks of the Lord James and his cavalry,1 he at last with difficulty, regained his fortifications of Leith. Mean while the Regent having sent on board the Admiral to demand the cause of this visit in a time of peace, was answered, \" that his intentions were pacific, and having gone to sea in search of pirates, he had entered the Firth to watch for them there.\"2 A re monstrance which she directed to be made to Eliza beth by the French ambassador, De Sevre, was met by a reply equally evasive. The Queen solemnly assured him she respected the treaties, and thought of nothing less than war, but she added that she saw with uneasiness the increase of the French force in Scotland, and deemed it prudent to strengthen her border garrisons, and observe the progress of their arms. De Sevre then replied, \" that what chiefly gave discontentment to his Court was, the aid which the Queen of England had given to the Scottish rebels ;\" to which she answered, \" that she could not consider the nobility and nation of Scotland as rebels ; she deemed them, on the contrary, wise and faithful subjects to the Crown of Scotland, since they had 1 Sadler, vol. i. p. 699.

In the end of Jan uary, (1559-60) the Duke of Norfolk arrived at Berwick, and being afterwards met by Maitland, Bal nevis, Pitarrow, and Lord Ruthven, who were sent by the Congregation as Commissioners, a treaty was concluded, by which the English Queen took under her protection the kingdom of Scotland, with the Duke of Chastelherault and his party.

It consisted of two thousand horse and six thousand foot, and was joined at Pres ton by the army of the Congregation,2 led by the Duke, the Earls of Argile, Glencairn, and Menteith, the Lord James, and other principal officers amongst the reformers, and estimated at nearly eight thou sand men. 1 Keith, pp. 117, 118, 119.

But this advantage, which produced in the combined armies an over confidence and contempt of discipline, was followed by a more serious action, in which Martiques attacked the English trenches, entered the camp, spiked their cannon, and put two hundred and forty men to the sword, after which he retreated with little loss to Leith.

Huntly asserted, and probably with some foundation, that as soon as he joined the Congregation, he would be attacked as a common enemy by the members of this league ; and he was answered by the reformed Lords, that as their agreement bound them to mutual defence, as soon as he joined the party, he would participate in this obligation, and enjoy its benefits.2 On the 25th of April Huntly entered the camp, accompanied by sixty horse, and soon after arrived the Bishop of Valence, a Commissioner from the 1 MS.

As Elizabeth had requested he should be heard, the reformers, although indisposed to the negotiation, could not refuse to give him audience ; but they insisted that the only basis upon which they could consent to treat should be, the demolition of the fortifications of Leith, and the expul sion of the French from Scotland. These terms were rejected by the Prelate, who upon his part demanded an express renunciation of the league with England : this, it was said, could not be done without the consent of Elizabeth, but they offered to produce the contract to the estates of Parliament, and if they found the league prejudicial to the liberty of Scotland, or against their allegiance as true subjects, to use every means to have it dissolved.1 Under such circumstances, the conference having broken off, a second covenant was drawn up by the Congregation, (27th April) in which they obliged themselves, not only to support the reformation of religion, the freedom of preaching, and the due administration of the sacraments, accord ing to the word of God, but to resist the tyranny of the French, and to unite for the expulsion of stran gers, and the recovery of their ancient liberty.2 After many delays, Huntly at last consented to sign this agreement, and a reinforcement having 1 MS.

Early in May a general assault was made, but treachery had entered the English camp : Sir James Crofts, to whom the attack upon the quarter towards the sea had been committed, failed to bring forward his divi sion in time ; the scaling ladders on being applied to the wall were found too short, and the English, after their utmost efforts, were driven back with severe loss.1 The Queen Regent availing herself of this success, expressed her deep commiseration for the afflicted state of the country, and requested an interview with the Earls of Huntly and Glencairn, with whom she was ready to enter into a negotiation. Instead how ever of these two noblemen, the Lord James, with Lethington, Lord Ruthven and the Master of Max well waited upon her ; they offered to dismiss their troops, to return to their allegiance, and acknowledge her authority, under the single condition that the French soldiers should depart the realm, and if these terms were accepted, they were ready, they said, to refer all other subjects in dispute to the decision of a Parliament. There seems every reason to believe that the Regent, if permitted to follow her own opinion, would have closed with these proposals, but her hands were tied by her French advisers : she requested time to consult La Brosse, D'Osell, and the \u00bb Keith, p. 126.

She then, with a countenance full of sweetness, though pallid and emaciated, embraced and kissed the nobles one by one, extending her hand lo those of inferior rank who stood by, as a token of dying charity. It was impossible that so much love, so gently and unaffectedly expressed, should fail to move those to whom it was addressed.

Possessed, accord ing to the testimony of writers whose opposite prin ciples render their evidence unsuspected, of a sound and clear intellect, a kind heart, and a generous and forgiving temper, she had gained the affections of the people, and the confidence of the nobility, by the wisdom, liberality, and prudence with which she con ducted the affairs of the country during the first years of her Regency.

Nor were the Lords of the Congregation prepared to prolong the struggle ; experience had shown them, that even with the assistance of England, France was a more formidable enemy, than they had imagined. The fortifications of Leith were so strong, that Lethington acknowledged in one of his letters, it might defy, if well victualled, an army of twenty thou sand men.1 It was impossible for them to keep the great body of their forces composed of the feudal militia for any long time under arms, and without money, which was exceedingly scarce amongst them, their hired soldiers were ready to mutiny and sell them selves to the enemy. They were as willing therefore to negociate, as the other belligerents, and under these circumstances , after some time spent in correspon dence and preliminary arrangements, Cecil, the able minister of Elizabeth, and Sir Nicholas Wotton, re paired to Edinburgh, in the middle of June. Here they met the French Commissioners, the Bishops of Valence, and Amiens, La Brosse, D'Osell, and the Sieur de Randan, who being the bearer of a letter from his master, the French King, to Elizabeth, had 1 MS.

They had taken up arms against their natural Sovereign for the expulsion of strangers from their country, and to restore the king dom to its ancient liberty ; with this end in view they had entered into a separate treaty with Elizabeth ; who had afforded them assistance both in money and by the presence of an army. It was necessary there fore to protect them from the probable vengeance of their own Sovereign, and this could only be done by including in the agreement between England and France, a recognition of the treaty between Eliza beth and the reformed Lords. The complaint that the arms and title of the Monarchs of England had been unjustly assumed by the King and Queen of France, was easily adjusted. The French Commis sioners, with little difficulty, agreed to renounce it, and even to consider the claim of compensation made by Elizabeth for the injury which she had sustained. But serious debates arose upon the second point. The negotiations here included that large portion of the nobles and commons of Scotland, which had embraced the Reformation. They had taken arms in the beginning of the war to protect themselves 1 Forbes, vol. i. p. 432. St. P. Off, MS.

As it proceeded they had boldly announced their determination to overthrow the established religion, they had carried this resolution into effect by an attack upon the religious houses, whose revenues had been seized, their lands placed in the hands of agents or factors, and the ecclesiastical proprietors reduced to poverty. Nor was this all ; this same party had suspended the Queen Regent from the exer cise of her authority, and had assumed the supreme power, not only without any commission from their Sovereign, but contrary to her express injunctions. It was not without reason, therefore, that they were regarded in France as guilty of rebellion, and with justice it was pleaded by the French Commissioners, that the treaty of Berwick, between the Queen of England and the Lords of the Congregation could never be recognised as binding by their Sovereign, without compromising her dignity in the most serious manner. But if the French Lords were thus anxious to dissolve this obnoxious league, Cecil, who saw its advantages, was as resolute that it should be maintained. He declared it to be the fixed intention of his mistress that the treaty of Berwick should be not only recognised, but confirmed. The Commis sioners of Mary and Francis remonstrated. \"They had received no authority,\" they said \" on this point ; it was even part of their instructions, that any allusion to it, should be carefully avoided.\" The superior diplomatic craft of Cecil was successfully"], [229, "1560. MARY. 197 exerted to meet the difficulty. He affected to be in dignant and inflexible, \" all conference,\" he said \" must be broken off. The Duke of Norfolk should receive orders to advance with his army into Scot land, and the matter must once more be committed to the arbitrement of the sword.\" Nay, so vigo rously did he exert himself, that on some question raised by the French regarding Elizabeth's right to the kingdoms of England and Ireland, the Minister threw his defiance in the teeth of the French Com missioners, and offered in that quarrel to spend his blood upon any of them that would deny it.' How this bravado was received does not appear, but in the end the dexterity of Cecil was triumphant. By his directions, an article was framed which flattered the vanity of the French, and preserved the dignity of their Sovereign, whilst it secured the real inter ests of the Congregation, without including any formal declaration that the concessions made to them by France proceeded from the alliance they had made with England. The sentence of the letter in which the Minister communicates this result to his Royal Mistress, is characteristic. \" To make a cover for all this, those Ambassadors were forced by us to take a few good words in a preface to the same article, and we, content with the kernel, yielded to them the shell to play withal.\"2 1 MS.

The treaty now concluded was in every way ad vantageous to the English Queen. The claims of France, and the pretensions of this power, had been a source of great annoyance to her from the com mencement of her reign. They were now finally re nounced ; it was agreed that the French army should leave Scotland ; all anxiety regarding an attack upon her kingdom, through this country was removed, and her influence over the Lords of the Congregation was confirmed by the gratitude they felt for the assistance she had given them, as well as by the anxiety she had manifested in the negotiations to protect their interests and interpose her power be tween them and their offended Sovereign. In a letter to his mistress, Cecil justly observes, \" that the treaty would be no small augmentation to her honour in this beginning of her reign, that it would finally procure that conquest of Scotland which none of her progenitors with all their battles ever obtain ed, namely, the whole hearts and goodwills of the nobility and people, which surely was better for England than the revenue of the Crown.\"1 That portion of the treaty which embraced the affairs of the Congregation is particularly worthy of notice, as it led to the full establishment of the Re formation, and is intimately connected with the sub sequent course of events.

The Duke of Chastel herault, and other Scottish nobles or barons, who possessed lands in France, were to be restored to their possessions ; redress was to be given by Parlia ment to the bishops, and other churchmen who had received injury, and no man was to molest them in the collection of their revenues. For the better government of the realm, a council of twelve was to be constituted, of which the Queen was to appoint seven., and the estates five. It was to be their duty to take cognizance of every thing during the absence of their Sovereign, the Queen of France. No fewer than six were to assemble on any occasion, and the whole, or at least a majority were to meet upon all matters of moment. Peace and war were never to be declared without the concurrence of the Estates. It was anxiously provided, that in all time coming the Realm should be governed by its native subjects ; no foreign troops were to be brought within the kingdom ; no strangers to administer justice; none but Scotsmen to be placed in the high offices of Chancellor, Treasurer, or Comptroller, and all Ecclesiastics, although Scotsmen, were ex cluded from these two last dignities. The nobility"], [232, "200 1560.

The French Cabinet had instructed their commissioners to beware of alluding, in the most distant manner, to the treaty of Berwick, which had been entered into between the reformers and England ; and if they could not procure the consent of the Queen to the dissolution of this league, to be on their guard, at least, that no clause should be 1 Spottiswood, p. 147.

Baffled, however, in their diplomacy by the superior tactics of Cecil (whose cold, equable temper seems to have been seized with a fit of unusual exultation in alluding to the result), Randan and Monluc, contrary to their instructions, agreed to the insertion of a sentence which virtually protected the reformers, and preserved their treaty with Elizabeth. Nay, so wary had been the conduct of Wotton and Cecil, that, to use their own words, \" even if the said treaty shall not remain in force, the special points tending to keep Frenchmen out of Scotland be well and assuredly provided for.''1 The reformed Lords were not tardy to acknowledge the great obligations conferred upon them by the issue to which Elizabeth had brought the negotiations. They addressed a letter to the Queen, containing the warmest expres sions of gratitude, and acknowledged, that in pro viding for the security and liberty of Scotland, the realm was more bounden to her Majesty than to their own Sovereign.2 Nor was this excess of gratitude at all unnatural. By the various provisions above detailed, it is evident that the Protestants had amply secured their own interests. One only objection existed to this part of the treaty, but it was a fatal one. The Commissioners of Mary 1 Haynes, vol. i. p. 352. 2 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, 17th July, 1560. Haynes, vol. i. pp. 349, 351."], [234, "1560. 202 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. and Francis, had no authority from their Sove reign to enter into any negotiation with the Congregation, and the Queen of Scotland refused to be bound by an agreement to which she was no party. It is remarkable that the treaty included no express provision on the subject of the reformed religion, whilst the bishops and ministers of the ancient faith were treated with uncommon lenity ; their property restored, their persons protected, their right of sit ting in Parliament acknowledged. The cause of all this is not difficult to discover. The assistance given by Elizabeth had no reference to religion. She had agreed to support the Protestants with her army, on the sole ground that they had taken arms to pre serve the liberty of their country, and to expel the French, who, through Scotland, threatened her own dominions, and questioned her title to the throne. Individually, the Queen was not disposed to favor the religious views of the Congregation, whose ultra- Protestantism she regarded with aversion. Cecil, therefore, was instructed not to meddle with the subject, and the point was left open to be afterwards settled between the Reformers and their own Sovereign. Yet, in gaining the power to assemble a parliament, for which their Queen was to send over a Commis sion, and whose proceedings were to be esteemed as valid if called by her own writ, they obtained their utmost wishes. The great body of the people, the cities, burghs, and middle classes, were, they knew,"], [235, "1560 MARY 203 favorable to the Reformation ; and they reckoned with confidence on a majority amongst the nobles, many of whom had already tasted the sweets of ecclesiasti cal plunder, and were little disposed to give up what they had won. For these reasons, although certain articles concerning religion were presented to the Commissioners on the part of the nobles and people of Scotland, their refusal to enter into discussion upon them does not appear to have occasioned either fear or disappointment. They looked to the Con vention of Estates, which was so soon to meet, and felt confident that all would be there settled to their satisfaction.1 The treaty having been concluded and signed by the Commissioners, peace was proclaimed at Edin burgh (8th of July, 1560). Soon after the French army, consisting of four thousand men, were embarked in English ships for France ; the English forces at the same time began their march homeward, and on reach ing Dunbar, demolished the fortifications, according to the agreement. A solemn public thanksgiving was held by the reformed nobles and the greatest part of the Congregation in St. Giles's church , where the preacher, who was probably Knox, in a prayer preserved in his history, described the miseries of their country, lately groaning under the oppression of a foreign yoke and an abominable idolatrous worship. He acknowledged the mercy of God in sending, through the instrumentality of England, a deliverance which 1 Keith, p. 142, Art. 17."], [236, "204 1560. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. their own policy or strength could never have accom plished, called upon them all to maintain that godly league entered into with Elizabeth, and implored God to confound the counsels of those who endeavoured to dissolve it.1 Ministers were then appointed to some of the chief towns in the kingdom, Knox being directed to continue his charge at Edinburgh, whilst Goodman was sent to St. Andrew's, Heriot to Aber been, Row to Perth, and others to Jedburgh, Dundee, Dumfermling, and Leith. Superintendents were next chosen for the districts of Lothian, Glasgow, Fife, Angus, and Mearns, and lastly for Argile and the Isles.2 On the 10th of July the Parliament assembled, to adjourn, as had been determined, to the 1st of August, on which day the proceedings were opened with great solemnity. So grave and important a meeting of this great Council of the nation had not taken place for many years, and the attendance of all ranks was, we know from Lethington, more numerous than had ever been seen in his time.3 One cause of this crowded attend ance was a proceeding adopted by the lesser Barons. Many of these persons, notwithstanding their right to sit and vote in the Assembly of the Three Estates, had ceased to claim their privilege. Indifference to public affairs, occupation upon their own demesnes 1 Knox, pp. 251, 252. MS. Calderwood, p. 428, vol. i. 2 Keith, p. 145. 3 Original Letter, St. P. Off., Lethington to Cecil, 15th August, 1560."], [237, "1560. 205 MARY. and the expense attendant on a journey to the capital, had occasioned their absence. But it was amongst these persons that the reformed doctrines had made the greatest progress, and aware that the subjects to be debated must involve the great religious principles in dispute between the Congregation and the Romanists, they attended in their places, and presented a petition, in which they prayed to be restored to their privilege, and to be allowed to give their counsel and vote in the Parliament. After some trifling opposition, they were permitted to take their seats, although a final decision on their claims does not appear to have been given. The accession, however, of so many votes (their number being a hundred), was of no small consequence to the Pro testants, who were anxious that they should imme diately proceed to the business of the Parliament. On this, however, there arose a serious difference of opinion. It was pleaded by many, that no Parliament could be held till the Commission arrived from their Sovereign, or at least till some reply was received to the message which had been sent to France, informing her of their proceedings.1 Others alleged, that by one of the articles of the peace, it had been deter- 1 It does not appear who were despatched on this mission to inform their sovereign. As late as the 9th of August 1 560, the French King expressed to Throckmorton, the English ambassador, his surprise that he had heard nothing from his Commissioners, and affirmed that he had not yet seen the treaty of Edinburgh. The Bishop of Glasgow and the Lord Seton had arrived at Paris on the 3rd of August.\u2014 MS. Letter, St. P. Off. French Corr. Sir N.

Many, on learning the result, departed from the capital, and of the Spiritual Estate very few attended. These preliminary questions having been settled, the crown, the mace and the sword were laid upon the seat or throne, usually occupied by the Queen ;2 and Maitland, who possessed great influence with the Congregation, being chosen Speaker (it was then termed \" harangue maker,'') opened the pro ceedings in an oration of which Randolph has given us the principal heads. He excused his insufficiency to occupy that place, made a brief discourse of things past, showed what necessity men were forced into for defence of their country ; what remedy and sup port it had pleased God to send them, and how much they were bound heartily to acknowledge and requite it. He took away the persuasion which had then entered into many men's minds, that other things were intended than those which had been attempted; he advised all estates to renounce their individual feelings, and to bend themselves wholly to the true 1 Spottiswood, p.. 149. 2 Keith, p. 149, erroneously states that the Royal Ensigns of the Kingdom were omitted to be carried into the Parliament."], [239, "1560. MARY. 207 service of God and their country, describing the miserable condition to which it had been long re duced for lack of good government and exercise of justice. He exhorted them to mutual amity and hearty friendship \u2014 one to live with another as mem bers all of one body ; using the example of the fable, \" when the mouth, having quarrelled with the members, refused to receive sustenance for so long a time that the whole body perished.\" In conclu sion, he prayed God long to maintain amity and peace with all princes, and especially betwixt the realms of England and Scotland, in the love and fear of God.1 The Clerk of the Register now rose, and having inquired of the Three Estates, to what matter they would proceed ; it was judged proper that the articles of the peace should be read over, which having* been done, they received the unani mous approbation of the Assembly, and were directed to be sent over to France to receive the ratification of their Sovereign. The Lords of the Articles were next chosen, the order of which, says Randolph, \" is, that the Lords Spiritual choose the Temporal, and the Tem poral the Spiritual \u2014 the Burgesses their own.\"1 Great complaint was here made by the Prelates, that in the selection of the Lords Spiritual, none were chosen but such as were known to be well affected to the new religion, nor was it unnoticed that some upon 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off. Randolph to Cecil, 9th and 10th Aug. 1560."], [240, "1560. 208 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. whom the choice had fallen, were mere laymen. So great was the majority, however, of the friends of the Congregation, that it was impossible to have re dress. \" This being done,\" says Randolph, in an interesting letter to Cecil, where he describes the proceedings of the parliament, \" the Lords departed, and accompanied the Duke as far as the Bow, which is the gate going out of the high street, and many down unto the palace where he lieth ; the town all in armour, the trumpets sounding, and all other kinds of music, such as they have. Other solem nities have not been used, saving in times long past the Lords have had parliament robes, which are now with them wholly out of use; the Lords of the Arti cles sat from henceforth in Holyrood-house, except that at such times as upon any matter of importance, the whole Lords assembled themselves again as they did this day in the Parliament House.\"1 Having proceeded thus far, a petition was pre sented to the Parliament by some of the most zealous of the reformers. It prayed, that the doctrines pro fessed by the Romish Church, and tyrannically main tained by the clergy, should be condemned and abolished, and amongst the errors it particularly enumerated ; transubstantiation, adoration of Christ's body under the form of bread, the merit of works, purgatory, pilgrimages, and prayers to departed saints. 1 MS.

It stated, that the sacraments of our Lord were shame fully abused by that Roman harlot by whom the true discipline of the Church was extinguished ; and proceeded to give an appalling picture, in strong and somewhat coarse language, of thecorrupt lives of those who called themselves the clergy. Embracing the whole Papal Church in one sweeping anathema, the petitioners offered to prove, that \" in all the rabble of the Clergy,\" there was not one lawful mi nister, if the word of God, and the practices of the Apostles and primitive Church, were to be taken as \u25a0authority upon this point ; it denominated them, thieves and murderers, rebels, traitors, and adul terers; living in all manner of abominations, and unworthy to be suffered in any reformed common wealth. Lastly, using that blessed name, which ought to be the bond of love and charity, as an in citement to railing and persecution, it called upon the Parliament, in the bowels of Jesus Christ, to em ploy the victory which they had obtained, with wholesome vigour ; to compel the body of the Ro mish clergy to answer these accusations now brought against them, to pronounce them unworthy of autho rity in the Church of God, and expel them for ever from having a voice or vote in the great Council of VOL.

In conclusion, it virtually declared that this extraordinary petition was not their's but God's, who craved this by his ser vants, and it prayed Him to give them an upright heart and a right understanding of the requests made through them.1 The names of those who signed this violent production, which it is difficult to read without emotions of sorrow and pity, do not appear. Knox, whose fiery zeal flamed high at this period, seized the sitting of the Parliament as a proper season for a course of sermons on the prophecies of Llaggai, in which he tells us, he was pecu liarly \"special and vehement,\" the doctrine being proper to the times. - Many of the nobles, how ever, who had prospered upon the plunder of the Church, demurred to the sentiments of the preacher, when he exhorted them to restore their lands for the support of the ministers ; and Leth ington, exclaimed in mockery, \" We must now forget ourselves, and bear the barrow to build the house of God.'3 Yet, although some were thus 1 MS.

There can be no doubt that it received the sanction, if it was not the composition of the Reformer. On being read in Parliament, this petition occa sioned a great diversity of sentiment : to the sincere Romanist it appeared an impious denouncement of all that he esteemed sacred, and even the more moderate of those who had embraced the tenets of the Reformation might well doubt whether it was not calculated to inflame rather than to heal the wounds it proposed to cure ; still there can be little doubt, that as the great majority in the parliament supported the changes proposed, it would have been favour ably received, but for one circumstance which touched some of the highest and most influential of the Protestant leaders. It called upon them to re store the patrimony of the Church, of which they had unjustly possessed themselves, to the uses for which it was originally destined ; the support of the minis ters, the restoration of godly learning, and the assist ance of the poor. This, according to Knox, was unpalateable doctrine to the nobles, who for worldly respects abhorred a perfect reformation.1 Waving therefore the practical part of the question, and retaining for the present the wealth they had won, the majority of the parliament commanded the ministers to draw up a Confession of their faith, or a 1 Knox, p. 252. v 2"], [244, "1560. 212 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. brief summary of those doctrines which they con ceived wholesome, true, and necessary to be be lieved,1 and received within the realm. This solemn and arduous task was achieved apparently with ex traordinary rapidity ; but although only four days *.\u00bb ere employed in its preparation, it is evident that the Confession of Faith embodied the results of much previous study and consultation. It is a clear and admirable summary of christian doctrine, grounded on the word of God. On most essential points, it approximates indefinitely near, and in many instances, uses the very words of the Apostles Creed and the Articles of the Church of England, as es tablished by Edward the Sixth. Thus, in the section on Baptism, the Scottish Confession of Faith declares, \" We assuredly believe, that by baptism we are in grafted into Jesus Christ, to be made partakers of his justice, by the which our sins are covered and remitted-\" Compare this with the article of Edward the Sixth and of Elizabeth \" of Baptism.\" It is there said to be a sign, not only of profession, but of re generation, whereby, as by an instrument, they that re ceive baptism rightly, \" are grafted into the Church.\" Again, of the Lord's Supper, the Scottish Confession of Faith declares, \" We most assuredly believe, that the bread that we break is the Communion of Christ's Body, and the cup which we bless is the Communion of his Blood, so that we do confess and believe that the faithful, in the right use of the Lord's 1 Spottiswood, p. 150."], [245, "1560 213 MARY table, so do eat the body, and drink the blood of the Lord Jesus, that he remaineth in them and they in him.\" In the articles of Edward the Sixth, the same precise words are used. Indeed it is worthy of remark, that in these holy mysteries of our faith, this Confession, drawn up by the primitive Scottish reformers, keeps in some points at a greater distance from the rationalizing of ultra Protestantism than the Articles of Edward. But to return, before the au thors of the Confession agreed finally on every point it should embrace, the treatise was submitted to the revisal of the Secretary Lethington, and the Sub- Prior of St. Andrew's, who mitigated the austerity of many words and sentences, and expunged a chap ter on the limits of the obedience due by subjects to their magistrates, which they considered improper to be then discussed. So at least, says Randolph, but it is certain that a chapter \" Of the Civil Magistrate,\" forms a portion of the Confession of Faith as it is printed by Knox,1 and that it not only prescribes in clear and strong terms, the obedience due by sub jects to princes, governors, and magistrates, as powers ordained by God, but pronounces all who attempt to abolish the \" Holy Slate of Civil Policies,\" as ene mies alike to God and man. When thus finished, this important paper was laid before Parliament; but all disputation upon its doctrines appears to have been waved by a mutual un derstanding, that on the one side it was unnecessary, \u00bb Knox's Hist. p. 270. MS. Letter, St. P. Off, 7th Sept. 1560, Randolph to Cecil."], [246, "214 15G0. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. and on the other it would be unavailing. The Ro- manists knew that against them was arrayed a violent and overwhelming majority ; so keen were the feel- ings of some of their leaders, that the Duke of Chas- telherault had threatened his brother, the Archbishop of St. Andrew's, with death if he dared to exert him- self against it,1 nor is it by any means improbable, that similar arguments had been used with other dignitaries. Of the Temporal Peers present, the Earls of Cassillis and Caithness alone dissented ; of the Spiritual, the Primate, with the Bishops of Dunkeld and Dumblane. Time, they said, had not been given them to examine the book : they were ready to give their consent to all things which were sanctioned by the word of God, and to abolish the abuses which had crept into the Church, but they requested some delay that the debate upon a question which branched into so many intricate, pro found, and important subjects, might be carried on with due study and deliberation.2 To these sen sible and moderate representations, no attention ap pears to have been paid, the treatise was laid upon the table, the Bishops were called upon to oppugn it upon the instant, and having declined the contest, 1 Keith, pp. 150, 487. 2 MS. Letter, St. P. Off. 18th August, 1560. Lethington to Cecil. In the letter of Randolph to Cecil, quoted below (Note 1), he says, \" of the Temporal Lords, the Earl of Cassillis, and the Earl of Caithness, said \" Nae\" ; the rest of the Lords with common consent allowed the same.\" Yet Spottiswood (p. 150) mentions Athol, Borthwick, and Somervillc, as dissentient."], [247, "1560. 215 MARY. the consent of the Parliament was given almost by acclamation ; some of the Lords, in the enthusiasm of the moment, declared they would sooner end their lives than think contrary to these doctrines ; many offered to shed their blood in the cause. The Earl Marshall, with indignant sarcasm, called upon the Bishops, as the pillars of the Papal Church, to de fend the tenets of their master, and the venerable Lord Lindsay, rising up in his place, and alluding to his extreme age, declared that since God had spared him to see that day, and the accomplishment of so worthy a work, he was ready with Simeon to say, \" nunc dimittis.\"3 This Confession having been sanctioned by parlia ment, as the standard of the Protestant faith in Scotland, it was thought proper to complete the work by passing three Acts. The first abolished for ever in that country the power and jurisdiction of the Pope; the second repealed all former statutes passed in favour of the Romish Church ; the third ordained that all who said mass, or who dared to hear mass, should, for the first trangression, be punished with confiscation of goods ; for the second, incur the penalty of banishment from the kingdom ; and if guilty of a third offence, be put to death. Few blessings have been of slower growth in Europe than religious toleration. The same men who had groaned so lately under persecution, who upbraided their Romish brethren, and with perfect justice, for the 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off. Randolph to Cecil 19th- Aug- 1560."], [248, "1560 216 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. tyranny of maintaining their errors by fire and sword, now injured the cause they advocated by similar severities, and compelled the reception of what they pronounced the truth, under the penalty of death. In these transactions, Randolph, who was now resident in Edinburgh, in the character of Elizabeth's envoy at the Scottish Court, took a prominent part. The spirit in which he carried on his intrigues will be understood from a passage in one of his letters relating to a subject about to be brought before the parliament \u2014 the signing the contract made between Elizabeth and the Congregation at Berwick. \" The Bishop of Dumblane,\" says he, \" is also now come; it is not to reason upon religion, but to do, as I hear, whatsoever the Earl of Argile will command him. If God have prepared him and his Metropolitan to die obstinate Papists, yet I would wish that before they go to the devil, they would show some token that once in their lives they loved their country, and set their hands to the contract, as hardly I believe they will.\"1 These uncharitable and intolerant feelings, however, were not cherished against the Romish prelates alone. It was the opinion of many of the leaders of the Reformation now in progress in Scotland, that the hierarchy of England, as established under Elizabeth, was nearly as corrupt as Rome itself. In a letter addressed by Goodman, originally a minister of the English Church, but now one of the 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Randolph to , Cecil I believe, but the name does not certainly appear. 15th August, 1560."], [249, "1560. MARY. 217 most active preachers of the Congregation, to Cecil, he exhorted that powerful statesman to \" abolish all the relics of superstition and idolatry which, to the grief and scandal of the godly, were still retained in Eng land, and (alluding probably to Bonner and Gardiner) not to suffer the bloody Bishops and known murderers of God's people and your dear brethren to live, upon whom God hath expressly pronounced the sentence of death, for the execution of which he nath com mitted the sword into your hands, who are now placed in authority.\" It was this delay, he declared, this leniency in Cecil (who was happily not animated by the same fiery spirit of persecution which guided the proceedings of Goodman), that sticketh most in the hearts of many.1 The \" Confession of Faith\" having been passed in Parliament, the clergy next proceeded to compose a \" Book of Discipline,\" for the future government of the Church. Into the contents of this celebrated form of church polity, it is of course impossible to enter at any length ; but it is important to remark, that it committed the election of ministers solely to the people, using the precaution that the person so chosen, before he was admitted to the holy office, should be examined by the ministers and elders openly upon all points then in controversy between the Church of Rome and the Congregation, and generally upon the whole extent of sound Christian \u00bb MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Goodman to Cecil, 26th October, 1559-"], [250, "1560. 218 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. doctrine. Such having been done, the person elected and approved of, was to be considered an ordained minister, and to be publicly introduced by his brethren to his congregation in the church to which he was ap pointed, it being expressly declared, \" that any other ceremonies than the approbation of the people, and the declaration of the chief minister, that the person presented is appointed to serve,\" are not approved of by the Congregation ; for albeit, they add, the Apostles used the imposition of hands, yet, seeing the miracle is ceased, the using the ceremony we judge not to be necessary. The same form appointed \" Readers '' to such churches as, owing to the rarity of learned and godly men, could not immediately be provided with ministers. It was their office simply to read the Common Prayers and the Scrip tures, not to administer the sacraments. Lastly, the country was divided into ten diocesses, and over them were appointed ten ministers, who were named Superintendents. These were not to be \"suffered to live idle, as the bishops had done heretofore,\" neither were they to be stationary, but to be ambulatory preachers, continuing about three or four months in one place, after which they were to enter into a visitation of their whole bounds, preaching thrice a week at the least, and not intermitting their labours until the churches were wholly planted. They were directed to inquire into the life and behaviour of the ministers, the manners of the people, the provision for the poor, and the instruction of the youth ; and under this last head may be noticed, as first appearing"], [251, "1560. MARY. 219 in this \" Book of Discipline,\" that wise and admirable institution of Parish Schools, to which Scotland has owed so much of her prosperity. \" It was necessary,5' such are nearly the words of the Congregation, \" that care should be had of the virtuous and godly educa tion of the youth, wherefore it was judged in every parish to have a proper Schoolmaster, able to teach at least the Grammar and Latin tongue, where the town was of any reputation.\" But it adds, \"in land wart (that is country parishes), where the people convened to doctrine only once in the week, there must either the reader or the minister take care of the youth of the parish, to instruct them in their rudiments, and especially in the Catechism of Geneva.\"1 This Book of Discipline was almost as bitterly opposed as the Confession had been warmly and unanimously supported. Some of the nobles and barons positively refused to subscribe it; others signed it, but eluded its injunctions ; others, who dreaded the punishment of their vices or the curtailing of their revenues, mocked at its provisions and pro nounced them devout imaginations. \" The cause,\" says Knox, \" we have before declared. Some were licentious, some had greedily griped the possessions of the Church, and others thought that they would not lack their part of Christ's coat. * * The chief great man\" he continues \"that professed Christ and refused to subscribe the Book of Discipline, was the Lord Erskine. And no wonder, for besides that he 1 Spottiswood, p. 154\u2014160 inclusive."], [252, "220 1560.

Assuredly some of us have wondered how men that profess godliness could of so long continuance hear the threatenings of God against thieves and against their houses, and knowing themselves guilty in such things as were openly rebuked, that they never had remorse of conscience, neither yet intended to restore any thing of that which long they had stolen and reft. There were none within the realm more unmerciful to the poor ministers than those which had the greatest rents of the churches.\"1 But if severe to the Protestant clergy, the par liament was still more decisive against the Romish prelates. Of these, many who considered the meet ing illegal absented themselves.

The Romish prelates, in their anxiety to preserve their estates from the grasp of the Barons of the Congrega tion, had adopted the expedient of granting convey ances, or leases of their lands, to those who agreed to pay them the rents, and to reconvey them to their original proprietors in more prosperous times. Against these alleged alienations of the estates of the Church, which had been sanctioned by the Pope, the Parliament directed its censure, ordaining thatall such leases should be void without further process of law.3 One of the last subjects which occupied the attention of the parliament, was the selection of the twenty-four members, out of which number the Council of Twelve was to be chosen. It was scarcely to be expected that the choice should be impartial. Yet, although care was taken to include all the prin cipal leaders of the Congregation, it embraced some of the opposite party. It consisted of the Duke, the Earl of Arran, the Earls of Huntly, Argile, Glencairn, Morton, Athole, Menteith, Marshall, and Rothes.

The treaty of Berwick, which had been entered into between Eli zabeth and the Lords of the Congregation was next confirmed,1 and it was proposed that, as the surest basis of a perpetual amity between the two realms, an overture for a marriage between the Earl of Arran, eldest son to the Duke of Chastelherault, heir appa rent to the throne, and Queen Elizabeth should be sent to England. It was earnestly recommended by Lethington, that until they understood in what man ner Cecil was affected towards this measure, no hasty proceedings should take place, but although much disunion existed on other subjects, a singular unani mity appears to have here pervaded the assembly ; and it was resolved, \" that suit should be made to the Queen of England, in the best manner, that it may please her Majesty, for the establishing of a per petual friendship, to join in marriage with the Earl of Arran.\"2 It was, last of all, determined that Sir James 1 The Lord James, for himself and the contractors, protested that they might have an instrument that this their act was allowed to be good, lawful, and not prejudicial to the Crown of Scotland.

Having brought these important matters to a conclusion, the Parliament was dissolved on the 27th of August.1 On his arrival at the French Court, Sir James Sandilands2 was received with the utmost coldness. Nor could the Congregation have expected it to be otherwise. He brought intelligence to the Queen of Scotland, that without waiting for her ratification of the treaty concluded by her Commissioners, or giving her time to send her Commission for the calling* a Parliament, the Three Estates had assembled of their own authority, and by a series of acts more sweeping than any that had ever passed in the preceding his tory of the country, had introduced innovations which it was impossible could be regarded without alarm \u2014 they had overturned the established religion, and let loose against all who ventured to adhere to the belief of their fathers, the fury of religious perse cution, they had entered into a league with another kingdom, and, as if conscious of the illegal nature of 1 Keith is at a loss to know how long they sat after the 24th.

The truth of these assertions could not be denied, and when the young Queen and her advisers, the Guises, contrasted the conduct of the Parliament towards Elizabeth, with the manner in which they treated their Sovereign, to whom they pretended all loyalty and affection, they could not fail to be mortified with the difference. So completely were English interests predominant in the assembly of the Estates, that Lethington and Murray in all important measures received the advice of Elizabeth and her Ministers ; and so far was this carried, that Cecil drew up and transmitted to them the scroll of the act, which was to be passed in their assembly.1 In an interview which took place soon after Sandi land's arrival, between Throckmorton, the English Ambassador, and the Cardinal Lorraine, the feelings of this proud minister upon the subject were strongly intimated : \" I will tell you frankly,\" said the Cardi nal, \" the Scots, the King's subjects, do perform no part of their duties ; the King and the Queen have the name of their Sovereigns, and your mistress hath the effect and the obedience.

Nor can we blame either her or the Guises, for their steady refusal to ratify the treaty. Her Commissioners, Monluc and Randan had received positive instructions from Mary to treat with England, but not to include her Scottish subjects, or recognise their league with Elizabeth ; yet they suf fered themselves to be overreached by the crafty diplomacy of Cecil, and not only included them, but virtually recognised their whole proceedings.

But although Mary complained of his inferior rank, as compared with Glencairn, Morton and Lethington, the Ambassadors to England, St. John was received with courtesy.

The Guises had resolved at pre sent to remain at peace, and wait till they discovered \u25a0in what manner Elizabeth received the embassy, proposing to her a marriage with Arran. If she declined the match, and treated the overtures of the Protestants with coldness, they determined to sow jealousies between the Reformers and their patroness \u2014 to persuade the Scots, that she had acted solely from a desire to aggrandize herself, and induce them to continue the old amity with France.

He took not his leave of the King, by reason of his indisposition, but of the Queen, and the Cardinal Lorraine ,- he had very good words, and was required to use the part and office of a good Minister towards the Estates of Scotland, and of a good subject towards his Sovereigns.

To traverse these schemes, the English Ambassador advised Elizabeth to employ Clark, one of the archers of the French Guard, a subtle and intriguing agent of his, who had been bred up as a spy in France ; he accordingly left that country with letters of recommendation to the Queen, and being sent into Scotland, pursued his treacherous vocation with great activity and success.2 Although the policy of the Guisian faction was for the moment watchful and pacific, their motive was merely to gain time, their main purpose continued the same as before, the destruction of the party of the Reformation in Europe. To put down the Huguenots in France, to encourage the Romanists 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, French Corr. 10th Oct. 1560, Throck morton to the Lords of the Council. 2 MS. Letter. French Corr. St. P.

Under the Regency of the Queen Dowager, the affairs of Scotland had been entrusted principally to D\"Osell, a man of talent and a good officer, but rash, and overbearing. On the return, however, of Monluc, Bishop of Valence, with Martignes to the French Court, after their negotiations, D'Osell, who it was generally supposed would have the chief voice in Scottish affairs, lost the royal favour, and found himself entirely passed over. The cause of his disgrace, as stated by Throckmorton, in a letter to Elizabeth, presents us with an appalling picture of the dark policy of the Guises. At the commencement of the religious troubles in Scotland, the Bishop of Amiens, De la Brosse, and Martignes advised the Queen Dowager to dissemble with the Congregation^ to call a Parliament at Leith or Edinburgh, and having got the chief leaders under one roof, to seize and put to death the most violent.1 The Queen Regent revolted from so base a proposal, and D'Osell compelled his less scrupulous associates to abandon it.

Theyoung French King, Francis the Second, who had for some time laboured under a languish- ing state of health, expired at Orleans on the 6th of December.3 His youthful consort, the Scottish Queen, by whom he was ardently beloved, had watched over him with devoted care and affection, and for some time appeared inconsolable ; but the energy of her character soon recovered its ascendancy, and recalled her to the duties she had to perform, and the difficulties by which she was surrounded. Throckmor- ton, an eye-witness of her behaviour, soon after the event, addressed the following letter to the Council, which contains an interesting view, not only of the character of the young Queen, but a sketch, by the hand of a master, of the position of parties, and the 1 MS.

During her hus band's life there was no great account made of her, for that being under band of marriage, and subjection of her husband, who carried the burden and care of all her matters, there was offered no great occasion to know what was in her. But since her husband's death, she hath showed, and so continueth, that she is both of great wisdom for her years, modesty, and also of great judgment, in the wise handling herself and her matters ; which increasing in her with her years, cannot but turn to her commendation, reputation, honour, aud great benefit of her and her country. And already it appeareth that some such as made no great account of her, do now, seeing her wisdom, both honour and pity her. \" Immediately upon her husband's death, she changed her lodging, withdrew herself from all com- er O o ' pany, became so solitary and exempt of all world liness, that she doth not to this day see daylight, and thus will continue out forty days. For the space of fif teen days after the death of her said husband, she admit ted no man to come unto her chamber, but the King, his brethren, the King of Navarre, the Constable, and her uncles.

The Ambassadors also were lastly admitted, as they came, who have been all with her to condole, saving I, which I have forborn to do, knowing not the Queen's Majesty's pleasure in that behalf. \" Amongst others, the Ambassador of Spain hath been with her above an hour together, which is thought to be for more than the ceremony of condoling required.

But to conclude herein, as long as the matter shall be well handled in England, and that now, in time, good occasions be not let pass, the King of Spain will have little mind that way. As for my part, I see her behaviour to be such, and her wisdom and queenly modesty so great, in that she thinketh herself not too wise, but is content to be ruled by good counsel and wise men, (which is a great virtue in a Prince or Princess, and which argueth a great judgment and wisdom in her) that by these means she cannot do amiss.

To compass which device she hath sent one Robert Lesly (who pretendeth title to the Earldom of Rothes) into Scotland, to work by such as are hers ; and besides them, doubteth nothing to procure to her a good many of those that were lately against her ; and among others, she holdeth herself sure of the Lord James, and of all the Stew ards, wholly to be at her devotion.

The Ministers not only justly considered the event as a great deliverance, but in the intolerant spirit of the times, represented it as a special judgment inflicted upon an infidel and stubborn Prince.2 Throckmorton, with greater charity, called upon his royal mistress to thank God, who by these incomprehensible means had provided for her surety and quietness.3 Lethington, with the quick prospective glance of a statesman, pronounced that the King's dea;h must have the effect of changing ma \u2022 terially the line of their policy ; * whilst the leaders of the opposite parties, which had so long separated the state, transmitted assurances of fidelity, and offers of service, to their youthful Sovereign. 1 Letter, MS.

In the meantime, all agreed that a Parliament must be summoned, and the Three Estates having assembled at Edinburgh on the 16th of January, Lord St. John, who had been overtaken on his jour ney by the news of the King's death, laid before them the letter with which he had been entrusted by their Sovereign and her late husband. It informed them that their envoy had assured her of their earnest wish to remain faithful and obedient subjects, but in the account which she had received of the proceedings of their late assembly, (so she termed the Parliament in which they had established the reformed faith) she lamented to observe, how far their conduct had deviated from their professions. Yet so anxious was she for their return to their duty, that she had resolved to despatch two noble persons as her en* voys into Scotland, bearing her commission to convene a legal Parliament, in which their requests should be fully considered, and their faults buried and forgotten.1 It was evident to the Lords of the Congregation, that the King's death, which happened three weeks after this letter was written, must have the effect of altering, in a great degree, the mutual relations between them and their Sovereign ; they saw, at the same time, that much would depend upon the policy of England; and they therefore turned with anxiety to receive the reply of Elizabeth to their late em- ' MS.

She declined the offer of marriage with the Earl of Arran, but in terms sufficiently flattering to the Estates, and to him self, acknowledging their goodwill in offering to her the choicest person whom they had, and pronouncing him a noble gentleman of gTeat worthiness : she con cluded by earnestlyrecommending unanimity amongst themselves, warning them of the practices which might still be attempted against them, and (with a glance towards France) declared her readiness to enter into a common defence against any common enemy.2 Having weighed these answers, it was determined by the Parliament that their Sovereign, who was now unfettered by any ties to France, should be invited to return to her own dominions, and that her brother, the Lord James, the chief leader of the Congrega tion, should instantly proceed as an Ambassador to that kingdom, to declare their wishes uponthis point.

He answered that he should never consent to the establishment of this idolatrous wor ship in public, but that he could not consent to the violent advice of those who would stop her from the private exercise of her own form of worship.1 Having thus received his instructions, the Parliament was prorogued till the 21st of May. At the same time that the Three Estates committed this important mission to the Lord James, a secret convention was held by the Romish faction, which was attended by the Archbishop of St. Andrew's, the Bishops of Aberdeen, Murray and Ross ; the Earls of Huntly, Athole, Crawford, Sutherland, Marshall, Caithness, and many other barons, who entrusted Lesly, then Official of Aberdeen, and afterwards Bishop of Ross, with a Commission to repair to the French Court, and present to their Sovereign their offers of service and expressions of devoted attachment. The departure of both envoys, however, was delayed by the arrival of four Commissioners from the Queen (20th February, 1560). These were Preston of Craigmillar, Ogilvy of Findlater, Lumsden of Blanern, and Lesly of Auchtermuchty. The mes- 1 MS. Calderwood, vol. i. p. 458. VOL. VI.

She assured them that she meant shortly to return home ; that all offences should be forgiven, and that the few French soldiers who still remained in garrison within Dunbar and the Inch should be sent out of the country. She informed them that offers of marriage had been already made to her on the part of the Prince of Spain and the Kings of Sweden and Denmark, but that she had resolved to entertain none of these proposals till she could in person consult her nobles and receive the assent of her people. To them she looked, and to their support, as the only sure foundation of her great ness.1 They presented at the same time a commission directed to seven leading men in Scotland, the Duke of Chastelherault, Argile, Athole, Huntly, Bothwell, the Lord James, and the Archbishop of St. Andrew's, directing them to summon a Parliament, and notify ing that the French King had resolved to despatch Monsieur de Noailles to propose to the Three Estates the renewal of the ancient league between France and Scotland, a proposal which met with her hearty concurrence. Mary, seized this moment, earnestly to recommend to her subjects of all parties the duty of mutual forbearance and forgiveness. She ad dressed letters to almost every leading man in Scotland, assuring those who had most offended against her, that she was determined to forget all in- 1 MS. Letter, St. P.

The second faction consisted of the Duke of Chastel herault and the friends of his house. He considered his only security to be a marriage, between Arran, his eldest son, and Mary. In advising* this, the sole councillor and confidant of Arran, was Knox : to promote it, Forbes, a confidential friend of the Hamiltons, had already proceeded on a secret mission to France, and although the Queen was too cautious to commit herself, the messenger was received with favour, and an answer returned which at least did not extinguish his hopes.3 The third party is described by the same acute statesman, himself an eye-witness and principal leader amongst them, as important alike in numbers, rank, and power. It was their opinion that every method should be 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Throckmorton to Elizabeth, 23rd January, 1560-1. MS. Instructions to the four Commissioners, St. P. Off, without date. 2 MS.

If she consented to this, it was his belief that ways would easily be found to induce her to favor the religion, confirm the treaty with England, and reform all abuses. Lethington concluded the letter which gives us this information, by pointing out to Cecil the dangers which must follow the renewal of the league with France, and anticipated his own certain ruin if the amity with England were dissolved. \" I pray you,\" says he, \" consider what danger it is for me to write. Many men's eyes look upon me ; my familiarity with that realm is known, and so far misliked, that I learn it shall be my undoing, unless the Queen may be made favorable to England, which I fear shall be hard to do.\"1 Nor was he singular in this opinion, the whole party of the Congregation looking to Elizabeth as their surest protection against the designs of France and the anticipated resentment of their Sovereign. On the first intelligence of the death of Francis, this Princess prepared to pursue that cautious and double policy which should preserve her interest in Scotland, at the least possible expense to herself. She despatched the Earl of Bedford to present her condolences to Mary, and to assure her of her warmest wishes for 1 MS. Letter, St. P.

He was to remind her how quiet the king dom had remained since the removal of the French troops \u2014 to declare that for the last hundred years the borders had not enjoyed so much peace as at pre sent; and if he discovered any disposition in the House of Guise to promote her marriage with Spain or Austria, he was to incite the King of Navarre, and the Protestant party in France, to oppose it, as con trary to his own greatness and the best interests of Christendom.2 Soon after this, Elizabeth instructed Randolph, then resident as her envoy at the Scottish capital, in the policy which he ought to pursue. He was directed to inform the leaders of the Protes tants of the league lately renewed amongst the princes of Germany for their mutual defence against the Pope and his adherents, and to show them how earnestly they had exhorted her to continue firm in 1 MS.

He was to express her determination to adhere to the great principles of the Reformation, to exhort the Scottish reformers to labour for the con tinuance of the peace with England, and to persuade them against the renewal of the ancient unprofitable alliance with France.1 Bedford arrived at Paris on the 3rd of February, and on the 15th of that month proceeded to the Court at Fontainbleau, where he delivered his mes- sage to the Scottish Queen.2 He was received by Mary with the courteous and winning manners for which she was so remarkable : she expressed her kindly feelings towards Elizabeth, and her desire to remain in amity with England, but steadily declined to ratify the treaty of Edinburgh, till she had returned to her kingdom and consulted the wishes of her par- liament. The interview is minutely described in an original letter of Bedford and Throckmorton, to the privy council. They were conducted to the pre- sence of the Queen of Scotland by D'Osell, her knight of honour, and on being pressed to show her desire of peace with Elizabeth, by confirming the treaty of Edinburgh, without more delay, Mary replied, \" that there were more reasons to persuade to amity, between Elizabeth, her good sister, and herself, than between any two princes in all Christendom ; we are both, (said she,) in one isle, 1 Haynes St. P., p. 366, 17th March, 1560-1. 2 St. P.

Throck- morton, then minister at the French Court, a witness to the skilfulness of Guisian diplomacy, and not insensible to the fascination of the manners of the young Queen, dreaded that he would be gained over by the bribes which were preparing for him ; or should his integrity or his self-interest resist these temptations, that some means would be found to detain him in France. \" I understand,'' says this ambassador, in a letter to Queen Elizabeth, \"that the Lord James of Scotland is appointed to come hither to the Queen of Scotland. I am very sorry for it, and so shall be still, till I see the contrary of that fall out, which I yet fear by his coming. I learn that this King, by means of the Queen of Scotland, deviseth all the means he can to win him to his devotion ; and for that purpose hath both procured the red hat for him if he will accept it, and also mindeth to endow him with good abbeys and benefices in this realm. If advancement or fair words shall win him, he shall not want the one or the other. If he so much esteem 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Lethington to Cecil.

From the corre spondence with Lethington he was aware that both Maitland and he considered their own safety as inseparably connected with the maintenance of their fidelity to Elizabeth, and having concerted their measures together, the English secretary felt little disposition to distrust the Scottish envoy, but treating him with the highest courtesy, dismissed him with earnest injunctions to attend to his personal safety.2 Having arrived at Paris, Murray found that the Queen, his Sovereign, was then at Rheims, to which place he proceeded, after having consulted with Throckmorton, and delivered to that minister the 1 MS.

It seems, however, to have produced little effect upon the mind of Maiy. She had been impressed with an unfavorable opinion of Huntly from his late wavering and crafty conduct. Although he professed an unshaken attachment to the Romish faith, and made the warmest professions of loyalty to his Sovereign, this powerful noble had scarcely a year before, joined the party of the Con gregation, upon an understanding that he should be supported in his power in the north, and share in the ecclesiastical prizes which the leaders were then dividing amongst them.2 When, therefore, Lesly brought from him his assurances of fidelity, warned his mistress to beware of the intrigues and ambition of her brother, the Lord James, and hinted that he had designs against the Crown, it is not surprising that Mary listened to his communication with incredulity.3 She, however, received the envoy with kindness, and commanded him to remain near her person.* To Murray her behaviour was more warm and 1 He arrived sometime before the 9th of April, and did not see his Sovereign, the queen, till the 14th of the same month.

He came to her, as he stated, not with any public commission, but impelled by his affection, and anxious to offer her his services, as one who knew the state of parties in her dominions ; and so com pletely did his blunt and open deportment impress her with an opinion of his integrity, that in a few days he had gained a decided influence over the mind of his Sovereign. He appears in his manner of manag ing this difficult mission, to have acted with great address and duplicity. His object, according to the expressive phrase of Lethington, was to \" grope the mind of the young Queen,\" and, having discovered her intentions, to shape his counsels and his conduct so as best to secure the interests of the Congregation, the friendship of Elizabeth, and the preservation of his own power. Had Mary been aware that the man in whom she was about to confide, had already made Elizabeth and Cecil participant in his intentions, and that nothing was to be done in Scottish matters without consulting the English Queen, she would have hesitated before she gave entire credit to one so likely to abuse it ; but of this she was ignorant ; and the Romish party, who had attempted to put her on her guard, were not themselves above suspicion. D'Osell, in whom she placed much confidence, was untrue to her ; and acting in the interest of Elizabeth,1 advised her to confide implicitly in the Lord James. Her temper was open and unsuspicious, and one of the most fatal faults in her character was the facility with 1 This is quite apparent from the secret correspondence of Throck morton and Cecil, in the State Paper Office."], [287, "1561. MARY. 255 which her affections were engaged, and the dangerous and rapid reliance she was disposed to place in all whom she trusted. She listened therefore to her bro ther with a generous forgetfulness of the part which, as she believed, his conscientious adherence to the re formed faith had compelled him to take against her; and when he pressed her to return to her dominions, and assured her of a cordial welcome from himself and her subjects,1 she flattered herself his protesta tions were sincere, and disclosed to him her intentions with an imprudent precipitation. She declared that she would never ratify the treaty of Edinburgh, till she came into Scotland and took the advice of her Parliament. She did not scruple to admit, that the amity between England and Scotland was little agreeable to her, and that, considering the terms of the league lately made betwixt the two realms, she was anxious to have it dissolved. It was evident also to the Lord James, from the expressions of the Queen, that she would never marry the Earl of Arran ; but was anxious to procure the consent of her subjects to a union with some foreign prince. She had sent her commands that no Parliament should be assembled, and no business of importance concluded, till she had personally met with her people; and she confessed that her present intention was to return to Scotland, not through England, but by sea.2 Notwithstanding all this, there is reason to believe 1 MS.

To leave France, where, as the Queen of one of the first monarchies in Europe, she was accustomed to all the splendour and adulation attendant upon so high a rank, where she had been the attractive centre of a refined court, to repair to an inferior kingdom, inhabited by a ruder people, who spoke of her as an idolatress and an enemy, was sufficiently appalling. But other reasons weighed with her, and produced delay. Her hand was now solicited by some of the greatest princes on the continent, and the same suitors who had courted Elizabeth, and whom that Queen felt a pride in keeping in her train, now offered an unpardonable affront to her vanity by transferring their admiration to her beautiful rival. The King of Denmark, reputed to be by sea the strongest prince in Christendom, had offered to enter into a strict league with France, should he succeed in his addresses to Mary.1 The King of Sweden had despatched an Embassy proposing himself in marriage ; and at this very time the jealous and busy eye of Throckmorton had detected a secret overture for a matrimonial alliance with the Prince of Spain, which created alarm to the English ambassador, and did not escape the watchful observation of the Lord James.2 To 1 MS.

But, prior to her final resolution, both the Queen and the Guises, endea voured with great earnestness to induce him to embrace the Romish faith. He was offered a Cardi nal's hat, and the highest advancement, should he prefer an ecclesiastical to a civil career, but he resisted every bribe, remaining true to the reformed faith and his engagements with England. This firm ness in his purpose rather raised than lowered him in the esteem of the Queen, his sister.

It is now your Majesty's time, and never shall you have a better opportunity, to work the Scottish affection to your devotion.\" Another passage from the same letter, eulogising the Lord James, proves that Elizabeth had already by somesubstantial consideration, orasThrock- morton expresses it, \" some good turn,\" engaged him in her service ; and demonstrates in strong language the system of corruption by which Throckmorton ad* vised that the assistance of the leading lay reformers of Scotland should be secured. \" Lastly,\" said he, \"I do well perceive the Lord James to be a very honorable, sincere, and godly gentleman, and very much affected to your Majesty, upon whom you never bestowed good turn better than on him, in my opinion. He is a man, in my simple judgment, for many respects much worthy to be cherished, and his amity to be well embraced and entertained. For besides his own well deserving, he is as well able to serve your Majesty by himself and his friends, as any man there in Scotland.

She naturally dreaded the influence of the Protestant party in France, and of Elizabeth in England ; and when she found that her wishes were not obeyed, she dismissed the gentleman by whom he expected to receive the commission appointing him Governor, with a brief intimation that she meant to entrust that authority to no person till her own arrival in her dominions. \" The special cause,\" says Throckmorton in writing to the Queen of England, \" why she hath changed her opinion for the Lord James, as I hear, is that she could by no means dissuade him from his devotion and good opinion towards your Majesty, and the observation of the league between your Majesty and the realm of Scotland, and also that neither she nor the Cardinal Lorraine could win nor divert him from his religion, wherein they used very great means and persuasions.

He found there Noailles, the French Ambassador, who during his absence, had been sent by Mary to communicate her wishes and intention, and soon after his arrival, in the end of May,2 a convention of the nobility was held in which the Protestant party carried some violent reso lutions against renewing the league with France.' At this assembly Noailles, the French Ambassador, received his audience, and having urged them to break with England, met with a decided refusal. They reminded him of the late cruel war which the French had carried on in Scotland, of the sea sonable assistance of Elizabeth, and of the ty ranny of the Romish clergy, whom, instead of pastors, they had found to be wolves, thieves, and murderers of the flock.

God, and to enter again into alliance with those who were the sworn vassals of that Papal ty rannp which they had cast off, was, they declared, a proceeding to which they never would give their consent. With this reply, Noailles returned to France, and Elizabeth judging this a proper conjuncture to make a last effort to procure from Mary the ratification of the treaty of Edinburgh, instructed Throckmorton, her Ambassador at Paris, to visit her for this purpose. His request was temperately, but de cidedly denied. The Scottish Queen informed him, that she had now finally resolved to return to her dominions in Scotland, where she would have an opportunity of consulting the Estates \"of her Realm, without whose advice it would be improper for her to act in this matter ; she added, that she had resolved to withdraw all Frenchmen from Scotland ; that she regretted their presence had given dis content to her subjects, and excited jealousy in her good sister, but that nothing should be left undone to satisfy the Queen of England, from whom she ex pected the like good offices in return. Throckmor ton observed in reply, that it seemed superfluous to delay the ratification of the treaty, till she had obtained the advice of her nobles and the Estates of the Realm, of whose opinion there could be no doubt as the treaty was made by their consent ; \" Yea,\" said Mary, \" by some of them, but not by all.

But of this I assure you, Mons. l'Ambassadeur, I for my part am very desirous to have the perfect and the assured amity of the Queen, my good sister, and I will use all the means I can to give her occasion to think that I mean it indeed.'' \" I answered (says Throckmorton), Madam, the Queen, my mistress, you may be assured will use the like towards you, to move you to be of the same opinion towards her. \" Then,\" said she, \" I trust the Queen, your mistress, will not support nor encourage any of my subjects to continue in their disobedience, nor take upon them things which appertaineth not to subjects. You know,\" quoth she, \" there is much ado in my realm, about the matters of religion, and though there be a greater number of a contrary religion to me than I would there were, yet there is no reason that subjects should give a law to their sovereign, and specially in matters of religion, which I fear, quoth she, my subjects will take in hand.\" In reply to this the Ambassador adverted to the great changes in religion which had taken place in Scotland, and to the fact that the majority in that kingdom were Pro testants. Mary admitted this, and allowed that there was much room for reformation in the Romish Church, but observed at the same time, that she was none of those who could change their religion every year. \" I mean,\" said she, \" to constrain none of my subjects, but would wish that they were all as I am, aud I trust they shall have no support to constrain"], [298, "266 1561. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. me.\"1 Mary, as we see from this interview, had re solved to visit her dominions, but although she could thus ably reply to so experienced a diplomatist as Throckmorton, it was her peculiar misfortune, that she gave her confidence to those who betrayed it to her adversaries; she despatched D'Osell, who enjoyed much credit with her, to solicit a passport from the English Queen; he was accompanied by a gentle man,'2 who was to bring it to France, whilst he pursued his journey into Scotland to prepare for his mistress's reception. But D'Osell was altogether unworthy of the trust reposed in him ; he communi cated to Throckmorton, previous to setting out, the intended movements of the Queen, and on being admitted to an audience disclosed them to Elizabeth, and advised with her how she ought to proceed. She accordingly refused the passport, with much acri mony and violence gave secret orders for the prepa ration of some ships of war, which, under pretence of scouring the seas for pirates, were to watch for the Scottish Queen, and instead of permitting D'Osell to continue his journey to Scotland, sent him back to Paris, to inform Mary of her resolution, and secretly to communicate her intentions to Throckmorton. This Ambassador, in a letter to Cecil, expresses sur prise and regret at this change of measures. \" I do somewhat marvel,\" says he, \" at this resolution on the Queen of Scotland's demand fora passage, and the 1 Keith, p. 167. 2 Orig, St. P.

Which to do, neither the one nor the other, cannot have such commodity, if she were in Scotland. I think also upon that you write, that your friends in Scotland will most allow that resolu tion ; whereat I somewhat muse, seeing the Lord James at his late being here wrought what he could, and in the same mind hath continued to persuade the said Queen, his sister, to come home, and if lie be now of another mind, I knoio not what he meaneth. But if he persist in his former opinion, then it may be feared, that you shall offend more than the Queen of Scotland.\" Throckmorton next alluded to the idea of intercepting Mary. * * * Because, said he, I hear nothing of such as come from thence (England) of any equipage or force by sea in readiness to empesche the Queen of Scotland's passage, or to make that good that Monsieur D'Osell hath reported here her Majesty said unto him ; which was, that her Majesty would provide to keep the Queen of Scotland from passing home, I have thought good to say* thus much to you, that better it had been if no such thing had been said, but passage"], [300, "1561. 268 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. granted, if no provision or show be made to era- pesche her indeed. * * * And yet I will not advise you to counsel the Queen to be at any great cost, in- asmuch as the truth and certainty of the Queen of Scotland's journey is not known, nor the certain place of her embarking.'' To this letter this emphatic postcript is added. \" If you mind to catch the Queen of Scots, your ships must search and see all, for she meaneth rather to steal away than to pass with force.\" * There is another passage in a letter from Cecil to the Earl of Sussex, which throws a clear light on this refusal of the passport, and establishes the point that Murray and the Protestant party in Scotland were anxious that she should not be per- mitted to return to her kingdom. \" Monsieur D'Osell,\" says he, \"came from the Scots Queen, with the request that the Queen his mistress, might have a safe-con- duct to pass along our sea-coasts, and himself to pass into Scotland to provide for her coming. Many reasons moved us to mislike her passage, but this only served us for answer, that where she had pro- mised to send the Queen's Majesty a good answer for the ratification of the last league of peace, made at Edinburgh, and now had sent none, her Majesty would not disguise with her, but plainly would for bear to show her such pleasure until she should ratify it, and that done, she should not only have free passage, but all helps and gratuities.

This proceeding will like the Scots ivell.\"'1 At this moment the seas were much infested by pirates, and the English Queen who dreaded the ex pense and the obloquy to which she would be ex posed if she openly prepared a fleet to intercept Mary, took advantage of this circumstance to put out to sea some ships of war, with the avowed object of protecting her merchants, but with secret instruc tions to be on the watch for the Scottish Queen, and not to suffer her to pass.2 The refusal of a passport by Elizabeth deeply wounded Mary, but although she dreaded the hos tile intentions of that Queen, her preparations were now so far advanced, that she determined they should not be countermanded. On the 26th July, she gave a final audience to the English Ambassador, and of this interview we have fortunately a minute and in teresting account transmitted by Throckmorton to his royal mistress.

When the Ambassador was introduced, she com manded all the audience to retire. \" I know not well,\" said she, \" my own infirmity, nor how far I may with my passion be transported, but I like not to have so many witnesses of rny passions as the Queen, your mistress, was content to have when she talked with Monsieur D'Osell.\" She then continued, \" There is nothing Monsieur l'Ambassadeur, doth more grieve me, than that I did so forget myself, as to require of the Queen, your mistress, that favour which I had no need to ask. I needed no more to have made her privy to my journey than she doth me of hers. I may pass well enough home into mine own realm, I think, without her passport or license; for though the late King, your master, used all the impeachment he could, both to stay me and catch me when I came hither, yet yTou know, Monsieur l'Ambassadeui*, I came hither, safely, and I may have as good means to help me home again, as I had to come hither, if I would employ my friends.

But Monsieur rAmbassadeur, let your mistress think that it will be deemed very strange amongst all princes and countries, that she should first animate my subjects against me, and now, being a widow, impeach my going into my own country. I ask of her nothing but friendship ; I do not trouble her state, nor prac tise with her subjects. And yet, I know there be in her realm some that be inclined enough to hear offers. I know also, they be not of the same mind she is of, neither in religion, nor in other things. The Queen, your mistress, doth say that I am young, and do lack experience.

Throckmorton, in reply, ex cused the conduct of the English Queen, and fell back upon the old topics of complaint, the assump tion of the arms and title of England, and the delay to ratify the treaty of Edinburgh. On both points Mary was prepared to answer him. \" You know,\" said she, \" that when I assumed the style and arms of Eng land, I was under the commandment of King Henry*, my father, and of the King, my lord and husband ; whatsoever was then done, was their act, not mine, and since their death, I have neither borne the arms, nor used the title of England.\" With regard to the treaty, upon which so much has been said, she contended that without the advice of the Coun cil of her realm, it was impossible she could come to a decision on so grave a matter, which required the mature deliberation of the wisest amongst them. \" This,\" said she, \" I cannot have, until I return to my dominions ; I am about to haste me home, as fast as I may, to the intent the matters may be answered : and now the Queen, your mistress, will in no wise suffer me neither to pass home, nor him that I sent into my realm, so as, Monsieur l'Ambassadeur, it seemeth the Queen, your mistress, will be the cause why in this matter she is not satisfied, or else she will not be satisfied, but liketh to make this matter a quarrel still betwixt us, whereof she is the author.\"1 1 Keith, pp. 171, 175."], [305, "1560 273 MARY On the 21st of July, Throckmorton took leave of Mary, regretting that the terms upon which she then stood with regard to the English Queen, did not pernlit him to wait upon her at her embarkation. Her reply was affecting, and seemed almost to shadow forth her future fate. \" If,\" said she, \" my preparations were not so much advanced as they are, peradventure the Queen, your mistress's unkindness might stay my voyage, but now I am determined to adventure the matter, whatsoever come of it. I trust the wind will be so favourable, as I shall not need to come on the coast of England, and if I do, then, Monsieur l'Ambassadeur, the Queen, your mistress, shall have me in her hands to do her will of me, and if she be so hard hearted as to desire my end, she may then do her pleasure, and make sacrifice of me, peradventure, that casualty might be better for me than to live : in this matter God's will be ful filled.\" ' These melancholy forebodings were not, however, at this moment destined to be realised; Mary, having left Paris on the 21st of July, was accompanied as far as St. Germain by the King of France, the Queen Mother, the King of Navarre, and other persons of the first rank. Here, after a few days' stay, she bad adieu to the Royal Family, and attended by the Duke of Guise, the Cardinals of Lorraine and Guise, the Grand Prior, who was general of the French galleys, and other noble 1 Keith, p. 176.

It happened that there was a calm during the night, the ships made little wa}*, and in the morning, the French coast was still discernible.8 The Queen sat up in bed, and straining her eyes till the shore faded from her sight, pathetically bad adieu to the beautiful country where she had passed her happiestyears. \"Farewell France,\" said she, \" beloved France, I shall never see thee more !\" Soon after this, a favourable wind sprung up, accompanied by a fog, under cover of which the Queen's galleys escaped the English ships, and arrived in the Port of Leith on the 19th of August, 1561 ; one vessel, however, in which was the Earl of Eglinton, was captured by Elizabeth's cruisers, and carried into port, but as soon as it was disco vered that the young* Queen was not on board, the prize was released, and pursued her voyage into Scotland.

The pomp of the procession, if we may believe Brantome, an eye-witness, was far inferior to the brilliant pageants to which she had been accustomed ; she could not repress a sigh when she beheld the sorry palfreys prepared for herself and her ladies, and when awakened on the morning after her arrival, 1 Instructions to Lethington, sent Ambassador to England.

Here the matter rested till the Queen's arrival, but the more intolerant of the Protestants had early made up their minds to resist by force every attempt to raise the \" Idol\" once more in the land. They drew no dis tinction between the idolatry of the Jews, which was punished by death, and the idolatry of the Roman ists ; both were in their eyes maintainers of the ac cursed thing which was hateful to God. It was even 1 Brantome, vol. ii. pp. 123, 124. Mary arrived unexpectedly early in the morning of the 19th August, and the weather was so dark and stormy, that the ships were not seen for the fog.

And when the master of Lindsay, a furious zealot, heard that it was about to be celebrated, he buckled on his harness, assembled his followers, and rushing into the court of the palace, shouted aloud that the priests should die the death. The Lord James, however, op posed this violence, placed himself at the door of the chapel, overawed the multitude, and preserved the lives of the chaplains who officiated, for which he was bitterly and ironically attacked by Knox.1 The Queen, although she claimed for herself the toleration which she extended to her subjects, was anxious to prevent any misconception of her in tentions with regard to religion. It had been de clared in council, that no alterations should be made, and she now published a Proclamation, in which she assured her subjects of her determination to maintain the Protestant form of worship, which she found established at her arrival, and added, that no one should be permitted, under pain of death, to attempt, either publicly or privately, any innovation upon the national faith.2 Nor was this all ; although Knox's sincere, but ill-advised zeal, had done much to excite her opposition, the Queen, to the astonish ment of the Romish party, desired to have an inter view with the reformer, who has himself left us 1 Knox's Hist, of Reformation, p. 306. 2 Knox, p. 307- Corroborated by a Letter of Randolph's to Cecil. 3d June, 1563.\u2014 Keith, p. 239."], [310, "1561. 278 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. an account of their conversation. She blamed him for the violence of his book against female govern- ment, and with a clearness and vigour of argument, for which he was probably not prepared, pointed out its evil consequences, in exciting subjects against their rulers. She then advised him to treat with greater charity those who differed from him in opinion. \" If, madam,\" said he, \"to rebuke idolatry and to persuade the people to worship God accord- ing to his word, be to raise subjects against their Princes, I cannot stand excused, for so have I acted; but if the true knowledge of God and his right wor- shipping lead all good subjects (as they assuredly do) to obey the Prince from their heart, then who can reprehend me.\" As for his book, he allowed it was directed against female government, but excused its principles, as being more matters of opinion than of conscience, and professed his willingness to live in all contentment under her Majesty's Government, as long as she kept her hands undefiled by the blood of the saints of God. He contended, that in religion subjects were bound to follow, not the will of their Prince, but the commands of their Creator. \"If,\" said he, \" all men in the days of the Apostles, should have been compelled to follow the religion of the Roman Emperors, where would have been the Christian faith. Daniel and his fellows were sub jects to Nebuchadnezzar and Darius, and yet they refused to be of their religion.\" \" But,\" interrupted the Queen, \" these men did not resist.'' \"And yet,\" re- plied Knox, \" they who obey not the commandment,"], [311, "1561. MARY. 279 may virtually be said to resist.\" \" Nay,\" rejoined Mary, \" they did not resist with the sword.\" \" That,\" said Knox, \" was simply because they had not the power.\" \" What,\" cried the Queen, starting and speak ing with great energy, \" do you maintain that subjects having power may resist their Princes?'' \" Most assu redly,\" continued the Reformer, \" if Princes exceed their bounds. God hath no where commanded higher reverence to be given to Kings by their subjects, than to parents by their children ; and yet, if a father or mo ther be struck with madness, and attempt to slay his children, they may lawfully bind and disarm him till the phrenzy be overpast. It is even so, madam,\" continued this stern champion of resistance, fixing his eyes upon the young Queen, and raising his voice to a tone, which almost amounted to a me nace, \"it is even so with Princes that would murder the children of God, who may be their sub jects. Their blind zeal is nothing but a mad phrenzy, and therefore, to take the sword from them, to bind their hands, and to cast them into prison, till they be brought to a more sober mind, is no disobedience against Princes, but just obedience, because it agreeth with the word of God.\" At these words Mary stood for some time silent and amazed \u2014 she was terrified by the violence with which they were uttered. She thought of her own youth and weak ness ; of the fierce zealots by whom she was sur rounded ; her mind pictured to itself, in gloomy anti cipation, the struggles which awaited her, and she burst into tears. On being comforted and soothed"], [312, "1561. 280 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. by Murray, who alone was present at the interview, she at length collected herself, and said, turn- ing to Knox, \" Well then, I perceive that my sub- jects shall only obey you, and not me ; they must do what they list, not what I command ; whilst I must learn to be subject unto them, and not they to me.\" \" God forbid,\" said the Reformer, \" that it should ever be so ; far be it from me to command any, or to absolve subjects from their lawful obedi- ence. My only desire is, that both Princes and sub- jects should obey God, who has in his word en- joined Kings to be nursing fathers, and Queens nursing mothers to his Church\" \" Yea,\" quoth Mary, \" this is indeed true, but your's is not the Church that I will nourish. I will defend the Church of Rome, for I think it the true Church of God.\" At this strong assertion of her belief, the indignation of Knox flamed fierce and high. \" Your will,\" said he, \"madam, is no reason; neither doth your thought make that Roman Harlot to be the immacu- late spouse of Christ. And wonder not, madam, that I call Rome an Harlot, for that Church is alto- gether polluted with every kind of spiritual abomina- tion, as well in doctrine as in manners.

Alluding to the conferences between Mary and Knox, Lething ton, in a letter to Cecil, did justice to the gentleness of the Queen, and contrasted it with the harshness of her opponent. \"You know,\" said he, \"the vehe mency of Mr. Knox's spirit, which cannot be bridled, and yet doth sometimes utter such sentences as cannot 1 Knox, Hist. pp. 311, 315, inclusive."], [314, "1561. 282 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. easily be digested by a weak stomach. I could wish he would deal with her more gently, being a young Princess unpersuaded. For this I am accounted too politic, but surely in her comporting with him, she doth declare a wisdom far exceeding her age. God grant her the assistance of his spirit: surely I see in her a good towardness, and think that the Queen, your sovereign, shall be able to do much with her in religion, if they once enter into a good familiarity.\"1 That they might enter into this familiarity, was now the great object of Mary and her ministers. Elizabeth had congratulated her on her happy return to her dominions, and she soon after (Sept. 1st 1561) de spatched Lethington, her chief secretary, on a mission to England, to express her earnest wishes for the continuance of peace.2 Not long after, she took a triumphant pro gress from her palace to the castle of Edinburgh. Fifty black slaves, magnificently apparelled, received her at the west gate of the city,3 sixteen of the chief citizens bore a canopy, under which she rode in state, and a public banquet was given to the Queen and the noble strangers by whom she was accompanied. The pageants exhibited on this occasion, marked, indeed, the character of the times.

To the zealous burghers, these dramas contained a wholesome signification of God's vengeance against idolators ; to others, as sincere but less fanatical, they appeared unwise incitements to persecution. By those against whom they were directed, although not unnoticed, they were passed over in silence.1 It was the anxious desire of the Queen to give her kingdom time to recover the effects of the war and anarchy to which it had been so long exposed. She had determined, before leaving France, to make every sacrifice to conciliate Elizabeth ; nor was this resolution adopted without a great end in view. Her title to the throne of England was still present to her mind. Her claim to the Crown, and her assumption of the arms of this kingdom, had, as we have seen, been injudiciously published by her uncles, when she wasstillQueenof France. Mary had, indeed, apologised for such conduct, and transferred the blame of so strange and premature a measure to her advisers, the Guises, but it was still her earnest desire to have her title to the Crown of England recognised by that Princess, should she persevere in her vows of celi bacy, and as the surest means to obtain this object, she committed the chief management of her affairs to Murray and Lethington, the great leaders of the 1 Keith, p. 189."], [316, "1561. 284 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Protestant party. Lethington had proposed this scheme to Cecil soon after the death of the French King, and when anticipating the return of Mary to her dominions, he felt all the peril of his own situa tion; should he be able to carry this point for the Scottish Queen, he knew he was safe ; if he failed \u2014 if she broke with Elizabeth, and threw herself into the interest of France\u2014 he looked upon it as certain ruin. \" I made you,\" says he, in a letter to Cecil (6th February, 1560-1), \" some overture at London, how to salve all matters. I wrote to you more amply in it from Sir R. Sadler's house. I would be glad to understand what you think in it, or how the Queen's Majesty can like of it, and how it shall be followed. I know the Queen, my sovereign, is so informed against me, that unless I be able to do her some service, I cannot long be suffered to live in her realm, and I will never press to continue in service longer than the amity betwixt both realms shall continue.\"1 Lethington was no doubt perfectly sincere in his desire to carry this point in favour of his mistress ; and it is remarkable, that about six months after he had written to Cecil, and shortly previous to Mary's arrival in Scotland, the Lord James had addressed a letter to the Queen of England on the same delicate subject. In this epistle, which is ably and powerfully written, he congratulated this Princess that the ancient enmity between the two nations had been miraculously converted into recipro- 1 MS.

The only point which had occasioned dissention between them was, he goes on to observe, the premature discussion of his mistress's title. \" I wish to God,\" said he, \" my sovereign lady had never, by any advice, taken in head to pretend interest or claim any title to your Majesty's realm, for then I am fully persuaded you should have been and continued as dear friends as you be tender cousins ; but now since on her part something hath been thought of it, and first motioned when the two realms were in war together, your Majesty knoweth, I fear, that unless that root may be removed, it shall ever breed unkindness between you. Your Majesty cannot yield, and she may on the other part think it hard, being so nigh of the blood of England, so to be made a stranger from it.'* The Lord James then ventures on the dangerous ground of the succession. \" If,\" says he, \" any midway could be picked out to remove this difference to both your contentments, then it is like we should have a per petual quietness.

The succession of realms cometh by God's appointment, according to his good pleasure, and no provision of man can alter that which he hath determined, but it must needs come to pass ; yet is there appearance, that without injury of any party, this accord might breed us great quietness. Every thing must have some beginning. If I may receive answer from your Majesty, that you will allow of any such agreement, I will travel with the Queen, my sovereign, to do what I can to bring her to some conformity.

Whether it ever reached the Queen's eye is uncertain ; and as the Scottish Baron had fearlessly ventured on ground which the more wary Cecil scarcely dared to tread, it is proba ble he did not risk its delivery, but it proves that the Lord James was sincerely attached on this subject to the interests of his sister, the Queen. It is worthy of remark, also, that in this grand design, we are fur nished with the key to the policy adopted by Mary during the first years of her government. Thus, the same reasons which induced her to favour the Pro testants, led her to depress the Romanist party, at the head of whom was Huntly, one of the most powerful, crafty, and unscrupulous men in the country, against whom the Lord James placed himself in mortal opposition.1 It was not to be expected that the bishops and the Romish peers should bear this with equanimity. They had suffered severely in the cause of the Queen ; they naturally looked to her return, as the season when their fidelity was to be rewarded, and their feelings were proportionally bitter when they found themselves treated with neg- 1 Soon after the Queen's arrival, Randolph informed Cecil that Huntly and this potent Baron greatly discorded.

It was their present policy to temporize. In an overture to Throck morton, the English ambassador, the Duke of Guise, repeated the proposal of the Lord James, that Eliza beth should declare Mary her successor.2 It was their object at the same time to procure the re newal of the league with France, and the co-oper ation of the Queen, their niece, in their vast and unprincipled schemes ; and if they failed \u2014 if Mary declined their great offers, and refused to \" hang her keys at their girdle,\" they had resolved to form a faction against her, at the head of which should be Chastelherault, Arran, Huntly, and Hume.3 Without appearing to notice the plots of the Ro manists with France, Mary steadily followed out her design of conciliating the Protestants, and obtaining the friendship of England.

In his mission to the English Court, Lethington urged upon Eliza beth the necessity of declaring Mary her successor. His public instructions, indeed, did not authorise him to enter upon this delicate subject, which has led Keith to question, whether it was now broached at all ; but we know from Throckmorton's letters, not only that the proposal was made, but that Cecil was much em barrassed by it. \" For the matter,\" says he, \" lately proposed to her Majesty by the Laird of Ledington, in which to deal one way or other, you find diffi culties, even so do I think, that not to deal in it at all, no manner of way, is more dangerous ; as well for the Queen's Majesty, as for the realm, and specially if God should deal so unmercifully with us, as to take the Queen from us without issue ; which God forbid, considering the terms the State standeth in presently.\"3 For the moment, Elizabeth evaded 1 Spottiswood, p. 179 8 8th Nov. 1561.

Pro ceeding to Jedburgh and Dumfries, with an army which rendered opposition useless, he pursued the thieves into their strong holds, rased their towers to the ground, hanged twenty of the most notorious offenders, sent fifty more in chains to Edinburgh, and in a meeting with the English Wardens, Lord Gray and Sir John Foster, restored order and good government to the marches.2 During his absence, the Romish Clergy resorted to court, but found a colder reception than they anticipated, and although Mons. de Moret, who had been sent from the Duke of Savoy, endeavoured to influence the Queen in favour of the Romanists, his power was either very slight,3 or it suited the tortuous politics of the Guises, to encourage at this moment the amity between Mary and Elizabeth. In speaking of an intended interview between the princesses, the proposal of which had come from Mary, Lethington assured Cecil, that France earnestly 1 Treasurer's Accounts, 19th Oct. 1561.

Notwithstanding the full establishment of the Reformation, the Protestant ministers were in a state of extreme poverty, and dependant upon the precari ous assistance of their flock ; whilst the revenues of the Church were divided between the nobles, who had appropriated them to themselves, and the Romish prelates, who still retained part of their ancient wealth. On the meeting of the General Assembly, the ministers determined to use their most strenuous efforts to procure some support out of the ecclesiasti cal revenues, yet the attempt was resisted by many of the barons, who had been zealous supporters of the Reformation, but loved its plunder better than its principles. The rulers of the court began, as Knox says, to draw themselves apart from the society of their brethren ; and to strive and grudge.3 Lething- 1 MS. Letter, St. P.

The barons, who had been accus tomed to take a part in its proceedings, separated from their brethren, and although after a violent discus sion they reluctantly concurred in its legality, yet they steadily refused to pass the Book of Disci pline, and thwarted, though they did not openly oppose, the measures for the provision of the clergy. After some consultation, however, an Act was passed ordaining the annual revenues of the whole benefices in the realm to be produced, and out of this gross sum, the Romish Clergy consented to give a third to the Queen, being permitted to retain two-thirds for themselves. This third was to be appropriated to the maintenance of preachers, the endowment of schools, the support of the poor, and the increase of the reve nue of the Crown.1 Before this proposal was made, the funds of the Romish Church, previously immense, had been greatly dilapidated. On the overthrow of Popery, the Bishops and other dignified clergy had entered into transactions with their friends or kinsmen, by which large portions of ecclesiastical property 1 Knox, pp. 321, 324, inclusive."], [325, "1561 MARY 293 passed into private hands ; in some cases, sales had been made by the ancient incumbents, or leases had been purchased by strangers, which the Pope, zealous to protect his persecuted children, had con firmed. The Crown, too, had appointed laymen to be factors or administrators of bishopricks and livings-, so that by these various methods, the property of the Church was so much diffused and curtailed, that the third of all the money collected fell far below the sum necessary to give an adequate support to the clergy. There was much fraud also practised in making up the returns. Many of the Romish Clergy evaded the production of their rentals, some gave in false estimates, and although the persons appointed to fix the rate of provision had been the firm supporters of the Reformation, though the Lord James, and Maitland of Lethington, with Argile and Morton, superintended every step, the result disappointed the expectations of the ministers. It was asserted, that the only effect of the change was, to secure a large share for the lay proprietors of church lands, to transfer a considerable portion to the Crown, and to leave a wretched pittance for the ministers. Yet, when fairly viewed, the change was certainly credit able to the Queen, and involved a concession which ought to have been considered valuable and important. It was a legal recognition of the right of the Presby terian ministers, to be supported by the state, and ought to have convinced all gainsayers that Mary, though she insisted on her private mass, considered the reformed religion as the established faith of the"], [326, "1561. 294 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. country. This was no little matter, yet no party was pleased. Knox and the ministers were discontented, not only that they received so little, but because in the same assembly the Mass was permitted, and the Book of Discipline refused : the Romish faction, were still louder in their complaints, and declared, that nothing now was wanting but an interview between Mary and Elizabeth, to the utter overthrow of the ancient faith. Cecil, whilst he rejoiced that the Bishops were spoiled, lamented that their riches should, even in part have fallen to the Crown, and the satirical vein of Randolph ascribed all to the worst motives. \" Where your honour,\" says he, addressing Cecil, \" liketh better the diminution of the Bishops and other livings, than the augmen tation of the Crown therewith, what can I better say than that which I find written \" Merx meritricis, et ad meretrices reversa est.\" I find it neither done for zeal to Christ's religion, nor hatred to the viciousness of their lives that had it.

They re garded the prelacy of England as little better than the Popery of Rome, and preferred that their Queen should remain an obstinate Papist, rather than take refuge in a religion which had as little ground in the word of God. \" Our Papists,\" said Randolph, addressing Cecil, \" greatly mistrust the meeting, our Protestants as greatly desire it, our preachers, to be plain with your honour, at one word, be more vehement than discreet or learned, which I heartily lament.

This disposed people to give some credit to the present conspiracy. It was observed that Arran, showed no symptoms of insanity when he first disco vered the enterprise; and the profligate character of Bothwell confirmed their belief.

At first he explained the intention of the conspirators with great clearness, but soon after, his disclosures exhibited signs of derangement; he began to talk of devils and enchantments, affirmed that he had been bewitched by the mother of the Lord James, whom he spoke of as a noted sorceress, retracted much of his former story, and became so incoherent, that for security, rather than punishment, he was committed to ward in the castle.1 His alleged accomplices, Bothwell and the Abbot of Kilwinning were imprisoned, some things appear ing suspicious in their conduct, but to the aged Duke, who protested his innocence, and with tears bewailed the ruin of his house, Mary behaved with great tenderness. A passage from a letter of Ran dolph to Elizabeth is important in the picture it gives of her gentleness, justice, and impartiality, upon this trying occasion. The English Queen and Cecil, who knew well the violence with which Arran had opposed himself to the Queen, imagined that Mary, in her re sentment might be ready to believe any thing against him. Randolph, however, completely refutes this unworthynotion. \" For the likelihood,\" says he, \" that the Queen is not moved with any evil mind towards the Duke or his, besides that which I have heard her Grace say, I will only declare unto your Majesty that 1 MS.

This was clearly shown at the present moment ; for the English Queen having discovered some sus picious intercourse between the Earl of Lennox and the Romish faction believed it to be a plot for the marriage of the Scottish Queen with Lord Darn ley, and suddenly committed Lennox, and his Countess, Lady Margaret, the niece of Henry the 1 MS.

Of these crimes, the great centre was Hawick, and the Queen, who was determined to make an example, armed the Earl of Mar with full powers against the offenders. Nor was his suc cess less than on his former expedition. Making a sudden and rapid march, he encompassed the town with his soldiers, entered the market-place, and by proclamation forbad any citizen, on pain of death, to receive or shelter a thief.

It was this feeling, probably, which induced her to receive with caution, though with her accustomed courtesy, the ambassador of the King of Sweden, who, about this time (June 3rd, 1562) arrived on a matrimonial mission in Scotland. He brought with him a whole length portrait of his master, which he delivered to one of the Marys,1 to be presented to the Queen, who hung it up in her private cabinet, and dismissed him with letters and a safe-conduct for the Swedish monarch and his navy to land within any port of her realm which they might find most convenient.2 This Prince had already made proposals to Elizabeth, which were coldly received ; but Mary was aware of the jealousy of her nature, and the danger of appearing to interfere with her admirers, and she now looked anxiously for the return of Lethington. At length this Minister arrived with the welcome intelligence that the English Queen had consented to the interview.

It pleased her Grace immediately after she had conferred with the Lord of Ledington, and had received my Sovereign's picture, to send for me. After she had rehearsed many such purposes, as by the Lord of Ledington's report unto her Grace had been spoken of her, by my Sovereign, touching her sisterly affection towards her, her good will and earnest desire to continue in peace and amity, and, in special, that they might see each other, she sheweth unto me my said Sovereign's picture, and asketh me how like that was unto her lively face ? I answered unto her, that I trusted that her Grace should shortly be judge thereof herself, and find much more perfection than could be set forth by the art of man. \"That,\" saith she, \" is the thing that I have most desired, ever since I was in hope thereof, and she shall well assure herself there shall be no stay in me, though it were to take any pains, or to do more than I may well say ; and I trust by that time that we have spoken together, our hearts will be so eased, that the greatest grief that ever after shall be between us, will be when we shall take leave the one of the other. And let God be my witness, I honour her in my heart, and love her as my dear and natural sister.

To resolve, therefore, with your Honour herein, I find in this Queen so much good will as can be possible ; in many of her subjects no less desire than in herself; the rest not such that any such account is to be made of, that either they can hinder the purpose, or do great good, whatsomever they become.\"1 All things being thus in readiness for the interview, and Mary looking* forward to it with the ardent and sanguine feelings which belonged to her character, an unexpected obstacle arose from the quarter of France. In that country, the religious and political struggle between the Romish party and the Protest ants suddenly assumed a more fierce and sanguinary aspect ; and the Queen of England, who steadily supported Coligni and the Protestants, resolved to remain for the whole summer at home, to watch the proceedings of the league which France, Spain, Savoy, and Rome had organized against the common cause of the Reformation. It may, indeed, be doubted, whether Elizabeth was ever sincere in her wish to have a meeting with Mary. It is at least certain, that she readily seized this cause of delay, and in July despatched Sir Henry Sidney into 1 MS. Letter. St. P. Off. Randolph to Cecil. 15th July, 1563. VOL. VI.

She listened to his embassy, as he himself reports, \"with watery eyes;\" and Mar and Lethington assured him, that had she not already found a vent for her passionate grief in her private chamber, the expression of it would have been still more violent.1 It is evident that her heart was intent upon this object, and the delay may have caused a painful .suspicion of the sincerity of the English Queen, for whose sake she had already made no inconsiderable sacrifices. Yet the mes sage of Elizabeth w as warm Land cordial. She assured Mary, that to have seen her dear sister that summer was her earnest desire ; that she now delayed the meeting with the utmost reluctance, and had so fully determined to enjoy her company in the spring, that she had sent by Sidney her confirmation of the treaty for the interview, leaving it to her to fix upon any days between the 20th of May and the last of August.2 Mary was re-assured, and would instantly have accepted the treaty and named the day of meeting, but most of her Council being absent, Lethington thought it prudent to delay, and promised within a month to send her final resolution.3 1 MS.

The Queen, relieved from this anxiety, now resolved to visit the northern parts of her dominions ; and, following her own inclination rather than the advice of her Council,1 made preparations for her progress as far as Inverness ; but before she set out a Jesuit arrived in Scotland with a secret message from the Pope. So violent at this time was the feeling of the common people against any intercourse with Rome, that Mary did not dare to receive him openly ; but whilst the Protestant nobles were at the sermon, Lethington conveyed him by stealth into the Queen's closet. The preacher, however, was more brief than usual in his discourse, and the Earl of Mar coming* suddenly into the antichamber, had nearly discovered the interview ; so that the Papal envoy was smuggled away by the Mary's with much speed and alarm, yet not before Randolph had caught a glimpse of \" a strange visage,'' which filled him full of suspicion. \" The effect of his legation,\" says this ambassador, \"was to know whether she could send unto the General Council (he means the Council of Trent, then sitting), and he was directed to use his influence to keep her steadfast in her religion ; so at least the secretary assured him, but he believed there was more under this commission than he or Lethington were permitted to see.2 The messenger, who was a Bishop, narrowly escaped ; for 1 MS.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. no sooner was it known that a Papal emissary had dared to set his foot in Scotland, than his death was resolved on; and nothing saved him but the peremp tory remonstrance of Mar.1 Mary now set out on her progress northward, accom panied by most of her principal nobles. At Aberdeen she was met by the Earl of Huntly, the head of the Romish party, and the great rival of Mar. This nobleman was nearly allied to the Duke of Chastel herault, by the marriage of his eldest son, Lord Gordon, to the daughter of Hamilton ; and both Huntly and the Duke, although separated by differ ence of religious faith, were jealous of the power of Mar, and enemies to the strict amity with England. Huntly, indeed, had felt keenly the neglect and want of confidence with which he had been treated by the Queen. She had received with coldness the advances made by him and his party immediately after the death of her husband ; his offer to re-establish the ancient religion on her arrival in her dominions had been repelled ; although he held the high office of Chancellor, and sat in the Privy Council, his influence was merely nominal, and, which cut deeper than all, he discovered that Mar intended to possess himself of the Earldom of Murray, an extensive and opu lent appanage, of which he, for many years back, had enjoyed the revenues and wielded the power. Shortly before this, one of his sons, Sir John Gordon, having a private feud with Lord Ogilvy, had attacked 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Randolph to Cecil. 1st Aug, 1562i"], [341, "1562 MARY 309 and desperately wounded this nobleman in the streets of the capital. The assailant being seized and im prisoned, broke from his confinement and fled to his estates. Mary was exasperated ; but the eloquence of the Countess, his mother, assuaged her resentment, and brought her son to reason. The offender appeared before his Sovereign, and was ordered to ward in the castle of Stirling. When on his road thither, he again repented of his submission, \u2014 escaped from his guards, and gathering a thousand horsemen, bid defiance to the royal power. Such was the state of things when Huntly heard of the Queen's resolution to visit his country, accompanied by Mar and her principal nobility. He had long envied the influence of that Earl with the Queen ; and being strong in friends and possessed of almost sovereign authority in those northern districts, he seems to have had the temerity to believe that the moment had arrived when a revolution might be accomplished, which would rid him of his rival, and place in his hands the chief power of the Government. But Mary suspected his prac tices, and dreaded his ambition. On being pressed by him to visit his house at Strathbogy, of which the magnificence rivalled her own palaces, she declined paying that honour to the father of a rebel ; and pushing forward to the castle of Inverness, where it was her intention to remain for some time, she found its gates insolently shut against her. On the place being summoned, it was answered by the captain, a retainer of Huntly's, that without the orders of Lord Gordon, for whom he held it, the castle should not"], [342, "1562. 310 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. be given up. This was open rebellion ; and Mary, having raised the force of the country, prepared to carry the place by assault. On this occasion the Queen evinced something of the warlike spirit of her ancestors. Instead of lamenting that she had engaged in a journey so full of peril, \"she repented she was not a man, to know what life it was to lie all night in the fields, or walk the rounds with a jack and knap scull.\"1 Her military aspirations, however, were not gratified by an actual siege ; the captain having sur rendered, was hanged ; and Mary, although informed that Huntly watched to intercept her in the woods on the banks of the Spey, advanced against him ; crossed the river without seeing an enemy, and returned at the head of three thousand men to Aberdeen. There was a romance and danger about the expedition which pleased the Queen, and awakened some knightly enthusiasm in Randolph, the English envoy, who accompanied her. \" What desperate blows,\" says he, in his letter to Cecil, \" would that day have been given, when every man should have fought in sight of so noble a Queen, and so many fair ladies, our enemies to have taken them from us, and we to save our honours and not to be bereft of them, your Honour may easily imagine.5'2 Huntly seems to have overrated his strength, but it was now too late to recede ; and his animosity was 1 MS.

He per suaded himself that nothing short of his ruin was contemplated, and having made a last and ineffectual attempt to mollify the royal resentment, he fortified his castles of Finleter, Achendown, and Strathbogy, assembled his vassals, and pushed rapidly to Aber deen, in the hope of seizing the Queen. But the result was disastrous ; as he marched forward, his force melted away, and with scarce five hundred men, he found himself attacked by the Earls of Murray, Morton and Athol at the head of two thou sand men. The position where he made his last stand, was a hill, about twelve miles from the city. From this, being driven by the fire of the arquebuses into a low marshy level, he was set upon by the spearmen of Murray, and completely defeated, him self slain, whether by the sword, or suffocation from the weight of his armour, was uncertain, his two sons made prisoners, and the rest of his company either killed, dispersed, or taken,1 Sir John Gordon, the second son, who was reported to have been the chief contriver of this rebellion, and whose ambition aspired to the hand of the Queen, was immediately executed ; and the body of Huntly, according to a savage feudal practice, after having been embowelled, was kept unburied till Parliament 1 MS.

His third son, Adam Gordon, a youth of eighteen, received a pardon ; but the eldest, Lord Gordon, was found guilty of treason and impri soned ; \u2014 the immense estates of the family were seized by the crown, the title forfeited, and this all potent house reduced in a moment to insignificance and beggary. Some authors, guided by their prejudices, rather than their research, have imagined that the fate of this great baron may be traced to a premeditated conspiracy of Murray, who carried the Queen north, and prevailed on her to provoke Huntly into rebel lion by her suspicions and neglect. This is mere con jecture : it is certain that the northern progress was planned by the Queen herself, and that her council, of whom Murray was the chief, so far from exciting Mary against Huntly, urged her to visit him at Strathbogy.1 Sir John Gordon confessed his treason able designs, and laid the burden of them on his father; two confidential servants of Huntly, Thomas Ker and his brother, acknowledged that their master, on three several occasions, had plotted to cut off Murray and Lethington ; and the Queen herself, in a conversation with Randolph, thanked God for having delivered her enemy into her hand. \" She declared,\" says this minister, who was an eye-witness and com panion of the northern progress, \" many a shameful 1 MS.

It is true that he availed himself of his offences to strengthen his own power, but that, prior to the rebellion, he had laid a base design to entrap him into treason, is an opinion founded on conjecture, and contradicted by fact. Mary now returned to her capital (21st Nov. 1562) and devoted herself to the cares of Government ; but the difficulties of her situation increased. War had begun (to use the words of Secretary Maitland) between the two countries of the earth which, next to her own, were most dear to her,2 France and England, being descended of the blood of both of them by her father, and one of them by her mother. France was ready to urge her by the love she bore her relatives there, by the recollections of her early education in that country, and by the ties of a common faith, not to desert her friends when her assistance might be of essential benefit. Elizabeth, on the other hand, explained by her ambassador, the causes which \u00bb MS. Letter St. P. Off, Randolph to Cecil, 23rd Oct. 1562. Ibid., same to same, 28th Oct. 1562.

The French King's subjects in Normandy, had urged her, she said, to relieve them from the unjust tyranny of the House of Guise, and as that Monarch was unable to give them assistance, she had entered into a treaty with the Prince of Conde, by which it was agreed he should receive support both in forces and money.1 When Randolph communicated this information to Mary, she did not dissemble her sorrow, nor conceal her affection for her uncles. \"This\" said she \"I must say in their defence : \u2014 I believe them to be true subjects to their Prince, and that they do no more than execute his orders ; but \" she added. \" that she was not so unreasonable as to condemn those who differed from her in opinion, still less was she in clined, on their account, to abate anything of the friendship she felt for his mistress, the Queen of England (2nd Nov. 1562). It was, in truth, scarcely possible for Elizabeth to entertain at this moment any serious fears of Mary's intrigues in France, when we find Randolph assuring Cecil, that she heard almost as seldom from that country as the King of Muscovy.2 Every thing, indeed, seemed to favour the growing strength of the party of the Congregation in Scot land : the fall of Huntly, the amity with England, the Queen's partiality to Murray, the decided favour 1 MS. St. P. Off, Sir J. Williamson's Collection, 2nd series, vol. ii. pp. 169, 179. 2 St. P. Off, MS.

It was only to be regretted that the conduct of Knox and the more violent of his brethren, occasionally excited feelings of resentment, when there was a predisposition to peace, and that his endeavours to secure the triumph of his party, (honest and disinterested as they un doubtedly were) were not always accompanied by sound discretion, or christian love. Even Randolph, their partial friend, was shocked by the manner in which the preachers prayed for the Queen. \"They pray,\" says he, in his letter to Cecil, \"that God will keep us from the bondage of strangers, and for her self, as much in effect as, that God will either turn her heart, or send her short life.'' He adds, sarcas tically, \" of what charity or spirit this proceedeth, I leave to be discussed by the great divines.\"1 Although the Queen, as we learn from Lething ton's letters, behaved towards the Reformer with much forbearance, it seems to have created no impression in her favour. As long as she retained her own faith, and permitted the celebration of mass in her private chapel, nothing could disarm his suspicions, appease his wrath, or check the personality of his attacks. His natural disposition was sarcastic, he had a strong sense of the ludicrous, and when pro voked, his invectives were so minute, coarse, and 1 MS. Letter, St. P, Off, Randolph to Cecil, 28th Feb. 1562-3."], [348, "1562. 316 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. humorous, that they alternately excited ridicule or indignation. Lethington scoffed, Morton commanded him to hold his peace, and Randolph, as we have seen, regretted that his proceedings had more zeal than charity. News having arrived about this time of the re storation of peace to France, the Queen, who took a deep interest in her uncles, was disposed to be merry ; and the Court, reflecting the countenance of the Prince, was much occupied in masques and dancing; but to the news of peace were added suspicions of an intended persecution of the Protestants, by the Guises, and Knox, grieving for his brethren, and scandalized at the prevailing gaieties, fulminated a complaint in the pulpit against the ignorance, tyranny and malevolence of Princes. His words were meant chiefly to apply to the Guises, but he was reported to have spoken irreverently of his Sovereign, and brought before her to answer for his attack. His defence, which he has himself preserved in his his tory, was calculated rather to aggravate than extenuate the provocation. \"Madam,\" said he, \" this is oftentimes the just recompense which God gives the stubborn of the world, that because they will not hear God speaking to the comfort of the penitent, and for amendment of the wicked, they are oft compelled to hear the false report of others, to their great displeasure.

If the reporters of my words had been honest men, they would have repeated my words, and the circum stances of the same ; but because they would have cre dit in court, and wanting virtue worthy thereof, they needs must have somewhat to please your Majesty, if it were but flatteries and lies; but such pleasure, if any your Majesty take in such persons, will turn to your everlasting displeasure; for, Madam, if your own ears had heard the whole matter that I treated, if there be in you any spark of the spirit of God, yea of honesty and wisdom, you would not justly have been offended with any thing that I spake. And because you have heard their report, please your Majesty to hear myself rehearse the same, so near as memory will serve (it was even next day after that the sermon was made). My text, Madam, was this ' and now, oh Kings, understand, be learned, ye judges of the earth.' After I had declared the dignity of Kings and Rulers, the honour wherein God has placed them, the obedience that is due unto them, being God's lieuteuants, I demanded this question. But oh, alas, what account shall the most part of princes make before that supreme judge, whose throne and authority so manifestly and shamefully they abuse ? The complaint of Solomon is this day most true, that violence and oppression do occupy the throne of God here on this earth, for whilst that murderers, bloodthirsty men, oppressors and male factors dare be bold to present themselves before"], [350, "318 1562. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. kings and princes, and that the poor saints of God are banished and exiled, what shall we say, but that the devil hath taken possession in the throne of God, which ought to be a dread to all wicked doers, and a refuge to the innocent and oppressed ? And how can it be otherwise, for princes will not understand, they will not be learned as God commands them, but they despise God's law, his statutes and holy ordi nances they will not understand ? For in fiddling and flinging they are more exercised, than in reading or hearing God's most blessed word ; and fiddlers and flatterers (which commonly corrupt youth) are more precious in their eyes, than men of wisdom and gra vity, who by wholesome admonitions may beat down in them some part of that vanity and pride, wherein we are all born ; but which in princes takes deep root and strength by evil education. And of dancing, Madam, I said, that albeit in Scripture I found no praise of it, and in profane writers, that it is termed the gesture rather of those that are mad and in frenzy, than of sober men ; yet I do not utterly condemn it, providing that two vices be avoided \u2014 the former, that the principal vocation of those that use that exercise, be not neglected for the pleasure of dancing, secondly, that they dance not as the Philis tines, their fathers, for the pleasure that they take in the displeasure of God's people ; for if they do these, or either of them, they shall receive the reward of dancers, and that will be, to drink in hell, unless they repent.\" \" Your words are sharp enough even now,\" said Mary ; \" and yet, they were told me in another"], [351, "1562 319 MARY manner.

Mary, who was passionately fond of music, had shown much favour to Chartellet, a French gentleman of good family, highly skilled in that science, and in other respects, a handsome and accomplished person. Such encouragement2 from a beautiful woman, and a Queen, turned the unfortunate man's head ; he aspired to her love, and in a fit of amorous frenzy, hid himself in the royal bed-chamber, 1 Knox, pp. 334, 335. The time of this conversation between the Reformer and the Queen, is fixed by a passage in a MS. Letter from Randolph to Cecil, dated l6th Dec. 1562, St. P. Off. \"Upon Sunday last, he (Knox) inveighed sore against the Queen's dancing, and little exercise of herself in virtue and godliness. The report hereof being brought unto her ears, yesterday, she sent for him, she talked long time with him, little liking there was between them, of the one or the other, yet did they so depart, as no offence or slander did rise thereon.\" 2 Keith, p. 231."], [352, "320 1562.

The circum stance was not disclosed to the Queen till the suc ceeding morning, when with an ill-judged lenity she contented herself with commanding him to leave the Court. Desperate in his attachment, however, he secretly followed her to Burnt Island, and at night, when the Queen was stepping into bed, and none beside her but her ladies, Chartellet again started from a recess, where he had concealed himself. The shrieks of the women soon roused the Court, and when seized by those who rushed in, on hearing the uproar in the royal apartment, he audaciously ac knowledged that he had meditated an attempt on the honour of the Queen. Mary, glowing with indigna tion at the insult, commanded Murray, who first ran to her succour, to stab him with his dagger ; but he preferred securing him to this summary vengeance : a formal trial followed, and the miserable man was condemned and executed within two days after his offence.1 On the scaffold, instead of having recourse to his missal or breviary, he drew from his pocket a volume of Ronsard, and reading the poet's hymn to death, resigned himself to his fate with gaiety and in difference.2 It was a lamentable spectacle; men blamed, but at the same time pitied him ; they had not forgotten the recent flight of Captain Hepburn, who 1 MS.

The Secretary undertook the mission with reluctance,2 yet, with his usual ability, he succeeded in accomplishing the most important of his objects.

She was cast down, indeed, when she beheld the increasing difficulties which were gathering around her, and the letters of the English Minister present us with many pain ful pictures of her grief and embarrassment. Yet, when Cecil was disposed to doubt her sincerity, the same acute observer derides the vain fears of this statesman, and bears testimony to the friendly dis position of the Queen, her councillors, and her people, towards England. The two great objects which now filled Mary's mind, and employed the earnest deliberations of her Minis ters were her right of succession to the English throne, and her marriage. On both points she was anxious, as indeed, it was her interest, to consult the wishes of Elizabeth.2 She had now remained in a widowed state for three years : she was convinced that a speedy mariage was the best measure for herself and her kingdom ; her opinion was fortified by that of Murray and Lethington, and her hand had been already sought by the King of Sweden, the infant of Spain, and the Archduke Charles, second son of the Emperor ; yet Elizabeth, although ever ready to 1 MS.

It was evident it could not long suit the dignity of an independent Princess to listen to in genious objections, and repress every royal suitor in submission to the wishes of a sister Queen. About this time, a report having reached the Eng lish Court, that the successful candidate was one of the Emperor's lineage, Cecil wrote in much alarm to Murray, who replied with firmness, and good sense, that nothing serious had been yet concluded. But he added, that neither was it for her honour, nor could he advise her, to repress the suit of Princes, however deeply interested in the conti nuance of the friendship between the two Queens, and the mutual love and quietness of their subjects.1 Mary's difficulties, however, arose not merely from the interference and jealousy of the English Queen, and the mysterious diplomacy of Cecil. The violence of the party which was headed by Knox and the refoimed preachers, occasioned her infinite dis quiet, and was at length carried to such a height as to occasion a schism amongst the Protestants them selves. We have seen that this party disapproved en tirely of the lenity with which Mary had been per mitted the private exercise of her relio-fon.

In this view, some whispers which began to float about, regarding the marriao-e of Mary to a noble person recommended by Elizabeth, and as a basis of this union, the restoration of com plete amity between the two Queens, gave them no little alarm. They knew the aversion of the English Queen, as well as of Mary, to the form of worship which they believed the only system founded on Scripture, and it was really more tolerable for them to see their royal mistress a confirmed Papist and the enemy of England, than the friend and (as had been anticipated, more than once by Randolph and Le thington) the convert of Elizabeth, to the Church of England. To excite suspicions and interrupt the good under standing between the two Queens, became, therefore, a favourite object with Knox, and the more violent of the Reformers. They did not hesitate to blame Murray and Lethington for their anxiety to accom plish an interview, and traversed their praise worthy efforts, by representing- all the friendship professed by Mary, as hollow and insidious. And yet, even from Knox himself, we learn some facts, which might have convinced him of the con trary. During the absence of Lethington in England, the Papists encouraged by the Bishop of St. Andrew's, and the Prior of Whithorn, had disregarded the Queen's proclamation. Mass was celebrated secretly"], [358, "1563. 326 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. in many private houses, and when this was sound dangerous, the votaries of the Romish faith fled into the woods and mountains, where amidst their silent solitudes, they adhered to the worship of their fathers.1 Upon this, the Presbyterians, despairing, as they alleged, of any redress of such abuse, from the Queen, took the law into their own hands, pursued and seized some Priests and sent word to the Romish Clergy, that henceforth they would neither complain to the Queen or Council, but with their own hands, execute upon Idolaters, the punishment contained in God's word.2 Mary, justly alarmed at this, called for Knox, and remonstrated in earnest terms. She recommended toleration, and ar- gued with him upon the cruelty of religious perse- cution. The Reformer pleaded the laws in force against Idolatry ; these, he said, it was the duty of princes to execute. ; if they failed so to do, others must do it for them ; nor would God be offended if men, who feared Him, albeit, neither Kings nor magis trates, took it upon them to inflict judgment. \" Sam uel,\" said he, \" spared not to slay A gag, the fat and delicate King of Amalek, whom Saul had saved, nor did Elias spare Jezabel's prophets, and Baal's Priests, although King Achab stood by.

You crave of them service \u2014 they demand of you protection and defence against wicked doers.\" ' This bold exposition produced a favourable effect, Mary, for the moment, seemed offended, but soon after she sent for Knox, who met her next day as she pursued her pastime of hawking. Their in terview was amicable \u2014 almost confidential. The Queen alluding* to the intended election of a super intendant for Dumfries and the adjacent country, warned the Reformer against the Bishop of Caith ness, who was a candidate for that preferment, and she informed him with great frankness, that his rea soning* of yesterday had convinced her, that the offenders should be summoned, and justice duly administered.2 Nor was this promise forgotten. On the 19th of May, a few days before the meeting* of Parliament, the Bishop of St. Andrew's, the Prior of Whithorn, the Parson of Sanquhar, and other Papists, were arraigned before Argile, the Justice General, for the crime of celebrating mass; and, having pleaded 1 Knox, p. 353.

Mary, surrounded by a brilliant cavalcade, rode in procession to the Tolbooth, where the Estates assembled ; the hall was crowded, not only by the members, but glittered with the splendid dresses of the royal household and the ladies of the court, who surrounded the throne and filled the galleries. The extreme beauty of the Queen, and the grace with which she delivered the address, in which she opened the proceedings, surprised and delighted her people ; many exclaimed, \" May God save that sweet face ! she speaks as properly as the best orator among them !'' s Amidst this general enthusiasm, the preachers took great offence at the liberty of the French manners, and the extravagance of the foreign dresses. \" They spake boldly,\" says Knox, \" against the superflu ities of their clothes, and affirmed, that the vengeance of God would fall, not only on the foolish women, but on the whole realm. To check the growing licen tiousness, an attempt was made to introduce a sump tuary law ; articles against apparel were drawn up, and it was proposed to take order with other abuses ; but, to the extreme mortification of the Reformer, he \u00bb Knox, p. 356.\u2014 Keith, p. 239- MS.

This powerful minister, deemed it impolitic at this moment to introduce these enact ments. \" The Queen,\" he said, \" had kept her pro mises, the religion was established, the mass-mon gers were punished, if they carried things too high, she would hold no Parliament at all.\" Knox smiled significantly \u2014 Mar, he hinted, trembled for his new Earldom of Murray, and all must be postponed to have his grant confirmed, lest Mary should repent of her munificence; he denounced in strong terms, such selfish motives, reminded him of his solemn engagements to the Church, and accused him of sacrificing truth to convenience, and the service of his God to the interests of his ambition.\" The proud spirit of Murray could not brook such an attack, and he replied with asperity ; the two friends parted in anger, and the Reformer increased the es trangement by addressing a letter in which, in his usual plain and vehement style of reproof, he exonerated himself of all further care in his lordship's affairs, com mittinghimto the guidance of his own understanding, whose dictates he preferred to the advancement of the truth. \" I praise my God,\" said he, \" I leave you victor over your enemies, promoted to great honour, and in authority with your Sovereign.

He had been with them, he declared, in their most desperate temptations ; he was now with them in the days of their success and forgetfulness, and it was some relief to pour forth the sorrows of his heart, to remind them of the perils they had sur- vived \u2014 to warn them of the duties they had neglected. \" I see\" said he, getting animated in his subject, and suddenly stretching out his arms, as if he would leap from the pulpit and arrest the vision passing before him,2 \" I see before me the beleaguered camp at St. Johnston.

And what is fallen in vain of all that God ever promised you by my mouth. Speak, I say, for ye yourselves live to testify.

As soon as he could be heard, Knox attempted to defend himself, affirming, that in the pulpit, he was not master of himself, but must obey His commands who had bade him speak plain, and flatter no flesh ; as for the favours which had been offered to him, his vocation, he said, was neither to wait in the courts of princes, nor in the chambers of ladies, but to preach the gospel.\" \" I grant it so,\" reiterated the Queen, \" but what have you to do with my marriage, or, what are you within the commonwealth ?\" \" A subject born within the same,\" said the Reformer, \" and albeit, Madam, neither Baron, Lord, nor belted Earl, yet hath God made me, how abject soever in your eyes, a useful and profitable member. As such, it is my duty, as much as that of any one of the nobility, to fore warn the people of danger, and, therefore, what I have said in public, I here repeat to your own face.

In obeying this, a scene occurred which was strikingly characteristic. The Reformer passing into the outer chamber found himself shunned and avoided by the nobles of the court, who looked strangely on him, as if they had never known him before. His temper was not however of the kind to be cast down by the desertion of these summer friends, and observing a circle of the ladies of the Queen's household sitting near, in their gorgeous apparel, he could not depart without a word of admonition. \" Ah, fair ladies,\" said he, between jest and earnest, \"how pleasant were this life of yours, if it should ever abide, and then in the end we might pass to heaven with this gear ! But fie on that knave, Death \u2014 that will come whether ye will or not, and when he hath laid on the arrest, then foul worms will be busy with this flesh, be it never so fair and tender, and the silly soul, I fear, shall be so feeble, that it can neither carry with it, gold, garnishing, targating, pearl, nor precious stones.\" 2 In the midst of these speeches, the Laird 1 This must have been in May, 1563.

When Lethington returned from his prolonged embassy to England and France, he expressed much indignation against the violence of Knox and his party ; he affirmed that the reports which they had raised, regarding a match with Spain, tended directly to excite the jealousy* of Elizabeth, and to create unworthy suspicions between the Scottish Queen and her Protestant subjects. To discredit the Reformer, who had already quarrelled with Murray, became his great object, and this added bitterness to the schism which divided the more moderate, from the more violent, of the Protes tants. We cannot wonder, indeed, that the fear less and declared opposition of this extraordinary man, who possessed great power, not only over his own friends, but over the people, provoked and thwarted so refined and crafty a politician as Le thington ; and as Knox corresponded with Cecil, and was indefatigable in procuring secret information both from England and the continent, the secretary found him no easy enemy to deal with. Not long after the return of Lethington, and when every proceeding on the part of Mary and her ministers was dictated by an anxious desire to conci liate Elizabeth, the Reformer, instead of seconding these efforts, addressed to Cecil a letter full of suspicion and alarm. He assured him that out of"], [367, "1563 335 MARY the twelve who formed the Queen's Council, nine had been gained over to that, which, in the end, would prove their destruction.1 Every thing, he added, depended on the firmness of Murray ; if he failed, or faltered, all was lost. As for himself, he declared, he was prepared for the worst, and had little to fear on his own account, but it was lamentable to see the dark cloud of calamities, which were preparing to burst upon his country, and all because men must follow the inordinate affections of her, who was born to be the plague of her realm. The key to part of this despondency is to be found in a sentence of the same letter, which alluding* to a late progress of the Queen, informed Cecil, that \"the conveying of the mass through these quarters, which longest had been best reformed, had dejected the hearts of many and caused him to disclose the plainness of a troubled heart.2 Yet, although, probably he was over ex cited, and too much alarmed, it is certain that Knox had good ground to believe that intrigues for the marriage of the Queen with some foreign potentate of her own religion, were then secretly agitated both in Scotland and on the continent. It was probably her conviction of the truth of this, which at the last drove Elizabeth from all her delays and excuses, and compelled her to point out plainly to Mary, some prince or noble person, whom she judged worthy of her hand. To the astonish ment of her council, she proposed her favourite 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off. Knox to Cecil, 5th Oct. 1563. Ibid. MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Knox to Cecil, 5th Oct. 1563."], [368, "336 1564.

As however, he was not yet authorized to give the name,1 these wary ministers, although they saw to whom he pointed hesitated to meddle in so delicate a matter. They suspected, and not without good ground, the sincerity of the English Queen, and hinted, that considering the affection which bound her to Dudley, and him to his royal mistress, it could not be believed that she would part with her lover, or he be so base as to for sake her, even for a crown.2 Randolph's perplexity in conducting these nice and difficult negotiations, was strongly expressed in a letter, which at this time he addressed to Cecil. \" To persuade the Queen of Scotland,\" he observed, \"to marry any man under the rank of a prince, would be a dangerous and dis honourable task for any subject toadventure, and even, if Mary was ready to forget her royal dignity, and listen for a moment to the proposal of Elizabeth, there remained, he said, a greater difficulty behind. In offering the noblest in England, none could be at a loss to divine who was meant. But how unwil ling (he continued) the Queen's Majesty herself would be to depart from him, and how hardly his 1 MS. Letter, St. P.

Wherefore, this they (he alludes to Murray and Lethington) conclude, as well for her Majesty's part, as for him who is so happy to be so far in her Grace's favour, that if this Queen would wholly put herself into Elizabeth's will, as to receive a husband of her selecting,\" either she should not have the best, or at least match herself with him, that hath his mind placed already elsewhere, or if it can be withdrawn from thence, she shall take a man, un worthy from his disloyalty and inconstancy to marry with any, much less with a Queen.

She complained that, after long delay, he was now needlessly precipitate, and had taken her by surprise. She looked, she said, to have heard of peace between France and England, and of no such difficult matter as he had abruptly introduced. The English minister urged the necessity of a speedy decision on so important a point as her marriage, and the fair and honourable offer which was now made her. \"Your own mistress,\" replied Mary, \" has been somewhat longer of deciding than I have been, and you know she hath counselled me to have regard to three points, whereof the special one was honour. Now, think you, Master Randolph, that it will be honourable in me to imbase my state, and marry one of her subjects. Is this conformable to her promise to use me as her sister or daughter, to advise me to marry my Lord Robert ; to ally myself with her own subject ?'n To this Randolph, waving the point most difficult to answer, urged the advantage which might result to the tranquillity and happiness of both kingdoms, and intimated that the Queen of England, by the honour and preferments with which she intended to endow Dudley, would render him not unworthy of so exalted an alliance. Mary perceived he wished her to believe that his mistress might acknowledge her right of succession, and settle the kingdom upon 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, 30th March, 1563-4.

What if the Queen, your mistress, should marry herself, and have children ? What have I then gotten ; who will say I have acted wisely to take this step, which requires long consideration, on so sudden a proposal as this ? I have conferred with no one, and although willing not to mistrust your mistress, the adventure is too great.\" In reply, Randolph begged the Queen to speak on the subject to Murray, Lethington, and Argile. She agreed ; and communicated Elizabeth's proposal to them the same day after supper; but Lethington informed the English envoy, that although his mistress was pleased that, after so much obscure dealing, the Queen of England at last began to speak plainly, she deemed it prudent, when all was yet so vague, to give no more definite answer than that sent to her last letter.1 If the English Queen had been sincere in this proposal ; had she consented, as the basis of Mary's marriage with Dudley, to acknowledge her right of succession, and agreed to confirm it by an act of the legislature, settling* the Crown upon their children, Murray and Lethington were ready to use all their influence to promote the union, and it is very proba ble that the Scottish Queen would have embraced the offer.2 Upon no other supposition can we account for her conduct during this trying and tantalizing 1 MS.

She exhibited no indignation when the overture was first made by Randolph ; she bore every delay with patience, and evinced every disposition to oblige Elizabeth. At her request and earnest recommendation, the Earl of Lennox, who had for many years been banished from Scotland, and whose proceedings against his native country had been hostile and treasonable, obtained permission to return, and was allowed to hope that his royal mistress would receive him with favour. For some time nothing had been said of the intended interview between the two Queens, and it had broken off on the part of Elizabeth ; but when this Princess now suddenly renewed her proposal for a meeting, although Mary's ministers, aware that it was merely a colour for delay, declined the overture, the Scottish Queen herself was grieved that they did so, and earnestly desired it.2 On her part, therefore, and in the conduct of Murray and Lethington, everything at this moment was open and friendly. On the side of Elizabeth and Cecil, on the other hand, there had been pursued, for the last three years, such a complicated system of delay, mystery, and caprice, as to create a suspicion in the minds of the Scottish ministers that the Eng lish Queen was really hostile to the marriage, that she 1 MS.

Gentle letters, good words, and plea sant messages be good means to begin friendship amongst princes ; but I take them to be too slender bands to hold it fast.\"1 He then adds a remark which is strikingly descriptive of Cecil's mysterious diplo macy. \" In these great causes between our Sove reigns, I have ever found that fault with you, that as m your letters you always wrote obscurely, so in private communications you seldom uttered your own judgment. You might well academico more dispute in utramque partem, leaving me in suspense to collect what I would.

Marry, I fear the common affairs do not fare a whit the better for our too great wariness.\"1 Elizabeth was at last driven by the conduct of Mary and her ministers, to that perplexity which is the general fate of duplicity when opposed to plain and direct dealing. As a last pretext for delay, she availed herself of some secret information transmitted by Knox to Randolph, regarding the alleged in trigues of Lennox in Scotland. This highly-allied noble had, as we have seen, obtained permission to return to that country a short time before this,3 and at the earnest entreaty of Elizabeth, Mary promised to lend a favourable ear to his suits. Strictly speaking, Lennox was still an outlaw, for the sentence of his forfeiture could only be removed by an act of the legislature ; yet the entreaty of the English Queen, the recommendation of Cecil, and the powerful interest of Murray and the secretary Lethington, were successfully exerted 1 MS.

Randolph also had instructions from Elizabeth to promote his views ; and when about to leave the English Court, he not only received Mary's permission, under her great seal, to re- visit his native country, but was flattered with the hope that his for feiture would be removed, and himself replaced in the high station which belonged to his birth. This anticipated restoration caused immediate alarm to Knox and his party. It was more than suspected that both Lennox and his son were Papists ; and the Reformer, in a gloomy letter to Randolph, strongly deprecated their return.1 His fears were instantly communicated to Elizabeth, and this Princess, who was watching for a pretext to delay any negotiation on the subject of the marriage with Dudley, eagerly availed herself of this circumstance to commence afresh system of duplicity and delay. She instantly took steps to detain the Earl in England ; and, although it was to gratify her own wishes, most earnestly expressed to Lethington that Mary had con sented to receive him into favour ; yet, with extraordi nary inconsistency, she now commanded Cecil to ad dress letters to Murray and Lethington, requiring them to persuade the Scottish Queen to revoke her promise, and countermand his return into her kingdom. These able men, however, at once detected her object, and met her with a peremptory refusal. The correspond ence which passed upon the subject is extremely 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, 3rd, 1564.

That Elizabeth should now oppose it, was \" not a little marvellous,\" he observed, \" seeing how earnestly her Majesty did recommend unto me my Lord of Lennox's cause and my Lady's, at my last being in 1 Elizabeth's Instructions to Randolph, 4th October, 1564.

It will neither be he, nor I, praised be God, can hinder or alter religion hereaway, and his coming or remaining in that cause will be to small purpose.\"3 The English Queen had addressed to Mary a letter at the same time, and to the same effect ; but she replied with so much spirit, and used so little care to conceal her opinion of such inconsistent conduct, that Eliza beth was deeply offended.4 Thus foiled in this secret intrigue against Lennox, Elizabeth withdrew her opposition.

The Earl received her license to leave England, and on the 23rd of September, he arrived in Edinburgh, bringing with him a strong letter of re commendation from the English Queen,1 which Mary, who knew her real sentiments, must have read with no very favourable opinion of her sincerity. This princess was then absent, on a northern progress, but she returned before the end of the month, and Len nox, having been invited by his royal mistress to pre sent himself at Court, obeyed her injunction with much state and ceremony. He rode to the palace of Holy rood, having twelve gentlemen before him, splendidly mounted and clothed in black velvet; behind him came a troop of thirty attendants bearing his arms and livery : having dismounted, the Queen instantly sent for him, and their interview which took place in the presence of the nobility was flattering* and cor dial.2 Mary immediately communicated these parti culars to Elizabeth, informing her, that from her anxiety to show deference to her request, she had not only already given the Earl some proof of her goodwill, but meant also to \" proceed further to his full restitution, whereby he should be able to enjoy the privileges of a subject, the liberty of his native to her highness, but I was answered, that the letter was burnt at her own request. * * I have, according to your desire, returned unto you, your own letter.\" 1 Keith, p. 254. 2 Diurnal of Occurrents in Scotland, p. 77-"], [380, "1564. 348 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. country, and his old titles.1'' Soon after, the restored Lord invited Randolph to dinner, and the ambassa dor wrote to Cecil an account of the entertainment which proves, that the Scottish Queen had been as good as her word. \" I dined with my Lord of Len nox,\" said he, \" being by him required in the morn ing. I found nothing less for the beautifying and furniture of his lodging than your honour hath heard by report ; the house well hanged, two chambers, very well furnished, one special rich and fair bed, where his lordship lieth himself, and a passage made through the wall to come the next way into court when he will. I see him honourably used of all men, and that the Queen's self hath good liking of his behaviour. There dined with him the Earl of Athol, in whom he reposes singular trust, and they are sel dom asunder, saving when the Earl of Lennox is at the sermon (Athol was a Roman Catholic).

We learn this from the following re markable letter written in her own hand to Cecil. This Minister, her director in every difficulty, was then confined to his chamber by sickness, and the Queen, snatching a sheet of paper, wrote to him these few lines in latin. \" In ejusmodi laberintho posita sum de responso meo reddendo R.

There is, we see, no accusation of the policy of Mary, or her Minis ters, Murray and Lethington. Their open dealingupon the two great points of the marriage and the suc cession, is virtually admitted. She complains, that it had at last reduced her to a dilemma in which she knew not what to do or what to say, and throws upon Cecil the burden of finding, or inventing some plau sible apology which she may transmit by Randolph, then about to leave the English Court for Scotland. In the mean time the Scottish Queen despatched Sir James Melvil, whom she had lately re-called from France, on a mission to Elizabeth. Melvil was an accomplished gentleman who had been educated in the Household of the Constable Montmorency, he was personally acquainted with most of the leading men in France and Germany, and being a Protestant, Mary believed he would be acceptable to her sister, and might do much to remove any unpleasant feelings 1 ' I am involved in such a labyrinth, regarding the reply to the letter of the Queen of Scots, that I know not how I can satisfy her, having delayed all this time sending her any answer and now really being at a total loss what I must say.

He was instructed to insinuate himself as much as possible into the confi dence of the English Queen, to mingle merry dis courses with business, and gain her familiar ear \u2014 to discover, if possible, her real intention and wishes on the subject of the marriage, and to keep a strict and jealous eye upon any measures which might be con templated, regarding Mary's right of succession to the English Crown.1 On both points, he conducted the negotiation with success, and the account of it which he has left in his memoirs, presents us with the best portrait of Elizabeth, \" as a woman \" that has ever been given. The English Queen was much pleased with his lively and elegant manners, with his fund of court anecdotes, and the tone of gallantry and devo tion with which he addressed her. She frequently sent for him three times a day, questioned him upon the beauty of his royal mistress, as compared with her own, insisted on knowing which of them he found fairest, which the best shaped, and whether he liked her most when habited in the English, French, or Italian costume. On one occasion, taking him into her bed chamber, and opening an escritoire, she showed him some small miniatures, wrapped up in paper, upon which the Queen had written their names in her own hand. Taking one from among these, she kissed it and held it to Melvil. It was the picture of his royal mistress, and the gallant envoy 1 Melvil's Memoirs, Bann.

The ceremony took place at Westminster, \" herself/' says Melvil, \" helping to put on his ceremonial, he sitting on his knees before her, keeping a great gravity and discreet behaviour, but she could not refrain from putting her hand in his neck to kittle (tickle) him, smilingly \u2014 the French Ambassador and I standing beside her.

My answer again was, \" that no woman of spirit would make choice of such a man, who was more like a woman than a man, for he was very lusty, beardless and lady-faced.\" In this last sarcasm on Darnley 's feminine appear ance, the Ambassador had an end in view. Mary had given him a secret commission to deal with Lady Lennox, that her son should pass into Scotland to see the country and visit his father, and he was anxious that Elizabeth should have no suspicion of any such overture on the part of the Scottish Queen.' During the nine days that he remained at the English Court, Melvil continued to be treated with much confidence and familiarity. Elizabeth assured him that the subject of Mary's right to the succession of the Crown of England, should be treated of in an approaching meeting of Commissioners from both countries, and declared her anxiety to declare her the second person in the realm, provided she listened to her advice on the subject of her marriage. She added, \" that it was her own resolution at this mo ment to remain till her death a virgin Queen, and that nothing would compel her to change her mind, except the undutiful behaviour of the Queen, her sister.\" Melvil smiled incredulously, and shook his head, observing, \" that he knew she would never marry, because let Mary do what she would, the 1 Melvil's Memoirs, Bann.

Lord Hunsdon after dinner drew him aside to a quiet gallery, where he might hear some music, laying his finger on his mouth, and whispering that Elizabeth was playing on the virginals. The corridor was separated from the royal chamber only by a curtain, behind which Melvil listened for a while, then drawing it softly aside, and perceiving that her Majesty's back was towards him, he slipt into the chamber, and heard her execute a piece admirably well. The Queen, however, suddenly turned round, and running forward, as if ashamed, threatened to strike him with her 1 Melvil's Memoirs, p. 122."], [387, "1564 MARY 355 left hand. \" She was not used,\" she said, \" to play before men,\" and asked him, \" how he came there.\" The Ambassador did not find it difficult to appease the royal anger. \" He was walking in the gallery,\" he said, \" with Lord Hunsdon, when his ear was ra vished with her melody, which drew him into the chamber he could scarcely tell how ; he implored her pardon, but he had been brought up in a foreign court, where the manners were less grave than in Eno-land and was ready to bear any punishment her Highness chose to inflict.\" Elizabeth was much pleased, she sat down on a cushion, and when Melvil knelt beside her, asked him, whether she or Mary played best. He gave her the delight of hearing, that in music she excelled Mary, and she declared she would not let him away till he had seen her dance.1 On his return to Scotland the Ambassador informed his mistress of Elizabeth's strong protestations of friendship and attachment, but being pressed by the Scottish Queen to give his opinion of her sincerity, declared his conviction that she had little upright meaning\"; on the contrary, he had detected, he said, much dissimulation and jealousy, she had already hindered her marriage with the Archduke Charles, and she now offered Leicester, who was the last man she would part with.2 In the meantime Randolph, who for a considerable period had been resident at the English Court was despatched into Scotland with instructions to renew the proposals 1 Melvil's Memoirs, p. 125. 2 Ibid. p. 129, 2 A 2"], [388, "1564, 356 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. regarding Leicester, but his promises were so vague, and his answers when pressed by Murray and Le thington, so obscure, evasive, and dilatory, that these Ministers could arrive at no definite con clusion,1 and dreaded to commit themselves. A secret meeting was held between them, and the Earl of Bedford, at Berwick, but it led to no more satis factory result.2 Repeated conferences then took place with Randolph. This crafty and discerning envoy assured Cecil and his royal mistress, that although Mary was worn out with delays, pressed by foreign suitors, and agitated by idle and malicious rumours arising from her remaining unmarried, still she con tinued to be animated by the same friendly feelings towards Elizabeth, she spoke of her with affection and respect, and seemed inclined to think her sincere regarding the marriage with Dudley.3 Her ministers assured him, that if his royal mistress would perform their sole and simple request if she would procure it to be declared by Act of Parliament, that Mary was next to herself in succession to the English Crown, they would undertake to overthrow all foreign prac tices for her marriage, and accomplish the union with Leicester.4 That nobleman had in the meantime 1 MS.

On the 14th Dec. Randolph again wrote to Cecil ; he referred to the letter lately addressed to this minister by Maitland and Murray, and he then observed. \" The stay now standeth either in the Queen's Majesty to have all this performed, or in his Lordship's self, (Leicester) that hath the matter so well framed to his hand, that much more, I believe, there need not be than his own consent with that which may be for the Queen's Majesty's honour to do for him.

Truth it is, that in another point you have more advantage, in that you have a sufficient warrant for what you write, and so work surely, writing nothing but that your mistress both knoweth and doth allow ; and we, without any commandment or warrant, write such things as, being brought to light, were sufficient matter to overthrow our credit at our Sovereign's hand, and put all we have in danger.

His forfeiture was reversed, his estates and honours re stored, whilst the Queen, to give the greater solemnity to this act of favour, came herself to the House, and 1 MS. Letter, St. P.

To be present at its cele bration was made punishable by the loss of lands, goods, and even life, if the Prince should think fit ; nor were any exempted from the full penalties of the Statute, except the Queen and her household. This confirmation of a severe and unjust law might at least have convinced the more rigid Protestants that Mary remained true to the promise she had made on her first arrival, whilst her continued favour to Murray, and the Parliamentary sanction given to the late grant of his new Earldom, manifested the sincerity of her dealing towards him to whom she committed the chief management of her affairs. Shortly after this, the great affair of the marriage with Leicester seemed, from what cause is not easily discoverable, to assume a more decided form.

Atfirst, indeed, she play- fully refused to listen to any introduction of grave and weighty matters ; it was, she said, her holiday time ; she had thrown aside her pomp, and lived with a small train in a merchant's house at St. Andrew's, intent on nothing but to be quiet and happy. Ran- dolph, however, was not to be thus put aside. He dined and supped with her every day, and at last ventured to speak of business. \" I had no sooner spoken the word,\" says he, \" but the Queen said,\" \" I see now well that you are weary of this com- pany and treatment.

After dinner she rode abroad, and it pleased her most part of the time to talk with him. As the Queen's conversation at this ride was important, it is perhaps best to give it in her own words, as they were instantly afterwards re ported to Cecil by Randolph himself. \" She had occasion,\" says the Ambassador \" to speak much of France for the honour she received there to be the wife unto a great King, and for the friendship showed unto her in particular by many, for which occasions she was bound to love the nation, to show them pleasure, and do them good.

His avowed errand was to visit his father, and assist him in some private affairs which required the personal presence of the heir of his house;1 but there is no doubt that other and deeper schemes hung upon this journey. The Countess of Lennox, his mother, an ambitious and intriguing woman, looked forward to his ingratiating himself with Mary ; and Elizabeth, who dreaded lest her simulated offer of Leicester should involve her in difficulties, and compel her to part with her favourite, was nowise averse to make the Scottish Queen acquainted with this young Prince, who, next to herself, was the nearest heir to the English throne. He was received with much distinction by the Earl of Bedford, and having passed a night at Ledington, the seat of Secretary Maitland, arrived at Edinburgh (12th Feb., 1564-5).2 Having learnt that the Queen was absent in Fife, he passed over the Firth, and was introduced to Mary at the castle of the Wemyss, where during a short progress she then resided. His reception was flatter ing ; and his manners and address created a prepos session in his favour, not only amongst the Scottish courtiers, but in the more severe and sarcastic mind of Randolph, the English ambassador. As he was aware that his sudden appearance in Scotland must draw the eyes of many upon him, it was his object to 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Lennox to Cecil. 10th March, 1564-5. 2 MS. Letter, St. P.

It was suspected that both his father and himself were Papists ; but the young Lord put himself under the guidance of Murray, and went to hear Knox preach. After the sermon they re turned to the palace ; he was introduced to the beauties of the Court, and in the evening, at the suggestion of Murray, Darnley danced a galliard with the Queen.1 But although whispers began to circulate regarding the motives which had brought him to Scotland, there can be no doubt that Mary and her Ministers were still intent upon the matrimonial negotiation with England. At this moment she treated with great coldness the overtures of her uncle, the Cardinal of Lorraine, who proposed to procure a Papal dispensa tion for her marriage with the King of France.2 It was even surmised that she was becoming more open to conviction on the subject of religion ; and Ran dolph playfully accused her of beginning to savour of the Huguenots, requesting her to take counsel of his Sovereign. \" This must be,\" said Mary, when I come to England ;'' alluding to their long-intended interview. The ambassador asked when that would be. \" Whenever your mistress wishes it,\" was the answer; \" and as to marriage, my husband must be such a one as she will give me.''

If this took place, he was content, he said, to lose (as he must do) much of his power and honour, for the satisfaction of having discharged his duty ; but if he failed in this, it was almost certain ruin. The Queen would dislike and suspect him, because he had deceived her with promises which he could not realize ; he was the counsellor and deviser of that line of policy which, for the last five years, had been pursued towards England ; he it was, that had induced her to defer to Elizabeth, to desert her ancient friends, to renounce every foreign offer. \" If,\" said he, \" she marry any other than Leicester, what mind will the new king bear me, that knoweth I have so strongly opposed his advancement. If he be a Papist, either we must obey, or fall into new misery and difficulty, whilst I shall be regarded as the ringleader of the discontented.

Elizabeth had described the Scottish Ministers, as transforming the negotiation too much into a matter of bargain ; \" they looked,\" she said, \" for her death, and hunted after a kingdom ;\" whilst she jocularly told Melvil, that Maitland, in his constant allusions to the succession, was, like a death-watch, ever ringing her knell in her ears. The Secretary ably repelled this unworthy notion. \" In good faith,\" said he, \" that is not my mistress's meaning.

Such a stroke of policy, he remarked, would secure for them a more 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, 4th March, 1564-5, Randolph to Cecil.

It became at last necessary for Elizabeth to come to a decision ; and Randolph was instructed to impart to the Scottish Queen her final resolution. It amounted to a peremptory and mortifying denial of every proposal of her Ministers. She refused to recognise Mary's title, or to adopt any measures regarding her right of succession, till she had made up her own mind whether she should marry or not.2 If Mary chose to accept Leicester as a simple Earl, and trust to the after munificence of the English Queen, she would not have any reason to repent her confidence ; but this was the same vague and delusive expectation so long held out, which seemed to promise all, and actually meant nothing. The message of Elizabeth, in short, at once put an end to all negotiation. When Randolph communicated her letter to the Scottish Queen, it was evident to him. that she was deeply moved, and he heard afterwards that their interview had been followed by a passionate fit of weeping.3 Lethington at once declared, that after 1 MS.

His know ledge of the character of his royal mistress led him to this conclusion. It was Mary's weakness to be hurried away by the predominating influence of some one feeling and object. Warm, generous, and con fiding, but, at the same time, ambitious and tenacious of her rights, it had been her favourite and engrossing object for the last four years, to prevail upon Eliza beth to recognise her title to the English throne. With this view she had given credit to her professions, borne every delay with patience, checked the advances of foreign suitors, treated her nearest relatives with coldness, and promoted to the highest offices of wealth and power, those of her nobles who were most attached to England. Everything had been sacrificed to an imprudent dependence upon the promises of Elizabeth. Almost to the very last she hoped against hope, and showed an affec tion which, to the piercing and suspicious eyes of Randolph, was sincere and unequalled.1 Are we to wonder, that when she suddenly was awakened to the duplicity with which she had been treated ; when, in a moment, the mask of pretended amity and affection, so long worn by the English Queen, fell to the ground, and the features of fraud, falsehood, and selfishness, came out in all their deformity, Mary 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, 13th March, 1564-5, Randolph to Cecil."], [406, "1564-5. 374 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. recoiled with mortification and disgust. Her con fidence had been abused ; she was the dupe of successful artifice ; she might soon be the victim of intrio-ues of which she knew not the ramifications and extent. Can we be surprised, that, under this state of mind, the re-action was immediate and violent. She had long submitted her opinion to others ; she now determined to choose for herself. The influence of her uncles and of the Court of Rome had been for years on the wane ; she was not indisposed now to see it revived. The Protestant nobility and the reformed clergy had been treated ever since her arrival in her dominions with high favour, and the great body of her subjects who adhered to the ancient faith, were kept under and neglected ; it was right now that the balance should be held with a more equal hand between them. Murray had been chosen by her as her chief minister and adviser since she left France ; to him she had committed almost regal powers ; she had pardoned his rebellion, had accu mulated upon him estates and honours, and placed him at the very head of her nobles ; she had com mitted herself to his guidance, it was by his advice she had shaped her policy towards England, it was the road marked out for her by him and Lethington that had led her on to mortification, insult, and defeat. Was it possible that she could continue to those two men the confidence with which she had formerly regarded them ? was it unnatural that, when she discovered their entire devotedness to Elizabeth, she should begin to consider them as"], [407, "1564-5 MARY 375 merely instruments in her hands, and regard them with suspicion and resentment? Yet, although these feelings must at this moment have influenced her secret resolutions, it was the unhappiness of Mary to be surrounded by those whom she could not trust, or to whom she dared not give power. Had she selected as her counsellors any of the wisest amongst the Romish clergy, the measure would have been probably met by an instantaneous rising of the people and the reformed preachers ; whilst her nobility, alike Romish and Protestant, had successively shown them selves venal, selfish, and treacherous. She was compel led, therefore, to temporise and conciliate ; and when we consider the fearful elements by which she was surrounded \u2014 craft, cruelty, fanaticism, in their worst shapes, \u2014 all the fierce and uncontrollable passions which marked a feudal age, and much of the refined vices which her subjects had imported in a lengthened and constant intercourse with France and the continent, it is difficult to withhold our pity from this still youthful Queen, placed without advisers in a situation of such peril and responsibility. It was necessary, however, to come to a determina tion. Mary had resolved already on a speedy marriage, and her mind naturally turned to Darnley. His descent was royal, his grandmother being the sister of Henry the Eighth, and his mother cousin german to Queen Elizabeth. At the installation of Lord Robert Dudley, as Earl of Leicester, the reader may remember that Sir James Melvil saw Darnley, as first prince of the blood, bear the sword"], [408, "1564-5. 376 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. of state before the Queen.1 His own title to the throne of England was second only to that of the Queen of Scotland ; he bore the royal name, and by a marriage with him, she believed that she would secure to their children an undoubted and unchallengeable title to the English Crown. He was now in his twenty-first year ;2 his conduct since his arrival in Scotland, if we may believe Randolph (a witness whose feelings against him gives weight to his praise), had been prudent and popular.3 He had come to the Scottish Court not only with the full approbation, but with the warm recommendation of Elizabeth;4 and this queen had repeatedly assured Mary, that although she decidedly opposed her marriage toa foreign prince, she might choose any of her English nobility, and be certain of her approbation. When, therefore, she selected Darnley, the Scottish Queen had reason to expect the approval of Elizabeth, and, if we except Knox and his party, the concurrence and support of all classes in the state. Nor, although Lennox and his son were both suspected of being Papists, could Mary augur that the English Queen would be much dissatisfied on that account. At this very moment, a negotiation was suspected to be carrying on for a marriage between England and 1 Supra, p. 353. 2 Keith, p. 269. 3 MS. Letter, St. P.

Elizabeth, it was reported in the Scottish Court, was every day manifesting a greater favour for Popish ceremonies ; she had determined to impose upon the English clergy a particular habit, copied from the Romish costume ; she herself had been seen to wear a rosary and a crucifix, and Bonner had affirmed with impunity, that there was not one real Bishop in England.1 All this held out encou ragement to Mary : it was soon manifest that her choice was fixed on Darnley, and in a dangerous and infectious illness which seized him about this time, she attended him in person with the utmost care, earnestness, and affection, sitting up with him till midnight, watching his convales cence, and showing delight at his recovery.2 In a sister to a favourite brother, such devotedness would have been commendable ; in a Queen to her subject, and still more in an affianced mistress to her future husband, it was undignified and indecorous, and gave a handle to the injurious construc tions of her enemies. But it was the misfortune of her ardent disposition that she was always under the domination of some strong and engrossing feeling, which sometimes led her to disregard appearances, and to believe she could never sacrifice enough for the object of her approval; nor did she think of the miserable effects of such flattery and at tention upon the youth who was exposed to it.

He became proud and over bearing ; and treating the ancient nobility with neg lect, attached himself principally to Riccio, the Queen's secretary for her French correspondence ; an Italian, who being first introduced into the royal household as a musician, had been promoted to this office, in consequence of the disgrace of Raulet, her former French secretary.1 He began also to show symptoms of a passionate and unmanageable temper, talked with great imprudence ofthe strongparty hehad in England ; 2 declared openly that Murray's power was exorbitant and dangerous, and made himself in a short time so many enemies, that it was whispered, he must soon either change his conduct, or lose his life.3 Nor were the consequences of this extraor dinary favour shown to Lennox and his son less 1 MS.

Those who knew best the disposition of the Queen began to dread that these nobles would wrest from her the whole power in the state, and that she would herself become nothing but a passive instrument in effecting their purposes of ambition and aggrandizement.

It was affirmed, that she had herself sent Darnley into Scotland, with a purpose to bring about the very events which had occurred ; that her object was to hinder any potent foreign alliance ; to match the Queen meanly, and to interrupt the friendly inter course between the two kingdoms.3 1 MS.

In the midst of these unpleasant rumours and sur mises, Mary despatched Lethington to the English Court (14th April, 1565), with injunctions to commu nicate her resolution regarding Darnley, and to use all his influence to procure the approbation of the Queen. He arrived at Westminster on the 18th of April, and, as he had anticipated, found Elizabeth not only hostile to the projected alliance, but ex pressing herself with much bitterness against the Scottish Queen. She submitted the proposal to her Privy Council. (1st May, 1565) and after long deliberations, they declared themselves unanimously opposed to it, pronouncing the measure \" prejudi cial to both the Queens, and consequently dangerous to the weal of both countries.1 What these dangers were, the councillors did not think proper to describe, nor do we learn from any contemporary letters that Lethington exerted his ingenuity to dissipate this alarm. In the meantime, during his absence, some im portant events were taking place in Scotland. Both well, the mortal enemy of Murray, returned suddenly from France, but the suspicions of treason, under which he lay, and the reports which had reached the Queen's ears, of his abandoned and profligate cha racter, induced her to treat him with the utmost severity. The Earl of Murray, whose life he had repeatedly threatened, demanded justice, and Mary summoned him to stand his trial for high treason in 1 Keith, p. 270, 274, 275. 2 MS. Letter, St. P.

He first alludes to the expected trial of Bothwell. \" Upon Tuesday, at night (the 1st of May) there came to this town my Lords of Murray and Argile, to keep the day of law against the Earl Bothwell, who ap peared not, nor is it yet for certain known what is become of him, though the common report is, that he embarked at North Berwick.

More also had come, saving that they were stayed by the Queen, who hath showed herself now of late to mislike, that my Lord of Murray so earnestly pur sueth him, (Bothwell) and will not give his advice to take the like advantage upon some others, whom she beareth small affection unto. \" In this matter thus far they have proceeded, upon Wednesday he was called, and for lack of appear ance, was condemned in the sum; farther the Queen would not that the justice clerk should proceed, which hath bred so much misliking, and given occa sion of such kind of talk against her Grace, for bearing with such men in her own cause, ' that that which is already spoken passeth all measure.\" 1 In an affair where the Crown was prosecutor.

The Queen instead of showing good will to Bothwell, was strongly prejudiced against him, and in conse quence of his coarse and violent conduct, had recently, declared, he should never receive favor at her hands.1 As to the accusation of a conspiracy, it may be remem bered, that Arran when he made the disclosure, 31st March, 1562,2 was mad, he then implicated not only Bothwell, but his own father, and had continued insane ever since. What evidence Murray had collected during the lapse of nearly three years, we cannot tell, but as this potent accuser came to attend the trial with an army of five thousand men, Bothwell justly considered that his life would be in danger if he appeared, and sent his kinsman, Hepburn, of Whit sum, to protest his innocence, and to declare his readiness to answer the charge when made quietly, without tumult or intimidation.3 The Ambassador proceeds to notice the obstinacy of the Queen, the discontent of her subjects, and the threatenings which began to circulate, \" that if good advice was despised, remedy must be sought by sharper means.\" \" This,\" he continues, \" is not the voice of one or two, they are not the mean est that spake it, nor the unlikeliest to put it in execution, if that way they go to work.

Consultation was had what order might be put unto that confusion that had grown up, wherein every man might do and say what he would without reproof against God's glory and his word. Their deliberation contained three heads. First, how to remove idolatry out of the realm, containing in that as well the Queen's chapel as others. Next, that her own laws might be put in execution without offence. The third, that liberty might be granted without inhibitionor reproof, to such as are admitted to preach the true word of God. Long reasoning hath been hereupon. It was determined that the request should be put in writing, and certain appointed as messengers for the rest.

The picture it conveys of universal discon tent, and the symptoms of rising wrath and incipient rebellion which it describes, were coloured highly to suit the purposes of this crafty minister, and to favour the views of the English faction. The Duke, Murray, and Argile, with Knox, and all, or the greater portion of the Protestants, were, no doubt, violently opposed to the marriage, and had already adopted precautions, not only for their own defence, but had begun to repeat the same game which they had already played so successfully. They had solicited Ran- \u00ab MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Randolph to Cecil, 3d May, 1565."], [421, "1565 389 MARY dolph to procure for them the support and coun tenance of the English Queen, and had declared their readiness to rise inarms against their Sovereign. All this was true ; but when this Minister asserted, that the union with Darnley was odious to the whole nation, when he represented the Queen as having fallen into universal contempt, and when he described the lives of the Protestant preachers as being in danger, from the measures adopted against them, he stated what was contradicted by subsequent events, and even disproved by his own letters. It was soon seen, that Mary, if she had some enemies, had also many powerful friends. Besides Lennox and his son now restored to their estates, and with their lands, to great feudal strength, she could reckon firmly on the support of the Earls of Athole and Caithness, the Lords Hume and Ruthven, with the Lord Robert, and all the ancient Barons and families who were still secretly attached to the Romish religion.1 It was surmksed, also, that Lethington, whose coun sel and experience were of such value to any party which he cordially embraced, would be unwil ling to declare openly against her ; and the mind of the Queen herself, far from being overwhelmed by the difficulties which surrounded her, seemed to gain energy by the struggle, and led her to act with a promptitude, spirit, and vigor, for which her oppo nents were not prepared. Before, however, she proceeded to more decisive 1 Keith, p. 272."], [422, "1565. 390 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. measures, she resolved to make a last attempt to gain Murray, and obtain his consent to her marriage with Darnley. He was flattered and caressed, both by the Queen and the Earl of Lennox, but to little effect. Mary then seizing a moment when he was off his guard, and in Lord Darnley 's chamber, took him aside and placed a paper in his hands, to which she required him to put his name. It contained an approval of her marriage, and an engagement to promote it with his whole power, and this she insisted he should consent to, as he would show himself her faithful subject, and avoid her displeasure. Murray firmly, but re spectfully, declined. \" Her resolution,\" he said, \" was overhasty, and her demand upon him too sud den and peremptory. What would foreign princes think of such precipitation ? What must be the opinion of the Queen of England, with whom her Ambassador was even then in treaty, and whose answer she daily expected? But most of all,\" he said, \" he would be loath to consent to the marriage of any one, of whom there was so little hope that he would be a favourer of Christ's true religion, which O rf was the thing most to be desired ; of one who hitherto had shown himself rather an enemy than a preserver of the same.\" 1 Indignant and surprised, at this refusal, Mary remonstrated, entreated, and even threatened. But all was to no purpose. To her \" many sore words,\" he replied with great calmness and humility, yet he continued firm in his reso- 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Office, Randolph to Cecil, 8th May, 1565."], [423, "1565. MARY. 391 lution, and was dismissed from the presence of his Sovereign with a bitter accusation of ingratitude, and expressions of her high resentment. This interview occurred on the 8th of May, and the Queen summoned a convention of her nobility to meet at Stirling on the 15th of the same month. Her object was, to obtain their consent to her marriage previous to the return of Lethington with the answer of Elizabeth, and to accomplish this, she despatched Beaton, a gentleman in whom she had much con fidence, with new instructions, to be delivered to her secretary. They were drawn up in terms very different from his first commission : Mary commanded him to return to the Queen of England, and declare unto her, that since she had been so long trained with fair speeches, and, in the end, beguiled of her expect ation, she had now resolved, with the advice of the Estates of her Realm, to use her own choice in her marriage, and to select such a one as in her opinion should be most worthy of the honour to which he was to be raised. The letter which contained these instructions was written wholly by herself. \" It want ed,\" says Throckmorton, who had seen the original, \" neither eloquence, despite, anger, love, norpassion,\"1 and was evidently dictated by a keen feeling of the ingratitude, duplicity and selfishness with which she had been treated by Elizabeth. He was also directed, after he had finished his negotiation in England, to pass over to France, and use his influence there to 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Throckmorton to Cecil and Leices ter, 11th May, 1565."], [424, "1565. 392 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. procure from the French King and that court, an approval of her choice. To induce her Secretary to enter cordially into her views, Mary at the same time wrote to him with her own hand, \" the most favour- able and gentle letter that ever Queen did address to her servant,\" she sent him also a Bill of Credit, on the receivers of her dowry in France, empowering him to draw for any sum he pleased, and in the event of his success in this mission, promised him the highest preferment which it was in her power to bestow.1 Before, however, her messenger could reach London, Lethington had left that city on his return, and Elizabeth had despatched Sir Nicholas Throckmorton (her late Ambassador in France) on a mission to Scot- land. He was instructed to communicate to the Scottish Queen the resolution of the English Privy Council, to notify her entire disapproval of her union with Darnley, and to take measures to prevent its precipitate consummation. When on the way to the English Court, Beaton encountered Lethington, near Newark, and communicated his message to the Scottish Secretary. Nothing can more strikingly show the treachery of Mary's ministers, and the entire licence they assumed of disobeying, when it was convenient for them, the commands of their Sovereign, than Lethington's conduct on this occa sion. He heard the message, received the Queen's 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Throckmorton to Cecil and Leicester, I lth May, 1565."], [425, "1565. MARY. 393 letters, put them in his pocket, refused alike to return to London, or to pass into France, and postino forward with all speed, overtook Throckmorton at Alnwick ; here he basely communicated to him the secret instructions he had received, and breaking into expressions of extreme rage and indignation to wards his royal mistress, regretted that the English Ambassador was not empowered to denounce war against her in case she resolved to proceed in this marriage, with those whom he denominated the rebels of the English Queen.1 The two Ambassadors then pursued their journey towards Scotland in com pany. \" He was enjoined,\" said Throckmorton, (speaking of Lethington, and writing to Leicester and Cecil)\" to stay me, that I should not come into Scot land, and contrary to that, he will not go without me.\"2 Are we to wonder that, when Mary's affairs were ma naged by such men, she was anxious to change her counsellors, and to seek for fidelity in another fac tion. In the mean time the convention of the nobility which had been summoned to deliberate upon the marriage, assembled at Stirling on the 15th May. It was most numerously attended, and included, with the exception of Lord Ochiltree, and a few others, the whole of the most influential nobles in the king dom. There were present the Duke, with the Earls 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Throckmorton to Cecil and Leicester, 11th May, 1565. 2 Ibid."], [426, "1565. 394 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. of Argile, Murray, Morton, Glencairn, Athol, Crawford, Eglinton, Cassillis, Rothes, and Caith ness. The Lords Hume, Gray, Glamis, Borthwick, Yester, Fleming, Levingston, Semple, Ross, Lindsay, and Lovat. Besides these, there were the Officers of State, including the Secretary, the Justice Clerk, the Treasurer, and the Advocate, with the Commendators of Holyrood, Kilwinning, Jedburgh, St. Colm Inch, and Balmerinoch.1 At this solemn assembly of her nobles, the Queen announced her intention of marry ing Darnley, and the measure was approved of without a dissentient voice. Murray and his faction, whose real sentiments were strongly hostile to such a proceeding, appear to have been overawed into a temporary consent, whilst the great majority of her Barons, admitted its expediency, and advised that it should be carried into effect.2 Thus confirmed in her purpose, Mary on the same day conferred the honour of knighthood upon Darnley, and immediately after created him Lord of Ardmanach and Earl of Ross. He then took the oaths, was girt with the sword, and on rising from his knees before the Queen, himself bestowed the dignity of knighthood upon fourteen gentlemen of ancient and loyal families, who knelt before the throne.3 In the midst of these proceedings, word was brought that Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, Ambassador of the Queen of England, 1 Keith, p. 277. 2 MS.

On being admitted, he delivered in strong language the remonstrance of his royal mistress, he expressed her surprise at the unadvised proceedings of the Scottish Queen, and complained loudly of the presumption of Lennox and Darnley, her own subjects, who, without giving her any pre vious notice, had dared to engage in such an enter prise. To this Mary replied with great calmness and dignity. She said, \" That as soon as she had formed her resolution on the subject of her marriage, she had communicated her intentions to Elizabeth, which was all that she had ever promised to do. As to her good sister's great dislike to the match,\" she observed sarcastically, \" that this was indeed a marvellous circumstance, since the selection was made in con formity to the Queen's wishes, as communicated by Mr. Randolph. She had rejected all foreign suitors, and had chosen an Englishman, descended from the blood royal of both kingdoms, and the first Prince of the blood in England ; and one whom she believed would for these reasons be acceptable to the subjects of both realms.\" ' It was difficult for the Ambassador to answer this temperate remonstrance, which he knew to be founded in truth, and as the Queen treated him with much courtesy, and agreed to postpone the ceremony of creating Darnley Duke of Albany till she heard 1 Throckmorton to Elizabeth, 21st May, 1565.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. ao-ain from Elizabeth, he judged it right neither to push matters to an extremity, nor to hold out any encouragement to her discontented nobles. The English Queen, however, resorting to severer and more decided measures, ordered Lady Lennox into custody, having suspected her of intriguing with the Earl of Northumberland and other leaders of the Papists in England. At the same time, she again (12th June, 1565) submitted to her Privy Council the question of the marriage of the Scottish Queen. Their decision, as it is preserved in the ori ginal draft by Cecil, is of much importance in the light it throws on the state of parties in England. Two questions were propounded to the Council. 1st, What perils might ensue to the Queen's Majesty and her realm, upon the marriage of the Queen of Scot land with Lord Darnley ? 2nd, What was meet to be done to avoid the same ? \" The perils,\" says Cecil, in his minute of what took place, \" being sundry and very many, were reduced by some coun cillors to only two. 1st That by this marriage, the Queen's Majesty being unmarried, a great number in this realm, not of the worst subjects, might be alienated in their minds from their natural duties to iler Majesty, to depend upon the success of this marriage of Scotland, as a mean to establish the succession of both the Crowns in the issue of the same marriage, and to favour all devices and prac tices that should tend to the advancement of the Queen of Scots. Under the second peril it was observed, that con-"], [429, "1565 MARY 397 sidering the chief foundation of that (party) which favoured the marriage with the Lord Darnley, was laid upon the trust of such as were Papists, as the only mean left to restore the religion of Rome, it was plainly to be seen that, both in this realm and in Scotland, the Papists would most favour, maintain, and fortify the marriage of the Lord Darnley, and would, for furtherance of their faction in religion, devise all means and practices that could be within this realm, to disturb the Estate of the Queen's Ma jesty, and the peace of the realm, and consequently to achieve their purpose by force rather than fail.\" The paper proceeds to point out, by way of warn ing to Elizabeth that when Mary's power was the greatest, namely, during her marriage with the Dauphin, she evinced her real mind to dispossess that Princess of her title, both by assuming the style and arms of England, and by troops sent into Scotland to accomplish her ambitious purposes. It then pro ceeds in these remarkable words : \u2014 \" It is also to be remembered that, seeing now before this attempt of marriage, it was found and manifestly seen, that in every corner of the realm the faction that most favoureth the Scottish title is grown stout and bold, yea, seen manifestly in this court, both in hall and chamber, it could not be, but (except good heed were speedily given to it) the same faction would speedily increase by this marriage, and by the prac tice of the fautor (author) thereof, and grow so great and dangerous, as the redress thereof would be almost desperate. And to this purpose it was to be"], [430, "1565. 398 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. remembered, how of late in perusing of the substance of the Justices of Peace in all the counties of the realm, scant ly a third part was found fully assured to be trusted in the matter of religion, upon which only string the Queen of Scots' title doth hang ; and some doubts might be that the friends of the Earl of Lennox had more knowledge of this than was meet, and there by made their vaunt now in Scotland, that their party was so great in England, that the Queen's Majesty dared not attempt to oppose the marriage\" In this sort was the sum of the perils declared. Upon the second question, What was best to be done to avoid these dangers ? it was determined that the first way was to obtain that the Queen's Majesty would marry, and hold them with no long delay. Secondly, that measures should be taken to advance and fortify the profession of religion, both in Scot land and in England. Third, that proceedings should be commenced, either altogether to break off this intended marriage, or at least to procure the same not to be so hurtful to the realm as otherwise it might be ; and lastly, that some intelligence should be used in Scotland with the party opposed to the marriage, and comfort given them from time to time.1 It will be seen from this authentic paper, that the apprehensions entertained regarding the effects of this union with Darnley upon the Popish faction in 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Orig. Draft by Cecil, 4th June, 1565."], [431, "1565. MARY. 399 England (which was far stronger than is generally believed) were not altogether ideal. There seem to have been two parties amongst the English Protest ants, who viewed the match with different feelings. Elizabeth herself, with the Earl of Leicester, and the powerful Anti-Cecilian faction which supported him, were suspected to regard the marriage with no great dislike, although for the moment, she judged it prudent to dissemble, and to appear deeply offended. It delivered the English Queen from the fear that Mary should make some potent foreign alliance \u2014 with Austria or Spain, and it kept at court her favourite Leicester. These sentiments, too, were well known at the Scottish court, and Randolph was repeatedly met by the observation, that the resent ment of his royal mistress was mere dissimulation.1 But the other party were more sincere and determined in their opposition. Cecil, Bedford and Randolph had deeply intrigued with Scotland ; they believed that the overthrow of their friends, the Earls of Murray, Argile, and Lethington, would put an end to Eng lish influence in that country ; they dreaded lest Lennox and Darnley might in time be won over by the Queen to re-establish the Romish Faith, which it was known they secretly professed, and they adopted every means to thwart the designs of the Scottish Queen. Nor were these means of the purest 1 Throckmorton to Sir William Cecil, 21st May, 1565. Printed in Keith, p. 280. Also Randolph to Cecil, 2d July, printed in Keith, p. 288. Also MS. Letter, St. P.

As long as Mary, deceived and drawn on by the protestations and duplicity of Elizabeth, placed herself under the guidance of this Princess, she was represented in the letters of Ran dolph as amiable, truthful, affectionate, and popular. The Protestants were described as contented, except ing only the most violent, whose conduct this Envoy repeatedly censures, and, (which is very remarkable,) not a year before this, both Murray and Lethington had assured the Queen of England, that the conduct of their royal mistress in respect to the reformed reli gion entitled her to high praise ; its foundation they said was perfectly secure, whilst they enjoyed liberty of conscience, and the favour of their Prince, as abun dantly as heart could wish.1 From that moment till the present, not a step had been taken by the Queen of Scotland which could create suspicion in any rea sonable mind, that she meditated aught against the national religion. On the contrary, the Romish party had been treated with undue severity, the pri vate exercise of her religion had been threatened to be abridged, the sanctity of her chapel and her palace invaded, and the laws against the mass carried into the strictest execution ; even where the offenders were of the highest rank in the Church. These were all facts with which Randolph, the English Minister, was perfectly familiar, and which can be proved from his own letters. Yet, no sooner did Mary fix her choice on Darnley ; no sooner did it become MS, Letter, St. P. Off, Murray to Cecil, 13th July, 1564"], [433, "1565. MARY. 401 apparent to Murray that his power was on the wane, and to Randolph, that the English faction in Scot land was likely to lose ground, and to be superseded in their authority, than the letters of this pliant Envoy abounded with complaints and misrepresenta tions. The reformed religion was described as not only in danger, but already ruined, and the godly undone ; the Queen was said to be fallen into universal contempt ; we are told, that her whole character had altered within a few days, that even her counte nance and beauty were decayed, so that many thought she was bewitched, and lastly, that an irre sistible party had resolved to oppose the marriage, and avert the ruin of their country. The events which now occurred, and the conduct respectively pursued by Mary, the Protestants, and Elizabeth, proved these statements to be exaggerated and unfounded. The measures of the Scottish Queen, under an irritating opposition, were temperate and conciliating. She sent Hay, her Master of Requests, a prudent and able man, a favourer of Murray, and a friend of Randolph, on a mission to the English Queen. He was to labour not only to reconcile Eliza beth to her union with Darnley, but to state her anxiety to preserve peace, her resolution to postpone her marriage for a short time, and her desire that there should be a meeting of Commissioners from both countries, to deliberate on the best means of composing the differences which had occurred.1 On 1 Keith, p. 283.

Some time before the mission of Hay, Ran- dolph, describing the pride and passionate temper of this young favourite, thus writes to Cecil. \" Her (Mary's) Councillors are now those whom she liked worst, the nearest of her kin, the farthest from her heart.

What were it for the Queen's Majesty if she list not to do it by force, with the expense of three or four thousand pounds, to do with this country what she would.\" 1 The proceedings of Elizabeth, were at this mo ment marked by that duplicity and desire to embroil Mary with her own subjects, which had all along characterised them. She had already placed the Countess of Lennox under restraint, but she now committed her to the Tower, a severity which could not fail to encourage Murray and his friends.2 She sent a summons to the Earl of Lennox and his son, 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off. Randolph to Leicester, 3d June, 1565. 2 Mr. Stevenson's Illustrations of the reign of Queen Mary, p. 140. 2 d 2"], [436, "1565. 404 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Lord Darnley, commanding them on their allegiance, as English subjects, instantly to repair to her court.1 Not long after, she addressed a letter to the Scottish Queen, declaring her entire disapproval of her pro ceedings, and she instructed Randolph not only directly to communicate with Murray's faction, but to assure them that she would support them against the malice of their enemies as long as their efforts were directed to maintain the religion, and to pre serve the amity between the two kingdoms.2 Nothing upon the part of Murray could be more futile and unfounded than the pretence, that the Pro testant religion was in danger, or that the Queen at this moment had adopted any measures which threatened its security. It is happy for the truth, that on such a point we have the declaration of Murray and Lethington themselves. On the 13th of July, 1564, they stated to Cecil, that the presence of Lennox in Scotland, even if he should be fortunate enough to ally himself with the most powerful person in the state, would be totally ineffectual to shake the national religion from that firm foundation on which it rested.3 These declarations, indeed, were made a year before this, but during the course of that year, not only had the Scottish Queen introduced no one 1 MS.

MARY. 405 measure which could by any ingenuity, be deemed an attack upon the national religion, but she had shown the most decided determination to support it as the religion of the state, and to enforce the cruel and unjust laws against those who adhered to the public exercise of a contrary faith. It is evident, therefore, that the Earl of Murray and the party of the nobles, who opposed the marriage, had raised the cry of \" danger to the Church\" merely to cover their own designs. The same remark does not apply to Knox, who, after his long estrangement from Murray, now once more acted in concert with him. To the stern uncompromi sing mind of this Reformer, the Mass was idolatry; so long as it maintained its place in the Queen's private chapel, he believed that the Protestant faith was in danger, and that in permitting its use, the preachers and the people committed a deadly sin. Murray had always contended for the right of the Queen to have the private exercise of her religion. Knox had as obstinately denied it. He contended that, by the word of God, and the laws of the land, every Priest who dared to celebrate, and every person who ventured to attend, the mass, was obnox ious to capital punishment, and he evidently con sidered that the sufferance of the \" idol,\" under any circumstances, was a direct infringement upon the rights and the security of the national religion. He is to be judged therefore by a different standard from that which must be applied to his ambitious"], [438, "1565. 406 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. and potent ally. Murray was the slave of private ambition : his paramount desire evidently was to re- tain the great power which he possessed, and in his efforts to effect this, he repeated the same game which ambition has so often played ; he masked his selfish projects under a zeal for religion. Knox, on the other hand, however fierce, dictatorial, and even unscru- pulous as to means, was perfectly honest. No Church plunder can be traced to his hands; no pensions from Eno-land or France secured his services, nor is there the slightest evidence (at least I have discovered none) that at any time he pursued a scheme of per- sonal aggrandisement, separate from that spiritual authority which attached itself to him as the great leader of the Reformation. His character was great, irregular, and imperfect. His views were often erroneous. In his mind many subjects assumed an undue importance and magnitude, whilst others, especially those connected with the practical influ- ence of the gospel upon the heart and conduct, were often neglected or forgotten. But in his public career, he was consistent, fearless, sincere ; the sin gle object to which he devoted himself was to estab- lish on a sure foundation, what he believed to be the only true faith\u2014 the only form of worship consistent with the declarations of Scripture, and the glory of God. It is needless to point out to what a height this raises him above Murray, Argile, Lethington, and the crowd of venal barons by whom he was surrounded."], [439, "1565 MARY 407 Mary had summoned a convention of her nobility, to be held at St. Johnstone on the 22d of June.1 It was her intention in this assembly to procure their final consent to her union with Darnley, and to fix the period of her marriage. Instead of obeying her wishes, the discontented barons vigorously exerted themselves to traverse all her schemes. Murray refused to come to Perth, alleging that his life was in danger from a conspiracy formed by Darnley ; Argile, in concert with Knox and the preachers, appointed the general assembly of the Church to be held at Edinburgh, whilst the Convention was sitting at Perth. There seems to be no doubt that the faction of Murray and the party of Knox now acted in concert, and the Reformer, who possessed great influence with the people, bestirred himself so successfully against the Queen, that in a convocation of the citizens, held in the fields near Edinburgh, it was resolved to arm and organize the burgesses, to choose captains, and to seize the weapons of such as were believed, favourable to the marriage. At the same time, after lengthened debates, the general as sembly drew up a supplication to their Sovereign.2 It requested that the blasphemous mass, and all Popish idolatry should be abolished, not only throughout the kingdom, but also in her royal person and household ; that true religion, as it is founded on the 1 Letter, Randolph to Cecil, in Keith, p. 287, 2na July, 1565. 2 Spottiswood, p. 190."], [440, "408 1565. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. word of God, should be professed as well by her self as by her subjects, and that it should be made obligatory upon all persons to resort to the preaching of the word, and to prayers, if not every day, at least every Sunday. It proposed that some sure provision should be made for the support of the ministers of the Gospel. That pluralities should be abolished ; a strict examination instituted into the appointment of all teachers of youth in schools and colleges ; a fund set apart for the maintenance of the poor, out of those lands which of old were destined to hospitality, and some relief devised for the poor labourers of the soil, who were oppressed in the payment of their tithes by unreasonable and illegal exactions.1 This petition was entrusted to the Earl of Glen cairn, with five Commissioners, who repaired to Perth, (1st July, 1565) and presented it to the Queen. Her conduct at this crisis, is entitled to much praise. She was alarmed by the accounts of the hostile and tumultuous assembly of the citizens in Edinburgh, and when she read the demands of the Church, it was evident that they approached indefinitely near to the compelling herself, and all who adhered to the Ro mish faith, to renounce what they believed to be true, and embrace what they were persuaded was false. Yet her answer was temperate and conciliatory ; she declared that it was impossible for her to re nounce the mass herself, or to abolish it in her household, not being yet persuaded that there was Spottiswood, p. 190."], [441, "1565. MARY. 409 any impiety in this great service of the Church. She reminded the Commissioners, how completely liberty of conscience, since her arrival in her dominions, had been permitted to all her subjects, and she expected in return, she said, \" the same liberty to be granted to herself. As for the establishment of religion in the body of the realm, she declared, that she was ready to abide by the decision of the three Estates of Parliament, as soon as they were convened, and to whom alone, as they were well aware, the determination of so important a question belong ed.\" J A more gentle and reasonable reply to an extra vagant demand, could hardly have been given, but the discontented Lords were still unsatisfied. They were undone if the Queen was left to follow her own wishes, and the marriage went forward, and, acting under this conviction, they resolved either to compel her to submit to their dictation, or to put it out of her power to carry her designs into effect. With this purpose, Murray, Argile, and Lord Boyd, held a secret meeting at Lochleven,2 and from thence sent a confidential messenger to communicate their designs to Randolph, and to understand from him, whether Elizabeth would receive Lennox and Darnley if they were seized, and sent prisoners to Berwick. The Ambassador answered, that the Queen, his mis- 1 Spottiswood, p. 190. Keith, p. 289. Randolph to Cecil, 2nd July, 1565. 2 Mr. Stevenson's Illustrations of the reign of Mary, p. 118.

The route to be travelled afforded two favourable situations for such a surprise ; the one a wild narrow defile, near Perth, called the Pass of Dron,1 the other a tract of broken and difficult ground, near Beith, some miles north of the Queen's Ferry. It was intended, according to Randolph's account, to have carried Mary to St. Andrew's, and Darnley to Castle Campbell, but these were only preliminary steps ; Murray's ultimate object (if we may believe the assertion of a brother conspirator) was to murder Darnley, seize the government, and imprison the Queen for life in Lochleven.2 This traitorous plot was signally defeated by the courage and celerity of Mary's movements. Having received some hint of her danger, she commanded Athole and Ruthven to assemble their followers, and leaving Perth with an escort of three hundred horse in the dawn of the morning, traversed the country with the utmost speed, passed Lochleven and Kinross. without drawing bridle, pushed on to the Ferry, and crossing the Firth, reached Calendar House in 1 Knox, p. 412. 2 Randolph to Cecil, 4th July, 1565, in Keith, p. 291.

They resumed in a still louder tone the cry, that the Queen was determined to overthrow religion, to break the amity which had of late united them to England, and to commence anew her persecution of the brethren. They implored the assistance and support of Elizabeth, assured her that Bothwell, the mortal enemy of English influence, had been sent for \u2014 be sought her to let loose \" some strapping Elliots\" upon Lord Hume, Mary's great partizan, on the marches towards Lothian, who might keep his hands full at home, and attempted to rouse her jealousy by spreading rumours of an intercourse with France and Rome.2 But from neither quarter did they receive much sympathy or encouragement; Elizabeth fed them with empty promises, the people grew luke warm or suspicious. They were aware of no act upon the part of the Queen which manifested hostility to their religion ; on the contrary, when at Callendar, she had, for the first time in her life, attended the Protestant sermon. She declared her readiness to hear Erskine of Dun, one of the leading Reformers, but a man of a mild and peaceable disposition, in his 1 Randolph to Cecil, in Keith, p. 291.

But her last measure was the most decisive of all. She 1 MS. Privy Council Book, p. 73.

He had refused to attend the convention at Stirling ; alleging, that his life was in danger, from a conspiracy of Lennox and Darnley. These noblemen indignantly repelled the charge, and the Scottish Queen, anxious to do jus tice to both parties, summoned him to appear, and make good his accusation. Lest he should plead that his obedience to her commands might expose him to the attacks of his enemies, she sent him her letters of safe-conduct.

It warned Mary that nothing but open force could reduce her opponents, and it convinced many who were wavering, that the alleged conspiracy was an invention of his own, equally unfounded with the alarm regarding the overthrow of the Pro testant religion, and got up for the same purpose, of veiling his attempt for the recovery of the power which he had lost. Meanwhile he had no mean assistant in Ran dolph. The character of this crafty agent of Cecil was of that accommodating and equivocal kind, which, without loving misrepresentation (to use a mild word) for its own sake, did not hesitate to employ it, when he thought it would forward the designs of his royal mistress, or of her principal minis ter. As long as all went smoothly in Scotland, as long as the Queen, deceived by the promises of Eliza beth, and acting under the guidance of Murray, was willing to consult the wishes of her royal sister, the letters of Randolph convey to us a pretty fair picture of the conduct of Mary, and the progress of events ; but as soon as she began to act for herself \u2014 as soon as her brother, the friend of Eng land, was stript of his power and lost his influence, this minister transmitted to Cecil, and to the English Queen, the most false and distorted accounts of the state of the country. His object was, to induce Elizabeth to assist the insurgent Lords with money and troops, as she had already done in the war of the"], [447, "1565 MARY 415 Reformation, and to accomplish this end, he not only concealed the truth, but did not scruple to em ploy calumny and falsehood. He represented Mary's proceedings to her nobles as tyrannical, when they were forbearing ; he described her as earnestly bent on the destruction of religion, when for five years she had maintained it exactly as she found it on her arrival, and had recently, by a solemn proclamation, declared her determination to preserve the fullest liberty of conscience ; he painted her as an object of contempt to her subjects, when she was popular and beloved ; and as deserted by her nobles and her people, when, in consequence of the late summons, her Barons and vassals were daily crowding into the capital.1 On the other hand, Murray and his faction were equally falsely depicted as so strong, that the country lay at their mercy, whilst they waited only for the advice and the money of England, to sweep away every opposition, and compel the Queen to place herself once more at their dispo sal. These accounts, however, made little impres sion upon the English Queen, and it is probable that she was aware of their being inconsistent with the truth. She directed her Ambassador, however, to intercede for Murray, but the application, as might have been expected, met with no success. Mary 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Randolph to Cecil, July 7, 1565.

Every hour added to the strength of the Queen ; her solemn public assu rances, that no alteration was meditated in the national religion, her successful detection of the in terested schemes, and false representations of her enemies, the vigor and decision with which she acted, and the anxiety she evinced to preserve amity with Elizabeth, although irritated by the constant misrepresentations and seditious intrigues of Ran dolph, all these circumstances produced the most favourable effect, and convinced the great body of 1 Keith, p. 303, Randolph to Cecil, 21st July, 1565. 5 Keith, p. 304."], [449, "1565 417 MARY her subjects that Murray and the faction who opposed her measures, were actuated by no other motives than selfishness and ambition. It was now the end of July, and Chisholm, Bishop of Dumblane, having arrived from Rome, with a dispensation for the marriage, it was intimated to the people by a public proclamation, that the Queen had resolved to take to her husband an illustrious Prince, Henry Duke of Albany, for which reason she commanded her subjects henceforth to give him the title of King. Next day, being Sunday, the 29th of July, the ceremony was performed in the royal chapel of Holyrood, at six in the morning. Mary was habited in deep mourning, and it was super stitiously observed, that it was the same dress which she wore on the melancholy day of her late husband's obsequies. After the solemnity, and when the youthful pair had risen from the altar, Darnley embraced and kissed the bride, and retiring from the chapel, left her to hear the mass alone, surrounded only by those nobles who adhered to the ancient faith. On the conclusion of the service, being conducted back to her chamber, she consented, at the earnest entreaty of her husband, to renounce her weeds, and assume a costume more suited to the happiness of the day. The banquet succeeded, in which the Queen was served by the Earl of Athole, as sewer, Morton, as carver, and Crawford, as cup bearer.

The leading nobles in Sco'j\u00abL\u00abad at this time were the Earls of Angus, Huntley, Argile, and Sir George Douglas, brother to Angus. All of them deserted the Go vernor, and entered into secret and treasonable transactions with England. I proceed to prove this by the evidence of original letters : \u2014 On the 10th of September, the Battle of Pinky was fought, and on the ISth of the same month, the Protector Somerset commenced his retreat. On the 20th of October, Lord Gray, of Wilton, ad- dressed a letter to the Protector,1 in which he gives the substance of an interview which passed between him and Sir George Douglas. He (Douglas) says Gray, liked well all^the Articles, (alluding to the Secret Articlesof Agreement mentioned in the text,p. 44), exceptthat by which, in the event of the young Queen's marriage to any other than Edward the VI, they bind themselves to serve the King's Ma jesty against their own country\" He began, (I use the words of Gray's letter) \" He began to allege what it was to forsake his native country, and living there, he showed me also that he had yearly of the Queen, a stipend of one thousand crowns, and of the French King as much, and now, since his being with me, the Governor sent for him, to speak to him, and] offered him an Abbey of another thousand crowns by year, but he came not at him, nor will not do, but if I would mitigate that article, he was contented with the rest. I showed him, that if lie refused part, he must refuse the whole. * * And then at the last he granted thereunto, and hath both made his othe upon the testament lo observe them, and subscribed the same for a witness thereof, in sort as all others have done.\" Douglas entreated Gray to induce the Lord Protector to erase this Article, which Gray assured him he was not likely to do. He then communicated his \" device,\" which, with certain requests on his own behalf, Gray inclosed to Somerset. Douglas declared that he intended to go with them (the English army) himself and be their guide, but enjoined secrecy of this private transaction, as if it trans- pired, he should not be able to win his friends. I subjoin a brief abs- tract of the paper, given in by Douglas, entitled, \" The order of an Invasion into Scotland, devised by Sir George Douglas, to be at- 1 MS. Letter, St. P.

The Lord Gray addressing Somerset, adds this emphatic sentence, \" Your Grace, 1 From a curious paper, published for the first time by Mr. Steven son, in his \"Illustrations of the Reign of Queen Mary,'' p. 99, from the Harleian MS. 289, sol. 73, we learn that this intended Invasion was stopt by the advice of Thomas Bishop, an adherent of Lennox, who on good grounds suspected that Douglas was acting treacherously. \" My device to him (the Protector), says Bishop and the Duke of Noithum berland, at Shene, stopt my Lord Gray from entering Scotland with six thou sand men, whereof the greatest force horsemen, being then the flower of England \u2014 his journey being devised by George Douglas, tohave brought them to the butchery, as well was known after.

Huntly was a Roman Catholic ; his pos sessions and power in the north, were almost kingly \u2022 he had been taken prisoner at Pinky, and was anxious to be permitted to return to Scotland on his parole. Argile, on the other hand, was the great rival of Huntly in the north, he had escaped at Pinky, he was a supporter of the Reformation, and one of the most able and ambitious men in Scotland. The Protector Somerset played the one against the other. Argile, on the 25th December, 1547, had come to St. Johnston, with an army of Highlandmen, thinking to annoy Dudley, the English Governor of Broughty, and ravage the country, which had taken assurance of the English. Some time after this, he threatened to join the French in besieging Brought)',2 and continued these hostile denunciations till the 5th of February, 1547-8, when Sir Andrew Dudley addressed a letter to the Protector in which he informed him, that at the suit of Lord Gray, (of Scotland) and other gentlemen of Angus, he had granted Argile an assurance for twenty days for the whole country of Angus. \u2014 There then follows this sentence : \u2014 \" There \u2022were two assurances made between the Earl of Argile and me (Dudley), the one open to the Bishops and Council, the other secret between Argile, Gray and me, to be a favourer of the King's godly purpose, and to take the King's Majesty's part in the same, on which communing the Lord Gray borrowed one thousand crowns of me to give the Earl of Argile, to make him the more earnest ' MS.

On the 6th March, 1547-8, Dudley informed the Protector, that the Scottish Earl had come to Cow per, and that Lord Gray (of Scotland) had ridden with Mr. Brenne that morning to communicate with him there [MS. Letter, State Paper Office, 6th March, 1547-8. Sir Andrew Dudley to the Protector]. The result of this communication appears from a letter of Brende to the Protector [MS. Letter, State Paper Office, 9th March, 1547-8.] It states, that on the 6th of that month, he with Lord Gray, met Argile, near St. Johnston's. Brende thanked him for the good disposition which he had shown to the purpose of the marriage. Argile regretted the damage done by the war, and professed his willingness to work some mean for the redress thereof. Brende then wished to draw him on to make some proposal or some promise. This he warily declined, requesting him to show what the Protector required ; Brende then proceeds thus, \" And when I was about to declare, he bad stay ; 'lam held,' quoth he, 'in a marvellous jealousy, and there be,' he said, ' certain of the Council mortal enemies to your part. I would therefore,' quoth he, * to colour the matter, ye should devise to speak somewhat openly to me, before them of such matter as ye think good, which shall be a mean that, without sus- 1 MS.

Then called he before him the Abbot of Cowper, the Lord called Stuard, Sir John Cammel, and divers others. This gentleman, quoth he, hath commission to me, and because it partly toucheth you, ye shall hear what he will say,' Brende then proceeded to declare the purpose of the marriage, the opposition of evil men, and the causeofthe war. 'And thereupon,' says he, * I plucked forth, and presented to the Earl a parcel of my instructions, which I had drawn forth for that purpose (no thing mentioning the Earl (Argile) nor any proffer made unto him) but only purporting a present contract of marriage, &c, the deliver ing the Castles of Edinburgh and Dunbar, as pledges for the Queen's entry into England, and the conditions of peace. When this was done, the Earl somewhat spoke, ' how greatly fair means might prevail in this matter, and how much violence made against the purpose,' which words confirmed with a churme (murmur) of those that stood about ; somewhat I did speak again to the purpose, when violence should be used, and in what cases it was lawful for Princes to use the sword. Then did he draw me aside, and allowed my device. ' Hereupon,' quoth he, ' me shall colour our treaty, and blind these wolves eyes,' and willed me to proceed in my secret commission. Brende then thanked him for his good disposition, and told him, they knew he had the power, wherefore if good will were joined in him with power there would be no further doubt of success. He (Brende) showed the great advantages which would ensue, besides the honour to himself, ' and so declared his reward for bringing it to pass,' \u2014 that is, for accomplishing the first point of his instructions, viz: \u2014 the delivery of the Queen. ' If all things ' said he, (Argile) ' had chanced w-ell she had been in my hands ere this, for if after the battle ( Pinkey ) pursuit had been made, she had come into my country ; and she wrote to me for the same purpose at the last entry of the Lord Gray.

And because his resolution therein was not to the full effect of my instructions, I took advantage of his promise therein, and passed to the \"2nd point, which he liked well (except the authority of the Priests, not provided for in the articles) saying, ' he would pass to the Court, and persuade the Governor and the Queen imme diately to send Ambassadors for the accomplishment of of it. ' And if,' quoth I, * they will not agree to your request, what will ye do then?' ' What would you I should do?' quoth he, then I plucked forth a paper of the third degree, as I had them all four severally written, touching the taking of open part with the King's Majesty, and showed it him \u2014 he required to have it, that he might read it, and examine it with himself.\" \" When he had put the same in his bosom, we fell in the rehearsal of divers things, and knowing of a certain envy between the Earl of Huntly and him, I took occasion to talk of the said Earl. When he heard him named, he started, and beating his fist upon the board, said, ' If ye let him home, ye mar all.' Whereupon I took occasion. ' My Lord,' quoth I, ' therefore it behoveth you to take this matter on hand, for if you will not, he may perchance be so persuaded, that he himself will enterprize this thing/ which words moved him marvellous much, and he said, ' Marry ! I will do it indeed.' \u2014 Then proceeded I, ' If the Governor will still see the ruin of the country, and still stand on the contrary part, what shall become of him?' ' No Governor,' quoth he. ' Who then/ quoth I, ' is so meet as your Lordship ? ' I think/ quoth he, ' I have most friends and power. If then,' quoth I, ' we have the favour and power of England joined thereunto, who shall withstand you.' ' It is true/ quoth he. Finally he condescended to the third article in this effect.' That if the Queen and the Governor would not agree to these covenants, then would he straitway repair to Argile, there call all his friends about him, declare to them his mind, and require them to take his part in this purpose, and then to send one unto your Grace, to conclude upon certain points of his proceeding before he do further. * * I per eeive he would covenant to have aid against his enemies in the"], [461, "PROOFS AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 429 North by sea, and require that the Earl of Lennox should have no power on his lands in the West parts. When I saw he had thus condescended, I did not touch the fourth degree, otherwise than that he should lett (hinder) the conveyance away of the Queen.\" Brende then promised him an assurance for his country for fifteen days. At first Argile would not subscribe, or set his seal to the agreements which Brende had drawn. The English Envoy then broke off; but late in the night, when all were in bed, he sent Lord Gray to urge Argile, ' and finally after four or five times going and coming betwixt us in the dead time of night, he at last was brought to such case, that in the morning he signed.' Argile's character, as given by Brende, is this. \" I have heard him reported to be much constant. 1 found him humane, wise and grave, in whom I could have believed all things that he said if I had not determined in them to trust nothing at all. 1 judge him greedy of gere, desirous of authority, * * * and therefore moved unto this by the envy he beareth to the Governor, and the emulation he hath with the Earl of Huntly, which will be ever of the contrary part to him, therefore the matter, in my opinion, consisteth in this point, whether your Grace's purpose may take better effect in letting the Earl of Huntly home, so to raise factions betwixt them, or else by detaining him to have the Earl of Argile wholly in that part, if so be he will stand unto bis promise.\" \u2014 The Letter which contains the above interestingdetails,is dated Warkworth, 9th March. 1547-8. \u2014 and signed, John Brende. Notwithstanding the promise to Argile, the Protector entered into a secret agreement with the Earl of Huntly, who engaged if allowed to return home, to embrace the English faction, and fur ther the King's (Edward the VF.) Majesty's affairs. This appears from the following letter of Huntly, to the Protector, dated New castle, 20th March, 1 547-8. 1 The Earl of Huntly to the Protector. \" My Lord, \u2014 After most humble commendations of service unto your Grace, it pleases you to witt We arrived at Newcastle 18th, and has heard no word of Scotland yet, except a man of mine who came with my Lord Gray, Lieutenant, and met me by the way. 1 MS.

As some obscurity hangs over the arrival of the French auxili aries in Scotland, it will be useful to fix precisely the dates, which are not very clearly given either by Keith or by Robertson. The following abstract of a letter from Sir R. Bulmer to the Protector, marks the arrival of the first band of French, chiefly officers, to have been on the 25th December, 1547. Sir RalphBulmer to the Protector. He sends his Grace these news, which had been brought by the Lord of Cessford. \" Christmas-day last past, two French ships came to Dumbarton \u2014 there landed with fifty French captains \u2014 bringing money to wage ten thousand Scots for a year, which money is sent by the Bishop of Rome. There came three of the chief captains to Stirling, to the Queen and the Lords, on St. Stephen's day at night \u2014 apparelled all in white satin, and told the Queen and the Council the cause of their coming. They showed her there was six thousand Frenchmen on the sea for Scotland, waiting a wind.

By another letter from Lord Grey to the Protector, dated at Berwick, June 17, 1548 QMS. State Paper Offices, it appears that the second arrival of auxiliaries, conducted by Monsieur D'Esse, must have been June 15th or 16th, 1548. This was the great force, including Suisses and Almains, as well as French. Lord Grey diminishes their number to twelve hundred men at arms, and eight hundred light-horse-men ; but they were at the least six thousand strong, as is proved by a letter, State Paper Office, Lord Wharton to the Protector, dated 14th July, 1548. IV. Embarkation of the young Queen for France History, p. 53. Neither Keith, p. 55, nor Chalmers, p. 10, are able to six the exact time of the young Queen's sailing for France. A letter, in the State Paper Office, from Lord Grey to the Protector, which is dated August 7th, 1548, mentions, that he is informed the young Queen is not yet transported, but lieth in a galley accompanied with other galleys, and four or five ships, a little from Dumbarton, where he adds, she undoubtedly was yesterday, at twelve of the clock at noon. And he continues \" the Lady Fleming, her mistress, making request to the captain of the galley, whose name is Wallegagno ( Ville gaignon), to have her on land to repose her, because she hath been long on the sea : He answered, she should not come on land, but rather go into France, or else drown by the way'' Grey advises the Pro tector to fit out some ships that way, with the hope of meeting her.

My attention was directed to it by my learned friend, Mr. Holmes, of the British Museum, who pointed out the following passages. In the first of them, Henry the II. writing to Mon sieur de Humyeres, the governor of his children, who were then brought up at the Palace of St. Germain en Lave \u2014 informs him (on the 27th July, 1548) that the little Queen of Scotland may soon be expected there, to be educated with the Dauphin and his other children. \" Mais pour cela je ne veulx que vous bougez avec mes enfans, attendu maintenant que ma fille la petite Royne d'Escosse y pourra lors ou plustot arriver poury estre nourrie avec eulx. \"27th July, 1548.\" In another letter from the King to Monsieur de Humyeres, he sends the Dauphin and the young Queen of Scots, a dancing master, Paul de Rege, to whom he gives a high character. The letter is dated 10th January, 1549- Mon Cousin. Pour ce que Paule de Rege present porteur est fort bien balladin, et a ce que j'en y peu coagnoistre honneste et bien conditionnee, j'ay advise de le donner a mons filz le Dauphin pour luy monster a bailer, et pareillment a ma fille la Royne d'Escosse et aux jeunes gentilhommes et damoiselles estant a leur service, et de mes autres enfans ; \" a ceste cause vous le presen terez a mon filz, et le ferez loger et manger avec ses autres officiers.\" V. Ferocity of the Wak. The War assumed a character of more than common ferocity. History p. 55. In addition to what is mentioned in the text, this fact is strikingly illustrated by a paper [MS. State Paper Office, 19th May, 1549] entitled Memorial (it should rather be scroll of a memorial) for Ed ward Atkinson, alias Bluemantle, sent by the Protector to the Gover nor of Scotland. This document states, that after having obtained audience, the said Bluemantle, putting on his coat of arms, and making reverence unto him, (the Governor) without any other saluta-"], [467, "435 PROOFS AND ILLUSTRATIONS. tion, shall boldly say as ensueth. The substance is, that under standing that sundry the King's Majesty's, his Grace's Sovereign Lord's subjects and servants, born within the realm of Scotland, have now a good while, and yet do, according to their bounden duty, serve his Majesty in these wars; the Governor had pub lished a proclamation, commanding, that if any Scotsmen so serving, shall be taken in the field bearing arms against him, they shall not be used as prisoners, but immediately put to death as rebels. Bluemantle is enjoined to demand this proclamation to be immedi ately recalled, otherwise all Scottish prisoners, of whatever rank they be, shall be put to death as soon as they are taken.\" This paper is followed by a \" Minute of a Proclamation for not taking of Scottish men \u2014 dated 22nd May, 1549.\" It commences thus \u2014 \"Whereas the Earl of Arran, pretending himself to be Governor of Scotland,\" and goes on to speak of the people of Scotland not acknowledg ing, or giving obedience to \" their superior and Sovereign Lord, the King's Majesty of England, in consequence of which the coun trys are at war, and Scotland grievously afflicted with slaughter and devastation, as with a just plague of God.\" It then proceeds thus \u2014 \" Not content with all this, the Governor hath devised a most cruel, unnatural, and deadly proclamation, that every Scots man serving the King of England, should be slain as soon as taken, by means of which some of his Majesty's subjects, Scots men born, have been put to open and cruel death.\" Therefore it continues, \" that cruelty may be punished, and repelled with cruelty,\" he, the Protector, straightly commands all his Highness's wardens, deputy-wardens, officers, &c, that they do not from henceforth take any Scotsman serving against his Highness in the field, but do kill the same out of hand without ransoming them, until the Governor Arran have revoked his proclamation, under penalty of death, if this is disobeyed. VI Arrival of the Queen Dowager in Francf. History, pp. 60, 61. The exact date of this Princes's arrival in France, has not been given by any of our Historians. In an original letter of Anne de Montmorency, constable of 2 F 2"], [468, "436 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. France, to Mr. de Bassefontaine, Ambassador to the Queen of Hungary, (for the knowledge of which I am indebted to Mr. Holmes, of the British Museum,) there is the following notice of the arrival of the Queen Dowager in France. The let ter is in the British Museum. Additional MSS. 10,012, and is dated 27th September, 1550. \" Je vous advise que la Royne d'Escosse est puis trois ou quatre jours arrivee au Havre de Grace en bonne sante et tresbonne compagnie; elle fit hier son entree a Rouen.

Sir John Mason's Correspondence Some interesting particulars, illustrating the intrigues of the Queen Dowager, in France, a subject hitherto slightly passed over by our Historians, may be derived from a volume in the State Paper Office, containing the correspondence of Sir John Mason, the English Ambassador at the Court of France. Its authenticity is unques tionable, as it is Sir John's own Letter Book. \" We learn, by a letter from Mason to the Privy Council, dated Rouen, 6th October [Correspondence, p. 118], that he had that day visited the Queen Dowager of Scotland, who arrived there on the 25th of September, accompanied by a numerous train of Scottish gentlemen, and was received with much honour.\" On the 19th of the same month and year, (1550) Mason has this passage in a letter to the Privy Council, dated Dieppe. \" Since their coming the principal of the Scots have visited me except the Earl of Huntly and George Douglas. They lamented, their estate, and showed why we (the English) had not our desire, (the King's marriage to Queen Mary) which was ' the rude hand ling of them at all times, and especially in the notable slaughter made upon them at the great battle (Pinky).' I gave ear unto them as unto Scots, told them they had refused a good offer, and must drink as"], [469, "437 PROOFS AND ILLUSTRATIONS. they had brewed. That they had lively plaid the part of the horse in Aesop, who sought the help of man against the hart. The Earl of Glencairn much complaineth of the detaining of his two sons, his father being dead, for whom they were pledges, but spe cially of the ill-handling of them by the Archbishop, who, he saith, kept them two years in his kitchen.\" I shall subjoin a few brief abstracts of some important letters, addressed by the same Ambassador to the Privy Council. They throw considerable light on the relative politics of France, Eng land, and Scotland, at this period. In a letter dated Blois, 4th December, 1550, he remarks that \" the Scots bear a fell rout in this Court, and be much made of, of all estates. They say we shall not have one foot of ground in Scotland peaceably, more than we had before the wars, but they will have the thanks for it all together, if we like, and not forego it by piece meal. Ireland is ready to revolt and deliver them selves to a new master on a moment's warning. In a subsequent letter, dated Blois, 8th Feb. 1550-1, he states, that the blind Scot, named the Bishop of Armagh, who had lately been in Ireland with commission to make a stir among the people, passed five or six days ago by this Court, and has been much made of. He is departed to Rome. Again on the 23rd Feb. 1550-1, writing to the Council, he informs them, that there were rumours of war secretly intended by France against England. England had refused a passport to the Master of Maxwell, at which the French King, was much incensed. Ex claiming, \" Vraiment voyez ci une pauvre vengeance.\" \" There is in these men no love.'' The Queen of Scots and her house beareth in this Court the whole swing. * * * The Queen Dowager desireth the subversion of England \" whose service in Scotland is so highly taken here, as she is in this Court made a Goddess.\" These men the French, are in great readiness for the wars.= In a letter of the Lords of the Privy Council to Mason, dated at 1 Mason to the Privy Council, 4th Dec. 1550.

Greenwich, the 28th of Jan. 1550, it appears that a spy had been sent, whom Balnevis, the Scot, recommended as proper to be trusted, and who would take care to bring the English Ambassador as much intelligence as the Scots have. Jn Sir John Mason's answer to the Privy Council, dated Blois, 26th Feb. 1550-1, he informs them that this bearer arrived on the 24th Feb., but dared not tarry, as he found himself likely to be waylaid. He, however, had one who would fill his place, viz. the lord Grange. \" I talked with him,\" says Mason, \" of the Queen's departing, and of the men-of-war she was said to have with her.\" He said, \" this would not take any effect this year. He (Grange) promised to communicate every thing he could learn to the English Ambassador, who when he speaks of him, is to call him Corax.\" By a letter of Mason to' the Privy Council, 23rd March, 1550-1, dated at Blois, it appears, that the Vidame of Chartres was at that time in Edin burgh, on a mission from France. In another letter of the 18th April, 1551, from the same to the same, it is stated, that one George Paris had arrived from Ireland. \" He brags much,\" says Mason, \" associates with the Scots, and has offers from the Irish to league with France, and throw off England. He hopes to have the Dauphin shortly proclaimed King of Scotland and Ireland. It is said they are to have no open assistance from France, but that the Queen of Scotland laboureth to have them holpen underhand by means of the Earl of Argile and James Kennalt (Maconnell). He goes on to observe, that John a Barton had arrived from Scot land at the French Court, aud brought word that the Governor (Arran) had a great party in his favour to keep him in his place till they should have a King. This, he adds, was ill-taken by the Queen Dowager, who was determined either to have the govern ment herself, or to set a Frenchman of her House in it. Corax (Grange) thinks if the meeting of the Commissioners for the borders goes on smoothly ; all things will be quiet for this year. The Earl of Huntly had obtained one part of his suit from the Queen of Scots, which was, that when she came of age, he should have the Earldom of .Murray. This King (the King of France) hath bound himself by writing thereunto, but the custody of the bond is to be in the hands of the Dowager. All the Scots are against him in this, especially Sutherland and Cassillis. It"], [471, "439 PROOFS AND ILLUSTRATIONS. will breed a great stab amongst them. \" The Queen is all for her self and for a few other friends, whose partiality showed more to some than others maketh a great heartburning.\" Lord Maxwell at his departing, had a chain of five hundred crowns; Drumlau rich had nothing, and used rude speech to the Queen. \"The Scottish Queen's shipping is hasted very much. It is thought she shall embark a month sooner than she intended. The Lady Fleming departed hence, with child by this King.1 And it is thought that immediately upon the arrival of the Dowager in Scotland, she will come again to fetch another. If she so do, here is like to be a combat, being the heartburning already very great. The old worn pelf,2 fearing thereby to lose some part of her credit, who presently reigneth alone, and governeth without empeasche.\" We learn something of the French intrigues in Ireland, by a letter of Mason to the Privy Council, dated at Amhoise, 22nd April, 1551. He states, that a gentleman who had come from Ireland with George Paris, was named Cormac Ochonor, eldest of nine brothers who are alive. He braggeth his father hath been the great worker of all this rebellion ; he never would submit to England, although he hath a house within a stone's cast of the English pale. Last Saturday he exhibited to the constable a paper, showing what force both horse and foot his father could bring into the field ; asked for prompt assistance, as it was by the French intrigues this rebellion had wholly been stirred up. He begged for five thousand men at the French King's charges. He was paid with fair words. \" The Dowager of Scotland would fain have them holpen, and I am assuredly informed the Vidame is nothing behind them, who, since his coming hither hath been very highly and friendly entertained by the King.\" He hath had many secret conferences with the King, the Dowager, and the Constable. \" The Vidame had come from a mission into Scotland.\" By another letter, dated 1 This was, I suspect, the Dowager Lady Fleming, a daughter of James IV. by the Countess of Bothwell. \u2014 Douglas Peerage, p. 69S. 2 The \" old pelf was the King's mistress Diana of Poictiers,\" a woman at this time of fifty-three years. \u2014 Mezeray, p. 623."], [472, "440 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 26th April, 1551, it appears \" that the Scottish Queen's departure * * * was again delayed, and some thought the occasion thereof was some fancy the French King hath to some of her train.\" 1 In his next letter, 29th April, 1551, at Amboise, Sir John Mason informed the English Privy Council, that he had made dili- gent search as to the news brought by a post from Scotland. \" I have learned,\" says he, \" that there is come to light a practice (or at the least a great suspicion thereof) for the poisoning of the young Queen. He that took the matter upon him is an archer of the guard, who is escaped into Ireland. There is as much diligence made as can be devised for the getting of him from thence, and as they say here, he is already stayed to be sent back again to Scotland, and so into France. The old Queen is fallen suddenly sick upon the opening of this news unto her. By whose means this thing should principally be moved, I cannot yet understand, but it is thought that it was devised by some miscontented Scots. This is told me for a great secrecy, whether it be true or not, your Ladyship may know farther with time. * * The said post hath brought word, that the Lady Fleming is brought to bed of a man child, wherat our women do not much rejoice.\"2 On the 10th of May, 1551, Sir John Mason writing from Court to the English Privy Council, observes, \" There hath been lately a great consultation touching the marriage of the Dolphin to the Scottish Queen, which the Constable and the Chancellor would in any case to be deferred.'' \" The Dowager of Scotland maketh all at this Court weary from the high to the low, such an importunate beggar is she for herself. The King would fain be rid of her, and she as she pretendeth would fain be gone. Marry, the hucking is about many matters, the King being desirous she should depart, upon promise of the sending thereof to her, and she desiring to have the same with her. The sums are two hundred thousand franks of old debts, which is in a manner all paid ; and besides that, fifty thousand franks more, partly for the payment of other pensions accorded among the Scots, and partly \"to remain at 1 Mason to the Privy Council, 26th April, 155). \u2014 Amboise. 2 Same to same, p. 309, May 10th 1551. -From Court."], [473, "PROOFS AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 441 her disposition as she shall see cause, and fifty thousand for her own pension for that year.

On the 19th May Mason alludes to the French intrigues in Ireland. * * \"I saw,\" says he, \" yes terday, a letter sent from Rome to an Italian in this Court, wherein was written, that the Bishop of Armachan, as he calleth himself, which is the blind Scot that lately passed this way, is thoroughly and very well despatched, touching the matters of Ireland.\" It appears by a subsequent letter of June 11th, that the \" blind Scot,\" the Bishop of Armagh, had departed with his dispatch towards Ireland. The last letter in this valuable volume of Sir John Mason's Correspondence, is dated July 29, 1551. Sir William Pickering, and soon after him Sir Nicholas Wotton, succeeded Mason as Ambassadors at the French Court, and their letters which are preserved in the French Correspondence of the State Paper Office, vol. vi., contain many interesting illustra tions, not only of the politics of France and England, but of the condition of Scotland and of Ireland during the last years of Edward and the commencement of the reign of Mary. Indeed, I might rather say, they illustrate the history of Europe ; for it was the business of the English Ambassador at the Court of France, to have his agents or spies in Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands, and to transmit to the Sovereign, the Prime Minister, and the Privy Council of England, reports of all the information which he received. Mary of Guise's interview with Edward the Sixth took place on the 4th of Nov. 1551, and she appears to have returned to Scotland about the 24th of the same month, as in the books of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, under the date 21st Nov. 1551, we find an order directed to Sir Andrew Ker, of Littledean, causing him to send letters of Proclamation to Jedburgh, Selkirk, Dunse, &c, charging the Lords, Lairds, and other Gentlemen to meet the Queen at our Lady Kirk, of Steil, in their most honest manner, on the 24th November. In a letter dated Sept. 19th, 1552, preserved in the French Cor-"], [474, "442 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. respondence, we find a paper, entitled Secret Information of Thomas Stukely, which details \" a plan of the French King for the conquest of England.\" \u2014 First, he would order that the Scots should enter into Northumberland with all their power; then he himself would come to Falmouth, and the Duke of Guise with another army to land at Dartmouth. He would proclaim and restore the old mass, putting the people to their full liberty as he doth in Scotland. In a letter from Sir N. Wotton to the Privy Council, dated at Melun, 28th Dec. 1553, he informs them, that the report of the Queen of England's marriage with the Prince of Spain, made the French begin to speak of war with England, and he adds, that the French King had already despatched Monsieur D'Oysel with the same Commission that he had on his former mission, and that he meant to send after him the Vidame of Chartres with a certain number of soldiers. We find by a letter of Wotton's to the Council, Melun, Jan. 9, 1553-4, that the Queen of Scots now kept her table and lodg ing apart, to show that she had come to her years to have the whole rule in her own hands. I shall conclude these short notices of the valuable matter which may be found in the French Corre spondence of the State Paper Office, by the following letter of Wotton to the Lord Paget, Privy Seal, and Sir William Petre, Knight, Principal Secretary. It is dated 1st March, 1556-7, and is written wholly in cipher, but fortunately the contemporary decipher accompanies it. \" My duty remembered to your Honours. I have heretofore certified the Queen's Majesty, what good will this bearer Kirkau drie (Kircaldy) seemed to bear to her Majesty, and to the realm of England, and how little he is contented with the present state of Scotland, and how desirous he is to see it delivered from the yoke of the Frenchmen, and restored to their former liberty ; and also what offers he hath divers times made to serve the Queen's Ma jesty, the best he could. Whereupon, altho' I have had no answer, yet forasmuch as he returneth now into Scotland, and thereby hath occasion to pass thro' England, I advised him to do that thing which I perceived he was before of himself minded to do, that is to say,to visit you by the way, thereby you may, by communication with him, the"], [475, "PROOFS AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 443 better understand his mind * * and in case you like him, appoint him how he is to serve. Marry, this he earnestly requireth, that in case the Queen's Highness shall think him mete to do her Ma jesty's service, that yet, nevertheless, his matters may pass only thro' your hands, for he feareth greatly, that all the Council being privy to it, it were not easy to be kept secret, thereby he should stand in danger of his life. \" Now in case you should ask me what I think of him, first I must say that I have had no acquaintance with him, but sith my coming hither. Marry, by the communication I have had with him now and then here, either he must he a very great and crafty dissembler, or else he beareth no good will at all to the Frenchmen, and next unto his own country he beareth a good mind to England. \" Marry, what service he shall be able to do now, he in tending to continue in Scotland, your wisdoms can better consider than I. For because, I trust he will declare at length unto you of the return of his father, and of Balnevis into Scotland, and for what purpose it is thought they are revoked, and also that Melvin, who accused the Bishop of Durham, is come hither, recommended to the French King by the Dowager of Scotland's letters, and of th' arrival of the four Scottish bands of horsemen, and of a plott (plan) of Berwick, which the French King hath, howsom ever he came by it \u2014 and how these men are nothing sorry for the Earl of Douglas's death, and of a Scottish physitian married in London, named Durham, as I remember, who is a spy for the French King and the Dowager of Scotland, and hath a pension of her, three hundred crowns by the year, therefore, and how ill the Bishop of St. Andrew's can away with the rule of the Frenchmen in Scotland, and also of th' arrival of one of the Landgrave of Hesse's sons into the court here, and how he is made of, and how sorry they were here for Marquis Albert's death, and generally of such news as are spoken of here in the court. I shall therefore the less need to unite them at this time, but making here an end, &c. &c. \". Paris 1st March, 1556 7\" In the following passage, which occurs in a letter of Wotton to the Queen, I find the first notice of the afterwards active and in triguing Randolph. \" Postscripta. I have received,\" says he \" a letter from a scholar of"], [476, "444 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Paris, named Thomas Randall, who writeth thus : ' Thomas Stafford took his ship on Easter-day, at night. There are gone with him more French than of our nation. He went in the Flower de Luce, whereof is captain John Rybande, and another ship with him laden with artillery.' Thus far writeth the said Randall. * * The voice is at Dieppe,that they go into Scotland, which I believe not well.\" We see here how soon Randolph began to show his talents as a diplomatic spy. VIII. Cardan and the Bishop of St. Andrew's. History, p. 66. This celebrated and eccentric physician, who was brought to Scotland to cure the Scottish primate, gives us a few particulars of his journey, in his amusing work \u2014 \" De Vita Propria.\" Unfortu nately he is very brief, and more communicative on the extent of his fees, than the state of the country. He calls the primate Amulthon (Hamilton), and declares that after his case (a kind of periodic asthma) had defied the skill of the physicians of the limperor, and the French King, he made the Bishop smack whole in twenty four hours. \" Intra xxiv. horas nullo vel plane levi remedio liber abatur.\" He came to Edinburgh on the 3rd of June, and remained till the 13th of September. He returned to Italy January, 1523. His mode of cure, as described by Randolph in the following extract from one of his letters to Cecil \u00a3l5th January, 1561-2, MS. State Paper Office], was not quite so simple as Cardan himself would have us believe. He sinks the \" young whelps, and hanging the poor prelate by the heels.'' \" I will be bold,\" says Randolph, \" to trouble your Honour a little with a merry tale. Cardanus, the Italian, took upon him the cure of the Bishop of St. Andrew's, in a disease that to all other men was judged desperate and incurable. He practised upon him divers foreign inven tions : he hung him certain hours in the day by the heels, to cause him to avoid at the mouth that the other ways nature could not expel : he fed him many days with young whelps : he used him some times with extreme heats, and as many days with extreme colds. Before his departure, he roundeth for the space of six days, every"], [477, "PROOFS AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 445 day certain unknown words in his ears, and never used other medi cine after. It is said that at that time he did put a devil within him, for that since that, he hath been ever the better, and that this devil was given him on credit but for nine years, so that now the time is near expired, that either he must go to hell with his devil, or fall again into his old mischief, to poison the whole country with his false practices.\" IX. Power and License of the Nobles in Scotland, History, p. 7S. In England, during the reigns of Henry the VIII, Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth, the power of the Sovereign over the nobles, and the in fluenceof the wishes of the Crown, was infinitely greater than in Scot land during the same period. In Scotland the nobles lived in what Sir Ralph Saddler denominates in his despatches, \" a beastly liberty.\" They reasoned and acted for themselves, they looked to the course which they thought promised best for the country, or for their own interest ; and the idea of following this, in opposition to the com mands of the Crown, was familiar to them ; nay, not only this, but they often contemplated the idea of compelling the Sovereign to follow their wishes. The different feelings of the nobles in the two countries are strongly marked in the following letter of Mr. Thomas Martyn to Mary, Queen of England, dated at Carlisle, 11th June. 1557- [MS. State Paper Office.] After alluding to their conferences on the borders, he goes on to state a conversation between the Earls of Westmoreland and Cas sillis, in these terms : \u2014 \" My Lord of W. sayeth to th' Erie of Cassillis in this wise : My Lord, I think it but folly for us to treat now together, we having broken with France, and ye being French for your lives : Nay, by the messe, quoth the Earl of Cassillis, I am no more French than you are a Spaniard : Marry, quoth my Lord of Westmoreland, as long as God shall preserve my master and mistress together, I am, and shall be a Spaniard, to the utmost of my power : By God, quoth the Earl of Cassillis, so shall not I be French : And I told ye once in my Lord, your father's, house, in King Henry the VIII. his time, that we would dye, every mother's"], [478, "446 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. son of us, rather than be subjects until England ; even the like will ye find us to keep with France ; and I may tell you there are seven hundred Gascons arrived at Dumbryton, more than we will be known to you of ; which were sent to serve in the borders here, but we would not let them pass the river, and they being allowed but threepence a day, have so scattered abroad, that three hundred of them be licked up by the way, sic (such) is the favor that our men beareth unto the Frenchmen here. My Lord of Durham telleth me that the Bishop of Orkney ministered talk unto him to this effect, wishing in any wise restitution to be made of both parties equally, whereby the amity might be preserved betwixt us, notwith standing the French. Mr. Makgill told Mr. Henmar there was no cause why they should break with us, though we broke with France, for the Emperor's wars with the French empeacheth not our legal amity with the Emperor. Likewise Mr. Carnegy gave me his faith as a christian man, and honour of a Scottish knisht, that his mistress meant the like, marry, for saving his oath, he added at th' end, as far as we yet ken.\" X. Coalition between the Lord James and the Queen Dowager. Some new particulars regarding this coalition mentioned in the text ( History, p. 79), may be gathered from a letter of Lord Whar ton to the Lords of the Council, [MS. State Paper Office, 13th November, 1557]. It gives an account of a secret meeting which he had with William Kirkaldy, of Grange. He, (says Lord Wharton alluding to Kirkaldy,) saith, \" that the Prior of St. Andrew's, who is accounted the wisest of the late King's base sons, and one of the Council of Scot land, the Earl of Glencairn, and the Bishop of Caithness, did agree to write the letters in the Pacquet, and that the Dowager ]\u00b0s of Council, and consenting therewith, and that she wrote her letters to Mr. Dosell, to cause Kirkaldy make devise to send the letters to me, that they might pass in haste\u2014 and that the Dowager's letter did meet Dosell beside Dunbar, towards Edinburgh, the 13th of this month. Dosell returned (sent back) Kirkaldy upon the si^ht of the Dowager's letter, with the pacquet forthwith, who saith\" to"], [479, "PROOFS AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 447 me, it is the Queen and Dosell's device, and Dosell very earnest therewith, with many words that he hath given to Kirkaldy of the great displeasure that the Queen and Dosell beareth, especially against the Duke Chattelherault and the Earl of Huntly, and against others whom Dosell nameth, the feeble and false noblemen of Scotland. Amongst others, he said, when their army retired, and their ordnance was to be carried on the water, Dosell sent word to the Duke that he would see the ordnance returned over the water again, and that it might be put in safety. The messengers .said to the Duke that Dosell was angry with their retire, and breach of their promise, and also not regarding the safety of their ordnance. The Duke's answer was, let Monsieur Dosell gang by his mind, an he will, for as we, the noblemen of Scotland, have determined and written to the Queen, so will we do, and let him look to his own charge, and so was Dosell left. Upon which words, and their man ner of dealing, Dosell will seek their displeasure by all the ways and means he can, and so will the Dowager do also as Kirkaldy saith. \" In talk with him, I said it was a great matter to enterprise, to bring into that realm my Lady Margaret Lennox, and my Lord, her husband \u2014 that it required power of noblemen, with others, and houses of strength. He said, the coming of my Lady to the Dow ager with their friends there, would order that matter; and said, they might first have the Castel of Tantallon, which is in the keeping of the Laird of Craiguiillar; and at the Dowager's order. He speaketh liberally that they would have many friends, and also have on their side the authority that now is. This matter, as I think in my poor opinion, may be wrought for my Lady Margaret and my Lord of Lennox, and to continue the displeasure, now standing amongst the greatest of that realm.\" Kirkaldy goes on to propose a truce, as introductory to a peace, Wharton answered the Scots only pretended an anxiety for a truce when it suited themselves, and broke it when they pleased ; but should it be entertained, whom would he propose to send ? Kirkaldy said, the Lord Seaton, Captain Sarlabarosse, who had been one before, the Laird of Craigmillar, and the young Laird of Lething ton, or two of them. These are the Dowager's, and great with her. He said Scotland would agree to an abstinence for twenty days or for two months, but they must have a licence for an especial man to pass"], [480, "448 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. through England, and communicate with the French King. Whar ton asked the news. He said on Sunday last, 7th November, arrived a ship at Leith, with letters and money from the French King. He had seen a letter from the French King to Dosell, in which it was said he should have all his desires of men and money. That four ensignes, twelve hundred foot, and two hun dred horse, were dispatched to come into Scotland by the West Seas, and daily looked for. It is not unimportant to notice (on account of the light it throws on the character of the Lord James, afterwards the Regent Murray) that we here find him, Kirkaldy of Grange, Glencairn, and the Bishop of Caithness, acting with the Queen Dowager against Huntly, Chastelherault, and Argile. We find them receiving money from the French King, and stipulating for the presence of a French army in Scotland. Kirkaldy has generally been repre sented as a mirror of chivalry. Consistency certainly was not his fort. In a letter of Wotton (see Supra, p. 442), dated 1st March, 1556-7, he is determined on putting down all French influence in Scotland, here we find him, nine months after, inviting a French army into that country, and subsequently, in 1559, he returned to his first opinion. [\\See this Vol. p. 129.] XI. Letters and Papers of Knox. Not a few original letters of Knox are preserved in the Stale Paper Office, besides various public papers in his hand-writing, and evidently his composition. Of these, some appear in his history, but often very incorrectly printed, many words being altered, and parts entirely omitted. Others are to be found in the MS. Calderwood, in the British Museum. The letter quoted p. 137, and addressed to Percy, dated 1st July, 1559, which has not been printed com mences thus : \u2014 \" The mighty comfort of the Holy Ghost for salutation. Right Honourable, having the opportunity of this bearer unsuspect* I thought good to require of you such friendship, as that from time to time conference and knowledge might be betwixt us; I mean not myself and you, but betwixt the faithful of both these realms,"], [481, "PROOFS AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 449 to the end that inconveniences pretended against both, may by God's grace and mighty power be avoided. Your faithful friend, Mr. Kirkaldy, hath reported to me your gentle behaviour and faithful fidelity in all things lawful, honest, and godly. Continue this, and God by you, shall work more than now appeareth.\" Then follows the sentence quoted in this volume, p. 137, after which he concludes in these words \u2014 \" but all this had I rather communicate face to face, than commit to paper and ink. This other letter I have direct to Mr. Secretary, which, if your honour will cause to be de livered, I suppose you shall not offend him. Other things I have, which now I cannot write for continual trouble hanging on my wicked carcase, by reason of this tumult raised against Christ Jesus in his (infancy). I pray you seek to know the mind of the Queen, and of the Council, touching our support if we be pursued by an army of Frenchmen, and let me be assured by advertisement reasonably. And thus committing you to the protection of the Om nipotent, I most heartily desire you to approve my love \u2014 enterprise \u2014and enterprise not altogether without deliberation, as the troubles of these times do suffer. \"From Edinburgh, the 1st of July, 1559, \" Your's to command in Godliness, \"John Knox.\" Knox's letter to Cecil, dated 12th July, 1559, is preserved in the State Paper Office in the original. It enclosed his celebrated apo logy to Elizabeth, and has been printed incorrectly and in a garbled state in his History p. 224. The postscript of the same letter, which has not been printed, is as follows : \u2014 \" After the scribbling of these former lines, came Mr. Whitlaw, of whom, after conference, I understood the match in which I have laboured ever since the death of King Edward, now to be opened unto you \u2014 God grant you and others wisdom with humility. Immediately after Mr. Whitlaw, came a servant from Sir Harry Percy to Mr. Kirkaldy, who, departing from us at Edinburgh to speak, the said Sir Harry brought news to the hearts of all joyful, whensoever they shall be divulgat. It was thought expedient to communicate the matter only with those that are strongest, till far ther knowledge of the Queen's Majesty's good mind towards this VOL.

We doubt not the good mind of the whole congregation, which is great, as I doubt not but by others you will understand, but it is not thought expedient that so weighty a matter be un timeously disclosed. True and faithful preachers in the north parts cannot but greatly advance this cause. If a learned and godly man might be appointed to Berwick, with license also to preach within Scotland, I doubt not, but to obtain unto him the hands of the most part of the gentlemen of the east borders. Advert one thing, sir, that if the hearts of the Borderers of both parts can be united together in God's fear, our victory shall be easy. The fear of no man, I trust, this day to cause any of those that have professed themselves enemies to superstition within Scotland, to lift their hand against England, so long as it will abide in the purity of Christ's doctrine. Continual labours oppressing me, (most unable for the same) I am compelled to end with imperfection. The source of all wisdom rule your heart to the end. \"So much I reverence your judgment, that I will ye first see my letter, or ye deliver it, and therefore I send it open. Read and present it if ye think meet.\" At the same time that the Lords of the Congregation addressed to Cecil the letter mentioned in the text, p. 142, as written and composed by Knox, the same indefatigable man prepared for them a letter to the Queen. It is dated Edinburgh, 19th July, 1559, and as it has never been printed, I subjoin it here from the original, in the State Paper Office, and in Knox's hand writing, and signed by the principal leaders of the Congregation. Lords of the Congregation to Queen Elizabeth. \" Right mighty, right high, and right excellent Princess, with our most humill commendations unto your Majesty.

And that no member of the Congregation shall be troubled for religion, or any other cause dependant thereupon in body, lands, or goods, and that their ministers shall have full liberty not only to preach, but also lo ministrate the sacraments, publickly and privately at they think good, without trouble or impediment to be made to them by the Queen, or any other, openly or quietly. And also that no band or bands of men of war, French, Scots, or others, shall be laid, nor remain within the town of Edinburgh. There fore the said Lords of Congregation has thought good to notify the said, by this present proclamation, to all whom effeirs, and especially to their brethren of the Congregation now within this town, certi fiand them, and promising faithfully if any of the forsaid points be violated or broken, that the said Lords of the Congregation will in that case fortify, concur, and assist with their whole power and substance, as they have done in times bygane, to the reformation thereof, supporting of their brethren, relieving of every member of the true Congregation that shall be open to be invaded or molested. And to the furthering of God's glory upon their honours, and as they will answer therefore in presence of Eternal God. \" Proclaimed by voice of trumpet at the Market Cross of Edin burgh, the day aforesaid.\"1 Not only did the Lords of the Congregation, as stated in this volume, (p. 153) address their remonstrances to Cecil, but Knox directed to the same minister a vigorous letter, dated at St. An drew's, 15thAugust, 1559.

Sib Ralph Sadler's Instructions. These Instructions, mentioned in this volume, p. 150, are preserved in the State Paper Office, and are endorsed in Cecil's hand, 8th August, 1559, Sir Ralff Saddler. They are important in the strong light they throw upon Elizabeth's policy towards Scotland, and as they have not been printed, I subjoin them here. \" Memorial of things to be imparted lo the Queen's Majesty \u2014 The matter of Mr. Sadler. \" First That he understand how the proceedings there differ"], [486, "454 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. from our intelligences here, and thereafter to proceed either the quicklyer or the slower. \" Item. \u2014 The principal scope shall be to nourish the faction be twixt the Scots and the French, so that the French may be better occupied with them, and less busy with England. The means whereby may be those as follow, beside such as Mr. Sadler of him self shall think meet. First, to provoke all such as have stirred in the last assembly, to require the Queen Regent to perform her pro mise, both for restoring of religion, and sending away the French men, and to persuade them, that altho' they may be reconciled with promises or rewards, yet shall they never be trusted by the Frenchmen. \" Item. \u2014 To procure that the Duke may for preservation of the expectant interest which he hath to the crown, if God call the young Queen before she have issue, instantly withstand the govern ance of that realm by any other than by the blood of Scotland. Like as the King of Spain, being husband to the Queen of England, committed no charge of any manner of office, spiritual or temporal, to any stranger, neither doth he otherwise, nor his father before him, in his countries of Flanders, Brabant, or any other, but suf fereth them to be governed wholly by their own nation. In this point, if the Duke mean to preserve his title, ought he to be earnest ; for otherwise he may be assured that the French under pretence of subduing of religion, will also subdue the realm, and exstirpe his house. \" Item \u2014 If this may be compassed, then may the nobility of Scotland also require of their Queen, that lo avoid such mortal wars and bloodshed as hath been betwixt England and Scotland, there might be a perpetual peace made betwixt both these realms, so as no invasions should be made by either of them by their fron tiers, and for the answer of an objection which may be made to disturb this purpose, it may be well said, that altho' the Scottish Queen do falsely pretend title to the crown of England, yet doth she it, but as descended from the blood of England, that is to say, of the body of King Henry the VII, whereunto none of Scotland either doth or can make pretence, and therefore none ought to be abused by any of such persuasion. \" Item. The Duke may pretend as good cause to arrest Monsieur D'Oysell or some other of the French, as for answering for his two"], [487, "PROOFS AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 455 sons, the Earl, and the L. David, as the French have done, in driving away the one and imprisoning the other, being neither of them his subjects nor offenders against him. \" Item. It shall do well to explore the very truth whether the Lord James do mean any enterprize towards the crown of Scotland for himself or no, and if he do, and the Duke be found very cold in his own causes, it shall not be amiss to let the Lord James follow his own device therein, without dissuading or persuading him any thing therein. \" Item. Finally, if he shall find any disposition in any of them to rid away the French there, he may well accelerate the same, with this persuasion, that if they tarry until the aid come out of France, they shall find these to abide longer than they would.\" XIII. Intelligence from Scotland. The paper quoted in this volume, p. 173, under the title \" Intelli gence out of Scotland,\" contains the Journal of one of Cecil's numerous spies. \u2014 It is dated and marked with his own hand, and although its information is not implicitly to be relied on, it fur nishes us with some curious details. Intelligence out of Scotland, the 10th Nov. 1559- First, the Earl Bothwell, the Lord Borthwick, and the Lord Season, are with the Queen Dowager, of Scotland, and taketh a plain part with her, and no other noblemen of Scotland. All the rest of the noblemen of Scotland taketh part with the Governor of Scotland. \"The Governor's eldest son, the Earls of Argile, Huntly, Glen cairn, the Lord Revill (Ruthven), the Prior of St. Andrew's, the Mr. of Maxwell, the Lord of Livingston (Lethington), are made Regents of the realm of Scotland by the congregation, to have the governance of the same realm until they have a righteous Prince amongst them; the which Regents with their trains came to Edin burgh the 23d day of October last with twelve thousand men with them, and sat in Council, and there deprived the said Queen Dowager of all rule in Scotland, for that she did not keep promises with them, nor follow the counsel of the nobility of Scotland, for the weal of the realm and the liberty of the same."], [488, "456 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. \"At the coming of the said Lords to Edinburgh, the Queen, with her party, being three thousand French and four hundred Scots, removed to Leith. \" The last of October last past, in the night, the Earl Bothwell, accompanied with twenty-four men, met the Lord of Ormeston accompanied with six men, about Haddington, and there took from him six thousand crowns sterling, which the said Lord was carrying to the Governor, and hurt the same Lord upon the face with a sword sore ; that he lieth upon the same at his house of Ormeston. \" The advertisements of the taking of the same money came to the Governor, who sent his eldest son, the Mr. of Maxwell, the Prior of St. Andrew's and others, being seven hundred men or thereabout, to the Castle of Crichton, the Earl Bothwell's chief house, distant from Edinburgh eight miles, who entered into the same, and put garrison into it upon Allhallows-day, and lay that night there, and came to Edinburgh on the morrow. \" Upon Allhallows-day, after the riding forth of the said Gover nor, his son, and the others, the same was declared to the Queen by a servant of the Bishop of Dumblain, and immediately after the same declaration, about one thousand five hundred French and Scotsmen, issued out of Leith, and skirmished with about 11 c. (eleven hundred) Scotsmen that had laid two pieces of great ordnance upon a little hill beside Holyrood House, to shoot at Leith, and the Frenchmen won the one piece, and the other was bursted. And the same Frenchmen entered into Canon gate, and spoiled the same to the port of the town, and slew twenty-one Scotsmen and three women, and six Frenchmen were slain at the same skirmish. And forty men of arms of France rode in at the Port, and went almost to the tron, where they were put back by the Governor and his party. The Castle of Edinburgh shot two canons at the French party at the said skirmish, for the which the Queen reproved the Lord Erskine, who made answer, that he would shoot at any person that went about to annoy the town of Edinburgh. \" The 3d of November present, the Governor sent his son and the Mr. of Maxwell with three hundred horsemen to Crighton Castle, who, at their arrival there, sent to the Earl Bothwell, being"], [489, "457 PROOFS AND ILLUSTRATIONS. at the Castle of Borthwick, and willed him to come and take part with the Lords, which he refused to do, and then the Governor's son spoiled the Castle of Crichton, and had the spoil, and all his evidents to the Governor. \" The 4th November aforesaid, the Queen sent to the Lords, and moved them to quietness, saying, she would keep all promises with them, if they would do the like, whereunto they would not agree, saying, they had found her so false and unnatural, that they would never trust her, nor have to do with her nor France, but by the sword. \" The 6th November instant, the Congregation and the French skirmished together, at which was slain Alexander Halyburton, brother to the tutor of Pitcur, one of the best Captains of Scot land, and thirty footmen of Scotland, and divers taken, and of the French six or seven slain and six taken. The Lords of Scotland perceiving that their skirmishes chanced not well with them, and that they were not in a perfect readiness for the wars ; put all the ordnance in Edinburgh Castle upon band of the Lord Erskine, to have the same safely delivered to them again, and the said 6th of November about midnight removed to Lithgow, where they re mained in consultation and preparing for the wars, and will set up a coin, saying they shall coyne a good part of their plate for maintenance of the word of God, and the wealth of Scotland. \"The morrow next after, being the 7th of Nov., the Queen re moved to Edinburgh about ten of the clock before noon, where she remaineth, having all things there at her will; the most part of the inhabitants of Edinburgh fled out of the town with bag and baggage before her coming hither, and put a great part of their best stuff in Edinburgh Castle for the safety thereof. The Bishops of St. Andrew's and Glasgow are with the Queen, and the Bishops of the Out Isles and Galloway with the Lor3s and Congregation. XIV. Treaty of Berwick. At the time of the Treaty of Berwick, described in this volume pp. 183, 184, Cecil sent queries to the Scottish Lords, to which he required them to make definite answers. \u2014 The following paper preserved in the State Paper Office, contains these questions and"], [490, "458 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. the replies It is endorsed in Cecil's hand, 20th Feb. 1559, and is in the hand, writing of Sir R. Sadler. Certain Questions proponed to the Lords of Scotland, answered and resolved by them. 1. Whether they be able of themselves to resist the French power, and expel them out of Scotland. Answer. \u2014 In respect of the fortresses which the French occupied in the time the Queen Dowager bare rule, and yet do possess, we are not able without the Queen's Majesty's support to expel them, seeing the whole body of the realm is not as yet united. Question. \u2014 What aid then is required ? Answer. \u2014 They require England to join with Scotland in league to expel these their enemies, and promise on their part to unite with England at all times against her enemies, and refer the spe cialty of the aid to herself. Question. \u2014 What power, horse and foot can they levy, and how soon ? Answer We would be able to bring five thousand men into the field, of which two thousand should watch and ward in company with the English soldiers according to the rate of their number, and with the other three thousand we shall keep the country in obedi ence, and make them be sure on all sides, night and day ; that they shall need to attend upon nothing, saving the French within the fort, aud we shall meet their army at Acheson's Haven, the 25th day of March next coming. Question. \u2014 How long they be able to abide and continue in the field ? Answer. \u2014 The whole nobility and landed men, with their house holds, shall remain continually, so long as the Queen's Majesty's power shall remain, how loDg soever it be, and the remanent num ber the space of twenty days after the meeting and joining of both the armies, upon their own charges, and at the end of the said twenty days, shall have in readiness two thousand footmen, or thereby to receive wages of the Queen's Majesty, and continue so 1 Scots Coir. 20th Feb. 1559."], [491, "PROOFS AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 459 long as need shall be, and three or four hundred light horsemen, if it be thought convenient in like manner to receive wages. And as to the number of the nobility, landed men, and their households, which shall remain after the said twenty days, it shall be declared unto you before the end of the said twenty days, that you may be assured what you shall trust to. Question. \u2014 What ordnance for battery, and what munition can they bring ? Answer. \u2014 It is not unknown to you that all the artillery and munition of Scotland, is in the hands of the Queen, and the French, and (in) the strengths that are not in our hands. Question. \u2014 What carriages can they furnish for the transport of great ordnance ? Answer. \u2014 The artillery '.and draught gear being brought to Acheson's Haven by sea, the lack of carriage horses supplied from thence to Leith. Question. \u2014 What number of pioneers they can help us with ? Answer. \u2014 We believe assuredly, that on the Queen's Majesty's charges, we shall levy three or four hundred, or more if need be. Question. \u2014 What necessaries they have for scaling and assault ing of forts ? Answer. \u2014 They have none in store, but whatsoever is in the country will be at their command ; and there is wood and broom enough within four miles of Leith. Question. \u2014 How they can furnish the army with victuals for horse and men ? Answer. \u2014 Plenty of oats for horses ; as to forage, they cannot say much till they see how far the country is destroyed ; as to men, Commissaries with a convenient sum of money should be sent into Scotland, to buy up victuals, of which there will be plenty. There is arrested in merchants' hands in Dundee, two hundred tuns of wine, which will be delivered into the Commissaries' hands for thirty-four pounds Scottish the tun, viz. eight pounds ten shillings sterling. Question. \u2014 Where and when their power and ours shall join together ? Answer. \u2014 It shall be the greatest ease for us to meet you in some"], [492, "460 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. part of Lothian where ye think good, but always we reserve that to your discretion. Question. \u2014 Are they able to take and occupy Edinburgh ? What as to the Lord Erskine ? Answer. \u2014 It is too great a hazard to attempt Edinburgh before the joining of the armies, because we doubt the French as desperate men will enterprise a battle. As to Lord Erskine, they will pro mise nothing assuredly, but hope he will be no enemy. Question. \u2014 How the borderers in Scotland may be reduced to take part with the said Lords in this cause ? Answer. \u2014 They are labouring presently, and are in good hope to reduce the most part of them thereto, for the obstinate they will take order as you may advise. Question. \u2014 What number of ships for the warrs ? Answer. \u2014 No great number at their command, but there are some which will make forth against the French at their own adventure. Question. \u2014 Where they shall be able to lodge in towns together, six hundred demi lances and six-hundred light horsemen ? Answer. \u2014 They shall he placed in Edinburgh, if it may be had, failing thereof in [towns thereabouts, the most commodious to be left to them in all sorts. Question. \u2014 Where we may best land our artillery and muni tion ? Answer. \u2014 At Acheson's Haven, there is good hard ground from thence to Leith. XV. Letters of the Lord James, afterwards Regent Murray.1 The Lord James St. Andrew's, to Sir William Cecil. \" Right Honourable Sir, \u2014 After all loving commendation.

Since my returning from my Lord of Huntly, which was the 1st of this instant, I have been continually travelling in the towns here upon the sea coast for pre paration of victuals against the arrival of the commissaries, and also upon the preparation of our folks, assuring ourselves of meeting 1 MS.

This nobleman, perhaps the most powerful Baron in Scotland, has been somewhat undeservedly lauded. Like his brethren, he"], [495, "PROOFS AND 1LLUSTRAT[8ns. 463 was crafty, selfish, and ambitious. The following letter from his brother, the Bishop of Caithness, and the interesting paper which follows it, disclose his secret transactions with the Lords of the Congregation, and throw light on the severity with which he was afterwards treated by Mary. Letter from A. Gordon to the Duke of Norfolk. \" After hearty commendations to your Grace, it will please you to wit, that in consideration of the relation made by the Queen Dowager to divers of your Grace's countrymen, quha spak her in the Castle of Edinburgh, that my Lord my brother, the Earl of Huntly, would by no way assist or concur with us in defence of this our common and godly action, I will be so bold, with your Grace's pardon, to assure you of the contrary.

At which time, in this as in all others, he shall be satisfied.\" XVII. An Irish Ambassador in 1560. The following extract from a letter, addressed by Randolph to Cecil, is amusing, in the vivid portrait it gives us of O'Neil's Ambas sador \u2014 and in showing also that the Irish language was written and understood by the inhabitants of the North of Scotland, as late at least as August 25, 1 560, the date of this letter. It is preserved in the State Paper Office. \" May it please you to understand, that the l6th of this present, there came to the Earl of Argile, out of Ireland, an Ambassador from O'Neil. What was his message, and effect of his embassy, your Honour may perceive by these letters which the Earl of Ar gile hath sent, beside also some other matter that he requireth to be advertised of from your Honour as you see time. The letter that he received from O'Neill, he caused to be translated into English, and hath, notwithstanding, sent you the original, ad faciendam majorem fidem, and also for you to see the strangeness of their orthography.

Mary's aversion to Knox. The following extract from a letter of Throckmorton 's to Queen Elizabeth, dated 13th July, 1561, Paris, and preserved in the French Correspondence of the State Paper Office, evinces the strong aversion which the young Queen of Scots had conceived against this reformer, previous to her arrival in her dominions. \" The said Queen's (Scotland) determination to go home conti nues still ; she goeth shortly from the Court to Fescamp, in Nor mandy, there to make her mother's funerals and burial, and from thence to Calais, there to embark. * * The late unquietness in Scotland hath disquieted her very much, and yet stayeth not her journey.

It appears from the following letter of Lethington to Cecil, dated at Edinburgh, 15th August, 156l, that the English Queen had so far suffered herself to be overcome by passion, as openly to declare to D'Oysell that she would not suffer his mistress to come into her own dominions. \" Sir, \u2014 Hither came yesternight from France a Scottish gentle man called Capt. Anstruther, sent by the Queen, our Sovereign, who left her Maj : (as he saith) at Morin, six leagues from the Court at St. Germain's, where she had left the King, and was coming towards Calais there to embarque. He hath letters to the most part of the noblemen, whereby she doth complain that the Queen's Majesty not only hath refused passage to Monsieur Doy sell and the safe conduct which she did courteously require for herself, but also doth make open declaration that she will not suf fer her to come home to her own realm, yet is her affection such towards her country, and so great desire she hath to see us, that"], [502, "470 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. she meaneth not for that threatening to stay, but taketh her jour ney with two galleys only without any forces, accompanyed with her three uncles, the Duke D'Aumall, the Marquis d'Elboef, and the Great Prior, one of the constable's sons, Monsieur Damville, and their trains, and so trust her person in our hands. In the meantime thinking that the Queen's Maj : will by some means practique the subjects of this realm, she hath written to divers, and specially those whom she knoweth most affectioned, to continue the intelligence, willing them in anywise that they receive no Am bassador from her Majesty, nor renew any league with her High ness unto such time as she be present with us, the bearer sayth that she will arrive before the 26th day of this instant. What this message meaneth I cannot judge, I marvel that she will utter any thing to us, which she would have kept close for you, and if two galleys may quietly pass, I wish the passport had been liberally granted. To what purpose should you open your pack and sell none of your wares, or declare you enemies to those whom you cannot offend. It passeth my dull capacity to imagine what this sudden enterprise should mean. We have determined to trust no more than we shall see, yet can I not but fear the issue for lack of charges and sufficient power. If any thing chance amiss, we shall feel the first dint, but I am sure you see the consequence. It shall be well done that the Q. Maj : keep some ordinary power at Berwick, of good force, so long as we stand in doubtful terms, as well for safety of the peace as our comfort. The neighbourhood of your men. will discourage our enemies and make us the bolder. My wit is not sufficient to give advice in so dangerous a cast, but I mean well. God maintain his cause, and those that mean up rightly. I pray you send me your advice what is best to be done, as well in the common cause, as in my particular, who am taken to be a chief meddler and principal negociator of all the practiques with that Realm, tho' I be not in greatest place, yet is not my dan ger least, specially when she shall come home, having so late received at the Q.

As an example of Lethington 's lighter epistolary style, the Reader may be interested in the following letter, written to Cecil when the Scottish Secretary was in love with Mary Fleming, one of the Queen's Marys, whom he afterwards married. It is amusing to find that he had chosen so grave a confidant as Cecil. There is preserved in the British Museum, a pathetic letter of this Mary Fleming, written to Lord Burleigh, intreating him to use his influence with Morton, that the body of Lethington, her husband, might suffer no shame. It has been printed by Chalmers, from the original in the Cotton collection \u2014 Life of Mary, vol. ii. p. 502. Ledington to Cecil.1 Sir \u2014 I have of late been somewhat perplexed, understanding that you were sick, the rather that I could not have certain knowledge whether it was the cough which universally did reign, or other more dangerous disease, which did trouble you. I am glad to hear by the report of such as come from hence that you have recovered your health, and yet will not be fully assured thereof, until such time as I shall see the same testified by some letter, written with your own hand. I am not tarn cupidus rerum novarum, that I desire any change, and if my fortune should be at any time to come 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off.

I confess I have found in you some lacks, and points which I have wished to be reformed, and shall still find so long as you do not fully satisfy my affections ( such is the nature of man and phylantye (<pi\\atrix) which maketh us fancy too much our own conceptions.) Yet, I do not look for any full reformation of you in that behalf, and not the less when I do indifferently and with out passion behold your proceedings, and even such as I appear most to mislike, I am constrained to think, that if any other occu pied the same place, I might, perhaps, have matter ministered unto me of more misliking. Therefore, how far soever I mislike you, I wish you to do well to yourself, and suffer neither the evil weather, nor evil world kill you. As there are in you many good parts, which I require in myself, so I find in me one great virtue, whereof for your commodity I wish you a portion, to wit, the common affairs do never so much trouble me, but that at least I have one merry hour of the four and twenty, and you labour continually without intermission, nothing considering that the body, yea, and the mind also, must sometime have recreation, or else they cannot long last. Such physic as I do minister unto myself, I appoint for you. Marry, you may, perhaps, reply, that as now the world doth go with me, my body is better disposed to digest such than yours is, (for those that be in love, are ever set upon a merry pin) yet I take this to be a most singular remedy for all diseases in all persons. You see how I abuse my leisure, and do trouble your occupations with matters of so light moment. It is not for lack of a more grave subject, but that I purposely forbear it, not knowing in what sort, I may touch it, and avoid offence. I will, with better devotion, look for other matter in your next letter, than for any answer to this foolish letter of mine, and yet, rather to be advertised of your convalescence. You ran impart those news to none that will be more glad of them. Like as if you will command any thing that lieth in my power conveni ently to do, you will find none next your son, over whom you have more authority.

Characteristic Letter of Knox. The following letter of this Reformer (alluded to in this volume, p. 343) is addressed to Randolph, and dated at Edinburg 3d 1564. Some few words are unreadable, but as a whole, it is very characteristic. \" Both your's are come to my hands, with your for the which I heartily thank you.

My Lord Bothwell shall follow with power to put in execution whasoever is demanded, and our Sovereign will have done, and then shall Knox and his preaching be pulled by the ears.

Some in this country look for the Lady and the young Earl, or it be long; it is whispered to me that license is already procured for their hither coming.
