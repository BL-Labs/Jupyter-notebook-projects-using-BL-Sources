While the destinies of the second Miss Mar rynett were thus satisfactorily arranged for, those of the eldest young lady of the family (if she could be allowed the privilege of being called so) were seemingly as completely disposed of, by less authorized weavers at the ever-whirring loom of mortal fate. Of course the Souchongs discussed the events of the christening festivity over the first meal at which they formed a rejunction \u2014 breakfast, the next day \u2014 in no very satisfied style.

Mrs. Mar rynett's airs had always been insupportahle, but now they were really past all bearing ! Sh evidently tried to insult her before all the com pany, though her guest ! It was not her fault, surely, she had seen a little decent society in London, and had been presented at court, on Sir John's account, that she was to be continually sneered at about it !

And the good lady, who proved a case in point that nothing is"], [11, "CUPID AND CUPIDITY. 3 sourer than sour milk, added with the utmost bitterness of asperitv, \" I am sure I wish she had had nothing but boys, too, if that would have kept the woman in some sort of decent temper ; and, besides, did ever anybody see such a stuck up, conceited set of creatures as all the Marry nett girls are, one and all, with the exception of that stupid, blushing, overgrown school-girl, Toby was going to marry ?\" \" Don't you talk against my ' Bet,' mother ! I won't allow anyone but myself, when once she's bone of my bone \u2014 or bane of my bane \u2014 as country people say, and townspeople mostly find it.

Do stick to the ' court' in preference, though it's quite true you have bored everyone to death with that, long ago. I don't wonder at Mrs. Marrynett \u2014 only I know she meant it maliciously, and is as great, or a greater fool, the same way \u2014 don't be vexed, mother, I only mean : \" ' 'Tis a pity when charming women Talk of what they don't understand !'

This conviction it was that prepared for Mr. Marrynett the great surprise and discomfiture, in this particular instar.ce, of having his cwn way given him ! He expected, doubtless, that his receding from what had previously been a sine qua non with Mr. Tobias Souchong, in the matrimonial ar rangement entered upon between the families, would be insisted upon by that young, but rapa cious bargainer in a degree that would allow him to back not altogether discreditably out of the whole affair. He had made up his mind like a rock on the point, and had more than half en gaged for success with his consort, willing to sooth her on all such collaterals as he could, without yielding on any of his own determined purposes in chief."], [18, "10 CUPID AND CUPIDITY. Mr. Marrynett therefore no longer shunned a tete-a-tete with his stipulated son-in-law, and beheld him enter his private office shortly after his arrival, almost with unusual cheerful ness. \" Take a stool, Souchong, and a chop and a pint of stout with me to-day ? I mean to lunch early and home early. Will do you good ; put a little blood in your cheek. Knocked up, I suppose, with the fun and speechifications yester day ? Now it quite did me good ; but you're not so strong. Not a country constitution like me. Though, by-the-by, I don't think you did much at things yesterday. Not half such a jolly dog as Tom, you're not. Tom's a very handsome fellow, too, by-the-by ; he'll look well in ridgementals, and his mother tells me Sir John means him for a soldier.

I don't care much about the sort of thing myself. I should much prefer to be a plain Liverpool mer chant, with plenty of money in my pocket,\" Tobias replied, labouring at the playful and un concerned. \" But, thank you, Mr. Marrynett, I can't do a chop yet. I haven't so strong a stomach, that's true, as my brother Tom, though I can't say I see his good looks so much as some people do, or pretend to ! I'll only detain you a moment, sir. But, as Miss Marrynett is now home from the finishing- school, and all I can possibly desire in every way, I was merely going to say that, with your kind permission and sanction, of course, as arranged, I mean to make my proposals to your daughter, sir, in proper form at once, and hope, with your in fluence, I may promise myself a favourable re sult to the application.\" Mr. Marrynett was silent for a moment, stroking his chin, and avoiding the sharpened, foxy eyes fixed upon him. He then said : \" Well, Souchong, to be sure. All right ! You understanding, of course \u2014 both of us per-"], [20, "12 CUPID AND CUPIDITY. fectly agreed \u2014 on the modifications circum stances, since we last talked on the subject, have introduced into the toot-ensamble?\" the last words pronounced as English, as if they had been so. \" WThat modifications, sir ? I am not aware \" \" Didn't you hear what I said yesterday ? How I considered everything of a monetary nature modified by the birth of my son, Mr. Souchong?\" \" How was I to understand that, sir ? That you had receded from your solemnly plighted word, Mr. Marrynett, if I would marry your eldest daughter, to admit me to a ten-thousand pound share in the business, and \" \"About the share in the business, sir, never ! I have had so much opposition of late from your father in his notions that I am determined his views shall not be strengthened by any addi tional weight in the house. And, besides, my plans in the disposal of my surplus capital are quite diametrically opposed to Sir John's specu lative tendencies in produce. It is my intention in future to embark in land, which is always"], [21, "13 CUPID AND CUPIDITY. a safe investment, for it can't run away, and is also essentially necessary, I may beg leave to observe, to my intentions and wishes to become a landed proprietor. Without which, I am quite satisfied now, it is impossible I shall ever get into Parliament as a county member, which the ungrateful and unparalleled behaviour of this dung-hill town, which I have done so much to raise to its present rank and luxuriance of growth, satisfies me I shall never otherwise ac complish.\" \" You are going into mines a good deal in deed, sir, which swallow money fast enough cer tainly,\" replied Tobias, with an uneasy internal reflection on the possible results that way, too. \" But I am sure my father and I agree as little as anybody in his notions of going in so much at tea. I am convinced there must be a reaction that way, too, shortly, and I have no desire to support his views in the house ; but if you do not wish the Souchong interest to be increased in it, at least I presume you intend to keep to the bargain regarding the twenty thousand pounds fortune for Miss Marrynett, in money. You repeated so, indeed, last night !\""], [22, "14 CUPID AND CUPIDITY. \" The twenty thousand pounds, Mr. Sou chong ! I only said ten; I only meant ten. I never said I would give Elizabeth more. I never will ; and it's a shocking injustice to her other sisters, too, whom I shall not be able to portion off at all until my death. There's no mistake about that ; I told every one that clearly enough yesterday, and I am sure your brother Tom, at all events, who is making himself so spoony on Adelaide, quite understood me!\" And Mr. Marrynett gave a triumphant scowd at the suitor, as much as to say, \"That will settle him !\" And, indeed, Tobias repeated with seemingly angry emphasis enough : \" Only ten thousand pounds, sir, after promising as good as twenty ! Your eldest daughter, and the granddaughter of a person who \u2014 of a person who \u2014 you know very well, Mr. Marrynett, it is not every Liver pool man of standing who \" \" I know exactly what you are going to say, Mr. Souchong !

If you"], [23, "CUPID AND CUPIDITY. 15 don't, I don't care. I shall never ask any one else at the same rate. If your notion is to marry my daughter for my money, I am much obliged to you ; but I shall be no party to the transaction. If I was going to buy her a hus band, I could \u2014 at all events, she could, I am pretty well sure, suit herself better. Now you clearly understand me, make up your own mind at your leisure, and let's say no more about it at present , for the ' Western Wave ' must be at tended to at once, and I've hardly any time before I am back again to see Mr. Pendragon about the great speculation in his mines !\" But while Mr. Marrynett was speaking, Tom Souchong was more profoundly reflecting, and ere he ceased to speak had \" made up his mind.\" He reflected, how his father's and mother's extravagance left them with no means to set up their eldest son suitably in a great way of busi ness of his own, while his father threatened to be of long life from the soundness of his consti tution, besides being still comparatively a young man. He remembered that he had several younger brothers, besides Tom, who was to be"], [24, "16 CUPID AND CUPIDITY. the soldier, and George Augustus, who was to be the parson \u2014 all in a way of being brought up to expensive professions, or to shares in his father's Marrynett two-fifths merely. He dis trusted the judgment of both his seniors in the firm, in the fanatic fancies they had of latter days displayed, one for cotton, the other for tea. Mr. Marrynett's new madness to found a family through his only son assured him it would be hopeless waiting to attain the supremacy in it, as husband of his eldest daughter. In spite of the amplest personal vanity, Mr. Souchong, having already sustained two refusals from wealthy merchants' daughters, could not flatter himself that he was irresistibly acceptable to the fair. But, strange to say, the master motive that impelled him in the course he now determined upon, was the visible repug nance of Elizabeth Marrynett towards her pre maturely wizened suitor. It was intolerable to his already wounded feelings of a personal de scription, that an ugly, awkward, friendless girl like Elizabeth Marrynett, whom he had for years made his derision and butt, should pre sume to return dislik and contempt for con-"], [25, "17 CUPID AND CUPIDITY. H /<s tempt and dislike, and repulse, as significantly as she dared, the attentions he at last deigned to bestow on her. To crown all, Tobias Souchong had the greatest confidence in his own abilities to make an enormous fortune, if he had only sufficient capital to start with, in conjunction with his own savings. The conclusion of the whole mental operation, therefore, was to the effect that \u2014 no, he needed no time to deliberate ! His heart and his affections were, unfortunately, but too much engaged in the affair ! For tunately, rather. Nothing conduced more to domestic happiness than mutual love, and he was happy to say it, and to believe it from the bottom of his soul, that the great affection he had shown ever since their arrangement was made towards Miss Marrynett, had won her kind and gentle nature to a \" reciprocal inter change,\" and that feeling certain that the hap piness of her whole life, as well as his own, was concerned in the matter, he decided, then and there, to accept the ten thousand pounds, marry the young lady, and relinquish his place in the counting-house of Marrynett, Souchong, and i vol. ii. 2"], [26, "18 CUPID AND CUPIDITY. Co., to start business for himself in the tea line exclusively. Mr. Marrynett stared \u2014 in fact, was for several moments petrified at this announcement \u2014 by which he found himself, as he believed, entan gled and secured hand and foot, in the coil of his own rope. \" Elizabeth fond \u2014 fond of you, Tobias ? You don't mean it, sure \u2014 ly !\" he gasped at last. \" How can it be? I thought \u2014 I had no reason to think certainly \u2014 what makes you think she has taken a fancy for you?\" \" Oh, we lovers know what we go upon, sir. We can't always explain it so easily to a third party.\" \" Why, you were always snarling and sneer ing at her when you was children, and since you've been a grown man, too ; and she did not like you one bit six months ago. She told me so herself.\" \" Six months ago is a long time in these affairs, sir,\" replied Tobias, flushing up with rage and consternation internally at what he heard ; \" and all that snarling and sneering, as you call it, were only signs of the notice we"], [27, "19 CUPID AND CUPIDITY. took of each other more than ordinary chil dren. And it has grown with our growth and strengthened with our strength \u2014 especially since I have entirely changed my conduct, and gone into love-making. Women always love a man that goes in for it heartily, as if he loved them ; and I do love Elizabeth, and she loves me \u2014 now. You can't want to break her heart, sir, certainly \u2014 after her poor mother's end, too, which I have always heard \u2014 I mean, Elizabeth is thought to take a great deal after her poor mother, in her silent, passionate way, like ; and nobody knows what disappointment might drive her on too.\" \" Good Lord, yes ! if Elizabeth really is fond of you. But only so late ago as yesterday at the christening \u2014 I shouldn't like her, that's true, to feel disappointed in life,\" said Mr. Mar rynett, quite shaken and surprised off his per pendicular, while Tobias impudently followed up the blow by declaring that if Mr. Marrynett would only continue his consent, and give him proper opportunities to urge his suit, he had not the slightest idea whatever but that Miss 2\u20142"], [28, "20 CUPID AND CUPIDITY Marrynett would be the happiest of the happy to become his bride. Mr. Marrynett, taken absolutely by surprise, vaguely apprehensive that the happiness of the daughter us an injured mother really was at stake \u2014 that, contrarily, there might be another and a worse danger of misalliance in store for him \u2014 ashamed to recede altogether unhand somely from his word, and yet with a hope that he might not be called to keep to it ; but, above all, conscious of the malignity of the poor girl's stepmother towards her absolutely requiring some effort to be made for her redemption. Mr. Marrynett, upon all these considerations, hurriedly adopted the solution of declaring that in that case \u2014 if Souchong really were sure of Elizabeth's affections being engaged to him \u2014 he would never be the man to go back from his promise so far as regarded the ten thousand pounds fortune for his eldest daughter. \" Elizabeth and I will make it all right, then, sir, this very evening, if I am allowed the oppor tunity,\" said the over-confident Tobias ; and Mr. Marrynett hurriedly assenting, at least so far as to say that Mr. Souchong knew he was"], [29, "21 CUPID AND CUPIDITY, always welcome to his house, and that Miss Marrynett was ordered now always to be in when there was company \u2014 the satisfactory in terview was drawn to a close. Not that Tobias Souchong felt quite so con fident as he declared himself. Still, an ugly, unnoticed, out-of-place, frightened girl like Elizabeth, who was already aware of an abso lute decree on her father's part as to her dis posal to him as a husband \u2014 would she, could she, resist the united force of all the agencies Tobias would now be enabled to put in action ? Among which he reckoned as by no means the least, the violent personal affection and devotion he was now determined to assume towards the object of his hopes \u2014 in some sense certainly. In pursuit of this latter preliminary it was that Mr. Souchong hit upon a very excel lent and artful contrivance indeed, to bring his suit again under the most favourable and flattering circumstances to the young lady's notice. Having briefly triumphed over his father by announcing that \" Old Marrynett\" had given in at last to let him have Elizabeth with ten"], [30, "22 CUPID AND CUPIDITY. thousand pounds to begin with, \" and it will be all we ever bargained for in the end,\" he said, \" I don't believe that tiny mite of his will ever live to cut its teeth, or, at all events, its first shake of hooping cough will finish it up,\" Mr. Souchong passed into an outer office among the ledger clerks, and called to him one specially by name. \" Segrave ! \u2014 I say, Mr. Segrave ! bring your folio this way, I want to see you about something \u2014 do you hear? My own room !\" Ringold Segrave, who had a mortal distaste for the insolent, domineering, and unfeelingly sarcastic little eldest son of his firm's second partner, on every possible account, had affected for a moment not to hear the summons. But a fellow-clerk repeated it, and he could no longer pretend to ignore. \" Yes, Mr. Souchong ; I'm at the bills of lading of the 'Mandarin' at present, and Sir John is rather in a hurry. Wouldn't Mr. Brown \u2014 coming, sir !\" \"Didn't I tell you I wanted you, Segrave ?\" said Tobias, banging the door of his private sanctum when the young man had reluctantly entered, with an immense sheepskin volume"], [31, "23 CUPID AND CUPIDITY. under his arm. \"But I didn't want you about business in reality \u2014 it was only a blind. Is not your mother housekeeper at Liverpool Palace ?\" Ringold was fairly taken aback at this ques tion ; he was excessively startled, in fact, and did not reply for some moments. \" What is found out?\" he thought to himself; and then, gathering up his courage, he replied in a rather singularly stern and determined accent \u2014 \"Yes, Mr. Souchong, she is.\" \" You needn't mouth my name so, Segrave. I know what it is by this time, I suppose, and you speak as if I was throwing it in your teeth about your mother being in service ; you can't help it on your salary, nor could I, or any one, if I had only sixty pounds a-year, and was obliged to live and dress up decently on it,\" Toby Souchong replied, with unwonted consi deration and condescension. \" I only asked you because I wanted you to do me a service through her. Of course, I know your mother is Mr. Marrynett's housekeeper ; don't you re member how I found you once sitting in her room, when I had that lark with Lucy, the"], [32, "24 CUPID AND CUPIDITY. housemaid, and you started up in such a way because you heard the little donkey scuffling about when I was going to give her the kiss ? Of course 1 know all that ; and I know besides that all women like nothing so much as carry ing on a courtship quite on the sly, and against almost the will and knowledge of their parents and guardians, etc., etc., etc. What are you looking so amazed at \u2014 and frightened ?\" \" Really, sir \u2014 really, Mr. Souchong \u2014 if you think you are doing the facetious with me \u2014 if you are making a jest of an unhappy state of things \u2014 a most happy circumstance in all other respects ; upon my word, sir, I don't under stand you !\" stammered poor Ringold, who was aware that Elizabeth Marrynett was firmly de termined, if the occasion should arise, to dismiss her unwelcome suitor, and who knew not what might have been discovered besides, if the catastrophe had occurred, although the lovers had not yet agreed to push their audacity so far as to a full revelation of the state of their affections, to all whom it might concern. \" How should you ?\" said Tobias, with a faint flash of suspicion visiting his own per-"], [33, "25 CUPID AND CUPIDITY. ceptive faculties. \" I have not yet explained my meaning quite clearly. All I want you to do is to get the housekeeper \u2014 your mother, of course \u2014 to tell Miss Marrynett that I love her a thousand times better for her father's injustice about his little boy ; that I am determined to marry her all the same if she had not a single shil- ling in the world ; and that, if she will meet me in the Turkish Kiosk in the grounds \u2014 close to the water, you know, where Mr. Marrynett some- times smokes his pipe \u2014 he still will stick to his pipe, which is anything but gentlemanly, and I have often offered him some of Tom's best cigars \u2014 I will unfold how I love her more to distraction than I can possibly say, or ever have said ; and how I have a plan to make both our fortunes, as man and wife, and take her for ever from her horrid stepmother's snubs and nasty cruelties, which you may depend now will go on growing worse and worse every day, till, perhaps, they don't stop much short of murder, in a genteel way. And I am going out to buy a brooch to put my hair in, for me to send at the same time, all on the sly, in tbe way women like. Don't you hear me ?\""], [34, "26 CUPID AND CUPIDITY. Here Ringold Segrave really and truly could not help bursting out into quite a peal of laughter, which astonished the clerks on the other side of the glass-door. The ideas of laughter and ledgers so seldom went together in those poor fellows' noddles ; at least, until the principals had vacated their listening-posts in the offices. \" I beg your pardon, Mr. Souchong,\" Rin gold exclaimed, checking his manifestation with some difficulty, \" I beg your pardon, but it is quite impossible. My mother knows her duty to her employer better than to enter into any clandestine correspondence between Mr. Marry nett's daughter and . But surely, sir,\" the conscience-stricken youth broke out, \" you don't need any passport to Miss Marrynett's hearing and presence ; and if your motives are really so disinterested, Mr. Marrynett can have nothing to say in the matter, whatever new notions he may have taken into his head against his daughter's rights to any fortune at his hands, for a long while to come.\" \" You do what I tell you, and your mother, too. You have nothing to do with my motives"], [35, "27 CUPID AND CUPIDITY. and intentions \u2014 or Mr. Marrynett's either,\" said Tobias, angrily. \" What do you mean, sir, by seeming to make a joke of me, when I request you to do me a little service of the kind ?\" \" You must excuse me, sir, I really cannot. I cannot recommend my mother to do anything that I even imagine may be displeasing to her employer, as regards anybody, unless I were prepared to take her upon my own charge for a decent maintenance.

I owe you no thanks, nor your mother either, I fancy, for your present share in my difficulties. You can take your ledger, sir, and go; but it will not be difficult, I flatter myself, to find another clerk in Liverpool, of equal competence, at a less salary.\" Ringold took up his ponderous tome, bowed"], [36, "28 CUPID AND CUPIDITY. with respectful disdain, and left Mr. Souchong's private sitting-room with a conviction that a tide was setting in that would either float him out into a fair and open sea, or drift him high and dry on some shelving bank of obstruction and harm."], [37, "CHAPTER II. THE UNWELCOME VISITOR. How long the time appeared to Ringold Se grave that day until the hour of release sounded in the Marrynett and Souchong counting-house, and he found himself at liberty to take some ac tion in the grand business of his own life ! He thought it most advisable, in the first instance, to put Elizabeth on her guard as to what was to be expected on the part of Mr. Tobias Souchong. Truth to say, he was him self rather puzzled by such an exhibition of disinterested attachment, as it had been pro posed he should make himself a medium to bring to the young lady's convictions. Puz zled, and possibly rather alarmed at the notion that Mr. Souchong might at last have really"], [38, "30 THE UNWELCOME VISITOR. found out the value of that pure and tender heart, and had fallen upon a very judicious means in consequence to move it in his favour. Luckily, Ringold had not been much of a visitor lately at Liverpool Palace, during the bustle of the christening preparations. He felt himself the more at liberty, now the main festivities were over, to make a call on his mother. The partners had left early to go on 'Change respecting their two newly-arrived cargoes from the east and west. Mr. Tobias remained shut up in his own room, inditing the most irresisti ble epistle he could imagine, conveying the sen timents and assurances he had wished Ringold to forward through his mother. It is not un likely, with an expectation that the manly natured and generous youth would improve any form of expression he could himself have hit upon. Unless the truth of the whole matter was that Mr. Tobias Souchong had taken sus picions, which he hoped to clear up by watching the effects produced. He had so great a conceit of his own talents of rhetoric that the"], [39, "31 THE UNWELCOME VISITOR. latter explanation seems the most probable. This letter he proposed to forward by hand, and to follow up the blow by appearing in person to confirm all that it should so eloquently affirm. And he had determined now that his mother, Lady Souchong, should be the bearer, although he knew well that she had announced herself at breakfast so offended by Mrs. Marrynett's be haviour at the christening party, that she was quite resolved not to pay her the attention of a call that day to ascertain the state of her health after her severe nervous crisis. It so happened also that Ringold was the last confidential clerk left on the premises, and it was in consequence his duty to lock up everything safe. He was engaged in this office with the last door of three outer clerks' rooms, meditating on very different matters, when he was rather surprised at hearing a weak, tremulous voice from the gloom, caused by the closed shutters of the counting house, inquiring, \"Please, sir, is this Mr. Marrynett's, the merchant's ?\" Ringold looked round ; and, as well as he could see for the darkness, espied a withered looking old man, in a tatterdemalion, whitey-"], [40, "32 THE UNWELCOME VISITOR. brown greatcoat, descending almost to his heels, very bad boots, and a strange, crazy setting palmetto hat, under whose shadow appeared a mean-featured, puckered visage, a pair of blood shot eyes, and a long bare scraggy neck, very partially covered by a wonderfully dirty flannel shirt, and a ragged bandanna handkerchief for a necktie. All this did not make up a very charming portrait, and the ill effect was heightened by a beggarly bundle, and a notched hedgeside crab-stick in a pair of hands seamy all over with age and hard work, but grasped with the tenacity of one who knows he has all his property for defence in the combination. \"What can this be?\" thought Ringold. \" Some Irish emigrant come a-begging ? Too old, surely, for that ; unless a famine has rooted him out, and there don't happen to be one this year in Ireland. Can it be an American tramp, picked up for a ' salt' at some place where there was nothing else to be got anything like a sea man? From Australia, perhaps, where these new gold discoveries are attracting all the bone and sinew of the land? And I wish I was there, too !\""], [41, "THE UNWELCOME VISITOR. 33 The more he looked and considered, however, the more he grew to believe the man must be a beggar. The eager, yearning expression in his glassy eyes, as he made so commonplace an inquiry, convinced Ringold he was not mistaken in the conjecture. Moved, then, by a degree of compassion for so old and weatherbeaten a son of misfortune, he replied very kindly, \" Yes, this is Mr. Marrynett's, my good man; but he is gone for the day. Still, if a shilling will be of any service to you from a man who is not much richer possibly than yourself, but has not the liberty of looking as poor, here's one at your service !\" \" A shilling ! Yes, yes ; thankee, young gentleman, thankee very kindly,\" the supposed beggar replied, extending his grimy paw with quivering eagerness. \" Much obliged to you, too ; but I wanted to see Mr. Marrynett, if \u2014 if \u2014 if he's the Marrynett whose chris'en name was Musberoom, and who married the daughter of the marine-store dealer in Goree Alley !\" \" That's our senior partner, sir ; but we don't talk much of the marine-store dealer in the establishment of latter times.

But it scarcely seemed to please the inquirer, whose countenance twitched up with a curious spasm as he responded : \" He were \u2014 he were, sir ! but he didn't do no harm to Mr. Marry nett. Contrary-like, he made over to him all he possessed in the world before the trial came on, that the Crown mightn't have the advantage of the goods and chattels in case it won the day. That was Mr. Marrynett's own expression, sir ; and he was five thousand pounds the better man for it when Jimmy Reade was cast for felony. And I am happy to hear on all sides, sir, there's been a blessing upon it in his hands, and that he's worth a plum or more any day he likes to count his till,\" this peculiar mendicant replied. \" Perhaps, if you doubled the figure you would be near the correct one, my good friend,\" said Ringold, surprised, but rather amused, at the old man's deliberate tone of estimate. \" Still, I don't know that you or I have much to do with that branch of the affair, as I sup-"], [43, "THE UNWELCOME VISITOR. 35 pose the most precise knowledge in the world will not put a guinea into either of our pockets.

Nevertheless, it occurred to the young man, as a portion of these reflections, that if the ad vantages of an alliance with his beloved Eliza beth were diminished, even in his eyes, by the apparition before him, the same effect would be produced in a much stronger degree in another quarter where it was desirable enough. He was, besides, very much puzzled by the nature of the queries addressed to him, and felt all the pain and difficulty of explaining the true position of affairs at Liverpool Palace, to the un fortunate old revenant. Moreover, he was un willing to let his own ideas on the subject tran spire, or to dissemble them so as to produce any false impression. On the whole, therefore, he thought it best to say \u2014 while expressing a very sincere degree of astonishment that he should"], [46, "38 THE UNWELCOME VISITOR. be speaking for the first time to Mr. James Reade, his employer's late father-in-law, after so long an absence \u2014 that, perhaps, he had better see Mr. Marrynett's partner's son, who was staying over office hours, and could give him every information. The old man replied, mutteringly \u2014 \" Yes, but I ain't dead. Why do you say late father in-law ? If I have been dead in law, I'm alive in myself, and have done many a hearty day's work since the judge told me I was to consider myself a banished bondsman \u2014 them were his very words \u2014 for one-and-twenty years, because I ought to have shown a better example to others, being so well off in the money way myself.

I paid him off in full since, when we met at the diggings, and he was dying for want of a meal's victuals over bags on bags of gold ! I wrung the villian's heart nigh out of his bosom, there and then, in return for what he'd done to me \u2014 as I'd do to every living soul alive yet that served me base as that rascal did, though I'm so much older a cripple now, and fit for little else than to be shovelled into my grave ! \""], [47, "39 THE UNWELCOME VISITOR. \" I'll call Mr. Souchong !\" said Ringold, by no means pleased with the maniacal kind of violence, the fury of speech, to which the old convict now gave way ; while his shrivelled, sunken eyes sparkled up with a fire that attested the still fierce flame of passion burning in his apparently exhausted frame. \" I'm here ! What the devil old beggar's this ?\" exclaimed Mr. Tobias Souchong, stepping haughtily out of his private cabinet, with a sealed letter in his hand. \" Who are you, sir, that tek upon ye's to call me an ' old beggar,' and in this house, too, which, if the stories I hear are true, owes to me and mine the beginnings of all its wealth ?\"\u25a0 returned the testy old stranger, starting up from a seat he was shuffling himself, uneasily and rheumatically down upon, in acceptance of the accommodation offered him by Ringold while he went to sum mon Mr. Souchong to make a third in the party. \" Is it a madman of your particular ac quaintance, Mr. Segrave, or some thief you have let into the premises?\" said Tobias, with the most exasperating insolence ; to which Ringold"], [48, "40 THE UNWELCOME VISITOR. was about to make some sufficiently expressive reply, when the stranger took up the cudgels with vehemence on his own part. \" Me a thief, sir ? How dare you say so now when I've a certificate of good character and peaceful behaviour for the twelve years I've been a freedman at Sydney and Geelong ? And, let me tell you, sir, there are far worse thieves that have never been tried and found guilty by judge and jury, all over the world, than them as have! And I shouldn't wonder that you're one of the number yourself ! I wouldn't leave you with an open sack of nuggets, I can tell you, on the honesty of your looks \u2014 and it's been done to me many and many a time.\" \" Please to kick this old rascal out if he's your friend, Mr. Segrave ; or go for a policeman for me if he's not ! \" said Tobias, savagely. \" It is Mr. Reade \u2014 Miss Elizabeth Marrynett's grandfather \u2014 who went out to Australia twenty years ago and more, he says !\" replied Ringold, watching the effect of his intimation. \" Yes, it is Muster Reade \u2014 Jimmy Reade, the marine-store dealer, in Goree Alley, that was !

Betsy's heart was always in the right place!\" exclaimed the old man, with an audible quiver of emotion in his latter tones. But Mr. Tobias Souchong's demeanour on this day was destined to continue difficult to be understood. Instead of looking disconcerted or amazed, he suddenly brightened up quite visibly. \" You're the old convict boy, are you?\" he said, eagerly. \" Well ! I can't say I think you're doing much the handsome by your grand daughter in coming back to disgrace her before people ; and her father won't make you so over and above welcome, as you seem to think !

For a moment it seemed as if he was about to swoon away. \" Dead, dead, dead ! \u2014 my daughter dead ! For whose sake alone \u2014 my poor Betsy dead, whom I saw last in a jail, weeping in my arms ! Dead ! \u2014 why should she be dead ? She would not be old now even \u2014 not very old ! I am her father, and I am not so very old ! \" An hysterical emotion followed on the words, which seemed almost to choke the unfortunate old fellow's breathing, and he sobbed and gasped for air for some moments, while Ringold proffered him what little aid was in his power, with silent sympathy ; and even Mr. Souchong respected for a brief interval the powerful workings of humanity in that aged breast. But the disgust which, as a true Mammonite, he entertained of poverty in all its forms, speedily suppressed this trifling weakness towards so repulsive, and likely to prove embarrassing, a case in point. \" Really, my good sir,\" he said to the old man,"], [51, "43 THE UNWELCOME VISITOR. \" a counting-house is not a proper place for a scene like this. But if you really are what you re present yourself to be, and want to know all the particulars from the fountain-head,\" he added, with calculating malice, \" I should recommend you to go to Mr. Marrynett's private residence, and enter into explanations with him.

Everybody knows Miss Marrynett has a grand father, and that's what keeps ber nose as near the water's edge as a turn-up one can be !\" replied Tobias Souchong, with a sneer. \" But it will be just as well, perhaps, if the fact is brought a little closer to her understanding ; and so I recommend you to go and make the acquaintance of the young lady, and Mr. Mar rynett's new family, without much further delay.

Mr. Marrynett had, meanwhile, been on 'Change, and thence returned home to dinner, considerably out of temper, but quite uncon scious of this new misfortune hanging over him. He felt himself beaten at his own weapons by Tobias Souchong, and knew not well how to present himself before his wife with his news. It is true he persuaded himself that he was a man of such immensely independent judgment and resolution, that he did not care what any foolish woman \u2014 and he thoroughly included his wife under that general designation \u2014 might think about what he chose to do.

It was this that had in a great degree at the same time alienated Mr. Marrynett from the empire of his wife, and prepared him so com pletely to set up one of his own, as he had in the resolution to sacrifice the prospects of his daughters to the grand establishment of his son and heir.

Mr. Marrynett's influence and example had most successfully launched the Pendragon mining shares on the market. He took a very considerable number himself, and other people, who confided in his judgment, and did not understand how, in this instance, it was warped, did the like. Indeed, he felt so encouraged in"], [57, "A MAN\u0152UVRING FATHER. 49 the move, that he had determined to offer Mr. Pendragon a largely increased advance on his landed property, on condition that he laid out the money to purchase shares in his own mines; and nobody could possibly be more willing to do that than Mr. Pendragon, who had the first and greatest condition of a success \u2022 ful theorist in perfection \u2014 unbounded self-re liance and belief.

But we must not rush upon destruction with our eyes open, like stupid moths. And I can't help thinking that Miss Elizabeth suspects something. She remarked only yesterday \u2014 that even the one of the young ladies that has very light hair, like baby's, isn't the least like the darling little creature in other respects.\" Mr. Marrynett meanwhile proceeded with ex traordinary impetuosity, muttering to himself all manner of violent counsels and resolutions, to the forbidden apartment, where he expected to find his eldest daughter, by the report of her enemies. Elizabeth, however, was not so much to blame as her parent so rapidly concluded for her disobedience. Unhappy as she felt under the conviction that her friends would not be able to understand why she had so suddenly and completely altered her habits of intimacy and communion with them, she would doubtless have waited for some opportunity to explain matters that would not seem to fly too directly in the teeth of her father's orders. Moreover,"], [66, "58 A MAN\u0152UVRING FATHER. she was not unaware that most of her doings were under espionage and surveillance. Two words, very French, but not unknown as English facts. She had just succeeded for the first time, after hours of anxious and almost, one might say, motherly soothing and endearments, in quieting little Brenda off into a flushed and fevered sleep, when Mrs. Segrave stole up to the nursery with a jug of iced lemonade, as a pretext for the visit to the little sufferer. And having ascertained that the child was asleep, and that only harm less little Eugenie was present nursing her doll, the housekeeper ventured to say what a time it was since she had \" seen to speak\" with her dear Miss Elizabeth, and how there was another person still wretcheder about it down in the little old parlour looking on the mulberry clump. And, besides, Ringold had some piece of news to tell, which he declared he only could and would to her dear young lady, if she would just step down to the said housekeeper's room look ing out on the mulberry clump. In a whisper Elizabeth explained why it was she had not yet renewed the dear old pleasant meet ings and chit-chat of the times before she went"], [67, "59 A MAN\u0152UVRING FATHER. to the Finishing Academy, and timidly asked her friend, whether it would not be best to wait a few days, till her father forgot about his prohibi- tion, before she and Ringold met again ? At the same time the poor girl's colour rose, and her eyes quite shone up over her face, as if with the light behind a transparency, revealing all its ordinarily unseen beauty of love and truth in the visible workings of the fine spirit within. But Mrs. Segrave assured her it was not merely to say to her face what he was always telling her, she knew, in his letters, how fondly and truly he was hers, but Ringold had some very important intelligence to communicate. And not only about Mr. Souchong and his \" non- sense pretensions,\" the old lady gravely added, but there was something else very queer in the case, though her own son would not tell her what. But he had brought some wretched old kind of beggarman with him, who was sitting down in the servants' hall, and whom he said he wanted Miss Elizabeth to see and speak with. What or why for, she could not imagine, as Ringold himself knew Miss Elizabeth had hardly any money allowed her at all for her pocket,"], [68, "60 A MAN\u0152UVRING FATHER. and therefore had hardly anything to give away in charity. Elizabeth, however, naturally enough seized at the pretence. \" Papa only told me 1 was not to go sitting and working and talking with the housekeeper, dear Mamma Segrave ; he wants me to be a fine lady now. But he said nothing against my being charitable and assisting any poor person I could, and perhaps this is one that wants to get into some of the hospitals papa subscribes to, and that is why Ringold has brought him. I may go and see the poor man in the mulberry parlour, you know, especially if you can remain here with little Brenda a few minutes, and let her have your finger instead of mine to keep in her dear little clasp.\" \" I am afraid mine is not so soft and kind, Miss Elizabeth, but I'll try.\" And so the bargain was made, and Elizabeth, with a heart beating wildly with love and hope and pleasure at the thought of beholding her lover in freedom again, stole down stairs to the mulberry parlour \u2014 followed at no great interval by Miss Eugenie, who, under the instructions"], [69, "61 A MAN\u0152UVRING FATHER. and orders of Mrs. Primmer, promised to be come in the course of time as artful, tricky, and insidious, as that worthy dame herself. We need not describe the meeting between the lovers : the tenderly bashful embrace ; the modest warmth of their kindly kiss of re-union. There was no need of words, when eyes beamed so eloquently with love and joy, to declare the happiness in the two fond hearts permitted to beat against each other for a few instants of ecstatic feeling thus. But Ringold was aware he had no time to lose in declaring what might be considered the business part of his object in seeking the interview. He told Elizabeth, therefore, his reasons for believing the decisive hour of their destiny was fast approaching, in consequence of Mr. Tobias Souchong's avowed intention of making her a formal tender of his hand. And he stated what had passed be tween them pretty exactly, though perhaps he did not dwell superfluously on his rival's parade of disinterested and personal attachment towards their common object. Elizabeth was much annoyed, and possibly a little frightened, by the intimation, though she"], [70, "62 A MAN\u0152UVRING FATHER. had had so long: notice of the likelihood of what it seemed was now to happen. She was surprised, too. \" I thought what my father said about giving us no money till he died \u2014 putting all his money in land for the little boy \u2014 would have turned Mr. Souchong altogether from any thoughts of me. I can't make it out. I am sure he cares nothing about me in reality. But it will all come to the same thing. I shall tell him plainly I do not like him for a husband, and never can, nor will. And if he asks me why, I will tell him that, too ! My father will not concern himself now whether I have Mr. Souchong or not. Mrs. Primmer told me this very morning she was pretty well sure of that, from what her mistress has told her. The only thing is, Ringold dear, should we ever dare to ask papa's leave for you and me to marry or not ? That is what frightens me the most !\" \" I scarcely know, dearest !

Ringold then related the circumstances of old Reade's apparition a short time previously at the Marrynett counting-house, gradually leading on the topic to a no less startling announcement, that this old man had insisted on being guided to Mr. Marrynett's residence, and seeing his daughter's child and himself at once, regardless of the facts of his own tattered and demolished appearance in all that regarded the outer man. To say the whole truth, he was already in the house, and finding that Mr. Marrynett was ex pected home shortly, but had not arrived, had scarcely allowed him the opportunity to break the arrival to his granddaughter in his feverish anxiety and resolution to see her without delay. It seemed, indeed, as if the poor old man cal culated with certainty on the best imaginable reception in that house, and seemed entirely oblivious of the fact that he looked a good deal more like a scarecrow than anything else in his habiliments, and of the changes the twenty years of his absence had produced. In vain, Ringold declared, he had explained to him on the way, as clearly as he could with forbearance towards his excited feelings, the"], [73, "65 A MAN\u0152UVRING FATHER. circumstances of Mr. Marrynett's second mar riage to a lady of birth and high connexions, and great pride of position, and of the numerous second family that now flourished around her, under Mr. Marrynett's roof-tree.

He had expressed himself very much to that effect. \" He was always a greedy, grasping fellow ; but let him be grown as tall a cock as ever flapped its wings on a dunghill of his own, neither he, nor his proud lady 'ither, can deny he owes the beginnings of all he is, or all he can have made her, to me and my poor daughter!\" the old man had vehemently exclaimed. \" Mar-"], [75, "67 A MAN\u0152UVRING FATHER. rynett were nothing but a stout-built, artful dodger of a young fellow before the mast, where you don't expect so much to find that sort, when my daughter took a fancy to him, and would never let me rest until she got my leave to marry him, and a small setting-up in life, that started them fair. I did not know till after wards he was so well aware of my savings being so good, until he came to see me in the prison, and argufied me over that the only way to save it from Gover'ment's clutches was to make it over to him, every stiver and stick, which I did.

She pointed out the capabilities of the place to Mrs. Marrynett, in this respect, the first day of her arrival, when she heard of the heavy affair that was getting up for the christening. There was just the very lawn for a fete champetre in the midst of the pleasure grounds behind the house. There certainly was one as smooth and glossy as a velvet carpet, the product of years of scything vol. ii. 6"], [90, "82 THE THf. DANSANT. and rolling. She declared the expense would be nothing ; for what was the cost of tea and coffee, and a little fruit and cakes? Then Madame witnessed that what she proposed, however strange in Liverpool, was quite the style in Paris; at least, at Fontainebleau and Com piegne, into whose imperial intimacies and un bendings Madame de la Mazurka gave it plainly to be understood she had often been a researched and distinguished guest. In fact, simple amusements and pleasures had become quite the style, she said, in Paris. Quite the reigning taste \u2014 as the plainest diet and drinks are sometimes taken to, certainly, by satiated voluptuaries, for a brief interval of nursing and recovery. Among these \" simple amusements,\" Madame reckoned dancing, conversation, and \" intelligent and inconsequential coquetry.\" Not, of course, such a truly British dead-set as that surprising Rosanna was making at \" poor old Pendragon !\" And, perhaps, a little piquet or whist for the elders at the side tables. The effect intended to be produced being, to speak truth, almost that of a popular diversion in the open grounds of a"], [91, "THE TH\u00a3 DANSANT. 83 m> public garden \u2014 say, \" for what one knows,\" the Mabille.

They needed, without doubt, some consolation to their \" wounded vanity !\" So, perhaps, did Madame the Countess's, though she never alluded to it in the course of the entire exposition. Neglecting to pay any homage to that was one of the causes why Mr. Pendragon had suddenly become \" poor old Pendragon !\" He was too much absorbed in his own range of ideas to take any notice of a personage who never entered into them in any interesting con nexion, and he had no notion whatever of play ing the dangler of Parisian society to the cajo leries of a passee coquette, whose pretensions his own high-class experiences satisfied him were altogether unfounded, or derived from a court and society which his aristocratic instincts re- 6\u20142"], [92, "84 THE THE DANSANT. pudiated as upstart and sordid, in almost equal degrees.

In reality, Rosanna Clanbrassey recommended herself by being almost the reverse in every thing of her frivolous, ignorant, hard-souled, berouged, but still handsome and pretentious sister. Her mind was highly cultivated and deeply reflective. Almost broodingly so.

Tears had actually streamed from her eyes on the occasion when"], [93, "THE THE DANSANT. 85 Mr. Pendragon had given way to the warmth of his own feelings, and expressed himself with a degree of poetical eloquence and elevation, on a sufficiently common-place subject otherwise. This was pleasing. The interest Miss Clan brassey took in what interested the owner of Pendragon Mohr was still more so ; and she made no demands of an irksome nature upon his attention and notice in any personal way. Altogether, Mr. Pendragon liked her, and showed that he did so by keeping almost exclu sively to her company, whenever Mr. Marrynett was not at hand to join in endless discussions on the most interesting subject of all. On this very occasion, when Mr. Pendragon had special business with Mr. Marrynett and his lawyer \u2014 finding he had some time probably to wait, he strolled out on the lawn, and made up at once to Rosanna.

And, to be sure, Mr. Pendragon said nothing at all to support the fluttering inference in Miss Clanbrassey's cogitations ; and, perhaps, the more general surmises of the lookers-on. They certainly seemed engaged for a long time in very special and apart conversation, straying to a distance from the principal groups assembled. So special and apart that Mrs. Bagnigge Wells, the great London Contractor's lady (no one ever said in what, but bones and dust were the foundations of that personage's arrogance and scorn of all mankind besides not equally rich), who was down in Liverpool on a visit to some relations, made the sneering remark : \" Come, there's a case of the old, old tale in perfection !\" to the Countess de la Mazurka, who she did not know to be Rosanna's sister, and highly reverenced as a \" countess,\" no matter of where or what. But Madame de la Mazurka was above all such old-fashioned notions as taking part with kinsfolk, and clannishness of every kind, unless that which is founded in a community of in terests.

There was, indeed, rather an extensive gather ing of the Marrynett circle on the occasion, to make up to outsiders for the necessarily limited invitations to the christening. But curiously enough, Mrs. Marrynett herself, though well inclined to any opportunity of display, grum bled at the notion that this assemblage should still be on the boy's account. \" What's the use making such a terrible parade about it ?\" she said, quite angrily, when Mrs. Primmer suggested thatsomething should be added on the announcement of the The Dansant, to show that Mrs. Marrynett desired to thank her numerous friends, on the occasion, for their kind inquiries on the recent happy event. \" You think of nothing else but that tedious baby, Primmer ; and, I daresay, it will all end in dis appointment !

And although her mistress even, at last, in a somewhat similar tone, declared the Tea was given on her daugh ters' account, and that she would not have the baby brought out at all, Mrs. Primmer secretly dressed it up in its finest long-clothes and laces,"], [98, "90 THE THE DANSANT. and watched from the nursery window for Mr. Marrynett's appearance in the fete, to take it down to him, whether her lady liked it or not ! In fact, there never was a completer exhibi tion of the vanity of human wishes than in this case. After all she had wished and prayed and done to obtain this great blessing of male progeny, no sooner was the object attained, than Mrs. Mar rynett seemed to be made unhappy by her very success. The triumphant mother of the heir of the Marrynetts appeared in truth to take quite a morbid dislike to the poor infant, from the very moment when it had been proclaimed so to the fullest extent. Her hatred of the Souchongs, which now took so rabidly excited a form, was possibly roused into such activity by consciousness that their sneers and calculations in their own inte rests had driven her, in conjunction with her own vanity, thirst for power, and intolerance of opposition, even on nature's own part \u2014 acted upon by artful and villanous suggestion \u2014 into the mortifying and inextricable position in which she found herself."], [99, "THE TH\u00a3 DANSANT. 91 Until the unlucky hour, when, under the in fluence of the species of madness which pos sessed her always ill-balanced mind, she had so fatally committed herself, I do not know that Mrs. Marrynett's maternal affection had ever been of an absorbing and dominant cha racter. She had always, it is true, been a lavishly indulgent mamma, in everything that reflected back a share of lustre on herself. No expense of dress, for example, or of outward embellishment of any kind, had ever been spared with her eldest daughter, the Beauty. Mrs. Marrynett was delighted with the admiration her loveliness excited, as long as people made it a point of adding, \"And isn't she like her beautiful mamma ?\" But now of late, when admiration began to be more exclusively directed to the younger charms, the vain and exacting mother had begun to look upon her Beauty daughter something in the light of a rival ; and in transferring her so easily and hastily to the charge of a woman like her sister, the Countess de la Mazurka, for the distant and dangerous marriage-mart of London, she showed"], [100, "92 THE Th\u00a3 DANSANT. incontestably how little the real interests of her child were of consequence to her. With her other children it was much the same, though in different forms of display. Mrs. Marrynett encouraged the petulant bril liancy of her daughter Charlotte's exhibitions, her habits of indiscriminate coquetry and attrac tion, because they amused her, careless of the possible ill results on her future career, and the misery she was capable of diffusing among others. Aleck's dashing, headlong spirit was only snubbed when it presented inconveniences to her mamma, or her mamma's furniture, in the noise and riot of her proceedings. No efforts were made to distinguish for training and cultivation the germs of really fine feeling and generous humanity that occasionally shot wild from that full-sapped stock. Geraldine's Lydia Languish airs excited her mother's alternate ridicule and encouragement, as a taking variety ; and Eugenie's unusual capabilities, amounting in some things to genius, were scarcely appre ciated, excepting in her industry and extraordi nary tact as a little detective and spy.

But now that so powerful a reaction of re morse, and dread of infinitely greater disgrace than her own and her husband's mania prompted her to escape, at so heavy a price, had fairly set in, Mrs. Marrynett really felt as if the maternal instinct was for the first time awakened in her heart. And this passion of fondness for her disinherited daughters was destined to prove the most powerful agent of retribution in her hard ened nature. So true it is that our faults pre pare their own punishment. However, on this occasion, whether she was comforted by the skilful suggestion on the part of her medical attendants, of the possibility of little Clanbrassey clearing himself off the scene \u2014 or from some sudden fluctuation in her semi- Hibernian composition \u2014 Mrs. Marrynett was in better spirits on this day of the Th6 Dansant, than she had shown herself for some time. The visitors, who arrived either by the front entrance, or an avenue from a road on the back of the grounds, found their hostess seated in full glory, like some empress receiving her guests, under a"], [102, "THE THE DANSANT. 94 a Turkish tent, or pavilion, as it was called. This consisted of a canopy, supported on gilded poles, of red and white canvas \u2014 the Marrynett ship colours \u2014 with a lofty spear-head in the centre \u2014 surmounted by a flag of the same. The sur rounding pleasaunce was of good extent, and beautifully laid out with flower-beds, little groves of trees and shrubs, fountains, statues, and all the regulation ornaments of a villa paradise. The trees were certainly rather undergrown, and did not much interrupt the view to the estuary of the Mersey, sailed over by its majestic swans of commerce. There was a band of music, chiefly of wind instruments, which filled the enclosures with their long blares of melody, and assured the guests they were coming upon something good. These guests themselves were all as fine as wealth could furnish materials ; and, in some instances, almost limited to the female portion, however, as elegantly got up as the most exact adherence to Parisian decrees could secure. It was a very gay scene \u2014 plenty of carriages and plenty of dust. \" Carriage-people,\" in fact, were nearly the only people thought worthy of"], [103, "THE THE DANSANT. 95 an invitation to Liverpool Palace. The elite of the commercial aristocracy were there.

A The Dansant was speedily discovered to be dancing, accompanied by the refreshment of tea and coffee, and the et ceteras which Madame the Countess had previously declared. And Madame the Countess laboured very hard to give a light and pleasing movement to the whole affair. But it might not be. The British density was not to be overcome. People did not understand a dance in one's ordinary clothes, in the open air, on the green sward. They admitted in general that whatever Madame the Countess did must"], [104, "96 THE THE DANSANT. be right \u2014 for was she not a Countess, and from Paris ? But still the thing would not go : the company speedily began to split themselves into little, discontented knots, and to form cabals and talk against each other and their hosts in scat tered corners of the grounds. Thus, when Sir John and Lady Souchong arrived, whom Mrs. Marrynett did not much expect, or at all desire, though they had been duly honoured with cards, they found Mrs. Marrynett almost alone in her fairy bower, looking very much surprised and annoyed at what was happening. The Countess was mean while indefatigably but vainly distributing herself over the landscape \u2014 endeavouring to form a junction of the company on some specific plan of amusement. The girls were willing enough to dance, but the young men were shy and sulky, and professed their inability to understand the sort of thing at all. Sir John, as usual the pink of courtly man ners and complaisance, had brought Mrs. Mar rynett a nosegay of flowers almost as big as himself, which she received with the gracious observation that she was quite sick of that sort"], [105, "THE THE DANSANT. 97 of thing. Philippina would insist on putting them in her bedroom even, where they made her so faint she could hardly breathe ! Lady Souchong looked as cross and offended as her hostess, and had only come in obedience to the orders of her eldest son, or perhaps a little in the amiable hope of witnessing something extraordinary and annoying to the Marrynetts in the affair of the returned convict. She in quired at once for Miss Marrynett, with the observation that she had a particular message from Mr. Tobias, who would shortly follow on. Tom Souchong arrived with his parents, and was already gloomily sauntering about the grounds, looking for his scornful lady-love, and making up his mind to know what her changed demeanour could possibly mean, if he perished in the attempt ! Mrs. Marrynett informed her ladyship, with a malicious smile, that Miss Marrynett was with her papa, in the housekeeper's room, she be lieved, settling some little difference on some point of conduct, in which the young lady did not please her papa.

Adolphus would show her the way, and she called to a fat page, who was going about in a distracted state with a large silver tray of coffee, which had been unanimously refused at the outset of his career by three captains of Mr. Marrynett's ships, who were wandering here and there in forlorn company, like fish out of water, and wondering what their owner meant by asking them to a festivity where there was no grog. Adolphus promptly let his tray fall, in the zeal of his obedience, and Lady Souchong left him to gather up the debris, and to find out the locality aimed at by her own instincts. She felt satisfied she could confide in them for that purpose. Mrs. Marrynett had the satisfaction to think it likely \" her ladyship\" (whom she disliked for being so as much as for anything else) would arrive in the height of a discussion which ought to satisfy her of the uselessness and impropriety of her son's continuing to fix his affections on Mr. Marrynett's eldest daughter's ten thousand"], [107, "THE TH__ DANSANT. 99 pounds. But, contrary to her expectations, the row was rather over, and a sort of peace patched up, on terms which we had better now declare. Observing the excellent effect produced by the assurance he had thundered to his daughter, that Ringold Segrave was only enamoured of the prospects of advancement an union with a Marrynett held out, Mr. Marrynett renewed the assault in that first sign of a breach the moment the unlucky lover-clerk had withdrawn, and could no longer offer his protest. He repeated the statement with the greatest earnestness and pas sion to a girl who had been brought up the very reverse of her Beauty sister, in a thorough belief and conviction that she was one of the plainest of mortal creatures. Her school experiences had confirmed the notion, and even her convict grandfather's loving recognition of her resem blance to her mother, and the proof he furnished of that mother's unloved and woful fate, brought the conviction upon her with more overwhelm ing vitality and force than ever. How this idea would work upon so sensitive and yet subdued a nature needs not be painted out.

With these reflections passing through her mind, a com promise of difficulties presented itself, which, in such severe and doubtful exigencies, is almost always the favourite refuge of human weakness and uncertainty. \" But what, then, can Mr. Souchong be after in his addresses to me, father,\" she mournfully inquired, \" if I am personally so incapable of inspiring attachment ? It is true, he is not him self handsome and noble-hearted like Ringold Segrave. But all my life nearly he has made no secret to me that he disliked me, and looked upon me as the butt of his spiteful ridicule. Though, to be sure, I do not understand why it is that he persists in his pursuit of me, in the face of your declaration that you will give none of your daughters fortunes \" \" Don't go off on that broomstick, Elizabeth.

I will promise, on my part, not to marry Ringold Segrave \u2014 never to marry him \u2014 without your permission.

And if he were rich, you say, he would not marry me.\" Mr. Marrynett was singularly tempted also by this form of compromise. As has been seen, he did not particularly desire the honour of becoming Tobias Souchong's father-in-law, on his own account. He looked upon him chiefly as a means to prevent the gross misal liance of his daughter with the housekeeper's son. To keep his money suited with his own favourite plans much better than parting with it. Perhaps he experienced some twinge of compassion and relenting towards his child. He certainly perceived very clearly that, ner vous and irresolute as she mostly was, she was formidably fixed in her notions on this subject."], [112, "104 THE THE DANSANT. But in his own heart, indeed, he had very little doubt that an union with such a selfish, snarling little cur as Tobias Souchong, must be unhappy for any woman. \" If you would give up Ringold Segrave alto gether,\" he said at last, hesitatingly ; \" and I must say it would be a great shame of you to fasten him down to an engagement with you that never can come to any result, for I shall never consent, that's certain.

Were you trying it on them both at once, then, as Mrs. Marry nett did on me and Edward Malton, as I was afterwards told?\" \" Let me but refuse this cowardly fibster, and do in everything else as you please, father,\" exclaimed Elizabeth, provoked to positive fury by this latter insinuation, so opposed to the integrity and sincerity of her feelings. \"And surely you need no other proof to convince you that Souchong has endeavoured to cheat you in this, which you say you never forgive.\" \" Well, you can do as you like \u2014 a wilful"], [114, "106 THE THE DANSANT woman must have her way ; but, remember, you're in for the life of an old maid ever after, and by your own fault alone ; for you know the penalties of taking the other impu dent sneak, and no one else is ever likely to try it on like either of these fellows.\" Almost precisely at the moment when Mr. Marrynett had signified this ungracious indul gence, Lady Souchong made her way into the housekeeper's room.

And no wonder, for it was hardly possible to feign not to perceive anything unusual in the scene she came upon, with Mr. Marrynett's excited visage glaring at her, and his daughter's tear bathed one turned instantly away. She explained, however, with her accustomed dulcet flow, how delighted she was to see her dear Miss Marrynett home from her studies so much improved \u2014 so much everything that could be desired.

Has he any documents \u2014 letters \u2014 or things of that sort to show ? Even then he'll sell them cheaply enough back, I dare say !\" Elizabeth listened to these sagacious observa tions with really fearfully distended eyes of wonder and indignation. \" You then think it impossible,\" she ex claimed, \" that any man could love me for my self alone ?\" 8\u20142"], [124, "116 THE THE DANSANT IS CONTINUED.

I haven't the least doubt now she all along pur posely winked at the goings on with Segrave ; and his artful old hag of a mother, of course, put the rogue up, from his infancy, to the trick of winning his master's daughter, to make his own fortune at her expense.\" \" It's false, sir ; and if you were a gentleman in mind or heart you would never dare to think so !\" Mrs. Segrave entered at this moment in her violated sanctum with these words on her"], [126, "118 THE THE DANSANT IS CONTINUED. lips, adding \u2014 \" La, Miss Elizabeth, whatever's happened, making you so pale ? You don't care what he says, I hope ?\" \" I'll tell you afterwards ; I must go and look after that poor old fellow now,\" said Elizabeth, quite dizzily, her last hold on hope and belief, as it were, shattered by this final worldly exposi tion of what to minds so mercenary and selfish as her father's and Tobias Souchong's seemed the realities of the case. And she tottered out of the apartment, leaving Mr. Souchong and Mrs. Segrave to a somewhat stormy interchange of mutual enlightenment on the subject of what had occurred to produce the present condition of affairs. Meanwhile the convict Belisarius had pro ceeded on what was no doubt the eccentrically revengeful impulse of an old man in the decay of his faculties, stung by what he deemed in gratitude and cruelty into the readiest means of retaliation. His sole thought of the moment was how to revenge himself on Mr. Marrynett \u2014 assail his pride in the tenderest point, with exposure. If he had reflected, he would have remembered that he was also doing incredible"], [127, "119 THE TH_5 DANSANT IS CONTINUED. \u2666 harm to the one object in the world that re mained to him to cherish. It was only in har mony with the habits of his whole life that the rash impulse took the peculiar form it did. The old man pocketed Lady Souchong's half-crown with a ravenous satisfaction, in addition to the opportunity it gave him of making his first proclamation. \" Blessings on your honour's ladyship.

Are there fire works?\" said Miss Matilda Potts, the eminent brewer's daughter, a young lady about the same age, and united by the tenderest young-lady friend ship with the third Miss Marrynett. In fact, Miss Potts was communicating at the moment to a sympathetic auditor her idea that she had fallen irrecoverably in love with the handsomest and cleverest young actor that ever was seen in the whole world, though his merits were not yet universally acknowledged, and Miss Potts had only seen him perform Laertes to some town star's Hamlet. \" But you never saw how ridiculous the stumpy little fellow looked beside him, that was Hamlet \u2014 nobody ever noticed him, I am sure, compared ; and he has got such a love of a name \u2014 guess what it is, Geraldine.

The sentimental young lady addressed this query with very great haughtiness to the hag gard old scarecrow, who had turned a little out of his way towards them. \" I'm a begging, miss \u2014 young ladies all !"], [131, "THE THE DANSANT IS CONTINUED. 123 I am Jimmy Reade, Mr. Marrynett's father-in law \u2014 a returned convict !

Alexandrina Marrynett and Tom Souchong were at the very height of a most interesting dialogue"], [132, "124 THE THl5 DANSANT IS CONTINUED. for them at the time, when their attention was also attracted in the direction indicated. Tom Souchong had been driven almost frantic by the treatment he experienced from his adored Beauty, when he had ascertained where she was in the grounds, and had made up to her, hoping for a renewal of old friend liness and familiarity of welcome. And yet the Beauty had, in fact, a great secret weakness for Tom, who was a similarly handsome creation, and, if not too largely endowed with the highest gifts of intellect, was a young fellow made up of hearty manliness and gallantry of demeanour, and as such was necessarily acceptable to the fair sex. And Tom had been devoting him self for two years and upwards, at every oppor tunity of Miss Adelaide's recesses from school, to prove how smittert he was with the charms the young creature undoubtedly possessed in a rare and constantly developing perfection. For her sake, and for her sake only, had Tom Souchong, after being plucked for all the sci entific branches of the military service, placed his name on the list of applications to His Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chief for a"], [133, "125 THE THE DANSANT IS CONTINUED. commission in a cavalry regiment. And of a surety Master Tom had made some hopeful progress in his sighing and suing, for it was a fact of which there could be no reasonable doubt that he was lawfully possessed of a cor rect photograph of the young beauty, and had a ring of her splendid black hair; both richly mounted and enclosed in a locket, which he al ways wore by a tiny gold chain over his heart. More by token that it was literally driven into Tom Souchong's broadly-developed chest as deep as itself on an occasion when he was thrown at a steeple-chase, the winner, over the last hurdle, and nearly paid for his victory with his life. But it must be admitted Tom had not yet ventured to make any open and formal declaration of his sentiments to so awful a con centration of female loveliness, on whose fiat hung the destiny of his life. Chiefly for the reason, indeed, that he was scarcely ever allowed a moment's private speech with his goddess, through the cares of Mrs. Primmer, or the in terruptions of the sisters. And if ever the fortunate rarity came to pass, poor Tom had hitherto found himself too restrained by this"], [134, "126 THE THE DANSANT IS CONTINUED. very anxiety to be effective in his manner of broaching the subject, and some vague con sciousness perhaps that he ought to have some thing to offer besides himself to a young lady of Miss Adelaide Marrynett's position and ex pectations. And now he had not even yet a profession in life assured him, and felt that he ought at least to be enabled to make an offer of his heart and hand and a younger brother's portion \u2014 in a showy uniform ! For my own part, were I historiographer of the Miss Marrynetts, I could not precisely undertake to say whether the beautiful Adelaide returned her adorer's idolatry in any adequate degree, or not. She had been pleased, no doubt, like any other beauty, with the first recognition of her right to dominion by her charms, in the dis plays of admiration and enthusiasm thus ex cited. She must have been a consenting party to the gift of the photograph, if we even take it that Tom obtained possession of the circle of gorgeous capillary ebony by some surreptitious artifice, or open violence, like my lord's in the \" Rape of the Lock.\" But Adelaide might merely be amusing herself, like other beauties,"], [135, "THE TUt DANSANT IS CONTINUED. 127 in sporting with the agonies of her admirers in their enthralment, which we are to presume yields them as much satisfaction and triumph as the angler derives from the glittering leaps and contortions of his trout and salmon in the basket, or leaving their native element on the line. Still 1 should say she had not formed any maturely considered decision in favour even of so handsome and jolly a young suitor, since she lent so attent an ear to her Parisian aunt's suggestions of the grand possibilities in the matrimonial line awaiting her in London, and acquiesced so complacently in her mamma's arrangements for her to offer her charms in the great mart for every species of merchandise, under the auspices of that intelligent and un scrupulous matchmaker. Perhaps, after all, the Beauty's chief meaning in assenting to the plans formed for her ad vantage was simply to secure new and purpler clouds of incense to her vanity, and enjoy for a season the triumphs and glorification due to charms so exalted as those her mother's folly and her whole course of training assured her she was endowed withal."], [136, "128 THE THE DANSANT IS CONTINUED. In the presence and under the counsels of her worldly aunt, whom she looked up to with great reverence, as the possessor of innumerable valuable secrets of the toilette, and of the whole art of getting on by marriage, the Beauty, how ever, was beginning to grow ashamed of the \" nonsensical flirtation \" she might have hither to indulged in with Tom Souchong.

But the idea of the younger son of a provincial trader ! A creature who has not even taken a footing in any profession, and who has no money worth speaking of!

You"], [137, "129 THE TH__ DANSANT IS CONTINUED. must never give Mr. Thomas Souchong another thought, dear, unless you mean to throw away all the advantages nature has conferred upon you to succeed in attaining social position, and take up in a long engagement with a cornet of cavalry ! Long engagements almost always end badly. The man is free enough and enjoys his liberty till he no longer cares to part with it, or, what still oftener happens, parts with it to another on considerations which did not affect his first selfish selection. The woman goes on pining and set apart, neither married nor single, deprived of all the advantages of either condition, and is in the end most likely cut by the creature for whom she has sacrificed her existence, or compels him to make to her what she herself learns to appreciate is a sacrifice on his part, and has but too much cause to recognise for such, every remaining hour of her life !\" On these and such-like considerations Adelaide engaged herself, though, perhaps, with some little reluctance, to keep thenceforth as clear as she could of further compromising with Mr. Tom Souchong \u2014 at least not until she had tried how VOL.

As farther security, she arranged to keep herself well under the wing of Madame the Countess whenever there should be any danger of renewed relations with Mr. Tom Souchong of too intimate and bring-to-book a character. And, besides, on the occasion of the The Dansant it was quite right that the eldest young lady of the family \u2014 that was recognised as such \u2014 should assist in the reception and entertainment of the guests, under Madame's experienced tu telage. And poor Tom had found it quite impossible to break through the distance and reserve thus imposed upon him. Whenever he spoke to the niece, the aunt answered him ; when he offered his arm to her, the aunt took it, or playfully or dered him off to assist in the great business of the entertainment. \" So many young ladies, and hardly any one to dance them ! No, I'll have no danglers about me, when cavaliers are wanted so terribly ! It would be a shameful monopoly of which I am, both my niece and myself, incapable.

Nor did he find it possible to engage her at tention for a single moment afterwards, even when he requested it so pointedly as at last to exclaim aloud in his agony, regardless of the countess's supercilious surprise \u2014 \" Oh do, Adelaide ! Do let me speak to you only for half a dozen minutes ! I have some thing to say !\" \" Certainly not, Mr. Souchong, while Miss Marrynett is under my charge !

I've often told you not to bother me about her wonderful charms, if she is such a loveliness !

So the manly young lady thoroughly considered them. \" Oh, but she is treating me so shamefully, Aleck; regularly cutting me. I don't know what to do to get her to speak to me.\" \" I wouldn't try anything, if I were you ; I'd"], [143, "A PROPOSAL ON THE LADY'S SIDE. 135 cut her in turn.

The species of delirium which had urged her on and supported her thus far in her extraordinary outburst, seemed suddenly to break and vanish away around her mind, and let in a rude daylight of reality and established opinion to her own perception, on what she had done. A deadly sense of shame and disgrace sunk like some powerful, sickening poison on her heart ; and, infinitely to Tom Souchong's increase of consternation, she tottered down to the ground. She did not, however, go fairly off. Her frame was too strong and young for that. \" Leave me, Tom !\" she exclaimed, bursting into a passion of tears. \"I have been talking dreadful nonsense ; but you go and join the rest.

The Jimmy Reade catastrophe was only as yet in what might be styled the earlier stage of development, inasmuch as the returned convict was just at that moment emerging on the scene of his eccentric run-a-muck as a beggar.

For diversion, it could certainly not be called, having in view the anxiously strained countenances of the company, and the great terror they all of them clearly stood in of one another, awaiting the moment of federal execution ! The Beauty herself was, however, seated dis dainfully on the turf, having declined all the partners that offered themselves hitherto, on the plea, that mamma would not be pleased for her to dance while other young ladies, mamma's guests, had not \"people\" to dance with. She would stand up the next set, or the \" Lancers.\" She liked the \" Lancers,\" and many young ladies didn't care for them, because they were so difficult to remember; thus pacing a compliment to herself, to the universal attraction she was ex ercising, the powers of her intellect, and the politeness and forbearance she felt herself dis playing towards girls not so largely gifted in the means of fascination, besides keeping herself aloof and select, which the Countess assured"], [159, "A PROPOSAL ON THE LADY'S SIDE. 151 her were very eminent characteristics of the exclusive world to which she was shortly to be introduced. But the truth is the Beauty was in a fit of indignant sullens on the dog-in-the-manger principle. She had observed Tom Souchong's retirement and junction with Alexandrina, with anything but satisfaction, although the sole occasion of the defection herself, by her unkind and repelling demeanour. Adelaide was certainly not unaware of her sister's strongly pronounced liking for Tom. Aleck concealed very few of her ideas on any subject, and least of all her fondness and admi ration for her dashing young man playmate.

Accordingly, the well-meaning and repentant Aleck found her sister in no very propitious mood for the appeal she had so handsomely made up her mind to. All her lovely features were, on the contrary, instinct with scorn, and sense of insulted supre macy. Her fine bow-of-Cupid lips were drawn up as if just about to discharge an arrow as poisoned as any the far-darting Apollo directed into the offending Grecian camp, in the first book of the Iliad. One might really almost say, on the whole, the Beauty was forgetful that she was by far the handsomest young lady present of the flowering charms of Liver pool, and that her violet velvet hat and plume were by far the prettiest, look where you might over the fashionably-attended scenery.

Try whether he could not make her wretched, too, if even she did not care for him at all ; only for the effect of her cruel, maddening ways of going on upon a fellow ! And so, in his turn, he set to work responding to the widow's well seasoned coquetry with a sudden vivacity of response or acceptance, which considerably flustered her, and excited Aleck's alarmed, though remote observation in the manner de scribed. Adelaide also looked surprised and affronted, and bit her pouting under-lip until it red dened almost as if it had been stung by a wasp. Nevertheless, she remarked, with another disdainful toss of her head \u2014 \" I am sure I don't care \u2014 and I don't see why you need.

For at the moment the widow let her prettily laced handkerchief fall, in drawing out her purse, and Tom, studious of his intended effects, having gallantly raised it, was declaring he would wear it at his breast pocket as her colours for the day; and the widow, now seriously interested and very highly coloured up, was declaring \u2014 \" No, no, you shan't, Mr. Souchong ! people"], [174, "166 A PROPOSAL ON THE LADY'S SIDE. would notice.

It had the redemption, however, of being in its origin of an infinitely nobler and more ex alted delirium of fancy, like that of the heroic lunatic of La Mancha. All her life had Mr. Featherstone's youngest niece fed on a sort of mental opium of romantic reverie, and had figured to herself an ideal of chivalrous honour, love, and intellect in a being of the opposite sex of which a conjuncture of circumstances now seemed to place before her the realization. If gazing at the stars so raptly she had fallen on a dunghill, the contrast haunting her only added to the force and splendour of the novel halluci nation, which no test of actuality had yet touched. Even the fact that nearly the whole of that close and earnest conversation, which Mrs. Bagnigge Wells misinterpreted, after the man ner of the Mrs. Bagnigge Wells's in general, and in particular always, to the Countess de la Mazurka, related to the dead wife of Mr. Pen dragon, had not slackened the zeal of fond at tention with which Rosanna listened to all he said. It is true that there was also a vague piercing"], [180, "172 THE CLIMAX OF THE TH_5 DANSANT. of the acutest pain throughout the pleasure that wandered like a circling stream in all the founts and conduits of that capacious heart. But it seemed beautiful to know a man who had loved so fondly and purely that when nothing re mained of the partner of his youth but a fine recollection and a well-executed monumental marble, still dwelt with such pertinacious idolatry on his vision of the past. All that was lovely, refined, and nymph-like, delicate and pure in woman's nature, Mr. Pendragon ascribed to this beloved memory. Heaven knows whether or not, by some similar delusion of the ima gination, for Mrs. Pendragon had died very young, of consumption, after endowing her hus band with his numerous progeny, and while his own heart was still in the full strength and glow of its earliest love. There seemed, how ever, something so glorious \u2014 so like the un dying and unearthly flower of passion of which Rosanna had dreamed in her love-born fancies of old \u2014 in all Mr. Pendragon said ! And she was brooding on the thought \u2014 \" Can so large a heart be exhausted in one overflow, or even the gradual trickling of time ? If he could perceive"], [181, "THE CLIMAX OF THE THE DANSANT. 173 that mine is at all worthy of his \u2014 could he reciprocate the feeling? But it is too late to hope : all is over for me ! Still, to love and honour him above all men may yet be within my scope !\" when the mischievously lively Char lotte crossed their path, and insisted on expound ing one of her oracles to them. And how was Rosanna hurt and brought down from her flight when Mr. Pendragon turned away quite discom fited and evidently taken all aback, begging her to excuse the young girl's ridiculous non sense \u2014 it was quite surprising how senseless girls of that age were in everything ! And immediately after began to talk again of his mines ; but not until Rosanna had taken into her bosom, sharp as the stroke of a stiletto, the look of utter wonder and want of foundation to the possibility of anything of the kind surmised, on his part. In recompense, however, for her timid an nouncement that she should like to devote some little savings of her own to shares in a specula tion so likely to turn out a good investment, Mr. Pendragon politely declared it would give him the greatest pleasure if Miss Clanbrassey"], [182, "174 THE CLIMAX OF THE THE DANSANT. would honour Pendragon Mohr with a personal inspection, to satisfy herself of the capabilities of the ground. \" My daughters, Isa and Helena, are both at home, and will be delighted,\" he remarked, adding, with rather dry emphasis, \" and they are quite grown-up young ladies, for I am old enough, Miss Clanbrassey, to be a grandfather ! Only I do not wish my young people to get married until their position in society is more assured, or until I can establish them to my satisfaction, on the success of my grand venture. Trevohr, my eldest son, is in the Guards, and sadly in want of his step being purchased for him, so we are all on the save at Pendragon, and see hardly any society. But if your own life is so quiet as you mention at your uncle's residence, Miss Clanbrassey, you will be able to put up for a few days \u2014 or weeks, if you can favour us so far \u2014 with the dulness of our mountains.\" \" It will be a great change for me, and I should enjoy it above all things,\" said Rosanna, most certainly believing so, until a deadly twang of recollection crossed her mind, and she added"], [183, "175 THE CLIMAX OF THE THE DANSANT. \u2014 \" If my uncle can spare me. But I really manage almost everything for him now, with the help of a person who \u2014 who thoroughly un derstands farming and the management of pro perty, from Scotland !\" And there was something of such profound, heart-crushed sadness and gloom in the expres sion, that Mr. Pendragon was surprised, and was about to say he hoped Miss Clanbrassey had had no bad news since her visit from Featherstone, when Jimmy Reade thrust his unsightly figure upon their view, with his screeching demand for a charitable contribu tion. \" Gracious me ! what does the man say ? How can a ragged lunatic like this have got into the grounds?\" exclaimed Rosanna \u2014 but received a good deal more information than she had bargained for, or relished, in reply. \" I'm Jimmy Reade !

Oh, somebody \u2014 Aunt Rosanna, do, for one moment, look out for papa ! I am sure this old fellow means mamma mischief!\" said Aleck, following vigorously on, and determined it should be at some peril to the old lunatic himself if he attempted any. \" I'll go on \u2014 but you had better find out Mr. Marrynett, I do think, Miss Clanbrassey !\" said Mr. Pendragon, striding forward also to the rescue. \" There he is ! I will go and tell him there is an escaped madman, evidently, broken in !\" re plied Rosanna, and at the moment, in reality, Mr. Marrynett emerged from his mansion in anxious pursuit of the exasperated mendicant. \" Dear me, Primmer ! how stupid of you to"], [185, "177 THE CLIMAX OF THE THE DANSANT. be lugging the baby out of his cradle, and asleep, which would do him much more good, I am sure !

And per haps my child was killed to make way for this proud jade !\" Jimmy Reade responded, looking so wild and revengeful that Mrs. Marrynett gave a faint scream, and rose as if to run away. But, meanwhile, the imprudent Aleck, alarmed for her mother's safety, clutched the excited old man by the collar of his ragged old coat, and quite tore"], [187, "THE CLIMAX OF THE THE DANSANT. 179 him down the two or three steps that ascended the pavilion. \" You shan't hurt mamma, whatever people have done to you, you horrid old man !\" the fearlessly impetuous girl exclaimed. \" What ! tear my old rags off my back, would you, her daughter; would you, her daughter?\" yelled Jimmy Reade ; and stooping to his burst boots, he suddenly drew out a long back woodsman knife. It glittered in the air high over his head, and might have descended with fatal consequences, either on the unshrinking- Aleck, or her terror-stricken mother, in the insanity of the moment, had not a strong arm suddenly clutched the old man's weaker one, and Tom Souchong appeared like a deus-ex-machina on the scene, in the nick of time. \" You scoundrelly old coward, you ! let that knife go, or I'll wring your head off its wizened old neck, I will !\" he exclaimed, and by a vigor ous wrench secured the weapon.

Not, I should say, while I have fifty thousand pounds of my own hard-earned money to keep me out of one !\" People absolutely burst out into a peal of laughter, notwithstanding the general tragic environments of the scene, at this statement on the part of the ragged old mendicant, which, with his appearance, would alone have sufficed to establish his insanity. For himself, he sunk down on the pavement of the pavilion, in Tom Souchong's more relaxed hold, and began to sob and weep aloud most piteously. It was at this stage of the whole strange scene that Elizabeth Marrynett, hurrying from her vexed interview with Tobias Souchong, arrived. \" Good God ! what are you all doing to the poor old man ?\" she exclaimed, kneeling down beside him, moved with the deepest compassion, and taking his grimy old withered hand in hers."], [191, "183 THE CLIMAX OF THE THE DANSANT. \" Don't be afraid, grandfather ! none of them shall hurt you.\" \" They will put me in a pauper lunatic asylum, Elizabeth \u2014 they will !

It was owing to the zealous good offices of Mr. Tobias Souchong that a constable had been procured. He had, in fact, already taken upon himself the duty of procuring one, as soon as his disastrous interview with Elizabeth Marry nett concluded, determined that any disgrace or discomfort he could inflict upon her and her father now should not be lost, and resolved that the case should make a stir before the Liverpool magistrates. No pretext having as yet arisen but the returned convict's sturdy vagrancy on the Marrynett grounds. The policeman arrived with this convov, who had run half a mile to procure his services ; and Mr. Marrynett immediately gave the intruder in charge for being an escaped transport, and attempting to possess himself by violence and intimidation of certain moneys and other pro perty, on his premises. Elizabeth was, however, driven quite frantic by this rigorous proceeding. \" If you send my grandfather to prison, sir,\" she exclaimed, unblenchingly facing her irritated"], [193, "185 THE CLIMAX OF THE THE DANSANT. sire, \" I will go with him \u2014 and you shall cover your daughter with shame and disgrace as well as the poor old man, whom you have already wronged enough.\" \" Would she, though ? \u2014 would she, though ?'' muttered the old man, rising. \" Then I am ready to go to the world's end with my daughter's true child !

THE MOMENTOUS QUESTION. This affair of the convict beggar, and his frantic demeanour at Mrs. Marrynett's extensive party, of course made a great sensation in Liverpool. There were as many accounts of it as there were persons present to report, and everything was as exaggerated, confused, and falsified, as if it had been a matter of past history instead of living experience. Perhaps not two persons were agreed who the principal figurant in the pas sionate drama was. Mrs. Bagnigge Wells in formed all the people she met with, or could get to listen to her account, that she believed it to be some rascally foreigner connected with a sort of sham countess the Marrynetts pretended to have for a sister. Most likely the unknown"], [196, "188 THE MOMENTOUS QUESTION. and invisible Count, as it was notorious all foreign noblemen were mere \" humbug beg gars,\" who gave themselves titles at pleasure, because there were no peerages ever published abroad to find them out. And that he came to kill his wife \u2014 or whatever she was \u2014 no doubt for some shocking misconduct on her part, although foreigners were all so dreadfully jea lous. Mrs. Bagnigge Wells was enabled to state this most positively, from the circum stance of his having made a rush at her with a stiletto ! To do the Souchongs justice \u2014 at least the mother and eldest son \u2014 they did their very best to set the facts of the case in their true light. It was the old scamp returned from transporta tion without leave, who was the grandfather of Elizabeth Marrynett. Returned a complete beggar, and seemingly half, if not wholly, lunatic. But still nothing could be more brutal and inhuman \u2014 Lady Souchong declared \u2014 and even Tom joined her in that \u2014 than the recep tion the unfortunate old wretch had received from his late son-in-law. And as all the latter had was derived from the ill-gotten earnings of"], [197, "189 THE MOMENTOUS QUESTION. the ex-convict, nothing could be shabbier and baser (only Mr. Marrynett was capable of any thing that way !) than to refuse him some small allotment back ; and the old scamp had pro perly served him out by the exposure he had made. And further exposure even was now cer tain and inevitable. Jimmy Reade was to be brought up before the magistrates at the Town Hall next day, when explanations would have to be made that would put the whole transaction on public record. But, indeed, Mr. Marrynett seemed perfectly determined on pressing things to their fullest issue, in the hope of ridding himself for ever of the object of his dislike and apprehension. And Tymbell, the solicitor, whom he consulted at once on all the facts of the case, assured him, if it could be proved Jimmy Reade had returned without completing his sentence of transportation for twenty-one years, and without a colonial pardon, he would be consigned back again at once to Australia to finish his term of punishment. The colony had not, at that time, refused to be the mena gerie of our surplus criminal population. And"], [198, "190 THE MOMENTOUS QUESTION. in the case of a man of nearly fourscore years of age such a renewal was pretty well assured to be for the duration of his natural life. Mr. Tymbell was immediately employed, with the assistance of a Liverpool detective, in estab lishing the general facts requisite to bring about the desirable result described. Easy enough, as they were on record in the police and assize re ports of the town. Mr. Marrynett was probably even rendered only more implacably resolved on his course of vengeance by the opposition he continued to find in Elizabeth's entreaties and ex postulations. She had been taken into the house in her fainting fit while the old man was removed, Aleck being the only female member of the family who volunteered in attendance. \" I hate hysterics and stuff like that, and women needn't cry and go on, any more than men, if they didn't choose. But, hang it, Betsy behaved like a regular brick to me when I broke my arm, and I'll stick by her like one, too !\" the young girl said, apologising to herself for so much condescension to feminine weakness. But in reality, perhaps, Aleck's main motive was"], [199, "191 THE MOMENTOUS QUESTION. to escape out of Tom's sight, who seemed quite terror-struck by the passion of gratitude she evinced for his timely interposition ! She forgot for the moment the revelation that had lately taken place between them, and thanked him with such an overflow of loving admiration and delight, and with so much of her usual heedlessness of expression, that Tom was posi tively afraid she meant to make all publicly known, and quite shrunk away from her and her acknowledgments. As soon, however, as Elizabeth recovered under the skilful care of Mrs. Segrave sufficiently to attempt a renewal of her arguments and en treaties, she insisted on being allowed to see her father on the subject now uppermost in her mind. But, although the good meeting in Liverpool Palace had broken up completely in disorder after the catastrophe, and Mr. Marry nett had returned into the house, he sent her a reply in the most positive terms of refusal to hear another word she could say on behalf of that \" old vagabond and assassin, if he was her grandfather fifty times !\" \" Good God ! what can I do to save him,"], [200, "192 THE MOMENTOUS QUESTION. since my father is deaf to all reason and hu manity? Where's Ringold, Mrs. Segrave? He might advise us \u2014 I know he would for the best \u2014 though my father has behaved like a savage to him, too !\" exclaimed Elizabeth, quite distractedly. \" And I'm under notice to quit my situation and the house as soon as ever I can get another roof to shelter me in, or sooner if I make any delay ! And my poor boy, Ringold, will no doubt be turned out to starve with me when my scanty savings are exhausted !\" bemoaned Mrs. Segrave. \"My dear child, if you were to go and see him, or he come to you, we should all be thrown out of the window the same minute !\" \" Tell you what, Elizabeth, I'll go and see Ringold about anything you want to know. Though, perhaps it mightn't be right, either, as he is a young man and lives in lodgings by himself?\" queried Aleck, colouring, as certain recent con victions revived in some intensity in her mind. \" Still I'll do anything you think right, Betsy, because I know you know what is right. Shall I go?\""], [201, "193 THE MOMENTOUS QUESTION. Elizabeth replied with a most decided nega tive, murmuring, with a flushing cheek, to her self, \" She is not a beauty like Adelaide, but she is a thousand times handsomer than poor me ! And so brave and spirited, like himself!\" Luckily or unluckily, precisely at this mo- ment Mrs. Primmer made her uncomfortable appearance to announce that \" the head Miss Holloway,\" as the girls mostly called the prin- cipal in the educational establishment kept by the three ladies of that name, had arrived in a phaeton, hired on purpose, to convey the Miss Marrynetts usually under her charge there back to school, as had been previously arranged. Adelaide belonged to a higher finishing academy at a distance, but was to forfeit the remainder of her quarter to accompany her aunt to London. And Mrs. Primmer declared in her most pursed- lipped style, that Mr. Marrynett insisted the young ladies should set off without delay, and rid their poor mamma of the anxiety of their remaining, at such a time of trouble and con fusion. \" Goodness me ! and I promised poor Tom I would get him a talk with Adelaide, or at least VOL.

Only then lie will think that she is keeping him on to have him in the end, or that I am trying it on for myself! I had better let things al together alone, and let them take their own chance !\" Elizabeth was too agitated at the time to do more than take a hasty though friendly farewell of her hardy half-sister, and was then left to the counsels of Mrs. Segrave, who was herself at her wits' end, and in a state of maudlin whim pering and helplessness. The two poor women could conclude upon nothing now except that Mrs. Segrave should make her way to her son's lodgings, and relate what had occurred since his own grand climax, and find out what he thought could be done in the case, to the advantage of the old man."], [203, "195 THE MOMENTOUS QUESTION. But as soon as the elder had started as secretly as she could on the errand, Elizabeth was taken with a strange fancy that if she could get to see Mrs. Marrynett, and represent some of the bear ings of the case to her, such as the disgrace that would be certain to attach to the whole family from the exposure, she might by possi bility be induced to exert an influence \u2014 which was supposed to be restored in full vigour \u2014 to restrain Mr. Marrynett's headlong impetus of vengeance and rage. It is true that even in undertaking this busi- ness, Elizabeth already despaired of success. She was well acquainted with her stepmother's ill-feeling towards herself and all connected with her in general. And she was aware that the exposure she was desired to deprecate was in some sort a triumph over her and hers, which so heartless and revengeful a woman was likely to enjoy and urge on. Still no other resource seemed to remain ; and, taking courage from that circumstance, if nothing else, Elizabeth sent a message, as soon as she heard Mrs. Marrynett had come in, to ask if she would most kindly speak with her in private for a few 13\u20142"], [204, "196 THE MOMENTOUS QUESTION. minutes on a matter of the greatest importance, for which she would wait upon her in her dressing-room. Mrs. Marrynett was reclining on a sofa after a severe \" nervous crisis,\" as the Countess de la Mazurka described it, receiving all the attention that lady's numerous assortment of cordials and essences could afford, and the grim absent stare of Rosanna could render in addition from a chair at the window, whence a view could still be commanded of the fast dissolving The Dansant. Mrs. Primmer was besides rubbing the soles of her lady's feet, while Adelaide languidly waved a fan, more towards herself than her mother. And the former was de claring how glad she was she had coaxed the young ladies off without allowing them to bother their mamma by taking leave, when Elizabeth's message was brought in. Mrs. Marrynett quite raised her head from the pillow with surprise, as the servants' words reached her always pretty acute hearing from the door. \" Did anybody ever ! what can she want with me, the stupid stuck-up nose ? Thinks, does"], [205, "197 THE MOMENTOUS QUESTION. she, I am going to get myself into a row with Marrynett to save an old lunatic wretch from the hulks again, who has tried to murder me ?

I can't and I won't see anybody in my present dreadful state of nerves. And, if I could, I have made a resolution to have nothing to do in the affair, unless I am obliged to witness the old villain tried to murder me, because his daughter was dead, and I am sure nobody is sorrier than I am she ever did die !\" But meanwhile Elizabeth, in her eagerness to accomplish what she had in view, had hastened to the apartment usually occupied by Mrs. Mar rynett, and where she hoped she would give her an interview. The dressing-room opened on the great landing-place in Liverpool Palace, as well as the main rooms of the suite. And Elizabeth, en tering with a timidly venturesome step, thinking it likely her stepmother and her court might be in the bedchamber attached, made hardly any"], [206, "198 THE MOMENTOUS QUESTION. noise as she proceeded. But a nervous calamity to which she was subject, on occasions of great excitement, assailed her at the moment, in the form of a violent palpitation of the heart. And, made breathless and almost powerless for a time, she sank into a large dressing- chair, covered with white dimity, which was placed close to the door of communication beyond. This door, it so chanced, was ajar.

Here he joined them, and learned to his inexpressible astonishment \u2014 but not a little, it must be confessed, to his satisfaction \u2014 that Miss Marrynett was driven from her father's house and presence and goodwill, irrevocably, with scarcely as much money in the world as"], [245, "237 TRUTH STRANGER THAN FICTION. would pay for the vehicle which had conveyed her thence. When he learned the particulars of the ex pulsion, and its astonishing causes, which Eliza beth no longer concealed from either of her friends, the good-hearted young fellow's satis faction was really not diminished. Not dimi nished, although Elizabeth purposely even ex aggerated the excess to which she had provoked her father's indignation by the discovery she had made \u2014 or by the certainty that he was in the hands of the wickedest and most vindictive cabal that had perhaps ever made a private mansion the abode of desperate plots and in trigue, and whose villainous members had a vital and lasting motive to keep her removed, under the ban of her father's displeasure. Nei ther did the proud-souled young woman dis semble to her lover that she left her father's house under the slur of an infamous accusation, however false, and which might at any period be revived against her by the artifice and au dacity of her enemies. \" Well, then, my own Elizabeth, you only the more need a protector and a shield for your"], [246, "238 TRUTH STRANGER THAN FICTION. good name !

And before they took their way to the Town Hall, to do what could be done on behalf of the aged relative of Elizabeth, or at least to watch that he had fair play for redemption, Elizabeth Marrynett and Ringold Segrave had agreed to unite their fates, for better or for worse, as speedily as might be possible, in order to take advantage of the approaching departure of an emigrant ship for Australia, of which Ringold had already ascer tained satisfactory particulars.

The court was, however, now completely formed, and an officer was ordered to place the person accused at the bar. A tall, stout, strong-complexioned, elderly man, a sergeant of police, proceeded to obey the command. After a very much more protracted interval than had been expected, this officer returned, looking curiously pale and consternated. He leaned over the dock and whispered something to the mayor. \" Good heavens !\" exclaimed his worship, also with very considerable excitement. \" The unfortunate old wretch has hung himself, in an old ragged pocket-handkerchief, to the bars of vol.

NEMESIS. Never, indeed, was mortal man more com pletely amazed and discomfited with the results of his own conduct than Mr. Marrynett, when he came to consider his recent achievements in connexion with the catastrophe of the unfortu nate Jimmy Reade. He had treated his eldest daughter with the greatest contumely \u2014 dismissed, turned her, all but with his hands, out of doors \u2014 bade her go where she choose, marry whom she choose, or do worse \u2014 so brutish had passion rendered him !

Free to confer herself, and her money, on whom she might think proper, by"], [270, "262 NEMESIS. his own fiat and decree. And there was no doubt about whom she would think proper to confer herself and her money upon ! He him self had furnished his ex-clerk with the best imaginable opportunity of proving the disin terestedness of his attachment, and of dissi pating the suspicion raised to the contrary by other circumstances of the case, which had seemed likely to prove of so much advantage. He had exposed himself to the whole town for harshness of conduct to his only child by a mother whom he was also reported to have treated ill. Nor could he, without bringing on himself, and his, a scandal that would be sure to stick, plead in defence the excessive exas peration he had received from Elizabeth. And, though he did not \u2014 would not \u2014 could not \u2014 look upon the doubts cast on the genuine re lationship of his heir to himself, as anything but the last invention of malice and revenge, and detected criminality, on the denouncer's part, still even the slightest doubt on such a subject, was like the wandering of gout in the physical frame before it fixes on some precise locality for concentrating its agonies in. Nor did he dare"], [271, "263 NEMESIS. to seek explanations at the fountain-head. Mrs. Primmer assured him the bare hint of such a calumny would infallibly prove her poor lady's death. And, indeed, Mrs. Marrynett's disordered manner for days after the explosion testified that she was by no means in a con dition for reasoning on any subject. Yet, far from seeming afraid to tackle her lord upon it, Mrs. Marrynett went out of her way on all oc casions, as it were, purposely, to cross and do battle with him. So that the Countess was pretty correct in affirming that it was scarcely possible to find a more uncomfortable house than the Marrynetts' to stay at on a visit. To be sure, Mrs. Marrynett made an infinite deal more of the infant heir than she had ever done before, and lavished upon it marks of affection now quite sufficient to convince Solomon him self of the motherly tenderness she did and ought to bear it. And I have nowhere pre tended Mr. Marrynett was a Solomon in any thing but accumulating wealth. But that is certainly a great deal. The general run of events had also brought about a most unpleasant state of things in the"], [272, "264 NEMESIS. partnership concerns of Mr. Marrynett and the Souchongs. Sir John, at the instigation of his wife, considered he had the amplest reasons for dissatisfaction at the treatment his sons had sus tained, and were sustaining, from two of the \" Marrynett Girls,\" as he now scornfully styled them. Tobias was nearly driven crazy when he discovered the full extent of his pecuniary loss with that of his chosen bride. Tom was in the highest state of suffering and suspense at the conduct of his Beauty, who continued in an exemplary young-lady manner to keep him at his distance, and refuse all opportunity of private communication, until he was driven in despair to write to her by \" Miss Mercer's \" delivery at every hazard of interception. Knowing his own deficiencies besides, Tom hated writing; but he could not help himself, and concocted the epistle we have perused over the shoulders of the Countess and her niece, in the course of about a dozen efforts in the privacy of his bed-chamber \u2014 interrupted every third minute by his mother's coming in to make certain he was not \" doing himself\" a mischief. Then he awaited a reply in agonies of hope and"], [273, "265 NEMESIS. fear indescribable, without receiving one until late in the evening by the regular post, which, when it did arrive, put him into such a state that Lady Souchong was perfectly justified in removing his pistols \u2014 which she did, though afraid to touch them herself, by the medium of a stout-hearted young cook wench, who wasn't a bit afraid of gun-barrels, either end, and volunteered on the service, smuggling the weapons out of Mr. Tom's room under her apron. Yet, in truth, it was as civil and polite an epistle as a young gentleman, making such an offer as Tom had, could expect to receive, and by the medium of a lady whom he had called an \" old dragon\" and a \" French frog.\" But no one could often tell from the Countess's manner, or w7ords even, what she really thought. She had not spent the best part of her life in the most civili sing of societies and capitals to commit any disconvenance of the kind ! \" Madame la Countesse de la Mazurka\" pre sented her kind regards to \" Mr. Thomas Sou chong,\" and having been requested by her sister, who was too much indisposed to attend to busi ness at that moment (Madame thought this was"], [274, "266 NEMESIS. a capital hit, in a commercial community, to style a proposal of marriage \" business\"), she had accepted the duty of making a reply to Mr. Souchong's very obliging letter, on her part, as on also her beloved niece's, Miss Adelaide Marrynett, who of course desired to be guided in all things by her mamma's advice and de cision. Especially in so important a matter as she was given to understand had been submitted to Miss Adelaide Marrynett on the occasion. Though it could scarcely, in strict etiquette, be reckoned the proper way to commence by making a proposal of that nature to so young and inexperienced a lady. The parents were the proper parties to address in the first instance, Madame reminded \" Mr. Thomas Souchong.\" However, waiving these considerations, Mrs. Marrynett begged leave, on her daughter's part as well as her own, through the medium of the Countess de la Mazurka, to decline any species of acceptance or approval of an address so un supported by any of the usual claims to conside ration on the part of a young man whose own presumptuous (possibly) interpretations of the most ordinary friendly relations of social life ren-"], [275, "267 NEMESIS. dered it necessary he should be informed he had entirely mistaken the sentiments and wishes of Miss Adelaide Marrynett, who had no intentions whatever of entering into any species of engage ment with any one of the nature indicated. On the contrary, her parents were most anxious that she should see a great deal more of the world and of society, at her extremely youthful age, before forming any projects or conclusions on so infinitely important a subject. And it was in this view that Madame de la Mazurka was charged with the momentous duty of Miss Adelaide Marrynett's introduction to the world, which she should not for one moment think of undertaking, trammelled with so foolish and en tangling a circumstance as an engagement under which years must elapse before the commonest prudence would permit any hope of its fulfil ment to be entertained. Tom, however, did not kill himself, in spite of his mother's elaborate preparation against that catastrophe. He crushed his hat over his eyes in an awfully tragical manner, and rushed out of the house, and vowed that all was over for him in life. But Tobias refused to go after"], [276, "268 NEMESIS. him, to see that he did not drown or otherwise extirpate himself, telling his mother savagely that if he, who had lost fifty thousand pounds, didn't prussic-acid himself, she need not be the least afraid of Tom and his Beauty ! And the worst, indeed, that happened was that Tom was brought home late that night, admirably drunk, under the care of Captain Melton and some other of his barrack friends, who had con soled him in the best way they could under his afflictions, by assuring him, besides \u2014 in less polished language \u2014 that all women were regular jilts and humbugs, and always served fellows so unless they had plenty of money to waste upon them, and didn't care how much. And Captain Melton had pointed out to him, and thoroughly convinced him, that the only way to get on with the niece would be to court the aunt, instancing, his own success in that way in hundreds of cases, when the regiment was in Ireland and the West Indies ; until all grew7 blue about poor Tom, and he got into such fine spirits again that he in sisted on a dance round the table with every one, against all the humbug \" beauty-women\" in the"], [277, "269 NEMESIS. world, and fell insensible in the performance of the duty. A dreadful headache the next day further contributed to Tom's consolation, and kept him in bed the greater part of it. But to see her big, handsome boy suffering in this manner, and whimpering like a girl over the nice gruels and other refreshments his kind mother pro vided until he felt some reviving of appetite for a rumpsteak, did not contribute to soothe the Souchongs' feelings towards their partner, or any of his race. Mrs. Marrynett, on the other side, laboured at anything but conciliation. She looked upon the Souchongs as, in a great measure, the cause of her present unhappy condition, and hated them accordingly. Her bad word was never wanting for them with her husband. The household conspiracy took advantage of all this. Mrs. Primmer, whose low cunning was perfected by education and hard rubbing with the world, suddenly perceived an advantage in changing her tack \u2014 or thought she did. More over, she was alarmed by the fact that no sooner was the convict's catastrophe a little settled down,"], [278, "270 NEMESIS. than Mrs. Marrynett received a direct demand from Elizabeth, either to state her ground for suspecting her of stealing her diamond ring, or to retract the infamous accusation. A respect fully worded, but most resolute epistle, and which showed that a strong and clear man's head was guiding the action of that tremulous pen. Under these circumstances, Mrs. Primmer suggested, very plausibly, that it would be best to take a medial way, which she pointed out. It would not do to retract the accusation about the ring to Mr. Marrynett. But she represented to her master that in reality they had no proof, however much they might be convinced morally that Elizabeth Marrynett, under the stress to which she was driven, had unhappily yielded to temptation, and taken the article of jewellery. There was no chance now that an attempt at disposal of it would bring the proof home to the guilty parties. To persevere in the charge would, indeed, only be to give an opportunity, which was perhaps sought, to produce a counter- accusation, which, however false and groundless, would give so many people who desired nothing better than something to say against their supe-"], [279, "271 NEMESIS. riors, the opportunity to make the whole Marry nett family the jeer and jest of the town. The best way, she thought \u2014 and always had thought \u2014 in such cases, was to conciliate. It would cost them nothing to pretend to acknowledge that the whole affair had been a \" mistake\" \u2014 that the ring was not gone \u2014 that it had been found under a table-cover on the toilette, all right ! If somebody else had taken it (and there was no other proof, after all, except that the ring was gone, and Dr. Primmer and Mrs. Lillington had seen Miss Elizabeth's finger in a curious sort of skulking way in the mistress's jewel-box), then it was all right that the ac- knowledgment should be made, to set the young lady's mind at rest. If she had taken it, she would appreciate the delicacy and kindness dis- played in her acquittal. And either way would aptlv introduce a masterly suggestion Mrs. Prim- mer offered, that a proposition should be made to Miss Marrynett and her intended, no doubt, that the Souchongs should be discharged from the partnership, and Mr. Segrave admitted in- stead, by purchase, with a rateable portion of his wife's fortune !"], [280, "272 NEMESIS. Mrs. Primmer knew better than to believe that either the young man, or his ill-used bride elect, would incline in the least to this proposal. But she knew her master's arrogant belief that everything ought to, and would in the end, go to his pleasure, in everything ; and she trusted thus to get out of the difficulty regarding the ring, and at the same time keep the father and daughter at variance, by a renewed contravention of his will. All happened much as this good and kind hearted woman expected. Mr. Marrynett bit eagerly at the bait. He disliked the Souchongs very much himself now \u2014 and he had, in reality, no loves or dislikes that money could not soften or remove. Elizabeth was incontestably the rich old convict's heir. Her wealth was in her hands in the most tangible of all forms \u2014 in solid bars of gold. Even if his will was rather irregular, it was of no use attempting to upset it. In every case, Elizabeth would remain Jimmy Read's proper inheritrix. He had no other relative or descendant. Mr. Marrynett could not see his way to put in claims, on his own part, on the succession, or he might very probably have"], [281, "273 NEMESIS. tried the chances of the law in the case. All that was requisite was some suitable agent, and the despised old \" Mother Segrave \" herself was on a sudden called into requisition. She received a summons to \" Liverpool Palace,\" which she obeyed without acquainting her son ; in great inward tremor, expecting that some malicious scrutiny had been directed into her accounts as housekeeper, by way of annoyance. But was speedily relieved by the exceedingly affable and conciliating style of her reception by Mr. Marry nett. He even took the trouble to preface his over tures by expressions of great concern at the in judicious exposures which had taken place of family differences, and his great wish to come to a friendly understanding and reconciliation with his \" beloved daughter and future son-in-law.\" So he most graciously designated these once ob noxious personages, to the wondering and yet not much surprised old lady. And concluded by a declaration that the very best possible means to make up the \" whole stupid affair,\" and let people know that it was made up, was for \" young Segrave \" to accept a partnership in vol. if. 18"], [282, "274 NEMESIS. his house, in place of the Souchongs, whom he could and would turn out at a year's notice any day ! It was Mrs. Segrave's turn now to be demure and majestic, and she certainly took up a tone in this respect Mr. Marrynett had scarcely expected. She told him it was true that her son and \" Miss Elizabeth \" had agreed to marry, as soon as ever the latter had safely lodged their new fortune for mintage in London, and then in Government securities, and a respectful interval had elapsed of mourning for \" poor old Mr. Reade.\" But then they were going on a voyage for the benefit of Miss Elizabeth's enfeebled health, and because her son was so fond of the sea, to Australia. And if they found the climate favourable, they intended to take up a permanent residence probably there, as Miss Elizabeth was so cruelly cut up by the false ac cusation brought against her about the diamond ring, and the way she had always been treated by her stepmother, that she did not care even to live in the same country with such spiteful, lying enemies. And though she never would leave England till that matter was set to rights, and"], [283, "275 NEMESIS. would turn things upside down but she would prove the truth in it, nothing else \u2014 Mrs. Segrave thought \u2014 would have any attraction whatever to induce her to remain. Mr. Marrynett had thereupon much satisfac tion to be enabled to declare that that \" stupid affair \" was quite cleared up \u2014 the ring found again \u2014 and Mrs. Marrynett most anxious to re tract her annoying suspicions, provided Elizabeth would in turn withdraw her nonsensical invention about the little boy. Mrs. Segrave \u2014 who really herself thought that might well be simply an ef fusion of passion and excitement, and who had no great relish for a long voyage, or to lose the society of the two persons she loved best in the world \u2014 finally undertook the task of negociation in the manner desired. All, however, ended as might have been ex pected. Elizabeth replied in a tone of great filial respect \u2014 infinitely, indeed, more in sorrow than in anger; but informing her father that neither she nor Ringold Segrave had any desire to increase the large fortune the liberality of her unhappy grandsire had secured to her ; while, at the same time, it would be impossible for IS\u2014 2"], [284, "276 NEMESIS. them to reside with any satisfaction in Liver pool, while her father remained surrounded by persons who had so long devoted themselves to alienating the parent from his child, and who, by the crimes they had already committed, showed themselves capable of still more heinous atrocities. So far as regarded herself per sonally, however, a written retractation of the infamous charge against her would suffice ; and she left the rest to the justice of God, and the consciences of the wicked conspirators who had deprived her sisters of their just inheritance. Mr. Marrynett went into renewed ecstasies of rage over this communication, as had been anticipated by the contrivers of the plan, and determined from that moment and for ever to discard his eldest daughter from any further consideration or association as such. And Mrs. Marrynett went to the vulgarity of quite snap ping her fingers at the notion of her writing a retractation to the impudent, lying minx, who had in reality stolen herring ! And though the sagacious Primmer, wanting no discussion on the subject, easily pointed out to her the ad visability of writing a short, ungracious note to"], [285, "NEMESIS. 277 the effect required, she did not mention the concession to her husband, but left it to be in ferred that she held Miss Marrynett at defiance, to do her worst. Thus was the great object of keeping the merchant and his too-well informed eldest daughter asunder, in a state of hostile insula tion, assured, while every obstacle to so fortu nate a removal from the scene of action was cleared away. \" She will have no pretext for remaining and grubbing into things,\" said Mrs. Primmer ; \" and nobody knows what may happen to get quit of her altogether on her travels. There are the dangers of the sea, you know, ma'am, as my son says in his funny way \u2014 and she is a very delicate sort of an excitable, hysterical girl ; so, if she has any family, she may easily die of the very first little creature of her own. I am sure it will be a just judgment for her nasty, spiteful, mean listening to other people's af fairs ; or, as she is of such a jealous, suspicious nature, she may find out before long that she has bought herself rather too handsome a young fellow for a husband, to live at peace"], [286, "278 NEMESIS. with him, and so worry herself into her grave. On the whole, nothing could happen better than it's going to happen ; and, I am sure, I would not for one moment have started the idea of their joining our firm (!) if I had not known they would never think of such a thing. But just see how she must dote upon her bar gain ! Mrs. Segrave herself had the impudence to tell me, in a brazen of triumph, that the stupid creature has had a regular deed of gift made out, giving her fellow the half of her fifty bars of gold, that he may be perfectly free either to have or have her not still, to the last!\" \" I'd take my choice then, if I were Segrave, in a way she would not expect !\" said the un kind stepmother, who had grown positively to hate her husband's daughter, for having been injured and maltreated so long, and declining now to place herself in the way of a continuance of the same sort of enjoyment. It is perfectly true that sportsmen think the hare enjoys it too! The failure of the negotiation was, however, a great mortification to Mr. Marrynett. It was"], [287, "NEMESIS. 279 a real misery to think that he should have hu- miliated himself in vain. It is not so bad when thrift follows fawning ! Moreover, the plan leaked out somehow among people, and the Souchongs got to hear of it. It was a large drop in an already overflowing cup. Tobias Souchong was loud everywhere in com- plaint of his injuries, and made it out that he had been unhandsomely treated from beginning to end of the business, and that Mr. Marrynett had secretly encouraged the addresses of his clerk to his eldest daughter, by way of getting rid of her without a fortune ! As for Tom Souchong's wrrongs, they were patent and mani- fest to all the world, for he went on like a per- fect madman for weeks after, drinking all he could lay his hands upon, getting into rows and kick-ups of all sorts, and otherwise getting rid of the anguish of his mind, at every cost o it to his parents, and anybody else who took an interest in his welfare \u2014 including, decidedly, a certain young lady at school. The partners were thus coming upon an open rupture, and scarcely spoke except to diffe upon any imaginable plan of conjoint operations"], [288, "280 NEMESIS. Above all, Sir John refused \u2014 and in a rather singular manner \u2014 all art and part in \" rigging\" for the market Mr. Marrynett's grand specula tion in mines. \" I see what you are driving at, Marrynett, and I don't want to have anything to do in it \u2014 I don't think it will be a creditable transaction for anybody concerned in it \u2014 and I intend to wash my hands completely of it. Not but what Pendragon might as well be cleared out by you as anybody else, since he has gone mad on his mines. Only I don't see why I should wade in the mud after another man's pigs !\" The metaphor was not courtly, but it meant a good deal. Mr. Marrynett coloured indig nantly, but made no remark \u2014 only scored another long chalk against his uncivil yoke fellow. Meanwhile, the project to the advantage of Miss Adelaide Marrynett held good. The ar rangements with Madame the Countess de la Mazurka were definitively settled. The woman of rank showed herself by no means insensible to the advantage of money, in addition. To do anything for her niece worth while, she declared"], [289, "281 NEMESIS. she must have money ! She was obliged to confess that her own resources in that way were not extensive. Her brother, the Colonel, in spite of his present good financial position, seemed not to contemplate anything like ex- pensive housekeeping. She had taken a fur- nished house, it was true, in a fashionable part of the town, at a heavy rent, though shockingly inconvenient and uncomfortable, with a nasty mews behind. But nothing else fashionable was to be had at anything less exorbitant. Servants would be required \u2014 they ought to have a carriage and keep a decent table. The expense of masters in the various elegancies of society was necessary to prepare Miss Adelaide properly for introduction at the opening of the next campaign-season, Madame called it. She must have carte-blanche for dress : in short, the speculation threatened to be a costly one, and one might almost have thought, by the formi- dable demands she made, that Madame wished to frighten the Marry netts into a release from her engagements. But Mrs. Marrynett would not hear of that. It was the only relief to her remorse to scheme how to get her daughters"], [290, "282 NEMESIS. well married without the great fortunes they had once a right to calculate on. And a fever ish hope that her favourite Beauty daughter would make some great match in London, so as to throw a lustre on her whole family, and more than ever enable it to eclipse and mortify the Souchongs, had become the lodestar of her tempest-tossed mind. Mr. Marrynett was too much absorbed in his own anxieties and objects to cross his wife's fancies, and besides shared them in no slight degree. The pecuniary part of the question was, therefore, settled without much difficulty, and the Countess, being thoroughly weary of her provincial excursion, assigned an early period for her departure with her charge. Meanwhile, if anything rather amused her shallow, sarcastic spirit of observation, it was the progress of the singular affair between her sister, Rosanna, and the owner of the doomed Pendragon Mohr mines."], [291, "CHAPTER XIII.

And did you not then observe how he seemed to address to her exclusively his vindication of the vitality and susceptibility he retained, in spite of my playful allusion to his ungallant and un- sympathizing manner towards our sex in gene- ral? But, in reality, I have a notion that there is a good deal of fire under all that cold-flint exterior still ; but it may require the collision of sharp metallic surfaces to elicit it ; and the an- gularities of Rosanna's character may present the proper points of contact.

No mere hobereau \u2014 if even, as an aristocrat himself of the blue blood, he should not be disposed to respect her quality of sister-in-law to a rich citizen, merely his friend. It is perfectly plain, in short, that this W'elsh gentleman encourages the homage with which Rosanna surrounds him in her awkward, embarrassed way, and admits her at every visit he makes more and more conspicuously and unflinchingly into his confidence and inti- macy ! \" Perhaps, on the contrary, he may be trying to worm out our secrets from her ! That's what Marrynett thinks \u2014 especially since the puzzling affair of that horrid old suicide convict !\" replied Mrs. Marrynett, uneasily. \" He don't seem half so one-idea'd about his mines as he was \u2014 don't talk half so much of them as he did, I mean \u2014 So, perhaps, he is getting a little"], [299, "291 SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES. frightened now it is too late, and wants to make himself friends in the family. As if Marrynett would care a snap of his fingers if he were to propose point blank to Rosanna, and marry into the family half a dozen times over ! It would only please him the more to do a man out of his property that had made up to Uncle Feather stone's favourite niece, and was approved of by him.\" \" There may be something in what you say, my dear Charlotte ! Mr. Pendragon is not of course acquainted with all the ins and outs of our family feuds ; but he may well tremble at the notion of having placed all that remains of the inheritance of his children under the pounce of the vultures of commerce ! And he may fancy he is thus securing himself potent allies in the aerie; ignorant that in money-making, as in love, all is permitted and lawful that does not make in direct collision with the external decen cies of society ! Nay, I can believe, by the na tural enormous vanity of the male sex, that this Welsh widower may feel a certain degree of flattery and intoxication in becoming the object of the attachment of a person who, with all her 19\u20142"], [300, "292 SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES. drawbacks, is much younger than himself, and seems to be admitted to be endowed with qualities of the mind that distinguish her from the herd of women who think to get married by mere force of desiring that result, and lose dis cretion in the eagerness of their plans to effect the object. All this I can imagine and concede; but how is it that having apparently made such favourable progress in her design, of a sudden, when success seems to respond to her efforts, Rosanna starts and stands stiff like a mule trudging up a mountain pass, that appears to dis cern some precipice yawn, invisible both to rider and driver, and to desire to retrace the whole journey rather than face it ? I know it for a cer tainty, since this very morning Rosanna observed to me, with a singular air of dismay and retreat, that, after all, she thinks she has done wrong to invite Mr. Pendragon to Featherstone, and that perhaps her uncle will be displeased with the liberty she would take in bringing a stranger's intrusion upon his reserved way of passing the time in that gloomy and scarcely accessible vil lage, while at the same time she feels it im-"], [301, "293 SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES. perative upon herself to make an immediate re turn there!\" \" Well, that's likely enough. Uncle Feather stone has moped and shut himself up in his own bounds till he has grown a perfect Wild Man of the Woods. So every one says. The sight of a human being, whose face he has not seen every day for the last forty years, might give him a mortal panic ! And then Rosanna confesses he has not in the least altered his notions about matrimony, and hates any one ever to dream of such a thing. And perhaps he was right, after all ! Any way, Rosanna will not like to run the risk of offending her uncle now for so mere a chance of catching a husband, after sacrificing the best part of her existence to his caprice of that sort. She is not the kind of person alto gether to lose the substance for the shadow. Still, I cannot believe she is in earnest in the pretences she makes of a withdrawal ! What can have occurred to change her views so mate rially on the sudden ? \" \" She had letters this morning from Feather stone, because she told me herself her uncle ex pressed his hope she would not exceed her week"], [302, "294 SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES. here on any account, as he don't get along at all well with his Scotch bailiff, or understand his notions of management, which she seems to do so well. But what a good deal more excites my consideration,\" the Countess continued, with an air indeed of immensely profound reflection, \" is the circumstance that Eugenie tells me her aunt asked her to show her the way to the post office, and went out alone this morning, and paid a visit to it, as if she expected some com munication she did not choose to be addressed here, and subjected to a possible scrutiny. I could understand this indeed of missives so likely to contain unpleasant expressions with regard to your family, as Uncle Featherstone might indite ; but she receives his epistles in due course, and apparently without apprehen sion here, while she goes to the post-office in search of a further portion of her corre spondence. What are we to understand by this ?\" \" Can she have played uncle already a trick, and have a lover unknown to him ?\" suggested Mrs. Marrynett, nee Charlotte Clanbrassey. \" It is not in the least likely, dear. WThat"], [303, "295 SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES. lover could she possibly pick up at Featherstone Haugh ? Dr. Malton's curate there is quite an old man, I am told, with a family and a wife. In the way of strangers, not even a commercial traveller used ever to penetrate there, in our time, you remember, unless it was a married grocer in his gig. Besides, I must tell you, that being surprised at what the little girl men tioned to me, accounting for her aunt's absence at breakfast, I was induced to make my sister rather a sudden and unannounced visit in her room ; and I found her sitting with an open letter in her hand, staring at vacancy, in such a curious, mesmerised sort of a manner, I was quite alarmed. And when I could not help making a little exclamation, and hoping and trusting she was not ill, she gave such a jump, as if she had been asleep with her eyes open ; and shuffled up the paper as fast as she could, colouring up you never saw such a sight \u2014 such a curious mixture of red and yellow ochres ! But before she could twist it up I plainly saw it was not at all in Uncle Featherstone's hand writing. A big, round, schoolboy sort of a handwriting it was. You know how people"], [304, "296 SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES. write that have not been brought up gentlemen \u2014 nor tradesmen either. Tradesmen write finer in the strokes, and with a smoother sort of run to the right.\" \" Perhaps it was from that bailiff man at the Haugh. I believe he sends Rosanna word about everything that's happening in the farm ing way \u2014 every egg that's laid, I daresay ; though I don't see why he should do it on the sly,\" commented Mrs. Marrynett. \" Now you speak of it, it did look like the writing of a man of that sort \u2014 they almost always seem as if they wrote with a hoof instead of a hand ! But why, as you say, should Ro sanna make a secret of her correspondence of the nature ?\" \" Wouldn't it beat everything, Flippy \u2014 now wouldn't it, if Rosanna has taken up in despair with uncle's Scotch bailiff? Oh, wouldn't that please Marrynett?\" said the amiable wife of that amiable gentleman. \" Oh, dear, Charlotte, how can you ever dream of such a thing? A low-born menial fellow, almost, like that ! The bare idea would break uncle's heart ! And is it in the least"], [305, "297 SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES. probable that Rosanna, who seems to me as proud and aristocratic in her likes and dislikes as ever uncle was himself, would take up with a mere head-servant of the kind, at last, on her own account ?\" \" At last ! Don't you see what a deal there is in that word, Philippina ? I don't think I should have taken up with Marrynett, for ex ample, if I had not felt convinced he was my last \u2014 my only chance \u2014 of \u2014 of a good match ! And how do you know ? The Scotch bailiff may be a handsome, red-cheeked, robust young fellow, with jolly, cheerful ways of his own to attract an old girl's attention ; and thrown toge ther so much as they very likely are, looking after uncle's ruralities, I should not in the least wonder. Far more improbable things have happened !\" \" Don't say any more about it, dear \u2014 so loud, especially ! Primmer seems to me always lurk ing about, listening to things.

The only thing I cannot in the least reconcile to probability is, that the old maid, Rosanna, should be possessed by such a quicksilver quickening of volatility and change, on a sudden, as to put her upon captivating an incontestably elderly widower the moment sue loses sight of this ruddy country youth you describe to me, and who must have played so successful a part in ' Love in a Vil lage,' as to persuade a woman of her age and appearance and profound sagacity, that he has conceived one of those bucolic passions for her which Virgil and Theo \u2014 Theo \u2014 what's the other name? \u2014 have transmitted with celebrity from"], [307, "299 SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES. the Golden Age to ours\u2014 which is ' golden' in a very different sense. Yet again, as you make the suggestion, it is certainly true that Rosanna made me the confidante of the apprehensions she entertained of her uncle's displeasure, on the very occasion I allude to, after the receipt of the letter in the big grazier hand! She even consulted me \u2014 with a compliment unusual from her, on my thorough familiarity with all the usages of society \u2014 how she could retreat, with out offence to the susceptibilities of Mr. Pen dragon, from the invitation she had so impru dently extended to him.\" \" And what did you say ? Would it be pos sible, Flippy ?\" \" It shall not be possible \u2014 I have a motive of my own in this ! But 1 hit upon a medium which I thought might release her from her per plexities, and at the same time facilitate an object I have very much at heart myself, I must confess. I told her it would be best for her to return to Featherstone, and merely mention to my uncle that I am about to make him a visit \u2014 which surely he cannot refuse to receive from a"], [308, "300 SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES. niece who has been separated from him for so long a period \u2014 and that, meanwhile, it should be arranged with Mr. Pendragon that he is to lend me the favour of his company and pro- tection in making his promised visit at the same time. I saw that she paid my coquetry the compliment of scarcely relishing the proposition, and Mr. Pendragon seems so strange a man, it is possible he himself may not altogether ap- prove it. Still he cannot in common civility refuse, and I shall thus be enabled to make my observations in a perfectly unsuspected and un- suspicious manner. But I must say that if I could but imagine for a moment that Rosanna \u2014 for the sake of some booby countryman's round red face \u2014 could be induced so far to forget what is due to her birth and station in society as to think of a connexion with a person moving in such a sphere, and so complete the disgrace and degradation (pardon me, Charlotte, for speaking the truth!) commenced by your roturier alli ance, I would \" \" Stop, I know exactly what you would do, Philippina ! you need not tell me.
