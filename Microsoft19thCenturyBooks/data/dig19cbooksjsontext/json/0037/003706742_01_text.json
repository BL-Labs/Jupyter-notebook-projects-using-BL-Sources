TELL you that you have no alternative but a miser- able existence of genteel poverty. The heir to a Baronetcy can hardly become a jockey or a groom. And I have yet to learn that you can earn your living in any other capacity. Besides; you are bound to keep the family name untarnished, and to revive the fortunes of the family.\" \" And to marry the daughter of a wealthy snob.\" \" We will not quarrel about phrases. I have felt it to be my duty to tell you the truth.\" \"A very bitter truth, uncle.\" \" Ruin is not pleasant under any circumstances, but it is most unpleasant when it means resigning all the luxuries to which one has been accustomed all one's life. Now, listen to me, Harry, for the last time, since the age of avuncular philippics died when Sheridan wrote ' the Rivals,' and the Prince Regent became an uncle. I have suffered heavy losses during my racing career, and you have not had any better luck. We won't cry over spilt milk."], [14, "6 Society Rogues. I am too old to understand the modern system of racing. Public stud-farms were unknown when I passed my turf matriculation. In those days gentlemen bred and raced their own horses, and knew nothing about yearling sales. But tout cela est change, and the old order has had to give way before the purses of stockbrokers and manufacturers. We may deplore the change but we are powerless to prevent it. We have to swim with the stream or sink ; and you and I will both sink unless you marry Gertrude Castor. Her father holds mortgages over this house and every acre of land appertaining to it, and he will foreclose unless you marry the daughter, in which case you will not have a penny to bless yourself with. Marry the girl and be rich, or do not marry the girl and retire into the ranks of the broken-down paupers, who live by clinging to the cast-off skirts of sporting society.\" Sir Archibald Stanford probably had never made such a long speech before in his life. Though he had never bred or owned a Derby winner, he had been one of the old-fashioned buttresses of the turf for nearly half a century, and unfortunately, like other old-fashioned buttresses, had reached the decaying process of existence. In other words Sir Archibald was a ruined man, without the energy to make any attempt to avert the ruin. His estates were mortgaged and the only straw left for him to cling to was the marriage of his nephew, Harry Stanford, with the daughter of his principal creditor. But as Harry Stanford will be a conspicuous personage in the pages of this story, it is unnecessary to describe his character at any length. He was a gentleman and a sportsman, but of the financial intricacies of sport he had no idea, a fact not to be wondered at since he had been brought up to consider himself the heir to a rich Baronetcy. At the same time it must be confessed that neither his best friend nor his worst enemy could have accused him of possessing any superabundance of intellect. Perhaps to this want of intellect may be attributed his aversion to marry Gertrude Castor. Sir Archibald, having delivered his ultimatum withdrew, so that his nephew might consider it at his leisure, though he added"], [15, "An engagement of convenience. 7 with an air of authority sufficiently powerful to carry conviction even to an oriental mind, that his nephew must declare his determination within three days. Now, both in real life and in the pages of fiction, it is a com mon thing for the scion of an aristocratic family to be ordered to redeem the family fortunes by marrying an ugly lady of un certain age, but of certain plebeian birth. The aristocratic scion invariably gains sympathy, though the intended wife may be young, beautiful, and intellectual. As a matter of fact, the aristocratic scion is generally a self-satisfied idiot until such time as the President of the Divorce Court, or a County Court Judge informs him that he is not worth the price which he places upon himself. Harry Stanford has described Gertrude Castor as the vulgar daughter of a wealthy snob ; but while he is pacing up and down the library at Stanford Hall considering over all that his uncle has said to him, it might be advisable to see what the lady is doing. Gertrude Castor was the only daughter of a millionaire. Her mother had died at her birth, and her education had been entrusted to hired governesses, whose object was rather to court the favour of the heiress than to instruct the pupil. John Castor was too much occupied with business and politics to pay much attention to his daughter. People said that he was an indulgent father, but his indulgence really was only a form of selfishness. He gave her whatever she asked for, because it was less trouble to him to sign a cheque than to say \" no.\" The result may easily be imagined, the spoilt child developed into a self-willed woman, who only lived for the pursuit of pleasure. She was now seated in her boudoir in John Castor's palatial mansion in Park Lane. The rarest exotics, the costliest Sevres, and the most delicate porcelain were scattered about in an elegant profusion, but in spite of these feminine surroundings, there was a certain sporting look about the room, which made the visitor wonder whether it belonged to a lady or a man. Portraits of well known racehorses and fashionable jockeys adorned the walls, and volumes of the Racing Calendar figured on the shelves of a"], [16, "8 Society Rogues. Chippendale book-case next to the novels of Surtees. A small cigarette cabinet was a conspicuous object together with a costly liqueur case. The writing-table was of the solid, useful kind associated with the study rather than with the boudoir, as also were the luxurious cushioned chairs, in one wf which Gertrude Castor was lounging with a cigarette between her lips, a hand some brunette of twenty, with full, red lips and bold, violet eyes ; her commanding figure and well-defined features were faultless, except that she generally created the impression that she was too big. Men admired her, but at the same time were rather afraid of her. \"She's a deuced fine woman, but there's about two stone too much of her,\" was the description given of her by Captain Dashwood of the Household Brigade, and the description though slangy was true. Upon this afternoon, Captain Dashwood was lounging in another armchair opposite to Gertrude. It was evident that the captain felt himself to be thoroughly at home, from the way he helped himself to refreshments, both alcoholic and narcotic. \" So the Stanfords are ruined, eh ? \" he asked in a listless drawl. \" So papa says. You ought to know, better than I do.\" \" The only marvel to me is that they have kept their heads above water for so long. I don't know what they buy horses for, I am sure. They don't buy them to win races with anyhow. When does your marriage come off ? \" \" I can't tell you, if only for the reason that the gentleman has not proposed. Perhaps he won't take the trouble to propose. So far the matter has been arranged between papa and Sir Archibald.\" \" So that you have not even had the pleasure of being made love to ? \" \"Not by Harry Stanford.\" \" I meant that of course. Well, it seems a funny game, but I suppose your father knows how to play it. Anyhow, we know how to play our game.\" \"We must take care not to expose it, that's all, my dear boy.\""], [17, "An engagement of convenience. 9 \"No fear of that, Gertie By-the-bye, I bought you that horse.\" \" That was good of you. And now, Tom, to business. I shall have a heavy settling day on Monday, and I don't like to ask papa for any more money yet. You must lend me some. I lost over five hundred to Mrs Delamaine, too, the other night.\" \" Why do you play with Mrs Delamaine ? She has had far more experience than you. Besides she plays to make her living and you only play for amusement. AVhat chance can you have against her ? \" \" I don't believe she plays fairly.\" \"All the more reason why you should not play with her. I should cut the whole of that set if I were you, for they are a shady lot,\" \"But they enliven me after these dull, political dinner parties; it may be very grand to be taken into dinner by a Cabinet Minister, but it is not very entertaining ; while, when it comes to staying in the same country house with one, it is almost intolerable. You will admit at least that Mrs. Delamaine and her set are not dull?\" \" Yes, I'll admit that ; but their company is expensive, and not particularly respectable. I don't suppose for a moment that Stanford will tolerate them.\" \" And do you suppose for a moment that I shall allow him to choose my friends ? Hardly. He might not tolerate you for one. Lend me some money and then I must send you away, for papa will be home soon.\" Captain Dashwood wrote out a cheque, as requested, and shortly afterwards left the house."], [18, "CHAPTER II. Two Interviews. N THE second floor of one of the dingy houses in Wine Office Court, Fleet Street, was the office of Mr. Howard Manisty, formally described as following the occupation of a novelist and journalist. The office like the building in which it was situated, was dingy in the extreme and the furniture resembled the office. Mr. Manisty prided himself that he lived amongst the shades of Doctor Johnson, Goldsmith, Boswell, and other heroes of a bygone literary epoch. He was familiar with the legends connected with \"the Old Cheshire Cheese,\" and unless rumour belied him, he was familiar with the modern contents of its cellars. Indeed, when he was in London Mr. Manisty was either to be found at his office or at the famous hostelry. He had lived in Fleet Street and on Fleet Street for fifteen years, and was known as a man who could and would, write any article of any length on any subject, at a moment's notice. Somewhere in the attics he had a dingy cupboard dignified by the name of bedroom, and it is doubtful whether Mr. Manisty would have exchanged these two rooms for the most sumptuous mansion in Park Lane. Not that Manisty was either poor or mean, He earned by his pen about fifteen hundred a year, so could well have afforded to move into more comfortable quarters. His purse was always open _o"], [19, "Two interviews. 11 to his less fortunate literary brethren, provided that he was assured of their industry. In his dress he followed the advice of Polonius : \" Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy, But not expressed in fancy.\" His features were marked by high intellect and strong deter mination ; and his physique was rather that of the athlete than of the student. Such was the man who had started life in Fleet Street at eighteen, with a five-pound note in his pocket, and at thirty-three was one of the powers of the fourth estate. Manisty was busy at his desk when he heard hurried footsteps on the stairs, followed by a loud knock at his door. \" Come in. My dear Stanford how often have I told you that that staircase is a venerable antique, and somewhat the worse for wear in consequence. I am afraid too, that the panels of that door are older than your brawny fists. However, sit down and recover your breath, and then tell me the reason of your in comprehensible telegram.\" Harry Stanford threw himself impatiently into an armchair, at the imminent risk of breaking it. \" Look here, old man, I'm in the very deuce of a mess.\" \"You generally are, or think that you are,\" was the calm rejoinder. \" What is the particular mess this time ? \" \" Ruin ! Utter and complete ruin, unless I marry a certain lady.\" \" In that case, you had better accept the alternative.\" \" Confound your exasperating coolness ! You sit there like an ink-slinging automaton, and here am I, half mad with worry.\" \"Wholly mad, I should say. Now, look here my good fellow, just calm yourself with a whisky and soda, and light your pipe, then we will discuss the details of the situation.\" Stanford followed the advice. He generally did follow Manisty's advice. It may seem strange that such a strong friend ship should exist between two such different characters, but it was only one of many instances where a schoolboy friendship has ripened into a life-long attachment. Stanford recounted the con versation which he had had with Sir Archibald, and stated his"], [20, "Society Rogues. 12 own aversion to marrying Gertrude Castor, in terms far from polite to the lady. \"And then look what people will say of me! I shall be pointed out as the man who married a vulgar woman for her money.\" \" What people say is of little consequence in comparison with what they do. Ruin to you, means that society will give you the cold shoulder, that your turf career, such as it is, will be at an end, and that your sporting pleasures will be confined to rat catching, or some such inexpensive pursuit.\" \" I could go abroad.\" \" Of course you could go abroad, but you could do no good if you went abroad, so you had better dismiss that idea from your mind. John Castor, for certain reasons which I do not pretend to fathom, has determined that you should marry his daughter, Sir Archibald agrees with him, and the lady appears to be indifferent.\" \" That's the worst of her. Her indifference is more galling than her vulgarity. She doesn't seem to have the slightest temper or will of her own.\" \" Most husbands would regard that as a convenience, I should think. However, we will leave the lady out of the question for the moment, and consider John Castor.\" \" A vulgar, purse-proud, rampant Radical ! \" \" Member for one of the divisions of Monopolis, and a man who has already made his mark in the House. Men, such as Castor, are now the ruling power in England ; therefore, it is a good thing for landed proprietors, when they wish to unite them selves by ties of blood with the old Tory families. Any objection you might have on the score of politics, would be absurd. Now we come to the saving of Sir Archibald and of your own inherit ance. Sir Archibald has told you that he is seriously involved, and that you can release him from his difficulties by marrying Miss Castor. The lady, as we have already seen is indifferent. Now, has it not occurred to you that if you do not marry her, Sir Archibald might be tempted to do so?\""], [21, "Two inlerz'iews. 13 \" Sir Archibald marry ! Why, he is seventy years old ! \" \" But hale and hearty, in spite of his age, and fond of luxurious living. Men of his age have married and had heirs before now.\" \" He would never make such a fool of himself.\" \" Excuse me, but I fail to see the folly. By this marriage, he would be able to redeem the mortgages on his property, and secure comfort for himself for the remainder of his life. Castor has evidently some deep motive for wishing his daughter to marry a Stanford, and unless I am greatly mistaken, he will see that he attains his motive.\" \" He only wants the Stanford estates.\" \"Which he can have to-morrow; so you say that Sir Archibald told you, so that cannot be his motive. Now, Stanford, you may think me devoid of all honourable sentiment, but I only tell you what every sensible man would tell you, when I say, marry this lady. So far as I understand, neither of you are in love, The marriage is a mere business transaction, from which you get the greater profit. I am busy now, so must ask you to excuse me. I never have my meals at home as you know, so breakfast with me to-morrow morning at ten sharp, at Anderton's Hotel, and in the meantime think over what I have said.\" Manisty mused for some moments after he had thus uncere moniously dismissed his friend before continuing his work. \" What does it matter ? \" he muttered to himself. \"Everybody would have given him the same advice. Sir Archibald is ruined, and in the power of John Castor ; but why John Castor wants Harry Stanford to marry his daughter I can't understand. How ever, I suppose I shall know soon.\" The entrance of a visitor put an end to his musings. \" Why, Dashwood, it is not often that Fleet Street is honoured with your presence. What's in the wind now ? \" \" Nothing much. Have you heard that Sir Archibald Stanford is on his last legs ? \" \" I have heard that he has not had the best of luck on the turf \" \"And is going to marry his nephew to Miss Castor ? \""], [22, "Society Rogues. 14 \" I didn't know it was settled yet. You know John Castor, what does he think of the engagement ? \" \" My dear fellow, that is the very question that I have come down here to ask you. At all events for some reason or other, he has set his heart on the marriage, worse luck.\" \" I always thought you were the favoured suitor.\" \" Not a bit of it. I have known Miss Castor since she was in the school-room. I taught her to ride, and all that sort of thing, but old John would never have me as a son-in-law.\" \" I see ! You may ride his horses and arrange his shooting parties, but you must not make love to his daughter.\" \" Well, I suppose that is the truth of the case, though you state it rather brusquely; but though I'm not conceited, I don't see that I am vastly inferior to young Stanford from a matrimonial point of view. I know he is a friend of yours, so I won't say a word against him, but you must allow that a penniless gentleman who has lost his little all on the turf, is not a model son-in-law. Besides, John Castor knows that he is a gambler. Then Stanford hardly ever comes to Castor's house, and knows next to nothing of his bride eleat ; and when he does come, he takes no notice of her.\" \" So this marriage will be a mere business transaction between Castor and Sir Archibald. By-the-bye, what sort of a girl is Miss Castor ? \" \" Some people would call her fast, but that is only because she is keen on hunting and racing. There's no vice about her, so long as she has her own way ; but if you were to give her the whip she would probably kick over the traces. She is fond of a gamble, so the turf won't lose a patron.\" \" You evidently regard the match as a. fait accompli.\" \" Certainly. Stanford has only to propose and to fix the happy day.\" \" But suppose that Stanford does not propose ? \" Dashwood opened his eyes in astonishment. \" I should say in that case that he was matriculating for Colney Hatch. But the supposition is ridiculous.\""], [23, "Two interviews. 15 \"My dear fellow, the ridiculous in this world is not only possible but probable. Now, suppose that John Castor knew that Stanford disliked his daughter, what would he do ? \" \" Send him to the deuce, or rather into the Bankruptcy Court. Great Scott ! man, if John Castor can persuade his daughter to accept a man whom she hardly knows when she could have scores of men at her feet, it's not likely that he would stand any nonsense from a pauper like Stanford. Then Sir Archibald is rather an autocrat isn't he?\" \"Yes, and as proud as Lucifer. That is what makes me wonder at the arrangement, for Sir Archibald must be deeply in Castor's power, before he would ever consent to the match.\" \" Now he will be able to start a fresh racing stud,\" \"And to lose more money.\" \" I doubt that, if he takes Miss Castor's advice.\" \"Which means the advice of Captain Dashwood, who will have no objection to managing his stud.\" \" And telling his friend Manisty the secrets of the stable, if Manisty will use his influence at Stanford Hall on his behalf. Is it a bargain ? \" \" Yes, I will do what I can, but Sir Archibald is obstinate.\" \" Never mind, we will overcome his obstinacy between us. Come out and drink success to the racing partnership of Manisty and Dashwood.\" When Dashwood left Manisty, the latter returned to his chambers to think over the new and strange partnership which he had entered into. It was an honourable one at all events, he thought. Stanford was not clever in regard to turf matters, and Dashwood was, therefore it would be to Stanford's benefit to have the assistance of Dashwood, and he would really be doing Stan ford a good turn in gaining for him Dashwood's assistance. As for his learning the stable secrets, Stanford would tell them to him in any case, so nobody could say that he was guil'y of under hand conduct. But the marriage, the necessary prelude to the racing partner ship ! That must take place, and the sooner the better. He"], [24, "16 Society Rogues. must persuade Stanford at breakfast to propose at once. He need not tell him that he was mistaken in his opinion of Gertrude. He would find out his mistake in good time. \" Still I doubt if Dashwood's friendship for the lady is quite as platonic as he would have me believe,\" he said to himself as he began to dress for the evening. But Manisty was a philosopher in the ways of the world and knew that friendship between man and man stops short at the point when a lady enters into the case. Perhaps like Gringoire, he thought that in love affairs, more especially in matrimonial love affairs, the lover should resign himself to temporising and to middle terms. But though Manisty held in ridicule the mousquetaire style of love which carries the lady by assault, he \"was a believer in that violent style of persuasion which carries conviction to the listener ; and this style he put in force on the following morning when he met Stanford at breakfast, with the result, that the latter promised to propose without delay. \" If it's got to be done I had better get it over at once,\" he said. \" I'll call at Park Lane this afternoon.\" \" The wisest thing you could do.\" And so in the afternoon, Harry Stanford proposed, and was duly accepted. It was a prosaic proposal certainly, but it answered the purpose of all parties concerned."], [25, "CHAPTER III. After the Honeymoon. TANFORD HALL had only one drawback. It was t0\u00b0 large for its owner. Sir Archibald had inherited the house and property from his father ; but though he made it his headquarters during the shooting and hunting seasons, many of the rooms were never used. The original structure had been added to by different generations of Stanfords, according to their own fancies, and without any regard to the recognised rules of architecture. The red brick of Queen Anne stood comfortably leaning against the black and white gables of Elizabeth, and ivy-clad stone nestled fondly against Grecian stucco. It was a splendid house in which to play hide-and-seek; but if you were a strange guest, trying to find your bedroom, you might find yourself in the same predicament as the illustrious Mr. Pickwick was in, at the Great White Horse, at Ipswich, and though curl-papers and nightcaps have gone out of fashion, still, the consequences might be awkward. To enter any room you either went up three steps, or down three steps; if the former, you barked your shins, if the latter, you broke your nose. In either case the spectators would be amused, so that it really was a very pleasant house to live in. It was built on the side of a hill, round which it curled like a crescent. The river Stan flowed at the bottom of the hill, and on the other side was the little agricultural town of Stanford, whose title to fame consisted of being the nearest town to Mr. Hendon's training stables. 17 B"], [26, "18 Society Rogues. To Stanford Hall, Harry Stanford brought his bride at the beginning of November, after a brief honeymoon ; but brief as it was, it had been sufficient to show the husband that his wife had both a will and a temper of her own, and that what he had con sidered indifference, was in reality, only indifference towards himself. She had told him plainly that she intended to be master as well as mistress of Stanford Hall. John Castor had taken care that she should be the real owner, for instead of making Sir Archibald a present of the mortgages, as Sir Archibald had thought that he would do, he had merely settled them on his daughter. Sir Archibald was only the guest of his nephew and niece, and was in the historic position occupied by King Lear, as he was not long in discovering. Gertrude, or Mrs. Stanford as she must henceforth be called, had no idea of coming home to an empty house after her honey- moon, and accordingly had issued invitations for a hunting house party, having previously commissioned Mrs. Delamain? to go down to Stanford Hall the day before the arrival of herself and her guests, to see that everything was in proper order for their reception. As Mrs. Delamaine had determined to be the amicus curia of the Stanford Hall establishment, it may be well to describe her. Few people meeting her for the first time, would have detected in the pretty, fragile, fair-haired little woman, a scheming adventuress ; her soft, purring manners and youthful face were sufficient to disarm suspicion. Her widowhood made her interesting and excited pity, while her blue eyes looked at one with plaintive innocence ; but beneath this fairy surface was a heart as hard as flint, and a mind which can most fitly be described as the incarnation of selfishness. Such was the woman whom Mrs. Stanford had chosen as her intimate companion. The house party at Stanford Hall, was of a heterogeneous character, the single exception to the heterogeneity being a love of hunting. Amongst the guests the only one who was a friend of Harry Stanford was Howard Manisty, and he would not have received an invitation, if it had not been for Captain Dashwood. Gertrude had never met him until her wedding day, when she"], [27, "After the honeymoon. 19 had an instinctive feeling that he would be her enemy, and she conceived for him one of those sudden dislikes, which like sud den likes, are seldom ever eradicated by second impressions. In reality, she was afraid of him ; while he regarded her as the living type of an interesting social problem, and was idly curious as to how the problem would be solved. \" How far is it to the meet, to-morrow, Harry ? \" Mrs. Stanford asked as she lazily sipped her tea. \"A good ten miles, so we had better drive. We shall be a large party, so must take the drag.\" \" Very well. I like driving four horses,\" the wife replied in a way which told her husband that she meant to handle the ribbons. \" H'm ! do you believe in ladies driving four-in-hand ? \" Sir Archibald interposed. Mrs. Stanford raised her eyebrows in apparent astonishment at the question. \" My dear Sir Archibald, certainly I do, if they know how to drive,\" then she turned away to talk to Captain Dashwood, as if the matter were disposed of. But Sir Archibald had no intention of being snubbed by his daughter-in-law without making a protest. \" I disagree with it emphatically, if only for the reason that no lady is strong enough to manage four horses. Besides, in this part of the country it is not considered good form.\" Gertrude's eyes flashed dangerously. \" What antediluvian ideas people in this part of the country must have. However, I dare say they won't prove to be incurable, for the conventionality of country cousins is intolerable, don't you think so, Laura ? \" Mrs. Delamaine thus appealed to, was obliged to agree with her patroness, though she qualified her opinion by adding, \" But I suppose when one is in the country one must study the conven tionalities. \" \" Then I shall be a bad student,\" Gertrude rejoined. \"You look quite shocked, Sir Archibald. Are you really a believer in the importance of being earnest ? \" \" No ; but I'm a disbeliever in ladies driving four-in-hand.\" D 2"], [28, "Society Rogues. 20 \"What a pity! Won't you trust yourself in my hands to-morrow ? \" \" Certainly not.\" Gertrude bit her lip, and Manisty said sotto voce to Captain Dashwood. \" That's one for her. Don't let there be an open rupture.\" Captain Dashwood knew that he had a difficult part to play. On the one hand he wished to gain the confidence of Sir Archibald so as to have the control of his racing stable. On the other hand, he must retain his influence over Gertrude, whose temper as he knew could be violent in the extreme. His object therefore was to promote an alliance between Sir Archibald and Gertrude, but how natures so entirely opposite to each other, could be reconciled was to him a problem difficult of solution. But the captain was an adept at social finesse. Acting on Manisty's hint, he immediately struck into the conversation to put an end to this storm in a tea-cup. \" For my own part, Stanford, if you've no objection I should prefer to jog quietly to covert. I always prefer riding to driving to the meet. What do you say, Manisty ? \" \" That I will ride with you, if it won't upset Mrs. Stanford's plans.\" \" I'll ride with you, then,\" Harry Stanford said, glad for an excuse to avoid the ignoble position of being driven by his wife. \" I hate driving to covert except in a dog-cart.\" Gertrude looked from one speaker to another, but none of them cared to meet her eye. \" And are we to drive to the meet, or to ride with you ? \" \" Whichever you like,\" Harry Stanford replied with assumed indifference, for he knew well the nature of the private interview which would follow the discussion. Indeed, he was not quite certain that his wife would not now create that worst of abomina tions to the male sex, namely, a scene. But Gertrude, in spite of her outspoken disdain for the conventionalities of society, knew that to create a scene, would be considered bad form : not only by Sir Archibald and Captain Dashwood, but even by Laura"], [29, "After the honeymoon. 21 Delamaine and two others of her set who were at the present time guests at Stanford Hall. So she merely shrugged her shoulders and remained silent, or made monosyllabic replies till the dressing-gong sounded. How Harry Stanford got into his dress clothes, and how he manipulated that most crucial event in diurnal sartorial history, to wit, the tying of his white tie, are enigmas which he solved without afterwards being able to give any explanation of the solution. To use his own expression, he had a deuced bad time of it. But as Harry Stanford was a gentleman, he did not allow his most intimate friends to know the details of the connubial controversy. Still it is easy to hazard a guess. The possession of money by the wife and the want of money on the part of the husband, will make the wife say, that she who pays the piper has a right to call the tune. Probably she will not use the language of epigram, but the meaning is the same and more easily understood. Yet Gertrude had an instinctive idea that she was not as powerful at Stanford Hall as she had thought. The men, even including Captain Dashwood, ignored her, and only showed her those outward signs of deference which the guest is bound to show to his hostess. They made her feel that she was a parvenue and she hated them for it. In a word, Gertrude was the most unhappy person at her own dinner-table. But the sequel to the dinner was more humiliating to her than the dinner. Gertrude, as has been seen, was a confirmed gambler, but her experience had not taught her, that high play is tabooed at country houses. Men like Captain Dashwood, a daring plunger on the turf, and one of the best known whist players in Clubland, hesitate to play openly for high stakes with ladies, for fear of earning the reputation of being peripatetic card-sharpers. They have their race-courses and their clubs, and the excitement of drawing-room gambling to them is as mild and insipid as flat ginger-beer. They regard the introduction of roulette or baccarat into the drawing-room, as an unmitigated infliction, only to be compared with the invasion of a railway carriage by the three-"], [30, "Society Rogues. 22 card-trick gentry, on the return journey from Ascot or Epsom. So when the male guests at Stanford Hall entered the drawing room, and found a table already prepared for baccarat, to use a hunting phrase, they were inclined to funk the obstacle. After some delay, when Sir Archibald,- Captain Dashwood and Manisty had al! successively refused to make a bank, a Mr. Langton, one of Mrs. Delamaine's set, undertook the office. But the game progressed slowly. Although Mr. Langton started the bank at a hundred pounds, with the exception of Gertrude nobody staked more than a sovereign and at half-past ten, Captain Dashwood proposed the breaking-up stakes. \" A hunting morning to-morrow, Stanford. Late hours upset my nerves, excuse my saying 'good-night,' Mrs. Stanford. Early to bed, etcetera, you know the old proverb.\" And Dashwood dawdled into the smoking-room for a last cigar, followed by Sir Archibald and Manisty. \"Time we shut up, Gertie,\" Harry Stanford said, with authority in his voice, for he regarded Langton as a cad, though he added \" Coming into the smoking-room, Langton ? \" \" Don't hurry, Mr. Langton,\" Gertrude interposed. \"You may smoke here, and we can continue our game.\" Langton smiled, but it was a sickly, nervous smile, for he had seen a determined expression about Harry Stanford's mouth which he did not like. He stammered : \" Really, as Stanford says, it is getting late, and late hours don't improve one's riding.\" Harry Stanford meanwhile calmly rang the bell for the servants to put the lights out."], [31, "CHAPTER IV. On the Road to Covert. ONNUBIAL felicities have often been described by prominent novelists, under the title of curtain lectures. Most of us remember, and have probably practised Mr. Caudle's famous recipe for a curtain lecture. That philosopher said nothing through the medium of his tongue, but snored through the medium of his nose. As the latter argument was an impossible one for Mrs. Caudle to answer, the result was peace, harmony, and that sweet sleep, which, according to copy-book maxims, generally attend \" the just,\" though, as yet, we confess that we are unable to discover who \"the just\" may be, on this little wicked world of ours. We always thought that the Reverend Bartholomew Bottlemug, who published, under his own name, that classic work \" The Road to Eternity, or how Little Tommy won his Christmas Pudding,\" was one of the elite, till we had to prosecute him in the local County Court for his wine merchant's bill. But we are casting too forrad, especially as in these pages we may have to cast back to the Reverend Bartholomew Bottlemug. Nor should we have alluded to curtain lectures, which in the lower circles of life are generally attended with wife-beating or husband-beating, if it had not been for the appearance of Harry Stanford, at the breakfast table, on the morning succeeding the evening of his wife's discomfiture. n"], [32, "Society Rogues. 24 He presented the general appearance of a man who has been up half the night. His eyes were red and lustreless, and his hand shook as he poured out a glass of champagne. His usual cordial manner was exchanged for a brusquerie almost amounting to surliness, and he barely nodded in response to Dashwood's \"Fine hunting morning, isn't it, Stanford?\" Gertrude did not appear at the breakfast table, so Mrs. Delamaine took her place in front of the tea and coffee urns, while the men who were going to ride to covert, were soon busy fortifying themselves for the day's work, with mutton chops, devilled chicken, cold game, and the usual accessories to a hunting breakfast, which should rather resemble a light luncheon than an ordinary breakfast, as the hunting man requires strong sustenance to enable him to bear the fatigue of the day. Harry Stanford's ill-humour did not affect the appetite of his guests, or at least of such of them as were well-tried warriors in the hunting field ; still, silence reigned supreme, and nobody asked what the arrangements were for getting to the meet. Sir Archibald, Manisty, and Dashwood did not care, as they were going to ride over on their covert hacks, and knew that their horses had been already sent on, but the remaining guests, whose hunting enjoyment depended on Gertrude, were uncertain whether even they would hunt. Gertrude had merely sent down word that she was indisposed, and should breakfast in her own room, and nobody cared to question Harry Stanford, who evidently considered that he had fulfilled the duties of hospitality towards his wife's guests, if he were frigidly polite. But as soon as he has finished eating the hunting man is never contented until he is on his way to covert, so it was not long before Sir Archibald, Harry Stanford, Manisty, and Dashwood were on the backs of their covert hacks. Besides, Lord Cosford, the Master of the Cosford Hounds, believed like Mr. Jorrocks, that punctuality is the politeness of princes, and allowed little law to late comers. \" When I advertise that my hounds meet at a certain time I mean that they move off to draw their first covert at that time,\" he was accustomed to say; and he acted up to his"], [33, "On the road to covert. 25 dictum, as many a laggard had found to his cost when he turned up at the meet only to discover that hounds had found and gone away. \" How is Gertie coming, Harry ? \" Sir Archibald asked his nephew as they were riding alone in front of their two companions. \" I'll be hanged if I know whether she'll come at all now that she can't come on the drag. However, she ordered that brute Splendacious to be sent on this morning, so I suppose she will turn up somehow or other.\" \" Splendacious ! She can't ride that horse. Besides, we ought to send him to Hendon next week, if we want him to win any races this side of Christmas.\" \" So I told her, but I might as well have spoken to a hungry tigress. She said that she could and would ride Splendacious, and as for my racing arrangements that I had made such a fool of myself in the past that she intended to take the management of the racing business into her own hands in the future.\" \" The deuce she did ! What does she know about racing ? \" \" More than I thought. At all events, she knows the rules of betting.\" \"H'm!\" Sir Archibald muttered to himself rather than to his nephew. \"The Castor blood all over. Money, money; nothing but money.\" \"The curious thing is that Manisty, who never saw Gertrude till we were engaged, and whom Gertrude dislikes, says that she knows more about racing than any woman whom he ever met. By-the-bye ; what is your opinion of Dashwood ? \" \" He is a gentleman. Why do you ask ? \" \" Manisty says that he is the best judge of a racehorse, especially of a chaser in England. Indeed ; he hinted very strongly that we might do worse than enter into a partnership with him.\" \" He knows the modern game of racing better than we do. I am afraid that I am too old for racing now, Harry. I mean I am too old to take any active part in the management of a racing stud, and you have been educated by me according to the old rules. But the old rules are obsolete now, my dear boy. You"], [34, "Society Rogues. 26 are still young enough to learn the new rules, and I should say that Dashwood is as good a man as any other to teach them to you. However, I will talk to Manisty about him. There is one thing; he is in with John Castor and has known Gertie ever since she was a child.\" \" And knows how to manage her. I wish he would give me the tip how to do it.\" Sir Archibald looked at his nephew with a smile which would have done credit to Mephistopheles. \"You can't ride her on the snaffle, my dear boy. She wants a strong curb, and an occasional use of the spurs. You know the old proverb. 'A wife, a spaniel, and a walnut tree, the more you beat them the better they be.' Wife-beating has r;one out of fashion, owing to the departure of the age of chivalry, though the new woman seems likely to revive it. But a stern manner, my boy; a stern manner is the thing that is wanted, or else these modern women with their modern notions will abolish all the attributes of the female sex from maternity down to the subjugation which nature intended them to suffer. At the present time they merely promote the parturition of that insanity which is innate in the female mind.\" Harry Stanford laughed bitterly. \" You forget that Gertie holds the purse.\" \" Then rob her of it,\" Sir Archibald said with a stern and meaning accent. \" Drop back now and talk to Dashwood. I want to have a few words with Manisty. By-the-bye, tell Dash wood about Splendacious.\" But Harry Stanford had very little time to talk to Dashwood, as a short canter across a line of bridle gates with two or three of those small fences which farmers seemed to have erected in order to suit the requirements of the underbred ponies which nowadays are called upon to do the duties of covert hacks, prevented any prolonged conversation. Still Dashwood gathered enough to know that Splendacious was a horse likely to win money either across a country or over the sticks, but that he was a difficult beast to ride, and certainly not fit to carry a lady to hounds."], [35, "On the road to covert. 27 \" Look here, Stanford, I've only one plan to suggest,\" Dash wood said, as they came in sight of the Cosford hounds trotting quietly to the rendezvous. \" My mare, Stella, is a perfect lady's hunter. Change saddles at the meet, and I'll ride Splendacious. I know by repute that he is a nasty horse to ride, but I'll take my chance. If I can't manage him, then I'll trot quietly back to Stanford Hall.\" \" But my wife declared that she would ride him. I did my best to dissuade.her, but that only made her more determined than before.\" \" Pooh ! tell your groom to change the saddles directly we arrive at the meet. I'll be mounted and out of her sight. You comprehend. The trick will be done by that time. Lay the blame on my shoulders if you like. It will slip off, like water off a duck's back.\" \" Thanks ; I'll do what you say. Here we are ! I don't know where we shall draw first, but I expect it will be Budge Gorse. If it is, look out for squalls, for we generally cross Budge Common which possesses some open drains as formidable as an Essex dyke ; not the sort of country to ride a strange, bolting thoroughbred over, for choice. You know Cosford, I believe, the best M.F.H. in England. Gets away with his hounds, and is always with them. There's my groom ! I'll tell him to change the saddles. Perhaps Gertrude won't turn up, after all. She had a fit of the sulks this morning.\" \" Isn't that your carriage coming up the road ? * \" So it is. I'll get the saddles changed at once.1"], [36, "CHAPTER V. A Blank Day, HEN Gertrude arrived at the meet and discovered that her husband had ordered the saddles to be changed, she was violently angry, both with him and Captain Dashwood ; but as the latter had taken good care to keep out of her sight, poor Harry Stanford had to do his best to stem the torrent of her wrath, before introducing Lord Cosford to her. At first, she declared that nothing should induce her to ride Stella, and commanded Harry to tell Captain Dashwood to come to her. Then she seemed ready to cry with vexation like a spoilt child, and said that she would drive home again, which probably she would have done, if the appearance of Lord Cosford had not caused a diversion in her mind, and she rode off without saying another word to her husband, with Mrs. Delamaine and Mr. Langton. \" I tell you, Harry, plainly, that it will be rather rough luck on that mare of Dashwood's to-day,\" Sir Archibald said to his nephew as they were jogging along to their first draw. \"Gertrude may be angry with us all, but I am afraid the mare will receive most of the punishment.\" \"So I expect. I wish Gertie had not gone off with that cad Langton, I wish somebody would horsewhip the beast, I can't while he is my guest ; I've a good mind to ask Manisty to do it.\" \" H'm ! Manisty would do a good deal for you in the cause of friendship, but I expect he would draw the line at thrashing your 28"], [37, "A blank day. 29 guests for you. Personally, I detest Langton from the little I've seen of him. I think that he is one of those ill-bred, gambling hangers-on who bring racing into discredit. Now Dashwood is a very different man, though he belongs to the modern school of turfites. Well, here we are at Budge Gorse. If we find, I'll bet a monkey to a gooseberry, that Langton can't pilot Gertrude away. They have gone down a pudding-bag ride now.\" \"What do you mean ?\" \" Don't tell them my boy, but the bridge by which that ride used to cross the big drain in the centre of the gorse, fell in during the summer, and\" has not been repaired. If hounds find, they will be pounded; and, By Jove ! we have found.\" Sir Archibald was right. A faint whimper swelled into a resolute chorus, and the first whip had already viewed a stout old dog fox, who had no idea of being chopped in covert, and had already made for the open. As Sir Archibald and Harry rattled over the bridge, half-way down the ride, the former pointed out the debris of the other bridge, a quarter of a mile lower down. \" I'm glad I'm not in Langton's boots;\" was Harry's only rejoinder, for he acted upon the principle that there is a time for fox-hunting, as well as for other things. Perhaps he was rather pleased than otherwise, that his wife would be pounded. At all events, when he saw the opportunity of slipping away on the stern of hounds, he had no intention of turning back to pilot his wife. Cavaliership is an excellent institution at covert side, but when hounds are running, ladies must attend their lords and masters, and not expect to be attended to. The most uxorious husband will forget the very existence of his wife, when he hears the welcome cry \" Gone away.\" Yet to do him justice, if Harry Stanford had foreseen the chapter of accidents from which his wife was gaining her first experience of the Cosford hounds, he would have resigned his prospect of a good gallop, in order to come to her rescue. She and Langton, when the hounds gave tongue, splashed down the ride to the broken bridge, only to discover that they were pounded. They must either ford the place, or go at least a mile and a half"], [38, "Society Rogues. 30 round, and they wasted over five minutes in discussing which course they would pursue, till at last Langton, who, with all his faults, was a bold horseman, plunged in, and got out on the right side none the worse, except for being inconveniently moist. But Gertrude was not so fortunate. Although Captain Dashwood had not bought his mare out of a bathing machine, she had a strong partiality for water, and decided to lie down in the middle of the stream \u2014 or rather drain \u2014 which like most drains was muddy, and decidedly unsavoury. It was in vain that she made a liberal use of whip and spur. Fate, or the mare, had ordained that she should take a cold bath, and Langton had to dismount and drag her out on to the bank. To add to her misery, her hat and the skirt of her habit had come off, and gone floating down stream ; so, it was veritably a case of the last state of the woman being worse than the first, a result which generally happens when ladies trust themselves to strange pilots, whether in the hunting field or any other walk of life. As the knowledge that one looks like a drowned rat, is not conducive of good-temper, it is perhaps unnecessary to add that Langton's attempt at rescue was only rewarded with abuse ; while to add injury to insult, he was commanded to plunge again into the water to recover the skirt and hat. Having regained possession of these lost garments, a further difficulty arose. Gertrude's or rather Captain Dashwood's mare having enjoyed her roll, during which performance she seriously damaged the side-saddle, got out of the stream on the same side from which she went in, and apparently thinking that she had distinguished herself sufficiently for one day, shook her head at her late rider, turned round and with a whisk of her tail trotted off in the direction of Stanford Hall. The horse that Langton had been riding seeing this man\u0153uvre, jerked the reins out of Gertrude's hand who was holding him, and plunging into the stream joined his late companion. As the two horses, like certain criminals made in Germany, were unable to speak the English language and no equine interpreter was in the stables, it was never discovered how they arrived at Stanford Hall, though Captain Dashwood remarked"], [39, "A blank day. 31 in confidence to Manisty that his mare was cleverer than he had ever thought that she was. \" She wasn't such a fool as some people, my boy. She wasn't going to be punished by a woman.\" Manisty laughed, and asked ; \" Well ; what did you think of Splendacious ? Is he good enough to win a race ? \" \" I can't say ; but I think he is good enough to put into training. The horse can gallop and jump, but he has the very deuce of a temper.\" \" So I thought to-day. I saw you once in difficulties during the first run. I should imagine that you didn't have a very pleasant ride.\" The two men were chatting over a quiet cigar and something alcoholic in the smoking-room before dressing for dinner, and enjoying the pleasant feeling of laziness engendered by hard physical exercise. \" Well ; it is never very pleasant to ride a strange horse in a strange country ; but when the strange horse happens to be a raw young thoroughbred and the strange country is intersected by open drains, the wise man had better go home directly hounds have found. However, wisdom was never one of my strong points ; so I thought I would do my best to hold my own with you fellows.\" \"And our fox took us over a nasty line of country,\" Manisty interposed. \" But he gave you a good run from all accounts,\" Dashwood answered, as he settled himself more comfortably in his easy chair. \" I was not in the first flight or anywhere near it, worse luck.\" \" I saw you on your back once.\" \" Lucky for me that you did not see me on my back for ever.\" \" Well, tell me about Splendacious.\" \" Oh, certainly, if you like to hear me spin a yarn. You ink spluttering Johnnies always make out that you saw the fox break covert and were on the stern of hounds till they ran into the varmint. No offence to you, Manisty, but you writing fellows always will puff yourselves up. I suppose it is a trick of the"], [40, "Society Rogues. 32 trade, for I never saw one of your fraternity in the same field with hounds in my life.\" \" Nobody can deny that your expressions are more classical than Johnsonian.\" \" Oh ! Confound Doctor Johnson and The Cheshire Cheese. I really do believe, Manisty, that you have gained all your Johnsonian knowledge from that good-natured Fleet Street landlord, Charlie Moore, who gives you unlimited credit for beef-steak pudding on condition that you invent some new corner in his house where Johnson or Goldsmith or some other literary man got drunk and went to sleep. Don't look angry ! We've got another quarter of an hour before going up to dress. My experience of to-day ought to provide you with fresh copy. Confound it all, man, we are not always in the first flight though we say that we are. Ananias is a chicken compared to the average hunting man.\" \" Then, open your lungs like a nigger minstrel on Margate Sands. I've no doubt that the editor of the ' Whi techapel Rat Catcher ' will accept the report.\" \" Well, when hounds were put into that beastly covert, which you call Budge Gorse, but which might just as aptly be called Budge Forest, I guessed that the best thing I could do, was to stick to Harry Stanford, but what I proposed, Splendacious dis- posed ; and no sooner had hounds found, than he gave me a specimen of his temper, by trying to get hold of his head, which he nearly succeeded in doing, and when we had finished our first little battle, Stanford was out of sight. There was nothing for it, but to join the ruck, and we all went splashing down the deepest, muddiest, ride I was ever in, with the dirt flying all about, enough to blind one, and Splendacious tearing at the bridle as if he were mad, which perhaps he was. I was precious glad when I saw the gateway leading into the open, and was congratulating myself that I should be able to take it out of my gee, when some thrusting scoundrel knocked me into the gate-post. I can feel the bruise on my knee now. It was a bit of luck that he didn't break my leg. Those fellows ought not to be allowed out.\""], [41, "A blank day. 33 \" They are a nuisance at the beginning of a run. Fortunately, we don't see much of them later in the day.\" \" That's one comtort. However, Splendacious took advantage of my pain to do a bolt. It isn't pleasant to be bolted with at any time, but to be bolted with over a rough common is as near purgatory as they make it. The marvel is, that the brute didn't put his foot in a rabbit-hole and break his leg. What hounds were doing, I hadn't the faintest conception, except that I saw there was no chance of my riding over them.\" \" They were going racing pace. There was a rare scent.\" \" Stuff and nonsense. No hounds yet ever went racing pace. That is one of the stock phrases of the hunting reporter. How could horses live with them for a couple of miles, if they did ? How could ninety-nine out of a hundred hunting men ride ? You are a good man to hounds, but my dear fellow, I doubt if you could ride two miles at racing pace. See how our amateur riders have to train ? But this is not to the point, except that I only went racing pace for about a couple of furlongs, with the odds at ten to one that I came to eternal grief every stride, till we came to what I suppose you would dignify by the name of brook or dyke, I should call it a man-trapping drain. Such things ought never to be constructed in a hunting country. However, I saw some other fellows have it, so determined to do or die. Besides, I couldn't have stopped Splendacious even if I had wanted to shirk it. My chief fear was, that the beast would gallop straight into it, and terminate his own career and mine as well on this wicked world. I knew he couldn't refuse, I did my best to steady him, and we got over all right ; that was one comfort, but we didn't land all right. What happened, I can't for the life of me tell you, for I shot into a furze bush. That must have been the time you saw me on my back.\" \" Yes,\" Manisty replied, \" It was a very comical sight.\" \" I dare say it was. We picked ourselves up, and I thought that his fall might have cured Splendacious of some of his superfluous ardour. He went all right till we had crossed that .beastly common and got into the country again, and I congratulated c"], [42, "Society Rogues. 34 myself that we were on amicable terms together though I didn't ses much chance of our being able to catch hounds. Still I thought I should have an opportunity of testing the jumping powers of Splendacious ; nor was I disappointed. Our first fence was a stiff stake-and-bound, just the sort of place to make a horse turn turtle, if he tried to brush it. Splendacious rose at it, as if it had b;en a house, and nearly shot me clean out of the saddle. Then we had four or five large grass fields sloping up towards a windmill with nothing very formidable in the way of fences, and I was beginning to really enjoy my ride, albeit I did not know whether there were any hounds in front of me or no;. But I was counting my chickens before they were hatched. A yokel at the windmill directed me which way hounds had gone, which as far as I could make out was that they were running hard towards Swinerton Wood, about five miles off, so away I went for Swinerton Wood, down a deep, rutty lane, a very pretty lane in spring or summer, I've no doubt, but hardly an ideal exercise ground for young thoroughbreds. I don't mind coming a legi timate cropper across country, but it is ignominious to break one's neck on the hard high road, so I pulled Splendacious into a trot. That lane seemed interminable, and when I did get to the end of it there was not a soul in sight, and of course I hadn't the faintest idea where Swinerton Wood was. I listened but hounds might have been in the next county for all I could hear. This was a nice predicament for I didn't even know my way back to Stanford Hall. However, there was nothing for it, but to keep jogging along and to trust to luck, with eyes and ears alive to the slightest sign of hounds, though I guessed I shouldn't see them any more to-day. To add insult to injury I met a parson, who asked me what sport I had had, so I explained the situation to him.\" \" ' How very unfortunate,' he remarked. \"'Very,' I replied. \" 'Isn't it ? I am Vicar of Swinerton, and if I'd only known hounds would be at Swinerton Wood to-day, I should have walked up there,'\""], [43, "A blank day. 35 \"It was the Reverend Bartholemew Bottlemug,\" Manisty interrupted, \" He is one of the characters of the county.\" \" So he informed me, for I accepted his invitation to gruel Splendacious at the Vicarage, and partake of some refreshment myself, after which I trotted quietly home.\" \" And kept out of the way of our hostess ? \" \" Rather ; though I do consider that she owes me a debt of gratitude, for she must have had a serious cropper if she had ridden Splendacious as I told Stanford, to say nothing of my having lost a good run. I hope she won't make a scene at dinner. AVell, it's time to go up to dress now, I trust I shall be at Stanford's end of the table.\" C 2"], [44, "CHAPTER VI. John Castor, HETHER under different circumstances, Gertrude would have created a scene, is a matter which we are not called upon to discuss, as an unexpected event had happened. John Castor had sent a tele- gram to say that he should arrive in time for dinner, and had arrived accordingly. His appearance in the drawing-room was a surprise to the guests. The Langton-cum-Delamaine element was deeply annoyed, for Gertrude had never dared to introduce this set to her father. Sir Archibald, Manisty, and Dashwood, were equally pleased. Gertrude was annoyed, and Harry Stanford was pleased. To use hyperbolical language, John Castor had dropped like a thunderbolt into a house divided against itself. But both factions were agreed in one thing ; they were afraid of John Castor, with the exception of Manisty, who might be regarded as an independent critic. Nature, and the events of his life, had cast John Castor's features in a stern mould. The lower part of the face, which was entirely clean-shaven, was square and massive, denoting an unflinching fixity of purpose. Age had not dimmed the keenness of his eyes. The forehead was lofty, relieving the lower features by its intellectuality from any reproach of coarseness. The neck was firmly set upon broad shoulders, and added to the appearance of strength, which was the chief characteristic of the man. In stature he was slightly under six feet. Altogether he was a man of commanding presence. Though somewhat apt to be dictatorial in conversation, a Lord Chesterfield could not hive found any 36"], [45, "John Castor. 37 fault with his manners in ordinary society, and, if he were purse proud, and an upstart, he took care that his associates should not see it. Such was the man whom the guests at Stanford Hall found in the drawing-room talking to Sir Archibald. Manisty and Dashwood were the only two male guests in the room whom he knew, and Langton was the only man whom Gertrude introduced to him, which she did in rather a gushing manner, styling him her champion of the morning ; but as Mr. Castor had already heard of his daughter's adventure from Sir Archibald, the champion was only rewarded with the coldest of bows, and a sharp glance which seemed to say \" I can read through you, my good fellow,\" while Dashwood who was standing by, said : \" It was a case of the blind leading the blind, and both falling into the ditch, eh, Langton ? \" Gertrude gave Dashwood a look which was intended to annihilate him, but it had no effect on the captain, who continued nonchalantly, without waiting for Langton to reply. \" You will have a look at the Cosford hounds now you are here, Mr. Castor?\" \"Yes, if Sir Archibald or Harry can find me a quiet mount and a safe pilot, for I am not so light as I used to be.\" \" You are sure to be on the safe side if you take Sir Archibald's advice,\" Gertrude said with asperity. \" Then I shall take it,\" Mr. Castor replied quietly. But John Castor, albeit he was a keen sportsman and a good man to hounds for his age, had not come to Stanford Hall for the sole purpose of hunting, as Sir Archibald knew before Mr. Castor proposed to him that they should have a quite chat together instead of joining the younger men in the smoking-room before retiring for the night. Sir Archibald assented, though he did not relish the proposition. \" And how does our matrimonial plan work, Sir Archibald ? \" \" If you mean in regard to affection, not at all. Gertrude has a decided temper and does her best to snub Harry. She lets him know that she holds the purse-strings.\""], [46, "38 Society Rogues. \" That is the worst of these alliances. Yet, she is only a woman ! \" \" But a very strong-minded one. She did her best to snub me.\" \" I hope she did not succeed. Harry must not let her have too much of her own way. Not that these matrimonial squabbles need concern us.\" \"Still they are very unpleasant. They create strained relations as you could see for yourself at dmner. You may think me foolish, but I am old-fashioned enough to take an interest in the happiness of young people.\" \" So am I, but a petty quarrel about a horse does not constitute unhappiness. All married people have these bickerings, I suppose. Let Harry and Gertie settle down and they will soon see that they are only a nuisance. But to come to our business. We must start operations at once. There is not a day to be lost. I have seen the draft of the Bill which will be laid before the House at the beginning of the year. We must begin sinking our first shaft before Christmas.\" \"Suppose after all, we have been mistaken.\" \" Then I shall drop close on half a million,\" Castor replied quietly. \" For this property as it stands is of no use to me.\" \" I haven't spoken a word to Harry yet about the matter.\" \" There was no reason why you should. Indeed : he wouldn't have understood it if you had, and not improbably, would have told the scheme to those who would know how to take advantage of the rjews. I think it is agreed that we tell him no more than is absolutely necessary.\" \" That was the agreement,\" Sir Archibald said with a sigh. \" But I don't like to deceive the boy.\" \" Nonsense ! Leave him to me ! Besides ; I fail to see that there is any deception. Consider the facts of the case. You and I enter into a certain business partnership, which will eventually benefit your nephew and my daughter. To consolidate our identity of interests, we arrange a marriage between the bene ficiaries ; but it is no more necessary to tell Harry the details of"], [47, "John Castor. 39 our business than to tell Gertrude. All that he need know is that we are working to improve the estate. He ought to be thankful to us for not worrying him with business which he cannot understand, and leaving him to enjoy his hunting and shooting and racing, though he had better leave the last alone.\" \" You don't wish him to give it up altogether, do you ? \" \" The old Adam, Sir Archibald, I see,\" Castor said, laughing. \" Let him have a few steeple-chasers in training to amuse himself with ; but don't let him think that he can make racing pay, because he can't.\" \"You know Captain Dashwood pretty well. Manisty half suggested to me that we should take his advice in racing matters.\" \" You might do worse, I should say, especially if Manisty tells you so ; for Manisty is a long-headed fellow. Personally, I know next to nothing about turf matters, but I believe that Dashwood is a cute man, and his honour is beyond suspicion. I have known him since he was a boy. He taught Gertie to ride, I know, or at all events to sit on a horse without tumbling off. However, that is a matter in which we can take Harry into our confidence. Can you ride over the estate with me, to-morrow, so that we can settle where we will commence working ? \" \" As you wish.\" \" Very well. I have brought down all the plans with me. If we look them over together now for five minutes, it will save us some time and trouble in the morning.\" The two men were soon busy poring over plans and other documents till the five minutes extended into two hours, and Sir Archibald, unaccustomed to deal with the details of business at any time, grew perplexed and tired. Castor, on the other hand, grew more clear-headed as the hour grew later. No detail was too trivial to escape his attention, and when at last he put together his papers, he seemed fresher than at the beginning of the evening. \" A good night's work, Sir Archibald, we have everything cut and dried on paper, so can commence the practical part of our work to-morrow, Good-night ! \" Sir Archibald was only too glad to be relieved. If he had been"], [48, "Society Rogues. 40 examined about the night's work, he would have been astounded at his own ignorance. John Castor went up to his bedroom, and stirring up the fire, sat down before it in the easiest chair in the room. \"I wish I could have done without Sir Archibald, but it was impossible unless I exposed my hand to the public,\" he said to himself, \" Besides his name will be a guarantee of honour in the eyes of the public I wonder what the shareholders of the Star Railway Company will say when the crisis arrives, and they find that they will have to purchase mining property instead of agricul tural land. The fluctuations in the stock should be unprecedented and I shall hold the key of the situation, using my good, honest, and honourable friend, Sir Archibald, as my nominee ; but it shall be my last speculation. Let me but bring this to a successful issue, and I will devote the rest of my life to political fame. I will win my peerage, and live to look down upon these peers by inherit ance ; I am not yet fifty, I might marry again and have a son.\" John Castor smiled to himself. It was not a pleasant smile, it was a traitorous smile, like the kiss of Judas, yet John Castor is not the only radical commoner whose ambition in life is to rise to the peerage, nor the only financier who does not hesitate to rig the market. Fortunately, such men are not always successful, but if John Castor had heard a heavy breathing behind the curtains of his bed, he would not have slept in such calm repose as he did sleep. So far, John Castor had been eminently successful. The keynotes of his success were energy, and an ability to master a multiplicity of details in widely different matters at the same time, qualities found in a minor degree, in all politicians who rise to eminence, but rarely seen in the same degree in which they were possessed by John Castor. Though he had not retired to bed till the small hours of the morning, he was out of doors long before the usual breakfast hour, inspecting the property which he intended to turn into a gold mine. As it happened he met Manisty, who, in the country at all events was always an early riser. \" Good morning, Manisty,\" he began with more cordiality in"], [49, "John Castor. 41 his voice, than he was accustomed to use. \" Enjoying the morn ing air like myself, I see. The best medicine in the world, isn't it ? I was very glad to find that you were one of my son-in-law's house party. Dashwood here too, I am glad to see. That reminds me that I want to have a few words with you.\" \" With the greatest pleasure in the world, Mr. Castor.\" John Castor put his arm confidentially through that of the younger man, as they turned to walk towards the house. \" From what Sir Archibald tells me, Harry has got a spice of the old Adam left in him, yet. He still retains his affection for the turf, eh ? \" \" It is an affection not easily eradicated.\" \" Of course not ; I know that. I only want Harry to keep in bounds, for I do not think that his knowledge is equal to his affection for racing. Sir Archibald hinted to me that it would be a good thing if Dashwood were to advise him.\" \" The question is. what do you mean by advice ? Do you mean that Dashwood should manage a small stud for him ? To advise a man about racing, and to manage his horses for him, are two very different things. Good advice, as you know, Mr. Castor, is the cheapest commodity in the market, and the man who follows it, is the rarest man in the world. Dashwood would be sure to insist upon having a free hand, if he had anything to do with Harry's horses. He is a good judge of chasers and hurdle-racers, and as I don't suspect that you look forward to Harry owning a Derby winner, Dashwood would be as good a man as I know, to manage for him, always providing that they can come to an arrangement. But I thought perhaps, that Mrs. Stanford would like to have a say in the matter.\" \" Ah ! \" Castor laughed. \" You think that my daughter wishes to drive the coach, eh ! That is all nonsense. I don't suppose that there was much love lost between her and Harry before they were married, but my experience is, that some of the happiest marriages have been those in which the love comes afterwards. Two strange partners disagree at first, in most partnerships, but they soon manage to work amicably together."], [50, "Society Rogues. 42 Will you sound Dashwood for me, on this racing business ? You can do it in a more delicate manner than I could.\" \" Certainly I will if you wish it.\" \" Thank you very much. Ah ! Here we are at the house. I see my daughter at the dining-room window, and I for one am ready for breakfast.\" Mr. Castor still retained hold of Manisty's arm. There is a story told of a young stockbroker, who asked one of the Rothschilds if he could put any business in his way. Rothschild said nothing, but took his arm and walked round the Exchange with him. That young man never looked back. Mr. Castor seldom did anything without a motive. Gertrude now knew that Manisty was a man whom it would be unwise for her to offend. After breakfast, Mr. Castor and Sir Archibald went out for thj ride which Mr. Castor had proposed on tha previous evening. We do not intend to weary our readers with the details of mining operations, so we will not ask them to accompany Mr. Castor aid Sir Archibald on thdr morning excursion. Besides. Mr. Castor would object to let them into his secrets. When a gentleman is mortgagee of agricultural property beneath the surface of which he knows coal to exist, and is an ex-director of a large railway company which has a Bill in Parliament giving it powers to purchase the property at a valuation price, it is wise for him to increase the value of the property by commencing to work for the coal. And as he may not wish his own name to appear, it is wise for him to use the nam_ of the mortgagor, having first bound the mortgagor to him by ties of blood as well as by ties of mutual interest. If he is sufficiently wealthy and sufficiently clever to manage the market of the railway stock, so much the better for his banking account. He will only bring loss, and may be, ruin, to a few hundreds of shareholders. But as England is supplied with excellent poor laws, this need not trouble his conscience. Fraud ! Dishonesty ! Nothing of the sort. It is only financial Machiavellism. Charity used to cover a multitude of sins ; but at the end of the nineteenth century, Charity is not in the running with a house in Park Lane and a million at the Bank."], [51, "43 CHAPTER VII. Gertrude turns Matchmaker. OMEN like Gertrude Stanford, seldom have friends of their own sex. Parasites, libels on the sacred name of friendship, they have in abundance, but the parasite vanisheb when the power of the patroness is on the decline. As soon as John Castor arrived at Stanford Hall, Laura Delamaine determined to leave it, she had occasionally met him at Park Lane, but in the busy routine of his London life he had barely noticed her ; here in a country house, matters were different, he would find her out the very moment that she aroused his curiosity. Even Gertrude's partiality for her was against her, for Gertrude's star was descending, so Laura Dela maine determined to beat a graceful retreat. She came down to breakfast one morning in a travelling dress, and explained that she had received news about a sick aunt which made it imperative that she should return to London. Of course everybody said they were sorry, and nobody believed her. She had a short tete a-tete with Gertrude before she left, for she thought that Gertrude's influence might return in London. \" I am so sorry to have to leave you, Gertie dear. Of course, the story of the sick aunt is twaddle ; but even with you, I could never stand this country life. I am only a poor town mouse.\" \" It is not very enlivening, but I am bound to put up with it."], [52, "Society Rogues. 44 I dare say I shall grow to like it, if we have a constant succession of guests. I enjoy the hunting, and don't mind following the guns or driving down with the luncheon. The dinner parties are not half so dull as those in London. It is preferable to talk sport than politics. Then Harry tells me as much about his racing as Captain Dashwood chooses that he should tell me, and the tenants interest me, and I like to visit my poor people. I think in time, Laura, I shall become a model squire's wife.\" To do Gertrude justice, her heart was far from unkind, and she had devoted more than one morning to visiting the neigh bouring cottages, though she had not chosen to tell Laura how she had spent her time. \" My dearest Gertie, what a difference a week can make in anybody, or is it parental influence ? \" \"My dearest Laura, I really can't tell you, but I should have thought it was a matter of indifference to you ; I suppose I must be easily acclimatised.\" \" Really, dear, I should never have thought it. But I see the carriage is at the door. Good-bye, love. I am so sorry to leave you and, so much connubial felicity, behind.\" \" Thanks, dear. Good-bye.\" Then the patroness and the parasite kissed each other. \" She never hinted at my coming to stay with her again. Never mind, my lady. I'll be even with you yet.\" Thus, Laura Delamaine to herself. \" Mercenary little wretch ! I'm glad I didn't lose my temper with her.\" Thus, Gertrude to herself. \"Now Gert,\" said Harry Stanford, who had joined his wife at the hall-door, to speed the parting guest. \" You will be punctual with the lunch, eh ? \" \" All right, old boy ! \" Mrs. Delamaine was right in one thing. The last few days had worked a great difference in Gertrude. Mr. Langton had left Stanford Hall two days after the arrival of John Castor. He saw that the men disliked him and that his hostess was no longer disposed to protect him ; two very cogent"], [53, "Gertrude turns matchmaker. 45 reasons why he should take his departure. But there was a third one, more cogent still. Not even free board and lodging with the best of hunting and shooting, were sufficient to satisfy Mr. Langton. Having no money of his own, he was bound to get money from other people. He had proposed to himself to take the place in which Captain Dashwood was now installed, thinking that Gertrude would give him her support, and little dreaming that Gertrude had long regarded Dashwood in the light of an elder brother or elder cousin. In any case he had thought to make something out of the Stanford racing establishment. But the palpable distrust in which he was held, both by Sir Archibald and Harry, made him see that that contingency was hopeless. On his first evening, he saw that the card-table was tabooed. There was no money to be made out of Stanford Hall by men of Mr. Langton's stamp. Therefore, Mr. Langton took his departure for other hunting grounds, whither we shall shortly have to follow him. At the present time we must ask our readers to remain with us at Stanford Hall. Gertrude was heartily glad to see the last of Mrs. Delamaine for more reasons than one. Like most young brides, she was a little bit of a matchmaker ; not a mischievous bit, but a pleasant bit ; and in her matronly capacity, she considered it to be her duty to see Captain Dashwood settled in life, as the term goes. But nobody knew better than she did, that the Captain was difficult to please. Women of the type of Mrs. Delamaine were his abomination, and as we have already stated, Gertrude had few, if any, friends. But she had many acquaintances. She knew many of the daughters of her father's political friends, amongst whom he numbered Cabinet Ministers; and one of these she had asked to stay at Stanford Hall. Edith Clavering, the eldest daughter of the Honourable William Robert Clavering, was one of those rare girls, who seem to possess every mental and physical accomplishment in moderation. This was the reason of her popularity with her own sex ; she never excited jealousy by a display of excellence. To a great extent, it was the reason of her popularity with men. She was clever"], [54, "Society Rogues. 46 enough to be companionable, or in other words to take an interest in the deeper problems of human life, without being a blue stocking or a \" new woman.\" She crjuld ride to hounds well enough to be able to take care of herself in the hunting field. She played golf and lawn tennis well, but regarded bicycling as the special recreation of the female inhabitants of transpontine suburbs. Her personal appearance was such as to defy minute description. One might stay in the same house with her for a month, and then only be able to describe her as a tall, graceful figure surmounted by a wreath of golden hair. The ever-changing expression of her face set at defiance a judgment upon her features, while, when she was in repose, she seemed to entrance the beholder with her own innate sympathy. A fashionable roue had spoken of her as \" the only woman with a soul whom he had ever met.\" We would term her beauty ethereal, if the pi. rase had not been applied to all the insipid blondes, who from the time of Raphael downwards, have done duty as Madonnas and posed as emblems of female coldness, rather than as emblems of female purity. We would rather term her the poetry of beauty ; a divinity, who calms our grosser passions, yet makes us bow the knee to Venus. Such was the woman, whom all-unconscious, Gertrude, all conscious, was designing in all good faith and purity of heart and mind, to throw, figuratively writing, into the all-unconscious heart of Captain Dashwood, with an energy which in the suture might be productive of superlative happiness or positive misery. To Edith Clavering, Dashwood was introduced in the drawing-room at Stanford Hall before dinner, by his hostess on the evening after Laura Delamaine's departure, with the usual intimation that it was his duty to escort her to the dining-room. Dashwood, careless, reckless Dashwood, went through the soup and fish with a fox-hunter's appetite, before it occurred to him that his companion was different to the thousand and one ladies whom it had been his lot to escort into dinner. The phrase is not egotistical, since being in the confidence of the fair sex, as especially confined to our sisters, our cousins and our aunts, who"], [55, "Gertrude turns matchmaker. 47 have a special habit of telling us of all male shortcomings, we have been informed on this creditable authority confined lo consanguinity unalloyed with the adulteration of affectionate partiality, that our female companions in country house symposia, are as glad to be rid of male conversational inanities during the early parts or acts of the symposium as the fox-hunting male element is glad to make acquaintance with the fleshpots of his hostess's kitchen, and the wine of his host's cellar. Dashwood, careless, reckless Dashwood, having negotiated the preliminary fences of soup and fish, drew his appetite together before going full speed at a bullfinch entree, and gave his thirst a conversational gallop. By the time the game arrived he was fit to come under the starter's orders ; yet, for reasons which he could not explain, he felt nervous in regard to Edith Clavering. She was so different to the ordinary run of girls whom it had been his fortune or ill-fortune to meet in Belgravian drawing-rooms; who talk about dancing, a subject which they do know ; and racing and hunting, subjects which they don't know ; since they are not taught in those schools whence the daughters of modern millionaires emanate in these days of African mines. So be it, Mr. Millionaire, hailing from South Africa or Klondyke ! We are sorry for the fact ; but it is a fact. First impressions go a long way, and Dashwood and Edith Clavering unconsciously created a good impression upon each other on the first evening that they met. They had both expected to meet the ordinary type of social butterfly, and both had been pleasantly surprised. Though his mode of life had made Dashwood lazy, he was a shrewd judge of human character and could be ironical without being malicious. \" Do you know Captain Dashwood, I never was more sur prised in my life than when I heard of Mrs. Stanford's marriage. I thought she was the last woman in the world to settle down to a country life.\" \" Are you quite sure that she has settled down ? \" .\" It seems so. I have not heard a word during dinner, except about hunting, shooting, and steeplechasing.\""], [56, "Society Rogues. 48 \" I am afraid I have been inexpressibly dull.\" \" Not in the least. I believe I have already caught fox-hunt- ing madness. Perhaps I was predisposed to catch it, but I certainly didn't expect Mrs. Stanford to become a martyr to it.\" \" I suppose, like most diseases, it is infectious, and we are all fox-hunting mad in this house, except myself.\" \" I thought you were the worst of any.\" \" Not a bit of it, I assure you. The steeplechasing is pre sumed to be my department, else I should not be here. You see, we males are only invited to country houses for purposes of utility, and my fancied utility is limited to the two to one, bar one, business. I'm a sort of amateur stud-groom, receiving board and lodging in lieu of wages, and am expected to work harder than my professional brother.\" \" Still I suppose you like it.\" \" I suppose so, or I shouldn't do it. I often think that man kind is divided into two classes, salaried servants and unsalaried servants, from an emperor down to a street scavenger. I know a worthy M.P. who has never spoken in the house in his life, yet rarely misses a debate however dull it may be ; when he dies, the newspaper readers will know that the Member for Mudbury is dead, and till he dies not one Englishman in ten thousand knows who the Member for Mudbury is. He is an unsalaried, unrecog nised servant of the country.\" \" Then you believe in the payment of Members.\" \" Good gracious, no ! I believe in having no Members at all. I beg your pardon, I forgot I was talking to the daughter of a Cabinet Minister; still the House of Commons is rather like the hunting field.\" \"How?\" \"A select few get into the first flight, and have all the fun of the sport to themselves, so long as they can keep their places, while the others gallop blindly after them.\" \" Why confine the analogy to the House of Commons? The hunting field is only a miniature representation of life. The chief question is, whether one will be in the first flight when hounds run into their fox.\""], [57, "Gertrude ttcrrti matchmaker. $ \" That depends upon the length of the run, the pace hounds' go, and the country which you are riding over. Besides, it would' never do for us all to hunt with the same pack ; I mean to have the same goal in view in this life.\" \" And what is your goal, Captain Dashwood ? \" \" I can't say. In the sentimental days of my youth, I had some faint ideas of becoming Commander-in-Chief, but the ideas were so faint, that they soon became obliterated altogether. I suppose my present ambition is to get as much enjoyment out of life as is compatible with doing the least possible harm to my neighbours.\" \" So the ambition does not even extend to winning races for Mr. Stanford?\" \" H'm ! That would be enjoyment, but I am sure it would cause harm to some of my neighbours.\" \" But if you were Commander-in-Chief, you would do harm to the enemies of the Queen ! \" \" I should try to, but it is doubtful whether I should succeed.\" The ladies left the dining-room, and Stanford immediately turned to Dashwood. \" Well ! What does Hendon say about Splendacious ? \" \" He thinks we may as well enter him for the Cosford Steeple chase Plate. Of course it is impossible to judge of his chance yet,\" Dashwood replied, and then muttered beneath his breath. \"Con found the idiot ! He would take the whole of the county into his confidence if I were to let him.\" \" Is he likely to meet anything dangerous ? \" \" There are sure to be two or three veteran stayers. You see it's three miles over a stiff course, and a valuable stake in addition to the entries. There will be a big field, I expect.\" \" Who will ride him ? \" Mr. Castor asked. The question led to some discussion. Dashwood proposed that Stanford should ride him, and Stanford wished Dashwood to ride him. \" Better settle it by the spin of a coin , heads Dashwood, tails Stanford. Is it agreed ? \" \" As you please,\" Dashwood answered languidly. D"], [58, "50 Society Rogues. The coin was spun, and came down heads. \" You're the lucky jockey, Dashwood.\" \" The luck is on the side of my heirs, I fancy. At all events, I don't expect the horse will give me a comfortable ride.\" Stanford regarded this seeming want of keenness as part of Dashwood's usual indifferent manner, either real or assumed. Whether real or assumed, Dashwood would have been at a loss to say himself. But to-night he felt more thriftless and careless than he had ever felt before. A few chance words from a girl whom he had met for the first time, had made him see how aimless his life had been. He asked himself whether he should drift on in this fashion till he broke his neck, or died in his bed. Yet what was he to do ? Before he could solve the conundrum he found himself addressed by Mr. Castor. \" I say that the buying of yearlings pays better than breeding them ; don't you agree with me, Dashwood ? \" \" I don't think either way pays ; certainly the plan of buying yearlings is a bad one. Baron Hirsch gave 31,350 guineas for twenty yearlings, and La Fleche was the only one that was worth his, or rather her, corn. The truth is, that high prices for yearlings of choice breeding, do not have the effect of making them race-horses. Baron Hirsch's case is not an exceptional one, for, in 1889, forty-one yearlings sold for 73,850 guineas, and won in stakes 34,126 sovereigns during their racing careers, and in 1890, fifty-eight yearlings fetched 99,730, and won 64,477 sovereigns in stakes. Sorry to trouble you with statistics, but the figures speak for themselves.\" \" Then how can racing be made to pay ? \" asked the millionaire. \"You must treat racing as a science, in the same way as you treat speculation as a science. The racing capitalist will not take the trouble to study the science, and the small man has not the requisite capital. It is only about once in fifty years that a Victor Wild is picked up for an old song. The truth is that the thing is overdone. Animals are overfed and unnaturally reared, and the ground on which they are reared is over-horsed and tainted.\""], [59, "Gertrude turns matchmaker. 51 And Dashwood leant back in his chair, wondering whether the reform of racing should be the aim of his life. Mr. Castor watched him narrowly, as if he had discovered something new in his character, a certain repressed energy, which he might call forth and use for his own ends. \" When do the Cosford Races take place ? \" \" About four weeks from now, so I shall have to get into training,\" Dashwood answered. \" I shall have to start to-morrow morning.\" It is curious how men who have earned a character for excessive laziness, who drawl through the world as if it were too much trouble to move their legs, and speak as if it were too much trouble to open their lips, exchange their torpor for superabundant energy, when the necessity for action arrives. Thus, Dashwood having resolved, or it having been resolved for him, to ride this race, immediately set to work to make himself as fit as self-denial could make him ; thus this evening he left the smoking-room earlier than usual, and retired to bed and his own thoughts, though not to sleep. Even the surroundings of his room kept him awake. It had received the name of \" Captain Dashwood's room,\" it being understood that the room was always to be in readiness for the Captain, so that he should be at liberty to come and go when ever he might choose ; it was the room relegated to the private and exclusive use of the Stanford Master of the Horse. \"Why am I here? What am I doing? What is the aim of my life ?\" D 2"], [60, "CHAPTER VIII.

It is with regret that we do so, for we would prefer to remain in the hunting field and the comfortable quarters of a country house, till the \"stinking violets\" interfered with the scent of our old friend, Sir Reynard. But fiction resembles real life in one thing, namely, that we all of us have to encounter unpleasant changes of scene.

As yet, however, we still retain possession of the wings of Pegasus ; so shall use them to fly from Stanford Hall to Mr. Langton's lodging in a dingy street, which we will call Mews Street, not two hundred yards from Piccadilly Circus. AVe have used the singular number, for Mr. Langton's town abode consisted of what the advertisement columns call a bed sitting-room, where he slept, smoked, performed his toilet, kept a bottle of whisky, and ate a frugal breakfast. Nobody ever visited him in this sanctum sanctorum of homes, for he belonged to a third-rate social sporting club of that order of institutions commonly though appropriately termed \" pot house \" clubs, where he could give a guest a chop and a cigar, and where evening dr.ess was not de rigeur after eight in the evening, except in the case of the waiters. Yet the room in Mews Street was Mr. Langton's home, and none the less dear to him because it was his only home. Here, he could rest after carrying out his schemes against society at large, and sporting society in particular ; here, he could devise new schemes ; here, owing to the confidence which existed between himself and the man and woman who kept the house, he was secure against the importunities of those candidates for"], [62, "Society Rogues. 54 Colney Hatch, who had given him credit. Indeed, very sew people knew of this private address, but amongst the few was Laura Delamaine. It was ten o'clock in the morning. A damp fog hung heavily over that quarter bounded on the north by Piccadilly, and on the south by Pall Mall, with AVaterloo Place and St. James's as its; eastern and western boundaries. The atmosphere was certainly not congenial to early rising. So at least, Mr. Langton thought as he lay in bed indolently sipping his tea, smoking cigarettes, and. perusing his correspondence. One letter seemed to cause him some anxiety, It was from Laura Delamaine. Mr. Langton. read it through three times, and then, as there was nobody within hearing, subsided into a soliloquy after the manner, though hardly after the morals, of the melancholy Dane. \" So Laura who does rae the honour to consider herself my confederate, has practically, been turned out of Stanford Hall, and has indulged in feline amenities with Gertrude. The first was inevitable, and the last foolish. I can do without Gertrude, but she can't. She says that I was turned out, which proves that she is not my confederate; and she tells me that Captain Dashwood is racing mentor to Harry Stanford, which I already knew. She is evidently thirsting for revenge, which is not at all surprising, as the thirst for revenge has always been a special attribute of the female sex. Unfortunately, it dwarfs the intellect and makes the mind wander from the main chance. She suggests vaguely, that we should conspire against Stanford's racing stable, omitting to mention any details of the conspiracy, and apparently forgetting that Stanford has not a horse in his stable worth conspiring against. I am not a novice in working a turf fraud, but I do not think I could hoodwink Hendon and Dashwood, even if there were anything to be made out of the game. Laura seems to think that people bet on a small steeple-chase like they bet on a big handicap, while I suppose it would be impossible to work an S.P. commission for a monkey. AVhat idiots women are !

AVhy did he throw out hints that he would start me as an outside broker in the City ? And why did he tell me in that deuced unpleasant stern manner of his, that the Stanford estates had nothing to do with me ? For the life of me, I can't give an answer. But one thing is evident ; John Castor is a good pay master. Now for Laura Delamaine.\" Then Mr. Langton, having completed his toilet, strolled out, looked at the sporting papers at his club, and made his way to Mrs. Delamaine's flat in Victoria Street, AVestminster, where we must follow him, since it is incumbent upon us to dig into the middle and lower strata of humanity. The lower strata are generally more prolific of interest than the middle. The stable boy is more honest and quite as entertaining as the Langtonian type of social thief. Yet if we were not aware of the existence of the Langtonian thieves, we might raise them on to a pedestal of respectability, receive them into our houses, make them members of the Jockey Club, and confer upon them that multiplicity of honours which we generally reserve for fraudulent churchwardens, bankrupt magistrates, and corruptible politicians. Mrs. Delamaine's flat was furnished on the Veneering principle,"], [64, "Society Rogues. 56 Everything was brand-new and smelt of varnish, while the varnish was the only genuine composition in the furniture. This might be easily accounted for by the fact that Mrs. Delamaine, constantly finding it convenient or necessary to change her abode, invariably bought her furniture on the hire system. Her residences during the last three years had ranged from a maisonette in Mayfair, to furnished apartments in Pimlico. Now, she was fairly well up in the stirrups, as Mr. Langton said to himself, as he touched the electric bell of her flat. \" You had my letter this morning, of course, or else you would not be here.

I must have two hundred and fifty before six o'clock, or else, my friend, I dissolve our friendship.\" \" If you were a man, Laura, I should call you a bully.\" \" But as I am only a woman, you would like to thrash me. I can see it in your face. You would strike me now, if you did not know that I always carry a revolver. Bah ! You men are but: idiots after all.

They would be far more interesting to you.\" Langton remained silent. He was a scoundrel, but he was not a first-rate scoundrel, for he was a coward.

The cool boldness of a Peace, compels admiration against our better feelings, but cowardice compels contempt.

Have I any influence on the Stock Exchange ? Could I sell my information to any man in the City, who would or could give me the price which it is worth ? You know that I couldn't, or I should not employ you. I speak freely to you, because we are friends, are we not, my dear Charles Langton ? Therefore my good friend, as the banks close at four, perhaps you had better go, as my two hundred and fifty pounds is due at six. Take a brandy and soda and a biscuit for lunch, bring the money, and then you can dine with me ; after dinner we will discuss business.\" Mr. Langton did as he was bid. He brought back two hundred and fifty pounds before six o'clock, he ate an excellent dinner, and fully compensated for the loss of his luncheon, and after dinner he discussed business with Laura Delamaine.

Perhaps he might define it a\u00a7 the legal robbery of one's neighbour."], [67, "CHAPTER IX, Langton Checkmated, HE Stanford Arms was one of those hostelries only to be found in small agricultural towns. In olden days, when inns were inns, we should have called it an inn. In modern days, we ought to call it an hotel. Let us say at once that it was a house of refreshment, where on market days the farmers met together, enjoyed an \" ordinary \" of the old-fashioned sort, and discussed the rise or fall of wheat and oats over whisky and water, where the \" gentry \" stabled their horses upon necessity, and tasted Jack Parkins's hot toddy, where hunting men gruelled their horses and gruelled themselves, and knew that their wives, sisters, cousins and aunts could get tea or other refreshments necessary to the feminine constitution after a long day in the pigskin, and where last, but far from least, racing men in search of information from Mr. Hendon's stables might gain accommodation, if they did not gain the information which they Shad come to seek. There was a sporting air about the Stanford Arms, which was \u25a0unmistakable. The black and white gables reminded one of the trees of a hunting saddle, and the latticed bedroom windows looked like the windows of a stable fitted up with loose boxes on the first floor. The bar had the appearance of a cosy saddle-rcom, with its walls covered with masks and brushes. The stable-yard had that appearance of business, which denotes clean straw and fresh gniel, old bay and seasoned oats. The stablemen looked 59"], [68, "60 Society Rogues. like workers, and not like tap-room loafers, for the stables were the special department of Jack Parkins and the pride of his life. The interior arrangements he left to his daughter, Miss Constance Parkins, who although she was barely twenty-two years of age, knew how to attend to the house and to the customers. Jack Parkins was a tenant of Sir Archibald's, and though he never alluded in public to his landlord's ill-fortune, and sternly reproved any of his customers who ventured to say a word against the baronet, yet old Jack was fully aware how the land lay. \"AVell, Connie, the old family has got a new lease of prosperity now. Master Harry's wife has got a mint of money.\" \" Perhaps she knows how to keep it, dad.\" \" AVell, I \u2014 I don't know about that, and I don't much care. But I do hear that she is fond of the horses.\" \" And a nice lot of screws they have got to be fond of ! \" \"That's their business, though I fancy now that this Captain Dashwood is going to manage the stable, things will be more prosperous ; and that fellow, who was in the bar last night fancies go too, or I'm much mistaken.\" It was Sunday afternoon, which the father and daughter usually spent in a quiet talk over the gossip of the week, which had considerably increased since Harry Stanford's return from his honeymoon. \" I have seen that man before, dad. There is a mystery about him.\" \" AVhat is it, my girl ? Not a tout, is he? \" \" Not a professional one, at any rate. He was staying at the Hall till within a few days ago, and strolled in here one afternoon; but he is not staying there now, because I asked Pearson, the Stanford coachman. He told me too, that he was not a friend of Mr. Harry's, but a friend of Mrs. Stanford's and that he thought he was up to no good.\" \" He struck me as being on ' the make haste.' AVe'll keep an eye on him and give Hendon a hint, if we see anything suspicious. Had he got anybody with him ? \" \" Yes, Mr. Tart, the new postmaster.\""], [69, "langto'/i checkmated. 61 '\" H'm !

I'll tell Hendon, when I see him. iN ot that I fancy there is much to be frightened about at present.\" \" They are going to put Splendacious into training.\" \" He ought to take some beating, for he is bred by Dromedary 'out of Rapid ; but all Dromedary's progeny have such fiendish tempers, though when they are in the humour they manage to give a good account of themselves. Did Pearson say anything to you about Mr. Harry's father-in-law ? \" Constance shook her head, and her father continued : \" It's a funny game ; a very funny game. I'm blest if I under stand it.\" \" AVhat game ? \" \" The game that is being played at Stanford Hall, to be sure. I was born in this house and I've lived here all my life, so I ought to know the class of customers who come here. AVe've had plenty of gentlemen and ladies too, staying here at times like the Cosford Hunt Ball, or for the races ; but we don't often get business men from London here, who transact their business at Stanford Hall. I don't think I'm more inquisitive than my neighbours, but I should like to know what it all means. Sir Archibald never did understand business and it's not likely that he will begin to understand it at his time of life ; while this John Castor is as deep a hand as they make them.\" \" He is enormously rich, isn't he? \" \" Yes. He has grown rich through the folly of men like Sir Archibald. Every square yard of Stanford belongs to him, more's the pity.\" Constance looked in astonishment at her father, who spoke with unusual vehemence, for he belonged to the old school of tenants who remain staunch in their loyalty to their landlords through all reverses. \"If that is so, why did Mr. Castor allow his daughter to marry Mr. Harry ? \" \" Ah ! That's the puzzle, unless he didn't get possession of the estates honestly, and is afraid of being found out. By Jove I It's past live, and here comes your mysterious stranger.\""], [70, "Society Rogues. 62 Charles Langton ehtered the hotel with the swaggering gait, which gentlemen, who are not quite sure of being considered gentlemen, often assume. It denotes a mixture of insolence and nervousness, which only renders the bearer pitiable. Jack Parkins saw through his customer at a glance. \" A cowardly blackguard,\" he muttered to himself, as he served him to the whisky which he ordered. \" I suppose I can have something for dinner, landlord, and I shall want a bed here for two or three nights. My luggage is at the station, if you will send for it.\" \" Certainly, sir. Beg pardon, sir, but I think I have seen you at Stanford before, when you were staying at the Hall.\" \" Very probably,\" was the laconic answer. \" AVould you like a private room, sir? \" \" No, the coffee-room will do for me. Besides, I am by myself, and too much of my own company makes me depressed. Let me have, well, anything that you can let me have, so long as I have it soon, for I have had nothing since the morning, and your country air makes me hungry.\" \" In case anybody calls for you, sir, what name shall I say ? * \" Langton \u2014 Charles Langton.\" As we have seen, Langton was in joint possession with Laura Delamaine of a valuable secret ; but like many people who possess valuable information, he did not quite know how to turn it to account, and, as he had already practically paid two hundred and fifty pounds for it, and had agreed to share the suture proceeds with Laura Delamaine, he was anxious to see a quick and large return for his secret. AVith anybody else but John Castor, Langton would have known how to deal ; but he felt that with John Castor, blackmailing tactics would be worse than useless. Yet money he wanted, and money Laura Delamaine said that she would have. The secret doubtless was worth many thousands of pounds, but how many men could afford to give him thousands of pounds, or how many men would believe that he possessed a secret worth thousands of pounds. Langton had thought long about - the matter, and discussed the matter with Laura Delamaine."], [71, "Langton checkmated. 63 Would John Castor pay them to be silent ? To answer that question it was imperative first to see John Castor. Therefore Langton came down to Stanford. \" And don't neglect the racing part of the business,\" were Laura's last words. \" If you can kill two birds with one stone, so much the better.\" From which it will be seen that Laura Delamaine and Charles Langton had entered into an alliance offensive and defensive, which, like international alliances, either party would break according to his or her convenience. Though Langton had left London on the Friday morning, for reasons which will be ex plained at the proper period, he did not make the Stanford Arms his headquarters till the Sunday evening, but he had written to Mr. Castor to ask him to meet him there on the Monday morning, merely stating that he had an important secret to disclose to him. As Mr. Castor constantly received similar communications, the letter did not cause him much surprise, and it was idle curiosity rather than the expectation of learning anything useful, which prompted him to keep the appointment at the Stanford Arms. Jack Parkins was surprised to see the millionaire ride into his stable-yard, and hastened to receive him. \" Is a Mr. Langton staying here?\" \" He slept here last night, sir ; but he was in the town, and in the hotel on Saturday.\" \" Anybody with him ?\" \" Not staying with him, sir. He brought Mr. Tart, the post master, in with him on Saturday.\" \" The postmaster, eh ? Well, take me to him.\" Langton was waiting for his visitor in a private sitting-room, and rose as he entered with an outstretched hand, of which Mr. Castor took no notice. \"You have something to tell me. My time is valuable. Could you not have said what you want to say in writing?\" \" Not very well, Mr. Castor, it is a long story.\" \" Then make it as short as you can.

Again he asked : \" Is that all ? \""], [73, "Langton checkmated. 65 Langton hesitated. \"Come! My time is valuable.

Remember that an adventurer and adventuress unless they are married, can never work together.\" \" AA'on't my word be sufficient without the document?\" \" No, it won't,\" Mr. Castor said, sharply. Langton made no further remonstrance, and took up his pen while Mr. Castor paced up and down the room, calculating how much it was worth to him to have Laura Delamaine in his power. AArhen Langton had finished, he rang the bell for Parkins to witness the signature, which the landlord did with a high sense of his own importance, and left the room again to relate the fact to his daughter. \" Good,\" said Mr. Castor, after he had read the document. \" Now give me a receipt for a hundred pounds.\" The receipt was given and Mr. Castor handed over the sum in notes, for he knew that cheque-books tell tales. \" I need hardly advise you for your own sake, to keep this transaction a secret.

The afternoon was as dismal as an early winter afternoon in London can be. The two gas-lamps which burnt above Manisty's head, looked like two disappointed moons, striving to shed their light on Manisty, who in his turn, looked like a swimmer battling against waves of paper.

A Lawn Meet. HOUGH Lord Cosford, like the majority of modern masters of hounds, had a rooted antipathy to hunt breakfasts and lawn meets, holding the orthodox belief that people came out to hunt, and not to eat, drink, and chatter county gossip, yet he made an exception in favour of Sir Archibald, at the same time stipulating that under no consideration, would he give more than a quarter of an hour's law. Sir Archibald would willingly have sacrificed his own old- fashioned prejudice in this respect, and indeed had abolished the formal meal in which our ancestors were wont to indulge before swinging themselves into the pigskin. The modern hunting man, if he takes anything, contents himself with a liqueur, and a biscuit ; but the farmer, who has breakfasted at seven and been over his farm before donning his hunting breeches, is ready for more substantial fare in the shape of cold meat and champagne ; and hospitality towards the farmers who supply us with sport, is a paramount duty. Both Sir Archibald and Harry did their best to see that every farmer who turned up at the meet, was asked into the old dining-room. Servants with trays bearing sandwiches and decanters, wandered about out of doors to the no small risk of being kicked to death. A small army of stable-helpers, labourers from the home farm, et hoc omne genus, found employment and loose change in holding horses. Carriages rolled up in scores, in many cases carrying people chiefly of the fair sex, to whom the meet at Stanford Hall, was the only day of the season on which they saw hounds. Foot-people 7J"], [82, "Society Rogues. 74 padded the hoof from every place within reasonable distance. There, too, was the Reverend Bartholomew Bottlemug, vicar of Swineton, mounted in workmanlike breeches on a stout cob, indifferent to the fact that his Archdeacon was present in a low pony phaeton. A Quorn field of__i numbers three or four hundred sportsmen and sports-women determined to ride; but it is doubtful whether even Lord Lonsdale ever had such a difficult field to manage as the one which gathered annually at the lawn meet at Stanford Hall. Lord Cosford might have done well to quote the warning of \"Black\" White, erstwhile Master of the Cheshire, to his followers before drawing for his first fox : - \" Draw near. I've just a word, a warning word, to whisper in your ear. When starting from Ihe covert s'd,:, ye see bowd Reynard bust, Ye can have no hunting, if the gemmen go fust.\" But the allotted time for coffee-housing is over, and in accordance with an old custom, hounds move off to draw the home coverts, which needless to say, are invariably drawn blank. The ladies on wheels are disappointed, forgetting that Master Reynard is a cunning beast, and is determined that his brush shall not be the answ-er to the question, \" what came ye out for to see ? \" He had slunk off quietly while you, my dear ladies, were discussing the last engagement, or pretending not to like cherry brandy, muttering to himself \" this is no place for m _\u2022.\" Still the farce is duly acted like a curtain raiser at a theatre. The old actors know that it is only prefatory to the real business, and settle themselves in their saddles like playgoers settle themselves in their seats. Those who have come out to be admired, have been admired, or otherwise, like ladies' hats at a matinee. The horse-dealer has told his stock lies about his mount, to the probable and verdant purchaser. The Squire has listened to his tenant farmer's request about the new barn; the renewal of leases, the reduction of rents, the hunt ball, and the hunt steeplechases, all have their special conversational clients. \" Now do point out Major Dashwood to me.

The first whip, sitting at the corner of the spinney, mute as the Duke of AA'ellington on Constitution Hill, with one eye on covert, and the other on the surrounding country, suddenly raises his cap, the huntsman sees him, but makes no response.

This isn't the charge of Balaclava.\" (The latter remark from the Reverend Bartholomew Bottlemug to his churchwarden, whom he does not recognise in his excitement.) Yet we doubt if even the heroes of the Light Brigade dashed forward with the ardour with which a first flight man rides to secure a good place at the start. Still, it is gently, quietly does"], [84, "76 Society Rogues. the trick. See that blustering man, bumping about his saddle for all the world like a sack of potatoes ! He is nick-named the \" Colonel of the Swaggering Brigade.\" He goes across the first field all arms, legs and voice, but the bull-finch pulls him up and he turns off for a gate, so we see him no more. Not so the Reverend Bartholomew, who, stimulated by Stanford cognac, sends his cob at it in the wake of Major Dashwood. The cob, like his master, does his best, but alas! though the spirit is willing, the condition is weak, and both tumble back into the ditch. That bull-finch proves a stop-gap to many; and the hustling at the only gate tries the tempers of the quietest-mannered horses, while the inability of the first man there to lift the latch, tries the tempers of the riders. AVhen at last he has lifted it, the gate opens towards him, and his former traducers crowd past him, leaving him to meditate over the dictum that the first shall be last. In the meantime, the first flight have got their work cut out to live with hounds. Lord Cosford has got well away with his hounds. He flatters himself that he knows every yard of every fence in the country and would be a good one to follow at a safe distance, for his lordship objects to fulfilling the office of pilot, and woe betide the man who dares to ride in his pocket. Rather let us watch Dashwood, who is a stranger in the country, yet directly he has jumped into a field instinctively knows where he is going to jump out of it. Still, don't follow him if you are timid ; for like the famous Mr. Assheton Smith, he boasts that he can get over any place with a fall. That hard funker has been trying to, but he is pounded now as he sees his pilot put his little thoroughbred, hardly more than fifteen hands, at a double post and rails on the top of a high, broad bank. \"No horse can do it,\" mutters the funker as he pulls up half frightened, to see what the result will be. On to the bank, in and out the rails and off the other side. \"He must be riding a gigantic cat\" mutters the funker as he turns aside. Yes, my friend; a cat in Dashwood's hands but a clumsy cow in yours, which are only fit to wash clothes with in the scullery of a suburban villa. Think well on it I This is no place for you, \" With Ihe cream of the cream, in the shire of shires.\""], [85, "A lawn meet. 77 The field has now been well spread-eagled, and it is easy to distinguish those who are seeing the sport, from the herd who are galloping after the leading men with the hope that a timely check may enable them to see hounds again. It is only some eight or nine minutes since the fox broke covert, yet out of the odd hundred and fifty who assembled at covert side, how many now, are within sight of hounds ? Fifteen or twenty at the most. Lord Cosford, the huntsman and second whip, are well at the stern of hounds, but the first whip has been left behind endeavouring to get his horse out of a ditch. Major Dashwood, some sixty or seventy yards to the left of hounds, and a good eighty behind them, still holds his own, though he tries to save his game little thoroughbred as much as is compatible with keeping his place. Two farmers riding to sell, and a horse-dealer's daughter doing ditto, are going well to the right of hounds, the latter, the only habit whose wearer can lay claim to being well up. She is riding all she knows, and has already put an extra fifty guineas on her mount, for she is aware that close behind her are four of the regular \" nailers to hounds young men \" of the hunt, to whose purses an extra pony or two is of little consequence so long as they get the article which they require. There too, is our old friend Captain Tipster ; the finest gentleman rider in England, or in all Europe for that matter, and close to him though not riding in his pocket, is another old friend, the Honourable Jim Gaddleton, who has trained across country from Lark for a day with Lord Cosford's beauties.* But the last-named comes to grief at the next fence, for farmers in the Cosford country have a knack of using stiff top-binders, which either the Honourable Jim or his horse, or both, are unprepared for. The horse strikes the binder with hardly more than his toes, but it is sufficient to make him turn turtle. His rider falls clear, but philosophically remarks as he picks himself up ; \" might as well have broken my neck for all I shall see of the fun, now.\" But Tipster's course is run, for they are approaching the Swineton \u2022 These names will be familiar to readers of \" Beaten at the Finish.\""], [86, "78 Society Rogues. Brook, as famous in the Cosford country as the AVhissendine or the Hillmorton Brook, since it is never contented unless silled to the brim. Even Lord Cosford wished that the Reverend Bartholomew Bottlemugwas up, for his Reverence from fishing the stream for trout throughout the summer, knows every treacherous place where the banks overhang and every place shallow enough to constitute a ford. Still, there is no help for it, for hounds are already racing on the far side. His lordship gels over all right, but sends some five or six yards of the bank into the stream on landing. Dashwood trusts blindly to providence, and providence gives him a firm take-off, and firm landing, which the thoroughbred took advantage of. Tom, the huntsman, wary old soul, knows that his horse is far too spent to fly the water, so picks out a spot which seems easy landing, and slips in and out like a professional diver. The horse-dealer's daughter gives a glance behind to sec who is watching her, and finding the four \"nailers to hounds young men\" still hanging on her skirts, goes at it as in duty bound, and landing safely mentally puts another pony on the price of her mount. Three of the nailers get in, of whom only one gets out on the right side ; and the horse of nailer number four refuses to have it at any price. Tipster lakes off from a rotten bank and finds himself underneath his horse in mid-stream. \" I don't know what happened next,\" he said afterwards ; \" for I was too busy saving myself from drowning, to think of anything else.\" Good old Swineton brook ! You have had a bumper, this time. So thinks the Reverend Bartholomew Bottlemug, who having been pounded at the first fence, has made a guess at the line which the fox would take, a guess probably prompted by the fact that the line would take him homewards. So he has bustled his sturdy cob along, 'ammer, 'ammer, 'am mer on the 'ard 'igh road. or floppity, floppity, down deep sandy lanes, with eyes and cars wide-awake for the least sign or sound of hounds, but it was not till he had nearly arsived at Swineton village, that his vigilance was rewarded. \"I thought so; he is making for Bangton Big AVood, and they'll have the Swineton Brook, plenty of water and no whisky, please. Come along old boy \" (this to the cob), \"we'll"], [87, "A lawn meet. 79 be with them yet.\" So his Reverence hustled along over a bridge not half-a-mile from where hounds crossed the brook, and, turning sharp into the open, was soon galloping in the first flight, much to the amazement of the very few who had ridden the line. Everybody who has ridden the line of a run from find to finish, can understand the feeling of provocation which even the most forgiving Christian has, when he sees a man who hasn't ridden straight across two fields, dodge in just as hounds are running from scent to view. The provocation is further increased by the fact that the dodger's horse is comparatively fresh, while those of the hard riders are done to a turn. So it was with the Reverend Bartholomew- Bottlemug. His cob was slow, but sturdy, and as he joined the remnant of the first flight as hounds were running into their fox, he laid his short legs to the ground with right good will, and as the last fence was well within his capabilities, he landed into the last field in front of Dashwood, and only a couple of lengths behind Lord Cosford. \" Halloa ! How did you come here ? Dropped from the clouds ? \" Dashwood asked, with some little irritation. \" I followed the hounds, Major, on my cob.\" Mr. Bottlemug replied, as he dismounted with the air of a man who was accustomed to show the way to the hardest riders of the Quom over Leicestershire. The final obsequies were quickly celebrated, for hounds had earned their blood, if ever hounds did earn it. As the horse dealer's daughter was the only lady up, Lord Cosford gave her the brush, and she was soon talking busily with the nailers to hounds. \" AVhat time did you make it, my lord ? \" asked a fussy little man, who was suspected of doing the hunting reports for the local paper. '\u25a0 Any time you like, sir. Those who rode the line were too busy to know, and those who didn't, don't care.\" Then he turned to Sir Archibald. \" Only just past two. Shall we draw Bangton Big AA'ood ? \" But those who had not second horses out, or whose second"], [88, "80 Society Rogues. horsemen had not turned up, were reluctantly obliged to turn homewards, congratulating each other on the gallop they had had, which had been hard and long enough to tire out the most willing horses of the most inveterate funkers ; and, for fear lest we too, should weary our readers, we will follow their example, and also turn homewards, that is, to Stanford Hall."], [89, "CHAPTER XII. Refused. AJOR DASHWOOD was not one of the few who went on to Bangton Big AA'ood, but went home with Mrs. Stanford, Edith Clavering, and Mr. Castor. AVhether Mr. Castor wished to speak privately to his daughter, or whether Gertrude, with the mischief of a match maker, pretended to wish to speak to her father, is of little consequence. The fact remains that the Major and Edith were left to a tete a tete for which the Major at all events, felt deeply grateful, though ic must be added that for a man of his social experience, he also felt strangely uncomfortable. Edith, on the other hand, whatever she might feel, appeared to be perfectly at ease. But then it is the special prerogative of the female sex to be able to conceal their feelings. At first their talk was confined to the incidents of the run, but by imperceptible degrees it grew more personal. \" And now that you have finally relinquished the army,\" Edith said, when he had told her how he had settled matters at the AVar Office, \" what do you intend to do ? Are you going to settle down at Stanford ? \" \" And be a gentleman pensioner at Stanford Hall? \" \" Come, Major Dashwood, you know I did not mean that ; so you ought not to have misinterpreted my question, though perhaps it was an impertinent one for me to ask.\" Si f"], [90, "82 Society Rogues. \" Impertinent !

But I don't want to worry you with my family history.\" \" AVhich you don't seem to know very much about, as far as your brother's family is concerned,\" she replied, laughing. \" No ; with the inquisitiveness of a woman I asked what you intended to do, and with the superior cunning of a man, you evaded the question. Yet I have always read in novels that men love to talk about themselves.\" \"So they do, for the reason that they can never resist an appeal to their vanity. Candidly, I don't know what I intend to do.

Besides, I have no reason for climbing the rugged Alps. I prefer the domestic hearth.\" \" Then why do you not go in for domesticity ? \" Edith repented the question as soon as she had asked it, for Dashwood replied suddenly. \" You forget that domesticity is a partnership of two. I have to find my partner in the first place. Perhaps I have found her. That is not difficult. But I have to gain her consent. That, I am afraid, would be difficult.\" There was no mistaking the emphasis which Dashwood placed"], [91, "Refused. 83 on the last Words. Edith affected to laugh, as she answered ; but it was a nervous laugh. \" That, I am afraid, is a difficulty in which I can't help you.\" Dashwood bit his lip, and was silent for some moments. He was too well versed in the ways of women, not to know that Edith's answer, rightly interpreted, meant. \" Don't propose, for I shall refuse you.\" And yet Edith had affected to take an interest in him. He had left the army, with the hope of settling down with her for his wife. Now it appeared that the interest, if any there was, was merely platonic. At last, he asked abruptly : \" Miss Clavering, is it possible that you ever can help me to solve this difficulty ? \" She turned her head and looked him steadily in the face. \" Major Dashwood, if you mean what I think that you mean, I must answer ' no.' Let us forget this conversation for both our sakes.\" \" Your will is law tome.\" He bowed low in the saddle as he spoke, with the air of a soldier receiving his general's commands ; but the blood rushed to his heart, and strong man as he was, it was only with a great effort that he prevented him self from swooning. But it was only for an instant. He had been brought up in a school, of which the first tenet was that its disciples must be undemonstrative. Before they had ridden another mile he was apparently the same listless, thriftless Dashwood as ever. However, Harry Stanford was surprised when Dashwood said to him in the smoking-room, before the dressing-gong rang ; \"Stanford, I am afraid I must leave to-morrow.\" \" Leave here, my dear fellow ! AVhat on earth for ? \" \" Only to train a little more severely. It is only a week now till the Cosford Races, and I am not as fit as I ought to be. Mrs. Stanford is good enough to release me from the ordinary social obligations, but it is beyond my moral courage to resist all the good things which come in my way. Besides, I have set my heart on winning this race, and mean to bring Splendacious and myself to the post as fit as training can make us.\" F 2"], [92, "84 Society Roguei. \" But, Dashwood, you make me ashamed of myself. I would never have asked you to ride the brute, if I had thought that you were going to make a martyr of yourself.\" \" Nonsense, man ! I should make a martyr of myself, and break my neck into the bargain, if I rode the horse without training. I shall not go to the North Pole. I only mean to take a room at the Stanford Arms, so as to be master of my own time and be able to be at Hendon's whenever he wants me, and to stick rigidly to a fixed diet. You'll see me up at the stables, and in this room often enough.\" Harry Stanford, not being entirely in his wife's confidence was surprised when he imparted to her the news of Dashwood's decision, to hear her exclaim \" then he has been refused ! \" \" AVhat the deuce do you mean, Gert ? \" \" That I've been a foolish, mischievous woman. Poor Tom ! My poor old playfellow ! I thought to make you happy, and I've made you wretched.\" \" AA'hat's the matter now, old lady ? I'm out of this scene.\" \" AA'hy, I asked Edith Clavering here, because I thought she would just suit Tom, and Tom would just suit her. AA'ell ! Can't you see ? She suits Tom, but Tom don't suit her. He proposed to her this afternoon on the way home from hunting, and she has refused him. I thought something was wrong when we came in ; for Edith went straight to her room, and Tom called for brandy and-soda.\" \" H'm ! AA'ell ! It can't be helped now. Hang it all, though, I wish it hadn't happened. I believe if Dashwood hadn't been in love he would not have chucked the service. Least said, soonest mended. He's too much of a man not to pull round. Don't let out, Gert, that you know the real state of affairs ! \" \"Of course I shan't. But oh, I wish it had never happened!\" And Gertrude shed genuine tears of sorrow, such as might prove a warning to the busybodies who delight in putting spokes in the wheels of love. The dinner at Stanford Hall that evening could not be pronounced an unqualified success, to use the language of AArest-"], [93, "Refused. 85 end hostesses, who during the season have created the mistake of getting the wrong people to meet the wrong people. Even Mr. Castor seemed ill at ease ; for he had given his daughter certain instructions, the epitome of which was that she should advise her husband to keep his temper, which instructions, Gertrude, in her anxiety about Dashwood and Edith, had entirely forgotten, though she had hardly understood them in the first place. For, here let it be said, that John Castor had never taken his daughter into his confidence in regard to his designs upon the Stanford estates. Perhaps it would have been far better for him if he had made a confidante of his daughter. John Castor was doubtless a gigantic kite, but like most gigantic kites he had a long and heavy tail. The gigantic kite with the long tail is a pretty sight so long as it sails merrily in the horizon, but an ignominious sight when it comes to earth, a tattered ruin to be gazed at and jeered at by the rabble who worshipped it but an hour ago. On the following morning, Major Dashwood went into training quarters at the Stanford Arms."], [94, "CHAPTER XIII. Cosford Steeplechases. T WAS the day of the Cosford Hunt Steeplechases, and even the London morning daily sporting papers devoted a column and a half, to what in sporting circles was considered one of the most genuine events of the cross country season. Time had been, when the Cosford Steeplechase Plate had commanded no small amount of ante-post betting, and sportsmen had the quotations served up to them, with their coffee and rolls. The inauguration of the big metropolitan fixtures had deprived the old hunt meeting of much of its importance. Still, it was always largely patronised, for on more than one occasion the big race had furnished the winner of the Grand National. The present year was no exception to the rule. Rumours were afloat that the Stanford stable had been largely increased owing to Harry Stanford marrying an heiress, and one paper hinted that a new millionaire, in the shape of Mr. Castor, had joined the ranks of the patrons of the turf. Thus the day was something more than an annual farmers' picnic such as constitutes the majority of Hunt meetings, though the farmers were strongly in evidence and ready to back their fancy, especially if the fancy happened to be a local horse. Therefore it was not to be wondered at that Splendacious should command the lion's share of attraction in the paddock. \"And what do you think of your chance now?\" The speaker was Manisty. He had come down to Stanford 86"], [95, "Cosford Steeplechases. 87 Hall on the previous evening, and had been surprised to find that Dashwood had moved his quarters, though he was not without a suspicion of the true cause. \"The horse looks fit enough, doesn't he? A shade too finely drawn if anything. As far as I can make out there'll be seventeen starters; but barring accidents, I'm only afraid of Tipster's mount, Firefly. The horse ran third in the Grand National last year. Tipster will have to put up a lot of weight, but the old horse could carry a ton. There's that fellow Langton ! I wonder what game he is up to. He has been loafing about Stanford for the last three days.\" \"Not much good, I expect. He is talking to that scamp Stone, who was warned off for three years, and ought never to have been let on to the turf again. Give him a wide berth, if he is riding against you. There goes the bell for the first race.\" Manisty and Dashwood went back to the Stand to join the Stanford party who were present in strong force. As Edith Clavering watched the two men approach, a feeling of nervousness came over her, which she was unable to account for ; it was a weird, indefinable sense of impending disaster, and she had hardly recovered her usual composure, when Dashwood spoke to her. He had only seen her once in the hunting field since he left Stanford Hall, and to-day had ridden over from Stanford instead of coming on the drag with the house party, in order to avoid her. \" Will you wish me luck ?\" he asked, as he held out his hand. \"With all my heart. You deserve to win. But was it necessary to banish yourself from the world ? \" \" Not necessary, but advisable,\" he replied meaningly, \" and yet, after all my self-denial, I don't feel like winning.\" \" Not feel like winning ! \" Gertrude interrupted, \" Why I thought that the race was as good as over.\" \" You will find that other people think differently, for I don't believe that Splendacious will start favourite. Well what is it ? \" \"Telegram, sir.\" Dashwood opened the telegram, and for a moment looked annoyed."], [96, "88 Society Rogues. \" At all events there is a determined opposition to the horse in the London clubs, so my agent wires me. AVhere is Stanford.\" \" Here I am ! Any news ? \" \" Yes.\" Dashwood drew him apart, and showed him the telegram. \" There is a screw loose somewhere. There is a com mission out to lay against Splendacious ; somebody is making a one-horse book, as you can see.\" \" AVire back to have a monkey on. I feel as confident as ever.\" \" Do you ? The business seems funny to my mind, I only hope that nobody means to interfere with me. I must keep a sharp look out for squalls. Manisty tells me that that fellow- Langton imagines that he owes me a grudge.\" \" I fancy that he imagines that he owes us all a grudge. But I don't know what he can do, for he has no money to lay against us.\" '^ All the more reason why he would make a certainty of our losing, if he has anything to do with this opposition. Anyhow, he has been hanging about Stanford off and on for some time. Vour father-in-law had one interview with him, though of course I don't know what about. They're off now ; I'll see this race and then I must change.\" \" All right. I'll hang about and keep an eye on Langton.\" The first two races, a hurdle race and a hunter's flat race call for little or no comment. Then there was an interval of forty minutes before the big race of the afternoon, to give the public a chance of inspecting the competitors in the paddock ; and many and varied were the criticisms uttered by the local farmers, though the majority were favourable to Splendacious, who looked the picture of a thoroughly-trained steeplechaser. Yet though he was greatly fancied, and his admirers did not hesitate to back their opinions, his price did not materially shorten, while Captain Tipster's mount, Firefly, always remained a steady favourite. Harry Stanford came up to Dashwood as he was entering the weighing-room. \"I've seen and spoken to Langton, He says he has a commission to back Firefly.\""], [97, "Cosford Steeplechases. 89 \" It doesn't emanate from the stable, at all events,\" Dashwood remarked drily. On his way down to the starting flag, Dashwood overtook Manisty and Edith Clavering. \" AA'alking down to see you come over the open grave,\" the former shouted out. Dashwood bent down in his saddle, and answered in hardly above a whisper, \" Keep your eyes open. I more than suspect foul play.\" Training had done much to subdue the temper of Splendacious, and both in the preliminary canter, and when he came under the orders of the starter he evinced no signs of unruliness ; but took matters as quietly as Galtee Moore could have done, and apparently thought he was only out for an exercise gallop. But with seventeen starters, there was naturally a good deal of delay at the post, chiefly caused by the horse which Stone was riding, who came in for a sharp reprimand from the starter. This succession of false starts made Splendacious irritable, and when at last the flag dropped, he got off so badly as to be almost left behind. The course was a stiff, natural one, and two formidable fences had to be negotiated before the competitors came to the water, a deep natural brook, and not a tin-pan imitation, in front of the Grand Stand. Two refusals at the first fence and a nasty cropper at the second, had reduced the field to fourteen, who charged the brook almost in line, for Splendacious had already made up his lost ground, and was doing his best to pull his jockey out of the pigskin. No casualty happened at the water, but on turning at a sharp angle, out into the country, horses were confronted with an awkward thickset hedge, Captain Tipster on the favourite, Firefly, was first over, but Stone's mount swerved clean out of the course and nearly upset Splendacious, who refused in consequence, and Dashwood, good jockey though he was, had a narrow escape of being unshipped. However, with a muttered curse decidedly detrimental to Stone's neck, he managed to get Splendacious round, but the horse's temper was up and he refused twice again, before Dashwood literally spurred hirri over, jumping nearly at a stand."], [98, "Society Rogues. 90 \" Go on, sir. You're not beat yet. Five of them came down at the blackthorn and there's sure to be a scrimmage at the post and-rails.\" The encouraging voice came from one of Hendon's men. Dashwood nodded his thanks as he took in the situalion at a glance, and continued on his journey. Splendacious now seemed to be ashamed of his behaviour, as perhaps he was, and did his best to atone for it by taking the blackthorn and the open ditch in irreproachable style, and raced after the leaders down to the most formidable fence in the race. This was a stout double post and rails, with a thickset fence between, situated on the top of a most forbidding bank. Indeed two of the stewards had objected to the fence as dangerous, but Sir Archibald, following the advice of Dashwood, had given his casting vote in favour of its being retained. \" I ought to win over that fence, Dashwood had said ; but he had not reckoned on having to ride at it in the wake of eight other horses, and having been obliged to push Splendacious along so early in the race. The first three horses charged it pluckily enough, but two collided and came down on the far side. Three more refused. The other two cleared it ; but one fell, by landing on one of the horses that had collided. Then came the turn of Splendacious. That he meant to have it Dashwood could see by the way he cocked his ears and laid hold of his bit. The next moment he was poising in mid-air and Dashwood wondered for a second whether he was ever coming to earth again. Then he was galloping again with only two horses in front of him. \"Splendacious is creeping up,\" resounded from the Ring, where fancy odds had been laid against him when he refused. But the gap was still a big one and it was evident that Tipster had plenty in hand. Over the brook a second time, where it was not so wide as opposite the stand, and now they were only three fences from home. But they were fences which wanted jumping ; and the first one caused the second horse to turn turtle, leaving Splendacious and Firefly alone with some ten lengths between"], [99, "Cosford Steeplechases. 91 them. At the second fence the gap was reduced to five lengths, and there was hardly a length between them when they jumped into the straight. \" Splendacious wins.\" \"No he doesn't.\" \" Dashwood riding already.\" Such were the cries that went up from the Ring, as the two horses seemed to be racing neck and neck. But judges of racing could see that the race was over. The refusal of Splendacious had been fatal, and though he had run gallantly to retrieve his error, it was impossible for him to recover his lost ground. So when Dashwood called on him for a last effort, it was only to find that he had shot his bolt ; and Tipster won easily by three lengths. \" You had bad luck, Major Dashwood,\" Tipster said after they had weighed in, \" or you would have beaten me easily.\" \" I might have made a better race of it, but that fellow, Stone, swerved across me. It was enough to make any horse refuse.\" \" H'm ! I should like to see Stone's book on the race. He ought never to have received his license again, in my opinion. But he is so deuced artful, that it will be hard to catch him trip ping again. You couldn't swear that he was guilty of foul riding to-day, could you ? \" \" No. I thought it was suspicious. But come into the Stand. Lookers-on see most of the race, as a rule. If he deliberately pulled his horse round, he would be seen from the Stand. Ah ! Here comes Stanford ! \" \" I must congratulate you, Captain Tipster,\" Harry Stanford said with the courtesy of a true sportsman. \"Thanks; though it was a case of luck. If your horse had not been interfered with, the result of the race would have been very different.\" \" Ah ! I was coming to ask about it. Shall you lodge any complaint, Dashwood ? \" \" I can't very well. I have no proof. AVhat do you think about it, Manisty?\" he added, as the latter gentleman strolled up. \" AVe can only grin and bear our losses, as far as I can see."], [100, "Society Rogues. 92 Stone would only say that no complaint would ever have been lodged, if it had not been for his own past history, and would pose as a persecuted man. If you give him enough rope, he is sure to hang himself before long. But Langton is the man I should like to catch.\" \" May I ask the reason for that remark, Mr. Manisty ? \" Neither of the four men had noticed the approach of Langton and his question took them by surprise. Manisty was the first to recover his self-possession. \" I am not bound to answer the question, sir ; but as you heard my last remark, probably you heard the one that preceded it about Stone. I, for one, do not believe that his horse swerved accidentally.\" \u2022' I will make you suffer for this.\" \" In that case I shall have to prove my words,\" Manisty replied carelessly. \" You must excuse my continuing our conversation now, interesting as it is ; but I have other things to attend to.\" Then the four men moved away, leaving Langton scowling after them. \" You may think yourselves a clever division, but I've been too sharp for you this time,\" he muttered. The remainder of the racing was of little interest to the reader, except that one event fell to the Stanford stable. But Stone did not ride again after his performance in the big race. He had quietly left the course and taken an early train back to London ; a strategic movement which had been noticed by Manisty and Mr. John Castor, and of which they immediately availed them selves as will be seen hereafter in due course, as the legal story books say. But Langton thinking that he had nothing to fear, remained till the racing was over and then adjourned to tha Stanford Arms, where he had retained a bedroom. He felt jubilant, as most people do, who have earned money and think that they are certain of getting it ; and though as a rule he was an abstemious man, he went into the smoking-room and, ordering a bottle of champagne, asked a well-known bookmaker with whom he had had some small bets during the afternoon, to join him."], [101, "Cosford Steeplechases. 93 \" AVell, Mr. Langton. I suppose you about skinned the lamb over the big race, eh ? Lucky for you that Stone's horse swerved and put Splendacious out of it.\" \" Hang Stone, and his horse swerving ! The Stanford people seem to think that I made the horse swerve, because I happened to have a fairly good race. But then losers always complain.\" \" Not always ; especially when the losses are borne by a millionaire like Mr. Castor. At all events, they didn't lodge a complaint to-day. But that was not necessary.\" \" How do you mean ? \" The bookmaker smiled as he leant back, and drank a glass of champagne. \" How do you mean ? \" Langton reiterated. \" AA'hy ! AA'here were you born, Mr. Langton ? Not on a race course, that's a certainty. There was no complaint to make against the winner, Firefly. Captain Tipster is far too well known a gentleman to be suspected of being in league with Stone. So is the owner of Firefly. But Stone never weighed in, and left the course before the stewards had time to carpet him. In any case Stone will lose his qualification as a qualified rider, as he rode for hire. The matter will be reported, and Stone is sure to sell his employers. I know him better than you do.\" \"I daresay you do. But do you class me amongst\" his employers ? \" The bookmaker laughed aloud this time. \"The question is, will Stone class you amongst his employers? Come, Mr. Langton, you have some money in your pocket, will you make a ready-money bet ? \" \"AVhat for?\" \" Say a pony ! If you don't like to hand over to me, hand over to old Jack Parkins the landlord, and I'll do the same.\" \" AVell ! AVhat's the bet ? \" \" That you are warned off the Turf within a fortnight from to-day ? \" * Don't be a fool, man ! \" Langton replied, affecting to smile, though he felt and looked very uncomfortable."], [102, "Society Rogues. 94 \" I was never more serious in my life.\" And to prove that he meant it, the bookmaker placed five five-pound notes on the table before him, and turning round to the room, shouted out the terms of the bet. Biting his lip to suppress his rage, Langton covered the money. \" I suppose it is the wiser policy to take money from men like you, than to thrash you,\" he said as he got up and left the room. And yet Langton did not enjoy his dinner."], [103, "95 CHAPTER XIV. A Denouement. EAVING Langton to enjoy or not to enjoy his dinner, in a degree to be proportioned by ill news, an uneasy conscience, and an indifferent menu, we will enter the dining-room at Stanford Hall, where, at all events, the menu was excellent, though many of the guests wore gloomy looks. Perhaps the gloomiest of all the guests was Major Dash wood. In the first place, he had lost a race which he had set his heart upon winning. Consolation in these events is worse than silence. Captain Tipster, who was dining at Stanford Hall, had told him that he would certainly have won, if it had not been for that unlucky refusal ; but Dashwood knew as well, as if Tipster had told him, that the latter would have ridden a very different race, if Splendacious had not refused. Still no jockey likes to owe his defeat to foul riding, and Dashwood, though he was un able to prove it, was perfectly certain in his own mind that Stone had made his horse swerve on purpose. He did not grudge Tipster his victory. Men, who really do ride well, are never jealous of each other, but are content to leave jealousy, whether on the race-course or in the hunting field, to those thrusting scoundrels, who would be nowhere, unless they took undue advantage of their opponents. But he was sorry for the Stanfords, both Harry and Sir Archibald, who he knew must have lost heavily on the big race of the day, and he was sorry for his own reputation, since he had undertaken tc manage the Stanford stable. Yet his racing disappointment, was a mere triviality in comparison with his"], [104, "Society Rogues. 96 second disappointment. He had been beaten in another race, a race for which few enter, unless they feel sure to win ; a race for which the prize is a woman's heart. Certainly Dashwood could not blame Edith Clavering for this second disappointment. She had given him no encouragement, to use the vulgar, unmeaning phrase of society ; and, when she saw, as a woman only can see, that he was in love with her, she told him not to propose. \" She let him down lightly,\" would have been the verdict of Clubland, if Clubland had known. But Club land was never likely to know the secret of Major Dashwood's second disappointment. There are certain defeats which men do not publish, though society (?) journals occasionally publish them for them. But to-night Major Dashwood was not in Clubland. He was in the society of ladies, whose eyes, could, as he well knew, penetrate his secret. He saw through it all now. Gertrude had invited Edith Clavering to Stanford Hall with the express intention that he should fall in love with her, and he had done as she wished. She did not know that Edith Clavering was already engaged. How could she know ? The engagement had never been made public. He had only learnt it himself this evening, when Manisty had told him of it in the smoking-room, before they dressed for dinner. And Manisty had asked him for his congratulations, and he had congratulated his rival ! AVhy not ? He had been refused, and Manisty had been accepted. And yet a trial of love is different to a trial of sport. Every good sportsman will congratulate his rival on his success ; but in the case of lovers \u2014 well \u2014 let the lover who has been refused answer the question. For students of history will only refer one to the words of the catechism, hatred, malice, and all uncharitable ness. AVe cry pardon. AVe had forgotten that we were writing at the end of the nineteenth century. AA'e must hark back to the scent of our story, namely the scent of the dining-room at Stan ford Hall."], [105, "A denouement. 97 However gloomy may be the feelings of the diners it is next \u25a0to an impossibility for people to remain for long in a funereal state, whose appetites are sharpened by a long day on a race-course in December. Conversation may be carried on under difficulties during the soup and fish, but the first glass of champagne generally loosens the tongue, and lends a certain charm to the most distasteful subjects whether human or conversational, and Dashwood even was soon engaged in a discussion with the vicar's wife as to whether or not boys from the Sunday School were cor ruptedby going into racing stables, while the Reverend Bartholomew Bottlemug was waxing wroth on the action of a certain bishop who had lately issued a prohibition against his clergy hunting. \" Nonsense ! Of course it's nonsense. AVhy, isn't a clergy man, the Reverend E. M. Reynolds, now the Master of the Coniston? AVasn't Jack Russell an M.F.H? Besides, what would happen if some poor fellow broke his neck, and wanted spiritual consolation, if there was no clergyman in the field ? I don't mean that, exactly ; but if his friends wanted spiritual consolation.\" \" AVhy, the parson, like the doctor, would be far more likely to be at the stern of hounds, than at the scene of the accident.\" John Castor said, with the view of flattering the parson. \" Then he would pull up and go back,\" Bottlemug retorted more fiercely than John Castor expected, and Dashwood seemed languidly surprised at his vehemence, till the vicar's wife explained to him, that once when Bottlemug was holding his own in the first flight, he left the field to visit an old woman, who was not a parish ioner of his, because somebody told him that her own clergyman was away from home. Dashwood regarded Bottlemug with more reverence than he had done before. \" No, sir; \" Bottlemug continued, addressing himself particu larly to John Castor. \" It's all nonsense to say that parsons should not hunt. I cut out an advertisement the other day, from an old number of the St. James's Chronicle, dated close on a century ago, which read as follows : ' AVanted immediately, a good, strong, bony man to act in the capacity of curate. He must be subject to the following particulars, viz., to have no objection to act as gar- G"], [106, "98 Society Rogues. dener, husbandman, and an occasional whipper-in. Any gent whom the above may suit, on application to Mr. B. at the Gray's-inn Coffee House, Holborn, may meet with immediate employ. N.B. Character will not be so much required as equestrian skill, and none need apply who have not undergone a complete stabal arian education.' No, sir; in those times the clergy came from a far hardier race than they do now. They were country gentle men ; sportsmen, if you like, but they knew and were reverenced and loved by their parishioners, which is more than can be said of the slipper-shod weaklings, who hail from theological colleges.\" AA'hatever effect Mr. Bottl emug's speech may have had upon John Castor, it had the effect upon the general company of diverting the conversation into the channels of the hunting field. Yet Manisty could hardly keep his eyes off Dashwood. Edith had told him what he had suspected, that Dashwood had been on the verge of falling in love w_h her, but he had not thought that such a list less man, could be so hard hit, as Dashwood appeared to be. He was annoyed, for he had felt a genuine friendship for Dashwood ; but he knew that old lovers are dangerous friends for young wives. And yet to a certain extent he was glad. The cavalry captain had always assumed an indefinable, perhaps unconscious, air of superiority towards the scribbler in AA'ine Office Court, whe seemed to make the Old Cheshire Cheese his club, and preferred Fleet Street to Pall Mall. Now, literature had beaten the House hold Brigade. The ladies had retired, and the wine was on its second voyage of circulation when a servant entered and handed a telegram to Mr. Castor. After reading it the latter said quietly. \" Stone received a hundred pounds down, and a promise of another hundred from Langton, to interfere with Splendacious, so as to prevent him from winning his race.\" The excitement caused by this speech may be imagined. Everybody in the same breath, asked Castor for an explanation except Manisty, who already knew all about it. Mr. Castor resumed. \"This telegram merely says that Stone has confessed, but the"], [107, "A denouement. 99 reason, which led him to confess, is a long story. Langton and Stone have had many dealings together, though in many instances Langton was not aware of the fact, but thought that he was dealing with Mrs. Delamaine, who I am sorry to say, was once on my daughter's visiting list. In reality he was dealing with Stone, who is Mrs. Delamaine's brother. As Manisty can tell you, this came to my knowledge in rather a curious way.\" Manisty leaning back, and listlessly smoking his cigarette with the air of a man who knaws perfectly well what is coming, murmured assent. \" It partly came to pass under this roof when I came down to discuss certain mining business with Sir Archibald, which is now public property; but which it was then important for us to keep secret. I had some previous knowledge of Langton as a stock broker's tout, with a rather too inquisitive mind, and thinking that he might gather some information, which he could sell, and which might harm our mining projects, I got him out of the way by paying him an exorbitant price for doing some unimportant work for me in the City. Mrs. Delamaine remained behind, and did find out the very information which I had been afraid of Langton finding out. But she did not know the value of it, and did not impart it to Langton till it was useless. Langton then tried to do a little blackmailing on his own account, but only ruined him self by giving away Mrs. Delamaine. I mean that he made us suspect him.\" \"AVho was us?\" Harry Stanford inquired \"Mr. Manisty and m_self. I made a confidant of Mr. Manisty, because \u2014 well \u2014 because I did.\" \" A very Micawber-like explanation,\" Manisty interrupted, \"say rather for reasons connected with financial journalism.\" \" As you like. Then, as Major Dashwood knows, Langton kept hanging about Stanford and behaving generally like a racing tout. This of itself was suspicious in connection with these Cosford races, so I bought Mrs. Delamaine. This was not difficult to do considering the knowledge which I had of her, gained partly from Langton and partly from private detectives. The G 2"], [108, "Society Rogues. 100 latter informed me amongst other things that Stone, the jockey who had been warned off and who has only just regained his license, was the lady's brother. It was easy to buy Stone and then easy to buy Mrs. Delamaine. Indeed it was their interest to be bought.\" \" How so ? \" \" Because naturally they would rather work for people with money, than for a pauper like Langton.\" \" Set a thief to catch a thief,\" said the Reverend Bartholomew Bottlemug, who had been listening intently. \" Exactly so, Mr. Bottlemug, though I should hardly suppose that the maxim came under the heading of clerical advice. But having caught Langton, the next question was what should we do with him? AVe,\" and John Castor nodded his head towards Manisty, \" knew that he was working a commission against Splendacious, and that he would bribe Stone to use foul means to prevent the colt winning. But we were in this awkward position, namely, that we had no proof of his intended rascality, for the actual bribery had not as yet taken place, beyond Stone's word. Nor had we that proof until this morning, just before the jockeys weighed out, or we should have taken you into our confidence, Major Dashwood.\" \" AVhile as it was, you allowed me to run the chance of breaking my neck,\" Dashwood said, as angrily as it was in his indolent nature to say anything. \" I may not, and I am glad to say, that I do not understand the morals of the Stock Exchange, but I do understand the morals of racing amongst honourable gentlemen. I beg to state emphatically \" \" Pardon me, Major Dashwood, interrupting you ; but listen to the end of our explanation. AAre had no absolute proof till the moment before Stone weighed out. He was the last jockey to weigh out, and you were one of the first. By the time I had that proof you were half-way to the winning-post, so I could not tell you that part of Stone's extra weight consisted of Langton's cheque for a hundred pounds, though Manisty did warn you to steer a clear course of Stone. If Stone had not received that"], [109, "A denouement. 101 cheque, but only Langton's promise, he was to allow Splendacious to run on his merits. In any case he was to interfere with you in such a way that you should not come to grief; not a difficult thing for such a tricky horseman as Stone to do. You must admit that he carried out these instructions.\" \"Yes ; or I suppose that I should not be sitting here.\" \" Stone goes up to town, immediately after the race without going through the formality of weighing in. At this very moment he is spreading this tale which I have just told you, through the clubs, or is causing it to be spread. He will present Langton's cheque to-morrow morning as soon as the bank opens, and send an affidavit of the proceedings to the National Hunt Committee. Langton will not receive one farthing of his winnings, and will be a hundred pounds out of pocket, besides being warned off the Turf.\" \"And he ought to be prosecuted into the bargain,\" Captain Tipster said emphatically, speaking for the first time. \" Major Dashwood, I am not going to pass any opinion upon this unpleasant matter. One thing is evident, namely, that I did not win by fair means. I can say on behalf of my friend Lord Rugby, the owner of Firefly, that he will not touch a halfpenny of the stakes, and I propose that we make a match at the same weights and over the same course, between Splendacious and Firefly ; you as the aggrieved party, to fix the date.\" Whatever objections Major Dashwood had to ride for any stable again in which Mr. Castor was concerned, he could not refuse this sporting offer, especially when Harry Stanford pressed him to accept it. So the conditions of the match were drawn up and ratified on the spot. Still Major Dashwood was naturally angry both with Mr. Castor and Manisty. He thought, and perhaps with truth, that they had served him a shabby trick, and inwardly registered a vow that it should not be long before he cried quits with them."], [110, "102 CHAPTER XV. The Beginning of the End. AD John Castor made a mistake ? This was the question which Howard Manisty asked himself when he woke on the morning following the Cosford steeple chases. And this question was succeeded by another, namely, if John Castor had made a mistake, had he, Howard Manisty, lent himself to the mistake? Taking everything into consideration, Howard Manisty was inclined to answer both questions in the affirmative. AA'hatever might be the verdict of the National Hunt Committee in reference to Langton, there could be no possible doubt that John Castor had laid a trap, in order to ruin a man who was a source of danger to himself. Howard Manisty knew the public opinion of turfites far too well, not to be fully aware that the sympathy of a large section of the racing public, would be extended to the poor man, who had been ruined by the millionaire. In the opinion of many turfites Langton's sin would be pardonable. AA'hat had he done ? He had merely bribed a fifth-rate jockey, to interfere with a horse in order to get the better of a nouveau riche who had, on his own showing, paid people of questionable character, to sell him, Langton. Then came a further question. John Castor had permitted, nay even advised the jockey to accept the bribe, and to interfere with the horse. Now, if the result of this interference, -and a not improbable result \u2014 had been that Major Dashwood"], [111, "Tlie beginning of the end. 103 had broken his neck, John Castor would undoubtedly have been prosecuted for manslaughter. Again, had not John Castor over reached himself? AA'ould not Stone defend himself by saying that he had acted under compulsion ? Such were the first questions which occurred to Howard Manisty in his waking moments. Then other questions occurred to him. Dashwood, after being his friend, was now his enemy. He was engaged to the girl, with whom Dashwood had been in love, and for whom he had resigned his commission in the Household Brigade. If Dashwood were called upon to give evidence before the National Hunt Committee, would he not do his best to incriminate him ? It was an unpleasant combination of circumstances. Manisty fancied that he saw the leading articles in the sporting papers asking, why, for the sake of a few paltry hundreds, should a millionaire ruin a poor man over a hunt steeplechase ? There might be references to himself, in which case, Edith Clavering's father, might ask him for an explanation. And, in addition, there was this Stock Exchange business, in which he had admittedly helped John Castor. There is, perhaps, no greater misfortune in this world, though it is a very common misfortune, than to be drawn into a quasi partnership, without knowing where it will end, till the end finds one in Queer Street. AVe may not, and in ninety-nine cases cut of a hundred, do not, know the real business of the partnership, but the world presumes that we do know it. Hence, public opinion annually finds thousands of people guilty of dishonesty, whose only fault has been carelessness. Such was the case with Howard Manisty. In the multiplicity of details connected with his busi ness as a journalist, details political, financial, theatrical, and social, he had omitted to examine the details of his racing con nection with John Castor. This may seem extraordinary, for Manisty was a good man to hounds, and though he had never matriculated as a racing reporter, had that general knowledge of racing, which every educated man is presumed to possess at the present day. The presumption is generally correct. Do we not know, how a certain prominent bookmaker, having been intro-"], [112, "Society Rogues. 104 duced to and conversed with the late Earl of Beaconsfield, said of him, that no wonder he was the first politician in England, for nobody knew more than he did about the points of a race-horse. Yet to the best of our belief, the Earl of Beaconsfield's knowledge of race-horses was confined to what he learnt from the Earl of Bradford when visiting at Weston. But this is a digression. Manisty, worried by his misgivings, was unable to sleep, and though the day had barely dawned, determined to dress and try to relieve his mind by a brisk walk. So, much to the surprise of a couple of sleepy housemaids, he left the house and walked through the park in the direction of Stanford. AVhen he reached the old-fashioned bridge by which the road crossed the little river Stan, he was surprised to see Langton leaning over the parapet. Langton, after his conversation with the bookmaker, had passed a sleepless night, and like Manisty, had determined to try the effects of morning air. On hearing footsteps he turned round and an angry expression came over his face, as he recognized to whom they belonged. \"This is a fortunate meeting, Mr. Manisty. I was thinking of you.\" \" Indeed ! I feel proud, I'm sure.\" Manisty replied non chalantly. \"I want to know what you meant by saying what you did yesterday.\" \" I thought my words were plain enough. However, to speak more plainly, I suspected that you had bribed Stone to interfere with Splendacious.\" \" And how dare you suspect such a thing? \" \" Strong language, Mr. Langton.\" \" And I intend to use still stronger language. You and your friends lost your money, and, because I happened to be on the winning side, you accuse me of malpractices.\" \" Not in the least. On the contrary, I happened to back Firefly, before I knew that you had given Stone a cheque for a hundred pounds. Don't start, man ! You see my suspicions were correct.\""], [113, "The beginning of the end. 105 \" I don't admit it.\" \"That is wise of you, but at all events it is the truth, as the whole of the racing world will know before next Monday. You happened to be beaten with your own weapons, namely, bribery and corruption.\" \" Then I understand that you bribed Stone.\" Manisty laughed. \"That is hardly likely,\" he answered. \"You forget or else do not know that my business is entirely unconnected with racing. I never had more than a ten-pound note on a horse in my life.\" \" AA'hat are you then ? A private detective ? \" \" No, not that either. My business, as a matter of fact is journalism, though that does not concern you.\" \" Then who did bribe Stone ? \" \"How should I know? You ought to know, better than I do, whose interest it was to bribe him. Anyhow he sold you. You played with sharp tools and got cut, as many a man has been who thinks himself clever, though what could have induced you to play with them on this occasion, I can't for the life of me imagine, considering that it was any odds that you were found out. Fool as you have proved yourself to be, I don't suppose for a moment that you were such an idiot as to do this on account of any petty spite you may have against Stanford or Dashwood. Besides, what would be the loss of a few hundreds to them ? \" \" What would be the gain of a few hundreds to me? To a ruined gambler it represents a fortune. If I could get the fortune at the expense of men whom I hate, so much the better.\" Langton spoke so vehemently, that Manisty was astonished. \" Hate them ! AVhy what on earth have either them done to you ? \" \" Done to me ! AA'hy, if it had not been for Harry Stanford might not I have married Gertrude Castor in the first place ? In the second place, when that was impossible, if it had not been for Major Dashwood, might not I have managed the Stanford horses ? Then to add insult to injury, did they not practically turn me out"], [114, "Society Rogues. 106 of Stanford Hall? You were staying in the house at the time so ought to know.\" \" Yes. Mr. Castor gave you fifty pounds to go.\" It was Langton's turn to be astonished. \" How did you know that ? \" he asked impatiently. \" Because Mr. Castor told me so. He did not want you to discover what your friend Mrs. Delamaine discovered and told to you ; but you were too late in the field then. As to Stanford, you never had the most remote chance of marrying Miss Castor ; nor was it in the slightest degree probable that Sir Archibald, would have let you have anything to do with his horses. I may tell you that it was arranged before their marriage that Major Dashwood should manage them. You must see now that you have no cause for your hatred.\" \"But I do hate them, if only for the reason that they have succeeded where I have failed, but I'll be even with them yet. They may have me warned off the Turf, but mark my words, I'll have my revenge.\" Manisty leaning listlessly against the parapet of the bridge, regarded his companion as one might regard an interesting but harmless lunatic, yet he saw that this man might become dangerous. \" I'll be revenged upon the whole lot of you,\" Langton con tinued fiercely. \" A ruined man can afford to be desperate.\" \" Pooh ! Don't talk nonsense, because you have been discovered perpetrating the silliest fraud that w-as ever dreamt of. You were certain to be found out. AVhy, suspicion was aroused directly your commission was in the market. AA'ho ever heard of such a commission over a tin-pot hunt steeplechase? Then, when the commission was traced to a ruined gambler \u2014 I use your own expression \u2014 the suspicion became a certainty ; especially when you were seen in earnest conversation with a man who would sell his own grandmother for a sovereign.\" \" Still, whoever bought Stone, must have paid five hundred for him. Now to whom could Stone be worth five hundred ? Tell me that ! \" \"I can't tell you,\" Manisty said, for it was his object to"], [115, "The beginning of the end. 107 prevent Langton from suspecting John Castor, though sooner or later, he would be sure to discover that it was John Castor who was his enemy. \" Probably Stone saw that the game was up, and thojght it best to make a clean breast of it. I guess that he was to have a share in your winnings, but when he saw that there would be no winnings to share, he took what he could get.\" \" And who will believe Stone?\" Langton asked, as a gleam of hope dawned upon him. \" I deny the whole transaction ; what then ? \" \" An explanation why you gave him a cheque for a hundred pounds. You did not give it to him for nothing, I presume?\" \" No. I lost it to him over the Manchester November Handicap, as my betting-book can prove. Thank you, Mr. Manisty, for this interview. You have shown me who my enemies are. Forewarned is fore-armed. I am deeply obliged to you for telling me so specifically of what I am going to be accused. But you forget the legal maxim which presumes that the accused is innocent until he is found guilty. If you and your friends rely upon the word of a man like Stone, as proof against me or any body else every racing man in the kingdom will laugh at you. As for you, personally, I shall instruct my solicitor to bring an action for slander against you, for the words which you said yesterday on the race-course to your two friends and Captain Tipster. You spoke to me just now about silly frauds and called me a fool ; but nobody but a fool would have dreamt of backing Major Dashwood on Splendacious against Captain Tipster on Firefly. Good-mornin.', Mr. Manisty, unless you have any further information to give me.\" \" I will give you the name of my solicitor, who will accept service of the writ in the action for slander, which you purpose to bring against me, if you like ; though it is useless, as you do not intend to bring it. However, you know my address in Wine Office Court.\" \" Perfectly. Good-morning, and renewed thanks.\" Langton walked off, affecting to whistle carelessly. Manisty watched him till he was out of sight, and then returned to Stanford"], [116, "Society Rogues. 108 Hall to acquaint John Castor of his interview, whom he found busy already at his desk, amidst a perfect sea of documents. The latter listened in silence till the end of the story. \" It is the last resource of a bold rogue, but Langton was al ways a bully, and like all bullies, a coward at heart. Certainly it is his last card, and the courage of despair might make him play it; but I doubt whether he will when he finds out the relationship between Stone and Mrs. Delamaine. I am glad that you didn't tell him that. But what on earth dragged you out of your bed so early this morning ? \" \" Sleeplessness, I suppose. To tell you the truth, I am worried at the view which Dashwood takes of the business. He thinks that knowing what we did know, we ought not to have allowed Stone to ride at all. Langton will say that we are as guilty as he is. ' Set a thief to catch a thief ' is a very good copy book maxim, but I doubt whether the National Hunt Committee will consider that we were justified in putting it into practice.\" \" Why should our names appear in the matter at all ? Stone will not mention them. Langton, according to your own account, suspects Dashwood and Harry Stanford.\" \"But can you depend upon Stone and Mrs. Delamaine?\" \"Yes, for the good reason that their silence and complicity are not yet paid for, and will not be paid for till the matter is over. AVhen do you go up to town ? \" \" This afternoon. I have to escort Miss Clavering to her father, with whom I suppose I shall have an interview.\" \" AVell, I wish you joy ! I shall remain here for the next few days, to superintend this mining business. You will write to me daily?\" \" Yes ; if there is anything to tell you.\" \" I expect that there will be plenty to tell me. This mining scheme does not work as smoothly as I should wish. The Star Railway shares have not fallen as I anticipated, and as in the ordinary course of business they would have fallen. On the contrary they remain as firm as ever.\" \"So I see from the papers. AVhat do you augur?\""], [117, "The beginning of the end. 109 \" That a powerful syndicate is working against me. I know that it is so. I need hardly tell you, Manisty, that a man, who, like myself, rises from comparative poverty to great wealth, makes many enemies, who would only be too glad to dance at his bankruptcy. I am no exception to the rule. I have a whole army of enemies, and not a single friend in this world. I stand alone, and I am older than I thought I was. I can trust you not to say a word of this ? \" \" Certainly ; but I fancy that you exaggerate matters. You have been over-working yourself, and your nerves are a bit shaken.\" \" Perhaps so. But where would my business be, :f I did not overwork myself? I have, as men term it, overworked myself all my life, or I should not be where I am now.

No, I cannot do that. Besides the matter has gone too far. Come and see me before you leave, for I shall not appear downstairs, till the evening.\" And he pointed to the mass of documents in silent explanation. Manisty left the room, for he saw that it would be worse than useless to attempt to dissuade Castor from his work, though it was evident that he was not fit for it. He had driven his brain at express speed all his life, and the machinery was beginning to wear out. \" Poor devil ! \" Manisty muttered, as he went down to the breakfast room ; \" In spite of his millions, I would not change places with him. But has he got all these millions which he is reputed to have? H'm ! I am afraid there is thunder in the air about Stanford Hall.\""], [118, "110 CHAPTER XVI. AA'as it Mu_de_ ? EFORE leaving Stanford Hall, Howard Manisty went to see Mr. Castor as he had promised. He found him still deeply engrossed in work, he had hardly tasted the luncheon which had been brought to his study, and his face wore the haggard expression of a man who was overworked and worried. Manisty, who in his early days had often worked on the stretch for twenty hours, knew the symptoms well, and at the risk of offending the elder man, did not hesitate to speak some strong words of warning. \" I know that you are perfectly right, and that you mean well, but what am I to do ? This work has to be done, an 1 I am the only man that can do it. I dare say that I do not look well now, but I quickly recuperate, and after a day's rest shall be as fresh as ever. Should you hear any reports in town about my being in ill-health, I wish you would contradict them.\" \" Certainly, but is it likely that I shall hear them?\" \" Yes, and if they were believed, the consequences would be very bad. There are many people who could make capital out of my illness. Before now, my own servants have been paid to give reports about my health, and of course, true or false, they will issue the reports for which they are paid best. But there is a mine of strength left in me yet, as my opponents will find out. AVrite to me about this Langton business, something is sure to be known by to-morrow, if not to-night. By-the-bye, in what sort of a temper was Dashwood this morning ? \""], [119, "Was it murders 111 ' I have not seen him alone, for he seems to have purposely avoided me. I may tell you in confidence that he was in low with Miss Clavering, so that may account for it.

AVhat is the matter with Gertie ? \" \" AVell, for one thing, she savoured Dashwood's suit; and then she is angry about Splendacious losing, and so, like all women and monarchs, is angry with the first person she comes across.

Ah ! my dear Manisty, I wish that we had met earlier in life. Still, better late than never ! I won't detain you now. Good-bye ! \" The two men shook hands warmly, and in another ten minutes Manisty and Miss Clavering were driving to the railway station. Manisty remained for dinner at Mr. Clavering's house, so it was past eleven o'clock when he entered his club, a well known literary club, where editors could enjoy creature comforts without the risk of being pestered by sycophantine journalists. As yet the club was comparatively empty, for the wheel of editorial labour was still revolving in the precincts of Fleet Street ; but the man of all others whom Manisty most desired to see was occupying his usual chair in the smoking-room. He was a white-haired gentleman of over seventy, with the benevolent appearance of an amiable churchw-arden. Nobody would have taken him for what he really was, namely, the assistant editor of the first sporting paper in the world. \" How are you, my dear boy ? You are the very man that I wanted to see, for I hear that you were at these Cosford Races. A nice little scandal they created. The anti-gambling league, the humanitarian league, and all the other leagues, sounded in the"], [120, "Society Rogues. 112 interests of incipient insanity will make plenty of capital out of it. However, rest your legs, order a tumbler of your favourite lotion, and tell me all about it.\" \" There is not much to tell,\" Manisty replied, as he settled himself in an armchair, ordered a whisky-and-soda, and lit a cigar. \" A man of the name of Langton gave a jockey of the name of Stone, a hundred pounds to interfere with Stanford's horse Splendacious, and jockey Stone earned his money. That is the history of the race in one sentence.\" \" But what is going to be the sequel? \" \" In two words. ' AA^arned off.' \" \" H'm ! Langton gives a different version.\" \" AVhat do you mean ? To whom has he given it ? \" \"To me, to start with; and I suppose he has been to every office in London. He was very big at the Albert Club, this afternoon.\" \" Isn't it a case of 'qui s'excuse s'accuse' ? \" \"No, for he declares that he has been already accused, and therefore is on his defence. As a matter of fact, he has said that the accusation is a conspiracy to get him warned off, concocted by Stone, a certain Mrs. Delamaine, who appears to be Stone's sister, John Castor, and yourself.\" \" The deuce he does ! AVell, all I can say is that so far as John Castor and I are concerned, the statement is false. My dear Daley, you know me and my business well enough, not to think for one moment, that I should take the trouble to concern myself about such a conspiracy.\" \" I know you wouldn't do anything dishonourable, and of course I should take your word against Langton's ; but I am afraid that my small circle of intimate friends does not include millionaires, so I cannot answer for John Castor.\" \"The very fact of his being a millionaire makes it absurd to think that he would bother to mix himself up in the matter.\" \" H'm ! Millionaires do very queer things sometimes. Langton's version of the matter is that Castor owes him a grudge, and would willingly spend a few thousands to ruin him. Now, to my knowledge, I had never seen Langton before this afternoon,"], [121, "11 'us it murder ? 113 when he came to the office lo contradict the report which Stone had caused to be circulated in the morning, and the first question which occurred to me was, why did Stone circulate the report ? So far as I know, no complaint had been lodged against him.\" \" He never weighed in, and left the course.\" \" Pooh ! That doesn't account for a man like Stone, who is far from being a sanctimonious parson, saying that he has been guilty of foul riding, before anybody has accused him. Langton's version of the affair is the more probable one, though I don't know why he has mixed up your name in the business.\" \" Because I accused him before witnesses on the course.' \" Of what ? Of bribing Stone ? \" \" Practically, yes.\" \" Then I'm sorry for you. But look here, Manisty, what proof had you, when you accused him on the course? Had you seen Stone before he made himself scarce? \" \" Not to speak to ; but I saw Langton give him a piece of paper, which I have no doubt was the cheque for a hundred pounds, just before he weighed out.\" \" I am afraid you jumped at a hasty conclusion. Anyhow, you said what no racing reporter would have dared to write. I don't want to act the part of Job's comforter ; but this fellow Langton, will try to make you pay for what you said. Besides, the powers that be, will be sure to examine into the whole matter, and then \" \"AVell?\" \" AVhy, I pity your friend John Castor.\" \" I think John Castor knows how to take care of himself,\" Manisty said as he rose from his chair, and with a brief good night, left the room. He knew that by this time the editorial wheel of labour had ceased to revolve in the precincts of Fleet Street, so he went home to Wine Office Court to look through his arrears of correspondence. As he was about to open the door. a man came up to him, whom he instantly recognised as Stone. \"I thought you had gone abroad,\" Manisty said, without waiting for the other to speak. li"], [122, "114 Society Rogues. \" Did you ? Then you must have been a flat.\" \" Well, it is a matter of complete indifference to me, where you are.\" \" Is it ? I think not, for I want to have a quiet chat with you, my young friend.\" \" That is awkward, for it is late already, and I have some work to do, and I am afraid that you will always find me too busy for the luxury of a quiet chat with you.\" \"Very well ; then we will make it a matter of business.\" \" You may make it what the deuce you please ; but as I wish to enter this house, I'll trouble you not to stand between me and the door.\" \" I shall move as soon as I have settled my business with you.\" Manisty was no coward, and though he was the wrong side of thirty, he had not forgotten the lessons in the noble art of self- defence, which he had been taught during his school-boy days. Feinting with his left, he brought his right round with an undercut, which if it had hit the mark must have fractured Stone's jaw. But the jockey was too wary for him. Though Manisty was at least two stone heavier than his opponent, Stone was the younger man, and in the better condition. Besides, no sooner had Manisty struck the first blow than he repented for what he had done. Nobody knew better than he did, the disgrace which is attached to being mixed up in a common street fight, whatever the considerations may be ; but to fight a jockey of proven rascality, was an act of folly which it would be difficult to expiate. Even if his opponent had been Langton, a better complexion could have been placed upon the fracas. Stone was too con- versant with the methods of racecourse bullies not to know this, and had made his plans accordingly ; but he had not taken into consideration the fact that Manisty knew more than he did about the theory of fistiana, or he would never have ventured to insult him in a narrow court off Fleet Street, where, in the event of police interference, his word would have no weight against that of Manisty. Another point against him was that he had expected that Manisty would return to his rooms to dress for dinner, so"], [123, "Was it murder ? 115 that he had been loafing about Wine Office Court since six o'clock in the evening with the result that he was now in a state of semi-intoxication which Manisty was not slow to notice. Afraid of interference which might lead to scandal, Manisty's aim was to knock out his opponent as quickly as possible, and in this he succeeded before they had been fighting more than two minutes. Stone, in stepping back just sailed to get out of reach, and received a smashing blow on the side of his head which sent him to the ground. Unfortunately, in falling, the back of his skull struck the edge of the stone step leading into the Old Cheshire Cheese, where he lay senseless ; and Manisty bending down to examine him, saw at once that he was dead. Quickly recovering from the horror caused by this discovery, Manisty left the body where it had fallen and entered his rooms, from the windows of which he could watch the subsequent proceedings. He had not long to wait before the policeman came round on his beat, who after seeing the true nature of the case, summoned the assistance of a comrade, who fetched the divisional police surgeon, and in due course the dead man was conveyed to the station. \"So,\" Manisty muttered to himself, \"you have met with your reward before it was due. 'A jockey found dead on the doorstep of \"The Old Cheshire Cheese,'\" will be the newspaper headline which will form your epitaph, though I wish that I had not been the unconscious cause of your death. The worst of it is that: the Cosford Steeplechase scandal will assume serious proportions- I wonder how it will end ? \" Calm, cold-blooded and hard-hearted as this soliloquy may seem to be, even Manisty was astounded in the morning when he read in the papers, \" Murder of a jockey ! arrest of the supposed. murderer ! \" He eagerly devoured such details, as starving reporters; who call themselves journalists, but have to sleep in the streets, had been able to gather for the early editions of the evening papers. Brief as these details were, they were terrible to Manisty. Charles Langton had been arrested for the wilful murder off Henry Stone. H 2"], [124, "116 Society Rogues. The circumstances which led up to the arrest can be briefly explained, without having recourse to the hyperbolical language of the murder-mongering reporter. Langton and Stone had been seen both drinking together and quarrelling during the evening, and had been forcibly expelled from \"The Old Cheshire Cheese.\" Both men, according to that vague authority, namely information received by the police, had been drinking heavily, and evidence had been forthcoming that they had had a dispute over money matters. They had been seen leaving a public house together at half-past twelve, and the policeman, who discovered the dead body, deposed to hearing them using quarrelsome language in Fleet Street at a quarter to one, and to cautioning them about their behaviour. The later editions of the evening papers had a further report, Charles Langton had been charged at the police court with the -wilful murder of Henry Stone, and had been remanded in custody."], [125, "CHAPTER XVII. Gossip. T IS excessively awkward. Of course the evidence against Langton is of such a flimsy character that, even if he is committed, he will be released on nominal bail ; and if he is sent for trial, the Grand Jury will probably throw out the bill. Therefore, I do not see that there is any necessity for you to make a confession. Langton will be discharged, whether you confess or not, and your confession can't bring Stone to life again.\" \"Yet my silence places Langton under suspicion.'1 \" That is merely a turn of the wheel of fortune, to which all of us are liable. Men who suffer from the influence of prolonged festivity are more liable to these accidents than we who confine our festivities within the limits of sobriety. No, my dear Manisty, take my advice and let sleeping dogs lie. I suppose the Cosford scandal will now die a natural death ? \" \"Tam not so sure of that. As I have told you, the suspicions of the sporting press are aroused.\" \"So I see; and now that every stock-broker takes more interest in racing than he does in his own legitimate business, their innuendoes will do harm to the Stanford mining prospects. These are of paramount importance to me. How far can you help me ? \" John Castor looked Manisty full in the face as he asked the question. The two men thoroughly understood each other. 117"], [126, "r Society Rogues. 118 \" You mean to what extent can I persuade the British public to take up the shares. It is a difficult question to answer.\" \"You mean that the answer depends upon my cheque book.\" \" Not entirely.\" \" Then what does it depend upon ? \" \" The value of your banking account. The world may con sider you a millionaire ; but I happen to know that the world is wrong. Certain combinations, or syndicates \u2014 whatever term you may choose to apply to them \u2014 have been too strong for you. There is hardly a paper which publishes a money article, but what tells its investing readers, to be cautious about investing in any concern in which your name figures.\" \"Yes I know that.\" And Castor pointed to a heap of news papers. \" Well, in order to contradict these reports, I must be able to prove to the city editors of these papers that their reports are false.\" \" AVhat proofs do you require ? \" \" I do not know. You forget that I am not versed in Stock Exchange business.\" \" Suppose that I am unable to give you such proofs as would satisfy these city editors as you term them ? \" \" They would not budge an inch from the hostile position they have taken towards you.\" The financier was silent for some minutes, and Manisty could see that even his fertile brain was at a loss to conceive some plan of action which would be a road to escape from his present diffi culties. Certainly his position was one which would tax all the resources of the most astute mind. He had had many irons in the fire, and so far the success of one had more than counter balanced the failure of another. But during the past year the failures had been many and the successes few and far between, so the British public were cautious about trusting their money in the hands of John Castor ; and John Castor was the first man to recognise the fact and to know that his credit was gone. He had never been popular. He had regarded with disdain the open-"], [127, "Gossip. 119 handed hospitality of his brother millionaires and he had never done anything for the promotion of sport. His ruin would be more popular than anything he had done, with everybody except certain shareholders; and these latter might prosecute him for fraud, even if they did not gain a conviction. And might they not gain a conviction? Did not juries always sympathise with shareholders ? AA'ould it not be better to leave the country before suspicion was aroused ? How much could he take away with him in hard cash ? And yet if he could only holdover till the Stanford coal mines were floated he should be richer than ever ! But the prospects of the Stanford coal mines were not good enough to raise a loan upon, and time in John Castor's case was the essence of the contract. \" Manisty, suppose by some unforeseen circumstances it tran spired that you struck the blow which killed Stone, you would stand your trial for manslaughter. Don't start ! Your secret is safe with me, but a trivial accident might bring the whole matter to light.\" \" Whatever happened it would mean ruin to me ; but don't talk of it.\" \" It is my principle to guard against contingencies, however remote they may appear to be at first sight. Now, Langton, if not clever, is what people call sharp, and if he is found ' not guilty ' of getting rid of Stone \" \"If he is found 'not guilty!' Do you think there can be any doubt of it ? \" \" No ; but I do think that after he is found ' not guilty,' he will hint that there are other people to whom Stone's disappear ance was an advantage. He hates both you and me, and if I am any judge of character, I should say that he was a good hater. Besides, on this occasion he has good cause for his hatred. It is not pleasant to be accused and to be kept in prison for another man's misadventure.\" \" I have a good mind to confess, now.\" \"And suffer penal servitude for manslaughter. If it were possible for confession to save you, the confession should have"], [128, "Society Rogues. 120 been made at the time. It is too late now, especially as you have allowed Langton to be arrested.\" \" What do you propose ? You have some scheme.\" \" I have a most important scheme.\" Castor got up and opened the door. \" One never knows when eavesdroppers may be about. Now it may happen that I shall be unable to stem the tide of financial disaster which has set against me. My daughter is provided for, as the Stanford estates are settled upon her. I have only myself to care about. Should I decide upon going abroad, will you come with me as my partner ? I shall save, and take with me out of the ruin, more than you could ever make with your pen in a hundred years. Half of this shall be yours.\" \" You forget that I am engaged to be married.\" \" To a lady who would not speak to you, if she knew of the Stone affair.\" \" It seems as if I were flying from justice.\" \" Under which circumstances it is best not to let justice over take you.\" Manisty remained in deep thought for some moments, then he asked suddenly : \" AVhen do you propose to go ? \" \" You may go as soon as you like, and I will join you as soon as I have wound up my own affairs. That will only take a few days.\" \" Give me till to-night to think it over.\" \" Very well ; but I think you have already decided.\" The above conversation had taken place, in Mr. Castor's private room at Stanford Hall, whither Manisty had come down immediately that he had heard of Langton's arrest. So far as he had been able to ascertain, there was no suspicion in regard to himself. The papers had commented strongly on the fact, that a murder had been committed in Fleet Street at an hour when it was probable that, there would be many men about connected with the press, and \"The Cheshire Cheese,\" had been thronged with a crowd of morbid visitors, till Charlie Moore had nearly been driven into a lunatic asylum. Then came the news of Langton's"], [129, "Gnssip. 121 arrest at his rooms, apparently only because he had been seen quarrelling with Stone shortly before the body was found. In vain he protested his innocence. The police had asked for a re mand and he had been remanded in custody accordingly, for the police to prosecute inquiries which it was understood would have reference to the Cosford racing scandal. This last item of news only appeared in the evening papers after the conversation between Manisty and Castor and the former at once concluded that everybody connected with the Cosford steeplechase would be subp\u0153naed and what would only have been an inquiry by the National Hunt Committee would become a matter of police court investigation. All the details would be divulged. Mrs. Delamaine would give evidence and, whatever might be the result, it was certain that a good deal of dirty linen would be washed in public. No sooner had Manisty read the news in the evening paper than he determined to return to town immediately, and communicated his resolve to John Castor. \" And your decision on the other matter ?\" \" I will leave England as soon as you like.\" \" Good ! I shall come to London the first thing in the morning. Meet me at lunch at Park Lane, at two ; I can settle everything here to-night.\" On arriving in London, Manisty drove straight to his club, eager to find out if there were any fresh details. Daley, the sporting assistant editor was in the smoking-room and beckoned to him to sit beside him. \" AVell what do you think of matters now ?\" \" I was going to ask you, for I have only just come from Stan ford, where I went directly I heard of Langton's arrest, My own opinion is that the police have been over-officious. There does not seem to me to be a tittle of evidence against Langton.\" \" But what brought Stone in AVine Office Court ? \" \" I can't say ; unless it was to see me. He and Langton had been quarrelling, and no doubt my name was mentioned. That is the worst of the whole affair, for I suppose I shall get mixed up in it,\""], [130, "Society Rogues. 122 \"Not much doubt of that, for the latest report is, that Stone was heard to say that he should call on you, and the next thing that happens is that he is found dead nearly opposite your door. You will attend the inquest to-morrow, I suppose ? \" \" I didn't know that it was fixed for to-morrow ; but I don't see any reason why I should attend.\" \" Not after the deceased had declared his intention of visiting you ? It will seem curious, to say the least of it, if you don't attend. Besides ; read this paragraph. ' No doubt Mr. Manisty will be able to throw some light upon what is now shrouded in mystery at the inquest to-morrow.' In the face of that you can hardly stay away. In fact ; if I were the coroner, I should adjourn the inquest for your attendance.\" \" AVhat an infernal nuisance ! \" \"Of course it is,\" Daley replied, drily. \"I never have been at an inquest in my life, but I should not think it was a par ticularly pleasant form of entertainment.\" Manisty had attended several in a journalistic capacity, but, cool-headed as he was, he felt that it would require all his courage to face Langton when he was brought up in custody and asked if he would elect to give evidence. Still he saw that his absence would be construed as cowardice, so he wrote to Castor explain ing, why he might not be able to keep his appointment at Park Lane, and walked home. But he shivered involuntarily as he passed that fatal step at The Cheshire Cheese. The house had not closed so he went in to hear if there was any further gossip, and was unpleasandy surprised to see that his entrance caused some sensation, while Moore beckoned him aside. \" I have had a lady visitor here to-day inquiring for you. You can guess who it was ? \" \" I might guess, but I don't know. AVho was it ? \" \"Mrs. Delamaine, the sister of Stone.\" \" H'm ! AA'hat did she want me for ?\" '\u2022 She didn't tell me that ; but she spoke of Stone as her mur dered brother.\""], [131, "Gossip. 123 '\u2022 That sounds bad for Langton. Not that I pay much attention to what she says, for 1 hear that she has been deceiving Langton for some months.\" \" AVell, I don't know ; but I don't think that her visit to you was intended as a friendly one. Shall you go the inquest ?\" \" I must after what has been said in the papers. Not that I can throw any light on the matter for I have not the slightest idea what Stone wanted to see me about. He had confessed to riding unfairly, and I thought that he had left the country.\" \" But why did he confess? and why, having confessed, should he want to bolt ? I am not curious, but they are curious at the Albert Club, and they think you will be able to solve the mystery.\" \" Then I am afraid they will be disappointed. Look here, Moore, in my opinion, and I shall not hesitate to express it publicly, there has been too much idle gossip over this matter. I do not believe that Langton ought to have been arrested, for I believe that Stone fell down and broke his skull, as many a drunken man has done before to-day. The fact of his quarrelling with Langton in his cups does not prove that there was a fight, let alone that Langton killed him. You know as well as I do, that over a fight originating over a public house quarrel there are always certain to be plenty of witnesses. However, we shall know more about it to-morrow.\" AVith these words, Manisty, outwardly bearing the assurance of a man who knew that he could clear up all doubts upon what was now called in the newspapers \"The Cheshire Cheese Mystery?\" left Charlie Moore to the enjoyment of his favourite alcoholic beverage, and retired to his own rooms. But his thoughts when he sought slumber were gloomy, and for the first time in his labo rious life, he had to seek consolation from brandy, before sleep closed his eyes."], [132, "124 CHAPTER XVIII, The Verdict. HE crowd outside the court of the City Coroner, justled their component parts as crowds always will do on occasions when any unusual excite- ment prevails. There was the Irish beldame from Clerkenwell with the everlasting baby in arms and ragged shawl on her back, who divides her hours of recreation between the Police Courts, the Coroners' Courts and the public houses, more especially the latter. There was the descendant of the Artful Dodger complaining in doleful accents to the modern Charley Bates that, \"there wasn't a cuss in the 'ole lot as 'ad a wipe worth sneaking.\" There, too, was the fifteen-year-old, ginny- faced, foul-mouthed female production of the slums of modern London ; the \"donah\" of the chief of a pistol gang, till the said chief is sent to a place where the \" cat \" is used in place of the pistol. There too, was the modern Bill Sykes, with his employer the modern Fagin. They are still amongst us, these terrors of the police and the public, excepting when some muscular citizen happens to be in their vicinity. There they were, a crowd, which a Paris mob, in the days of the Revolution, would have been ashamed to have rubbed shoulders with. Through this crowd, Howard Manisty made his way as best he could, for as an experienced journalist he knew that the police were powerless to render him any assistance. Yet the crowd instinct-"], [133, "The Verdict. i2$ ively gave way to him, as a crowd always will give way to a man of commanding presence. By some of the mob he was recog nised as being one of the leading writers upon the slums of London, and was greeted with remarks meant to be complimen tary, though the result was not in logical accordance with the intention. For the first time in his life, Manisty discovered that notoriety might be unenviable, as he elbowed his way through this mass of humanity. As Manisty entered the court, the Coroner, a little, fussy man, who shone more in social circles than he did in legal circles, was listening to the usual excuses made by unwilling jurymen, excuses which would have done credit to Ananias and Sapphira, and probably deceived Paul, whose ideas of administering justice would hardly have met with approval in these later days of the nineteenth century. Having dismissed the excuses by the very simple method of swearing the excusers, and the duly sw-orn jury having performed the formal duty of viewing the body, the examination of the witnesses commenced. Evidence was first given of identification and of the discovery of the body by the policeman. Then came the medical testimony, which was some what contradictory, for while one doctor stated that death might have been caused by a fall, another doctor said that the marks on the face, proved that the deceased had been fighting. Evidence was then given that the deceased had been intoxicated during the evening, and had been quarrelling with Langton over some racing \u25a0dispute the true nature of which the witnesses were unable to tell ; but they believed that it had reference to an incident at the Cos ford races, which had been already commented upon in the press. It was shewn that there was a rumour that Mr. Langton had been publicly accused of bribing Stone to cause a horse to lose a race, -and had been at great pains during the afternoon and evening to contradict the rumour. The deceased and Langton had first met -that day, at \"The Old Cheshire Cheese.\" \"AVas the deceased intoxicated? \" \"Yes.\" Mr. Charles Moore, who was under examination replied. \" So much so that I gave orders that h_ *as not to be"], [134, "126 Society Rogues. served, and with some difficulty I persuaded him to leave the house. He was excited and used strong language to Mr. Lang ton in regard to a racing fraud.\" \" We have heard a great deal about this racing dispute ; was it of such a serious nature as to lead to a fight ?\" \" It was of such a serious nature as to lead to an investigation by the National Hunt Committee.\" Langton having been duly cautioned by the coroner elected to give evidence. He stated that he was the victim of a plot con ceived against him by John Castor, Howard Manisty, Stone, Laura Delamaine and others, with the object of having him warned off the turf. He had been a backer of horses for some years, and had hoped to have the management of the Stanford racing stable, when Miss Castor married Harry Stanford. In this he had been disappointed and he admitted that he felt no goodwill towards the Stanford connection, but he had never dreamt of acting unfairly. The rumour that he had bribed Stone to cross Mr. Stan ford's horse \" Splendacious,\" was absolutely without foundation. John Castor feared rather than disliked him, because an accident had given him certain information in regard to John Castor's financial operations. AA'hen he heard of the rumour he took every step he could think ol to contradict it both in the press and at the sporting clubs, and had also instructed his solicitor to bring an action against Mr. Manisty. On the evening of his death he met Stone in \" The Old Cheshire Cheese.\" Stone, who was drunk at the time insulted him, so he requested Mr. Moore to have him ejected. To the best of his belief this was done, and he remained and dined at the house. After dinner he visited certain newspaper offices and also certain bars in Fleet Street and its vicinity. He believed that Stone was shadowing him for the purpose of again insulting him, as he met him at every bar into which he went, and on every occasion Stone attempted to renew the quarrel. Finally, he went home about half-past eleven and Stone said he was going to see Manisty. That was the last time that he saw the deceased. \" You are on remand now for having caused his death ?\""], [135, "The Verdict. 127 \" Yes. I was never more surprised in my life than when I heard of his death. I cannot understand now, why I was arrested.\" \" Is Mr. Manisty here ?\" Manisty immediately rose. \" Can you throw any light on this mysterious death ? Manisty was duly sworn. He knew of the rumour that Langton had bribed Stone and was surprised to hear that the two men had quarrelled. As he believed that the rumour was being inquired into by the National Hunt Committee he preferred not to give an opinion. Personally, he did not know Stone and could not conceive any reason for his wishing to visit him. Mr. Langton had threatened to bring an action against him, but he hardly knew Mr. Langton and certainly had no private animosity against him. On the evening in question he had returned home about half-past eleven and nobody had called upon him. A juryman here interposed with the pertinent question. \"AVhy should Stone want to call upcn him?\" \" I cannot tell ; but it is evident that my name was mentioned in the dispute between Stone and Langton, though in what way I cannot imagine.\" The coroner then summed up, directing the jury to find an open verdict to the effect that the deceased had met his death by a fall, but whether the fall was the result of a blow, and if so by whom given, there was no evidence to show. But juries are proverbially obstinate, and after deliberating for more than half an hour they brought in a verdict of wilful murder against Langton. The verdict caused consternation in court, and the fussy little coroner was evidently angry. But he was powerless to alter the verdict. Langton, conscious of his innocence, was stupefied. But of all the people in court nobody was more thoroughly amazed than Howard Manisty. For a moment he was on the point of making a full confession, but he remembered John Cas tor's advice that it was now too late. Yet he felt keenly all the horror of his position. Here was a man found guilty of a crime which he had committed. What would he do ? The verdict of the coroner's jury might be upheld by an Old Bailey jury. In"], [136, "Society Rogues. 128 any case, Langton would be tried for wilful murder at the Old Bailey. Recovering his ordinary self-possession, Manisty went up to Langton and held out his hand, saying in a loud tone which was audible throughout the court : \" I am convinced that you are an innocent man. If I can do anything to aid you in your defence, tell me what it is and I will do it. But in any case you may be sure that this foolish verdict will be upset.\" Langton was astonished at an offer of help from such an un expected quarter, and for a moment was irresolute whether or not to take Manisty's proffered hand. But he did take it. \" Thank you for your offer. I must make arrangements for my defence. If you will tell my solicitor to come and see me as soon as possible, I shall be obliged to you. I can only add that I am absolutely innocent.\" \" I am sure of it. I will see your solicitor, and tell him to retain the best counsel for your defence, regardless of expense. I wish that I could do more for you.\" \"I thank you; for you were the last person from whom I expected help. If I have wronged you, I am sorry for it.\" This apology was more painful to Manisty than any abuse could have been, and after Langton had been conveyed back to prison in the custody of the police, he stood for some minutes at the door of the court in a dazed condition. Then he got into a cab and was driven to Park Lane, where he related the pro ceedings to John Castor. \" I am afraid that Langton is in a fix. Of course he will be sent to trial at the Old Bailey. I suppose he will be acquitted.\" \"And if he is not acquitted, what am I to do ? \" Manisty asked. \"By that time we shall be out of British jurisdiction, and you can send a full confession to the Home Secretary together with a substantial sum of money, to compensate Langton for the incon venience he has suffered. In any case he deserves compensation, but there is no necessity to make a confession if he is acquitted. Now let us consider our own affairs. I have made arrang> ments by which I can leave England with a quarter of a million in hard"], [137, "The verdict. 129 cash. Half of this I will give to you, when I join you in the Argentine. As a token of good faith, I will give you twenty-five thousand to-night, and you can start to-morrow morning. I must wait till next week.\" \" Is it necessary that we should be so quick ? \" \" Yes. You may be accused at any moment of wilful murder, and I may be accused at any moment of fraudulent directorship. AVe must arrange all our plans to-night.\" \" And after that the deluge ! \" \" Yes ; for the shareholders who have been sufficiently foolish to trust their money in my hands.

Perhaps you do not know that I called at your rooms on the night of my brother's death?\" \" I was not aware of the fact, for I was not at home, and my servant does not live on the premises.\" \" So I imagined ; therefore I waited for you.\" Manisty started. \" You may well start, Mr. Manisty, for I saw you murder my brother. Shall I call for the police ? \" As Laura Delamaine asked the question, She took out from some hidden pocket in her dress, a small revolver. Manisty sprang at her like a panther, and nearly succeeded in seizing her wrist. But she was too quick for him ; and, in her hurry to avoid him, her finger touched the trigger.

The Rector's Impressions, HAD been Rector of Duddlestone for more than ten years, when Ralph Snowdon came to live there. Prior to his arrival, Duddlestone had not boasted of a resident doctor. But the population of the village had grown, a railway company had made Duddlestone a junction, and an hotel, a dissenting chapel, shops, and artisans' dwellings had suddenly sprung up like weeds. The place lost much of its rustic beauty ; but the income of the Earl of Duddlestone was considerably increased. Owing to these alterations, it therefore became a matter of necessity that we should have a doctor. Nobody was more anxious on this point, than Lord Duddle stone. Always careful for the welfare of his tenantry, I believe that he was in hourly dread, lest a railway accident should happen, and no medical man be at hand to give relief. Many were the conversations that we had on the matter, for the Earl was in the habit of dropping in at the Rectory, at all times. 131 1 2"], [140, "The Doctor of Duddlestone. 132 He would come through the wicket gate, which divided the garden from the park, and relieve me from the solitude of bachelorhood. His erect figure which nearly sixty years had not bent, was ever a welcome sight to me. His knowledge of men and books could not fail to be interesting to a man, who prided himself on being a scholar ; while his zest for field sports, could be appreciated by one, who failed to see why a clergyman should not enjoy sport. One morning he came into my study with an unusual look of joy on his face. \"At last, Ridley \" he began. \"I have found the man. He will be a perfect treasure to all of us.\" \" I suppose you mean the doctor.\" \" Of course ! Whom else could I mean ? AVhy he wants to bury himself down here, I can't understand, except that he is fond of hunting, fishing, and shooting, and only practises for amuse ment. However, he is coming this afternoon to stay for a few days at the Castle, so you must come to dinner this evening.\" \" AVith pleasure. But what is the name of this prodigy ? \" \" Ralph Snowdon, the man who made such a stir at Oxford eight years ago. It appears that when he took his degree, after astonishing the examiners out of their senses, he went to the East where he remained for two years. On his return he studied medicine in Edinburgh for four years, got qualified and came up to London, where he has been living for about two years, devoting all the power of his giant intellect to his new profession. Now, he is coming to shed his glory upon Duddlestone,\" \" Duddlestone ought to feel grateful, though why a man who has already won a world-wide reputation as a scholar, should come here, passes my comprehension. Lord Duddlestone remained for over an hour discussing Snowdon, the house which he would occupy, and other matters connected with his arrival. AA'hen he rose to go he said casually : \" And I forgot to tell you that my wife knows him, though she has not seen him since he left Oxford.\" I do not pretend to be a judge of female beauty, and therefore it is beyond my power to describe the appearance of Lady Duddle-"], [141, "The Rector's impressions. 133 stone. I must ask the reader to be content when I say that she was only twenty-nine years of age, or about half the age of her husband. Her manner towards strangers was haughty ; but amongst those whom she knew \u2014 especially the poor \u2014 she was cordial in the extreme. Her winning smile brought joy to many a sorrowing heart. Yet there were times when she seemed sad. She was not twenty-one when she married the Earl, and it did not seem natural that she could have loved him. But she must have been too young to have lost her heart to anybody else. I was not so enthusiastic as Lord Duddlestone about the new doctor. Ralph Snowdon, the brilliant classical scholar, did not seem the man to be satisfied with a country practice. The fact that he was independent of the emoluments of his profession might make him lax in his duties. His zeal for science, might make him anxious to experiment on my parishioners. Perhaps there was a tinge of jealousy in my forebodings, for I saw that in future the Earl's visits to my study would be less frequent. In fact, I was almost prepared to dislike Snowdon when I entered the drawing-room at the Castle before dinner. His appearance and manner however, were such as to disarm my suspicions. A lofty forehead, keen, blue eyes of unnatural brightness, and a firm mouth were united to a physique which denoted elastic activity rather than brute strength. In height he must have been over six feet, though a slight stoop deteriorated from his stature. His manner formed a strange mixture of reserve and cordiality. There were only four of us at dinner, namely, the Earl and Countess, Snowdon and myself ; but Snowdon was evidently more anxious to hear about Duddlestone than to talk about himself. It was not till after the Countess had retired that he gave us any clue as to the reason why he had adopted the medical profession. The conversation had turned upon Oriental matters, and Snowdon had been led on to talk about his own experiences in the East. \"I started for India almost immediately after I had taken my degree, for there were many reasons why I wished to leave England.\""], [142, "The Doc ter of Duddlestone. 134 \" And give up your Oxford career?\" the Earl asked paren thetically. \" Yes, and give up my Oxford career. Most people thought me foolish at the time, but I thought otherwise. I had believed that I could persuade somebody to become my helpmate through life. I was mistaken. The lady disliked the idea of becoming a scholar's wife, or she acted under the influence of her parents. It amounted to the same thing. I was a disconsolate lover, reading hard to drown trouble, when I was working for my final examination. AA'ell, the lady married, and I went to India.\" \" My wife, whom I believe you knew in your Oxford days, never told me about this. Perhaps she was not aware of it ! \" \" I do not think she was. \" Snowdon replied drily. \" Any how, the sentiment of love is now blotted out of my mind. Certain Oriental sympathies did that, and the same sympathies gave birth within me to an unquenchable desire for what is commonly called medical knowledge.\" \" AVould it be rude to ask what those sympathies were ? \" \" Not in the least. I was anxious to study Oriental philo sophy, which is twin brother to Oriental religion. Experience soon taught me that medicine was closely allied to both ; in other words, that the body and soul are so mixed up, that it is impossible to separate them.\" It was not to be expected that I, an old-fashioned clergyman, could like the turn the conversation had taken. But Snowdon seemed to ignore my presence, and continued in the same matter of-fact tone. \" Since love is a common attribute of the soul and body, I began to study the science of the body in order to destroy my former passion.\" \" And have you succeeded ? \" the Earl asked with a smile. \" I hope so. It is impossible to say, as yet.\" The Earl became most inquisitive about Oriental religion, philosophy, and medicine, so that the conversation was more scientific than interesting to the ordinary listener. I, who have no experience of the modern doctrines of mesmerism and"], [143, "Tlie Rector's impressions. 135 hypnotism was bewildered at Snowdon's revelations, and the possibilities which those revelations suggested. I did notice, how ever, that the Earl's questions were chiefly directed to the issue, as to whether love could be commanded, diminished, and abolished by the influence of occult forces, and that Snowdon did not hesitate to satisfy his curiosity. Though as a rule, it was not customary at Duddlestone Castle for the gentlemen to sit long over their wine, on this evening it was nearly ten o'clock before we rejoined the Countess in the drawing-room. \" I thought you were never going to give me the pleasure of your i o npany again,\" she said as we entered. I hurriedly made an excuse about Snowdon's fascinating conversation. May I be pardoned the lie, for I had found it far from fascinating ! \"Indeed!\" she answered with a quiver in her voice. \"You see, Doctor Snowdon it is over eight years since we met, so I had forgotten how persuasive your tongue could be.\" \" I am sorry you should have forgotten so soon,\" Snowdon rejoined, as he sank into a chair by the side of his hostess. \" Not that I flatter myself, on possessing a persuasive tongue ; on the contrary, I have good reason to know that it lacks the art of persuasion.\" Lady Duddlestone flushed angrily ; but whether at the audacity of the remark which amounted almost to rudeness, I could not tell. But she seemed nervous, as if she were afraid of meeting the gaze of her guest's blue eyes. I was surprised at this, for Lady Duddlestone's manner in society was the opposite to being nervous. It was not long before I rose to walk home. AVas it the harvest moon that gave me such a weird sensation, as I strolled across the park, or was it the recollection of the new doctor ? I know not which ; but my imagination prophesied that there was evil to come."], [144, "136 CHAPTER II. Signals of Danger. LTHOUGH our worthy friend, Mr. Ridley, has pro fessed that he is unable to describe the beauty of Lady Duddlestone, we feel it to be our duty to paint her portrait with more detail. She was one of those tall, handsome women, who seldom reach the meridian of their beauty before thirty ; women, who are the peculiar pride ol England ; women who are young at the age when the beauties of southern Europe are shedding the sere and yellow leaf. Her womanhood had not lost the graceful elasticity of youth. Though apparently, she was pale, calm and impassive, there were slum bering fires in her dark eyes which suggested infinite possibilities of love \u2014 or anger. Her profile was perfect ; yet, in her own sphere of society, she was unpopular. \" She may be beautiful, but when I look at her I feel as if some body were dropping ice down my back,\" Tom Devereux said at the Marlborough Club ; and most people agreed with the opinion, though sentimental young ladies expressed it by saying that she had no heart. But Ralph Snowdon seemed to care little about his hostess or her heart. He rode, walked, and drove with the Earl during the day, and in the evening was introduced at dinner to the county magistrates, who were pleased with him, while he was bored with them. At the end of a week he definitely decided to become the resident doctor of Duddlestone. The only thing which remained to be done was to get his house ready for his reception."], [145, "Signals of danger. 137 Like the Rectory, the back of this house overlooked the park, with the exception that the garden gate, instead of leading direct to the turf, ed to a path, which went through a small plantation of firs before coming to the open sward. Of the house itself, which appeared large for a bachelor, it is only necessary to mention one detail. A one-storied wing, which had originally been built for a billiard-room, was now being turned into a laboratory. Even the windows were bricked up, and tiny air holes sufficed for all the purposes of ventilation. Snowdon personally superintended this alteration, in which he took the deepest interest ; but the simple minded Rector viewed the laboratory with secret apprehension. Chemical science had no fascination for him ; indeed he rather re garded it as an invention of the devil, which like sorcery and the black arts ought to be put down with an iron hand. Lady Duddlestone apparently was indifferent to the existence of the new doctor. Even her husband upbraided her for her lack of cordiality ; but she only replied wearily \" Mr. Snowdon seems to be a universal favourite ; but I think he is too clever for a country doctor. I cannot understand what can be his object in settling down here.\" Yet it was impossible for Lady Duddle stone to avoid Snowdon. Perhaps the greatest pleasure she had in her life at Duddlestone, lay in acting the part of Lady Bountiful. Charity with her was not only a duty but a pleasure. Until Snowdon's arrival she had been guided entirely by the rector, but now the new doctor occasionally solicited her kindness on behalf of a sick patient. Yet he seemed to wish to avoid her, as much as she wished to avoid him. It was Snowdon's favourite amusement during the summer months to fish, or to speak accurately, to lie lazily on the bank of a stream with a rod in his hand, as an excuse for indulging in the dolce far niente. Like most men who have lived in the East, he was inclined in his idle moments to be a visionary, and his thoughts would more often dwell on \"the what might have been\" than on the silver trout. He would dream of the girl whom he had loved in his Oxford days, when he was the pride of the University, to whom he had offered his heart, for whose sake he"], [146, "138 The Doctor of Duddlestone. had looked forward to a brilliant scholastic career ending in the Mastership of Balliol College. Then would come the memory of one short and bitter interview. A rich suitor had supplanted the scholar. It was a case of intellect versus wealth and a coronet ; and intellect had been defeated. \" Bah ! AVhy do I think of it ? \" he said unconsciously aloud, one August afternoon, as he sat musing on the bank of the little river which flowed through Duddlestone Park. \" I swore at the time to have my revenge, and now when it is within my power to have it, I hesitate.\" The fluttering of a skirt roused him from his reverie, and looking round he saw- Lady Duddlestone. For a moment a bright gleam shone in his blue eyes, which might have been caused by love or hatred \u2014 or both. But he instantly recovered his self-possession, and raising his hat said calmly : \" As usual you find me poaching, though I am afraid I can not boast of much success.\" \"You know that you are welcome,\" Lady Duddlestone answered, though there was no smile of welcome on her face. \"I suppose your decision to remain at Duddlestone is irrevocable ! \" \" I suppose so. The fact that my house is ready, has robbed me of any excuse for going away.\" They stood facing each other ; but the woman was the first to lower her eyes. \" I am sorry you intend to remain. AA'hat reason can the eminent scholar, Mr. Snowdon, have for burying his genius in a place like this ? \" \" First and foremost, to be near Lady Duddlestone.\" \" This is either madness or insolence. You forget that \" \"You are no longer Norah Henley, but the Countess of Duddlestone. No; I have not forgotten the fact. At one time it was far too interesting to me to be easily forgotten.\" \" AVhy did you come here to revive the memory of the past?\" \" To see how the Countess of Duddlestone enjoyed her life.\" \" AA'hy don't you tell the truth ? Do you think that you can deceive me ? Do you think for one moment that I do not know"], [147, "Signals of danger. 139 that you hate me ? Do you think that I have forgotten your words when we parted eight years ago ? You have formed some plan for wreaking your vengeance upon a helpless woman. AVhat it is I cannot imagine, but some instinct warns me that you are my enemy.\" \" I see no necessity for this tirade. Some eight years ago you informed me, whom you had promised to marry, that you had changed your mind and were going to marry Lord Duddlestone. If society h. d known about it, society would have said that I was jilted. As it was I went abroad to hide my trouble, and society called me a fool. I got over my trouble, but opportunity throws me in the way of the lady who caused it. Que voulez-vous ? You have called me a scholar, and curiosity is the first step to scholarship. I was curious to see the Countess of Duddlestone.\" \" And to discover if she were happy in her married life ? Speak the truth ! You hoped to find her a miserable woman, and you are disappointed to find that she is happy.\" \" On the contrary, I am rejoiced to hear from her own lips that she is happy. Such being the case,\" why should I not regard her happiness at a respectful distance ? \" \" I cannot prevent you ; but \u2014 I wish you had not come.\" The last words were uttered in a low tone. Snowdon glanced quickly at the woman whom he had once loved. \"Are you happy?\" \" How dare you ask me such a question ? Do you, to whom my husband has opened his doors, dare to question me about my married life? I always thought, sir, that you were a gentleman.\" \"You need not be afraid that I shall betray your husband's hospitality, though it is impossible for me to accede to your request, and leave Duddlestone. Therefore, my lady, would it not be best that we should be friends ? \" \" On one condition, namely, that you never allude to the past.\" \"I accept your terms, willingly.\" Lady Duddlestone took the hand which he held out. Then they parted."], [148, "The Doctor of Duddlestone. 140 Ralph Snowdon watched her with a peculiar expression in his eyes, as she walked across the park to the Castle. AVhen she had passed out of sight, he collected his fishing-tackle and turned towards home. \" She is perfectly right,\" he muttered to himself. \" The world would say that I had betrayed hospitality. Yet my host deprived me of my love, and with it, of all ambition in this life. He has deprived two people of all earthly joy. He acted unconsciously ; but how could he expect a girl like Norah Henley to love him ? And how could she marry him ? \" AA'hen he reached his own house Snowdon immediately went into the laboratory. This room was now completed ; but it was a whim of the doctor's always to keep the door locked. No prying housemaid with destructive duster, was allowed within its precincts. It was the sanctum sanctorum of the scholar, and the wonder, if not the terror of his servants. The student might have been presumed to have forgotten his hopeless love in the abstraction caused by his experiments. The lines on his forehead became strongly marked as he bent over his work. That the work was attended with a certain amount of danger might be seen from the fact that he wore a glass mask to protect himself from the perfumes of subtle poisons. \" It must be so,\" he muttered to himself at length, with a sigh of relief. \" The experiment may be dangerous, but its success is possible. I will try it.\" AVe will not attempt to describe Snowdon's experiments ; indeed, we should not have mentioned them, but for the reason that they were destined to have a tremendous influence over the Earl and Countess of Duddlestone. It is only necessary to say that to the science of chemistry as known throughout Europe, Snowdon had added a certain knowledge, derived from the \"Chclas\" or high priests of Buddhism. This knowledge was confined to the properties of certain herbs, for Snowdon was not the man to worry his brains about the chimeras of any religion, but he did believe that if the body were placed under certain abnormal influences, it was possible for a second person to gain"], [149, "Signals of danger. 141 complete ascendancy over the body and mind of the person whose body had been thus placed. His doctrine differed from those of hypnotism and mesmerism, since no person except the experi mentalist, could be conscious that any occult force was being used. In spite of eight years of uninterrupted study, Snowdon was now as deeply in love with Lady Duddlestone, as he had been when she was Norah Henley. He knew it, and he knew too that she was in love with him, but he knew also, that the Countess would die in misery before she would be guilty of a single word or look which might be construed as infidelity towards her husband \u2014 if her mind were in its normal state. But we must leave Snowdon in his laboratory, and follow Lady Duddlestone to the Castle, where she sat in her own boudoir trying to review her life. At the command of an ambitious mother, she had thrown aside the love of Ralph Snowdon, for the sake of becoming a Countess. The mother did not live long after her wish was realised. In the meantime Snowdon had become an exile in the East, and had taken with him the love of Norah Henley. Honour and obedience were all that she had had to give to her husband. She fulfilled the duties of her position in a cold, mechanical manner ; but the capacity for enjoyment had departed from her mind. And now, Ralph Snowdon had come again into her life at the invitation of her husband, and the passion which she thought was dead was revived ; she blushed with shame as she confessed the truth to herself, and vowed to keep the truth a secret within her bosom, little guessing that Ralph Snowdon had already read her secret."], [150, "CHAPTER III. A New Disease with an Old Name. HE sound of wheels caused Lady Duddlestone to descend hurriedly from her boudoir to the drawing room. Several guests were expected to arrive at the Castle in the course of the afternoon, amongst them being Mr. Levantine, the famous politician and Cabinet Minister. The Earl of Duddlestone, though far from being a fluent speaker, was an ardent supporter of his political party, and considered that his mission during the autumn recess, was to attend his friend Mr. Levantine in his tour of platform speechifying throughout the country. It was one of his great disappointments that he could not persuade his wife to take any interest in what he termed \"the questions of the day.\" Lady Duddlestone listened wearily and became a Dame of the Primrose League. Then she con sidered that she had done sufficient for the cause. The dinner party this evening was more tedious than ever to her. AVhile she bent her head in recognition of the well-worn aphorisms of Conservatism, her heart and thoughts were on the bank of the stream where she had seen Snowdon in the afternoon. Only once did the conversation interest her. \" By the way, Levantine,\" said the Earl. \" I have asked our new doctor to meet you to-morrow evening. He has lived some time in the East, so may be able to give us a hint or two, as he is a very clever fellow. He is that man Snowdon who did such wonders at Oxford some few years ago.\" 142"], [151, "A new disease with an old name. 143 That man Snowdon ! Lady Duddlestone's cheeks were scarlet. \" I remember him well,\" the statesman replied. \" He is down here, is he ? Curious, how men who give such promise in their youth should dwindle into obscurity in later life. A disappointment in love, a wrong step in the choice of a profession, or some such accident, is sufficient to blight what might have been a brilliant career.\" Mr. Levantine had the reputation of being a keen debater, but seldom before had his words struck home so sharply as they did now into the bosom of his hostess. Her heart seemed to stop beating, and it was only by a supreme effort of the will, that she saved herself from fainting. But her trials were not over. AA'hile the gentlemen were sit ting over their wine, the ladies in the drawing-room could do nothing but talk about the new doctor, and pester their hostess with questions about him, every one of which was like a dagger in her breast. AA'hen at last she gained the privacy of her own room she hurriedly dismissed her maid, and fell weeping on to her bed. She was still in the same position when the Earl entered. \" AVhat, Norah ! Not in bed, and crying ! AVhat is the matter, darling ? \" She dried her eyes hastily. \" I am very silly. It was only slight hysteria. I shall be quite well in the morning.\" \"Nerves out of order, little one, I expect. I will send over for Snowdon the first thing after breakfast. You want a tonic ; then you'll be all right again.\" She shuddered at the thought that her lover should become her doctor ; but she dare not say a word. She had kept her first love a secret from her husband. It was too late now to confess that she had loved another when she married him. Lady Duddlestone was too unwell to be able to appear at the breakfast table on the following morning, so the Earl sent a note to Snowdon asking him to call at once, as his wife was suffering from weak nerves."], [152, "The Doctor of Duddlestone. 144 \" Tell his lordship I will be at the Castle within a few minutes after you,\" the doctor said, as he rang the bell to order his dog-cart. The groom touched his hat, or rather the place where his hat ought to have been and withdrew, while Snowdon, instead of going to his surgery, went to his laboratory. \"I cannot afford to lose the opportunity,\" he muttered, as he carefully filled a small phial. In another five minutes he was driving to the castle. He was ushered immediately into the boudoir, where Lady Duddlestone wrapped in a loose peignoir was reclining on the sofa. The Earl was in a chair beside her, having sacrificed the duties of hospitality to his anxiety for his wife. For one second, as he took in the situation at a glance, there was a contemptuous curve on Snowdon's lower lip ; then with that strange mixture of con dolence, sympathy, and hope, which constitutes the professional manner of the medical man, he approached the sofa. A very few minutes were sufficient for him in which to make his diagnosis. \" Nerves slightly unstrung, and heart not quite as strong as it might be; I must see you take this tonic which I brought with me, and I will send you up something else as soc as I get home. I should advise you to keep quiet and rest till the evening. By dinner-time, I trust you will feel as strong as ever.\" The Earl followed Snowdon when he left the boudoir, and pass ing his arm through that of the doctor said anxiously : \"There is nothing serious the matter?\" \" No, my lord ; I think not. But she has been excited lately, and calm temperaments feel the effect of excitement all the more because they lie hidden beneath impassive exteriors.\" \" But I know of nothing which could have excited Lady Dud dlestone.\" \" Not even politics ?\" \" I should say they were the last thing to excite her. As you know, I have promised to accompany Levantine on his political tour, when of course Lady Duddlestone will come with me. But she doesn't appear to take the slightest interest in the matter.\""], [153, "A new disease with an old name. 145 \" In other words, she does not want to accompany you, and yet she is afraid of offending you by refusing to do so. Many ladies shrink from the publicity of a political platform. If this be really the cause of her ladyship's indisposition \u2014 for I will not call it illness at present \u2014 I should advise you not to insist upon her joining you.\" The Earl frowned. \"I will speak to her about it,\" he said shortly. \" Please do not do so to-day, it would probably increase her nervous debility.\" \" Very well ! Doctors must be obeyed I suppose, but it's most unfortunate.\" \" I will send up the medicine immediately,\" Snowdon said, disregarding the Earl's remark. \" There is no need for alarm I assure you. Good-morning ! \" Again Ralph Snowdon went to his laboratory and not to his surgery to prepare the medicine which he sent up to the Castle. The experiment once begun must be carried through to the sweet, or bitter end. \" I must find out to-night,\" he said to himself, \"how long this home party will remain at the Castle, and when Levantine and the Earl start to fulfil their political programme. Norah must not and shall not go w-ith them. My victory will be complete ; the victory of love and intellect arrayed against wealth and power. The world may say what it likes ; but there are other countries besides England. Yes, Norah, you shall yet be mine ! \" Unlike the majority of students, Ralph Snowdon was a man eminently calculated to shine in society. He was a witty raconteur without monopolising the conversation, and he had a melodious voice which gave a charm to words which often his listeners could not understand. He had an innate knowledge of men and women which told him when to use the plausibility of the Jesuit or when to resort to the logical arguments of an Attorney General. At a dinner where the men were, and the ladies pre tended to be engrossed in politics, Ralph Snowdon was one of the few men who could expel the dull stagnation generally inse parable from such gatherings."], [154, "The Doctor of Duddlestone. 146 Such at least was the case on the night when he met Levantine, who felt somewhat annoyed at being eclipsed by the young doctor. Yet Snowdon made no parade of his brilliant gifts. His wit seemed to flow naturally without an effort. It was the first occasion on which Lord Duddlestone had seen him amongst those people who are commonly termed \" the upper ten thousand,\" and he was more astonished than pleased to see how he established himself as a leader amongst them. AVhat would his feelings have been, if he had known the ulterior motive of his brilliancy ? In order to gain complete mastery over Lady Duddlestone, it was Snowdon's policy to win her admiration. She must acknow ledge his superiority to her husband and her husband's circle of acquaintances. She must feel that life without him would be a void. He could already trace the effects of his medicine in the sparkle of her eyes. He could see that she hung on every word that he uttered. His only fear was lest suspicion might be aroused. Nor was the fear groundless. Mr. Ridley who was one of the party, found himself compelled to act the part of listener and looker-on. As we have already seen, the clergyman had dis trusted Snowdon at their first meeting, and time had increased the distrust. He felt that a barrier had arisen between Lady Duddlestone and himself, and he chose to think that Snowdon had caused it. Therefore, on this evening he watched his hostess carefully. But the simple-minded Rector was no match for the Doctor. Snowdon having discovered that the house party would last a week, at the end of which time the Earl would start with Levantine on their political crusade, walked home across the park with Mr. Ridley. \" I have seldom seen Lady Duddlestone so gay as she was this evening. The prospect of this political campaign seems to have enlivened her.\" \" Do you think so ? \" Snowdon replied drily. \" Yet I doubt whether she will be well enough to go with the Earl. I was summoned to her this morning and had to recommend perfect test. Her first appearance was at dinner.\""], [155, "A new disease with an old name. 147 \"You surprise me. I did not know she had been unwell. I never knew her to have a day's sickness in my life.\" \" Probably so. Yet, she suffers from what is commonly called nervous derangement ; a name which covers a multitude of diseases.\" \" But you would not advise her to stay alone at the Castle, while the Earl is travelling with Mr. Levantine ! She would be moped to death.\" Snowdon turned away his head to conceal a smile. \"I don't agree with you,\" he said. \"Still a doctor can only advise ; he cannot insist upon his advice being acted upon.\" He then wished the Rector \"good-night,\" and turned into the plantation which lay outside his garden wall. During the following week Snowdon visited Lady Duddlestone every morning. He advised her not to mingle writh her guests before the dinner hour, so she passed the day in her boudoir in a state of dreamy indolence. Not only did she absolutely refuse to accompany her husband and Levantine, but she evinced a repug nance to the Earl's presence, when he came to her room. On two occasions did she send for Snowdon in the afternoon, though she had seen him in the morning, and on both these occasions she knew that her husband was engaged, so that she would have to see him alone. Lord Duddlestone was deeply distressed about his wife's illness. More than once he suggested that she should see a London specialist, but Snowdon assured him that she was only suffering from slight nervous derangement, and that perfect quiet was the best medicine that she could have. So at the end of the week, the house party at the Castle broke up, and Lord Duddlestone departed with Mr. Levantine without his wife. K 2"], [156, "CHAPTER IV. An Interruption. R. LEVANTINE was as much annoyed as Lord Duddlestone, at the refusal of the Countess to take part in his political campaign. He knew the value of her presence on a- platform, and felt that he had been outwitted at the last moment. He was especially angry with Snowdon, and did not hesitate to express his opinion about him to the Earl. \" It's stuff and nonsense to talk about nervous derangement. He has persuaded her ladyship that she is ill. It would have done her more good to have come with us, than to mope at home.\" \" I'm inclined to agree with you. Still, if one employs a doctor one must follow his advice.\" Mr. Levantine shrugged his shoulders disdainfully. A young wife, an old husband, and a good-looking doctor, he thought to himself, present a combination which is likely to breed mischief. But then he had always disliked Lord Duddlestone's marriage. If he wanted to marry, he should have married one of the many ladies, who were a political power in the land, and not a young girl like Norah Henley, whose only merit consisted in her good looks. The marriage in his opinion was an act of superlative folly, but he was far too wise to meddle in the private family affairs of any of his friends. Snowdon's attitude towards Lad)- Duddlestone underwent a 14 _"], [157, "An interruption. 149 remarkable change immediately after the departure of the Earl. He became the friend, as well as the doctor. But, while he made her feel his influence, he did not attempt to act the part of a lover. As there is a divinity that doth hedge a king, so there is a troop of spying servants that doth hedge a countess; yet whatever might have been the designs and feelings of Snowdon at this period, it was subsequently stated, that no breath of suspicion was ever whispered in the servants' hall about his relations with Lady Duddlestone. Nor was a word of scandal uttered in the village. But Snowdon was aware that the time was quickly approach ing when the Countess must resign herself entirely into his hands ; when she would have to give up wealth, power, and honour, for his sake. The effects of his Eastern medicines were pronounced. Lady Duddlestone was no longer responsible for her actions. She went through the routine of her daily life without exciting com ment, yet her most trivial action was governed by Snowdon's will. So great was the magnetic force of his mind, that even her letters to her husband seemed to be inspired by him. Snowdon was surprised at an influence which was almost miraculous. His suc cess was greater than the firmest believer in Esoteric Buddhism could have dared to anticipate, for while scientists concede that a mind or spirit may obtain unlimited influence over a kindred mind or spirit either for good or for evil, yet they consider that uninterrupted intercourse is essential to that influence. Now Snowdon was in Lady Duddlestone's society only for two or three hours during the day. But the political zeal which had caused the Earl to accompany Levantine was destined to force him to return to Duddlestone within ten days after his departure. The member for the division of the county in which Duddlestone was situated was seized with an apoplectic stroke and died immediately, so that there would have to be a fresh election, which in public opinion was sure to be hardly fought. The Earl returned to use his influence in his own county at an hour's notice and on his way from the station met Snowdon in the park who had just paid his professional visit to Lady Duddlestone."], [158, "The Doctor of Duddlestone. 150 \" We must all work hard,\" said the Earl excitedly. \" Though our candidate is a clever speaker he is a comparatively new man. I expect you know him for he must have been at Oxford in your time.\" \"What is his name?\" \" Egmont. He will commence his canvass in a day or so. I must be off now. Can you dine with me to-night ?\" Snowdon accepted the invitation, and the two men parted. The doctor hurried home in a frenzy of rage. Egmont had not only been his intimate college friend, but had been the man who had introduced him to Norah Henley and of course knew everything about the crooked course of his love. The most casual remark or the most trivial accident might reveal to the Earl that he had at one time been his wife's lover. \" Egmont would not willingly betray my secret,\" he muttered to himself as he sat down in his library chair to think over the course of events ; \" But then his wife knows it as well. She used to be a great friend of Norah's, and she rather disliked me. In fact, I suspect that she was in the plot to make Norah throw me over. Therefore she is not likely to be my friend now ; on the contrary, she will be most mischievously inquisitive and worry Egmont with her ideas of honour. In any case I must for a time put an end to my influence over Norah. AVell ! Forewarned is forearmed ! I must get some fresh air and clear my brain.\" He passed through the wicket gate into the plantation of firs, which has been already alluded to. \" If I could but see her !\" was the wish he expressed half aloud. His wish was immediately gratified. Turning a bend in the narrow path, he stood face to face before Lady Duddlestone. \" You have heard the news, what are we to do? \" She spoke like a woman who was either walking in her sleep, or under the influence of a strong narcotic. Even Snowdon was alarmed at the abnormal state of her mind and physical weakness. She was so pale, that instinctively he placed his arm round her to support her ; she made no resistance, but nestled closely to him, and let her head recline upon his shoulder; she felt his burning"], [159, "An interruption. 151 kisses upon her brow and upon her lips, and with her arms clasped round his neck ardently returned his caresses. In a brief moment of insanity, Lady Duddlestone had broken down the barrier which divides love from friendship. There could be no further pretence ; they might deceive others, but they could no longer deceive themselves. \" You have heard the news, what are we to do ? \" \"AVe must conceal our love till after this hateful election, darling, if you can do so ; then we can fly to some land where we are not known, where we can bask in the sunshine of our love, and make up for the misery of the past, by the happiness of the suture.\" \" Oh Ralph, it's dreadfully wicked.\" \" AVicked ! AVhy ? My darling, my love for you has never changed, and I believe your love for me has always been as strong as ever. It was not your own heart, but other people's persuasive tongues which made you give me up, they tried to rob me of your heart, and they have failed and must pay the penalty for their failure.\" In justice to Snowdon it ought to be said that this really was the view in which he regarded his love. On the principle of \"an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,\" he considered that since Lord Duddlestone had robbed him of his bride, he was perfectly justified in robbing him of his wife, and that the worldly harm he was doing towards Lady Duddlestone would be compensated for by her future happiness. Lord Duddlestone had certainly, if unwittingly, deprived him of a brilliant career, therefore if his conduct hardly admits of any defence, it is at least entitled to some excuse. AVhen Lady Duddlestone returned to the castle, she had consented to elope with her lover after the forthcoming election ; but in the meantime it was necessary to prevent any suspicion on the part of the Egmonts. This, as Snowdon knew, would be a difficult task. But he commenced his task the same evening, during dinner. Knowing that Egmont and his wife would arrive on the following"], [160, "The Doctor of Duddlestone. 152 day he talked much about his intimacy with them, and did not conceal the fact that it was Egmont who had first introduced him to Lady Duddlestone. The latter too, played her part well. \" Mrs. Egmont stayed here before she was married. Don't you remember an Agnes Despard ? \" she said, appealing to her husband. \" Certainly. So she married Egmont, eh ? She struck me as being a very clever girl ; just the sort of woman to make a useful wife to a rising politician. She'll help us to get him in, and lend you some of her enthusiasm as well, Norah. Luckily, we shall have the services of the agent of the late member ; still, we must all put our shoulders to the wheel.\" To the Earl a spirited election contest in his own county was the greatest joy that life could contain. So far as he was concerned, Snowdon had nothing to fear. On the contrary, his political zeal would serve to estrange him yet further from his wife, who could barely conceal her yawns at the dinner-table, and whose indifference was palpable even to her own servants. Egmont and his wife arrived the next day, and in the afternoon the candidate walked across the park to visit his old friend. \" My dear fellow, I heard you had taken to medicine ; but I had no idea I should find you down here. Still a bachelor; I'm told ? \" \" Yes ; love with me is buried and forgotten ; otherwise I should not be here.\" \"H'm,\" Egmont rejoined doubtfully. \"Lady Duddlestone hasn't altered much, at any rate. By the way, what sort of a fellow is my host ? My wife describes him as un grand seigneur.\" \" He'll bore you, of course. Old gentlemen of his stamp are always more or less wearisome, But then you must not mind being bored if you go in for politics. Otherwise, he is a good sportsman, and a popular landlord.\" \" And a uxorious husband, eh ? \" \" How can I tell ? You forget what a short time I have been here. Still, I don't think that her ladyship would consent to be an old man's darling.\""], [161, "An interruption. 153 \"No, it would hardly be her forte,\" Egmont said thoughtfully, \"I presume she takes an interest in politics.\" \" I really don't know, but I should fancy not; if I were in her place I should get heartily sick of them. Don't think me rude, old man, but it's possible to be surfeited with a good thing.\" \" Of course ; though I want to enlist you as one of my supporters.\" \"Oh, I'll support you for the sake of old times, on the con dition that you will not inflict politics upon me when we're alone and don't ask me to poison any of your opponents.\" \" That part of the bargain is settled then. I shall come to you when I get tired of the free and independent elector.\" But in spite of their friendly conversation, Snowdon was aware that it was extremely difficult to deceive Egmont, whose suspicions were already aroused. As he shook hands at parting, he said casually : \" By the way, the Earl does not know that there was ever anything more than friendship between her ladyship and myself; perhaps after all there wasn't. At all events, no good can come from talking about an old mistake. In fact, Lady Duddlestone and I have tacitly agreed to forget our youthful folly. Comprenez vous mon ami ? \" \"Certainly.\" Egmont spoke the truth ; he comprehended the matter perfectly. \" It has nothing to do with us,\" he said to his wife later on. \" If Norah Henley married for position, she is not likely after eight years, to do anything to risk it. Pshaw ! the thing would be too ridiculous ! The beautiful Countess of Duddlestone in love with a village doctor ! you might as well accuse her of being in love with her groom.\" \" Oh, you men think you know everything, Arthur. How would you like me to have one of my former lovers for my doctor? I consider Norah is behaving very foolishly.\" \" Then don't tell her so. Now for dinner and politics.\""], [162, "CHAPTER V. Flight. NOAVDON was chiefly anxious now about Lady Duddlestone's health. He knew that it would be dangerous in the extreme for her suddenly to leave off taking the medicine which he had prepared from Eastern herbs, and which had caused her will to be subjugated by his. The effect of such a sudden abstinence would be to do her harm both phy sically and mentally. On the other hand if she were to continue to take it, it would be impossible to conceal the influence which he held over her. Unfortunately, he knew of no antidote to the sub tle drugs which he had been using. He had set certain forces in motion and recognized, when too late, that he was powerless to stop them. He had forgotten that the Buddhist priests whom he had seen to put these forces in motion wished to retain, not to destroy their influence. He was now brought face to face with the anatomical relations between the brain and the rest of the body under certain abnormal conditions of his own creation. Science was of no use to him, since there was no record of any previous experience. He must do one of three things. He could elope with Lady Duddlestone immediately. He could con tinue to supply her with the same drugs and run the risk of detection. Or, finally, he could take measures to destroy the influence which he had gained, which might prove fatal to his patient. He sat up late into the night trying to consider what J54"], [163, "Flight. 155 course of conduct he should pursue. The last course he rejected decisively, since he could not foresee what danger it might bring to the woman whom he loved. Perhaps he exaggerated the possible danger because he was unwilling to lose his influence and the love which it had engendered. Besides, had not this woman whom he loved confessed her passion for him only on the previous day ? He would have been more than human if he could have abandoned all hopes of future happiness. To an immediate elopement there were many objections ; but strange as it may seem, the one which had most weight with him was the harm which it would cause to his old friend, Egmont. Of his own con venience or inconvenience he thought nothing. His only act of selfishness was the premeditated sacrifice of a woman's reputation, but he excused this act because he believed that the sacrifice was necessary for her happiness. Yet the cleverest man of the world could not have foreseen more clearly than he did that Lady Duddlestone would incur far more odium if she left her husband in the midst of his political labours than if she left him after they were finished. The scandal would be known throughout the length and breadth of the land. It would be made the subject of political gibes, and discussed in public houses by horny-handed electors. To the refined mind of the scholar this was intolerable. But if a crisis should take place during this hateful election, what would be the result ? Suppose that he was no longer able to control the will which he had subdued, and that Lady Duddlestone became unable to conceal her passion ! The slight est incident might cause detection. One word of reproach from Mrs. Egmont would cause a revelation of the truth. He swore that if such a revelation should occur, it should be followed by the instant flight of Lady Duddlestone and himself. Having determined upon his decision, he began to make every preparation for departure at a moment's notice. He wrote to his London bankers to send him a large sum of ready money. He gave instructions to his lawyer, that in the event of his being suddenly called abroad, he was to take care of his books and other personal property which he carefully enumerated. He"], [164, "The Doctor of Duddlestone. 156 destroyed certain poisons which he had in his laboratory. He put all his important private papers in his \" dispatch \" case, and packed a portmanteau so as to be in readiness for any emer gency. He even wrote a letter to the Earl to explain, though not to excuse, his conduct. Then, though the autumn dawn was changing into daylight, he wrote out a synopsis of his treatment of the various patients under his charge. He did not forget the meanest workhouse pauper. So deliberate was his method of preparation. At last when all was finished, and the birds were already carolling their matins, he passed through the garden into the park to cool his feverish brain. The work of the night had been long and hard ; but as he walked quickly over the dewy turf and felt the cool morning breeze upon his brow, the keenest observer could not have detected the slightest sign of fatigue in his bright eye and elastic figure. Certainly the simple-minded rector, Mr. Ridley, would have been thought the last man capable of reading the scholar's thoughts. Yet to him chance had allotted the task. An anti pathy had sprung up between the clergyman and the doctor at their first meeting, and subsequent intercourse had rather increased than diminished the mutual feelings of distrust. It has been stated by certain impassioned pens, about the authority of which there is no doubt, that the atmosphere of an early autumn morning is most congenial to love. AVithout con tradicting this statement, it may be stated most emphatically that the presence of Mr. Ridley was most uncongenial to Snowdon. The unusual hour prevented a curt \" Good morning \" so Snowdon was fosced into a conversation which he inwardly detested. \" AA'e're early risers, Mr. Ridley. The fresh morning air is the best antidote to the atmosphere of the sick room, and these early walks are my best medicine. But you, my dear Mr. Ridley, never need any medicine.\" \" No, Doctor ! Providence is very good to my health ; but this election makes us old clergymen oil our wheels. I hear that Mr. Egmont is an old friend of yours ? \""], [165, "Flight. 157 \" Yes ; we were at Oxford together.\" \"So he told me. I met him last night at dinner at the castle. His wife seems a very charming woman. I hope she will do Lady Duddlestone good, for lately I have thought her very low-spirited.\" \" You forget that she has been far from well. I only hope she won't overstrain her strength. I must ask Egmont not to ask her to work too hard ; for, if the Earl had his own way, she would go canvassing all over the country.\" \" You don't believe in lady politicians ? \" Snowdon shrugged his shoulders. \" I don't disbelieve in them at any rate. A woman like Mrs. Egmont might do a world of good for her husband, if she sympathised with his views, but that is no reason why Lady Duddlestone should make herself ill by trying to help a compara tive stranger to get into the House of Commons. As an old friend, you would be doing her an immense service if you were to give the Earl a hint that this political work is not good for her health. I might offend him if I were to use the privilege of a doctor, and to insist that she should not be worried about politics. I can only speak to Egmont on the subject. But the Earl would be guided by your advice.\" \" Certainly I will speak to him, if you really think that it is necessary.\" \" I do think that it is necessary,\" Snowdon replied em phatically, as he inwardly smiled at the idea of making the Rector his innocent accomplice. \" Then I will speak to him this morning, for I promised to be with him at eleven o'clock to discuss our campaign.\" \"Indeed! If you'll allow me, I will drive you up to the castle, for eleven is my hour for seeing Lady Duddlestone. I can then endorse what you say, should the Earl speak to me about it.\" The Rector accepted the offer, though when he parted from his companion, he felt annoyed with himself for having under taken a thankless office. He knew that the Earl would be ex ceedingly angry, and he dreaded the first explosion of his wrath."], [166, "158 The Doctor of Duddlestone. Nor was the Rector mistaken. At first the Earl was furious. He accused Snowdon of being a Radical, and declared that he had concocted this story about Lady Duddlestone's illness, so as to prevent her using her influence. Fortunately, Snowdon was in Lady Duddlestone's boudoir at the time, and Egmont was the only other witness of the scene. The candidate did his best to appease the anger of his chief supporter. He assured him that Snowdon had promised to work on his behalf, and that he should never forgive himself if Lady Duddlestone suffered a moment's illness on his account. Thus Egmont, as well as the Rector, became the innocent accomplice of Snowdon. The Earl was comparatively calm when the doctor entered the library. More in sorrow than in anger, though with unusual sternness, he asked : \" Is it true that you have commissioned Mr. Ridley to tell me that it is not safe for Lady Duddlestone tc help Mr. Egmont in his contest ? \" \" I hardly went as far as that, my Lord ; but I do think it would be extremely injudicious for her ladyship to be excited in her present state of health. She should be kept as quiet as possible.\" \" It comes to the same thing. My wife may not help me in my work,\" the Earl replied bitterly. \" The excitement of an election would be most prejudicial to her health. To what extent it is impossible for me to say.\" \"Then she must leave the castle, for I am determined that my house shall be Mr. Egmont's headquarters. Don't interrupt me, Egmont, though I thank you for your motives. I am as much interested in this election as you can be. I presume Lady Dud dlestone is sufficiently strong to be able to travel ?\" \"Yes,\" replied Snowdon, \"provided the journey is not very long or tedious.\" \" Then the matter is settled. I will let you know, Snowdon, where she decides to go, so that you can write to the local doctor. Do you advise any particular climate ?\" This sudden resolution on the part of the Earl was a surprise"], [167, "Flight. 159 to Snowdon and for the moment he did not know how to act. But the unforeseen question required a quick answer. \"If it could be managed, I should recommend a yachting cruise in the Mediterranean. A warm and yet a bracing air is what her ladyship wants more than anything else.\" \" Of course it can be managed. My yacht is at Southampton and can be got ready within two or three days. Lady Duddle stone has only to ask her guests and form her party.\" \" Of which I will be one \" muttered Snowdon to himself ; then he added aloud, \" Should Lady Duddlestone fancy the yachting will do her good, I will put up a small chest of medicines with instructions, unless she takes a doctor with her.\" The Earl nodded, and went upstairs to see his wife. Egmont threw himself into an arm-chair. \" Well, Snowdon, you have placed me in the most unpleasant situation that I have ever been in in my life. I feel as if I were turning my hostess out of her own house. Are things really as bad as you say ? \" \" If anything, worse. A nervous temperament combined with feeble action of the heart is not a complaint to be treated lightly. Good-bye for the present.\" The Earl found his wife more cold and impassive than usual. She said that it was a matter of indifference to her where she went so long as she left a house which was being turned into a political bear-garden. She even confessed that she disliked Egmont and his wife. Her haughty contempt towards her hus band chilled his heart, though not a word of reproach passed from his lips. He had long known that she did not love him as a wife should love her husband, but he had thought she was an affectionate companion. Now, she took no trouble to conceal her indifference, and even expressed her anxiety to leave him. Still he had no suspicion that she loved another, and that beneath her listless face her brain was meditating infidelity to him. If Snowdon had known the Earl's grief, he might have stayed his hand at the last moment before completing his vengeance. But it was not to be. Defiant of the woild's opinion, heedless of"], [168, "The Doctor of Duddlestone. 160 her husband's misery, maddened with her passionate love for Snowdon, and determined to sacrifice honour, wealth and position for his sake, utterly reckless of the future, Lady Duddlestone cast the die which forged her ruin on the afternoon after her conver sation with her husband. She met her lover in the fir plantation behind his house, and throwing herself into his arms begged him to take her away immediately. There was plenty of time for them to catch the five o'clock express to London. Telling Lady Duddlestone to stay in the waiting-room till the train came in, Snowdon sent his luggage to the station and posted the letter which he had written to the Earl. AVithin half an hour the fugitives were being whirled towrrds the metropolis. So Lady Duddlestone left her husband's roof."], [169, "CHAPTER VI, Pursued, ADY DUDDLESTONE'S absence from her drawing- room at afternoon tea excited little comment. She had told her maid that she had a headache and was going for a walk in the park. The Earl was annoyed at what seemed an act of rudeness towards Mrs. Egmont, and apologised to her for his wife's absence. But when the dinner hour approached, his annoyance changed to anxiety. Had she been attacked and robbed? or worse still, had she in a moment of frenzy committed suicide ? were questions which occurred to his mind. But he did not remain long in doubt. One of the men-servants who had been in Duddlestone, had seen the station master, from whom he had heard that her ladyship had gone to London by the five o'clock express, and that Doctor Snowdon had gone with her. At first the Earl refused to believe the news, but at Egmont's suggestion, agreed to go to Snowdon's house and to the station, when the truth was made apparent. The miserable man would have fallen had it not been for the support of Egmont's arm. AVhen he was able to speak, his first words showed the innate chivalry of his character. \" She is not guilty, Egmont. AVe had a difference this morn ing, and she has gone to her friends in London. AVe shall hear in the morning.\" But the Earl could not deceive himself, though he tried to 161 L"], [170, "The Doctor of Duddlestone. 162 deceive others. He thought that his wife had feigned illness so that she might enjoy the society of her lover. He had long known that there could be no romantic passion between his wife and himself, but he had never dreamt that she would drag his name through the mire of scandal. Yet such was the wretched end of his married life. Sorrow for her and a deep shame for the disgrace she had brought upon him were the two causes for the Earl's grief. He gave utterance to no explosion of anger against Snowdon, though if he had met him he would probably have attempted to kill him. But now there was no room for hatred in his mind. AA'hen he reached the castle, he went to his private room and refused to see anybody or to take any food. Mrs. Egmont must be excused if she could not refrain from expressing to her husband some slight satisfaction at the truth of her prophecy ; but for once in his life he snubbed her unmercifully. \"Of course we must leave here the first thing in the morning and take up our quarters at the hotel. I don't know what Dud dlestone means to do, but one thing he won't do will be to take any part in this election. Confound it all, Agnes, I believe if it had not been for us this would not have happened. Apparently she had set her face against politics and refused to take any interest in them. Duddlestone told me they had a quarrel about the matter, and he suggested that she should leave here during the contest. The lady doubtless thought that he preferred poli tics to her, works herself up into a passion, and finally runs away with her former lover, with whom she must have been on pretty intimate terms.\" \" Nonsense ! There is no excuse for either of them. Of course we must leave in the morning, but I don't see that we are to blame for what has happened. AVe have got mixed up in a horrid scandal through Norah and your old friend Ralph Snowdon, whom I always did dislike.\" \" Well ! wait till we know the end of the scandal. It may be hushed up yet. Anyhow, no good can come from talking about it.'' Lord Duddlestone had no sleep that night. Every trivial in-"], [171, "Pursued. 163 cident in his married life presented itself before his mental vision, and he could find nothing with which to reproach himself. He had indulged his wife in every passing whim. He had loaded her with jewellery and other presents. The nearest approach to a quarrel had been the few words which bad passed between them over the election. Her cold manner towards all with whom she came in contact in society, had made him think that warm affec tion was foreign to her nature. He remembered that even during their short courtship, she had accepted his attentions in a distant passionless way ; but her mother had told him that she had always been reserved from a child. And yet she had suddenly given up husband, home and honour, for the sake of an acquaint ance of a few weeks ! Then it flashed across his mind that she had known Snowdon in former days. Had not Snowdon told him satirically on the first evening of his arrival at Duddlestone that a disap .ointment in love was the reason for his going to the East ? AVas Norah the girl who had disappointed him ? There is a certain loftiness of mind which a sneering world is apt to call quixotic. All honour to the Earl for being a modern Don Quixote ! For, as he asked himself these questions and answered them in the affirmative, he placed his hands to his fore head and confessed with a groan that it was he who had been the wrongdoer. He had bought his wife in the matrimonial market of English society as completely as did ever a Turkish Pasha buy a Circassian slave in the markets of Constantinople. He had taken her from the arms of the man who loved her, and whom perhaps she loved. AA'as this true ? In the morning he would discover the truth. Egmont would be able to tell him. But true or false, how should ha act ? AVould he by any means be able to avert a public scandal ? His dread was the notoriety of divorce. Yet how could he prevent it, unless his wife returned to him craving forgiveness ? But this alternative gave him little hope. His wife would rather die in the streets than beg for his bounty. Henceforth his life must be a blank. Neither on poli tical platforms nor in clubland would he dare to show his face. L 2"], [172, "The Doctor of Duddlestone. 164 He would go abroad, and spend the remaining years of his life in obscurity. But the morning brought other thoughts. With the early post came Snowdon's letter. As might be expected from the writer, it was a masterpiece of epistolary style, but a calm inso lence pervaded every sentence which exasperated the Earl to frenzy. He was taunted with having bought a wife from a wordly-minded, mercenary mother, knowing full well that a girl, who was young enough to be his daughter, could never love him as her husband. If, however, he had hoped for such an impossibility, her behaviour during the engagement must have undeceived him. The writer gave him credit for not knowing that she was already engaged to another ; but added sarcastically, that he had never taken the trouble to inquire. \" I came down to Duddlestone,\" Snowdon continued, \" to see for myself whether Norah was happy. I found her miserable, though she was too proud to betray her misery to the world. My love for her was as strong as ever, and I knew that I was still loved in return. It was not likely that I, whom you had un wittingly cheated out of my bride by your wealth and position, should have the slightest consideration for you, nor now do I offer you any apology. All the worldly advantages which you could give had failed to make Norah happy, so I determined that her life should no longer be sacrificed to the whims of a sexagenarian. By the time you receive this, her happiness will be in my custody. I enclose the address of my solicitors. \" I am, my Lord, yours obediently, \" Ralph Snowdon.\" Such was the reward the Earl had for a night of agony, the reward for thoughts in which his wife's happiness held the first place. He rang the bell angrily, and told the servant to ask Mr. Egmont if he could see him for a few moments in private. In a few moments Egmont entered the room, and the Earl motioned him to a seat in silence. \" Mr. Egmont, as you were a witness to the unhappy incident which took place yesterday, may I ask you if you were aware that"], [173, "Pursued. 165 there had ever been any love passages \u2014 that is the correct expression I believe \u2014 between Lady Duddlestone and Doctor Snowdon ? \" \" Yes, my lord.

Then I suppose you and all your friends believe that I was the scoundrel who robbed Snowdon of his bride, and blasted his prospects in life ? \" \" No. The belief of my friends and myself was that Lady Duddlestone's mother forced her to give up Snowdon and to marry you. You asked me a straight question, my lord. For give me if I have given a straight answer.\" The Earl, who had been striding up and down the room, stopped suddenly opposite to Egmont. \" I beg your pardon ; but you must make some excuse for an old man in my position. You were, I believe, Snowdon's intimate friend. Tell me what you think of his letter ? \" Egmont read the letter carefully. \" Shall I tell you the truth my lord ? \" \" Of course. I don't want to hear empty platitudes.\" \" Snowdon will never let you see Lady Duddlestone again. I am deeply, very deeply, sorry for you, but I cannot advise you, for I am afraid it is too late for any advice to be of use.\" \" I thank you. I must go to London this morning, so I must ask you to excuse me. But in my absence, pray consider this house your own. If you will grant me a favour, let it be known that I have been called away suddenly on urgent business. Thank you again.\" The Earl held out his hand ; but the interview had over powered him. He fell back on the sofa, and sobbed like a child. For a moment Egmont was embarrassed at the sight of this strong man in tears. Then his knowledge of the world came to his service, coupled with that sympathy which is the hall-mark of the true gentleman."], [174, "166 The Doctor of Duddlestone. \" Don't lose courage, my lord, things may not be as- bad as they seem. If you really mean to go to London, I will come with you. Snowdon will listen to me. Perhaps after all, good may come out of evil. Now, do you feel fit to travel? \" \" Yes ; anything is better than this doubt and anxiety. But I cannot think of taking you with me. I fully appreciate your kindness ; but your own interests demand that you should be here.' \"My own interests will have to wait,\" Egmont answered decisively. \" The only thing to be done now is to pack our portmanteaus and catch the first train that we can. There is no time to lose, for Snowdon will go abroad as soon as he can make arrangements. Not that he is a coward, or he would not have sent us the address of his solicitors.\" The Earl allowed himself to be guided by Egmont, so that in little more than an hour they were in a reserved compartment on their way to London. From the station they drove straight to Snowdon's solicitors in Bedford Row, and were ushered into the private room of the junior partner. \" You have come about Dr. Snowdon's affairs,\" the latter began when his visitors were seated. \" Fortunately, Doctor Snowdon called upon me at ten o'clock this morning, and gave me his instructions, though I hardly expected to see you so soon, my lord ; and this gentleman \" \" Is my friend Mr. Egmont, who is staying with me at Duddlestone Castle.\" \" I may add that I am an intimate and old friend of Doctor Snowdon's as well ; so I thought I might do some good if I were to see him.\" \" I am sorry to say, Mr. Egmont, that Doctor Snowdon did not mention your name to me. In regard to your lordship, he emphatically stated that he would only communicate with you through me.\" \" Then I am to understand sir, that you refuse to give us his address?\" \" I am obliged to act according to my client's instructions, my lord.\""], [175, "Pursued. 167 \"Yes, yes, of course,\" Egmont interrupted: \"But if I were to write a telegram, asking him to see me alone, would you send it to his address ? \" \" I see no harm in my doing that,\" the solicitor replied, who, in his own heart did not relish the business at all, for he belonged to that class generally known as old family solicitors. Egmont wrote the telegram, which was as follows : \" Have come up with Duddlestone. Grant me a private inter view alone in strict confidence. Do this for Heaven's sake Reply to Bedford Row. \u2014 Egmont.\" \"AVhen shall I get a reply?\" \" AVill you call here in an hour's time ?\" \" Certainly, with pleasure.\" The solicitor touched his hand-bell, and the visitors were shown out. Then instead of telling his clerk to send off the telegram, he told him to call a hansom, and ordered the cabman to drive to Jermyn Street."], [176, "CHAPTER VII. The Fugitives. jT IS necessary that we should now follow the course of Lady Duddlestone and Snowdon on their journey to London. They had not been in the train more than half an hour before Snowdon noticed that his companion was seriously ill. The events of the day had overtaxed her strength ; for although her flight had been premeditated it had at the last taken place so suddenly, that now, when the fatal step had been taken, she suffered from a dangerous reaction. Her nervous system had been completely deranged by the medicines which she had taken. This Snowdon saw with alarm. It seemed probable that his ex periment would fail at the moment of success. The situation was perilous. Fortunately, he had in his dressing-bag some powerful restoratives, the stimulating effect of which would last till they reached London, when he determined to take Norah \u2014 for by that name we must now- call her \u2014 to the lodgings in Jermyn Street where he had resided when he lived in town. Accordingly he sent a telegram to his former landlady from the first station at which they stopped. Then he devoted himself to the woman whom he idol ised and worshipped, the woman from whom he had been kept apart by an evil conjunction of circumstances, but who was now his special possession for life. Even his anxiety fled as she clung to him with her arms round his neck, and pressed her lips to his. 168"], [177, "The fugitives. 169 \"My darling, you have saved me from slavery for a life of glorious freedom !

He has gone from your life now. The past is done with. AA'e must live in the future for one another.\" \"I have no one but you to live for now Ralph.

England with its cold climate and colder conventionalities, is not a land for a love like ours. I must show you the glories of the East where I vowed that I would still claim the love which I knew you had given me. Often when I gazed at the star-lit heavens I fancied that your spirit was hover ing near me. Then for the time, I had relief from that misery which turned earth into hell, and made my brain a seething pandemonium of frantic rage. Your spirit brought with it an atmosphere of sacred calm, and I felt that the communion of souls was not confined to the life hereafter. But now my darling, we will never part.\" A strange, nervous feeling came over Norah as she stood with her lover on the crowded platform at Paddington, and she had to cling for support to Snowdon's arm. For the first time she re cognized the shame of her position. But the feeling was but transitory, and passed away before their cab stopped in Jermyn Street, where everything was in readiness for them. The unsuspecting landlady, fully believing Snowdon's telegram stating that he had been married that morning, and had to spend one night in London before starting for the continent, received them with curtsies and blushes which would have done credit to the immortal Mrs. Gamp, but which failed to have the effect which she intended. Snowdon was too anxious about Norah's health to pav"], [178, "The Doctor of Duddlestone. 170 attention to anything else, and she felt too faint to notice the smiling manner of the landlady. Dinner and the champagne which accompanied it, somewhat revived her and she was able to listen to Snowdon's plans. These were simple. He proposed that they should devote the following morning to making certain necessary arrangements, for Norah had come away without any luggage, and should go to Dover in the afternoon, whence they could cross over to the continent on the next day. \" But Ralph, suppose that we are followed ! Fancy, if we were recognised in the streets ! I shall never feel safe till we are out of England.\" \" I shall be with you, darling, so there can't be any danger.\" The truth was that the idea of pursuit had never occurred to Snowdon. It seemed madness to think that at the end of the nineteenth century an irate husband should pursue his wife and her lover. Yet Norah knew the character of Lord Duddlestone too well not to be afraid of him. She knew that he would not allow the honour of his race to be violated with impunity ; though how he would defend that honour she could not guess. As we have already seen, Snowdon visited his solicitor the first thing in the morning, and then he and Norah made their necessary purchases. Before lunch their luggage was packed, and as they sat down to their last meal in London they con gratulated each other on the speed with which they had made their preparations. The spirits of both were elated to the high est pitch when Snowdon's solicitor, Mr. Maybrick, was announced. He briefly described the visit of Lord Duddlestone and Egmont, and handed to Snowdon the telegram which Egmont had written. Snowdon read it, and then gave it to Norah. \" Of course, you won't see him, Ralph.\" \" Certainly not. I can't understand why Egmont should meddle in the matter. Besides there is no time. And yet it seems cowardly to avoid him.\" \" But you must not go. AVhy should it be cowardly to avoid him ? I hate him.

For the second time she wants to destroy my happiness.\" Still Snowdon hesitated. Egmont had been his greatest friend, and it would be hard to forfeit his friendship. But it could not be helped, Norah was feverishly anxious to leave London, and would not hear of going by a later train. So Snowdon wrote a hurried note to Egmont. \" Dear Egmont, \" It is impossible for me to see you, as by the time you get this, we shall probably have left London ; nor could any good come from an interview. \" Yours sincerely, \"Ralph Snowdon.\" Mr. Maybrick departed with the letter, and the lovers were left alone. Egmont had only held a very faint hope that Snowdon would consent to see him, so was not surprised at the answer to his re quest. But Lord Duddlestone was furious. \" I will follow them. Mr. Maybrick you know where they have gone to ; surely etiquette does not forbid you to help me to save my wife ? \" But Snowdon had not told his solicitor where he meant to go, so even if he had been willing to do so, Mr. Maybrick could give no information. \" Can nothing be done ? \" the unhappy man asked. \" I can only advise you to employ private detectives; though I am afraid it is too late now, to stop the fugitives. You might find out where they had gone, and follow them. But I warn you, my lord, that my client is a most obstinate man to deal with.\" \" The way I shall deal with him will break his obstinacy, sir. But we are wasting time. I am sorry to have given you so much trouble. Good-day ! \" Egmont thought that any further pursuit was hopeless, but the Earl was not to be thwarted. \"I must go on,\" he said excitedly. \" If I remain idle, I shall go mad. If we have no clue, we will find one.\""], [180, "Tlie Doctor of Duddlestone. 172 Hardly had he spoken when a barrister, who was an old college friend of Egmont's, stopped him. \" My dear Egmont, how are you ? I have only just been thinking of you. AVbom do you think I met at Victoria Station not half an hour ago ? None other but our old friend Snowdon. I hadn't seen him for ages, and it appears that he has joined the noble army of Benedicts. He introduced me to his wife, one of the handsomest women I ever met. They were just off to Dover he told me, so I waited to see the last of them. Great Heaven ! what is the matter ? \" But the Earl had already hailed a hansom. \" To Victoria Station ! \" he shouted as he half-pushed Egmont before him, and left the barrister to regard him as a rare specimen of the genus lunatic. By a judicious bestowal of loose silver upon various porters, it was soon made evident that Snowdon and Norah had gone to Dover by the three-thirty express, so the Earl and Egmont deter mined to follow by a special train, for Egmont was afraid to leave his companion in his present state of mind. He also had the forethought to telegraph to the Dover station master asking him to privately watch the fugitives, since he could not tell whether they would stop in Dover or cross immediately to Calais. On arriving at Dover it was discovered that they had gone to the Lord AVarden Hotel, whither the Earl and Egmont followed them. \" How do you mean to proceed ? \" Egmont asked nervously. The Earl clasped and clutched the stick within his hand. \" Lady Duddlestone must return with me. As for the base scoundrel who has betrayed her, I will \" He did not conclude the sentence in words, but his flashing eyes left no doubt as to his meaning. \" My lord, for your own sake keep calm ! Recollect that any scene in the hotel will create a terrible scandal, which it would be impossible to hush up.\" \" Then keep him away from me, or I shall kill him.\" Snowdon and Norah had taken a private sitting-room at the"], [181, "The fugitives. 173 hotel, so Egmont implored the Earl to allow him to see them first alone. With great reluctance the Earl was at last persuaded to consent, and Egmont sent a waiter up with his card. Norah wanted her lover to refuse to see him. She was trembling with fear, and when the waiter said that \" the gentleman was accompanied by another elderly gentleman \" she fell back in a faint. AA'hereupon the waiter concluded that the elderly gentle man was Norah's father, and being of a romantic disposition his sympathies were forthwith enlisted. \" Shall I say that you have gone out for a walk, sir ? \" \" Yes ; and then come back here. I shall require your services, for which you will be well paid. Do you understand me ? By the way, I shall cross by the seven o'clock boat. Tell these gentlemen I have ordered dinner here for seven-thirty.\" The waiter delivered his message and returned as he was bid, by which time Norah had recovered consciousness. \" Get my luggage down to the boat as quickly as possible. I suppose there is some means of egress from this place without going through the entrance hall ? \" \" Yes, sir. I will show it to you, sir, when you're ready to go.\" \" The sooner the better. AVe are ready now. See that those two gentlemen are out of the way first.\" So Ralph and Norah left England"], [182, "174 CHAPTER VIII. Storm Succeeds Storm. GMONT hoped that a night's rest would leave Lord Duddlestone in a calm frame of mind, and that he would take the usual course of instituting divorce proceedings, since it was not likely that there would be any defence. In this view, however, he was mistaken. The Earl woke in the morning with the sole object of recovering the wife of whom he had been robbed, and of killing the robber. In vain did Egmont remonstrate with him and remind him that the days of duelling were over ; that the law, and neither the sword nor the pistol gave redress to the injured husband. The Earl listened to him with politeness that was evidently con strained, and then answered : \" I thank you for your advice. It is the advice of the sensible man of this fag-end of the nineteenth century, but I was born too soon to be able to follow it. I have suffered a wrong which cannot be estimated in pounds, shillings and pence, nor do I wish a jury of twelve tradespeople to estimate that wrong. An Earl of Duddlestone should be able to right himself without the intervention of strangers, or he is not worthy of the name which he bears.\" Egmont had the sense to see that further remonstrance at that time would be worse than useless. After all, he thought, the Earl's actions were nothing to do with him. He had only been"], [183, "Storm succeeds storm. 175 his guest for a few days as a political candidate, and could hardly be expected to accompany the Earl in a wild-goose chase over Europe. Snowdon and Norah had nearly twenty-four hours' start, and even if the Earl found them, he would be powerless to do anything. Norah would refuse to return to him, and Snowdon would probably treat him with contempt, while, if the Earl in a paroxysm of rage, were to shoot his rival, the scandal would only be increased. To the ambitious young politician, the Earl's ide.'.s were those of a madman. \"But,\" he communed with himself; \"I must not leave the madman alone, and I must attend to my candidature. I might telegraph to Levantine to come down, but Levantine would hardly thank me for taking him away from his own political campaign. Ah ! I have it. I'll telegraph to that old Rector of Duddlestone to come down immediately; and to Agnes, to tell her to see that he comes.\" Acting upon this idea, Egmont immediately telegraphed to Mr. Ridley and to his own wife. The Earl was too proud to permit a sign of grief to escape him before the eyes of the hotel servants, and spent the morning in writing letters, which he tore up almost directly after he had written them. Egmont was glad that he had not declared his intention of immediately crossing over to the continent, but the Earl had already seen that such a course would be useless in these days of express trains, and that he had a better chance of discovering Snowdon's whereabouts from his English business acquaintances, such as his lawyers or his bankers. But there was another question which vexed him, namely, how could the dishonour done to his name be kept a secret ? \"Send a paragraph to the papers, announcing that the Countess of Duddlestone, whose health prevents her taking any active part in the forthcoming election, is travelling abroad accompanied by a pa*y of friends and her medical attendant, Mr. Snowdon,\" Egmont suggested. \" Then ; if you can persuade her to return to you, nobody will be any the wiser.\" \"It would be a lie,\" the Earl rejoined."], [184, "The Doctor of Duddlestone. 176 \" Hardly a lie.\" Egmont replied. \" Let us call it a slight deviation from the strict path of truth. I am only advi/ng, my lord, in your own interests, and in the interests of the name which you bear. Further, let me impress upon you one fact. Ralph Snowdon belongs to a class of men, who are eaten up by vanity. Therefore, if it is publicly stated that he is acting as her medical attendant, you will wound his self-pride, which I assure you, judging from my personal knowledge of the man, is his most vulnerable part. Act on my advice, my lord, for I am sure it is good.\" The Earl had been walking up and down the room with rest less strides like a wild beast in its cage, while Egmont was speaking. AVhen Egmont ceased, he rang the bell furiously. \"AA'hen does the next boat start for Calais?\" he inquired of the astonished waiter who answered the summons. \" At seven o'clock, my lord,\" replied the waiter, who was per fectly aware of all that had occurred, as were the other servants in the hotel. \" Good ! See that my portmanteau is taken to the boat, for I shall go to Calais to-night.\" The waiter bowed acquiescence and withdrew. Egmont made no objection to this new arrangement, for he thought that Mr. Ridley must arrive before it would be time to leave the hotel. Nor was he wrong, for early in the afternoon the Rector made his appearance. A look from Egmont informed him not to say that he had been telegraphed for, and the Earl appeared to regard his presence as a matter of course. \" I cross to Calais by the evening boat, Ridley,\" he said after they had shaken hands in a silence more expressive of sympathy than any words. \" AA'ill you come with me ? Egmont must return to his political campaign.\" \"Not for a moment, if I can be of the slightest service,\" Egmont interrupted. \" I have been trying to persuade the Earl to remain in England at least for a short period, and not to em bark in what must be a fruitless chase after a man who has got a clear start.\""], [185, "Storm succeeds storm. 177 \"And if I were to remain in England, I should go mad.\" Poor Mr. Ridley was in a dilemma. He neither wished to oppose, nor was he anxious to be his travelling companion. For the moment, he was relieved from his embarrassment by the en trance of a waiter with a card, which he handed to the Earl. It was the card of Snowdon's solicitor, Mr. John Maybrick. \" I wonder what he can have to say,\" remarked Egmont, to whom the Earl had handed the card. \" Do you intend to see him?\" \"Certainly. AVhy not? The fellow may bring important news, or perhaps he wants to throw aside his client.\" But such was far from being Mr. Maybrick's intention. He had come down on a very different errand, which he was not slow to explain. \" I have come down from town immediately to see you, my lord, guessing that I should find you here, on account of a visit which I received from a lady this morning, who was a perfect stranger to me. She gave the name of the Countess of Duddlestone. She informed me that her maiden name was Rose Leclerque and that she was married to you in Paris eleven years ago. I came down to ask you if there were any truth in the statement, before apprising my client, Mr. Snowdon, of the fact, as of course, her story considerably alters his position, as well as that of the reputed Countess.\" The Earl put his hand to his brow to collect his thoughts, while Mr. Ridley and Egmont regarded him with silent amaze ment. It was some seconds, which seemed minutes, before he answered. \"The statement is absolutely false. Rose Leclerque died within three months of the marriage.\" \" Then as I understand the facts, the lady who called upon me was aware of the marriage, and is endeavouring to make money out of her knowledge? \" \"You may understand the facts in any way you please, sir,\" the Earl replied haughtily. \" Then, my lord, it will be my duty to examine into the lady's M"], [186, "178 The Doctor of Duddlestone. tale, for Mr. Snowdon informed me that he should marry the lady who has eloped with him, as soon as he was legally able to do so.\" \" Then he will have to wait for my death, sir.\" \"As you please, my lord.\" Mr. Maybrick rose as if to depart, but stopped on his way to the door, and said, \" Perhaps your lordship might be curious to see this lady who has the audacity to claim to be the Countess of Duddlestone ; if so, nothing could be more easily arranged, as the lady is downstairs at the present moment.\" \" I have already told you that this woman is an impostor.\" \"Then the impostor must be punished in the interests of justice. Besides, the lady wishes to sell her information to my client, and it is my duty to prevent her getting money from him under false pretences.\" This last argument was too plausible not to be convincing. Egmont saw at once that Maybrick held the trump cards ; even if the lady were the most arrant impostor in the world, it was evident that she held the key to a dark chapter in the Earl's life, and that she had chosen a good time at which to threaten to divulge it, while if, as it was possible, she really were the Countess of Duddlestone, she had judged her visit well, thinking that now if any, would be the time for the Earl to acknowledge her. So at least reasoned Egmont as a man of the world. \" Could the Earl see her here without any scene being made ? \" he asked Maybrick, who replied in the affirmative. \" Do you really think I ought to see this woman, Egmont ?\" \" I do, my lord,\" Egmont said firmly. \" Very well, let it be so ! \" Maybrick required no second permission, and left the room hurriedly. Neither the Earl, Ridley nor Egmont spoke a word, they were all too much occupied with their own thoughts, and the excitement created by the keenest expectation, but they were not kept long in suspense. The door opened, and Maybrick ushered into the room a lady dressed in black and thickly veiled. She walked straight up to the Earl, and raising her. veil said :"], [187, "Storm succeeds storm. 179 \" Does the Earl of Duddlestone now deny the existence of his wife ? \" The Earl stepped back a couple of paces, like a man who has been mortally wounded. Mr. Ridley leant forward with astonish ment depicted on every feature of his face. Maybrick stood by, impassive, except for a smile of triumph which lurked about the corners of his mouth, and Egmont looked on with the air of a man witnessing a tragedy at a theatre, in which the heroine was denouncing the betrayer. His principal thought was that the scene was a trifle stale. But Rose Leclerque knew how to play the tragedy queen without overdoing the part. Tall, with a commanding presence, and eyes which now seemed to flash fire, she stood before the Earl awaiting his answer. Eleven years ago she must have been a beautiful type of Frenchwoman. But now only the traces of beauty were left. The sunken cheeks had lent an un natural brilliance to her eyes, and it was evident that much of her personal appearance was due to art. Egmont's inward criticism was, \" A faded beauty, with a deuce of a temper.\" The Earl's answer proved that the woman spoke the truth. \" I believed you were dead.\" \"And I wished you to believe it,\" she answered furiously. \" AVhat did you do for me ? You insulted me as a man of your character only knows how to insult a woman. You married me and when the honeymoon of your passion was spent, you calmly told me that I was not fit to fill the position of your Countess, and offered me a pension as if I were a servant wrong- fully dismissed. You will recollect the scorn with which I refused your pension and left you. You tremble, Lord Duddlestone. I left you vowing to have my revenge against you. I have waited patiently but it has come at last. My foster-sister, who was my faithful friend as well as maid, was suffering from consumption from which the doctors said it was impossible for her to recover.

I knew you would marry again, and I thought then to avenge myself by appearing to you during your honey moon ; but I did not know to whom you were going to be married. AVhen I heard that it was to Norah Henley, I determined to wait, for I knew that she did not love you, and I heard that she had been engaged to Ralph Snowdon. I gathered information both about Norah Henley and Snowdon, and I foresaw that your new married life would neither be long nor happy while it lasted, and I waited patiently for the explosion. I knew that it was coming for your reputed wife's maid, Lilian Brown, was in my pay. She told me that Ralph Snowdon had come to Duddlestone, and of the clandestine meeetings which he had with the reputed Countess- Then I heard of the elopement, and determined to see for myself how the proud Earl of Duddlestone bore his disgrace.\" She had spoken fast and vehemently, like a woman pouring out her pent-up rage. The Earl had listened with his arms folded across his chest, and though he had not spoken a word, his face was as white as marble. He was too proud to acknowledge the folly of his younger days, which he thought had been expiated long ago \u2014 a folly which had not lasted three months. It had only been folly ; not sin. Now, he was a bigamist, and a twice disgraced husband. Raising his hand as if to ward off the woman who had confronted him, he staggered back and fell into a chair. \" Great Heaven ! You have killed him,\" Egmont exclaimed springing up from his seat, and rushing towards the Earl. \" And if I have, what then ? Did he not try to kill me, and has he not thought for years that he succeeded ? Look at this shrivelled skin and sunken cheeks ! I was beautiful once, and he has made me what I am. And now, after these years of suffering do you expect me to pity him, who never had any pity for mi No a thousand times, no. But I wish him to live, so that he may feel his disgrace every day and every hour of the day, so that I may witness his humiliation when men point the finger of scorn at him. And when at last shame has killed him, I will appear at the side of his grave.\" Then with the haughtiest disdain she walked out of the room, followed by Maybrick."], [189, "CHAPTER IX. The Murder, R. MAYBRICK who was fully aware of Snowdon's movements and address lost no time in communi cating to him the scene which we have just described, and the visit of Rose Leclerque to him at his chambers which was the preface to the scene. He wrote this letter from the hotel at Dover for two reasons. The first was he wished to remain there till it was certain that the Earl's health had not been seriously affected, and the second was that he wished to watch the Earl's movements. Miss Leclerque had taken rooms at a smaller hotel in the town, so that she could hear from Maybrick every hour of the day, and also see for herself the actions of the Earl. Egmont, when he had seen the recovery of the Earl from what only proved to be a sudden rushing of the blood to the heart, left him to the care of Ridley, and returned to his political cam paign, making the hotel at Duddlestone, instead of Duddlestone Castle his headquarters where he was joined by his wife Agnes- To the sentimentalist this conduct might appear selfish, but Egmont was an ambitious politician and man of the world, while his acquaintanceship with the Earl was of the shortest and slightest i\"8i"], [190, "The Doctor of Duddlestone. 182 nature. His chief regret was that he had been an unwilling witness at a domestic tragedy. So the Earl was left alone with Mr. Ridley, who, kind-hearted man though he was, was perfectly incapable of advising a man situated as the Earl was. He could give him silent sympathy, but he could not rouse him from the apathy into which he had fallen, from the double blow which he had received. Such then was the situation at Dover. Let us now cross the Channel and join Norah and Ralph Snowdon, who were lodged in a handsome suite of rooms in the Grand Hotel at Paris. Though Norah was sufficiently recovered after her fainting fit to be able to bear the journey to the French capital, yet she was far from strong, and her state of health gave Snowdon the great est anxiety. In order to resuscitate in Norah's heart, the love which she had once felt for him as well as to establish a complete influence over her, he had not scrupled to make use of certain electric forces which he had studied during his wanderings in the East. Under the phrases of hypnotism and animal magnetism, some of these forces are known to English medical men, though knowledge concerning the electricity of the human body is still in its infancy. Snowdon was now surprised at the complete ascend ancy which he had gained over Norah. His will governed her every action. She could not bear for him to be absent from her. They had not been forty-eight hours in Paris before he recognized that he had set in motion a force which his science was unable to stop. A child may send a cannon-ball rolling down a hill, but a Sampson would be unable to arrest its progress. Not that at the present time he had any wish to destroy his influence. His success had not as yet been followed by any feel ing of satiety, nor had he the slightest remorse for his conduct. Besides, if Maybrick's news should prove to be true, he could marry Norah within a few days, as soon as Rose Leclerque's marriage to the Earl of Duddlestone was an established fact, and thus repair the wrong which he had committed. After some hesitation he had acquainted Norah with this news, apd had"], [191, "The murder. 183 written to Maybrick instructing him to take every measure to prove the validity of the Earl's first marriage. \" And when that is firmly established, Norah my own darling, you shall be my wife in name as well as in fact,\" he said as he sealed and addressed the envelope, and for answer she placed her arms around his neck and drew his lips to hers. But Norah would not have been a woman, if she had not ex perienced keen feelings of self-degradation at the thought, that after all, she had only been the Earl's mistress for the last ten years, and these feelings changed her former indifference towards the Earl into positive hatred. \" So, for ten years, I, whom people called the proud Countess of Duddlestone, have been living in a fool's paradise. Ralph, I could never go back to England unless it were to \" \" Were to do what, darling ? \" She nestled closer to him and whispered in his ear. \" Ralph, I could kill that man.\" For the moment Snowdon was astounded, forgetting the passionate nature of his wife ; but he quickly recovered him self. \" No, Norah my dearest. You must not harbour thoughts like these. As it is, his sufferings must be almost intolerable, and if this woman Rose Leclerque asserts her right to be called Countess of Duddlestone, the scandal will be enough to drive the Earl out of England. Did you never have any idea of this little episode in the Earl's past life ? \" \"No. I should have killed him, as I could kill him now if I had known.\" Hardly were the words spoken than a waiter entered with a telegram which he handed to Snowdon. The latter opened and read it with amazement. \"Good Heaven !\" he exclaimed. \"The Earl has been murdered.' The telegram was from Maybrick, and was as follows : \" The Earl of Duddlestone found dead in his bed this morn ing, stabbed to the heart. Murder evident. Letter follows. \u2014 Maverick.\""], [192, "The Doctor of Duddlestone. 184 \"AVho could have done it? AVhat can have been the motive?\" Norah asked breathlessly. \" Impossible to say until we hear the details from Maybrick. It may only have been a vulgar hotel robbery, and the robber have murdered his victim to avoid discovery, or it may have been a carefully planned plot.\" \"Plot! Plot of whom?\" \"Rose Leclerque would be considerably benefited by the Earl's death I should imagine. I don't know what her income would be as the Dowager Countess of Duddlestone, but something con siderable, sure to be ; to say nothing of her becoming a prize in the matrimonial market. If I were a poor man, I should be inclined to dispute her marriage for both our sakes. As it is I don't care a rap. AA'hat ! Another telegram ! \" A waiter had entered the room and handed a second telegram to Snowdon. Norah looked up expectantly. \" Only from Maybrick to say he is crossing by the night boat and will be with us to-morrow morning.\" \" I'm glad of that. Personal interviews are preferable to letters. It seemed astonishing even to Snowdon, that Norah should be so callous about the death of the Earl, for she gave vent to no ex pressions either of joy or of sorrow. AA'as Snowdon's power over her so great that she was unable to take interest in anything which was outside his personal magnetism ? He asked himself the question, and shuddered like a surgeon who has made a bold experiment and cannot tell what the result will be. Nor did the news of the Earl's death affect her enjoyment. In the evening she was sufficiently strong to be able to go to the theatre, and witness one of those French comedies, dear to Parisians, though the translations in English border on crude vulgarity. She was intoxicated by her love for Snowdon. He was her sun which gave her life ; without him the world was cold darkness. Maybrick arrived in time for the dejeuner, that meal, half breakfast, half luncheon, which can only be enjoyed to perfection in pleasure-loving Paris. The busy Bedford l.ow solicitor seemec}"], [193, "The murder. 185 out of place at the luxurious repast, with its champagne and fruit, and he was not sorry when it was over and Snowdon passing him his cigar-case said : \" Now for the details of this crime, Maybrick ; for crime I suppose it is.\" \"There is not the slightest doubt about that. A waiter acting upon orders received over-night, took shaving water to the Earl's bedroom at eight o'clock yesterday morning, and as he thought at first, found him fast asleep. Failing to wake him, he went to the bed, and saw that he was dead. He at once called for assistance. A doctor who happened to be staying in the hotel, examined the body and found a wound under the heart, which must have been inflicted by a dagger or stiletto. Life had been extinct for some hours. The room was thoroughly searched by the police, but no weapon was found, nor was any of the Earl's property missing, so that robbery could not have been the motive for the crime.\" \" Then the police are without a clue, I presume? \" \" If they have one, they are reticent about it. Of course, the whole scandal both concerning yourself, and concerning Rose Leclerque came out. The clergyman Mr. Ridley and myself were examined by the police, and a visit was paid to the small hotel where Rose Leclerque was and still is staying ; but there was no doubt, that she stayed there the whole night, so could not have done the deed herself.\" \" You put a strong accent on the herself I notice.\" \" A woman who employs a lady's maid as a private detective may have accomplices in crime.\" \" H'm ! I should have thought the days of hired assassins were over.\" \" I only suggest a theory \" Maybrick answered quietly. \" She had much to gain by the Earl's death.\" Snowdon- hesitated before he asked his next question. \"And will this scandal become public property? \\ mean will it be reported in the press with headlines, so that all whp read may learn ? \" \" Jt will be impossible to prevent it. In the first place, the"], [194, "The Doctor of Duddlestone. 186 story must come out in evidence at the inquest. In the second place, there is Rose Leclerque to deal with.\" Snowdon signalled to Norah to leave the room ; when he was alone with Maybrick, he continued : \"For her sake I would spend any money to avoid a scandal.\" \"I perfectly understand your feelings, Mr. Snowdon, but it is absolutely impossible to avoid a scandal. An inquest is impera tive, and one of the first questions which the coroner will ask, will be what was the cause of the Earl's presence at Dover. I expect that both you, the Countess of Duddlestone, and Rose Leclerque will be subp\u0153naed. Mr. Ridley and I have already received our subp\u0153nas. Rose Leclerque, I need hardly tell you, is under the strictest surveillance of the police and I should advise you and the Countess to return to England without delay so as to be at hand to give evidence without causing trouble to the authorities.\" \" It will be a terrible ordeal for the Countess, Maybrick.\" The lawyer slightly shrugged his shoulders. He was a married man, and had little sympathy for Norah. \"The inquest is fixed for the day after to-morrow,\" he said abruptly. \"And you strongly advise me to be present?\" \" Most strongly.\" \" Very well ; I will be there.\" \"You must excuse me saying one thing, Mr. Snowdon, disagreeable as it will be for you to hear ; but I have staked my honour to the police as a professional man, that you and the Countess will be present. If I had not done so, you like Rose Leclerque, would now be under the surveillance of the police. You must pardon me for telling you the truth; but you will readily understand that if a poor woman is suspected of having accom plices a rich man is doubly suspected, especially when the evidence tends to show that he had feelings of deep animosity against the murdered man.\" Snowdon rose from his seat impatiently."], [195, "The murder. 187 \"Am I suspected then of complicity in this murder?\" he asked angrily. \"Yes. That is why I came over to see you instead of writing to you.\" \" Oh heaven ! this is too awful,\" Snowdon groaned, as he sank back into his chair, looking the picture of misery. But the lawyer was merciless. \"You must admit that the facts are against you. You run away with another man's wife. The husband pursues you, and during the pursuit he is found murdered in his bed, so that you escape his vengeance and a probable divorce suit, and at the same time are at liberty to marry the lady, not to say anything of the change in the lady's financial position. Many murders have been committed with a far lesser motive than this. The facts are against you, Mr. Snowdon, whichever way you look at them. Besides, I warn you that you have a dangerous enemy in Mr. Ridley.\" \" Ridley ! AA'hat harm can I ever have done him ? \" \" Unconsciously a great deal. You robbed him of much of the intimacy which he had enjoyed with the Earl before you came to Duddlestone. In other words, you made him jealous of you. Also he believes you to be an atheist, and as a clergyman, naturally he is angry with you for running away with his friend's wife and the ' Lady Bountiful of his parish.' \" \" You forget that you are a lawyer. You are not a prophet and I am not King David,\" Snowdon retorted, with an unconcerned appearance which was not assumed ; for when he had recovered from the first shock given to him by the discovery that he was sus pected of murder, he regained his self-possession as a philosopher and man of the world. \" Let us now discuss business. Of course you will act for me in this matter, and do all you can on my behalf, for I presume that whatever the officials at Scotland Yard may think about the crime you are perfectly satisfied in your own mind that I am innocent. The Countess and I are ready to go back to Dover with you this afternoon, where we will remain in some quiet hotel until the inquest is over. And now what course do you intend to pursue in regard to Rose Leclerque?\""], [196, "188 7%!? Doctor of Duddlestone. \" The death of the Earl makes a difference to your interests.\" \" Not in the slightest degree. You know my financial position perfectly well, and ought to know that tbe question of money does not affect me. Even if Rose Leclerque failed to prove the mar riage, neither the Countess nor I would touch a halfpenny of the Earl's money.\" \" I fully believe that, Mr. Snowdon. So we return to Dover this afternoon, and we can discuss further proceedings after the inquest.\""], [197, "CHAPTER X. The Fall of the Curtain. HE inquest upon the Earl of Duddlestone had resulted in an open verdict ; in other words, the jury found that he had been murdered by some person or persons unknown. Unfortunately for Snowdon and Norah, these twelve honest Englishmen had thought fit to add a rider to their verdict, to the effect that Mr. Ralph Snowdon's conduct had been dishonourable in the extreme. Snowdon had undergone a severe cross-examination at the hands of the solicitor who represented the next-of-kin to the deceased Earl. Rose Leclerque had also been called into the witness-box, but her evidence was only important inasmuch as she swore that she was the legitimate Countess of Duddlestone. Thus, though the murder of an Earl, would only have constituted a nine days' wonder, the scandal created by Rose, made the evening papers come out with flaring headlines, such as, \" The Duddlestone Mystery.\" \" An Earl guilty of bigamy,\" and other sensational titles which could only be evolved out of an editorial brain. But the inquest had failed to throw any light upon the discovery of the murderer, and whatever suspicions the police might have formed they kept to themselves. But the world or rather that portion of it, which takes an interest in the doings of the upper ten thousand, chiefly concerned itself with the question as to who was the Countess of Duddle stone. Norah had taken no steps to resist the claim of Rose Leclerque ; but the solicitor to the Duddlestone family refused 189"], [198, "The Doctor of Duddlestone. 190 to recognise her, and to pay her the income to which as Dowager Countess, she would be entitled, until he received an order from the High Court of Justice compelling him to do so. Thus financially, Rose had not benefited by the death of the Earl, though she assumed the title of Dowager Countess and took lodgings in Mayfair, where her widow's weeds imposed upon the landlady and neighbouring tradespeople, and where also her movements were rigidly observed by the detectives from Scotland Yard. Snowdon having quietly married Norah at a registry office was also living in London in Sloane Street. Norah now had no will of her own, or rather her will was entirely subservient to Snowdon's. The erstwhile proud Countess was now the slave of her husband, and kissed the fetters of her slavery, much to Snowdon's consternation, for his science told him that Norah's reason was in danger. He could not conceal the truth from himself. Before long, Norah would be an incurable lunatic. Perhaps it would not have been different, even if Norah had not been subject to the mesmeric force of Snowdon's will. Estranged from that world of society, in which for many years, she had been a reigning queen ; and rendered reckless by the scandal which attached to her name, Norah would doubtless have joined the sad regiment of female suicides if it had not been for her husband. AVhether or not she loved Ralph Snowdon according to the vulgar interpretation of love, is a question which for ever will remain unanswered. Her love for him seemed to be a strange, unreal, fictitious love ; a love devoid of reason ; a love which had caused her life to become merely an unconscious existence. Such was and must ever be the result of mesmeric influence, when exercised by man over woman. But besides the future inevitable insanity of Norah, Snowdon was embarrassed with another trouble. He was subject to the espionage of the police, and would be so subject until the murderer of the Earl of Duddlestone was discovered. In addition to this, he was constantly worried by Rose Leclerque for pecu-"], [199, "The fall of the curtain. 191 niary assistance. Of course, he knew that she had no claim upon him of any sort whatsoever. On the contrary, she had published his own wife's dishonour by claiming to be the legitimate Dowager Countess of Duddlestone, but she took advantage of her connection with him, small as it was, to borrow money from him, in order to defray the legal expenses which she was obliged to pay, in order to compel the executors of the Earl of Duddle stone to give her the income to which she was entitled as his widow. To Snowdon, the money was a matter of little con sequence, but he had a rooted conviction that Rose Leclerque was a murderess, and felt that morally, he was her accomplice after the murder. Knowing the mesmeric force which nature had implanted in him, Snowdon at last resolved to exercise it upon Rose. Accordingly, he became a constant visitor at her rooms in Mayfair, and soon succeeded in gaining Rose's confidence ; or at least, she allowed him to think so. \" AVhy do you come here ? \" Rose asked him, one afternoon. \" You cannot deceive me. You may pretend to love me, but I know that your nature is not capable of love. I do not think that any woman could possibly love you.\" \"You forget that I have a wife,\" Snowdon replied shortly. \" And do you think that she loves you ? She adores you with the unhealthy adoration which springs from mesmeric animalism ; but at the same time, I warn you that she will kill you. I know it as well as I know that you believe me to be the murderess of Lord Duddlestone. Now listen to me. Your time has come ! You will die like Lord Duddlestone died, and by the same hand.\" \" You are mad ! AVhat \" \"Yes ; I am mad. I am a madwoman.\" She had risen, and was standing before him. Her eyes shone like burning coals, with an expression which commanded implicit obedience, and rendered Snowdon powerless before her, though he was fully aware of the nature of the force which she was exercising upon him. Resistance was fruitless. He was bound to yield before her superior electricity."], [200, "The Doctor of Duddlestone. 192 She placed her hands upon his shoulders, and a shock which for the moment made his heart stand still, passed through his body. Then he lost all consciousness. She immediately touched an electric bell, and a tall man, whose features plainly showed that he was a Frenchman, entered the room. He would have been considered handsome but for a certain sinister expression on his countenance, which is gen erally associated with ideas of his Satanic majesty. Paul Leclerque, for the new arrival was Rose's brother, was one of the most dangerous men in Europe. At this time various warrants were out for him under names which he had assumed, but so far he had managed to evade the vigilance of the police. He was an anarchist, an assassin, and a thief of the worst description. \"You seem to have found him an easy victim,\" he remarked, cynically, as he gazed at Snowdon with a look of satisfaction. \" You are a wonderful hypnotist, my dear Rose.\" \" I have done my part of the work. It only remains for you to do yours. Is everything ready ? \" \" Yes. Alphonse will be here in a few moments with the four-wheeler to take him home to his mad wife. The rest will be easy.\" \" You make your usual mistake of being over-confident. Even when Norah has murdered Snowdon, and is confined in a madhouse, it will be no easy task for us to reap the profits. I never consider a deed accomplished until I have received the reward.\" \" Are you afraid of Maybrick then ? \" \" More than of anybody else.\" \" Bah ! There is nothing to be feared from Maybrick. I fear the clergyman Ridley more than him. But this man, Egmont, who has just been returned to Parliament, will be the worst thorn in our sides. Forewarned however is forearmed. Hush ! Here comes Alphonse.\" The new-comer bore the same stamp of villainy upon his countenance as did Paul Leclerque, but he possessed a far more"], [201, "The fall of the curtain. 193 powerful physique than did his companion. It was evident also from the way in which he addressed Rose that he was her lover, if not her husband. The two men then took Snowdon beneath the arms and half dragged half carried him into a four-wheeled cab which was waiting outside, and drove off with their victim to Sloane Street. But before they arrived at Snowdon's address Alphonse had pierced him to the heart with a stiletto. At the sound of the bell Norah herself came down, having previously received a telegram telling her that her husband was seriously ill, but would call for her on his way to an eminent doc tor who resided at Putney. Paul Leclerque hurried her to the carriage. \"He has had a fit, Mrs. Snowdon, and is still unconscious. I should not attempt to rouse him if I were you, till you reach Doctor Ferdinand's house in the Lower Richmond Road. Doctor Ferdinand has already been telegraphed to, and the cabman knows his address.\" Hardly conscious of what she was doing, Norah entered the cab which immediately drove off, leaving the two accomplices standing on the pavement, with a grim smile of satisfaction upon their faces. \" Not the mystery of a hansom cab, but the mystery of a four wheeler, though in this case the cabby could clear up the mystery if he chose, or rather if he were not a member of 'The Iron Brotherhood,' \" Paul remarked callously. \" I suppose we must wait for the morning papers before we hear the sequel.\" Then the two villains lit their cigarettes and strolled back to a select restaurant to dine together. It was not till they had arrived at the further end of King's Road that Norah recognised that her husband was lifeless. Then her frantic screams were terrible to hear. Acting upon the in structions which he had received from Paul and Alphonse, the cabman got down, and with well-simulated horror shouted for the police, three or four of whom were quickly on the spot. But before it was possible to prevent her, Norah having caught sight of the dagger, which Alphonse had purposely left in the cab, seized it"], [202, "The Doctor of Duddlestone. 194 and plunged it into her own heart, before the eyes of the police and the crowd which had collected. The evidence of the cabman at the inquest though false, was irrefutable. The deceased gentleman had called him in Piccadilly and told him to drive to Sloane Street where he was joined by the lady, and where he was then told to drive to Lower Richmond Road. He thought at first that the gentleman's manner was either queer or that he was the worse for drink. The next thing he heard was the screams of the lady, when he got off his box and called for the police. The coroner complimented him on the way in which he had given his evidence and for his prompt conduct in calling for the police, and the jury made up a subscription for him amongst themselves. The jury previously returned a verdict of suicide during temporary insanity in regard to Norah, and in regard to Snowdon said there was no evidence to prove whether he had taken his own life or had been killed by Norah. The death of the Earl of Duddlestone would probably have remained a mystery till this day, if it had not been for the dying confession of Rose Leclerque, which she made to Mr. Ridley. But the epilogue to the Duddlestone tragedy had better be written by the worthy Rector,"], [203, "EPILOGUE By The Rector of Duddlestone. Written to Arthur Egmont Esq., M.P. Duddlestone Rectory. May, 189\u2014 My dear Mr. Egmont, You have asked me to write down on paper the solution of the Duddlestone tragedy. To any man of my persuasion, the task would be a painful one. To me, as one of the oldest friends of the Earl of Duddlestone, the task is doubly painful ; and one which I should not undertake if I did not consider it a duty which I owe towards the memories of the dead. But my pen is not accustomed to narrations of the dreadfulesque, so I must beg of you to excuse my brevity. After the lengthy lawsuit which established the right of Rose Leclerque to the dowry and title of Countess of Duddlestone, she came to live at Duddlestone Castle, where she resided in the strictest retirement. None of her neighbours in the county condescended to pay her the most formal attentions. In the parlance of society, she was cut by the county ; nor with the exception of two Frenchmen, one of whom was her brother, and the other a former admirer or lover, did she ever receive any guests. Her establishment was of the most modest description, she was seldom seen abroad, and appeared to live the life of a recluse. 195 N 2"], [204, "The Doctor of Duddlestone. 196 At first ill-natured people said that she was posing as a forlorn widow, but time made no alteration in her way of living. The gossip which emanated from the servants' hall, stated that she lived almost entirely in one small suite of rooms, and only allowed one confidential maid to wait upon her. I need hardly tell you, Mr. Egmont, that I was surprised at the news which I had heard, for I had hitherto regarded the new Countess as an adventuress of the worst type. It was through a mere accident that I discovered the real cause of her retirement. Let me pause for a moment before I relate my discovery. I was returning home from visiting a sick parishioner, late at night, or to speak correctly, early in the morning, and had taken my way across Duddlestone Park in order to save the distance by the road. I was absorbed in thinking about the dying man whom I had just left, when I heard moans within a few yards from me. At first I thought they issued from a fox, or some other of those nocturnal animals which haunt our parks during the night ; but when they were repeated, I felt sure that they emanated from a human being in distress. Without further pre lude I may tell you that they emanated from the Countess of Duddlestone, alias Rose Leclerque. Astonished at finding her alone in the park at such an hour of the night, I offered to escort her back to the castle. She took my arm without saying a word, and my own instinct told me that it would be fruitless to ask her for any explanation. But the explanation was forthcoming on our arrival at the castle. Let me pass over that miserable scene. Shortly, the Countess of Duddlestone was a madwoman, and the so-called confidential servant was her keeper. The next morning my perplexity was great indeed. On the one hand I considered it to be my duty to discover if the Countess was receiving proper medical attendance. On the other \u25a0land, I was averse to obtruding my advice where it had not been asked. AVhile I was consulting with myself what course of conduct I ought to pursue, a servant arrived from the castle to ask if I could go there immediately, as the Countess wished to"], [205, "Epilogue. 197 See me, and so the messenger said, was not expected to live throughout the day. After telling him to bring up the local doctor, who had succeeded Mr. Snowdon, I hurried up to the castle. A clergyman of my age and experience is accustomed to death beds, and I saw at once that the hours of the Countess were numbered. Her dying confession and my own prayers that her sins may be forgiven her, are matters too sacred for revelation. I feel that I am only permitted by my conscience to tell you these facts. Nature had endowed her with an abnormal amount of human electricity, according to the language of modern scientists. In other words, she could influence for good or evil, those with whom she was brought in contact, in the same way as Snowdon had influenced Norah Henley. Unfortunately, this influence had been directed towards evil, notably by her brother Paul Leclerque. At the suggestion of this man, if it be possible to call him a man, she had mesmerised a waiter at the Lord AVarden Hotel at Dover, and directed him, while under her power, to assassinate the Earl of Duddlestone, so that she might gain the legitimate inheritance of the Dowager Countess, before the Earl had time to alter his will. Her influence over Snowdon, which resulted in his murder and the suicide of Norah, has, I am thankful to see, been already described in the documents which you have sent me, so that it is unnecessary for me to refer to it. How far the confession will incriminate Paul Lecierque and his accomplice Alphonse, I leave to your legal experience to judge. AVith kind regards, I am, yours sincerely, RICHARD RIDLEY.
