When Mr. Joyce first entered, Arthur had contrived to deposit a book he had been reading upon a shelf, fondly hoping his movements had escaped observation. He also dropped the short pipe into his coat pocket, congratulating himseU that it was nearly smoked out. The Greek cap likewise mysteriously disappeared. \" Come, Arthur, don't wriggle about Uke a polar bear ; sit up, and puU that filthy pipe out of your pooket ; don't you see it's buring a hole through your coat ?

He was a little taken aback, when, upon entering the drawing room, he found his uncle there. But the miller had his own reasons for inviting Mr. Joyce. Arthur's attentions had become pointed, and he thought there might be a chance during the evening of drawing him out, and finding how he was disposed toward his nephew. \" Glad to see you, uncle,\" was Arthur's salu tation ; \" though I didn't know you were a party going sweU.\" Mr. Joyce gave a grunt, which did not indicate any great satisfaction at the presence of his nephew, and then inquired who the gentleman was who had just been speaking to him. \" It's Jack Edie, uncle ; Adrian Hope knows"], [22, "14 LOST FOOTSTEPS. him very well. I'm devUish glad to have the opportunity of introducing an old pal.\" \" An old what ? \" almost screamed Mr. Joyce, who had a righteous horror of slang. \"An old chum \u2014 a devilish \u2014 in fact, an out and-out judge of art and a capital painter himself.

Fortunately for him, Mary Gabriel came up at the moment, and Mr. Joyce, having the true feeUng of a gentleman of the old school when ladies were concerned, was extremely poUte and attentive to her, the more so indeed from the fact that he considered his nephew by no means the sort of person upon whom she ought to bestow ber affections. He had determined secretly to"], [23, "15 AFTER SUPPER. shield her from the young man's attentions as much as possible until he saw a change in Arthur's conduct. The mUler lost no opportunity to converse with Mr. Joyce, though that gentleman was evidently not charmed with the companion ship. Mr. Gabriel was one of those tall, broad shouldered men, with loud coarse voices and broad vulgar humour, whose general ignorance upon subjects requiring taste and refinement, and total indifference to the feelings of others, make them so awfully oppressive to those who have sensitive nerves or are possessed of any cultivation. Mr. Gabriel was very fulsome about Arthur ; but the old connoissieur so quietly and successfuUy parried his attacks, that the mUler hardly knew what to make of him. \" To be candid with you, Mr. Gabriel,\" said he, when the mUler had put several questions of a most pointed character to him, \" my nephew's views of Use are not quite what I wish them to be.\" Mr. Gabriel received this with a fierce Ha, ha !"], [24, "16 LOST FOOTSTEPS. \" Can't put old heads upon young shoulders, my dear sir; but it's a good job when a young feUow is born with a silver spoon in his mouth, eh?

He did not wonder, perhaps, that Arthur had succeeded in ingratiating himself with Mary, for he was a good-looking and plausible feUow. Soon the mUler was near him again with many inuendoes, more expressive than delicate, about the resources of the young couple, whose future Use he had evidently settled in his own mind. \" Tou see, Mr. Joyce, things have come to such a pass that a young man hardly dares to marry unless he has decided prospects.\" \" Very true, Mr. Gabriel.\" \" And really it requfres a considerable sum now to start a young man in any business or profession.

She was so much annoyed at her father's coarse nature, that she often, as now, felt it a hard struggle to pay him the respect which she felt a parent entitled to claim.

Mary, however, was still silent, and her usual girlish cheerfulness had given way to a most womanly seriousness. Instead of replying, she burst into tears. Arthur was highly displeased at this. His past lUe, training, and companions, had not taught him the value of human nature's better impulses ; but he concealed his iU- temper as weU as he could and again inquired what had happened to dis tress her.

How swiftly she had discovered the absence of that warmth of heart, that sympathy and generous enthusiasm with which women are so easily made happy, which leads them to forgive so much, and without which they are so seldom amiable or contented, no matter how briUiant their position. She had not the chance of having misunderstood her husband, to saU back upon. Many men are singular in their manners, and complex in their natures ; and women who do not quite comprehend them at first, yet, event uaUy learn to appreciate and love them better than persons of ordinary, commonplace, every day characters.

Outwardly, perhaps, she had not so much fault to find with M. Morel. He gave her unlimited indulgence, but no sympathy. The convention aUties of the world sealed thefr lips for a time, but soon the formulas of society were such a mockery to Louise \u2014 the constant restraint so drove back her enthusiasm, and clouded over all her fresh and genial impulses, that she broke the bonds in defiance, and society began to look at her with watchful eyes, and to put its own interpretation upon her looks and manners. The impression soon became common enough that there was in reality no genuine affection on M. Morel's part. Sometimes Louise would give way to her feehngs and tempt him by a thousand little winning arts to bestow more attention upon her. She made the wUdest efforts to touch his heart, to awaken his dormant sympathies, but his feehngs seemed petrified. He grudged no outlay, he made no stipulations, he asked no concessions, he was simply indifferent; and would have been equally so to any woman in the world. He had yielded to a fancy which had never touched his"], [40, "32 LOST FOOTSTEPS. heart, and which had died out again with the possession of its object, and with the attainment of a purpose upon which he had set his mind. At another time, Louise would ascribe all the blame to his mother, who had used such persever ing efforts to bring about this union. Scores of petty tricks and man\u0153uvres she remembered now, which had escaped her notice at the moment, and as she recalled them, her indignation against Madame Morel became fiercer every moment. But there was at least this to be said for Madame. She loved her daughter-in-law, and would have done much to make her happy. Her fault had been \u2014 and a mother's fault after all \u2014 in believing better of her son than he deserved.

In this struggle of hers she had no confidant \u2014 she had so soon learnt the lesson, that romance sentiment, enthusiasm, were not to be indulged in by the world in which she moved. Warmth of heart, or passionate feeling, either occasioned surprise, or raised a smile. Rarely either did M. Morel give her the opportunity of expressing her inmost thoughts. Her gay and thoughtless manner, her witty and lively sallies, and the charm of her lovely face, had amused him for a Uttle while, and there the fascination ended.

They were spending an evening alone \u2014 a rare occurrence, and Louise had determined, after much hesitation, to claim some explanation from her husband. He had been sitting for a long time in the room, without taking any notice of her, when suddenly raising his eyes, he saw she was in tears, and asked her the cause. Louise did not immediately answer.

At one moment he was tossed in a tiny boat upon a wave that seemed mounting to the very sky; at another he was lying upon the edge of a precipice, bound hand and foot, and so near to its awful verge that he could see far down and down into a terrific abyss. His walk did not help in the least to shake off this uneasy impression, and he continued the whole day absent and melancholy.

After meditating and brooding the whole day, a thought crossed his mind which drove the blood to his heart. What if this depression should be a presentiment of evil to Louise ? Of evil which it might be in his power to avert, though apparently so entirely separated from her. This suspicion once aroused could not be aUayed.

They felt that Adrian's unhappiness would only be increased, U he discovered that the marriage of Louise had not proved a happy one ; but he was so resolved, that it seemed only to irritate him to raise any objection. At last, amidst the tears of AUce and Maude, and the deep regret of his uncle and father, he tore himself away, and was soon on his journey to Rotterdam. He reached the famiUar spot without any adventures on the way, and in the afternoon of the foUowing day was wandering in a wood that formed the boundary of M. Morel's grounds, waiting tUl dusk, at which hour an old servant had promised to gain him admittance to the chateau, and, U possible, the chance of a word or two with Louise, without interruption. The place where he lingered was not without a picturesque charm of it's own.

Weary in spirit, and fatigued in body, Adrian sat beneath one of these trees and gave himseU up for a time to a not unpleasing reverie.

In this the poetical nature is truly to be envied. Happy he who sometimes sees, however briefly, with the unshadowed light of the spiritual eye. He realises more than others can that entfre forgetfulness of past sorrow, that ideal of perfect love and unclouded happiness which we hope for in a Use to come. It was from such an ecstatic mood that the young artist aroused himself, when, hearing the turret clock of the chateau chime the hour, he re membered his appointment, and aU the hopes and anxieties connected with it. As he left the spot \u2014 the only one in the neighbourhood of Rotterdam which had any claim for an artistio eye \u2014 he"], [57, "49 A PRESENTIMENT. thought how often it must have gladdened the eyes of Louise, and, perhaps, caUed up kindly remembrances of himseU ; and he loved the spot for the influences surrounding it. Little did Adrian imagine as he sat there, through the sunny afternoon, undisturbed in his thoughts and reveries, save by the flutter or hum of a light-winged insect, the chirp of a bird, or the soft unearthly sigh of a passing breeze \u2014 little did he imagine how near, both in thought and in person, was she whose welfare was the one purpose of his Use at that moment ; still less did he conceive that the vague presentiment with which his mind had been so recently occupied, was rapidly working toward its fulfilment. In truth, at one hour of that very afternoon Louise had been seated within a hundred yards of Adrian. The servant with whom he had been in communication had warned him that he might expect a change in her. \" Not in her beauty,\" said the faithful woman \u2014 the identical round Uttle woman who seemed to have stepped from a picture of Teniers, who welcomed Adrian upon his 4 VOL.

Nothing could part her from her young mistress ; and Madame Morel, much as she objected to a rival, however humble in her influence over Louise, was fain to allow the damsel to become a fixture at the chateau. Adrian had, however, made a compact with the gfrl, that Louise might not be informed of his visit beforehand. Unwise as his determination may have been, he was resolved, if possible, to surprise her into an expression of her real feeUngs toward him, forgetting how painful and injurious such an avowal might be to herself. Adrian, as we have said, had been prepared for a change in Louise, but the girl had not revealed its extent. Indeed, the grevious disappointment, and even deception, of which Louise had been the victim, had almost imperiled her Use. She was not less beautUul than ever, but paUid, and with the traces of settled grief evidently fastened upon her features. She had been but a short time alone in the grounds of the chateau, being joined shortly after"], [59, "51 A PRESENTIMENT. leaving the house by a man of sombre aspect, who came to her side in a manner which seemed to indicate that she had been frequently watched by him. He was a man whose countenance, ascetic in its expression, was modified by a certain calmness and sweetness, which was not at all unpleasing. He had large thoughtful blue eyes, and was, one would suppose, a man of superior intellect and intelUgence. His look was fixed in a penetrating manner upon Louise, as though to ascertain with certainty her mood before approaching her. He was a priest who had been upon intimate terms with Madame Morel, who kept that most rigid observance of the externals of religion which is to be especially noticed in many Belgian families. It must be repeated that Madame was really attached to her daughter-in-law, and regretted deeply that Louise had become, since her mar riage, distant and constrained to her. Thinking that her favourite priest might, perhaps, induce Louise to place greater confidence in himself, she"], [60, "52 LOST FOOTSTEPS. had commissioned him to seek the young wife's society, and, if possible, to draw her into con versation. \" Tou are sad, my daughter.\" Louise looked up, evidently surprised at his presence, and gave vent to a deep sigh. It was caused a3 much by real Ulness as weariness of spirit. \" WUl you not confide in me ?\" asked the priest, with much gentleness. \" Tou have shown me much kindness and consideration,\" she answered, \"but it is not the custom of the faith in which I have been reared to unburden the secrets of the heart to the priest.\" \" They do well who seek the consolation of the Church in their difficulties and trials. What can relieve the oppressed spirit so readily as to pour out its sorrows and to receive the Church's kindly absolution ? \" \" Not iu the form in which you offer it to me.

The priest was a man of real feeUng, and but for the tenets of his Church might have advised her well ; but feeUng that h;is influence would only be weakened by persistence, he withdrew, though the evident weakness of Louise made him do so unwUlingly. She had been tempted by the fineness of the afternoon to go into the open-air \u2014 the first time she had done so for several days. She was weak and ill, and her physician had cautioned her against exertion ; and now,: being left alone, she was alarmed to find herseU hardly capable of reaching the chateau again. In the hope, how ever, that some one might pass through one of the footpaths near at hand, she sat down and waited."], [62, "54 LOST FOOTSTEPS. But the strange oppression and weakness still continued. It was a kind of illness that was to her unaccountable. She was free from pain, and had a certain hazy consciousness of things around her ; but there was such an unreality, something so vague and intangible in the appearance of all she saw, that she imagined herself to be sinking into a swoon. However, she became no worse, only losing all power over herseU ; she could make no more effort to speak, or raise an alarm, than if she had been dumb from her birth; and her limbs were equaUy destitute of nervous power. She sat there as though chained to the seat, unable to move, or give the slightest sign of her con dition, and only saved from falling by the attitude in which she had been sitting. While she sat thus, the shadow of a man was thrown by the sunlight across a vista at a short distance. He was walking slowly, with his eyes fixed upon the distant chateau. The slightest sound would have reached his ears \u2014 almost a whisper would have attracted his attention, for the afternoon was divinely stUl, and there was not"], [63, "55 A PRESENTIMENT. the faintest echo of traffic within hearing. The sight of him was a terrible shock to Louise in her weakly state of health, and she made an effort to cry out, but her voice failed her, and she lost consciousness entirely with Adrian's name upon her Ups, and Adrian himself passing so near, that with a few steps' advance she might have touched him. A few moments later, one of the servants passed from the chateau and discovered her. She was carried into the house, and a physician sent for ; but for hours Louise remained in the same state of stupor. The servant met Adrian with this sad intelli gence, and the young painter felt that all hope of seeing her at present was at an end. Tet he determined to remain for some days in the neigh bourhood of Rotterdam, trusting to her speedy recovery. When reason slowly returned, she had a dim recoUection of having seen Adrian; but in the confused state of her faculties, found it impossible to remember under what circumstances, and"], [64, "56 LOST FOOTSTEPS. concluded that it must have been but a vivid dream. Tet the impression lingered in her mind, and caused her, when recovering a little, to ask for writing materials, to communicate with her father. \" Madame must not agitate herself,\" said the physician, \" or I wUl not answer for the conse- quences. Louise, however, determined to write, and commenced the letter thus : \u2014 \" I have had a sudden and strange attack of an Ulness, such as I never before experienced. At the moment when it seized me, I was sitting in the grounds. Whether it is only the effect of my diseased imagination, I do not know ; but it appeared to me, that the young artist, Mr. Adrian Hope, who resided a short time with us, passed through the park. It may be, and prob ably is, nothing more than a mere fancy of mine ; but U it should happen that he is here, and calls upon you, beg bim by every kind feeUng that he once professed for me, not to come near the chateau any more."], [65, "57 A PRESENTIMENT. \" Tou will wonder, my dear father, why I am so urgent upon this point ; but I have special reasons for being so.

It is useless to widen the gulf existing between us by any appearance of encouraging Mr. Hope's visits, therefore, should it happen that he has really been here, I wish him to know, that he will only add to my unhappiness by coming here again. \" At the same time, I feel it is no injus tice to my husband to say that the happy days Mr. Hope spent with us I shall never forget .\" The letter was unfinished, for the effort to write it caused a relapse, and M.

Whether Louise had any consciousness respect ing her unfinished letter, it was impossible to say ; but once she moved her lips, and half opened her eyes as though she would have spoken to her husband. Whatever she wished to say, the effort was in vain, and she sank back exhausted with a tremulous motion of the lips, and a faint sigh. Her husband did not regard her with much appearance of feeling, though evidently astonished at the suddenness of the attack. If any self reproach agitated him \u2014 if during the few moments he watched at her bedside, and saw her apparently hovering between life and death, he may have remembered, with any compunction, the coldness and indifference with which he had treated her so soon after their marriage \u2014 he did not show it, and was as calm and impassive as ever.

He picked it up, glanced at it hastily, and, with a look of determination, foreign to his usual manner, put it in his pocket. The physician seemed surprised at his coldness, but he had often been present where great self command had also been allied to the deepest devotion, and imagined that the forced calmness of M. Morel would probably give way when alone. Soon poor Mynheer Kalm arrived, and his almost childish tenderness was a wonderful con- trast to the indifference of his son-in-law. Mynheer, it is true, asked no questions, made no remarks, or suggestions; but the anxious gaze with which he sat looking at his beloved daughter, with occasionally the sight of a big tear rolling down his placid cheeks, proved that the old Dutchman, if his grief found little vent in speech, was very earnest in his affection. Not one word did Guillaume Morel say of the letter, though it was addressed to Mynheer, and Adrian, therefore, never received the intended warning."], [68, "60 LOST FOOTSTEPS. M.

If he had shown great devotion towards her, this would have occasioned little surprise ; but Guillaume, for reasons of his own, seemed especially anxious that no interview should take place between Louise and Adrian. He enquired of the priest who had conversed with his young wife in the grounds \u2014 of the servants who had brought her into the house ; but all declared that Adrian had not been near the spot, and M.

The new comer, a man of experience, seemed really alarmed when he arrived and ascertained particulars. Evidently his opinion was, that Louise was rapidly sinking, and this idea was confirmed by the other physician, who, after watching her closely for a lengthened period, declared that the pulsation was decreasing.

The physicians shook their heads as they con ferred together, and at the same moment M. Morel entered the room softly. \" Is there any chance that Madame may soon recover ? \" he enquired, in an under-tone. \" There is always hope,\" answered the physician evasively, \" but Monsieur must not be too sanguine.\" \" It is very strange, this attack,\" said M, Morel dubiously, \" Madame had no positive iUness a few days ago. She was depressed in spirits, but did not complain of actual ill-health.\" \" I should imagine,\" said the physician, \" that some secret mental anxiety had greatly influenced madame.

This temperament, so interesting in happy and prosperous situations, so prone to despairing wretchedness, under unfavourable conditions, was exactly that of her mother, and was probably, as we so often see in families, increased to excess in her offspring.

The devotion of her father had scarcely allowed her a single unhappy moment. She had grown up from a child, sur rounded by genial influences. To her, care had been an unknown word, and it seemed not unlikely that the suggestion of the physician had consider able truth in it, and that the physical prostration of the young wife was due, in a great measure, to the intense mental excitement she was labouring under. A day or two passed, and Louise still remained in the same lethargic condition, the physician visiting her daily, and perceiving no change. At length, upon one occasion, the physician who had first attended her called the attention of the other to the fact, that his patient was pulseless, and that her breathing was no longer perceptible. Without a pang, without a sigh, she appeared to have passed into the silent land. \" Madame is no more,\" he said, in a whisper, \" call M.

When Guillaume Morel came, the physician anticipated a painful scene, but no such result took place ; M.

He was agitated, but that soon passed away ; and he asked in a low tone, \" Have you ascertained beyond all doubt that Madame is dead ?

The little servant, who was so tenderly attached to Louise, contrived to convey this sad intelligence to Adrian, wno nad been daily in secret to enquire if there was any change.

It was to hear this that he had come to Rotterdam so suddenly ; and he asked himself gloomily was it only of misery that men ever received a forewarning ? were sorrow, disappointment, and death, the only events that cast theh shadows before, and never prosperity, happiness, and love ? \" Too late ! \" was the only echo to this des pairing cry."], [77, "CHAPTER VI. The Sorrows of Mynheer Kalm. The sorrows of Mynheer Kalm were of a totally different character from the sorrows of Werter. Let us hope the reader will not object to hear how Mynheer bore them. The loss of his beloved daughter seemed for a time utterly to paralyze the business qualities of the merchant. Kloots, left to his own devices, smothered his grief in his old manner. Every crane and windlass was at a standstill. Not a waggon turned a wheel, and the bargemen smoked and swore for want of occupation. It was a lamentable state of things, and Kloots shook his head almost as solemnly as his master, when he thought of the future. What if Mynheer, over come with his sad loss, never more bargained for those mighty piles, and retired from business !"], [78, "70 LOST FOOTSTEPS. The thought was too horrible, and Kloots took another glass of Schiedam and scouted it enthely. Our present picture of Mynheer is taken while that gentleman is rusticating in his summer house, his infallible retreat from all those His of mortality, which, not being curable, must be made endurable. He has been sitting for a long time silent and motionless, when he arouses himself, raises his head, and shakes it gently, with the old characteristic movement familiar to us in happier days. He is making an effort to shake off his overpowering emotion. But consolation is as yet far from him; as he rose slowly and surveyed his favourite tulip bed, and taking up a watering pot which lay near him, walked at a funeral pace over the lawn, smooth and level as a billiard table, and came to the fish pond, in which was the wonderful house of shells described aforetime.

The gold and silver fish swarmed in hundreds to the surface of the pool, leaping out of the water, as though with a desire to console their bereaved master. Mynheer regarded them sadly ; filled his watering pot and watered his tulips sedately \u2014 as, of course, Mynheer would. When he had done this, he went back to the edge of the fish pond, aud with one hand in his pocket, clutched the watering pot convulsively with the other, stood (not like Niobe, who, by the way, was a lady, and not a native of Holland) \u2014 Mynheer, let us merely say, stood by the margin of his fish pond and wept. He had forgotten everything but his great grief, and, though he had not missed feeding his fish for twenty years, it was evident that he was enthely oblivious to their expectations. In vain did the gold and silver fish dart gaily to and fro. They apparently could not understand why they should go short of theh accustomed meal ; but Mynheer only contemplated them abstractedly, and in his melanoholy reverie, even his watering pot dropped unknowingly from"], [80, "72 LOST FOOTSTEPS. his hand. After a time he roused himself with a sigh, with dehberate steps retraced his path to the summer-house, filled his meerschaum, and sat down. Onoe more the unhappy man gave himself up to a reverie, leaning his head upon his hand wearily, as though needing repose. For some time, his eyes wandered unsteadily from one object to another, and a slight twitching could be per ceived at intervals about his mouth, as though he had been conversing in imagination with some absent friend. Ere long, Mynheer's countenance assumed its wonted placidity ; his wearied eyelids sank \u2014 rose again only to sink more slowly and heavily than before \u2014 deeper and deeper still, and lo, a deep sleep had faUen upon him.

This was the dream that came in the slumber of Mynheer, a dream of Louise, as he had seen her but a few summers ago. Tonder, upon the smoothly shaven lawn, springs forward a youthful maiden chasing a butterfly, with a delicately worked fan. Ah, how well he remembers that fan with its beautifuUy carved ivory work, and its prettily painted grotesque figures. Did not his dear old neighbour Vanderbeck bring it from Japan, and make it a present to his darhng Louise upon her fifteenth birthday ?

Her arms are raised \u2014 she scarcely touches the ground \u2014 with what a joyous bound she tries to reach the gaudy fluttering insect above her head, which seems by its capricious movements as though it compre hended her object, and enjoyed her ineffectual attempts to capture it. And there he sat, the father of this enchanting"], [82, "74 LOST FOOTSTEPS. creature, watching her every movement with a sensation of delight, to which the rapture of poet and painter could be but feebly com pared. How many times his meerschaum had gone out during that butterfly chase, is not to be told. At length, flushed and tired, she is seated by his side in the summer-house, laughing with fairylike glee at her want of success, and pointing out to him the butterfly escaping in triumph to the opposite side of the canal, there to be immolated under the greasy cap of a bargeman. What a beautiful child she was, and giving evidence in every look and attitude of a still more delightful womanhood. Flitting like this in the sunlight had robbed her skin of its transparent hue ; but there was the ruddy glow, and exquisite colour to counterbalance it. Angel or fairy, which should he call her, as she gazed after the fluttering insect? It was exhilerating, it was infectious. He would go and chase a butterfly himseU.

A severe internal struggle agitated the bosom of Mynheer Kalm. His countenance, so far as it was capable of expression, revealed a look of disappointment and despair, when he awoke and sought vainly for his absent child. Meanwhile, he took from his pocket a miniature, gazed at it abstractedly \u2014 shook his head \u2014 replaced it in his pocket, and then seemed to have come to some important conclusion. In fact, remembered at that moment that he had not seen Kloots since the previous day. A raft would, in all probability, arrive at the wharf; and should his manager, under the influence of excessive grief, indulge in deeper potations than usual, there was a chance that he might lose a very excel lent bargain.

He endeavoured, when he was calmer, to bribe the servant who secretly brought him the news, to admit him at once to the chateau, but he was told that M. Morel had given such decided orders that no one was to see Louise, without his special sanction, that he would be under the risk of not seeing hor at all, if he did not wait till the time she had named.

He had not yet visited Mynheer Kalm, and kept clear of the town, for in his excited state the sudden clash of a passing vehicle, or the clank of machinery near at hand, jarred upon his nerves with positive pain. He wandered out into the woods in the neighbourhood of the chateau, for upon his artistic temperament the sweet blending of natural sounds always had a soothing effect. The tones that reached him there were subdued by distance, and lost all harshness. If the lowing of oxen in some farm-yard hidden by clumps of trees, or the sharp bark of a dog fell upon his ear, they were blended with other sounds, and produced a natural harmony. If the bell of a distant steeple clanged the hour, the tone rose and fell upon the breeze, swelling and dying into a mysterious murmur, which seemed indefinitely prolonged, till he discovered it was but the buzz of a passing bee, who seemed trying to rival the lingering tones of the bell. If a bird hovered above him with its carol long and loud in the clear atmosphere,"], [87, "79 IN THE TWILIGHT. the ear seemed immediately prepared for it. If Adrian had spent the day in the town, the aggravation of the noise and bustle would have tendered him utterly incapable of keeping his appointment. As it was, when the declining sun warned him to return, he was much calmer, much more resigned, than a few hours before he would have thought possible. The faithful girl contrived to meet him at the spot agreed upon, and conducted him with much caution into the chateau. Often as Adrian had visited there, he was unfamiliar with the winding passages and galleries through which he now passed, and, obedient to the instructions of his guide, he noted every peculiarity of the place, having agreed, to save the risk of disgrace to the servant, to return alone. Although scarcely dark in the open air, it was aheady dusk in the dimly-lighted rooms and corridors of the antique building, and the gloom was in creased by the lofty trees with which the chateau was nearly surrounded. Dreading discovery at every moment, the ghl"], [88, "80 LOST FOOTSTEPS, was compelled to light a small lamp, and bidding Adrian keep at such a distance behind her that he could easily fall back in case of other servants approaching, they silently and cautiously reached, without interruption, the chamber of death. It was almost with a sense of rehef that Adrian stood at length in the presence of his lost love. His intolerable agitation during the day had reached its climax, when he came to keep his appointment in the grounds of the chateau. His feelings had been strained to the utmost, and it was with a passionate emotion, almost, one might say, with a certain joy that he felt a stronger hand than that of a merely human rival had snatched Louise horn him now. There she lay, wonderfully quiet, wonderfully calm, as if, by accident, he had entered the chamber and found her sleeping.

Full of the solemn thoughts of one, who, for the first time in bis life, is in the presence of the great Mystery, he sat down, placing the tiny lamp in such a position that its light fell upon the marble face of the dead. He must have sat there a considerable time, for the servant who admitted him came to warn him, fearing that ho would be discovered. But sho found him so lost in thought, with his face fixed in such a stony gaze upon her dead mistress, that it was impossible to rouse him without making considerable noise ; and with the superstition of her sex and country, she feared to speak above a whisper in that awful presence.

Unconscious that the ghl had ever entered the chamber, unconscious that his lamp was getting dim, and that the feeble twilight had deepened into dark night, Adrian might have sat there, immovable as a statue, fill the breaking dawn, but for an event, so removed from everyrday experience \u2014 so marvellous \u2014 so unexpected, that, but for authenticated narratives of similar incidents, it might well be denied credence. Adrian had placed the lamp, as we have said, so that its gleam fell upon the pallid face of Louise. Its flickering light, waving from time to time across the features, imparted a strange appearance of life to the face, which awed, yet fascinated, the young painter. He had watched this strange effect so long, that at first he was not aware that the eyes of the dead lady were no longer closed.

Petrified with horror, some minutes elapsed before he was able to stir. Then, how he kept his senses in that terrible crisis \u2014 how he man aged to command his faculties, so as to be capable of thought or action \u2014 how he succeeded in bear ing from the chateau the form of his beloved Louise, and depositing it safely in the apartment he had hired in the outskirts of Rotterdam \u2014 may seem almost a miracle.

Well has it been said of old, and with a deeper insight into a great truth, and a wider application than any heathen doctrine could have foreseen, \" that to the pure heart and the bold hand the blessed Immortals are swift.\" Circumstances which so seldom favour the deeds of ordinary life, excepting some rare instances, which then seem invested with a sacredness that takes from our minds the impression of chance \u2022in this case favoured Adrian."], [92, "84 LOST FOOTSTEPS. The fact that the servant had pointed out a secluded way of leaving the house was fortunate for him, in the first place ; and having aheady gained a familiarity with the grounds of the chateau, he suddenly remembered a spot, whero by climbing a low wall, he would have the best chance of escaping. Flying without another moment's consideration, with his precious burden in his arms, he arrived at the spot with no interruption. Some large boughs had been lopped from the trees which overhung this wall, and by piling them against it, he easily made a rude kind of ladder. The clock of the chateau startled him by striking nine, as he climbed over the wall, breathless with his exertions, but full of confi dence, and feeling perfectly justified in his own conscience for the act he had committed. It was a lonely road that led from the rear of the grounds, and not a soul was within sight ; but he felt that he could not trust to the chanco of not meeting anyone, and the risk of discovery and pursuit, would, of course,"], [93, "85 IN THE TWILIGHT. increase every moment. In this dilemma he heard with delight the rumble of wheels, and saw an empty market cart approaching. Simply telling the driver that his sister had been taken ill, he induced the driver to carry him within a hundred yards of his lodging, then, while the cart went rumbling on at a snail's pace, he nimbly lifted out the inanimate form, and in a few seconds reached his own door. It was opened by his old landlady, carrying a light in her hand. Before she had time to watch his movements Adrian had blown it out. \" Ha ! the wind is fierce to night,\" cried the dame. \"Stay a moment, dear sh, and I will get another light.\" \" No matter ; I can easily find my way,\" answered Adrian, dashing past her in the dark ness, and then coming down again himself immediately. The hght procured, he watched Louise for a moment with intense anxiety. Insensibility still continued ; yet he fancied he could detect a faint breathing. But what gave him the greatest"], [94, "86 LOST FOOTSTEPS. uneasiness was the extreme rigidity of her limbs. He was fearfully agitated, not knowing if it could really be life that had occasioned the strange movement of the eyelids. His position was terribly embarrassing, from the fact that he must trust entirely to his own slender knowledge of medicine for aid. Clammy drops of perspiration stood upon his forehead as he watched the couch, and administered, as well as he was able, a simple restorative, which was fortunately at hand, and which, with trembling eagerness, he poured between the rigid lips. No real animation had, as yet, taken place. There was barely so much life discernible, as that which, in some of the less developed forms of nature, has puzzled the scientific student. Remaining alone at such a moment, when the aid of an experienced physician might, perhaps, snatch his idol from the ioy clasp of death, was, in itself, maddening enough to try the steadiest nerves. But dared he make a confidant? He felt not. He must trust to himself alone."], [95, "87 IN THE TWILIGHT. Tet not alone enthely \u2014 his heart grew lighter with the thought, and hope returned. He who had given his darhng life, had power to inter pose between that life and the blackness of death; and to Him, with fervent heart, Adrian appealed. In another moment he detected a change, but so faint and indefinite, that but for the micro scopic glance constantly directed toward the beloved object, it would not have been perceived. Adrian fancied that there was a little more expression in Louise's eyes. From the first moment that he imagined she really breathed he had watched them constantly ; but the dreadful glassy stare \u2014 which could only be compared to that of somnambulism, or some peculiar forms of incipient disease of the brain \u2014 6till continued. As they appeared when they first opened, so they still remained ; but the lids trembled slightly, as though with a ten dency to close.

It was the first satisfactory token \u2014 the first tangible evidence \u2014 that life was graduaUy returning to the enfeebled frame. In the midst of his great joy, he stiU re membered that life, if to be won back at all, must be wooed with extreme gentleness. If death had not actually seized Louise in his unrelaxing grasp, she had been so near the confines of his grim domain, that the least inadvertence would render up to the King of Terrors what almost seemed his lawful prey. At this moment \u2014when Adrian, from nervous agitation, was unable to leave the couch, or quit his grasp of the icy hand \u2014 a thought passed through his mind which was like a revelation. He had heard much of the powers of mesmerism \u2014 had heard its effects attested by men whose opinions would appear unquestion able, yet he had always ridiculed it \u2014 perhaps, because of the extravagant virtues assigned to it in some quarters. He had frequently tried to mesmerize his friends, but always with no effect, and had been told that he did not"], [97, "IN THE TWILIGHT. 89 attempt the experiment with sufficient earnest ness and force of will to produce any result. It would be strange, indeed, if any effort of of the wiU were wanting now. Accordingly, he stood up, and, throwing, as it were, the ut most force of his soul into the mechanical movement of his arms, he made a few passes. The effect was miraculous ! a sudden flutter ing motion \u2014 a slight spasm \u2014 and then, gradually, softly, and without effort, the eyelids closed. But now came the alarming thought. What could have been the strange malady from which Louise had suffered? From all appear ances it seemed that the unfortunate lady had been for the last two or three days in a state of catalepsy. If so, what relation might mes merism have with such a condition ? Was it not probable that the effort of his strong will at such a moment, over a weak and exhausted frame, if it had any influence at all, would increase the very disorder, if so it could be called ? Hour after hour passed away, and there was"], [98, "90 LOST FOOTSTEPS. no further change. There was still a very faint breathing \u2014 so faint, indeed, that Adrian often feared it had ceased altogether. He would have placed a mirror to her lips, but, looking round the bare and poorly furnished room, he was reminded that there was no such thing in the place. Then he remembered the glass which covered a portrait of Louise, which he always carried with him ; that would answer the purpose. With deep emotion he drew it from his pocket, and held it to her lips for some time, but the exceeding faintness of her breath, together with the warm atmosphere, prevented it from being tarnished. He waited a httle longer, and again tried the effect. There was now a slight moisture \u2014 her own portrait was dimmed by her own breath. Strange contrast ! Death, then, was still kept at bay, and he fancied, as he still held Louise's hand, that it had lost, in some degree, the icy coldness which it had when he first brought her into the room."], [99, "CHAPTER VIII. Hoping against Hope What an effort it cost Adrian to be calm at that moment? but he dared not be otherwise. The slightest attempt to hasten the gradual restoration of nature might be fatal. He felt quite assured of that; but the moments passed like ages while he waited. It seemed to him as though he might have rescued Louise years ago, so remote the time appeared since the moment when he beheved her dead \u2014 so violent had been his transitions of feeling and emotion during that time. The extreme stillness of the place, and of the night, favoured speedy detection of any change that took place. He continued to watch earnestly until the grey dawn broke slowly, and some faint signs of animation and"], [100, "92 LOST FOOTSTEPS, echoes of traffic could be heard in the sluggish city. At length, so gradually, that the difference could only be noticed in the course of several hours, a faint warmth was to be discerned in the limbs, and Adrian even fancied that a shadowy tinge of colour could be seen in her cheeks. Now, if life were really coming back again, how to prevent the chance of a reaction was the great difficulty. If Louise should so far recover con sciousness as to be able to recognize him by the coming daylight, how could he answer for the state of mind such a recognition might induce ? Here he raised an imaginary difficulty. Had he been calm enough to consider the subject well, he would have felt, that in such a state of mind and body as that to which Louise had been reduced, she would not be likely, for some time yet, to recognize him, much less to analyze her feehngs, or be impressed by any vivid emotions. The utmost that appeared likely, was, that for some time, at least, she would barely be"], [101, "HOPING AGAINST HOPE. 93 able to comprehend her condition, and very unlikely to have any distinct recollection of her past life. A very hazy and indistinct conception of events, would, in all likelihood, be presented to her mind. Thus, nature, in her weakness and loss of mental power, would act as her own restorer. Some feeling of this kind began to influence Adrian after a time, and convinced him that his only course was to wait with pa tience and fortitude, while nature was doing her own work. Tet, what rapid alternations of fear, hope, horror, and anxious expectation, passed through his mind as he sat there. And not only respecting the actual time was he agitated. As he saw Louise slowly gaining strength \u2014 as he saw some slight indications of returning mental power, he began to ask himself what should he do next ? If she recovered, could he induce her to fly with him to England, and not return to her husband, or some of her immediate friends ? Suppose, too, she decided to como with him to England, how would he be able to defeat the prying curiosity of a country"], [102, "94 LOST FOOTSTEPS. viUage ? How would he account to his relatives there for the presence of Louise, without ex plaining the whole circumstances of this mar vellous incident, perhaps, after all, only to be doubted by those nearest and dearest to him ? That he would tamely resign Louise again after this event was quite out of the question. Circumstances had strangely intermingled theh destiny, and, come what would, he determined never more to allow any influence he might possess over her to be weakened. A daring thought passed through his mind, only to be dismissed at once. For a second it had seemed feasible that in the seclusion of a quiet, rural village, he might, after the trials she had undergone, induce her to become his wife; but his naturally firm principles would not admit more than a passing idea of such a course. The day had fully dawned, and, looking at Louise again, Adrian was surprised to see her open her eyes \u2014 not with that glassy, unfathom able stare which had filled him with horror on the previous night. Now, her eyes had some"], [103, "95 HOPING AGAINST HOPE. speculation in them. She was evidently getting stronger every hour. The blood circulated, and there was a definite colour showing in her cheeks ; but the fearful doubt in Adrian's mind had not passed away. When he saw her rapidly regaining consciousness he feared it might not last, \" A few minutes, or at most, hours, and then, perhaps, my love may be lost to me for ever,\" was the secret thought of the anxious lover. It was like standing upon the brink of a gulf, into which a sudden light had shone, and revealed its full depth and horror. Overcome by the intensity of his passionate regret, he was ready to lavish reproaches upon the inanimate ghl, for having spurned his love. Then, in another moment, melted into tenderness and pity at sight of the forlorn figure, lying there so still and helpless, he stooped down and imprinted a kiss upon her paUid Ups. Whatever magic there might have been in the touch, or in what way it may have coincided with the half-dreaming fancies passing through her brain, she could never teU at any future time ;"], [104, "96 LOST FOOTSTEPS. but Adrian, leaving her side with trembling anxiety, was startled to hear his own name pro nounced immediately afterwards. The terror which he had all along felt, lest his movemonts should have been watched, and the deed discovered, now increased with tenfold in tensity. At the first sound he hardly dared to hope that it could have been uttered by Louise, but beheved \u2014 especially as the tone was faint and indistinct \u2014 that it was spoken by some one out side the room. He opened the door with great hesitation and caution, and peered anxiously down the deep and gloomy stairs, expecting to see some one flitting away, whose curiosity had been detected ; or else, perhaps, an officer of justice waiting to arrest him. Neither sound nor sight met his listening ear or eager glance, and he turned back into the chamber, behoving himseh the dupe of his own imagination. He had softly closed the door, congratulating himself upon having kept his own secret, and not having called either upon Mynheer Kalm,"], [105, "97 HOPING AGAINST HOPE.

Suddenly, his name \u2014 the christian name this time \u2014 was spoken, and then, for the first time, came tho idea that it proceeded from Louise. He ran to her with passionate eagerness ; but though he stooped over her, watched, waited, and listened for a repetition of the sound, it was not repeated, and he began to despair. He could only now beheve that a serious relapse had taken plaoe, and that Louise would not recover.

So passed the whole of this terrible day. His landlady, wondering, knocked for him at noon, but he called through the door that he was unwell, and preferred to lie in bed. Evening came with a rich glow of sunlight upon the water and through the trees, tinged with the meUow hues of autumn.

And it was the operas \u2014 especiaUy the operas where a ballet was introduced, that most deUghted Arthur. He was not indifferent to the glories of a pantomime, and he could even sit out what he denominated \"one of the unapproachable BUl's tragedies \" at Old Drury ; but never did the young gentleman feel himseU better satisfied with his entertainment, than when seated in the half crown gaUery of Her Majesty's, with, perhaps, Mario, Grisi, Alboni, and Lablache \u2014 we are writing of the happy days when 6uch an event was possible \u2014 in the opera, and a ballet to foUow.

Determined to find out UzeUi's object, the young men waited some little time at a distance before theh curiosity was gratified.

Arthur laughed immoderately \u2014 he could laugh heartily' \u2014 it was one of his redeeming points. \" Now, who would have thought it ? \" he cried, when he had recovered his breath ; \" sly old fox he must be.\" Of course they had put the worst construction upon the professor's conduct, (how Uttle they understood him), and Edie, putting on an ex pression of mock morahty, said \u2014 \" I hesitate, Arthur, whether I shall continue my studies under UzelU after this revelation.

Meanwhile, the simple-minded artist, careless about appearances, and only anxious to foUow out an artistic idea, was merely seeking an effect for a scene from the \" Tempest,\" and had no Uttle trouble to obtain the model he sought. The class of girls he could readily obtain were coarse and unspiritual in the extreme. By the merest chance he had turned into the opera after a fagging day in his studio, and lo ! there was a revelation for him \u2014 the Ariel he had been dreaming of for six months, he now felt he could reahse in almost as many minutes. He furtively took out of his pocket an old letter and sketched the attitude of a quiet Uttle coryphee, who leaned against a paste board rock, apparently the least important member of the troupe, but in Uzelh's eyes a very sylph. He dreaded the action of the scene changing, lest he should fail to secure that exquisite figure and attidude ; and the next instant, when the enthu siastic old man looked up, she had vanished."], [120, "112 LOST FOOTSTEPS. The drop scene had faUen, and shut out the delightful vision. In two minutes the impetuous professor was at the stage door ; but the stage doorkeeper was an immovable man. In vain did UzelU tickle the palm of that severe janitor with half a sovereign \u2014 \" No, he'd see the gent \u2014 somewhere \u2014 first.\" \" Mine Got, I don't vant a harem,\" cried the excited painter, \" but ze Uttle beauty in ze pink and white skirt, wiz a flower in de centre of de forehead.\" \" I should strongly advise a gent at your time of Use,\" said the doorkeeper, winking at a potboy, who had just arrived with a jorum of \" heavy wet,\" \" to go home to bed, and mind you don't ketch cold.\" But the painter was resolute, and would probably have speedhy got himseU turned out, had not CecUy at that moment passed on her way underneath the stage, where, upon a bank of coral, or something of the sort, she was to rise through a trap door as a Naiad in the next scene. UzeUi was raving at the doorkeeper in his"], [121, "uzelli's new model. 113 broken Enghsh, as she appeared ; embeUishing his harangue with a variety of French and German expletives, and making the potboy almost choke with laughter. There was something in his manner which at once reminded Cecily, she hardly knew in what way, of Adrian. She remembered, afterwards, a description he had given her of the professor when he had once written to her ; and, to UzeUi's huge deUght, came forward and invited him to speak with her under the stage. There was some little time to spare before the next act of the ballet, and the oddly assorted pair, in those few minutes, began a friendship which was never broken again. Moved by the professor's simplicity, and gentleness of character, notwithstanding the impetuosity of his manner, she told him her little history; and from that moment, UzeUi determined to take her from the stage, and adopt her as his own child. The fearless girl, strong in her own purity, trusted the quaint old painter implicitly ; and when the ballet was over, met him at the door, VOL.

Not a wink of sleep did UzeUi get that night ; but, to the great disgust and astonishment of his housekeeper, nearly turned the house topsy-turvy. He rejected her offers of assistance \u2014 indeed, it was only by stealth the old lady could ever manage to clean up his room. \" No ! mine Got,\" cried UzeUi, \" zat woman would polish a Murillo wiz a brickbat ; \" so, tiU daylight the painter worked Uke a horse, and the perspiration stood like rain drops upon his faee. At one moment he would seize a lot of broken casts \u2014 arms, legs, heads, and busts \u2014 and pitch them pell-mell into the cupboard. In another instant, he might be seen upon his hands and knees, scraping up patches of paint from the"], [123, "uzelli's new model. 115 floor ; then, with his mahl-stick, making a vigorous onslaught upon a colony of spiders, would almost blind himself with dust ; stopping, between whUes, to rub the corner of some smoke begrimed picture, and nod his head pleasantly over a fine bit of colouring, or a well-drawn figure. What with scraping, sorting, brushing, rubbing, and arranging, the study presented by daylight the next morning, the most wonderful transforma tion imaginable. When the housekeeper came to get the professor's breakfast, she found him asleep upon an old sofa, where he had dropped down, thoroughly tired out, not having gone to bed at aU. She was not so much astonished at that, for UzelU would many a time paint aU night when he had not pleased himself with his day's work. Her surprise was caused by the neat, and even elegant appearance of the transformed study. For the painter, when he pleases, can generally produce ten times the effect, with ordinary materials, that the mere upholsterer can achieve."], [124, "116 LOST FOOTSTEPS. \"Dere vil be a young lady here at eleven, madame,\" said UzeUi, waking up to the welcome clatter of the breakfast equipage. The housekeeper sniffed a little at this intelli gence. She had been several years in Uzelli's service ; \" but them models she could'nt abide \u2014 shameless hussies.\" \" Ze young lady vil stay wiz me most likely,\" continued the painter, as though this remarkable change in his domestic arrangements was nothing out of the ordinary course. But the worthy dame had aheady taken the alarm. Uzelli's midnight labours, coupled with the announcement he had just made, would have been too much for most housekeepers. The good lady, with simpering accents, requested the painter to \"suit himself that day month ; \" and refreshing herself with a flood of tears, closed the door with a bang. \" Vat have I done to ze old fool ? \" muttered the professor, shrugging his shoulders; but forgetting the scene entirely in another five minutes, as with delighted eyes he pulled out the"], [125, "uzelli's new model. 117 old letter upon which he had sketched Cecily's portrait ; then with a cup of boihng coffee in his left hand, from which he sipped occasionally, and a brush fuU of moist juicy colour in his right, he outlined a dainty Ariel in the centre of his scene from the \" Tempest,\" and laughed outright with almost clhldish pleasure. His exultation knew no bounds, when he saw how exquisitely the face and figure of Cecily were adapted to the subject. The picture upon which he was now engaged, had been one of those he had sent to an important exhibition ; and whUe two of the pictures had been hung, and both of them sold, the picture upon which he had expended the greatest time and talent, was considered a failure. UzeUi was in a perfect frenzy when it came back to him. \" By ze Lord, Mr. Shoyce,\" said he passionately, \" I vh paint no more \u2014 I vh gif him up \u2014 I vh be a fat sheezemonger \u2014 Rejected ! \" 0 now for ever. .Farevell ze tranquil mind ! farevell content, Farevell ze lovely colour and big canvas, Zat make ambition virtue !

His Ariel, though weU enough drawn, was not the Ariel of Shakespeare ; and the old painter, with the patience and courage of a young student, determined to put the picture aside, till he could find a model realizing something Uke the grace and purity of the great poet's exquisite conception. Cecily came, and UzeUi made a rapid sketch, first of all for his cherished Ariel, then another for a picture of some tragical incident. Cechy was horrified when she saw the likeness of herseU in the latter subject ; and naively enquired, could she possibly have looked so ugly as that ? \"Ah, ma chere, don't you see it is but ze features I have copied ; as for ze expression, zat is anozer sing ; but de Uttle maid shall be as beauti ful as she please, in de picture yonder ; de more losely aU ze better.\" CecUy, looking at the \"Tempest\" scene, saw aheady a very faithful outline of herseU upon the canvas; the result of the professor's three hours' hard work before she came."], [127, "uzelli's new model. 119 And weU, indeed, was that face worthy of his labour, with its broad sah open brow, its large bright blue eyes, its delicate roseate skin, golden hah, and ruddy Ups, which, parted, revealed teeth Uke pearls. Never before had UzeUi painted such a face and figure, and he almost worshipped it. In a dreaming reverie, he saw before him, the long Une of Ulustrioua heroines he would paint in the future. \" Mary Queen of Scots.\" \" Margaret from Faust.\" \"OpheUa.\" \"Titania.\" \"Desde mona.\" Scenes from Byron, from Coleridge, and other famous poets ; until he forgot the waiting and wondering girl, who, placed in an attidude by the painter, began to feel tired aheady. \" Ah, de poor leetle maid,\" cried UzeUi, suddenly awaking from his day dream. \" I had forgotten. Sit down, my dear, and rest, and you shaU take just a nice glass of wine, and zen, mine Got, vat an Ariel we shaU see.\" UzeUi was a great beUever in immediate effect ; and would never, if he could help it, draw his subjects first upon the canvas. He would always, when possible, paint them in at once ; the conse-"], [128, "120 LOST FOOTSTEPS. quence was, that he frequently repainted them again and again. Even now, whUe CecUy was sitting before him, some slight change in her attitude, or expression, struck him ; and in a moment he rushed to the picture, and rubbed vigorously at the wet colour till the graceful Ariel had enthely vanished. CecUy, almost alarmed at this strange conduct, thought she had offended him, by not remaining long enough in the position in which he had placed her at first, and began to apologize. \" Ah, no, no, my dear, it vas not zat \u2014 it vas \u2014 Mon Dieu, I don't know vat it vas, indeed ; but some sing vas wrong. And now, U you vh stand like you stood against de bank, in ze scene at de opera, I vil paint Ariel once more.\" Most heartUy the professor went to work, chatting between whUes with CecUy, and asking her questions of her past Ihe. She had aheady told him how she had gained some knowledge of himseU; but was reserved as to the childhood spent with Adrian. In the few interviews which had taken place with him since, she imagined that"], [129, "uzelli's new model. 121 bis pride was wounded by any reference to that time. The conduct of his mother, now fully known to her, always seemed a most painful memory to him ; and she never directly alluded to it. She knew also, that her present mode of Ihe was distasteful to him, and it was with the happiest visions of the future that she came, in accordance with the professor's wish, that morning. She over looked aU difficulties in the arrangement, and accepted Uzelli's frank proposal, almost as unreservedly as it was offered. It is sometimes astonishing to see the eagerness with which girls in Cecily's position wiU seize upon any opportunity of exchanging theh profession for something far less remunerative ; yet which is not regarded by society as equivocal. The hope of meeting Adrian one day upon an equal footing, was, of all prospects, the most deUghtful to her. UzeUi was in the seventh heaven of fehcity : painting, chatting, laughing, and congratulating himseU upon having no pupils that morning ; when he was surprised by the entrance of Arthur Joyce and Jack Edie."], [130, "122 LOST FOOTSTEPS. < He turned from his work, with a look which indicated anything but a hearty welcome ; and the young gentlemen themselves were not a Uttle astonished at the sight of the beautiful ghl, and saw at once what a foolish blunder they had made. Arthur Joyce, however, was not to be put out of countenance in this way. He had come with Jack Edie, expressly to have a Uttle amusement at the professor's expense ; and did not see the fun of being checkmated at once. The modest manners, and ladylike composure of Cecily, did not greatly encourage the young men ; but Arthur's love of a joke nothing could repress. The consequence was that UzeUi, who had continued painting, without the slightest deference to his visitors, looking up, saw a shght blush upon CecUy's face. This was caused by Arthur, who had been pertinaciously winking at her, from the moment he entered the room. In an instant, UzelU divined the cause, and, glancing sharply round, caught him in the fact. Down went palette and mahlstick ; and before"], [131, "uzelli's new model. 123 Arthur could make the shghtest resistance, or offer any apology, the professor's hand was upon his collar ; and he found himself, in an other second, outside the studio. \" VU you follow him, sare, if you please ? \" enquired the professor, his eyes flashing like fire ; and his hands clutched ominously. \"Pardon me, mademoiselle,\" said Edie, bowing politely to Cecily, \" If I had known that my friend would so far forget himself, I would not have introduced him here.\" \" Zat is good,\" exclaimed the professor, much mollified. \" I forgU it zis time.

Losing not a moment for fear of discovery, Adrian made arrangements for escaping with Louise to England. Passing as his sister, journeying to England through dehcate health, she was so closely veUed and muffled up, that detection was not easy. He had extreme diffi culty in persuading her to quit Rotterdam without communicating with Mynheer Kalm ; but was so convinced that delay might be fatal to theh project, that he urged instant departure. The result was that, with Uttle difficulty, they got clear of Rotterdam, and, once more upon the sea, and with England shortly in sight, Adrian felt the secret safe. But when the terrible excitement of the past few days had subsided \u2014 when he looked before"], [133, "125 flight. and after, and canvassed, one by one, the diffi culties to be encountered, it must be confessed that he did not see his way very clearly. His own heart told him, but too plainly, that the proximity of one he had so dearly loved was not likely to deaden his former feelings. Indeed, aheady there were indications that her sensitive nature had taken the alarm, and he had felt it necessary to exercise the most rigid control over himself. He also began to see how very difficult it would be to introduce Louise into the little circle at Molton, in such a way as to relieve her own embarrassment, to satisfy the natural curiosity of his cousins, and to stay the chit-chat which immediately circulates in a country viUage, respecting every new comer \u2014 gossip, which might, in the case of enquiries being made upon M. Morel's behaU, speedUy reveal everything. He was for a long time puzzled, also, how to make any arrangement whatever, without taking some one into his confidence. After much consideration, he decided for the present,"], [134, "126 LOST FOOTSTEPS. only to confide the strange adventure to Mr. Joyce. He was confident that gentleman would, after a full explanation, saU in with his views, and render aU the assistance in his power. Besides, it was necessary, for other reasons, to make him acquainted with the whole of the circumstances, as he frequently corres ponded with Mynheer Kalm, and, it was just possible, that Mr. Joyce had already received intelhgence of her death from the placid Dutchman. He knew, also, that Mr. Joyce would be the fittest person to break, graduaUy, to Mynheer, the fact that his daughter yet Uved ; and he beheved that this could be much more effectuaUy done from England, than be fore they had left Rotterdam. Adrian felt sure that poor Mynheer, once more holding his beloved daughter in his arms, would not part from her, and that, in consequence, they would be in a far worse position in dealing with M. Morel. Adrian became extremely anxious as he neared Molton, and, for some time, he was in"], [135, "127 FLIGHT. doubt whether he had not better instal Louise in London at first ; but it was so impossible to judge w hat the action of M. Morel might be that he was unwilling to leave the faintest shadow of suspicion upon any of Louise's move ments. So unaccountable and unusual was the incident which had brought them together again, that he preferred to have a credible witness in case of need, as to the exact time when Louise arrived in England, and the circumstances which led to her making the journey. In addition to these precautions, which Adrian felt constrained to take, as a man of honour, he felt also that it would be no sUght advantage to have Mr. Joyce's influence on his side, with the Uttle circle. How he would be able to gratify the curiosity of AUce and Maude, was, as yet, a mystery ; but, happUy, Maude's attention was so frequently engrossed by two or three lovers, whose hearts she was doing her best to break by her capri cious moods, that she would soon lose all interest in Louise. AUce would, he knew, wonder that Louise should leave her husband"], [136, "128 LOST FOOTSTEPS. for any length of time, without apparent cause, and would, perhaps, question him ; especially as, during his stay in HoUand, he had written to her frequently and enthusiastically of the beauty and accomplishments of Louise. A sudden stop had taken place in these communications, and Alice divined, but too truly, what was the cause, though, with her usual delicacy, she had forborne to allude to the chcumstance, or to utter a single word that might give him pain. Then came again and again the question whether he was justified in introducing Louise, under all the circumstances. Although he in tended to take up his quarters in London, and to foUow art with greater assiduity than ever, he knew he would not be. able to resist the temptation of seeing Louise ; and when at Mol ton he would be thrown much into her society. And then he remembered, at first with delight, and afterwards with a certain sense of alarm, that Louise would not unnaturally seek his society, in preference to that of companions who were enthely new to her. Delightful as the"], [137, "129 FLIGHT. famiUarity might be, there was a lurking danger in it. The sensitive reserve which was now so apparent in her manner, might speedily wear off ; and, with her increased freedom, he would have a still greater effort to make, to keep within the bounds of ordinary friendship. Would it be possible for him to see her frequently, to speak of old days, to remind her that through his courage and patience she was probably rescued from death; and yet, with all these opportunities, never make any reference to the state of his own feelings. He knew how impossible it would be, yet watched the event like an absent dreamer, who sees his boat gliding onward, swUtly to the inevitable cataract ; and does not take the oars and pull vigorously in a contrary direction. From his uncle there was nothing to fear. The Fiend himseU, properly introduced, and keeping the cloven foot concealed, might have passed muster in his household, and would have been treated as a gentleman ; but a lady, young and beautiful, and the friend of Mr. Joyce \u2014 there was no more to be said. His father had seen more of the world ; vol. ii. 9"], [138, "130 LOST FOOTSTEPS. and it was very doubtful, Adrian thought, if he would not be able to see in what direction his son's affections were placed. There was the chance of distrust upon both sides ; but he must battle with the difficulty as he best could, and trust to such a solution of it as the future might have in store. Louise was more cheerful herself than Adrian could have anticipated; and the beauty of the pleasant Surrey landscapes, as they drove from Dorking, through narrow lanes, dusky, with luxuriant foliage ; and then suddenly emerged into spaces where the silver thread of a streamlet glittered in the sunlight, as they looked afar over a glorious expanse of hill, dale, and wood land, quite enchanted her. Adrian pointed out each separate beauty, with the eye, and the feeling of an artist, to whom an exquisite landscape was the most glorious sight in the world ; so happy for the time, that he forgot all the sorrow and trouble they had lately under gone. AU the sorrow, too, that might be garnered up in the future. Louise, also delighted with"], [139, "131 FLIGHT. scenery, so novel to her, could not resist the cheering influences of nature ; and was more like the Louise he had met upon the lawn at Rotterdam, than Adrian had seen her for many a day. She fell into the mood of her companion almost unconsciously, and her heightened colour, and the sparkling glances of her eyes, as she watched the Ughts and shadows upon the distant hiUs, made Adrian more infatuated then he had ever been before. \" Now look through the opening between those trees,\" he would say. \" That is Molton Church, where my uncle has preached these twenty years. It is almost like himself, that old grey honest tower, which has withstood the storms of five centuries ; you seem to read in its hoary wrinkled front, the peace and happiness it has given to thousands.

That's his house, under the brow of the hill ; the house with the two gables looking so white and cheerful above the dark green of the"], [140, "132 LOST FOOTSTEPS. poplars and elms. And is it not a charming view behind the house ? Those hills embroidered with heather, and wild flowers, have made more than one of our famous artists ; and, by Jove, they shall make another yet, though the temptation is strongest at this moment to dream away one's life in the happy valley, and forget the outer world entirely.\" \"I should be grieved to see that,\" answered Louise, looking somewhat gravely at him. \" I would rather, if I had been a man, have triumphed over difficulties and obstacles, making each ' lost footstep' a stepping stone to something higher and better. In fact, as one of your own poets, who will one day rank with the greatest, has just said, in \" In Memoriam\" \u2014 :' I bold this truth, with bim who sings, To one clear harp in divers tones ; That men may rise on stepping stones, Of their dead selves, to higher things.\" They were crossing a wooden bridge over a tiny stream, as Louise spoke thus, and Adrian looked up with some wonder at her earnestness. A moment after, he said dreamingly \u2014"], [141, "FLIGHT. 133 \" How often I have stood upon this little bridge, taxing my brain, whUe the gentle current rippled away beneath my feet, to unravel the mysteries of life, and our inmost feeUngs.

Louise lost in a moment the cheerful tone which had previously characterized her, and said, seriously \u2014 \" I fear, Mr. Hope, you are in some doubt as to my reception.\" \" None whatever \u2014 no it was not that \u2014 it was \u2014 weU, well ; I wa3 but thinking what might have been.

Ambition and hard work, may, perhaps, dull the memory of it in time ; but nothing can ever efface it, or make Use again what it has been.\" FoUowing the course he had decided upon during theh journey, Adrian went first to Mr. Joyce, and remained there some time, during which, he gave that gentleman a full and circum stantial account of all that had transpired since he"], [142, "134 LOST FOOTSTEPS. left England. There was no Umit to his astonish ment, and, lawyer-like, he cross-questioned Adrian most rigorously as to details, though at the same time, he received Louise with a warmth that dispelled all her previous apprehensions, and paved the way, by at once going to the curate, and stating that young Madame Morel, being in weak health, had yielded to his solicitations to visit England, and had now actually arrived. Thus assisted, Louise found herself amongst friends at once ; and, U she had accepted the warm invitation given, might have made a home at the curate's house from that moment ; but this, Mr. Joyce would not permit. For the best reasons, he thought it safer that Louise should spend her time principaUy with himseU. Martin Hope was from home when they called, but he soon came back ; Adrian introduced him and Louise remarked \u2014 \"Tou have so generally referred to your uncle, Mr. Hope, that I was not aware your parents were Uving.\" \" My father has been for some years abroad,\""], [143, "135 FLIGHT. he answered, with evident embarrassment, which induced Louise to say no more at the moment, When the stiffness of the first meeting had been got over, all were anxious to amuse her. Adrian showed her the rude studio in the hayloft, where his first visions of fame had been conjured up. Maude skipped about her and asked fifty ridiculous questions about Holland, wondering very much at the graceful figure before her, so different to her preconceived notions of Dutch ladies. It was rather chilly, and Martin, used to a warmer climate, suggested a fire, to the horror of Mrs. Crankley, who laid it down as a rule that no fire should be lighted in the parlour before the middle of October, or after the middle of AprU. \" If the weather would come out of season, it was nothing to her,\" said the old lady ; \" and it was no joke to get the bars bright again when once fires had been Ughted.\" A fire was Ughted, nevertheless ; and Mr. Joyce and the curate had a pleasant game of chess. Louise played some of the \" Lieder ohne worte \" of Mendelssohn, a style of music which"], [144, "136 LOST FOOTSTEPS. had not hitherto reach Molton. Altogether it was a pleasant evening, and it was late before they separated. Mr. Joyce, puUing out his old fashioned chronometer, which Maude vehemently insisted was an hour faster than usual, declared that it was midnight. \" Tou see our hfe here \u2014 can you be happy with us ? \" said Adrian to Louise, having contrived to detain her whUe Mr. Joyce was fiercely arguing with the curate upon some theological point, which, he stoutly maintained, was \" all stuff and nonsense. \" I could be happy, notwithstanding all I have to regret,\" she answered calmly, \" U I can remain here without losing seU-respect.\" For a moment the impetuous young man forgot the tie that bound her \u2014 forgot everything but bis passionate love. In a few fiery words, he spoke of his undying affection, until checked by her calm but inflexible glance.

She had, of her own wUl, taken M. Morel as her husband. Deceived she had been, but was not coerced ; and base, as he evidently was at heart \u2014 indifferent \u2014 greedy \u2014 sacrificing her youth and happiness for the means of extricating himself from his difficulties \u2014 yet, the vow she had taken, was, in her mind, unalterable, unchangeable, and would be desecrated by permitting such language from Adrian. A few days passed rapidly, and Louise nerved herseU to meet the difficulties of her position ; and real difficulties they soon became ; for with aU Adrian's determination to suppress his passion, he was often led to say and do things which filled his cousins with astonishment."], [146, "138 LOST FOOTSTEPS. That Louise should come to England for change of ah, seemed natural enough ; but when they saw (and both Alice and Maude could under stand love's language without the aid of any interpreter but theh own feehngs) the inspiration that Louise was to Adrian \u2014 when they saw his fervent looks, and heard his fervent language, and remembered that she was aheady a wife, a feeling of restraint and annoyance fiUed the quiet circle, and even Mrs. Crankley had been heard to say, that \" she hoped no mischief would come of it.\" No blame could be attributed to Louise, yet she felt uneasy in the prospect that the unfavourable impression evidently growing with reference to Adrian might be soon transferred to herseU. His apparent failure to guard his own secret induced her to treat him with greater coolness, a fact which was irritating almost beyond endurance. Louise knew that the incidents of the strange adventure which had brought her to England had not been imparted to the clergyman's family, and she urged Mr. Joyce to an explanation ; but that gentleman, with legal cautiousness, objected, until"], [147, "139 FLIGHT. he had ascertained what M.

Adrian resumed his studies under UzelU, astonished to find Cecily installed in the house of the old professor. In fact, the painter, as he had promised, formaUy adopted her ; and, but for the remembrance of the career led by her real father, she would have been very happy. Attracted at first by her great beauty, the professor soon learned to love her as though she had been his own child. He had been a Uttle annoyed at first to part with his old housekeeper, who for many years had become so accustomed to his habits, that he seemed to have lost his right hand. But he was not a man to be turned from his purpose, and Cecily, whose experiences in shUting for herself made her perfeotly at home in a few hours, soon learned to adapt herself to his"], [149, "A MEETING. 141 ways, and tried most successfully to make his house and studio more homely and comfortable. For the first time in his experience, Adrian saw the professor painting in a clean hohand blouse, and though he daubed it over with as great a variety of colour as Joseph's coat \u2014 tore one of the sleeves with a rusty nail, and made an impromptu landscape of a most extraordinary character upon the skirts, by sitting down on his palette in a fit of abstract contemplation ; he was evidently well pleased by her attention and care for him. UzeUi had learned from Cecily the particulars of her early life, which, although the old professor never made the slighest allusion to the fact, caused Adrian considerable pain. Pure and amiable as Cecily was, beautiful and talented, and warmly attached to him, there was yet a coldness in his manner which repeUed her. The truth was, that the sight of Cecily, and the remembrance of her parentage, wounded his pride. It appeared to him that the misfortunes hanging over his earUer life, were but an additional stumbling block with regard to Louise."], [150, "142 LOST FOOTSTEPS. WoUe, he thought, always hated him ; and he often wondered if they would ever meet again. Cecily was entirely silent upon the subject since her father's imprisonment ; but the term for which he was sentenced she knew must have long expired. He had probably been engaged in some nefarious scheme which supplied him with cash for the time ; and, therefore, made no enquiry after his daughter. But one morning when they were engaged in the studio, aud Cecily had highly dehghted UzeUi by sitting in a most graceful attitude and looking her very sweetest for nearly an hour, the door of the studio opened, and a man stepped into the room, whose appearance created quite a stir in the party. It was no other than WoUe. Cecily, though so reserved upon this theme, had suspected and feared that he was again imprisoned. This had not been the case. WoUe's appearance was, however, miserable in the extreme. His clothes were dusty and tattered, and he looked haggard, and worn, perhaps with fatigue, and want of food ; his shoes were almost"], [151, "143 A MEETING. to pieces, as though he had travelled some great distance on foot. It was the first time Adrian had seen him so depressed. GeneraUy the ready wit and impu dence of the man had been sufficient to keep him out of actual want ; but it was evident, now, that he had lost his former dash and bravado, and was in actual distress. Since the visit to Molton, terminated by the attack on Mr. Gabriel's house, which was frustrated by his father, Adrian had never seen him ; and the first thought that entered his mind now was whether, under pressure, he might be induced to make an explanation of the events which threw so much gloom over his father's past hfe. Adrian received him with a certain expression of welcome, which appeared greatly to astonish him. He had long lost any belief in human generosity, but he was evidently touched, and especially when Cecily, with her dehghtful ten derness of manner and tone, introduced him to the professor, as her father, and, in a few brief, hasty words, scarcely intelligible, on account of"], [152, "144 LOST FOOTSTEPS, her emotion, alluded to the professor's generous conduct to herself. Wolfe had taken a chair when he first en tered the room; but as he heard Cecily's explanation of her presence there, he rose hastily, and advanced towards UzeUi, as though he would have shaken hands with him, but, in stantly changing his mind, he sat down again, glancing uneasily at the door, as tf he had been watched. All his mirth, cunning, and coarse humour had left him. There was something utterly reckless and abandoned in his look, aggravated, evidently, by hard drinking and exposure. StUl the face had a rough intelligence, which was not unpleasing. UzelU and Adrian, both wondering, made some attempts to draw him into conversation; but he only answered in monosyllables. At length UzelU placed a decanter of wine before liim, at which the showman gave vent to a course laugh, and said, with some assumption of his old manner \u2014"], [153, "145 A MEETING. \" Ah, that's the way to loosen a man's tongue. Jolly good stuff, too,\" he added, smacking his lips. \" WeU, I drink your good health, all of you, and I'll drink farewell at the same time, for it may be a long whUe before I see either of you again : but I could'nt leave the country without another look at my wench,\" and he patted her on the shoulder, \"though she was such a shy Uttle fool, and didn't hke showing her pretty figure. I did think whether she'd like to go with me to Australia, but she's so well cared for, and, as I must be off in a devU of a hurry \" UzelU had been in a flutter of anxiety to hear this suggestion ; but the moment he saw that WoUe would be well satisfied to leave Cecily where she was, his admiration for his visitor knew no bounds. \" Take anozer glass of wine, my dear friend : don't spare de bottle \u2014 and you go to Australia ? eh, bien.

WoUe drank two or three glasses more of the wine, and then rambled on rather as though following the impulses of his own mind, than out of any consideration for his listeners. From a few vague, general remarks, his words grew at length into a kind of sohloquy. \" Ah, I've known what it was to have money,\" he muttered, ?' and I've known what it was to love a woman dearly, and to get into devUish hot water for her sake, I can teU you. But pish ! it's no use talking of that, now. She's dead and gone \u2014 so much the better.\" Nobody interrupted him ; but Adrian remarked that a shade of melancholy passed over his features, notwithstanding the recklessness of his tone. \" Hang it! \" he continued, in the same rambling style ; \" I've tasted most of the pleasures of Use, and now I suppose it's come to my turn to have the pains. I shan't bear them long, I dare say ; but no matter for that. If there's a worse world than this, it must be an infernally bad one, and no mistake.\""], [155, "147 A MEETING. \" Are you destitute of that hope, and beUef, which makes this world, with all its trials and disappointments, endurable ? \" enquired Adrian. \" None of your preaching ! \" cried WoUe, looking up almost savagely. \" If I could pray, it would be that I might never see the light of another day.\" His sudden energy immediately died out again, and he feU into his former disjointed strain. It was useless to argue with such a man ; but Adrian felt a kind of awful pity in Ustening to him, as he hinted, under the influence of the wine, at scenes of vice and depravity, while his eyes glowed with passion, his Ups curled sarcastically, and an occasional smile, which greatly aggravated his fierce expression, passed over his features. There was quite a fascination for UzeUi in the really fine proportions of WoUe's figure, and the reckless expression of his wild face ; and, with his feeling for art ever uttermost in his mind, he sketched the man almost instantaneously. He had been thinking over a scene from \" Paradise Lost,\" and here was a sketch for his Satan ready"], [156, "148 LOST FOOTSTEPS. to hand. For crime, abuse, and evh passion, had stamped such an indehble mark upon his face, that most of what was purely human had been obliterated. Suddenly, when Uzelh was in the midst of another sketch, WoUe startled him, by jumping up abruptly. Adrian and CecUy looked at him with alarm, fearing that he had lost his senses, for he was staring wildly at the unfinished picture from the \" Tempest,\" which hung upon the opposite waU. \" Where did that come from ? \" enquired WoUe, pointing to it. \" This gentleman has painted it. It is a scene from Shakespeare,\" answered Adrian. \" But the figure in the centre,\" and he staggered towards the picture. \" The woman there \u2014 don't \u2014 don't tell me \u2014 she's a fancy portrait, for I won't beheve it.\" \"Certainly not,\" said UzeUi, \"here is ze original.\" As he pointed to Cecily, Wolfe looked at her with a bewildered stare, and said \u2014"], [157, "149 A MEETING. \" Ah, yes, to be sure \u2014 at first I thought it was her mother, as I first knew her \u2014 Hush ! what's that?\" Adrian looked into the square ; but the place was quite deserted, yet WoUe continued to listen attentively, until Adrian's doubts of his sanity became stronger than ever, especially as, after walking to the window, he came back and sat listlessly down in an attitude of utter despair. \" It's all up with me,\" said he ; \" I've walked two hundred miles ; but they have nabbed me after all.\" Hasty steps were heard approaching, and in another moment two pohce officers rushed into the room, foUowed by Cecily, who had opened the door. The moment she saw them, she guessed their errand, and, with a passionate cry, fell fainting upon the floor. Coarse and hard ened as WoUe had become, he was human still, and love had not lost its sacred power over his heart. TrembUng from head to foot, he motioned to the officers to leave him free yet a moment longer, and, raising his beautiful daughter in"], [158, "150 LOST FOOTSTEPS. his arms, he attempted to console her with a rough tenderness, as unexpected as it was sur prising, and said \u2014 \"My pretty wench, you would have made a man of me, but it's too late, my darling.\" The officers were moved by the scene ; but anxious to spare her distress when she recovered, hurriedly parted them, and took Wolfe prisoner. \" Fare ye well, sh, and God bless you, in making a home for CecUy. Good bye, Adrian ; you see I know you stUl; and, now, as we part altogether, let me teU you something you would Uke to know.\" \" What is it ? \" cried Adrian, eagerly, yet afraid that he might repent his curiosity in another moment. \" Tour mother was CecUy's mother, too ; and the only woman I ever reaUy cared two straws for.

A Discovert. It was hardly possible to imagine a greater contrast than the aspect of the chateau, upon the evening of the day when Louise was lying there, as they believed, dead, as compared with the gaiety which had characterised it in the earUer days of theh marriage. Callous as Guillaume Morel was, he could not avoid the gloomy impression, as the paUid moonUght streamed into tho huge, and now neglected, apartments, and the wind moaned fitfully in the boughs of the lofty trees upon the terrace, as though they, too, lamented the loss of the lovely girl, who once stroUed so joyously beneath theh pleasant shadows.

Everywhere upon the Continent interment takes place very speedUy after death. Aheady arrangements had been made for the funeral ceremonies, and M. Morel knew that he would"], [162, "154 LOST FOOTSTEPS. now probably see the features of his lost wife for the last time. He was almost tempted to ask his mother to accompany him ; but he felt it would be an additional pain to her, for Madame Morel had displayed unmistakable grief for the loss of her daughter-in-law. It was mainly due to her perseverance that Louise became her son's wife, and she reproached herseU bitterly, as she reflected that the utter disappointment and disenchantment of Louise had perhaps greatly hastened her untimely end. M. Morel would gladly have had her com panionship, for never in his life could he remember when he had felt so utterly alone \u2014 so completely depressed in spirits. Louise had prophecied truly, when she told him that his flippant worldly associates would saU off upon the first hint of trial or misfortune. Indeed, there was not a soul to give him sympathy, he was enthely isolated. He was not superstitious ; he had as much courage as most men, but there are times when the most fearless shrink in solemn awe, even from the phantoms conjured up by"], [163, "155 A DISCOVERY. their own imagination ; when thoughts and ideas will come, and images shape themselves with a strange suggestiveness, not to be driven away by any effort of the reason or wiU. And it was with some such feeling that M. Morel reached the chamber of death \u2014 a feeUng that the future had a destiny in store for him, over which he had no control \u2014 that he must follow blindly in the path that was before him, knowing neither its limit nor its dangers. Unable to shake off this nervous apprehension, this terrible retribution which the conscience hurls back so defiantly upon those who neglect its warnings, he could not at first summon up courage to approach the couch. There was nothing in the first aspect of the room, as he entered it, to awaken suspicion. The closely drawn curtains kept out the ghostly moon light, and the room would have been enthely dark, but for the tiny lamp burning dimly there, and reveahng indistinctly the various objects in the chamber. Filled with vague apprehensions, M. Morel could not endure the awful silence and"], [164, "156 LOST FOOTSTEPS. gloom of the apartment, but drew aside the curtains, and let in a flood of moonlight, and listened for awhile to the monotonous sighing of the wind in the trees. There were slight noises in the chateau, for the servants were arranging for expected guests, who would take part in the funeral ceremonies ; but the remoteness of the room rendered any echoes of Use at a distance extremely indistinct. He was in a painful brooding state of mind, which neither the beauty of the night, nor the solemn purpose for which he had entered the room, could overcome. But at length, conquering his irresolution, he approached the couch. In another moment he staggered back petrified with horror, when he made the discovery that the dead lady was no longer lying there. Sheer terror and bewilderment for a few minutes chained him to the spot. By what astounding chance, or by what mysterious agency the body of his late wUe could have been removed from a house surrounded by servants and frequent visitors, from a chamber which had been occupied"], [165, "157 A DISCOVERY. by physicians and nurses, was utterly beyond his conception. His first impulse, when he recovered his faculties, was to fasten the door, and secure himself from intrusion, while he pondered over this inscrutable mystery. He had not forgotten that the possession of a large sum of money would speedily be his in accordance with the terms of the marriage settlement ; and thus, upon the death of his wife depended whether he could retain the chateau, and make terms of some sort with his now clamorous creditors. He had mortgaged the estate to its full value soon after his marriage, and the whole of the proceeds had been squandered recklessly. His only prospect of keeping his former position was in the death of Louise, and the proof of his legal right to her property ; and the strange disappearance of his dead wife fiUed him with the greatest alarm. He thought rapidly over the various schemes which might have been adopted to remove Louise from the house, and calculated with the acuteness of a man of the world, theh probable object. At first it appeared to him a trick on the part of some"], [166, "158 LOST FOOTSTEPS. of his late whe's relatives, to prevent him from obtaining possession of her money. But in revolving this idea, he could only remember Mr. Joyce as especiaUy interested, and he could not for a moment beUeve that gentleman would adopt such a policy as this. Then his thoughts turned to Mynheer Kalm, and knowing the deep affection he entertained for his daughter, and the eccentric character of the old Dutchman, he wondered if Mynheer, assisted by Kloots, perhaps, had taken this unusual proceeding ; but this idea was instantly scouted. Mynheer was much too slow \u2014 much too influenced by the ordinary observances of society \u2014 to concert such a plan as this. From Mynheer Kalm his ideas fell upon Adrian ; but he remembered the unfinished letter Louise had written to her father, and the cross-questioning to which he had submitted the servants in reference to the young painter, and felt quite assured that Adrian had never been in Rotterdam since theh marriage. Then came a readier solution of the mystery. The cause of his young wife's death had baffled"], [167, "159 A DISCOVERY. the young physician who attended her at first. He was evidently in doubt up to the last moment. What more likely than that, in the ardour of science, he had conveyed Louise away, with the aid of his assistants, for the purpose of discovering, tf possible, the cause of a death so unusual. M. Morel felt comparatively satisfied when this idea occurred to him, and believed that the corpse of his wUe would surely and secretly be returned in the course of a few hours. If, however, this should not, after all, be the right solution, how else could he fathom the secret, without making the whole affair pubhc ? In what direction could he turn ? He dared not question the servants, who were evidently enthely ignorant upon the subject ; yet they must be communicated with at once, or the first that entered the room might make the discovery, alarm the entire household, and entirely prevent immediate action on his part. If, on the other hand, he remained where he was, the physician would find it impossible to restore the body secretly, and it was impossible to say what consequences might ensue. He felt that"], [168, "160 LOST FOOTSTEPS. it was absolutely necessary to give immediate orders that no one entered the chamber without his special permission. Having decided upon this plan, he questioned the maid, who had been in close attendance upon Louise up to the time of her death, whether any strangers or visitors had been seen in the vicinity ; but the ghl kept her secret. Though terribly excited by the death of her beloved young mistress, she had yet sufficient control over her feelings to blind M. Morel as to the secret visit paid by Adrian immediately after her mistress's death ; and not knowing the exact moment of his departure, she was utterly ignorant of the precious burden he carried with him in his flight from the chateau. It was true she had entered the room once while Adrian was there; but his motionless attitude, and utter absorption of mind, precluded the idea of any event so unexpected and startling as that which actuaUy took place a few moments later. She had not entered the room after that, and now M. Morel gave the most stringent"], [169, "A DISCOVERY. 161 orders that no one should intrude in the chamber of death, without direct leave from him. His serious, anxious look, made the ghl believe that he must really have felt the loss of his young wUe more acutely than they had imagined, and, in her affection for her lost mistress, she readily entered into M. Morel's views, and kept her companions aloof. It was a weary, anxious night for Guillaume Morel, especially as after some hours had passed, he became convinced that he was altogether at fault in his solution of this strange event. His next scheme must be to take some one into his confidence, by means of a heavy bribe, and so arrange that the funeral might take place in the ordinary course, without arousing any suspicious comments. A crisis was approaching in M. Morel's affairs, and delay was simply impossible. The news of his wife's death had circulated among his creditors, and more than one of them had pounced down upon the estate, and forced them selves into his presence, with the view of being VOL.

Neither the solemnity of death, nor the prospect of a speedy settlement, served to pacify the rapaciousness of these wolfish attendants. The coolness and polished manners of GuiUaume Morel had staved off year after year the in evitable ruin which his own conduct was bringing about ; but, latterly, certain sharp practices he had adopted to gain time had been brought to light, and all confidence in him was lost. The following morning brought certain proof that he had been altogether at fault in his view of the disappearance of Louise. The physician himseU caUed, and, whether he was stUl in doubt or not, his calmness of manner at once dispelled the idea that any such a course had been conceived, as that suspected by M. Morel. There was but one plan now open to the perplexed man, and, dangerous as it was, he determined to try it, and trust to chance. The funeral must take place ; and in due course he would claim the property he coveted."], [171, "163 A DISCOVERY. As time passed, therefore, the arrangements were completed. Guests arrived and took part in the ceremony. The service proceeded \u2014 the coffin lowered into the vault,was strewn with flowers by the hands of beautUul girls who had known and loved Louise in happier days, and beautUul eyes were dim with tears over the fate of one whose end seemed so untimely. Poor Mynheer Kalm's grotesque exhibition of grief would have excited ridicule ; but that it was so real. The old Dutch man was absolutely paralysed by the event, and none could see him without sympathy. He turned from the spot when the vault closed over his lost Louise, like one who had awakened from a fearful dream. There was an expression of intense rehef upon M. Morel's face when the funeral ceremonies had concluded, which had not escaped observation. Mingled with the spectators, stood a person who, in consequence of a communication from Mr. Joyce, had watched the proceedings with the keenest interest, not unniingled with a certain sarcastic enjoyment of the event, and its probable"], [172, "164 LOST FOOTSTEPS. consequences.

They were really handsome feUows, with easy, off-hand manners, and had contrived to make acquaintances in circles high above them. Notwithstanding Edie's apparent earnestness, it was stiU from being genuine affection he felt for CecUy.

Even a genuine lover, which Edie was yet far from being, wiU nourish his stomach and his passion, at the same moment, and not allow one to supersede the other. They had, it must be confessed, most un poetical appetites, and, as the viands were first class, and two or three choice spirits came to partake of the creature comforts with them, they soon became pretty jovial. By and by, there was dancing, to wind up the"], [178, "170 LOST FOOTSTEPS. entertainment, and plenty of coral lips and bright eyes for partners; but Edie pronounced dancing \" a precious deal too hard work. At the mature age of six-and-twenty, a man had Uved past the follies of his youth,\" and so on. He, how ever, joined in two or three sets, and then lounged upon the sofas beside the girls, with delicious exotics perfuming the atmosphere, and lamps discreetly shaded, gleaming upon the snowy shoulders belonging to the coral lips and bright eyes. Arthur said it was a bore to move, and they might just as well \u2014 or rather better \u2014 stay where they where.

Edie was caUous enough toward them in his heart. He had once allowed himseU to be tempted into a warmer feeling, and had learned a lesson he had not forgotten. He dreamt for a brief moment of real affection, and disinterested motives ; but the idol of his transient passion married in three months after a titled octogenarian. He had met her since, calm, seU possessed, satisfied with her costly dresses, carriages, and position in society. He would not again commit the folly of supposing that a woman could entertain genuine affection for a poor devil like himself. Perhaps the purposeless Use he led dated from that incident. He was equaUy bored with his pursuits and his pleasures. There were moments when he haU believed that there might be a better lUe in store, that it might be worth a struggle, perhaps, to find something true and noble to pursue ; but he soon dismissed these aspirations. When the bright eyes and coral lips had"], [180, "172 LOST FOOTSTEPS. departed, Edie rose from his seat, snapped his fingers behind the backs of the chaperones, and nudged Arthur, who was beginnning to nod. \" Come, Arthur, it's nearly daylight.\" \" It's a bore to come out, and a precious bore to go home,\" said that young gentleman, drearily. \" What do people live for ?

Arthur Joyce lived in the Temple stUl ; but had agreed to stay for the remainder of the night with Edie, who had apartments near Euston-square. \" We'll go through Fitzroy Square,\" said Edie. \" Tou won't surely caU upon your lady love, at this time of the night,\" said Arthur, laughing. Nothing, however, would pactfy Edie, but driving through the square. When the cab passed"], [181, "173 SUSPENSE.

Fortunately CecUy was stUl ignorant of the terrible crime for which WoUe had been dragged away from her very presence ; but even as it was, the shock had been so great, that for several hours she was hardly conscious. Recovering at length, she saw Adrian standing at the bed side with UzeUi, \" Be calm, dear CeoUy,\" Adrian said tenderly, \" you must not agitate yourseU, or,\" he added in a whisper, \" you will make the professor utterly miserable.\" The sight of Adrian standing there, recaUed but too vividly the youth they had spent together."], [182, "174 LOST FOOTSTEPS.

Not all these recollections of the hardened, reckless man, whose ungoverned passions and excesses had placed him in such a fearful position, subdued her affection for him in the least. Her's was the charity that never faUeth.

He, however, peeped in himself every five minutes, delighted at last to find her in a refreshing sleep. When he came again in an hour or so, he was about, to tap at the door, when he fancied he heard her voice in faint tones. Greatly alarmed at first, he listened, unwilling to disturb her; soon he detected her pure sweet accents in earnest prayer. Faintly at first, and in almost inaudible tones ; but at length, as though her spirit gradually shook off its earthly timidity, her voice became clear and distinct. With an emotion to which it is not possible to do justice in words UzeUi heard for whom she prayed.

WhUe seeking this new residence, Martin read one day an advertisement, which seemed to promise aU that could be desired, it described \u2014 \" A luxuriant nook, completely sheltered by its own grounds, and so favoured by nature as scarcely to need the resources of art.

Percival had gone with his brother, to see him instaUed in his new home ; Mr. Joyce also had accompanied them. Adrian stiU remained in town owing to his anxiety respecting WoUe. In the meantime he hesitated about accepting Martin's proposal. He had striven in vain to subdue his passion for Louise. He had hoped in his secret heart that he could have persuaded her to a separation, and had resolved to make an attempt once more to induce her to alter her determination. He arrived at Molton, having purposely so timed his visit, as to be pretty certain of finding Louise alone. It was evening when he reached there ; but Mr. Joyce's snug parlour was not yet Ughted up. It was the connoisseur's favourite room, for"], [192, "184 LOST FOOTSTEPS. the windows opened upon a wide prospect of charming landscape, and many an hour did Mr. Joyce sit there, watching the fading hues of the sunset, and the purple tints of the heather clad hills.

Martin, Percival, and Mr. Joyce, sat and watched the tempest from the window of the hotel, the house he had taken not being quite ready for occupation. Martin, during his wild life in AustraUa, had made frequent voyages, and felt himseU completely at home by the seaside. Watching it with experienced eyes, he prophesied the most fearful storm that had been known for years ; and the aspect of the waves, boiling and"], [200, "192 LOST FOOTSTEPS. surging now up to the very base of the cliffs, the snowy crests of the breakers being lost in one confused mass of foam, seemed to indicate that his prediction would be speedUy verified. Far upon the sea, tossed by the waves, and swept by the raging spray, might be seen a solitary vessel, which appeared to he at the mercy of the troubled ocean. As it grew darker, Martin became very uneasy as to her fate, especiaUy as she drifted towards the land. Some hours passed away, and it was hoped that she had put out to sea, when an alarm was raised that a large vessel was stranded at some little distance down the bay upon a dangerous quicksand, and that the waves were beating her to pieces. Martin, Mr. Joyce, and Percival, at once started with some visitors from the hotel to a cliff, from which it was said a view might be obtained of the sands upon which the vessel was stranded. A duU fog hung over the sea, and almost obscured the little hght remaining in the west, while the furious wind carried the spray up above the edge of the cliff, and beat it in their faces. What with"], [201, "193 THE RESCUE. the roar of the wind, and the hoarse clamour of the waves, they could scarcely hear each other's voices. When they reached the point nearest to the unfortunate vessel, the fog had cleared away a little, owing to the violence of the wind, and the appearance of the sea was awful in the extreme. Each wild rolling wave, with its ridge of white foam, stood out against the faint Ught like a bank of snow ; heavy masses of dense cloud hung suUenly over the doomed ship, whUe lighter clouds were dashed wUdly across the sky by the violent wind. The dim light remaining only served to show more clearly how little hope there was for a soul on board, and the few shuddering spectators who had come to the spot lamented bitterly, as any men with human feeling must at such a time, that they were so helpless. There was no Use boat, and no other could possibly Uve in such a sea.

Suddenly, while they watched, there came a flash, and then a dull sound, scarcely heard above the roar of the ocean. \" They aro firing signals of distress,\" said Martin. \" Let us get a Uttle nearer, I may be of some service perhaps.\" They clambered down the cliff as best they could, and when they came nearer, they found several persons assembled from the hotel and the little town.

Sorely touched as the hardy sailors may have been, they could not alleviate the distress, they could only obey orders, and wait the result. Some, haU-stripped, stood ready, in case all else should fail, to plunge overboard into the boiling surge and struggle for land. Amongst the spectators, Martin and Mr. Joyce were conspicuous in theh offers of assistance. Mr. Joyce, however, a town-bred man, could not be of much service, while Martin, who had more than once been wrecked himself, was calm and"], [204, "196 LOST FOOTSTEPS. collected, and insphed the coast guard with so much confidence, that he was aUowed to assist in firing rockets to the ship. After many faUures, they at length succeeded in throwing a Une to the vessel. Martin had great strength and unbounded courage, and, watching at him there so earnest and fearless, Mr. Hope was human enough to wish he could be seen by some of his disaffected congrega tion, for he looked every inch a hero. Communication being estabhshed with the ship, the passengers crowded to the bulwarks in the hope of being speedily taken off, and exposed themselves in consequence to the greatest danger. Just as the sailors were endeavouring to arrange for theh rescue, a huge wave leaped up the vessel's sides and swept several of the foremost into the sea. \" Martin, what are you doing ?

Mr. Joyce did his best to console him, but a dreadful feeling of doubt was in his own heart. Martin had fearlessly plunged into the sea in the hope of saving one of the group which had been swept off the deck ; but the darkness, and the violence of the waves, prevented him making any way for a considerable time. At length, after battling long and fruitlessly with the waves, he saw a dark form rise to the surface, and clutched it vigorously ; then, seeing no one else near, he made for the shore. An advancing wave lent him its assistance, and in a few minutes, amidst tremendous shouts from the people on shore, Martin brought a man safe to land.

It was with intense satisfaction they learned that Martin suffered only from exhaustion, and, indeed, by the next morning, he appeared to have entirely recovered from the effects of his late struggle. Not so the man whom he had saved. In addition to injuries he had received through being dashed by the waves against a sunken rock, the physician declared him to be greatly debUitated in constitution, and promised a very slow recovery.

He could not imagine where he had seen the stranger's face, and yet it seemed famihar to him.

The Unes, either of care or dissipation, were strongly marked upon the face, which must have once been striking and attractive.

The astonishment with which Mr. Joyce read the name of GuUlaume Morel, speedUy gave way to a certain amount of irritation ; aU the particulars of the sham funeral had been duly reported to him by a friend, in whom he had the greatest confidence, and the lawyer had at once taken steps to hinder the payment of the large sum to which he became entitled in the event of the real death of Louise. He was aware how useless it would be to expect Mynheer Kalm to move at once in the matter, though he had written a cautiously-worded letter to that gentleman, warning him that he would shortly come to Rotterdam and make an extraor dinary revelation respecting the fate of his beloved daughter, urging him also to sign no document on behalf of M.

Mr. Joyce's first impression was that, notwith standing his promptitude, the agent upon whom he rehed had been too late to oppose the fraudulent designs of M.

Another conclusion was, that Guillaume Morel had learned by some means that Louise was alive and in England, and had come over to make terms. In either case, the matter was becoming more complicated. Once put off the scent, Mr. Joyce was filled with eagerness to try some new course, and the fact that GuiUaume Morel lay there with Uttle probabiUty that he would ever recover, made Mr. Joyce more anxious than ever to ascertain what action he had taken before quitting Rotterdam. Without immediately making his discovery public, he instantly telegraphed the news to"], [212, "204 LOST FOOTSTEPS. Adrian, upon whom the inteUigence fell like a thunderbolt. In all the possibUities of the drama in which he had played so important a part, the young artist had never dreamt of such an incident as this. That M. Morel should be coming to England under any circumstances afforded grave matter for conjecture, and the first thought that entered Adrian's mind was, that he had discovered the almost miraculous escape of his wife, and that the strange incident had worked upon his better feelings, and had induced him to seek her out with the view of making reparation for his former caUous and apathetic behaviour. This supposition was quickly put aside when he reflected upon M. Morel's conduct during the past year, and he was convinced that something more ignoble was at the bottom of his journey to England. Most Ukely the dread of losing his newly-acquired fortune had alone influenced him ; he perhaps hoped by threat or persuasion to induce her to forego her proper claims. Adrian was aware that without this assistance"], [213, "MAN PROPOSES \u2014 GOD DISPOSES. 205 M. Morel was a ruined man. A passing thought at first was, that he might only be coming away to avoid his more pressing creditors, but in that case Mr. Joyce would hardly have telegraphed for him. The strangeness of the incident, coupled with the fact that Martin should have been the means of rescuing him from the wreck, deeply impressed Adrian. The man of all others he would have avoided, was here, thrown by accident in his very path ; and his future career, and future happiness, hung upon the result of the event. Probably there are few who have not at some time or other thought, \" If it were not for this man or that man, my position might be so different ;\" and for a moment it must be confessed Adrian could not help indulging in a dream of the happiness which might have been his if his father had not plunged into the sea and brought this man to land. The teachings of Percival Hope, however, had been too weU grounded to allow such a wish more than a momentary dweU ing-place in his mind. He was extremely anxious with regard to"], [214, "206 LOST FOOTSTEPS, Louise. He felt that a meeting with M.

When Adrian was admitted to the bedside of M. Morel, and saw once more the ghastly pallid features of the man who but such a short time before had been his handsome poUshed rival ; a man whose ease of manner, accomplishments, and perfect coolness, had caused him the bitterest jealousy, he was deeply moved. Adrian alone was able to judge of this great change, for he only had been upon terms of intimacy with him. Mr. Joyce had perhaps seen him not more than twice, and the alteration in his appearance was so great, that Adrian wondered not in the least that Mr- Joyce failed to recognise him. The physician had visited M. Morel just as Adrian arrived, and gave Uttle hope of his recovery. Though almost speechless from exhaustion, he had become sensible, and the physician advised if there were any important"], [215, "MAN PROPOSES \u2014 GOD DISPOSES. 207 affairs to arrange, that they should be speedily attended to. Adrian took counsel of his friends, and acting under theh advice, narrated as briefly and calmly as he could to M. Morel the incidents of his young wUe's escape from death, subsequent recovery, and journey to England. His weakness and excitement were so great, that it was only by painfully-slow degrees, and after many interrup tions, that Adrian completed the story. Nothing could be more dehcate than the manner in which this was done by Adrian. He had the greatest difficulty at times in continuing the subject, for it was evident that M. Morel, in view of the near approach of death, suffered keenly from remorse.

Her health is still deUcate ; and let me implore you, M.

Overcome by weakness and anxiety, a relapse took place, and for many hours M. Morel hovered upon the brink of eternity. Like a dying lamp, the flame of Use flickered up for a moment, then drooped again, as if it would soon go out for ever. Adrian watched him with truly Christian patienoe and goodwiU. It was the first great lesson of his Use, and he learned it not without after profit. Bitter and remorseless as fate seemed to be towards him, he had not forgotten the simple teaching of his happy chUdhood ; and now that this man, whom he had learned to regard as an enemy, had been mysteriously brought back from death to be as it were a stumbling-block in the way of his passionate desires, he felt and acknowledged the might of an omnipotent power, before whose influence he was humbled to the earth. He was reconcUed now to the inevitable, and it was great consolation in his moment of grief to feel that he had at least done something worthy on behaU of Louise, though they might evermore be strangers.

The reappearance of Wolfe had been a terrible blow, both for Cecily and UzeUi, who were beginning to understand each other thoroughly.

He had such a horror of figures, that it was the most difficult matter in the world to get him to look at the accounts. Perhaps, after dodging him for an hour or two, he would say laughingly, \" Keep ze change, ma chere, it vU be aU right.\" \" But I don't want it, indeed, sir,\" CecUy would answer. \" Go to ze Unendraper's shop, my lose.\" \" Tou are so kind, that I have more dresses already than I can wear.\" \" Zen bring ze book to-morrow, and I wUl look at him.\" \"No, you must please to look at it now, sh,\" Cecily urged. \" I have had a heavy week, and nearly aU the five-pound-note you gave me is gone.\" \" No matter, zere is anozer left.

Grateful to the professor from her very heart, she made no scruple in watching his interests closely, in keeping account of the lessons he gave, and in asking promptly for payment as the fees became due ; for the professor himseU made no entries of his engagements, and had always been at the mercy of others in all money matters. The result of Cecily's energetio management was, that the professor found himself in the receipt of a steady income, which amply sufficed for his modest housekeeping ; and when, having sold a picture for a considerable sum, he found he had no back debts to clear up, and that it had not been necessary for him to apply to Mr. Joyce for a loan for many months, he was quite bewUdered with his good fortune. The fact of Cecily making both ends meet, was httle short of a miracle to UzeUi. The auditing of the weekly accounts sometimes occupied the whole of the day; after merrily dodging CecUy for an hour or two after breakfast UzelU, U he found himseU hard pressed, made an"], [224, "216 LOST FOOTSTEPS. excuse to go out for a stroll ; then, the chances were, that he met some artist friend, in which case he would delightedly invite him to dinner, and chuckle joyously to himseU in anticipation of Cecily's discomfiture, seeing that some Uttle dainty and a bottle of wine would be required out of her balance in hand ; and the professor would grin mischievously all the dinner time. However, when the visitor departed, she renewed the attack ; then, perhaps, UzeUi, suddenly slapping his forehead, would exclaim \u2014 \" Ah, CecUy, vat a grand idea I have. It is magnifique, and must not be lost for ze vorld \u2014 sit down, ma chere, and I vU put you on de canvas in a minute.\" When this minute had extended to a couple of hours, he would say abruptly \u2014 \" It gives me ze headache, my lose ; all work and no play make UzeUi a duU boy ; and ze beautUul CecUy vil now make a cup of her best coffee, zen, mine Got, we wiU study ze house keeping book togezer.\" Driven at length to submit to this afflicting"], [225, "Cecily's housekeeping. 217 ordeal, nothing would pacify him but a tumbler of negus and a cigar ; then, sipping gaily this mild beverage, and blowing a meditative cloud, the professor, with a remarkably good-tempered frown, would, by way of revenge, condemn Cecily's items one by one. When she read out, for instance, \" coals,\" the professor would exclaim merrily, \" zey was bad coals, CecUy ; I poke de fire all ze day, and zey go out after all.\" \" Tou naughty man, you would'nt wait till the fire had burnt up properly.\" Or, he would declare that the lamp gave a bad light, and avow that Cecily had poured the salad oil into it, and used the Colza oU for the salad ; or assure her gravely that it was treacle he was pouring over his chop or steak instead of mushroom ketchup ; and the more CecUy asserted her infalhbUity, the brisker UzeUi's ridicule became, until, upon one occasion, she could hardly believe he was only joking, and, looking up suddenly, the old painter saw tears in her eyes. From that moment the housekeeping book was"], [226, "218 LOST FOOTSTEPS. doomed. UzelU, snatching it from Cecily's hand, opened the window and hurled it into the square ; a tramp, who was passing, caught it, and imagining that he had got a prize, bowed low his ack nowledgments, to the infinite amusement of the professor, as he watched the intense disgust with which the treasure-trove was tossed into the enclosure, finaUy to be brought back by an officious policeman, who, touching his hat, \" wished to see Mr. UzeUi particularly,\" and was indignant beyond measure, when the professor, an hour or two later, being caUed from his studio, to receive in state the housekeeping book, swore at the guardian of the public peace in French, German, Itahan, and Enghsh, and put the obhging functionary in doubt whether he ought not, in common justice, to walk UzelU off to the nearest station. But U Cecily felt grieved for a moment at the professor's impetuosity, the chUdUke deUght he felt in making up the httle quarrel was an ample recompense.

It may be safely asserted that the true feeling of these songs is not approached by one singer in twenty. Take Schuberts' \" Wanderer,\" or \" Serenade,\" for instance, and how often do we hear them really interpreted in their proper spirit ?

It was sad to see such pure and genial harmony interrupted by the discords of crime and misery, but so runs ever the \" still, sad, music of humanity.\" Side by side with life's gladdest notes, echoes the wail of misguided passion ; side by side with the golden dreams of youthful imagination, is muttered the wUd lament of age over a wasted past. So, by the changes of an hour, CecUy's sweet young life was shadowed with the blackness of despair. Meanwhile, Jack Edie had gone home from Fitzroy Square, full of excitement respecting her, and determined to call upon UzelU at the earUest opportunity and declare his passion. He had seen how watchful the old man had become of the"], [229, "cecily's housekeeping. 221 charming ghl, and knew weU enough how jealously he guarded her, so that no overtures might be made to her without his knowledge. The clock of St. Pancras Church told the young painter that it was not yet ten, before which hour, UzeUi, if caUed upon, was extremely snappish and inhospitable. The professor generally began the day with a thorough examination of the Times, choosing that journal mainly because its criticisms upon Art at that period were completely opposed to his own. By a series of letters, nine-tenths of which had never been inserted, he proved fto his own satisfaction at least) that the Times, in all matters relating to Art, was totally at sea. So restless was Edie, that nothing would persuade him for some time but that the clock had come to a standstill at a quarter-to-ten the day before yesterday. The result of a small wager with Arthur Joyce, together with five minutes' waiting, proved that it was ten minutes to the hour. Dressing himself carefully, the young painter started for Fitzroy Square, slightly discomposed by an old shoe, which Arthur threw"], [230, "222 LOST footsteps. after him, catching his right ear smartly, as he was about to close the front door. Edie's appearance was so much more gentlemanly than usual, that a quizzical smile played upon UzeUi's face when he entered the studio. Jack enquired with much deference if he could speak privately with the professor, at the same time casting an enquiring look around the studio, and wondering why Cecily was not there. \"Zere is nobody to come here, take a shair, and I vU hear vat you have to say \u2014 U it is money \u2014 bon jour, mon ami.\" \" My dear UzeUi, it is something of far greater importance to me than money. It cannot have escaped your notice, I should think, that from the day I first saw the charming young lady you have adopted, I was seized with an irresistible passion for her ; she appeared to me then, and she stiU appears, almost an angel.\" The young painter paused, in the hope of receiving some encouragement ; but the wrinkled face of the professor was as rigid as a block of marble. Edie, therefore, stood shivering upon the"], [231, "Cecily's housekeeping. 223 bank no longer, but plunged boldly in over head and ears. \" My dear professor, to make a short story of it, I am madly in love with CecUy ; and don't imagine, sir, that it is her beauty alone inspires me.

My own career has not been so consistent as it might have been \u2014 \" \" I tink not, indeed,\" was the professor's comment. \"But,\" continued Edie, \"I hope I am not unworthy of this happiness.\" \" Ah ! I guessed zis long time vat was de cause of so moche devotion to art, but I shall tink for some time about all zis. Zere is a most decided obstacle, my young friend, vich I shall not speak of to-day.\" There was but one idea entered Edie's brain when he heard this, and it was that UzeUi had the intention of soliciting CecUy 's hand himseU.

I know perfectly well that your motives in adopting Miss \u2014 Miss \u2014 \" Edie was quite at a loss, and UzeUi did not help him. He had known Cecily only by her maiden name, and was utterly ignorant of her past history. Indeed, he had considered nothing ; but, having conceived a violent passion, went straight to the fountain head at once. \"Don't be offended,\" said the professor, who was proud in his secret heart of the admiration excited by Cecily, \" I say noting if ze leetle maid have one spark of lose for you ; but for ze present dere is good reason to put de subject aside.

Edie continued in a very rapturous strain, but the professor was getting every moment more impatient, and interrupted him so frequently that he was compelled at length to leave very much in dudgeon because he had not seen Cecily herself. When he had gone, the professor shrugged his shoulders, as he watched him across the square and went sadly to his adopted daughter to consider what must be done to defend WoUe. He knew very Uttle of legal matters, beyond the polite attention he had occasionally received from the Sheriff of Middlesex, in the shape of a writ, and was ignorant whether he ought to caU upon the Lord Chief Justice or the Viee-Chancellor to defend Wolfe at the Old Bailey. 15 VOL. 11."], [234, "226 LOST FOOTSTEPS. Cecily's advice, however, that he might appeal to Mr. Joyce, put him in the highest spirits, and he wrote to that gentleman at once."], [235, "CHAPTER XVIII.

These striking objects"], [236, "228 LOST FOOTSTEPS. were reflected in a purple-tinted river, and stood out in bold rehef against an indigo sky, and redbrick sunset. The sketch had barely cost Edie an hour's labour, and was calculated to give his pupil some brilliant ideas of the glories of nature. \" It was so awfully slow in the Temple to-night, I could stand it no longer, Jack ; first, the organ in the chapel was droning and humming hke a waggon-load of bluebottles, and a plaintive gentleman opposite was tootling the Austrian national hymn on the flute, while my landlady's daughter refreshed me by singing the evening hymn, considerably out of tune, and afterwards thumping the Old Hundredth on the piano.

Having no definite object in view, they walked on the bridge for an hour, smoking and chatting, until night came on, and the moon rose. The soft moonlight made the scene almost poetical, for the river being calm and stUl, reflected a thousand fantastic shadows and quaint outlines. The arches of the bridge mirrored on the surface of the stream, made it appear almost of unfathomable depth, and the long lines of Ught that glowed across the current, gave an idea of space and mystery, which could not be obtained in the daylight.

Why did'nt we give UzeUi a look in ?\" \" No go ! The old boy shuts up the studio on Sundays now.\" \" What next, I wonder ?\" exclaimed Arthur. As they returned to the Strand it was getting late, and they remarked that the passengers had greatly increased ; numbers of men, women, and children, were pushing towards the City, all seeming intent upon some special object. Making an enquiry of a poUceman, as they passed, they"], [239, "231 A NIGHT IN THE OLD BAILEY. learned that an execution was to take place the following morning at the Old Bailey. With a morbid craving for anything in the shape of excitement, Arthur and Edie joined the hurrying crowd, and walked up the Strand. If any advocate of public executions passed with the motley groups on the way to the City, he must have been very obtuse indeed if he imagined there was any serious feeUng upon the subject in theh minds. One merely related to another his experience of executions in general, flavouring his narrative with a few choice oaths, and humming at the conclusion some fragment of a music haU chorus, or inviting his listeners to the nearest public-house ; while another speculated about the condemned man, as to whether he would \" die game,\" or whether he had made any confession ; or perhaps urged his companions not to delay, or they would'nt \" get a sight of the drop.\" The crowd became denser as they neared the City, and when they reached the Old BaUey, it was with no little difficulty they forced theh"], [240, "232 LOST FOOTSTEPS. way through the narrow thoroughfare. There seemed to be no special awe or horror amongst the crowd. Rough jokes were bandied about, and gin palaces all along the road were full of noisy merry-makers \u2014 that was reaUy the name to give them. Arthur and Edie were by no means immaculate in theh morality, but it was not without a shudder they saw the terrible indifference of the people assembled there. They were mostly so dirty in theh persons, and brutal in theh manners, that the young men, adopting the suggestion of a good-tempered poUceman, went into a tavern, and took places at the upper windows. It was no easy task to get through the bar, which was choked with turbulent customers, more or less intoxicated, and venting hideous blasphemy with every second word they uttered.

It was past midnight when they entered it, and for an hour or so they sat without much to attract theh attention, beyond the incessant buzz and hum of the crowd, varied by shriU cries from the women, for there were plenty of the other sex mingled with the mob, who, to judge by theh haU-fainting looks, and frequent outcries, met with no very gentle treatment.

As the glare from the torches feU upon the upturned faces of the mob, a fierce yeU broke from them, whether in consequence of the pressure, the intense excitement, or a kind of savage pleasure that the work was actually in progress, it was hard to say ; but the sound of it, coming as it"], [243, "235 A NIGHT IN THE OLD BAILEY. did immediately after the first clash of the workmen's tools upon the scaffold, seemed to convey the latter impression.

Drovers argued the great question of the right of way, as they journeyed with cattle, sheep, and pigs, to market ; plough men swore over it as they turned the furrows; mowers whetted theh scythes to it, and shop keepers mixed it with quotations of sugar, soap, and candles; one side thinking Mr. Hope an injured man, the other applauding the church wardens, and looking forward to a great reduction"], [277, "269 PAROCHIAL. of taxes, now that Sarah Pilgrim's brandy was prohibited.

A Darkened Mind. In the scientific and mechanical world there are frequently great, though at times scarcely per ceptible, influences at work, which are ever urging forward the more eager and enthusiastic minds. It need, therefore, hardly be wondered at that men, from time to time, becoming ahve to these influences, betake themselves to new fields of action, new outlets for experiment and adventure. In the world of thought there are simUar upheavings, which to sluggish natures, content to travel in the grooves laid down for them by theh ancestors, seem like the shocks of a moral earthquake, after the formulas and Umitations which they have submitted to so long.

They wiU say very likely, that it has dwarfed theh ideas, lowered theh aims, and curtaUed theh enjoyments ; and having borne the yoke of civUization till its pressure has become endurable no longer, have reached that phase in the moral, which sometimes occurs in the material world, when it seems the highest philosophy and truest wisdom to foUow the new path, and see whither it wUl lead.

This physical and moral discontent daily increases with the increasing growth of our enormous cities; and problems arise, which our received theories of Use, our established forms of society, cannot solve.

They have seen the scantiest rewards for the labours of a lifetime, they have siokened with the wearisome competition, the incessant struggle, the long delay, and they welcome any change, even if it brings unknown dangers and difficulties. Those whose labour is of the brain rather than of the hand, display a more decided restlessness than those who only suffer physically. All manner of doubts and anxieties afflict them. They turn to the sublime mysteries and consolations of religion, and are distracted between many advisers. One whispers of comfort and peaoe in a course, which to another seems assured damnation.

They have analyzed the hopes and aims of the society that rejects them, and have found them to be mainly weak, and often wicked, and have turned aside with ill-concealed impatience from the path civilization would have chalked out for them.

This bitterness is especially felt by those who, through disappointment or calamity, become isolated in the heart of a great city. Adrian, as we have seen, had not always at command the patience and self-control necessary to combat such impressions. He strove hard, it is true, to conquer his passionate regret, but there were times when he chafed under the burden tiU it became almost intolerable, and then it seemed to him that his sole chance of relief might be in flying from the civilization which, instead of balm, seemed to pour poison into the wounds of his sensitive nature.

He had voluntarily withdrawn from the society of Louise as soon as it was ascertained that M. Morel would probably recover. The singular events in which he had been a prominent actor had served to banish from his mind all feelings of animosity ; and, indeed, as GuiUume Morel became stronger in physical health, there was a change perceivable which made Adrian full of compassion for him, and very tolerant toward his former faUings. It was noticed during his recovery that his brain had become so weakened, that it was difficult at times to make him comprehend the simplest facts. OccasionaUy for a few moments he would give rational answers to any questions put to him, but if aroused suddenly from a peculiar brooding humour, which was habitual to him, he relapsed again immediately into a wandering vacant state, and spoke hke one who was uttering his dreams aloud, often describing the most incongruous"], [285, "277 A DARKENED MIND. scenes, and conjuring up the most grotesque images. They were glad to believe (and it must always be consoling in similar instances) that the intellect might be disordered without causing unhappiness or bodily suffering. Frequently it would seem, by M. Morel's amused looks, or by a sudden out burst of laughter, that his vague fancies were not unpleasing to him. He would, in these moods, appear to meet old acquaintances, old companions, and would murmur his gladness at seeing them again. At other times he would give vent to exclamations of merriment or surprise, as though listening to a strange anecdote, or exciting adventure. Louise met this new and unexpected trial with a fortitude which astonished her friends ; watching her husband, and carefully studying his various caprices, as a mother might have humoured the whims of a fancUul child.

It is so common to assume that these qualities belong chiefly to the ascetic and morose, that we are often surprised at seeing them in more ardent temperaments. Even Mr. Joyce, though always disposed to think highly of Louise, was astonished at her devotion to the man who had so recklessly marred her happiness. Louise was sustained in no inconsiderable degree by the knowledge of Adrian's intense and unchanging affection for her. It was a source of hourly happiness to feel herseU thus beloved, though for that very reason she bestowed increased attention upon her husband, and something of that tenderness filled her heart as she watched him, which Lowell so powerfully depicts in his poem \" The Darkened Mind\" : \u2014 The fire is burning clear and blithely, Pleasantly whistles tbe winter wind ; We are about thee, thy friends and kindred, On us all flickers the firelight kind ; There thou sittest in thy wonted corner Lone and awful in thy darkened mind.

Her feelings towards Adrian were not those of a woman who anticipated 6he would one day become his wife.

Percival Hope was a Uttle old-fashioned in some of his views, but he looked at the great problems of life with a judgment uninfluenced by extraneous circumstances. He was very tolerant, especially to the poor ; he had not perhaps a friendly eye for the Sunday newspapers, and would rather have seen their readers at church ; but he was aware that it was often the poor labourer's only way of acquiring information, and that it at least kept him away from the alehouse and the society of poachers, loungers, and tramps. The unseemly way in which he had been treated by Mr. Gabriel, though it pained him for the moment, had no permanent influence over him. He went amongst his poor parishioners during the week, and preached his sermon on Sunday with the composure of a man whose best reward is to feel that he had done his duty. His advice to Adrian was decisive.
