The Queen of Night, wrapped in her glistening robe, was shining brightly in an Italian sky : her light filled the long low room with shadows, and by it the violin and violin-player were plainly visible. The room was quaintly furnished : neither richly nor poorly, but with infinite taste. It seemed to belong in every detail to the tall, slight girl who moved about it so gracefully \u2014 the girl whose soul seemed filled by a deathless poem, which found utterance in the sobbing and sighing of the music. She was dressed very simply : her gray gown fell about her in soft folds, and looked very graceful and artistic ; a white muslin handkerchief was crossed over her breast, but just sufficiently open to show the long perfectly- rounded throat, encircled by B"], [10, "2 ah, che la morte ! one string of Roman pearls ; and mingling with her dusky hair were bands of silver, bands that flashed in the moonlight. A dark Italian face, with soft curves and faint colouring, and eyes in whose depths a man's heart might be lost hopelessly and for ever ; they were an index to the passionate soul within, full of pathos and capable of infinite suffering, desperate, reckless, indescribably beautiful. Gradually the melody died away. She laid her violin on the chair beside her, and thus she spoke, and her voice was like all else about her, indescribable : \" The Signor is late this night, Flippo.\" She spoke in English, but with a strong foreign accent. At the sound of her voice there was a movement in the far corner of the room, and then the figure of a child emerged from the shadows. His dark eyes were fixed upon her with a strange fascination, full of fierce suffering and hopeless adoration, like the eyes of a dog that has incurred the displeasure of his master, or been put aside for a more favoured rival. The child crawled to her and crouched at her feet, kissing her hand. His answer was given in a low tone, and in the language of his own country. \" Flippo,\" said the girl reprovingly, \" why wilt thou not speak to me in English ? the tongue that I love, the tongue we have both learned for the Signor's sake. Poor little Flippo,\" she added compassionately, \"thou art too jealous, little one. Thinkest thou my heart is too small to hold both thee and my love ? Thou knowest what thou art to me, Flippo.\""], [11, "AH, CHE LA MORTE ! 3 Her fingers strayed lovingly in his black hair. \" Thy shadow and thy slave,\" answered the boy in English, obedient to her command. She stooped and kissed him. As her beautiful curved lips touched his forehead a thrill went through him, and his big mournful eyes filled with tears of gratitude. \"A kiss for me, even me,\" he said brokenly, \"thine own gift and my possession \u2014 something of which the Signor cannot rob me, mine own always.\" She smiled. \" The Signor has too many to grudge thee one.\" \" Yet he does not value his thousands as I my one,\" exclaimed the child fiercely. \"Of late he has had all thy kisses, Signora ; thou hast forgotten Flippo.\" \"No, no,\" she said; \"when we go over the seas to England, Flippo and my violin will go too ; I could not be happy without either.\" As she spoke some one walked leisurely up the steps, opened the door without ceremony, and came into the room. It was an Englishman, tall and thin, indolent and handsome ; a heavy dark moustache covered a hard mouth, his eyes varied in expression with every thought and almost every word he uttered. His clothes were somewhat shabby, his whole air careless and elegant. \"Am I late, Gitana?\" he asked, trying to speak lightly. \" The time seemed long without thee,\" she an swered, with her whole soul in her eyes."], [12, "4 AH, CHE LA MORTE ! The gentleman avoided looking at her ; he threw his hat on the table and himself on the sofa. \" I have been answering a lot of tiresome letters,\" he said ; \" the employment has not improved my temper.\" A rather startled look came into her eyes. \"English letters always worry you, dearest,\" she said ; \" shall I play to you ? \u2014 that so often brings you rest.\" \"For heaven's sake, no!\" he answered pettishly ; \" my nerves are not in a state to bear it to-night. Besides, I have a good many things to say to you.\" She kneeled down beside him with a sweet patient smile on her face. \"If they are not pleasant things, let us put them off a little,\" she said softly ; \" they will do when the lamp comes. Let us enjoy the moonlight and be happy.\" \"Unpleasant things are best got over at once,\" he answered sharply; \" this light suits them as well as any other.\" \" They were as usual in your uncle's letter,\" she said half-questioningly. \" Yes. The fact is, he wants me to return to Ens land at once ; his doctors say he may die at any moment, and the shock of the announcement has upset him. He is also anxious for my marriage to take place as soon as possible (I told you I was engaged to be married to my cousin when I left England ; I am generally supposed to be engaged to her still). Pleasant state of things altogether, is not it ?\" \" It will all come right,\" she said confidently. \" When do we start for England, Laurence?\""], [13, "AH, CHE LA M0RTE ! 5 \"We!\" he exclaimed, aghast; \"you don't surely imagine it possible I can take you with me, do you ? If I wanted to ruin myself utterly, that is the very course I should pursue. Fancy going to my uncle in his present state of health, and calmly informing him I had been privately married for the last three months to a young lady of doubtful antecedents, with whom I struck up a casual acquaintance behind the scenes at a concert \u2014 a young lady whose only possessions are a miserable little beggar-boy whom she has rescued out of the gutter, and a violin on which she plays divinely !\" He spoke bitterly and contemptuously. The girl rose to her feet, quivering in every nerve, her eyes dilated with a great agony. \" You will not do it?\" she said beseechingly; \" you will not leave me behind to die?\" \"It will take more than that to kill you,\" he said carelessly. \" It is only a matter of keeping quiet, going on with your music, and waiting until I come back.\" \" Laurie,\" she cried, stretching out her hands appealingly to him, \"have mercy upon me, my dearest, and take me with you ! Laurie, have pity ! I will not be any trouble or expense ; I can earn my own living in England as well as here. Tell your people, who are rich and great, that you have married a wife who loves you, who lives only for you, and who would die for you \u2014 a wife whose whole heart is yours now and for ever.\" \"You do not in the least understand the matter,\" returned her companion. \" In England we do not"], [14, "6 AH, CHE LA MORTE ! think highly of lifelong devotion and that kind of thing ; we prefer money and position. I am afraid my people would not appreciate you.\" There was a short pause. The girl's voice broke it. \" You will not take me ?\" She spoke hopelessly, despairingly, her eyes fixed upon his face. \" I thought I made that clear to you before. I must go to England alone, and afterwards try to make some arrangement about you, I suppose.\" He said it dejectedly, as if the whole affair were a burden and a perplexity. \" You will go to England and marry your cousin,\" she said stonily, \" and I shall never see you any more.\" \"Make your mind easy on that point,\" he retorted, laughing bitterly. \" I have no fancy for being tried upon the respectable charge of bigamy \u2014 one wife is quite enough for any man at once. The idea of going about with one's second wife in perpetual expectation of meeting one's first would be enough to drive any man mad; carrying about a fatal secret which one knew might at any time be revealed \u2014 living over a mine which in a second might be sprung. I would rather die than endure such a life.\" As he uttered those fatal words, words that bore Buch important fruit, and had such a terrible sig nificance in his after life, there was a slight movement in the curtains about the windows. Both he and his companion were much too excited to notice it. \" When may I follow you, Laurie ?\" she asked, fall-"], [15, "AH, CHE LA MORTE ! 7 ing on her knees beside him, and twining her arms about his neck. \" 0 my darling, I will work so hard, and soon earn enough money to come. 0, how happy we shall be !\" He shuddered at the suggestion. \" Do you want to destroy every prospect I have in the world ?\" he asked roughly. \" You must be mad to speak of it.\" \"I think I have been mad,\" she said, with a wild laugh that ended in a sob ; \" I have been mad enough to fancy that you loved me, and I know now you despise me \u2014 that you are ashamed of your wife.\" She had fallen back upon the floor, her arms thrown above her head, her eyes closed, and a deathly pallor upon her face. Her hair escaped from the silver bands which held it, and fell about her neck. The utter abandonment and despair in her attitude was full of a mute appeal. The gentleman called Laurie raised her in his arms and laid her on the sofa. \"Don't make a scene,\" he said more gently. \"I need not start till the day after to-morrow. I shall see you again.\" \" So soon ! so soon !\" she moaned. \" 0, why did I not die this morning, when I was happy ! It would be best for us both if I were dead.\" He did not answer. He was moving slowly towards the door. She rose from the sofa and tottered after him."], [16, "8 AH, CnE LA MORTE ! \" Do not be angry with me,\" she cried piteously ; \" I love you so.\" \" I am not angry,\" he returned. \" The fact is, there is a fellow staying at the hotel who knows me ; he leaves early to-morrow morning. I promised to see him again to-night ; it will not do for him to get the slightest suspicion of your existence. Good-night. Make up your mind to the inevitable as well as you can. I shall see you to-morrow.\" He passed out of the room and down the stairs, leaving her standing there in all her beauty and all her despair, gazing after him, the wife he had wooed, won, wedded, and of whom he had grown tired in six short months. A great trembling shook her in every limb ; she swayed like a reed shaken by the wind, and, falling on her face, her arms stretched out towards the being who had been in one her god and her ruin, she poured forth the anguish of her tortured soul in one word \u2014 \"Laurence !\" And the calm white light of the moon looked down upon her coldly, mockingly, and upon the child, with the wonderful dark eyes alternately fierce and mournful, the child Flippo, whose little life she in her infinite pity had saved. He had crawled to her, and was silently kissing her hand. The Englishman walked leisurely down the road, his hands in his pockets, his head bowed dejectedly on his breast."], [17, "AH, CHE LA M0RTE ! 9 \" What a mess I have made of my life !\" he said to himself. \"What a fatal quixotic mistake it was to marry this girl ! I think her intense beauty drove me completely mad. She will inevitably follow me sooner or later, and ruin every prospect I have in life. My uncle will disinherit me, my friends will cut me ; I shall have to choose between work or starvation : the one seems as objectionable as the other. Work!\" He held out his white hand and looked compassion ately at it. After a little time his steps led him towards the lake \u2014 the calm silver lake that looked so peaceful in the moonlight. He took off his hat, that the night air might cool his throbbing temples. \" I wish her words did not haunt me so,\" he said half aloud. \" I can hear her saying over and over again, ' It would be best for us both if I were dead ;' the whole night seems ringing with them. I wish to Hea ven she had never uttered them ; they remind me so horribly that nothing but death can end my bondage.\" He turned abruptly away, and walked rapidly to his hotel. His friend was out. \" Bring me some brandy,\" he said to the waiter; \" I will have it in my room.\" The man ventured a remark. \" You are ill, sir,\" he said ; \" can I do anything for you ?\" \"No!\" he answered sharply; and then, suddenly catching sight of his face in the glass, he started, laugh ing harshly. \" I have a headache,\" he observed, and went up- stairs,"], [18, "10 AH, CHE LA MORTE ! For years afterwards there were those who remem bered that night, and the wild weird music that broke in upon their dreams, the music of the old violin. It came from the quaintly-furnished room that held never a tenant more. Some say it was phantom music ; some that it was the Divine Musician. It rose and fell, it sobbed and shrieked ; sometimes it was intensely sweet, at others so pathetic that those who heard it found their pillows wet with tears. They speak of that night with awe now, and cross themselves. \"It was the dirge of Death,\" they say. END OF PROLOGUE."], [19, "&{>e Storn CHAPTER I. FIVE YEARS AFTER Vanlyn ! is it possible ?\" The scene, the Row ; the month, July ; the time, one o'clock. The man who thus accosted Mr. Vanlyn looked somewhat of a Bohemian. Mr. Vanlyn did not. The latter was a tall, thin man, with finely cut fea tures, and a broad, high forehead ; his moustache, which covered a hard mouth, was very thick and long. There was generally a bitter cynical look on his face, as if he had found life a disappointment ; but having dispensed with its weaknesses, or rather permanently overcome them, he smiled with mingled pity and con tempt upon those of his fellow-creatures who had not attained to his own exalted height, and were still struggling with their loves and hates, hopes and fears, joys and sorrows ; in a word, those who were not experienced philosophers like himself. He was dressed very carefully and very well : in stinctively you would have known him to be a \" man about town,\" a man who was probably sought after"], [20, "12 FIVE YEARS AFTER. in society, and who accepted invitations condescend ingly and carelessly, and received a large number in consequence. A lion in his way, who condescended to roar for the public edification, and was profnsely thanked for doing so. \" Ah ! how do you do, Talbot ?\" he said. \" Glad to see you back again.\" His companion glanced from his own somewhat unconventional attire to his friend's faultless get up, and smiled. \"It is quite pleasant to see old England again,\" he said, \"quite pleasant to meet one's friends and return to civilisation, after five years of a Bohemian existence in half the cities of the habitable globe.\" \" Have you really been away for so long ?\" asked Mr. Vanlyn. \" Really, and now I have returned I am naturally burning with the desire to hear what has been hap pening to this great Babylon, and the inhabitants thereof, in my absence. I knowT no man more likely to be up in the latest intelligence than yourself. If you have nothing better to do, come and lunch with me to-day.\" One of Mr. Vanlyn 's characteristics was that he never did anything in a hurry. He looked at his watch before he replied to his companion. \" What time do you lunch ?\" he said. \" Whenever I chance to get home.\" \" Thanks. I shall be happy to join you.\" Did I say that Mr. Vanlyn's manner, although it"], [21, "FIVE YEARS AFTER. 13 conveyed a suspicion of patronage, was, when he chose, so pleasant as to amount almost to fascination ? If I did not, I will do so now. This circumstance was accounted for by the fact that his heaven was popu larity, and no devoted anchorite ever studied his path more closely, or strove to walk therein more carefully, than did Mr. Vanlyn in his. Most of the women of his acquaintance, young and old, married and single, were attracted by him, and he smiled down upon them from the little pedestal upon which they had placed him. \"Five years !\" said Mr. Talbot meditatively; \"let me see, when I went away you were daily expected home from Italy to see the last of your uncle, and marry your cousin. I suppose by this time the poor old fellow is dead and buried, and you have blossomed into a family man ?\" \" My uncle was dead when I returned to England,\" said Mr. Vanlyn. \" My cousin did the most sensible thing she could do, and married some one else; she is now in Australia, and I am supporting existence in the capacity of an unencumbered, and consequently unhappy, bachelor.\" \"You seem to support it tolerably well,\" said Mr. Talbot. \"I am still in sixes and sevens,\" he con tinued. \" I came home rather suddenly, so told my servants to prepare only the study and my bedroom. You will put up with things as they are, won't you ?\" All through luncheon Mr. Talbot entertained his"], [22, "14 FIVE YEARS AFTER. guest with the account of his travels ; after luncheon he handed him a cigar. \"Take the easy-chair,\" he said; \"from my recol lection of you, I know you to be a man of artistic taste and ideas. I am possessed with a great desire to submit to your critical judgment some of my sketches. I have not been idle during my five years' absence.\" He unlocked a portfolio as he spoke, and held up one of the drawings. \"You get a peep of Mont Blanc in that,\" he said; \"you recognise it, of course?\" \" 0 yes, unmistakably.\" They went through most of the paintings, Mr. Vanlyn criticising or praising, as the case might be. The last picture in the portfolio was turned face downwards. At the same moment that Mr. Vanlyn took it in his hand, his host rose from his chair. \" Have another glass of claret ?\" he said. When he turned round again, the ghastly pallor on his visitor's face both startled and alarmed him. \"Good Lord, Vanlyn!\" he exclaimed, \"what is the matter?\" \" It is really nothing,\" returned Mr. Vanlyn faintly ; \"I am subject to these attacks : pray don't disturb yourself on my account.\" Talbot clashed the bell. \" Bring some brandy,\" he said to the servant. Vanlyn was leaning back in the easy-chair, with"], [23, "15 FIVE YEARS AFTER. his eyes closed ; the cigar, which he had a second before been smoking, lay on the floor ; the pictures scattered about, some on the table and chairs, one or two lay on the floor ; everything was in precisely the same state as when Mr. Talbot turned his back to pour out the claret, even down to the picture face downwards in the portfolio. The only change was the ghastly and almost instantaneous change in the man before him. After Vanlyn had swallowed a small quantity of brandy the colour began slowly to return to his face. He passed his handkerchief across his forehead and smiled at his companion. \" I am awfully sorry to have alarmed you,\" he said ; \" oblige me by forgetting it as soon as you can ; as I told you, I am subject to sudden faintness. This attack is probably the result of indigestion occasioned by your lobster-salad.\" He spoke lightly, but Mr. Talbot still regarded him uneasily. \" Have you consulted a doctor?\" he asked. Vanlyn finished the brandy in his glass and rose from his chair. \"I don't believe in doctors,\" he said. \"If there is anything serious the matter with me, I would rather not know it ; and if there is not, I don't require a doctor ; as I said before, oblige me by forgetting all about it and blame the lobster-salad. I know you will not think me rude if I run away ; I promised to meet a man at my club at half-past three.\""], [24, "16 FIVE YEARS AFTER. \" You will come again ?\" said Mr. Talbot ; \" I have another portfolio full of paintings to show you.\" \" You are very good, but I am really no judge of pictures ; show them to some one who is more capable of criticising them.\" The words, and the tone in which they were uttered, astonished Mr. Talbot. \" If Vanlyn were bored with looking at the pictures,\" he thought, \" he might have had the civility to conceal it.\" After his guest had gone Talbot replaced them in the portfolios, lighted another cigar, and sat down to think. It is possible Mr. Vanlyn's sudden attack of faintness might have passed entirely from his mind but for a circumstance which reminded him of it some hours later in the clay. An old friend named Dr. Froom had been dining with him. In his youth Dr. Froom had travelled a great deal, and consequently took considerable interest in the relation of his host's adventures and reminiscences of the various places which he had himself, in bygone days, visited. For the second time Talbot produced his portfolio. The sight of it brought Vanlyn back to his mind. \" By the bye,\" he said, \" Laurence Vanlyn lunched with me to-day. He strikes me as being a good deal altered since I saw him last.\" Dr. Froom smiled. \" That is more than probable,\" he returned; \" six years alter us all. Vanlyn is no exception to the rule.\""], [25, "FIVE YEARS AFTER. 17 Talbot left the paintings and relighted his pipe. \" You have seen something of him of late years, I suppose?\" he said. \" Has it ever struck you he inherit ed his uncle's complaint as well as his uncle's fortune ?\" \"Heart-disease ?\" \"Yes.' Dr. Froom laughed. \" I am in a position to answer that question with great certainty. My answer is, certainly not. Only two months ago I had to extract a piece of glass from one of Vanlyn's hands. The operation was a painful one, and he particularly wished to have chloroform. I positively declined to administer it unless I first ascertained that I could do so with safety. Vanlyn placed himself unreservedly in my hands, provided he might have the chloroform. I made the necessary examination, and afterwards administered it with per fect confidence and success.\" Talbot returned to the portfolio. \" Vanlyn was taken suddenly faint this afternoon,\" he said. \" The only possible way I could account for the attack was that his heart was affected.\" Dr. Froom's answer was given in a few words, and was eminently to the point. \"Vanlyn has no more heart-disease than I have,\" he said. \" If you want to find out the cause of his sudden attack of faintness, you must look somewhere else.\" He had scarcely finished speaking when the door opened, and the butler announced, \" Mr. Vanlyn.\" c"], [26, "CHAPTER II. A DEAD FACE It is needless to say the announcement profoundly surprised both gentlemen. Talbot concealed his aston ishment with well-bred tact. \"We were just talking of you,\" he said. \"It is friendly of you to make up for your flying visit this after noon by giving us the pleasure of your society this evening.\" \"You are very kind,\" returned Vanlyn, with com plete self-possession. \" Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to spend the evening with you, but unfortunately I am engaged. I only called in on my way to ask if you cared to go with me to-morrow to the house of a friend of mine, who is possessed of a very fine collection of pictures. In my poor judgment it is well worth your while to give them an hour or two, if you have that amount of spare time at your disposal.\" He spoke easily and pleasantly, and had obviously recovered so completely from his indisposition of the afternoon that both gentlemen for the time forgot the occurrence. \"You know my weakness,\" said Talbot, smiling; \"it is good of you to indulge it. The sight of your friend's pictures will give me infinite pleasure.\" \" May I inquire what magnetic attraction is strong enough to draw you away from our delightful society ?\" asked Dr. Froom. \" A feminine one, I conclude ?\""], [27, "A DEAD FACE. 19 Vanlyn laughed. \"You are wrong,\" he said; \"it is nothing more exciting than a game of whist with a few kindred spirits.\" \" Then let them get on without you for a short time, and have a cigar with us,\" urged Talbot, handing him the box. Mr. Vanlyn magnanimously acceded to the request with the air of a man who is conferring a favour rather than partaking of hospitality. His next remark surprised Talbot almost more than his reappearance had done. It took the form of a request to see the contents of the second portfolio. \"If I stay,\" he said, \"you must reward me by a view of the remainder of your paintings. You told me this afternoon you had some more. If they are as clever and interesting as the others, Froom will have as great a treat as I shall.\" \" I was afraid I bored you with them this after noon,\" said Talbot. \"Say rather you filled me with envy ; it would be nearer the mark.\" Talbot was flattered ; his pictures were his weak ness, their commendation his delight. \" They are in the other room,\" he said. \" Pray help yourself to some brandy-and-soda while I fetch them.\" Vanlyn availed himself of the suggestion, and then addressed Dr. Froom. \" You have seen the contents of that portfolio, of course ?\" he said."], [28, "20 A DEAD FACE. \" I havo seen nothing at present,\" was the answer. \" We were about to look at it when you came in.\" \" I owe you my best apologies for delaying anything so pleasant,\" he returned, with a laugh. He seemed in the best of spirits and full of hearty appreciation, making comments upon the pictures which left no doubt that he was well up in the subject of art. By this time Dr. Froom had arrived at a conclusion : to-morrow's invitation was not the object, but the excuse, of Mr. Vanlyn's visit. \"Froom tells me he has not seen your other pictures,\" said Vanlyn, knocking the ashes off the end of his cigar with the extreme end of his little finger, and blowing a thin cloud of blue smoke from his lips. \" Show them now, there's a good fellow, and give me another chance of feasting my artistic soul upon a second glimpse of ' Lake Leman by moonlight.' \" Talbot was in his element, Dr. Froom silent and appreciative, Laurence Vanlyn the most high-spirited and merry of the three. \" Let me be showman,\" he said, going to the pictures. \" I am as good as a descriptive catalogue. Froom, oblige me by considering yourself for the time a ' Cook's tourist.' If my eloquence and Talbot's brush do not succeed in transporting you into the land of dreams, poetry, and music, it will be your loss, not our fault.\" Talbot lighted a fresh pipe and smiled amusedly. \" It is a fair division of labour,\" he said. \" I have done my part ; let me be lazy while you do yours.\""], [29, "21 A DEAD FACE. Vanlyn did his remarkably well. He described very pleasantly some of the phases of Italian life ; he spoke of sunsets and sunrises, of blue skys and bluer lakes, of the songs of birds and the charm of moonlight nights. He interspersed his description with soft musical lines of Italian poetry, and concluded with a graphic account of a service at St. Peter's, that grand cathedral in a grand city, till both his hearers felt something of awe and reverence creeping over them. They had come to the last picture in the portfolio. Vanlyn took it in his hand, looked at it, and broke into a merry laugh. \"What have we here, Talbot?\" he exclaimed; \" why did you not show it to me this afternoon? Have I surprised a secret about which I must be as silent as the grave ?\" Talbot did not join in the laugh. The awe which had to some extent crept over him was not dispelled by the sight of the picture. \"Ah, poor child!\" he said. \"Is it not a lovely face ? so pure and innocent, full of such intense pathos, capable of so much suffering.\" Vanlyn was still holding the picture in his hand, contemplating it with a smile on his face. \"I am afraid you were rather hard hit,\" he said. \" If it is not an impertinent question, may I ask why you speak of the young lady in such compassionate terms ?\" He handed the sketch to Dr. Froom, and helped himself to another cigar."], [30, "22 A DEAD FACE. \" I never spoke to her in my life,\" said Talbot musingly, aud relapsed into silence once more. \" That was an act of folly of which I imagined you incapable,\" said Vanlyn ; \" if you will oblige me with her address, I shall certainly make better use of my opportunities than you did of yours.\" He looked sharply at Talbot. There was just a shade more eagerness in his tone than was quite to be accounted for by the casual sight of a pretty face sketched on a piece of drawing-paper. For the third time Talbot avoided a direct reply. \" She played the violin divinely,\" he said, still musingly; \"no music ever touched my heart in the same way.\" Vanlyn stuck to his point. He tried another direct question. \"She has altered a good deal since that sketch was made, perhaps,\" he said : \" may I ask how long it is since you saw her ?\" \" More than six years,\" answered Talbot. \" I shall never see her again. She is dead.\" As he mentioned the number of years Dr. Froom fancied a look of relief crossed Vanlyn's face. \"Dead!\" he cried; \"how very sad! You might have spared me a disappointment by mentioning the fact before.\" Dr. Froom silently laid the sketch on the table, and glanced again at Vanlyn. \" What did she die of?\" he asked : \"I could not imagine any commonplace disease carrying her off, she"], [31, "23 A DEAD FACE. looks too spiritual. One would expect to hear that she gradually evaporated into thin air, or floated away some misty morning into the clouds on the wings of her wonderful music.\" \" She had a story,\" said Talbot : \" Iheard it two years ago when I wasin Italy. If you care to hear it, you shall.' Vanlyn rose, replaced the sketch in the portfolio, and sat clown again in the armchair. \" Is it very affecting?\" he asked, smiling. \" Shall I require another dose of brandy-and-soda to help me through it?\" The gaiety of his manner struck Dr. Froom as being excessive. If Laurence Vanlyn had been acting, he would have pronounced the performance a trifle over done. Instantly Vanlyn divined his thoughts. \"Pray help yourself,\" said Talbot. \"No, no, my dear fellow, it was only my joke; get on with the story of your enchanting violinist, or I shall have to go away in the middle, leaving it at the most thrilling part, like the serials, ' To be continued in our next.' \" \" Well, about six years ago I chanced to be in Rome. One evening I had nothing particular to do, and having heard that a concert was going to take place, I deter mined to go to it. It was not a very grand one, and was given in aid of some charitable object. I sat there listening to the, music, thinking more of my own con cerns than anything else, listening in a sort of dream, from which I was aroused by a nudge from my next door neighbour."], [32, "24 A DEAD FACE. \" ' Here she is,' he said\u2014' this is her first appear ance in public. These music-loving people will go mad about her, if her playing is as exquisite as her face.' \"He was an Englishman. I have often wondered since if he had any influence over her after life. The applause of the audience was mild but encouraging. \" I looked at Signora Gitana. I can no more de scribe her to you than that faint sketch can give you even the faintest idea of her beauty. She was an in spiration, the ideal of a dream. She began to play, and the applause ceased : the audience were spell bound, enchanted. When at last it came to an end we all knew that Signora Gitana's reputation as a musician was established. As for me, I cannot describe the effect the playing had upon me, except that I could not stay to hear other performers ; the tears were in my eyes. I watched her leave the platform, and then I left also. Half the night I walked about Rome with that divine music ringing in my heart. I often heard her play afterwards, but the music never lost its influence over me. I took that sketch of her the second time I saw her, and added finishing touches on each occasion afterwards. Then I left Rome. Two years ago I re visited it, and inquired for the Signora : they told me she was dead. \" It seems that soon after I left she also left Rome, and went to a quiet little place beside the sea. From time to time an English gentleman went to see her, and with him she ultimately came to her death. She"], [33, "25 A DEAD FACE. was an orphan, and lived quite alone with a little boy as friendless as herself, whom she had rescued from starvation, and taken to live with her. The child loved her devotedly in the passionate way Italians can and do love. There seems to be no doubt that she was married to the Englishman. The end of the story I heard from an old boatman. He said one bright moonlight night he was smoking his pipe upon the beach beside his boat, when he saw the English gen tleman coming towards him with some rugs on his arm, and the Signora by his side. They engaged the boat for a row, got into it, and put off. The boatman stood watching them, and he says he heard wild, wonder ful music coming to him across the water. He stood watching till he could see and hear them no longer, and then sat down to smoke again. It must have been half an hour afterwards he went to look for them, and thought he saw something struggling in the water. It was the Englishman swimming towards shore; he ap peared very much exhausted and agitated. The boat had capsized, and, but for his being able to swim, he would have shared the terrible fate of the unfortunate girl. Even now the boatmen fancy they can hear the wild sad music coming across the water, when the moon shines brightest.\" \" And the little lad,\" said Dr. Froom \u2014 \" what be came of him ?\" \" Curiously enough, he disappeared also. Some say that the Signora spirited him away by her playing ; others, that he threw himself into the sea after her."], [34, "26 A DEAD FACE. Another theory is that he found out she was going on the water, and, in his fierce jealousy and adoration, con cealed himself in the boat \u2014 so was drowned with her.\" \" Concealed himself in the boat !\" repeated Vanlyn ; \"then of course he was drowned, he must have been.\" \" Or rescued,\" said Dr. Froom. Mr. Vanlyn only said said one word, and he said it sharply and irritably\u2014\" Impossible !\" \" That is the end of my story,\" said Talbot. \" What do people say about the Englishman ?\" in quired Vanlyn. \" What became of him ?\" \" He left the next day, and has not been there since.\" \"Poor fellow! I should think not: after such a horrible accident his recollections would be too painful to induce him to visit the place again.\" The doctor's eyes were fixed keenly on Vanlyn. \"It was a narrow escape for him,\" he remarked; \" if the boatman had not chanced to see him, he might have been drowned.\" \" What was his name ?\" asked Vanlyn \"If it was ever known by the people there, they have forgotten it,\" returned Talbot; \"but I more than suspect, under the circumstances, the gentleman would not be too communicative upon the subject : the chances are, any name by which he was known was a fictitious one.\" \"I wonder if it was the fellow you sat next to at the concert ?\" said Vanlyn. He rose and looked at his watch as he spoke. \" A quarter to ten !\" he cried, in astonishment. \" What"], [35, "27 THE BELLS. will my friends say to me ? I must not stay another minute. May your servant call me a cab ?\" When he had gone Talbot returned to his remain ing guest. \" Nice fellow Vanlyn,\" he said reflectively. \" I am glad I happened to run across him. It was good of him coming out of his way like that to ask me to go and see his friend's pictures.\" \"Very,\" returned Dr. Froom dryly. CHAPTER III. \" THE BELLS \" Mr. Vanlyn was looking very ill ; upon that subject there could be no possible doubt. His friends com passionated him, and sent him invitations, all of which he accepted. The worse he looked the more he went out ; indeed, the one thing which appeared impossible to him was to stay at home alone. A month of extra excitement and sleepless nights brought him to Dr. Froom. \" I can't stand it any longer,\" he said irritably, \" and I won't ; give me some chloral, and let me have a good night's rest. Sleep is the one thing I want, and the more I -want it the farther I seem off getting it.\" Dr. Froom looked at his patient critically. \" Your nerves are thoroughly unstrung,\" he said, \" and in consequence you have been racketing about"], [36, "28 THE BELLS. from morning to night in the hope of curing yourself. Your treatment has proved a dead failure, and now you come to me, and ask for something which will make you ten times worse.\" Vanlyn's nerves were in that delightful condition that he yearned to quarrel with his own shadow, there fore he embraced this favourable opportunity of being uncomplimentary to a more substantial object. \" You doctors are no good at all,\" he said ; \" I was a fool to come to you. What is the use of telling a man he is a bundle of nerves, and had better go home and eat half a leg of mutton, when he has no more appe tite than a mummy ; or to go to bed at ten every night, and sleep till ten the next morning, when he is as rest less as the bears at the Zoo ? Don't you think it would be about as sensible to tell the lions in Trafalgar Square to roar at intervals ?\" The doctor walked to the hearthrug, put his hands under his coat-tails, looked at his boots, and smiled. \" Quite as sensible,\" he said, with provoking cool ness. \" I should be as likely to do one as the other. You have lost your appetite and are unable to sleep ; consequently you profess to come to me for advice, and proceed to order your own medicine, give your own opinion, and make yourself ill in your own way. Have your experiments been successful so far ?\" Mr. Vanlyn was obliged to admit they had not. \" Very well. Now answer me a few questions. Have you anything on your mind which comes to you in your solitary hours, and robs you of appetite and sleep ?\""], [37, "29 THE BELLS. A look of profound astonishment came into Mr. Vanlyn's eyes ; then he laughed heartily. \" What iu the world are you knocking your head against now?\" he asked; \"do I strike you as a likely fellow to convey about with him a skeleton? I am glad to say I do not possess anything so inconvenient or romantic. Of what do you suspect me ? coveting my neighbour's wife, or a reprehensible desire to marry my grandmother ?\" \" I suspect you of not being quite so ill as you imagine.\" \" That is satisfactory.\" \"Now, my advice is this: get out of London at once ; go to some pleasant, diverting place, where you will have plenty to amuse and entertain you without late hours, crowded rooms, the scent of sickly flowers, and champagne. Go in for ruralising ; take plenty of exercise, row, bathe, swim, go to bed early and get up early, read light books, and smoke moderately ; then you may hope to come back a different man in two months' time.\" \" I think I had better write the prescription down,\" said Vanlyn, with a smile, and beginning to scribble on the back of an envelope. \" Exercise, row, bathe, swim, early to bed, and early to rise, I think you said. Read and smoke \u2014 I can do the last two remarkably well ; I can row moderately, and I suppose I can bathe : is it absolutely necessary to insure my recovery that I should swim ?\" \" No,\" returned Dr. Froom amusedly ; \" I only"], [38, "30 THE BELLS. mentioned swimming as a pleasant and healthy form of exercise.\" \" You have taken a load off my mind,\" said Mr. Vanlyn, still in the same light tone, \" for the simple reason that I cannot swim a yard.\" He looked straight at the doctor ; the doctor looked straight at him. \" I have another piece of advice to give you : under those circumstances, when you go on the water take a boatman with you.\" \" You may be quite sure I shall not go without until I become more proficient in the art of rowing than I am at present. I have never been on the water without a boatman, or some one equally experienced, in my life.\" The sensation which the doctor experienced was not a pleasant one. He knew in his inmost heart he had harboured an unjust and ungenerous suspicion, and he felt heartily ashamed of himself. True, Laurence Vanlyn's own peculiarity of manner had suggested something that was not quite easy to explain; his sudden attack of faintness at Mr. Talbot's was also, to some extent, mysterious ; but the present state of his nerves might account for everything, and put a totally different complexion on the matter. Dr. Froom felt he owed an apology to Vanlyn, which, of course, it was perfectly impossible for him to make. He did the only thing in his power, he asked him to dinner. \" If you have nothing better to do,\" ha said, \" stay"], [39, "31 THE BELLS. and dine with me to-night ; a quiet evening will be good for you, and we can discuss this plan I have suggested. Every hour you remain in London means so much lost ground, which you will have trouble to regain.\" Vanlyn accepted the offer without his usual hesi tation. \" As you seem bent on disposing of me in your own way for the next two months,\" he said, \" perhaps you will give me some idea where I am to go ? Scar borough, Brighton, Hastings \u2014 where ?\" \" To none of them,\" returned Dr. Froom. \" Pro bably at any of those places you would meet a host of your London acquaintances, keep late hours, drink champagne, and racket about from morning to night, just as you do here. Go to some tolerably quiet place, where there is enough going on to amuse you ; get a glimpse into another life from the one which you have so long led ; mix with a totally different set of people, and you will find that you are being amused and enter tained without the slightest effort.\" \" I am afraid it won't answer,\" said Vanlyn ; \"you have no idea what a restless fellow I am. A miserable little watering-place filled with Cockney excursionists, who spend their days between eating bath-buns, pears, and sweetmeats, having their photographs taken in each other's hats, wading about in the sea minus shoes and stockings, and riding on donkeys which stagger under their burdens, is not in my line. That class of the British public is no doubt intensely interesting,"], [40, "32 THE BELLS. but I have hitherto had the misfortune to fail in seeing its attractions.\" \" That is your fault,\" said Dr. Froom ; \" try once more. If at the end of a week you find existence in such a place impossible, leave it, and return to the world of fashion. I do not suppose for a moment that the change I propose will be an agreeable one, but it will be a change, and that is what you want.\" \"I shall feel the truth of the assertion made by the old woman in Punch, ' There is never a change but for the worse,' \" said Vanlyn. \" Shall I tell you what will happen ? When I arrive at this health-restoring para dise I shall spend half the day looking for lodgings. Ultimately I shall secure a stuffy bedroom next the roof, the window of which obstinately declines to open, and a sitting-room where the odour of the other lodgers' meals, in process of cooking, stalks rampant. The other lodgers will be of the class who subsist chiefly on cabbages and onions. My bread-and-butter will be cut with an oniony knife, the water, which forms the prin cipal ingredient in my tea, will never boil, the domestic who waits upon me will be unwashed, a crying baby will occupy the next room to mine, and I shall discover at the end of a week that the last family who occupied my rooms were just recovering from smallpox. Then I shall pack my portmanteau and come back.\" Dr. Froom laughed. \" Let me vaccinate you before you go,\" he said. \" Under the circumstances you describe it would be a wise precaution.\""], [41, "33 THE BELLS. After dinner the conversation was resumed. \" You have not yet decided upon the place of my banishment,\" Vanlyn said; \"I am beginning to like less and less the idea of solitary lodgings in a place where I do not know a soul.\" \" Why not stay at an hotel ? You would be more likely to get decently cooked food and airy accommo dation.\" \"Hotel life, when you are alone, is only one degree less dreary than existence in lodgings. People keep to themselves, as a rule, and you feel out in the cold. There is, however, generally an exception in the person of a terrible bore, either male or female, who button holes you at every turn, and persists in thrusting his or her company upon you on all occasions. This speci men positively declines to take the broadest hints to be shaken off, and you are reduced to dodging round corners, inventing engagements, or hiding as if you had appropriated something which did not belong to you. It is all of no avail : the bore finds you out, and makes your deceit ignominiously palpable. In despair you give in and struggle no longer against your fate, submitting to the smiling company of your tormentor and thirsting for his blood.\" \" I have a place in my mind,\" said Dr. Froom meditatively, \" that would, I think, do admirably. It is neither small nor fashionable ; plenty of amusement and a variety of visitors : the name of it is Shinglebeach. There is a very good boarding-house at which I have stayed. Now, if you want to study human nature in D"], [42, "34 THE BELLS. a variety of branches, go to a boarding-house. The chances are, before you have been there long you will find some kindred spirits equally bent upon enjoying the study also. To begin with, the ' reduced gentlewoman ' (I need not say that is her own mode of describing her self) who keeps it is eminently entertaining ; her daugh ter, Miss Emily Blundell, is even more so. Do not be distressed if, when you go to interview Mrs. Blundell on the subject of rooms, she is moved to tears at the ignominy of her present position and the recollection of better days ; she always is ; it is part of the bargain. After she has fully explained to you that in poor dear Blundell's lifetime she moved in the ' hupper circles ' she will treat you like a prince, and make you excep tionally comfortable. The people you meet at Mrs. Blundell's are considerably mixed \u2014 old maids and old bachelors, gushing spinsters in search of husbands, people with more money than refinement, and people with more refinement than money ; a few like yourself, who are finding considerable amusement in observing and criticising their fellow-creatures.\" Vanlyn again produced his pencil. \" The address, if you please,\" he said; \" an oppor tunity of this sort ought not to be treated lightly. Do you consider the spinsters likely to prove dangerous ?\" \"I did not find them so.\" \" You do not think there is any fear of one of them taking possession of me by force and marrying me ?\" \" Not the slightest fear.\" \" That is satisfactory. Now for the address.\""], [43, "THE BELLS. 35 \" Mrs. Blundell, Tudor House, Shinglebeach.\" \" I will throw over all my engagements and go the day after to-morrow.'' \"I really wish you would,\" said the doctor. There was a pause. Then Vanlyn spoke again. Hitherto he had been talking lightly, treating the subject of his coming visit, the boarding-house and the inmates thereof, with amused and contemptuous conde scension. Suddenly he developed a more serious inter est in it than he had previously shown. \" I suppose these people get up picnics, boating and driving expeditions, and all that sort of thing,\" he said. \" What do they usually do in the evenings ?\" \" Go out after dinner and stroll about. Some go on the pier and listen to the band. At nine o'clock there is tea and coffee, afterwards music.\" The interest in Vanlyn's eyes deepened. \"Music again !\" he said; \"I suppose at Shingle beach you have music of one sort and another going on all day ?\" \" Yes, chiefly music-hall songs and waltzes.\" \"Things that ring in your head afterwards in spite of yourself.\" He was leaning eagerly forward, with his eyes on Dr. Froom's face ; he recovered himself the instant his companion looked at him. \" Yes, they sometimes have that effect.' \" Ah ! that is a disadvantage.\" Dr. Froom had noticed Mr. Vanlyn's change of manner, and felt a suspicion that he was leading up to some subject about which he did not care to ask a"], [44, "36 THE BELLS. direct question. To his surprise, when Vanlyn spoke again, Shinglebeach seemed to have passed completely from his mind. \" I went to see The Bells the other night,\" he said ; \" you have seen the piece, of course ?\" \" Yes ; it does not leave an agreeable impression behind,\" answered the doctor. \"The horrible is fully developed,\" said Vanlyn, \" and yet, I suppose, in your professional experience you have often come across cases of people continually imagining that they heard sounds or saw faces connected with their past lives. It is a trick of the imagination, even amounting to disease of the brain.\" \" I am glad to say I have come across very few such cases,\" said Dr. Froom ; \" such a state of things as you describe is very often simply the result of an over-taxed brain, or nerves unduly strained. Perfect mental rest and bodily exercise is the best treatment for cases of that kind, if they have not gone too far.\" \" One's imagination is very graphic,\" said Vanlyn, leaning eagerly forward ; \" these delusions appear ter ribly real to the person who imagines he sees or hears them.\" \" Have you ever come across such a case ?\" The whole expression of Vanlyn's face altered. He resumed his former attitude, and laughed as he an swered, \" No, never ; talking of The Bells put the idea into my head.\""], [45, "CHAPTER IV. A FISH OUT OF WATER According to her own statement the proprietress of Tudor House was a reduced gentlewoman. She rose to receive Mr. Vanlyn with an air of importance, which she considered befitted the adopted role. She was attired in black silk, which crackled and rustled in the most superior style ; a lace cap, the border of which blossomed with pink rosebuds ; in addition she wore a considerable amount of massive and inexpensive jewelry. \"Any friend of Dr. Froom's,\" she assured Mr. Vanlyn, \" was most welcome. She had the very thing in bedrooms to suit him on the drawing-room floor; she hoped he would consider himself one of the family, if she might say so. Years ago things had been different with her : she often thought, with tears iu her eyes, what her poor papa's feelings would have been to see her occupying her present position. But there, there! how she did run on, to be sure! Mr. Vanlyn would excuse her. There were only a few people in the house now : several who had been with her for some time had just gone away, several more were expected. Her terms were two pounds ten a week, which included everything. One rule she made and stuck to, that her visitors should be quite select \u2014 people with whom she and her dearest Emily might with propriety associate. No doubt Mr. Vanlyn would like to see his rooms now."], [46, "38 A FISH OUT OF WATER. Very well ; if he would follow, she would lead the way. The hour of breakfast was nine, luncheon from one till two, dinner at six, and coffee at nine.\" All this she contrived to say before Vanlyn could get a word in edgeways, and when she left him he gave a gasp of relief. \" Froom was right in one respect,\" he said, \" it is certainly a change.\" Having dispensed with the dust of travelling and changed his clothes, he found, on looking at his watch, that it was ten minutes to six, and accordingly repaired to the drawing-room. Mrs. Blundell was already there, sitting in state ; she considerately introduced Vanlyn to the other visitors. \"Mr. and Mrs. Gushington,\" she said, indicating a red-haired gentleman and a sandy-haired lady with a turn-up nose, who were engaged in squeezing each other's hands under the cover of a book of prints in which they pretended to be absorbed. \"Bride and bridegroom,\" said Mrs. Blundell, in an audible aside. \" Mr. Summerly, ahem ! Mr. Summerly, Mr. Vanlyn.\" The gentleman thus introduced looked up from his newspaper, frowned, bowed stiffly, and went on reading. \" The Miss Billings are not here at present. Charming girls, Mr. Vanlyn ; so full of fun and nonsense ; one of them paints like an R.A., and the other sings superbly. You must ask her to favour us this evening ; anything for the gentlemen, you know. The Reverend and Mrs. Tuvery complete our circle. A worthy man is Mr. Tuvery. It is always a pleasure to"], [47, "A FISH OUT OF WATER. 39 me to entertain the clergy : probably he and his good lady are already in the dining-room.\" The Rev. Josias and Mrs. Tuvery were already sitting at the table. The principal items about the lady which struck you at first sight were the extreme redness of her nose and the uncleanness of her collar. She wore on her head a bonnet, the strings of which were untied and thrown over her shoulders. Her husband confined himself to glaring angrily at the visitors, the servants, and the soup. If he had not been fed for a week, he could not have attacked his dinner with more energy. \" And this is my dearest child,\" said Mrs. Blundell, introducing a damsel of about forty summers: \"a mother's pride and a mother's hopes are all centred in her, Mr. Vanlyn.\" Emily smiled, simpered, looked at the new-comer, and retired to her seat and her duties at the bottom of the table. \" So shy,\" whispered Mrs. Blundell ; \" I wish she could be brought out more than she is. If things had been different, &c.\" Emily, in spite of her forty summers, could not be called a faded blossom ; she was more strictly speaking an artificial one. From the golden hair which adorned her head to the high-heeled slippers which deformed her feet, she was made up, and a very palpable and honest make up it was. She looked after the visitors admirably while her mother did the talking. Finding themselves deprived of the book of prints,"], [48, "40 A FISH OUT OF WATER. Mr. and Mrs. Gushington squeezed each other's hands under the table-cloth between the courses. Mr. Vanlyn, who was sitting opposite, wondered if this were the usual style of things, and felt rather ill. When dinner was half over, the Miss Billings appeared bursting with apologies. They both talked at once and said very nearly the same things, which was after all less confusing than if they had chosen different topics of conversation. It appeared they had been to an enchanting picnic, and had no idea how time went. They wished Mrs. Blundell and dear Emily had been there too ; in fact, they wished every one had been there. Mr. Tuvery here looked as if nothing short of the young ladies' total annihilation could appease him. \" It was quite too awfully jolly,\" they affirmed ; and Bell sketched the grosp sitting on the grass, and Floss sang to them coming home, and altogether it was a re'd-letter day in their calendar. Mr. Summerly ate his dinner almost in silence, and Mrs. Blundell informed Vanlyn that silence was a sign of genius, and that she had heard Mr. Summerly was an author and wrote wonderful books; whereupon he came to the conclusion that sooner or later this motley throng would have the questionable satisfaction of posing before the public. After dinner Vanlyn was reduced to running the risk of being put in a book himself and speaking to the author \u2014 there was literally no one else with whom he could talk. Mrs. Blundell's loquacity was oppressive, and, in his present state of nerves, intensely irritating."], [49, "41 A FISH OUT OF WATER. Upon Summerly he made a very favourable im pression ; he was accomplished in the art of impressing people favourably, and he exercised it whenever he chose. \" I am quite a stranger here,\" he said ; \" what can I do to dispose of an evening ?\" \" Come on the pier ; it is the usual thing to do, I believe.\" \" Are you going?\" \" Yes ; won't you join me ?\" \" I shall be delighted.\" They strolled along together, smoking and talking. To Vanlyn's disgust the Miss Billings joined them. He comforted himself with the reflection that in this terrible place there was no fear of meeting any one who knew him, and then he brought himself down to the feeble amusement of paying them the broadest compli ments he could invent. \" I suppose this is what Froom meant by a ' thorough change,' \" he thought disgustedly. \" It certainly ought to do me a great deal of good, on the principle that it is anything but pleasant.\" Mr. Summerly submitted to his fate with very good grace ; in fact, he seemed a good deal amused by it. When the Miss Billings returned to Tudor House they had something delightfully mysterious to relate. \" Where is Mr. Vanlyn ?\" they bosh exclaimed in a breath. \"He came in an hour ago,\" returned Emily Blundell."], [50, "42 A FISH OUT OF WATER. \" So nice, but so curious, my dear,\" said Bell. \"What do you think? He was talking to us on the pier quite pleasantly, and seemed to be enjoying himself and the music so much, when suddenly his face changed, he stopped talking, and appeared to be listening intently with his eyes fixed on the sea ; then he asked me if I could see a boat with two people in it. I looked, but could see nothing; he shaded his face with his hand, so that it was hidden from me. ' I suppose very few people could see a boat that distance,' he said ; ' I have very long sight.' After a minute or two he spoke irritably of the noise of the band, and abruptly left the pier. He was so odd altogether, we felt afraid he must be ill.\" \"He is reading in the drawing-room,\" returned Miss Blundell. \" I think he has come to Shingle beach for the benefit of his health.\" They found Mr. Vanlyn, as Emily had said, read ing; he looked rather pale, but seemed to be taking absorbing interest in his book. On going behind him, Bell observed the book was upside down. After making this discovery she ventured a remark. \" The evenings are so warm,\" she said insinuat ingly. \" Don't you prefer the balcony, Mr. Vanlyn?\" Laurence looked up. \" I think not. I have had enough of the sea for to-night,\" he said, and looked back again at his book. After tea Mr. and Mrs. Gushington sang a duet; the lady took the second, the gentleman the first. The effect was novel, and to some extent varied by"], [51, "43 THE NEW ARRIVAL. sundry mistakes in the accompaniment, caused by the extreme nervousness of the bride. Miss Billing in formed the company generally \" that they need not come wooing to her,\" as her heart, her heart was over the sea ; and Emily Blundell, in a somewhat rasping voice, \" chose to be a daisy.\" The evening at last came to an end, and Laurenco Vanlyn resolved that to-morrow would be his last day at Tudor House. Probably it would have been, if an event had not happened which changed all his plans \u2014 an event which was to shape the destiny of more lives than one. CHAPTER V. THE NEW ARRIVAL On returning home to lunch, Mr. Vanlyn made a discovery which awoke in his mind a certain amount of speculation. It was nothing more astonishing than a pair of lady's gloves carefully placed between the leaves of a volume of Tennyson's poems. The book was lying on the drawing-room table, as if it had been inadver tently left there by some one in a hurry. \" The Miss Billings do not read Tennyson, I feel sure, and Mrs. Gushington looks as if she read no thing.\" He half opened the book, and looked at the gloves. \" A new arrival,\" he said, observing they were much too small to fit any of the ladies he had seen at"], [52, "44 THE NEW ARRIVAL. Tudor House ; \" a new arrival, who reads Tennyson, and has small hands. I wonder what she is like, why she came here, and how long she will remain ?\" He took up the newspaper, began to read, and forgot the new arrival, until the door opened, and a girl's voice fell on his ear \u2014 a girl's voice, blithe and musical as a thrush's song. Involuntarily he raised his eyes from the newspaper, and looked at her. She came in like a flash from some gleaming northern star; so gay, so intoxicated with youth and happiness, beautiful in face and form as the goddess of beauty herself, and supremely unconscious of it> caring nothing for the charms which she possessed save that of youth and health, and a capacity for enjoy ing all her unalloyed happiness. Her hand rested lightly on the arm of an aristocratic-looking man, with iron-gray hair, between fifty and sixty years of age. This modern Aphrodite appeared to take no more notice of Mr. Vanlyn than if he had not existed. \" Remember your promise, papa,\" she said, con tinuing the conversation. \" In Rome we did as the Romans do : what is the use of coming to Shingle beach, if we do not follow the same rule ?\" The gentleman laughed amusedly. \" We must draw a line somewhere,\" he returned. \" Don't you think it would be as well to draw it at a comic concert on Shinglebeach Pier ?\" \" Not at all. From Mr. Summerly 's description, it is one of the attractions of the place ; we must not despise it.\""], [53, "THE NEW ARRIVAL. 45 \"Then I should suggest your keeping away from it. Think of the music we have been hearing lately, and then think of a comic song ! The two are terribly incongruous.\" \"Life is made up of incongruities,\" she persisted. \"I want to study life. The sublime and the ridiculous generally go hand in hand. Mr. Summerly made the programme appear most attractive and novel.\" \" Novel, decidedly,\" with a smile. The gong sounded for luncheon. Vanlyn laid the newspaper on the table. He felt this young lady's total indifference to his presence was not flattering. For years he had been sought after and admired by the opposite sex, never ignored and treated with indif ference. Even the Miss Billings, who were unable to appreciate properly a being from another world from their own, had gushed over his various attractions in a loud enough whisper to reach his ears ; and here was this girl, beautiful as a tropical bird, a being as utterly different from the Miss Billings as light from darkness \u2014 this girl, whom he thought would in an instant dis cover the contrast between himself and the others \u2014 had never condescended even to look at him. \" I will make her look at me,\" he mentally resolved ; and then he held the door open for her to pass out. As she came towards him he wondered greatly what could have induced her to take up her abode at Tudor House. This, however, her remarks to her father partly explained : she wanted to see life in all its phases."], [54, "46 THE NEW ARRIVAL. Her dress almost touched Vanlyn as she passed ; a faint colour came into her face, the long fringed eye lids trembled, that was all. With a slight inclination of her head, she passed him without once raising her eyes to his face. Her father, on the other hand, got into conversa tion with him immediately ; thanked him for his politeness, and remarked upon the weather. Vanlyn's place at the table was exactly opposite that of Miss Bannerleigh and her father (in the absence of Mrs. Blundell, Emily mentioned the name of the new arrivals). Then Mr. Summerly dropped in, and sat next Aphrodite. Vanlyn could only succeed in hearing scraps of their conversation, by reason of Miss Billing's unceasing remarks poured ad nauseam into his unwilling ears. The idea that the girl opposite should mentally class him with his loquacious neighbour irritated him beyond measure. Every moment he sat there he felt more and more out of place ; he thought Mr. Sum merly, who knew him to be, from his manner and conversation last night, of a different mould from his surroundings, might have had the civility to speak to him \u2014 to have made some commonplace remark, or included him casually in the conversation ; but appa rently Mr. Summerly had forgotten his existence. Vanlyn determined that under no circumstances would he remain another day in that obnoxious place, and be persecuted by those dreadful girls. As soon as he had finished his luncheon he left the"], [55, "47 THE NEW ARRIVAL. table and went out. He felt a great desire to kick Dr. Froom, and afterwards compel him to sit beside Miss Billing during every meal for a week. Then he lighted a cigar, strolled on to the beach, threw himself down under the shade of a boat some distance from every one else, and tried to read. \" What a fish out of water I feel !\" he soliloquised dismally; \"this kind of thing is as utterly out of my line as an expedition to the North Pole would be ; and yet last night I slept better than I have done for some time. If my nerves would only get stronger, I could put up with almost anything. I wonder what Aphrodite is doing this afternoon?\" \" Take your likeness, sir ?\" said a voice behind him ; \" beautiful portrait, sir, in any position, frame complete, one shilling.\" The owner of the voice here appeared on Mr. Vanlyn's side of the boat, a man of unprepossessing appearance, laden with a collection of revolting like nesses of revolting people. \" Certainly not,\" returned Vanlyn angrily. The photographer left him. He closed his book and looked dreamily at the splashing surging sea. Grand in its unconquerable might, awe-inspiring as a god ; despotic, imperious, yet pathetic and gentle. A sea, the music of whose waves is as a lullaby, and the sobbing thereof as a soul in pain; a sea which appeals to the mood of man, whatever that mood may be. To one it is a divine inspiration, to another it"], [56, "48 THE NEW ARRIVAL. brings the torture of remembrance ; to all it is some thing living, speaking, appealing. The tiny pebbles hurry along after each other, pushed away, it seems, by repelling hands, till, their banishment ended, they shall be carried back on the white arms of crested waves to the bosom of their mother, the sea. In the distance there is a little boat with a sail, white, gleaming in the rays of the sun ; it glides onward, coming in with the tide and riding along gaily. \"Beautiful William pears, only twopence each;\" a basket containing them was thrust under Vanlyn's nose. \" Take them away,\" he said, more angrily than before, and pulling his hat over his eyes. \"Boat, sir?\" \" Confound it, no !\" with great energy. Ten minutes later : \" Nice fresh buns, sir?\" Vanlyn rose and glared at his tormentor, \" Do you want to drive a man mad ?\" he inquired. \" If you were a public nuisance, especially established to empty the place of every able-bodied human creature, you could not devise a better plan for doing it. Do I look like a man who could eat indigestible buns, in a broiling hot sun at three o'clock in the afternoon ?\" Suddenly the absurdity of the situation struck him, and he laughed. \"Take them away,\" he said; \"for pity's sake, take them away.\" A low musical laugh and the splash of oars fell on his ear. He looked round quickly."], [57, "THE NEW ARRIVAL. A boat was gliding along gently quite close to the shore. At one end sat Mr. Bannerleigh, and at the other the girl who had never once condescended to look at Laurence Vanlyn. Her white dress was dazzling in the bright sun light ; she was leaning slightly over the side of the boat, letting the waves ripple over one of her small white hands ; in the other she held a black Japanese sunshade. In the centre sat a boatman rowing leisurely. It was a pretty picture, prettier than any Laurence Vanlyn had seen since he came to Shinglebeach. He more than half suspected that low musical laugh had been at his expense ; and yet, long after the boat was out of sight, aud he could see the dazzling white dress no more, the recollection of it made him smile. \" What a ridiculous spectacle I must have pre- sented !\" he reflected ; \" a persecuted tourist goaded to the verge of distraction by the vendor of indigestible buns ! I will go to the reading-room, glance at the papers, and look out my trains. Froom has developed a talent of which I imagined him utterly devoid \u2014 practical joking.\" At the reading-room he found Mr. Summerly. Vanlyn was suddenly possessed with the desire to in- crease the favourable impression he had made upon him last night. Although he had determined to leave Shinglebeach to-morrow, there remained to-night to be got through, and another evening on the pier in company with the Miss Billings was not to be thought of. The chances were Mr. Summerly would go off some where with his friends, and leave him out in the cold. E"], [58, "50 THE NEW ARRIVAL. Before they had been talking half an hour, they discovered they possessed a mutual friend in no less a person than Dr. Froom. \" I think I saw your friends on the water,\" said Vanlyn at length, changing the subject. \" Are they making a long stay at Shinglebeach ?\" \" They don't know,\" he answered ; \" they are creatures of impulse, going about just where the fancy takes them, and having no home-ties. I met them a year ago in Switzerland, and we became excellent friends : it was a pleasant surprise to tumble across them again here.\" \" Miss Bannerleigh is extraordinarily beautiful,\" said Vanlyn, glancing at his companion. \" Yes, she is not an ordinary girl in any respect ; so bright and full of fun, seeing the absurd side of every thing more quickly than almost any one I ever met. Her father idolises her, and indulges her every whim ; and yet such treatment has not in the very least spoiled her, for the simple reason that her character is too strong to be spoiled by anything. She is inexpressibly happy, without the slightest idea of what trouble is. There is something infinitely sad to me in contemplating such a being, because one knows that soon, very soon, the end must come ; that the fairest and brightest of God's creatures must ere long wake up to the know ledge of suffering, the one thing in this world which is absolutely limitless.\" He spoke absently, more to himself than his com panion. Again Vanlyn changed the subject. \" I am leaving"], [59, "51 SHE SHALL SPEAK TO ME TO-NIGHT. here to-morrow,\" he said. \" I find the experiment has not been a success : the last two days have been inexpressibly dreary.\" \" I am sorry for that,\" said Mr. Summerly ; \" I was hoping we might be able to get up a few pleasant boating expeditions and a picnic or two ; the Bannerleighs are capital people for that kind of thing. Give my kindest regards to Froom, when you see him. Good-bye for the present.\" Second thoughts are proverbially the best ; whether they are practically so is another question. Laurence Vanlyn entered the reading-room with the determina tion to quit Shinglebeach on the following day; he left it with a determination to do nothing of the kind. Which resolve was the better, remained to be proved. Only one thing would prove it \u2014 time. CHAPTER VI. \" SHE SHALL SPEAK TO ME TO-NIGHT \" \" Mr. Vanlyn and I have already discovered we have a possession in common, that most pleasant of all possessions, a friend.\" These were the words which fell on Vanlyn's ear as he came into the drawing-room, where already most of the inmates of Tudor House were assembled, awaiting dinner."], [60, "52 SHE SHALL SPEAK TO ME TO-NIGHT. In a moment his eyes caught the group in the window. Summerly was standing with his back to the window, talking to Mr. Bannerleigh. Miss Bannerleigh was leaning against it, looking absently at the splashing surging sea ; obviously the subject of Laurence Vanlyn had not the slightest interest for her. It was such an unusual experience to be ignored, that Miss Bannerleigh's perfect indifference to him interested him more in her than anything else could possibly have done. He wondered when those deep fringed lashes were raised whether the dark eyes beneath would be full of interest, or curiosity, or the old polite calm indifference. Involuntarily he drew nearer, and felt a certain amount of contempt for himself for doing so. Mr. Summerly turned to him. \"We were just speaking of you,\" he said. \"I am quite disappointed you are leaving Shinglebeach to morrow. Mr. Bannerleigh has been proposing an ex pedition to the light-ship, if we can make up a party.\" \" I have not finally made up my mind to go,\" re turned Vanlyn, with a glance at the fair beautiful face with the absent look on it. \" You will go with us, of course, Miss Bannerleigh ?\" continued Summerly, smiling. Not a muscle of her face altered ; she never looked round, her eyes were still fixed upon the sea. \" That would depend upon circumstances,\" she an swered demurely. \" What are you going to do, when you get there ?\""], [61, "53 SHE SHALL SPEAK TO ME TO-NIGnT. \" Have luncheon and come home again. \" It sounds exciting. Luncheon, I suppose, con sisting of nice fresh buns and splendid William pears at twopence each,\" she said, the faintest dawning of a smile coming into her eyes in spite of herself. \" As an addition to the entertainment you might engage a photographer, the one who promises to take ' a 'andsome portrait, in any position, frame included, for a shilling.' \" She turned her head slowly. For a second the long lashes were raised, and a pair of mischievous brown eyes met Laurence Vanlyn's ; the next instant she was looking at Mr. Summerly. \" I don't like buns,\" she said. \" I saw an extra ordinary child this afternoon \u2014 it ate three, and during the whole time searched persistently for the currants. Watching the child reminded me painfully of watching the monkeys at the Zoo. The currants were few and far between, as they used to be in our puddings at school ; the girls declared they could hear them calling to each other, ' Brother, where art thou ?' \" Mr. Summerly laughed. \"You shall not be fed on buns,\" he said; \"I will promise that.\" \" Then I will go to the light-ship.\" The gong sounded for dinner, and one by one the people filed out. Laurence Vanlyn was the last to leave the room. \" She laughed at me this afternoon,\" he thought, \" she looked at me this evening ; she shall speak to me to-night.\" And with this resolution he followed her."], [62, "54 SHE SHALL SPEAK TO ME TO-NIGHT. During dinner she talked merrily to her father and Mr. Summerly ; only once she looked across the table at Vanlyn. It was when Mr. Gushington tenderly inquired if his \" wee birdie \" felt tired. Then Aphrodite's eyes met his once more, and she smiled. She could not have helped it to save her life, she was so keenly alive to the ridiculous, and she felt instinctively that he was too. Mr. Bannerleigh was a particularly easy man to get on with under most circumstances. He had travelled about so much, and had met in his time such a variety of men of many nations. He had taken a fancy to Vanlyn from the first; he saw at a glance how impossible it was for him to fraternise with the people at Tudor House; consequently he felt a certain kind of compassion for his isolated condition, and a desire to show him any civility in his power. Mr. Summerly had spoken favourably of his new acquaintance, and under these circumstances Mr. Bannerleigh stretched out the right hand of fellowship to him. \" I understand you are leaving Shinglebeach in dis gust at the dreariness of it,\" he said. \" We are going on the pier to-night ; if you have nothing better to do, perhaps you may care to join us.\" \" Thank you,\" returned Vanlyn, \" I shall be very glad.\" Miss Bannerleigh's gay mood had disappeared. All the way to the pier she talked in the most serious, orthodox style possible."], [63, "SHE SHALL SPEAK TO ME TO-NIGHT. 55 Vanlyn was exerting himself with most unusual eagerness to make a favourable impression upon Aphro dite's father, and succeeding admirably. \" Tell me what you have been doing since we said good-bye on that sunny morning in Switzerland,\" said Summerly, falling a little behind the others, and ad dressing Enid Bannerleigh. \"Give you a sketch of a year of my life?\" she questioned, with a smile. \"What a terribly difficult task you have set me! I will sum it up in a few words. I have been intensely happy; I have seen more picture galleries than I can count ; I have half the Old Masters at my finger-ends, and a perplexing jumble of Madon nas and Holy Families, saints and sinners, in my head; I have wandered about some magnificent cathedrals, and been to more than one service at St. Peter's ; and I have gone into the tiniest village churches, and seen the peasants drop in one by one, with their baskets of fresh fruit and vegetables and flowers, to say a prayer and depart again, the rays of the setting sun meeting and dazzling them as they went. I have seen a storm in the Swiss mountains, and I have heard music, such divine music as I could not have believed it possible the soul of any earthly being could conceive \u2014 and now we are going to listen to comic songs.\" She stopped abruptly and looked at her companion. \" Why did we get on the subject of Switzerland and Italy ? I wish we had not,\" she said. \" I was in the mood for comic songs when we came out, and now I am afraid they will jar.\""], [64, "56 SHE SHALL SPEAK TO ME TO-NIGHT. \" Then let us give them up,\" said Mr. Summerly, \" we shall not lose much. Tell me in what other ways you have managed to be so intensely happy during the last year.\" \" I have told you everything ; let us give the comic songs a trial, at least,\" looking after her father and his companion. \" You have left out one very interesting and im portant piece of information,\" he said, looking down at her; \"Mr. Bannerleigh let me into the secret this morning.\" The bright colour came into her face. \" It was very wrong of papa,\" she said ; \" I did not want you to know.\" \" That was a little unkind, when you know that if it were possible to increase the interest which I have presumed to feel in you, the knowledge of your being an author would certainly do so.\" \"I am not an author,\" she said; \"writing one faulty little novel does not justify one in adopting the title.\" \" Will you let me read your book ?\" \" On one condition.\" \"I will submit to any condition; what is it?\" \" That you will criticise it fairly and tell me all the faults. Do you know that ever since I was quite a small child, writing has been a perfect passion with me. I have read and studied, and made papa take me about everywhere, that I might acquire a better knowledge of men and things; and now I find that my work is full of"], [65, "SHE SHALL SPEAK TO ME TO-NIGHT. 57 glaring faults, and many times I should have given it up in despair, but it would not let me. The fire burned so fiercely, nothing could extinguish it. I persuaded papa to bring me here that I might learn more of my fellow-creatures. They are very diverting,\" suddenly smiling ; \" those terrible Miss Billings, for instance. How they persecuted your unhappy friend to-day at luncheon ! I could not help being intensely amused.\" \" So you are studying character,\" said Mr. Sum merly. \" When may I see your book ?\" \" To-morrow, if you care to do so.\" \" You know I care.\" They had reached the pier, and found Mr. Banner leigh and Vanlyn waiting for them. They stood all together listening to the music for a few minutes, then Vanlyn spoke to Enid. \" I saw you this afternoon,\" he said; \" are you fond of the sea ?\" She turned and looked at him. \" Yes,\" she an swered, \"I am very fond of it; it is one of the few things of which I never tire.\" \" I should not have imagined you tired easily of anything.\" \" I do. I am tired already of this absurd man and his songs ; let us leave him and listen to the sea instead.\" As she spoke she turned away, and, leaning her hand on the railing of the pier, looked down at the water beneath. Her father and Mr. Summerly had just hit upon a topic of absorbing interest, and were discussing"], [66, "58 SHE SHALL SPEAK TO ME TO-NIGHT. it with vigour. When Enid raised her eyes she saw Laurence Vanlyn was standing beside her. \" Do you prefer the sea to the songs ?\" she asked. \" Very much.\" \"I wanted to come here this afternoon,\" she said; \" it is all Mr. Summerly's fault. I am disgusted with it now ; to-morrow my mood will probably have changed again, and I shall enjoy it. What is that light over there ? it keeps disappearing every few seconds.\" \"It is the revolving light on the light-ship,\" he answered, looking at the big brown eyes that had grown strangely earnest and grave. \" The place where we are going to have a picnic ?\" \"Yes.\" \" Have you been there ?\" \" No.\" \" Under those circumstances it is rather a pity you will not be able to stay and go with us.\" \"I should like to go.\" \"Then why not do so?\" The question was asked with but very little in terest ; her tone conveyed the unflattering conviction that she was not listening for his reply. He did not make one, but asked a question in stead : \" Why did you laugh at me this afternoon ?\" \" I was so sorry for you,\" with an amused smile. \"May I ask if that is your usual way of showing sorrow ?\" \" No, not quite ; but it was such a remarkably"], [67, "59 SHE SHALL SPEAK TO ME TO-NIGHT. absurd situation. The idea of your eating buns and being photographed on the beach struck me as being two of the things which as long as you lived you would never dream of doing.\" \" I did not flatter myself you were even conscious of my existence.\" \" There is nothing flattering or singular in my observing you,\" she said quickly, and looking away from him, \" for the simple reason that I observe every one.\" \" Shall I stay and go to the light-ship, or shall I not ?\" he said, addressing no one, and only apparently speaking his thoughts aloud ; \" Fate shall decide.\" \" Fate ?\" said Enid questioningly. \" Look,\" he said ; \" if the next wave touches that big white stone just below us, I go ; if not, I stay.\" She leaned over the pier, and her eyes followed the direction of his hand. \"Is it not rather an uncanny way of deciding one's fate ?\" she said, with a shudder. \" Would you not choose some other way ?\" \" It is too late,\" he replied. \" Look !\" Already the wave had broken and crept up, slowly, it seemed to the two people watching it, till it was within a few inches of the stone ; then it stopped. \"Fate is for once kind,\" said Laurence Vanlyn, taking a slip of paper from his pocket; \"this is the list of my trains. Now, look once more !\" He tore it into shreds, and threw the pieces into the sea. Perhaps the waves carried them, with their other prey, to the mermaids' coral cave."], [68, "CHAPTER VII. \" IT WAS A PERFECT DAY \" Another day had gone \u2014 a day of luxurious idle ness ; half of it had been spent by the Bannerleighs and Laurence Vanlyn in sailing. That morning struck him as being the shortest and pleasantest he had ever spent. Not that he suspected he was in the least likely to lose his heart or his peace of mind in the society of this Aphrodite \u2014 he considered himself too old a soldier in the campaign of flirtation to do that ; but she was a new experience to him, bright, clever, amusing, the being beyond all others most likely to divert and enter tain him, and make him forget himself. He had made yet another vow that morning : \"I will make her like me ;\" and ever since he had done his best to keep it. He had seen nothing of Enid during the afternoon, and had in consequence been obliged to console him self by playing billiards. Mr. Summerly had been invisible all day. Quite early in the morning he had taken Enid's MS., and disappeared with it, no one knew where. At luncheon-time he was still absent ; at ten minutes to six he reappeared. \" Where have you been ?\" asked Enid. \" We were beginning to imagine all kinds of terrible things had happened to you.\" \"I have been very pleasantly occupied,\" he an swered, with a smile. \" I provided myself against the probable contingency of missing my luncheon.\""], [69, "IT WAS A PERFECT DAY. 61 She could-not keep the excitement out of her eyes. \" You guess what I have been doing,\" he said. \" Yes ; what is the verdict ?\" \" I will tell you after dinner.\" \" I cannot eat a mouthful if you do not tell me now. You know what Juliet says : ' Is thy news good or bad ? Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance : Let me be satisfied \u2014 is't good or bad ?' \" \" In the main, good,\" he answered ; \" be satisfied with that until after dinner.\" She turned abruptly away, he thought ; when she looked back at him there were traces of tears in her eyes. \"I did not dare to expect that,\" she said; \" the hope of success is so much to me.\" On going to the drawing-room after dinner, Mr. Summerly found her on the balcony alone. Over the sea the sun was setting, making a path of golden light across the waters ; it was all very peaceful and quiet. A basket-chair stood there ; he pointed to it, taking another himself at a little distance from her. \" Now,\" said Enid, \"tell me the plain unvarnished truth ; it is the very kindest thing you can do. I would much rather hear it from you than any one else.\" \"I will tell you the truth,\" he answered. \" You have great talent; your descriptions of scenery are graphic, your plot carefully worked out, and your lan guage good. There is only one fault in your writing, and I tell you, if you were wise you would relinquish"], [70, "62 IT WAS A PERFECT DAY. your ambition rather than acquire the experience which will fill in the gap and complete the chain ; but you are a woman, and consequently you are not wise.\" She did not resent the uncomplimentary speech ; perhaps because she knew what his words implied, per haps because her art was so much to her that she would resent nothing which might help her to excel in it. \" My character-drawing has failed,\" she said, leaning eagerly forward ; \" I know that is the weak point.\" \" Yes,\" he answered, \" you made impossible people when you tried to describe what you have never felt.\" \" Shall I ever be a novelist ?\" \"Yes, when you have loved and \u2014 suffered.\" She buried her face in her hands and was silent. The wind played gently with her bright golden hair and the folds of her dress. Ten minutes passed, and still Mr. Summerly watched her. Suddenly she rose, like one who had made a re solve. There was a deep burning fire in her eyes he had never seen there before ; there was something defiant in her grand young beauty when with her own lips she chose her destiny. \"Let the suffering come,\" she said, in a low dis tinct voice, \"if it be the herald of fame ; others suffer, why should not I? I would rather endure than fail. You were right, I am not wise ; but then, as you say, I am a woman.\" \" Don't,\" he cried, as if he would ward off a blow ; \" I cannot bear to hear you talk like that. You do not know what you are saying.\""], [71, "IT WAS A PERFECT DAY. 63 \"Yes, I do,\" she returned. \" Tell me more minutely in what respect my characters are deficient.\" \"In pathos and passion,\" he answered, \"in suffer ing, wild rebellion, and the voiceless agony of a hopeless despair. These you have not described, because you have never felt them.\" Again she buried her face in her hands and was silent. The church clock struck nine. A solitary fisherman strolled past, the noise of his heavy boots made a clanking on the pavement. The sound recalled Enid from her reverie. \" Papa and Mr. Vanlyn will be back again soon,\" she said 6oftly. And then looking up to see why he did not answer, she found she was alone ; he had quietly disappeared into the stillness of the summer night. He was strolling along towards the pier absorbed in his own thoughts, paying no heed to the few passers-by. \"Very soon she will have learned the secret and be famous,\" he said to himself; \"in a few years, even months or weeks perhaps, the missing pearl in the string will be supplied and the work completed. The day of her awakening may have already dawned.\" He raised his eyes, and they rested on Laurence Vanlyn and Mr. Bannerleigh coming slowly towards him. \"Not yet, not yet,\" he said half aloud; \"let her be thought less and happy a little longer, beautiful, merry, heart whole little Enid.\" It is a self-evident fact that all things, pleasant and unpleasant, come to an end. A delightful fortnight had"], [72, "64 IT WAS A PERFECT DAY. exemplified this truism, in which a series of boating expeditions, including the visit to the light-ship, had taken place, and still the four principal actors in the little Shinglebeach drama remained upon the stage. Dr. Froom received a most satisfactory letter from his patient, wherein he reported his complete restoration to health ; his appetite had improved, his rest was un broken, his nerves were stronger, he had made some delightful friends, among them Mr. Summerly, a gen tleman well known to Dr. Froom himself. And now another day had dawned \u2014 fresh, bright, golden. The sun was shining on the crested waves ; already the beach was alive with excursionists, who had left the busy metropolis at five in the morning and expected to return to it about three the next, having had a day's pleasure (?). On these festive occasions the inhabitants and temporary residents took the oppor tunity of making an expedition into the country, and left the excursionists in undisputed possession of the beach, the boats, and the donkeys. Mrs. Blundell had for once provided a luncheon for four persons without the slightest reference to pounds, shillings, or pence. \"It was light but refined,\" she affirmed, \"and one of which her dear papa would have approved.\" It was Enid Bannerleigh's twenty-first birthday, and she had chosen her own way of spending it. \" Daddy, I want a picnic,\" she had said a few even ings before, using the old baby name she had never wholly relinquished. \" That useful and aristocratic"], [73, "IT WAS A PERFECT DAY. 65 Blundell can provide the eatables and drinkables ; I have not the remotest idea what to order. We will have a carriage with horses that can go, and resign ourselves to rural felicity for a long day.\" \" You and I, Enid ?\" \" Certainly.\" \" Who else ?\" \" Mr. Summerly.\" \"Any one else?\" They were alone in the drawing-room, the others having gone out before coffee and music. Enid was sitting on a low stool at her father's feet, with one arm resting on his knee. She turned away her head. \" I thought it would be nice to ask Mr. Vanlyn to join us,\" she said, in a low voice. Mr. Bannerleigh took her head between his hands, and turned her face towards him. \" Do you like Mr. Vanlyn, Enid ?\" \"Yes, papa.\" He stooped down and kissed her. \"My darling,\" he said unsteadily, \"I must make up my mind to the fact that you are a woman now. I would rather have kept you a child a little longer. I suppose some one will be wanting to take you away from me before long. God only knows how desolate I shall be without you.\" \" I am not going,\" she cried, folding her arms about his neck; \" no one will ever want me as much as you do, Daddy. I am not at all an attractive sort of person. F"], [74, "66 IT WAS A PERFECT DAY. People,\" hesitating slightly, \"would grow tired of me very soon ; there is a sort of restlessness about me that is fatiguing.\" \"Your birthday must be a very happy one, my darling,\" he said; \" I should like you in years to come to look back upon it and say, ' I had everything I wanted \u2014 it was a perfect day !' \" \" It will be a perfect day,\" she returned. The place finally fixed upon for the picnic was on the site of an old castle, part of the ruins of which still remained. \" We will take no servant,\" Enid said ; \" it will be much more fun doing everything for ourselves. What a glorious muddle we shall get into !\" The Jehu who drove their chariot to the ruins had orders to return at five o'clock, so as to land them at Tudor House in time for dinner, and in the mean time they were to enjoy themselves in the best way they could devise. \"This is exactly the sort of thing I enjoy,\" said Mr. Summerly, getting into a hopeless muddle with the table-cloth, and believing he was making himself extraordinarily useful. Vanlyn was kneeling on the grass, diving into the hamper, and Mr. Bannerleigh devoting his attention to a champagne cork, which exhibited, as soon as the wire was cut, an undue inclination to pop; while Enid flitted about among the three, making the air musical with her laughter, and looking far less the woman she was than the child she felt."], [75, "67 IT WAS A PERFECT DAY. They had a very pleasant luncheon that balmy summer's day among the old ruins ; they seemed to have left the sea a long way off, and gone for a little time into another world. The golden corn was waving down in the valley at their feet, bending to and fro as the soft wind sighed through it. They could see the gaudy poppies, and cornflowers, and big moon daisies, with hosts of other delicate blossoms which the hand of Nature bad alone cultivated. Cattle lying under the shade of the trees in a sleepy reverie, with eyes half closed, chewing the cud in peaceful satisfaction. Over the hills the faint tinkle of the sheep-bells came to them mixed with the bleating of the sheep. \" I hope ruralising does not bore you,\" said Enid, turning to Mr. Vanlyn. He looked back at her in all her dazzling beauty, at the smile of perfect happiness on her face, at the big brown eyes that fell before his, and then looked dreamily away beyond him, resting on the distant bills. \"May every hope you have be realised as com pletely as that one !\" he answered, in a low voice. \" Mrs. Gusbington told me to-day she bated picnics,\" said Enid; \"she always expected to find creeping things innumerable in the eatables and wasps in the drinkables, and she infinitely preferred sitting on a chair to the grass.\" \"Did she?\" returned, Laurence Vanlyn, smiling ; \" perhaps, if you bad invited her to join us, her views on the subject might have undergone a slight change.\""], [76, "68 IT WAS A PERFECT DAY. He glanced at their two companions lying on the grass, smoking, and leisurely discussing some topic of mutual interest, and then at Enid again. \" Do you care to explore the ruin ?\" he asked. \"I suppose it is the proper thing to do.\" \" There is a virtuous satisfaction about having done the proper thing on these occasions,\" she returned brightly. \" Then let us do it.\" They wandered along side by side, this girl, innocent and happy, who had never learned either to love or suffer ; and this man, who had made love to more women than he could count or cared to remember, who bad grown sceptical about most things in heaven and earth, whose principal idea was to kill time quickly, and get as much excitement out of life as he conveniently could. He was weary of almost everything, but he had learned to conceal his weariness, as he concealed everything else under whatever mask he chose to put on. And yet he bad spoken truly when be said he was not bored. He was experiencing a feeling of quiet, restful enjoyment, which was wholly new to him. These surroundings were a complete change from the crowded rooms and stifling atmosphere where his life was for the most part spent, and bis companion was a complete contrast to most of the ladies of his acquaintance. \"It seems to me,\" said Enid, suddenly turning to him, \" that a certain class of the British public have but two ideas : one is, eating on all possible occasions ; and the other, engraving their detestable^autographs on"], [77, "IT WAS A PERFECT DAY. 69 every object of public interest. Look here, this block of gray stone is positively covered with them \u2014 John Smith, James Brown, and Tom something else \u2014 I cannot quite see what.\" He stooped down, and laid his fingers lightly on the little ungloved hand resting on the stone. \"It is their idea of enjoyment,\" he said, smiling; \"a sort of testimony to their having had a ' good time,' as the Americans say.\" \"Ah, well! one ought not to grudge them the poor satisfaction, I suppose ; but an old ruin seems to me in a way sacred. I fancy sometimes in the pale moon light, when everything around is intensely still, the spirits of those who inhabited it return and wander about the scene of their past triumphs and vanished glory. I can imagine beautiful women, who lived hundreds of years ago, walking down those broken stairs, standing perhaps at that turret-window watching for some one who never came, or as poor Elaine watched Sir Lancelot ride away, exercising that first and fatal discourtesy, apparent forgetfulness.\" \" I am afraid Sir Lancelot and Elaine were very mythical personages,\" said Vanlyn. \"Don't,\" cried Enid; \"I will not have my belief shaken in the smallest detail. They are quite real to me \u2014 as real as Queen Elizabeth and Henry VIII. , and much more interesting. Do not try to exceed the desecration of the Toms and Johns, and bring one face to face with unpleasant and common realities.\" \" I won't,\" he returned ; \" I promise to believe in"], [78, "70 IT WAS A PERFECT DAY. everything except the possibility of being happier than I am to-day.\" \"What a perfect day it has been!\" said Enid reflectively. \" I wonder if people have many such days in their lives ? Have you had many perfect days, Mr. Vanlyn ?\" \" No,\" he answered ; \" this is the only one I can remember. When you are as old as I am you will have forgotten most of the happiness of your life.\" \" Shall I ?\" she said, turning away her bead ; \" shall I forget to-day ?\" \" Sooner than I shall.\" A faint colour came into her face. \" There are some things which it is easier to remember than forget,\" she said. She ran up the broken steps, and stood there looking down upon him. He thought the picture she made, surrounded by the crumbling gray walls of ancient days, about which the ivy still twined its clinging arms, was an even prettier one than when she sat in the boat, with the rays of flashing summer sunlight playing on her white dress and golden hair. \" Shall we do a kind action before we go ?\" she asked. \"To whom?\" \"The farmers. Let us relieve them of some of those poppies ; I am so fond of wild flowers.\" \" Do you know, when I first saw you I christened you Aphrodite,\" said Vanlyn, smiling. \" I begin to see it was an appropriate name for more reasons than one.\""], [79, "71 IT WAS A PERFECT DAY. \" Because I like poppies ?\" she asked. \" Yes, and because you remind me a little of the sea foam. It always struck me as a pretty idea of the ancients that their beautiful goddess sprang from anything so pure and white and gentle.\" They strolled along towards the cornfields, down into the heart of the valley, talking in low tones of trivial things, that to Enid seemed suddenly to have become beautiful and interesting. Vanlyn gathered her a handful of bright red poppies, and she tucked them into her belt. \" I shall always like poppies now,\" she said, \" they will remind me of to-day.\" When they had reascended half the steep slope she stopped, and looked down to the place where a few moments ago they had been standing. \" Supposing I were to turn dizzy now,\" she said, with a shudder, \" what would happen ?\" \" Shall I tell you?\" he returned, looking into the brown eyes and childish lovely face, and then for a moment be put bis arm round her and held her close to him. \" That is what would happen,\" he said : \" you do not think I should let any harm come to you, do you ?\" She did not look at him or answer ; only a flood of intense, mad happiness filled her soul as she crossed at last the great border-land and her feet rested on the threshold of another life, more beautiful, more holy and divine than any she had imagined. They walked back to the ruins almost in silence,"], [80, "72 IT WAS A PERFECT DAY. and found Summerly and Mr. Bannerleigh awaiting them. \" Have you finished exploring ?\" asked Enid's father. ' ' I hope you have followed the example of the general public, and left your mark somewhere,\" said Summerly, with a light laugh. \"Look, I have made rather an unusual discovery !\" He pointed to a piece of stone with a few characters traced on it. Enid looked at it with interest. \" It looks like a violin,\" she said; \" and there is something written beneath. G \u2014 i \u2014 What is the next letter, Mr. Vanlyn ?\" \" T, I think,\" he answered. \" Tana,\" finished Enid. \" Gitana ! what a pretty Italian name !\" \" Very pretty,\" returned Vanlyn, turning to Mr. Summerly. \" How long do you suppose that has been done ? You are something of an antiquary, I believe. Five, ten, fifteen years\u2014 how long ?\" Mr. Summerly looked critically at it, then at the other names, with dates beside them. \" Not so long as that,\" he said ; \" it is compara tively fresh beside the others.\" \"How long?\" asked Vanlyn. \"Notmore than a few weeks, I should say, Laurence Vanlyn turned abruptly away, making some remark about hearing the carriage. Mr. Sum merly looked after him. \" What an inseparable quartette we have become in a fortnight !\" he said, turning to Enid. \" Can you"], [81, "I HAVE NOTHING TO FORGIVE. 73 believe that fourteen days ago you did not know such a person as Vanlyn existed ?\" \" No,\" returned Enid softly ; \"I don't think days or weeks have much to do with knowing people.\" \" Or liking them ?\" \" Or liking them,\" she repeated, looking dreamily at the golden cornfields. CHAPTER VIII. \" I HAVE NOTHING TO FORGIVE \" Shmglebeaeh. \"My dear Frootm, \u2014 As you will see by the above, I have once more returned to old England. I daresay you will be surprised to bear from me, but an event has occurred in which I feel sure you will be interested, and, therefore, I send you the details of it at first hand. \" A month ago I came to Shinglebeach, and took up my abode at Tudor House. I met there a Mr. Vanlyn, and, after a short conversation, had the favour able impression he had made upon me confirmed by discovering him to be a friend of yours. The day after Mr. Vanlyn's arrival some friends of mine, a Mr. and Miss Bannerleigh, also arrived at Tudor House. We four became excellent friends, and saw a great deal of each other. Yesterday Miss Bannerleigh expressed a wish to go on the water, and Vanlyn did the most natural thing in the world under the circumstances \u2014 he petitioned to go with her. They set out in a small"], [82, "74 I HAVE NOTHING TO FORGIVE. boat, Mr. Bannerleigh and I sitting on the beach and watching them. Vanlyn pulls an excellent stroke, like a man thoroughly at home at the work. They were a long distance from shore, when imagine our horror to see Miss Bannerleigh lean suddenly over the side of the boat to catch something floating past her. In a second the boat over-balanced. I hope as long as I live I shall never see such a look of agony on mortal face as I saw on Mr. Bannerleigh's. ' Enid cannot swim a yard,' he said. ' For God's sake, get a boat !' We scrambled into one, but the tide was coming rapidly in, and we both knew if Vanlyn could not swim, the chance of saving them was utterly hopeless. We pulled like the desperate men we were. When we got near, a cry of relief broke from Mr. Bannerleigh's lips. 'She is saved!' he cried; 'Vanlyn is swimming to wards us magnificently !' Yes, Froom, your friend has saved my friend's life. Miss Bannerleigh behaved like au angel ; she did exactly as she was told, kept her arms down, shut her eyes, and gave herself up to Laurence Vanlyn. We had them in the boat in a minute, very much exhausted, but, with that exception, none the worse for the adventure. If Vanlyn should suggest to Mr. Bannerleigh that he would like to be his son-in law, which I think highly probable, the chances are, after yesterday's adventure, he will say ' Yes.' I am leav ing here to-morrow for Yorkshire, and hope to give you a call on my return to town. With best remem- brances, \u2014 I remain, very truly yours, \" Frederic Summerly.\""], [83, "I HAVE NOTHING TO FORGIVE. 75 Dr. Froom read this letter as be sat alone at break fast. When he bad finished it he laid it on the table beside him, and pushed away his chair. \" What a confounded fellow I am !\" he said angrily. \"I wish things would not persist in coming into my head at the wrong time. What could be Vanlyn's object in telling me he could not swim a yard ? Here is indisputable disinterested evidence that he is suffi ciently accomplished in the art not only to save him self, but some one else as well. It can, it must be explained in this way \u2014 I told him to bathe and swim. No doubt he has been doing so for the last month ; some people are very quick at picking things up.\" He turned to the letter once more. \" It is odd,\" he said, \"that these two inseparable friends of Vanlyn's did not know he could swim, if he has been doing so much of it during his stay at Shinglebeach.\" He locked the letter up in his desk. \" No doubt Vanlyn will be able to explain it when we meet.\" \"Going to-morrow, Summerly !\" cried Mr. Banner leigh. His friend made the announcement as they were strolling along together in the cool of the evening on the day after the episode related in Summerly's letter to Dr. Froom. \"Yes,\" he answered, \"I find I had better go.\" He glanced at the two figures walking leisurely on a little in front of them \u2014 Enid and Laurence Vanlyn. \" We must never wholly lose sight of each other"], [84, "76 I HAVE NOTHING TO FORGIVE. again,\" said Mr. Bannerleigh. \" This delightful month will always give me great pleasure to look back upon ; we must arrange next summer to meet again.\" \"It would be very pleasant,\" returned his com panion; \"but probably something will occur before then to interfere with the plan.\" That evening, when Miss Billing was entertaining the company with her melodious strains, Summerly turned to Enid. \"If you have five minutes to spare, give them to me ; I want to speak to you.\" She looked up at him with a smile, and, dividing the curtains, stepped out on the balcony. The balmy air of evening was intensely refreshing after the heat of the room. \" You know I am going away to-morrow,\" he said somewhat suddenly. She looked up quickly, and dropped the fern-leaf she had been holding in her hand. \" Nonsense ! You must not think of it. I am counting upon you for at least two dances to-morrow night, and Miss Billing intends to put her hair in a double quantity of curl-papers in honour of the occa sion. I tell papa he will have to open the ball with Mrs. Blundell.\" \" A dance at Tudor House is certainly a tempting inducement to remain,\" he said, smiling; \"but even that must be resisted, I am afraid. I wanted to see you to-night to give you this,\" taking an envelope out of his pocket."], [85, "77 I HAVE NOTHING TO FORGIVE. \" What is it ?\" she asked. \" My London address. I think at some future time I may be of use to you in your literary work ; and if so, I want you to promise to come to me and give me that pleasure. A letter sent to that address will always find me ; and, if I am in England, I shall be more than happy to be of service to you.\" \" You are very kind,\" she said gratefully. \" When I leave Shinglebeach I shall go on writing ; at present I\u2014 I\u2014\" \" You have, to some extent, lost interest in your work,\" he said. \" I quite understand.\" \"It will come back,\" she said quickly. \" I have an idea that my next book will be an improvement on the last.\" \" So have I.\" \" What have I done to make you think so ?\" she asked, the colour coming into her face. Years afterwards he remembered how she looked that night, with the fair pale moonlight shining down upon her. She was playing with the lace on her dress, and her hand trembled slightly as she did so. \"You have done nothing,\" he answered reassuringly ; \" but surely the materials you have found at Tudor House will be of use to you.\" She gave a little sigh, it seemed to him of relief. \" Ah, yes,\" she said. \"Promise you will let me see your new book.\" \" Certainly I will, if you care to do so ; you shall"], [86, "78 I HAVE NOTHING TO FORGIVE. see it before any one else but papa. I mean to work very hard at it, and soon get it done.\" \" That is right.\" \" On the day that my book is pronounced a success, I shall be the happiest woman in the world.\" Ah, Enid ! will you remember those words, I wonder, when that day comes ? Have you forgotten already that only through the gate of suffering can you reach that giddy height ? Have you forgotten already you must exchange your glittering robe of happiness for the sombre garment of pain ? Think you, when you gaze at your realised ambition through a mist of tears, it will look as brilliant as now ? As Enid pronounced the last word a hand divided the curtains, and Laurence Vanlyn stood before them. \" I beg your pardon,\" he said hastily, and with an annoyed expression on his face. \" Not the slightest occasion, my dear fellow,\" re turned Summerly easily. \" Miss Bannerleigh was be coming slightly bored with my society, although she was far too polite to say so. I must go and pack my portmanteau now ; you had better take my place, it is very pleasant out here.\" He nodded pleasantly and walked away. \" Are you not tired of being out here ?\" said Lawrence Vanlyn, turning to Enid, and still looking unamiable. She appeared a little frightened, like a child who has done something naughty and expects to be scolded. \" I have not been here long.\""], [87, "I HAVE NOTHING TO FORGIVE. 79 He leaned his arms on the balcony, and turned his face, with a moody look upon it, towards the sea. \" I am afraid I am a bad substitute for Summerly,\" he said, in the same tone as before ; \" perhaps you would rather go in now he is gone ?\" She drew up her head. \" Yes,\" she said proudly, \" I will go to papa.\" He turned round quickly, and caught her hand in his before she could do so. \" Stop,\" he said ; \" I want you to tell me something before you go.\" The very contact of his touch took away all her power and all her pride. He still kept her hand in his. \"I could not help overhearing your last words to Summerly,\" he said; \"tell me what they meant. I thought probably he had been making you an offer.\" She tried vainly to withdraw her hand from his clasp. \"He had been doing nothing of the kind,\" she re turned, with a feeble and ineffectual attempt to look angry; \"you have no right to think of such things.\" \" I beg your pardon,\" he said humbly ; \" I have no right to think about you at all, but somehow I can't help it.\" \"I will go to papa,\" said Enid, glancing at the curtains. \" He is really very much engaged just now,\" ob served Laurence Vanlyn, trying to see her face, which she kept persistently turned away from him. \" I left"], [88, "80 I HAVE NOTHING TO FORGIVE. him playing a most amusing game with the Professor. Don't you think it would be rather unfeeling to disturb him ?\" \" I will not disturb him,\" in a low, very unsteady voice. \" Then why not stay with me a little longer?\" She did not answer. \" Are you very angry ?\" he asked, with deep earnest ness in his voice. \" I shall not sleep a wink all night if you do not forgive me ; what can I say to convince you how sorry I am for having offended you ?\" \"Don't say anything, and don't be sorry; it is not worth while.\" \" Then look at me, and say I am forgiven.\" She was trembling violently from head to foot. Surely there was no need for those faltering lips to tell him what he knew so well ; and yet he wanted to hear the old story repeated out here in the moonlight, by this girl whom he had taught to love. It was a very sweet story, and he knew she would tell it very sweetly. \" I have nothing to forgive,\" she said. He put his arm lightly round her and drew her closer to him. \" You don't know how horribly miserable you are making me,\" he said, in a very low voice. Then she turned and looked at him : the tell-tale Drown eyes rested on his with a passionate adoration in them, of which she was wholly, unconscious ; the red lips were terribly near his own. \" Enid, do you think it possible you will ever learn"], [89, "O, FOR THE TOUCH OF A VANISHED HAND ! 81 to care for me a little ?\" he asked teasingly ; and then he stooped his head until his lips rested on her fair shining hair. \"Little witch! bow have you managed to make me so desperately fond of you?\" \"Vanlyn ! Vanlyn! 0, here he is; we were just talking of you,\" said Mr. Bannerleigh. \" Miss Bannerleigh has been telling me a story,\" said Laurence; \"it was so interesting, we forgot to come in. How did the chess go on ?\" \" The Professor checkmated me,\" returned Enid's father. And Enid still stood there like one in a dream, her eyes fixed on the shadowy sea, the last words her lover uttered ringing in her heart, the last look in his eyes engraven on her soul. CHAPTER IX. \" 0, for the touch of a vanished hand, And the sound of a voice that is still !\" Tudor House was full to overflowing, and Mrs. Blundell was in the seventh heaven of delight in con sequence. She extended the length of her dining-table, engaged three extra servants, and scoured Shinglebeach with feminine persistency, until she had found beds for her forty visitors ; and then she smiled complacently on her dearest child, and thought if every one was agreeable they might clear the dining-table out of the way and have a dance. G"], [90, "82 0, FOR THE TOUCH OF A VANISHED HAND ! Every one was quite agreeable, in fact they approved very much of the suggestion. It was from this enter tainment that Mr. Summerly had made up his mind to be absent for reasons best known to himself. Perhaps be fancied under the enchanting influence of the music, and the poetry of waltzing, words might be spoken, confidences exchanged, and secrets told, which it would give him pain to hear. He had an idea that congratu lations would not come as easily from his lips as he wished them to do, so he said good-bye to Enid and her father after luncheon. If by any accident he should miss his train, he thought he could go by the later one at nine-twenty, and perhaps take a peep, just a last one, at Enid in the ballroom, before he went. It was an exciting day at Tudor House. During the time Enid was dressing for the ball there were no less than three knocks at her door. The first proved to be Miss Bella Billing in dire distress. Could Miss Bannerleigh lend her a false fringe ? Their hair was nearly the same colour by gas light. She knew Miss Bannerleigh did not wear a fringe, but she thought she might have one put away somewhere. She (Bella) had had a dreadful accident, and in curling her hair had singed an immense piece off, owing to the tongs being too hot. She felt sure she looked quite too dreadful, and could not possibly appear in the ballroom, &c. Enid really felt very sorry for her ; her distress was so real and the tears were in her eyes ; but she could not lend what she had not got, even for Miss Billing's"], [91, "0, FOR THE TOUCH OF A VANISHED HAND .' 83 consolation ; so she bit her lip nearly through to keep herself from laughing, and offered to perform on the poor singed locks and make the best of them, which she did. The second knock came from the lady occupying the next room to Enid's, a new arrival last week, who had, alas ! taken a great and most inconvenient fancy to hei**, and thought perhaps Miss Bannerleigh might like some large pink artificial roses (there were six of them) put about her dress. Of course she meant it kindly, and Enid felt proportionately grateful, but de clined the roses. The last knock brought a bunch of bright red pop pies (flowers, alas ! that fade and die so quickly), with a little piece of paper attached to them: \"Will you wear these to-night ? You said they were your favourite flowers ; they are mine also. \u2014 Yours, L. V.\" She pressed the note passionately to her lips, and put the poppies in her belt \u2014 just as she did on that sweet unforgotten afternoon in the cornfields \u2014 and some more in the bosom of her white dress \u2014 they were the only colour about her ; and then she went down into the drawing-room, and found her father and Laurence Vanlyn waiting for her. She had carried about with her all day the feeling of his lips on her hair \u2014 that light touch, the magic power of which had thrilled her soul. Laurence Vanlyn had never caught a glimpse of the deep-fringed shy eyes all day. When she talked to him she never once looked at him. He had a great desire to see them now. Never had he looked more indolently handsome than he looked to-night. He was"], [92, "84 0, FOR THE TOUCH OF A VANISHED HAND ! leaning against the frame of a mirror, talking to Mr. Bannerleigh, and watching the door through which the somewhat motley throng came and went in detach ments. As Enid came in, her father rose to meet her, and gave her his arm. Many people noticed how intensely proud he looked of her that night. Laurence Vanlyn felt he was nearer being in love than he ever had been before. The game he was playing was sufficiently dangerous to his peace of mind to be exciting. Well, well, he would enjoy himself to-night at any rate, and make up his mind how he would end this pleasant flirtation \u2014 it teas very pleasant. With this resolution he advanced a step or two to meet Enid and her father. \"I hear the music,\" he said. \"May I have the pleasure of the first dance, Miss Bannerleigh ?\" She was fastening the sixth button of her glove, which perhaps accounted for the fact of her not looking at him. \" Thank you,\" she said ; \" if it is a round one, I shall be delighted. I am going to dance the first square with papa.\" \" Shall, we go and see which it is ?\" he asked ; and then they all three went down-stairs together. It was a waltz, and already three or four couples had begun dancing. \" Come,\" said Laurence Vanlyn, \" we cannot pos sibly stand still while that waltz is going on.\" After they had been dancing for a minute or two he spoke again."], [93, "0, FOR THE TOUCH OF A VANISHED HAND ! 85 \" Why have I been seDt to Coventry all day ?\" \" I did not know you had.\" \" I did. Are you aware you have never once looked at me since we were in the balcony last night ? I wish you would tell me what I have done to make you angry.\" \"Nothing.\" \" Quite sure ?\" \" Quite.\" Another turn round the room in silence. \" Thank you for the poppies,\" said Enid, in rather a small weak voice. \" Thank you for wearing them.\" \" You see those large pink roses on Mrs. Barber's dress ? She very kindly offered them to me,\" said Enid. \"And you refused them ? Incomprehensible ingra titude ! How nice you would have looked with them indiscriminately dotted about here and there, as Mrs. Barber has artistically arranged them ! On the whole, I am inclined to prefer the poppies.\" \" So am I,\" agreed Enid, laughing. \"What in the world is that extraordinary evolution the Professor is executing?\" said Laurence. \"He looks frantic. I dare not dwell on the probable result of a collision ; let us stop till he is exhausted. Look at him now !\" The Professor's dancing was indeed truly wonder ful. He was a rather stout man, who wore spectacles ; his eyes, which at all times were rather prominent,"], [94, "86 0, FOR THE TOUCH OF A VANISHED HAND ! appeared, in the agonies of waltzing, to be literally bolting out of his head. He was clutching at Bella Billing's amber satin skirts with an energy that made you shudder, and running madly around her with frightful velocity, utterly regardless of the shins and elbows of the other dancers. His coat-tails stood straight out, his hair became erect. One by one the others stopped, and looked with wonder and wrath on the terrible spectacle he and his unfortunate partner presented. At length they stopped. \" It was lovely, divine !\" gasped Bella, tucking in the hairpins which had been loosened, and stuck out of her hair like spikes. The Professor was at present incapable of a reply; his countenance was hidden from view by his pocket-handkerchief. \"Yes,\" he agreed at length, \"it was nice. These people did not seem to know how to dance. Did not Miss Billing find the room rather warm ?\" \" He is quite purple,\" said Enid, looking after him. \" Do you think it will bring on apoplexy?\" \" It is not improbable,\" returned Laurence, laughing. \" Supposing he asks me to dance with him ?\" said Enid. Involuntarily he pressed the hand resting on his arm closer to his side. \" I would not see you in such danger for a thousand pounds,\" he said quickly. \" Remember, if he asks you, you are engaged to me.\" \"Supposing you are engaged to some one else?\" looking up at him."], [95, "0, FOR THE TOUCH OF A VANISHED HAND ! 87 \"So at last your Majesty has condescended to look at me ! How many more waltzes will you give me, Aphrodite ? I have no intention of dancing with any one else to-night, so spare me as many as you can. Happily, we need not consult Mrs. Grundy as to the regulation number ; the chances are we shall never see any of these people again.\" \" As many as you like,\" she answered, \" if papa does not mind.\" They strolled along towards Mr. Bannerleigh. \" This is our dance, papa,\" she said brightly. \" Mr. Vanlyn, do ask Mrs. Blundell to dance with you and be our vis-a-vis.\" \" That you may have the pleasure of laughing at us?\" \" Yes ; I am convinced she will do all the steps, and hold up her dress on each side between her thumb and finger, as she used to do in ' the 'appy days of 'eedless girlhood forty years ago, when poor dear Blundell came a-courting.' \" She mimicked Mrs. Blundell's tone and manner to perfection : she lifted her dress just sufficiently to show her white slipper, pointed her toe, and looked up at her father and Mr. Vanlyn with the fully-developed sense of the ridiculous which she possessed shining in her eyes. It was the embodiment of a picture. The pose was simply perfect; her white dress and the bunches of scarlet poppies contrasted in their simplicity with the gaudy costumes of the other dancers. And she looked"], [96, "88 0, FOR THE TOUCH OF A VANISHED HAND ! happy \u2014 intensely, inexpressibly happy. It was the last glimpse Mr. Summerly had of her, and he never forgot it; when his eyes next rested on her, this vision came back to him with the most painful vividness. \" She will never look happier than that,\" he said to himself. \"I wish I was sure she would never feel less so.\" He had missed his train, and returned for a few minutes to Tudor House, just to peep into the ball room. He slipped quietly away from the door at which he had been standing, and left the house. If he had stayed, it is possible Enid Bannerleigh's life might have ended differently ; but it was not to be. As he turned his back on Tudor House, one of the four prin cipal actors in the Shinglebeach drama had played his part, and disappeared for a time from view. \" If you very much wish to see me look ridiculous,\" said Vanlyn, \"you shall be gratified. Remember, if I dance with Mrs. Blundell, you have promised to be our vis-a-vis.\" The evening advanced. Laurence Vanlyn, when he was not dancing or sitting out with Enid, stood moodily watching her. He knew he was running a terrible risk of making a fool of himself, and that his flirtation was attaining a serious aspect. He was certainly more in love than he ever remembered to have been before (except once perhaps, long, long ago), and he had succeeded in making this child in the ways of the world immensely fond of him ; she believed implicitly"], [97, "0, FOR THE TOUCH OF A VANISHED HAND ! 89 in him, and the almost forgotten sensation of being believed in was delightful. It was midnight. In measured tones the church clock struck the hour, and still the feet of the dancers tripped gaily ; still the energetic Professor whirled madly around ; still Laurence Vanlyn's arm encircled the waist of the girl he was, in spite of himself, becoming more and more in love with. \" Are you engaged for the next dance ?\" he asked. \"No.\" \" Then let us sit, it out in the drawing-room ; this room is insufferably hot.\" She laid her hand lightly on his arm, and they went up-stairs together. Miss Billing junior and two other forlorn damsels were informing each other that they had only sat out \" once \" all the evening. They knew the assertion was palpably false, but they made it unblushingly all the same. \" Come on the balcony,\" said Laurence ; \" it is the only place where one can get a breath of fresh air. Are you afraid of taking cold ?\" \" Not in the least,\" answered Enid ; and then she realised that she was alone with Laurence Vanlyn. Faintly the voices of the forlorn damsels came to them blended with the sound of distant music. Without, everything was intensely still, not a foot step passing ; only the sound of a man's voice, low and passionate, broke the silence. \"Enid,\" he said, \"I asked you last night if you"], [98, "90 0, FOR THE TOUCH OF A VANISHED HAND ! thought you might ever learn to care for me. You did not answer then; will you answer now V \" Why do you ask me ?\" she said faintly. \" Because I want desperately to know.\" She pushed her hair from her forehead with cold, trembling fingers ; there was a wild reckless beauty in the eyes that met his. \" Then since you make me tell you, I do love you. I think I have loved you since the first moment I saw you. I know very surely that as long as I live I shall never love any one else.\" He took her in his arms and kissed her passionately. \" My darling,\" he said, \"my beautiful little love, how have I managed to live for thirty years without you ? Are you quite sure you will never care for any one else? Tell me so again.\" \"Quite sure,\" she answered, with conviction. \"I could never care twice in the same way ; as long as I live I shall love you with my whole soul.\" There was silence utter and complete ; a sound in the distance broke it. \" Hark !\" cried Laurence Vanlyn, \" what is that ?\" His arms trembled, he raised his head and listened intently. Enid heard nothing but his voice, saw nothing but his face, across which a deadly pallor was stealing. \" What is it ?\" she asked, \" what do you hear ?\" \" Music, some one playing on a violin. I was haunted by the sound of it at night for weeks before I came here,\" he said rapidly and almost breathlessly :"], [99, "0, FOR THE TOUCH OF A VANISHED HAND ! 91 \" it is a trick of the imagination, a delusion of the brain. I left London with the hope that change of air and scene might cure me ; I thought it had. I never heard the music at Shinglebeach until to-night.\" Suddenly the fear that had come into her face left it, and she smiled. \" It is no delusion,\" she said. \" I can hear it too. Look ! it is the handsome Italian boy I saw to-day on the beach ; he is coming quite near, playing on his violin.\" Laurence Vanlyn staggered back like a man who had been shot ; then he pushed aside the curtain, and without a word of explanation left the room. For a few seconds Enid listened mechanically to the melancholy music ; then she aroused herself and went down-stairs. \" Papa,\" she said, going to him, \" I think Mr. Vanlyn is ill. Will you go to his room, and see if he is there?\" Mr. Bannerleigh looked at her pale face and startled eyes with dismay. \" Vanlyn ill !\" he said. \" Where is he ?\" \"I don't know, papa; he was in the drawing-room with me a few minutes ago : he went away quite suddenly.\" Mr. Bannerleigh took her to a chair. \" Sit down, my dear ; I will go and look for him.\" She obeyed with troubled eyes, and parched dry lips, upon which she could feel even now the warm kisses of her lover."], [100, "92 0, FOR THE TOUCH OF A VANISHED HAND ! In a few minutes Mr. Bannerleigh returned. \" Vanlyn had a slight attack of dizziness,\" he said reassuringly: \" he was subject to it some time ago; he thinks the dancing brought it on, and hopes he did not frighten you.\" \" Did you see him, papa ?' \" 0 yes'.\" \" How did he look ?\" \" Rather pale, that was all. I advised him not to come down again, and he thought the advice worth acting upon. He will be quite well to-morrow, Enid.\" She gave a little gasp of relief. \" I was frightened,\" she said. \" Don't you think we have had almost enough of this?\" said Mr. Bannerleigh. \"Let us follow Van lyn's example, and go to bed.\" She felt in no mood for remaining there, and was thankful for the suggestion. When she was at last alone in her room she sat down to think, and her eyes caught the bunch of faded, crushed poppies in her dress. She took them out and kissed them tenderly. \" Poor poppies,\" she whispered, \"you are like every thing else that is beautiful, you come quickly to an end.\" After some hours she fell into an uneasy sleep, and awoke to find it was ten o'clock. All night long she had been dreaming of Laurence Vanlyn. Some times they were scratching their names on the old gray stones of the ruin, and a true lover's knot beneath ; sometimes they were wandering together in the corn fields, where the poppies turned into dancers, with faces"], [101, "0, FOR THE TOUCH OF A VANISHED HAND ! 93 like the Professor's and Mrs. Blundell's and the Miss Billings'; sometimes that the Italian boy with the won derful melancholy eyes, which seemed to be perpetually gazing on the infinite, the boy whom she had watched with much interest that morning on the beach, was playing weird music on his violin. Then it all changed again, and she was with Laurence Vanlyn on the balcony, while he \" Whispered in the moonlight Words the sweetest she had known ; How he charmed away the hours, Till her heart was all his own !\" \"I feel very selfish to be so enormously happy,\" she said to herself; \" it will be hard on daddy to part with me, and he has been so unselfish about it all the way through, when he could see how much we cared for each other. I think there will be no need to tell him how happy I am, he will see it in my face.\" A knock at the door broke up her reverie. Enid started. \" A note for you, miss,\" said the servant. Enid took it and looked at the writing; then she pressed it to her lips, just as she had done the slip of paper around the poppies last night. \" My first love-letter,\" she said, and opened it. \" I am writing you a line of farewell. For your sake and mine it is inevitable. I think I went mad last night ; forgive me, and forget the short pleasant dream we have indulged in as soon as you can.

L. V.\" Enid read the note through twice, the second time quite mechanically, and then she raised her eyes, eyes that were burning like balls of fire, to the mirror. As she gazed her face seemed to age by years ; the lovely merry eyes had grown intensely pathetic and sad ; they looked too full of suffering ever to be merry again, she thought. \" So that is the end,\" she said, in a hollow unna tural voice; then she stretched out her hands to the faded poppies with a piteous little gesture she could not control, and took them up tenderly, as if they could feel pain. \" My generosity /\" she said dully. \" What is generosity ?\" She put her hand to her head, and staggered back against the wall. \" I want to think, and \u2014 I can't.\" After a time she spoke again. \" I thought he was a god,\" she said, \" and I wor shipped him. Heaven help me ! I worship him still. Was ever woman so contemptibly infatuated as I ?\" She took his letter and the poppies and the little note of last night, and laid them on the hearth ; then she struck a match, and burned them to ashes. \" My generosity is to shield him from the shadow of reproach,\" she said. Mr. Bannerleigh had breakfasted, and was reading"], [103, "0, FOR THE TOUCH OF A VANISHED HAND ! 95 his newspaper in the drawing-room, waiting for Enid. He was not surprised after last night's dissipation to find she was, like most of the people at Tudor House, rather late. He had seen and heard nothing of Lau rence Vanlyn ; he thought, perhaps, that gentleman had gone to indulge in a bathe before breakfast. \" Well, papa,\" said Enid, coming in, \" how are you ? Very tired after last night's frivolity ?\" Something in the gaiety of her voice struck him very forcibly ; the unnatural brilliancy of her eyes, that had in them a piteous suffering expression, frightened him. \" I am afraid you are knocked up, my child,\" he said anxiously ; \" you have not slept well.\" \" Not very well, papa. I was dancing in my dreams, which you know is terribly fatiguing,\" with a laugh, the falseness of which could deceive no one. \" Have you been down long, papa ?\" \" About an hour, my dear. Enid, how cold your hand is, and your head \u2014 as hot as fire !\" \" Do you think it is the result of the negus ?

She was most obvi ously acting a part, and her father knew it as well as she did. \" Gone where ?\" \" I don't know, papa ; he has left Shinglebeach. Mr. Bannerleigh was thunderstruck. \" How do you know, my dear ? There must be some mistake.\" \" He very considerately sent me a little note to say so ; he was obliged to go. I suppose he was afraid if he sent it to you it might disturb your slumbers.\" \"It is so extraordinary that he said nothing about having to go away when he was with us last night,\" said Mr. Bannerleigh, looking anxiously at his daugh ter. \" Such friends as we have been for the last month.\" \"Perhaps he did not know or had not made up bis mind then,\" said Enid lightly ; \" men are such creatures of impulse, daddy.\" \" Where is the note, Enid ?\" \"It was the merest scrap of paper,\" returned the girl bravely. \" I burned it with some other things of equal value before I came down.

In Mr. Vanlyn's case, for instance, I have no doubt we shall quite miss him for two or three days, perhaps for a week, and be as flat and stupid as possible at first. I feel quite obliged to him for departing so abruptly, and saving us the discomfort of saying good-bye. He was really very nice, was not be ? Do you think if we cultivated the Professor he would do as well ?\" That terribly piteous little laugh cut Mr. Banner leigh to the heart ; if she would only have laid her bead on his shoulder, and sobbed her heart out, it would have hurt him infinitely less. \" Go and fetch your hat, and come out with me,\" he said kindly; and then, as she left him, he looked sadly after her. \" Poor little lassie, she thinks she is deceiving me, perhaps sparing me unhappiness ! She must go her own way. By and by she may tell me all about it. How I wish she would not try to laugh. It is the most dreadful sound I ever listened to.\" She came back humming a tune, and with her favourite volume of Tennyson's poems in her hand. \" What do you say to giving up the boating expe dition, and being idle on the beach, papa ?\" she said. \" I have a great idea I should enjoy it, if you would read aloud to me.\" As they walked along, she still talked excitedly and rapidly about everything she could think of.

Very well, what will you read ?\" \"Anything you like.\" \" Read ' Break, break, break !' it will be delight fully appropriate ; don't you think so ?\" Mr. Bannerleigh was thankful to read anything to save her the terrible effort which she insisted upon making.

THE IRONY OF FATE Eight months had passed away since Mr. Sum merly looked into the ballroom at Tudor House. As he sat in his easy-chair and smoked, his thoughts wandered back to the old Shinglebeach days ; he had never heard a word of or from one of the people with whom he had so continually been during that pleasant month. The Bannerleighs had not written, and he did not know their address. He heard from Dr. Froom that Laurence Vanlyn was abroad somewhere, it was not clear where ; all the others passed out of his life as they came into it, with very little interest and much amusement. \" The chances are that Enid is married by now,\" he reflected : \" some day I shall probably receive an invitation to meet Mr. and Mrs. Vanlyn at dinner. Poor Bannerleigh, he will find life desolate without that bright ray of sunlight near him. The postman's knock ! I wonder what he has for me to-night ?\" Only one letter, apparently. Mr. Summerly looked at the writing, and opened it hastily. \" London, March 4th, 1& \u2014 . \"Dear Mr. Summerly, \u2014 I promised when we said good-bye at Shinglebeach that as soon as my novel was finished you should see it.

He sends his kindest regards and remembrances ; and I mine. \u2014 Believe me most sincerely yours, \" Enid Bannerleigh.\" \" What a curious note !\" mused Mr. Summerly. \" No address, no information to speak of, and a request to meet her in the Park at ten o'clock in the morning. Why does she not ask me to call upon her at her own bouse ? It is very mysterious and unusual.\" However, at a quarter to ten he was at the place of appointment. At that hour there were very few peo- ple about, and those who passed looked curiously at him. He walked up and down, thinking of Enid, of her merry bright ways, her gay laugh and springing step. Then ne looked impatiently at his watch : five minutes past ten, and she had not come. He leaned his arms on the bridge and looked down into the water, lost in thought. Some one touched his arm ; he started and looked round. A woman stood beside him, with pale thin cheeks and big wistful brown eyes ; she was dressed shabbily in black, and her clothes hung about her as if she had grown terribly thin since they were made. \" Don't you know me ?\" she said. He knew her voice. \" Yes,\" he answered, taking"], [109, "101 THE IRONY OF FATE. her hand in his, \" I should know you anywhere, Miss Bannerleigh.\" She smiled. \"It is immensely good of you to come,\" she said ; \" I am more grateful than I can say.\" He tried to look at her, he tried to become accus tomed to the terrible change in her. \" Please don't say that. Is this your book ?\" taking a parcel from her. \" Yes,\" she returned ; \"I hope it is better than the last,\" with another smile. \"I have been working rather hard at it.\" \"Too hard,\" he said. \"Come, sit down and tell me all that has happened since we parted at Shingle beach.\" They walked to a seat and sat down. \"We are living in London now,\" she said, coming to the point, it seemed to him, with a plunge ; \" papa lost his money, and we are rather poor.\" Rather poor ! He looked at her worn gloves, her shabby boots, her sunken cheeks, and with difficulty suppressed a shudder. \" Poor child !\" he said ; \" and your father ?\" \" Papa is very ill : he had a paralytic stroke ; the doctors said it was brought on by the shock, and he has never walked since. He looks, 0, quite an old man, and his hair is as white as snow.

Her answer reassured him. \" Please sell it for anything you can get over twenty pounds,\" she said eagerly ; \" do you think it likely he will give as much ?\" \" More than that, I feel certain.\" \" The lodgings we are in are killing papa,\" she said ; \" I must get him into some better ones, if I can only afford it.\""], [111, "103 THE IRONY OF FATE. \" I shall see this gentleman to-morrow night \u2014 Thursday,\" said Mr. Summerly, making the most of Enid's utter ignorance of business details and proceed ings. \" If he buys the book, he will pay for it at once ; I will call upon you on Saturday, and let you know what I have done.\" \" May I call upon you instead ?\" she asked, her lips quivering ; \"I would rather : I do not want you to see what we have come to.\" \" For pity's sake don't talk like that !\" he said. \" Surely you know that nothing could make the smallest difference to me.\" \" It is not that,\" she said ; \" it is my own fault, Mr. Summerly. I am just a little bit proud even now : I want you to remember us as we were!' It was the very thing he did not wish to do, the thing that of all others made him the most sad when he looked at her now. He forbore to press it further. \" It shall be as you wish,\" he said : \" come to my house in Empress Gate on Saturday, at any time you like.\" \" Three o'clock ?\" \" That will do admirably.\" \" Good-bye,\" she said, holding out her hand, \" and a thousand times thank you.\" \" I will walk with you.\" \" Only to the end of the Park, please.\" \"As far as I may.\" When they got to the gates she bade him farewell, and left him ; and then he called a cab and drove home."], [112, "104 THE IRONY OF FATE. Enid and her news had been a terrible shock to him, one he found it almost impossible to forget. \" Perhaps her novel may tell me something of her life,\" he thought : \" I may find between the lines a piteous story unconsciously written there.\" Forty-eight Ghoul's Buildings, Westminster, was not, strictly speaking, a distinguished address. On the third floor, in a room very little better than an attic, Mr. Bannerleigh and his daughter had taken up their abode. Mrs. Sims, who rented the house and took lodgers, was an unamiable specimen of the landlady tribe. The one overworked, domestic, who answered to the name of Rose, slept in the kitchen, and apparently had a rooted antipathy to the use of soap and water. The other lodgers were mostly people who followed a precarious mode of existence, and did not stay long in one place. On the second floor lived a man who played the violin in the orchestra of an obscure theatre, with his wife and family, consisting of six children; to judge from the mingled sounds of mirth and sorrow which proceeded from the second floor, they were possessed of good lungs and exercised them freely. Day by day Mr. Bannerleigh was getting weaker. To Enid the change was only too apparent : he talked little now, and took no interest in the doings of the outer world, or the events of the day ; he seemed to have done with them, and as it were laid them aside, like a garment never to be worn again. The strain of keeping up, in spite of the awful load of misery that was weighing down her soul, was the"], [113, "105 THE IRONY OF FATE. hardest thing Enid had to do. To be cheerful and bright ; to relate the most commonplace events, or depict the mistakes and blunders of Rose in a way to bring a faint smile to her father's lips ; to sit up far into the small hours writing and studying, almost without hope that the dawn of a brighter day would ever come, counting the few remaining shillings that must buy food and fire for so long unless Mr. Summerly 's friend accepted her novel. Ah, how much depended upon that one chance about which she dare not hope ! This was now Enid Bannerleigh's life, these the thoughts that filled her mind as she sat in the cheerless, tireless garret that was her home, with her head buried in her hands. 0, the unrest of the great city ! the pitiless unrest, the never-ceasing din : the cry of poor humanity that is for ever echoing itself and meeting with no other response. \"0 merciful God!\" she cried, \"I cannot bear it much longer \u2014 I cannot hear it /\" She rose unsteadily, and, half staggeringacross the room to the window, raised the blind, and looked out on the chimney-pots. The moon was shining brightly clown upon them, and upon a cab which rattled past. Then the Abbey clock struck four. To Enid it sounded like the passing bell tolling for a departed soul. She shuddered and dropped the blind. \"I have heard that people often die at four o'clock,\" she said ; \" perhaps now, quite close to me, some one is learning the grand secret of death ; perhaps in this very street, in the next house \u2014 even in this \u2014 \" She did not"], [114, "106 THE IRONY OF FATE. finish the sentence, but her hands met in an agonised, convulsive clasp, and her eyes gleamed wildly in the faint wretched light. \" No, no, not yet ! Good Lord, I can bear anything but that !\" In an agony of apprehension, she crept into her father's room and leaned over him. Yes, he was sleep ing, but the sad look was still on his face : the look that wrung her heart, and when he was awake was so thinly covered by the old sweet smile of bygone days. As she looked at him all he had to suffer came vividly before her mind. \"Poor daddy, poor darling !\" she said, and she knew that her last prayer had been a cruel and selfish one. Why should she ask God to let him live for this ? why should she wish his bodily and mental suffering to be prolonged ? Only because she wanted him with her still ; only because he was her all, and she could not do without him. Could not.' What senseless words, what useless, unavailing words, which we are for ever repeating, not seeing their folly ! She stooped over his thin white hand and kissed it; it was such a shapely, beautiful hand even now, a model for a sculptor. How often it had passed lovingly over her head ! \" Poor daddy !\" she whispered again ; and then went back to her farthing candle, and the little story on which, half an hour ago, she wrote \" Finis.\" For hours the fire had been out ; the wind whistled drearily through the crack in the window-pane, and moved the blind backwards and forwards.

To Enid Bannerleigh He sent sleep. \" Lord-a-mercy-me, miss !\" cried Rose, blundering into the room at eight o'clock, her face decorated with a little superfluous blacking not required for the first \" floorer's \" boots, \" ain't you been in bed all night ?\" Enid raised her head wearily from the table on which it had been resting. \" I did not think I was tired, and I had some work to do. Is it morning, Rose ?\" \" Why, yes, miss, and time to see about your pa's breakfast \" (dropping half the coal off her shovel on the floor). \" There, that's all the fault of the death-watch as I beared so plain last night ; it has shook me like. Did you hear it, miss ? it's a sure sign of death. Just affore my uncle's wife's sister was took, I heard it as plain as plain. And last night I thought of your pa/miss, and I says to myself, I says, ' Sure enough, that means the poor gentleman on the third floor won't last long.' \" \" Nonsense, Rose !\" exclaimed Enid ; \"please don't talk like that. I do not believe in such things ; I am not superstitious ;\" but she shuddered, nevertheless."], [116, "CHAPTER XI. \"GO TO THE TRIUMPH WHICH AWAITS YOU \" \" Papa, you are eating no dinner !\" The invalid, who had been playing with his knife and fork, and trying to hide from Enid the utter impossibility of swallowing a mouthful of the greasy, burnt, half-raw chop upon his plate, looked up at her with the old sweet smile. \"I am not hungry, my darling. I \u2014 I don't think I can manage any more, Enid.\" \"No,\" she said, taking the plate away, while a look of hunted misery came into her eyes, \"it is not nice, you cannot eat it. 0, daddy,\" her voice suddenly giving way, \" if I could only get you decent food, some thing that would do you good !

Your success has become the dream of my life ; promise me you will never relinquish it.\" \" Daddy, darling,\" she said, twining her lithe young arms about him, while tears made her voice unsteady, \" I am going to succeed.

A strange reluctance to leave him filled her soul. \" I wish I was not obliged to go to-day,\" she said ; \" I would rather stay with you.\" \" Let me look at you once again before you go,\" he said; \" then I shall fancy you are beside me, and not be dull or lonely.\" She took off her hat that he could the better see her face.

He had learned the story of Enid's life from her novel, and it struck him as very pathetic ; he could not get it or her out of his mind all day. \"Success at last!\" cried Enid. \"0, how happy daddy will be ! How am I to break the good news to him ? Although he pretended to expect it, it will be a wonderful surprise to him. How slowly the man drives !

The great day of triumph is here, the day you have longed for.\" Still he did not speak. She stooped lower and pressed her lips on his. Then a cry rang through the house \u2014 a cry that seemed, to those who heard it, to be sounding in their ears for days afterwards. \" 0, my God ! too late, too late ! \" Yes, he was dead, with the old sweet smile on his face.

All the sorrow and suffering were gone, and in their place reigned now the mysterious unquestioning peace which passet'h all human understanding \u2014 he had crossed the great borderland of faith in things unseen, and he knew. And Enid was alone, alone in mighty cruel London. It was Sunday afternoon, and most of the inhabitants of Ghoul's Buildings were asleep. Poor souls, they worked hard, terribly hard some of them, during the week, and on Sunday it seemed to them good to rest. Their minds stagnated just as their bodies laboured, but while they recognised the need of rest for the one they entirely ignored the need of exercise for the other. An undefined anxiety had filled Mr. Summerly's mind since his last interview with Enid. \" So this is the place she lives in,\" he said to him self, with a shudder, as the cab, having deposited him on the doorstep, drove away. He rang the bell twice, but no one responded to the summons. \" Perhaps they are all out,\" he thought, making a third and final effort to arouse the sleepers. It proved successful.

I shall be down in a minute.\" And her head disappearing, the window was shut with a bang. Mr. Summerly looked at his gloves, at the big bunch ef violets in his hand, at the handle of the door, and then he turned it as requested, and walked in. Owing to a large hole in the mat his entrance was not attended with either elegance or dignity, but after groping about in the dark for a few minutes he succeeded in finding the staircase, and tumbled up. On the second floor he encountered the youngest hope of the musician's family, roaring lustily (her face besmeared with treacle) because her elder brother had deprived her of a penny trumpet, upon which he was performing with vigour. Mr. Summerly presented the disputants with a penny each on the extraction of a promise that the tears and the music should be post poned, and left them with wonder depicted on their faces. A few more dark narrow stairs, and he found him self on the third floor. He knocked at the first door he came to, and thinking some one bade him \" Come in,\" he opened it and then stopped. The fading light of the dying day but faintly illu minated the room \u2014 0, so scantily furnished, so cold"], [125, "117 TOO LATE. and desolate ! There were no signs of a long illness there, only the one great sign of death. Yea, the visible pre sence of the great king himself reigning right royally. Beside the bed, with her head resting against her father's, knelt Enid. Mr. Summerly comprehended the situation at a glance, and then, without a moment's hesitation, he did the kindest thing in his power. \" Miss Bannerleigh,\" he said, going to her, \" I have come to help you ; will you let me be of any use I can ?\" She raised her head, and looked at him as she might have looked at a stranger ; all remembrance seemed to have died with that desolate, terrible cry. \" He is dead,\" she said wearily, just as she said it to the landlady and the undertaker; and then she turned away again, still with that mute tearless misery in her eyes. \" Poor child 1\" he said gently. \" You do not say it is a happy release, he is better off, and things of that sort,\" she said, putting her hand to her head ; \" that is what the other people say : why don't you ?\" \" I understand you too well ; you must remember I am your friend.\" \" You understand me ?\" she said incredulously, looking into bis face. \"0, yes, yes !\" excitedly ; \"I remember now. You promised to come and see him ; you sold my book for me. I came home with my good news, and \u2014 and \u2014 I can tell you, thank God, I can tell you, and you will understand ; it has been burning up my heart like fire ever since. I came back to tell him,"], [126, "118 TOO LATE. and he was quite dead ; he never heard it, he died alone waiting for me ! How do I know,\" beating her hands wildly together, \" that he did not call to me, that he did not cry 'Enid, Enid !' when I was miles away and could not hear him ? 0, do you think he suffered much ? do you think he was very desolate ? Daddy, daddy, did you want me ? 0 my poor darling !\" In an agony of grief she threw herself upon the floor, and the first tears she had shed since her father's death shook her feeble frame like a mighty torrent which has at last broken its banks. With kind strong hands Mr. Summerly raised her, and then said firmly but very gently, \" My child, can you look at him and doubt that he died perfectly content and happy ? You must not doubt it. If he had an anxious thought, it was for you. If he were here now and could look into my heart, he would say, ' Enid, here is the man who is your friend, the man who is waiting to help you in every way in his power ; make use of him just as if he were your brother, a great strong elder brother,'\" tightening his clasp a little. \"He would say that, if he could read the very deepest, most sacred thoughts of my heart.\" \" Thank you,\" she said simply. \"0, it is such a relief to cry.\" \"Yes,\" he answered, \" I know it is \"Will you come into the other room?\" she asked after a pause, in which she had become calmer ; \" I can talk better there.\" \"Yes,\" he answered again, \"it will be best.\""], [127, "119 TOO LATE. He held the door open for her to pass out, and then closed it softly, and followed her to the miserable room that looked ten times more desolate since the invalid's chair became empty, and the ring of feigned cheerfulness in Enid's voice silent. She almost fell into the chair and laid her head against it, she was so worn and exhausted ; he took another a little way from her. \"Did you know about it when you came here to day?\" she asked. \" No, I had no idea of it till I came into the room,\" he answered, looking at the sweet-scented violets in his hand. \" It must have been a great shock to you ; they ought to have told you.\" \" I am very thankful I came. I have brought you some violets,\" laying them on her knee, \" if you care to have them.\" \"That was very kind, \"she said, pressing them against her lips. \" They were his favourite flowers,\" the tears coming into her eyes again ; \" but I could not buy them for him, not even a few violets, we were so terribly poor, every penny was precious. You do not know what a dreadful life it has been for him,\" looking round the miserably furnished room. \"He is quite happy now ; try and think of that.\" \" Yes, I will try.\" \" You will let me make all arrangements for you,\" he said gently ; \" it is not right you should have more to do than is absolutely necessary.\""], [128, "120 TOO LATE. \" I am very helpless,\" she said, with a forlorn little smile through her tears ; \"I shall be deeply grateful for your help.\" \" And I for your confidence. Now, will you tell me what you are going to do ? You cannot live alone.\" \"I have not thought of myself.\" \" That is very natural,\" he said, as lightly as he could, beating down with all his strength the horror with which her helplessness and inexperience filled him. \" Have you any relations or friends in London whom I could fetch ?\" She shook her head slowly from side to side. There was a far-off, absent look in her eyes that was very piteous to behold ; the one subject upon which she could concentrate her mind was her father, and now they were talking of him no longer. \" Did Mr. Bannerleigh express any wish about your future ?\" he asked anxiously. \" Yes ; there was a letter written soon after we came here, to be sent, in case of his death, to some distant connection \u2014 his brother's widow, I think. Papa saw her once, but he did not like her. The letter is in his desk.\" Mr. Summerly gave a sigh of relief. \" Let me post it for you,\" he said eagerly; \"it is terrible to think of you here alone.\" \" I don't want to go to my relations,\" she said wearily ; \"I can do very well by myself now I can earn some money.\" \" Nonsense !\" he returned quickly. \" I know more of the world than you do, and I say it is quite"], [129, "TOO LATE. 121 impossible ; besides \u2014 \" stopping suddenly, fearing be bad said too much, \" if your father wished you to go.\" \"Yes, yes, of course I will go.\" With trembling hands she took the letter out of the well-worn desk and gave it to him. \" You will post it for me,\" she said; \"papa wished it to go.\" \"Will you tell me what you know of your future home ?\" he said kindly, trying to lead her mind from the one great subject which was absorbing it, and also to satisfy his own desire to learn the sort of people with whom she was to live. \" I know very little about the place or the people,\" she answered. \" My uncle died ten years ago, after marrying a widow with one son. They live in some desolate out-of-the-way place in the fens. I have seen neither of them, and that is all I know about them.\" \"You will be glad of the rest and fresh air of the country after this,\" he said, \" and you will have plenty of time for work. I shall want a new book as soon as you feel up to writing one.\" She put her hand to her head again, and pushed her hair off her forehead ; it was a little habit she had acquired when trying to collect her ideas. \" I could not write a word to save my life,\" she said, looking round with a frightened expression in her eyes. \" Supposing the power has left me and I can never write any more, what shall I do ?\" \" You will make a great name some day, and write another very clever book,\" he said reassuringly; \"but"], [130, "122 TOO LATE. not yet ; you must rest, and before long the old hope and the old power will come back again, never fear. Do not worry about anything ; if you want me, I am always at your service \u2014 please remember that.\" \" I don't know how to thank you,\" she said feebly. \"I\u2014 I\u2014\" \" Shall I tell you ?\" he asked, taking her band in his. \"Yes, please. \" By taking great care of yourself. Try to eat something and get some sleep, and when I come to morrow let me find you better. Will you promise ?\" \" You will really come again !\" she said eagerly. \"I think if I had been alone much longer I should have gone mad. I could not \u2014 I could \u2014 could not cry.\" It seemed almost cruel to leave her, and yet he had no alternative. \" Good-bye,\" he said ; \" you will remember ?\" \" Yes, thank you.\" He left her standing by the table, one hand resting on it to support her, in the other the violets. The sight and the scent of violets will always bring that day and that scene back to his mind. On the stairs he met Rose. She was certainly the dirtiest specimen of humanity he had had the mis fortune to encounter lately. \"Are you the person who attends upon Miss Bannerleigh ?\" he asked, with an unpleasant conviction that her reply would be in the affirmative. \" Yes, sir, I do what I can.\""], [131, "123 MAXWELL LYNDERN. Mr. Summerly gave her five shillings. \" You must get her some tea and something fit to eat at once, do you understand ? and take all the care of her you can. I am a friend of hers,\" he added by way of explanation, in reply to the stare of astonish ment on Rose's face. \"I shall call upon her again to-morrow. Now, I want to see your mistress.\" Rose, still dumb with astonishment, led the way, and Mrs. Sims learned that, after all, Miss Bannerleigh was not quite so friendless as she had anticipated. CHAPTER XIII. MAXWELL LYNDERN Enid never knew how it was all managed, she never inquired why Mrs. Sims and Rose suddenly became so thoughtful and attentive, or why a great bush and peace seemed to have fallen over the house. She only sat by the fire (which Rose kept big and bright), generally with a bunch of sweet violets in her lap \u2014 sat there hour after hour, going over her life, thinking out the many changes in it, and unconsciously listening for the big strong brother who had taken all her burdens on his own shoulders and let her rest. She could not work or read, and she could not have written two words to save her life. It was just rest that she wanted : the strain of the past weeks had been so awful, she was practically unable to arouse herself to action when the strain was over, and the actual necessity for doing so removed."], [132, "124 MAXWELL LYNDERN. And in those hours Lawrence Vanlyn very often occupied her thoughts. She looked back upon the old Shinglebeach days as if years instead of months divided her from them, the beautiful dream that brought such pleasure and such pain. In her heart she often made excuses for him ; very often she found herself loudly pleading on his behalf against herself. What a child she was in those days before she knew what poverty and sorrow were ! Was it likely that a man of the world, a star in society, would really care for her ? It was very kind of him to amuse her and devote so much time to her, and if she in her ignorance misunderstood his motives, was it his fault ? And yet he was just a little cruel to make her love him so much. It was thought less, if not cruel : she was so blithe and happy before then, before he taught her to love and suffer, before the voice of the silver sea murmured such a deathless poem in her ears. \"It was not his fault, it was not his fault,\" she repeated, dreamily looking into the fire : \" did I not blindly and deliberately seal my own fate when I chose suffering, if with it came fame and success ? I have had my desire.\" Six days had slowly dragged themselves away, and still Enid sat by the fire alone. She had not heard a word from her affectionate relative in reply to her father's letter, and at present the omission caused her no anxiety \u2014 nothing seemed to matter. O, how drearily the March wind whistled round the end of the narrow street ! It sobbed and wailed, and seemed to be trying to lift its mournful voice above the"], [133, "125 MAXWELL LYNDERN. discordant sounds of the barrel-organ, which the Whitechapel native, in Swiss costume, was grinding so vigorously. A young man in a pair of hobnail boots and a mackintosh rang the bell at 48 Ghoul's Buildings. The before-mentioned boots (without which he stood six feet two) were covered with mud, his hands were not particularly clean, and a strong flavour of tobacco smoke pervaded his garments ; but in spite of these indisputable drawbacks, which would cause a shock to sensitive and aristocratic nerves, he gave one the impression of being, in vulgar parlance, \" a jolly good fellow, an Englishman to the backbone,\" which in truth he was. His first exclamation after Rose opened the door, and he had followed Mr. Summerly's example as re gards his undignified mode of entrance, was abrupt and to the point. \" I came to see Miss Bannerleigh,\" he said. \"Third floor, sir,\" said Rose in surprise, mentally noting that Miss Bannerleigh's father and Miss Banner leigh's friend were not of this calibre. For a moment he looked doubtfully at the mud on his boots, and then at Rose's begrimed counte nance. \" You are not particular about a little dirt here, are you ?\" he asked, an amused smile coming into his eyes. The girl rubbed her apron, with which she had just been wiping a moist dish, across her face, leaving"], [134, "126 MAXWELL LYNDERN. after the application a queer streak of shading down her cheek. \" No,\" she answered, \" it don't do to be too par ticular about anything ; there ain't time.\" \" You go first,\" he said ; \" I don't understand the way of these London houses.\" He tramped up-stairs after her, the sound of his heavy boots echoing through the house. At the door of Enid's sitting-room the girl hesi- tated. \" She's mighty cut up and quiet now,\" she said, with an instinctive feeling that her companion would jar on Enid's overwrought nerves without some slight toning down. \" You will not startle her, poor thing !\" He turned and looked at her with dumb surprise in his face ; then something else came into his eyes. It was the great soul of the man, full of pity and courage, full of gentleness and strength, of patience and calm self-sacrifice ; it was the flashing of the diamond, which as yet was totally unpolished, save for that one tiny speck. \"Here,\" he said, pushing half-a-crown into her hand. \" Now, say Maxwell Lyndem has come.\" She was sitting in her father's chair, with the fire light playing on her pale face and black dress. She struck Maxwell Lyndern as being some slight weak thing which must require a great deal of looking after and taking care of : he took in at a glance all her sur roundings \u2014 the deal table covered by the threadbare cloth, the rickety chairs, and small allowance of carpet"], [135, "MAXWELL LYNDERN. 127 across the hearth, the bare-boarded floor and the crack across the window-pane, even the broken jam-pot with a bunch of sweet fresh violets in it ; and then he looked back again at Enid, and said awkwardly, \" I have brought a letter from Mrs. Bannerleigh; I am Maxwell Lyndern.\" \"Will you sit down?\" she said, offering him her hand. As she had never heard his name before, the information did not much enlighten her. Now that she was standing before him, looking down upon her, he was more impressed than ever by her slightness and feebleness. Seeing his perplexity, she smiled, and hastened to reassure him. \"You bring a letter from my aunt,\" she said, look ing up at him; \" it was very kind of you to take so much trouble.\" \" It was no trouble,\" he answered. \" I was coming to town to sell some bullocks, and the missis \u2014 I mean Mrs. Bannerleigh \" \u2014 hastily correcting himself \u2014 \" said it would save time.\" He did not add that the good lady remarked it would save a penny also, although it would have been the literal truth ; and, considering a week had elapsed since she received Mr. Bannerleigh's letter, the latter consideration must certainly have been the weightier of the two. \" You know my aunt, of course ? She has a son, I believe \u2014 has not she ? They are quite strangers to me, you know,\" with another smile. \" Mrs. Bannerleigh has no son,\" he returned, still"], [136, "128 MAXWELL LYNDERN. nervously ; \" she married a widower with one son \u2014 in fact, she married my \u2014 my father before she married your uncle.\" \" 0,\" said Enid, the truth suddenly dawning upon her, \" I understand now !\" \"We got Mr. Bannerleigh's letter,\" continued Mr. Lyndern, rolling his hat round and round, and inflicting grievous, but unconscious, injury on the brim. \" Mrs. Bannerleigh and I hope you will look upon the farm as your home as long as you can be happy with us.\" \"You are very kind,\" said Enid gratefully. \"I have no friends but you and one other,\" in a low voice ; and then, looking up at him, the two great outward attractions he possessed struck her very forcibly \u2014 his eyes and his voice. \" The letter is here,\" he said, fumbling in bis pocket. \" I have not seen it ; I hope it is kind, and will show the welcome we wish to give you.\" To a sensitive recipient the letter certainly needed an apology, as Maxwell Lyndern shrewdly suspected. In the first place, it was written on what had once been the wrapper of a medicine bottle, economically pre served. It began thus : \" Dear Niece, \u2014 Your father's letter reached me a few days ago ; as he said it would be sent after his death, I conclude he is buried by now.\" Tears came into Enid's eyes at the rough handling of her wound. Maxwell Lyndern started at the si\u00b0ht of them, and bit his lip."], [137, "MAXWELL LYNDERN. 129 \" Confound her !\" he said, below his breath. \"And, therefore,\" went on the letter, \"you may as well come back with Max ; it will save sending the horse to the station twice. I may as well tell you we are very poor people, and if you come here you must do like the rest of us. Your father says you will be rich some day. I am glad to hear it, but I hope you have enough to keep yourself now, or it is no use coming here. I cannot afford to take jon for less than thirty shillings a week ; it is not much to pay for home comforts. You know how much good the coun try air will do you, and your father so much wished you to come. I shall quite expect you with Max ; and, you see, with so many advantages, thirty shillings a week is not much. \u2014 Your affectionate aunt, \" Jane Bannerleigh.\" At any other time Enid would have smiled at this very original epistle, in which the writer's sentiments were stated in such undisguised terms, but now she only saw very plainly she was going to cast her lot with uncongenial grasping people, who could neither love nor understand her. But it did not trouble her \u2014 nothing troubled her now ; she had passed the great borderland which divides joy and sorrow from calm indifference, or she thought so then. \"I can pay you the sum Mrs. Bannerleigh re quires,\" said Enid, without looking up. \" The what ?\" demanded Max, with a frown. K"], [138, "130 MAXWELL LYNDERN. \"The money she requires for my board and lodg ing,\" explained Enid, with a faint smile at the recol lection of Mrs. Bannerleigh's delicate mode of express- ing herself. \" She has lost no time,\" said her companion bit terly. \" Perhaps it is as well you should understand the kind of woman she is at once ; but if she dares to touch a farthing of your money \u2014 \" with a dark look in his eyes. \"It is quite right,\" said Enid hastily. \" I could not think of taking advantage of your hospitality with out making what small return is in my power. I have no claim on any one, you know.\" But she mentally noted that this big fellow with the mud on his boots was not quite the kind of person she had fancied. \" You are very proud,\" he said, in a low voice. \" Your principle of only taking where you give will suit Mrs. Bannerleigh.\" Instinctively she knew she had grievously wounded him ; he meant to be generous, and his generosity had received a check. \"You must not think me ungrateful for your kind ness,\" she hastened to say ; \" indeed, I appreciate and value it very much ; but I want you to understand \u2014 \" He rose. \" It does not matter,\" he said ; \" the missis will quite understand. Shall you be ready to go back with me to-morrow ?\" \" Yes,\" she answered, \" I shall be quite ready.'' ' I will call for you at half-past one. Good-bye.\""], [139, "131 MAXWELL LYNDERN. \"Thank you. Good-bye.\" She held out her hand to him, and her eyes sought his face with a look of appeal in them. She knew in spite of his rough exterior he was sensitive, and she had hurt him. He did not look at her until she bade him farewell ; then the small soft hand lying in his big brown one seemed suddenly to remind him of all her weakness and all her helplessness, the bitter, disappointed look faded out of bis face, and he smiled. \" Can I do anything for you ?\" he asked. \" No, thank you,\" she answered, turning away her head ; \" he was buried yesterday.\" Without another word he dropped her* hand and left her. She could hear his heavy footfall as he tramped down-stairs, and then the front door closed with a bang. On the table lay Mrs. Bannerleigh's letter, but Enid did not read it again : she sat down on the chair by the fire and mused. \"What an extraordinary man!\" she said reflec tively : \"he looks so rough and unpolished, and yet his voice is more soft and gentle than any I ever heard; and his eyes are like a bloodhound's, sometimes fierce, some times intensely pathetic, and I don't believe he knows they are either one or the other. Yes, Maxwell Lyndern is a very extraordinary man.\""], [140, "CHAPTER XIV. \" HE IS A GENTLEMAN \" \" So your relations have appeared upon the scene at last,\" said Mr. Summerly : \" tell me what this Mr. Lyndern is like.\" He had just dropped in at 48 Ghoul's Buildings to see how Enid was getting on, and bring her some more violets. He found her sitting in her old place by the fire, with the same thoughtful look on her face as it wore when Mr. Lyndern left her. \" I don't think I can describe him,\" she said, with a smile : \" he appears to me a mass of contradictions.\" \" That sounds somewhat perplexing,\" he returned, \" Perhaps after a little further study of his character you will put him into your next book, then my curiosity will be satisfied.\" \" No,\" she said, shaking her head, \" I do not think I shall do that; I should be so horribly afraid he might find it out.\" \" Is he, then, so alarming or grotesque as to make the drawing unmistakable ?\" \" No, not that, but he is sensitive.\" \" And a mass of contradictions, you said ; therefore he must be the reverse also ?\" \" He looks like a cattle-drover,\" she answered, \"and he is a gentleman.\" \" A rather unusual combination.\" \" Yes, he is an unusual man.\""], [141, "HE IS A GENTLEMAN. 133 \"From a professional point of view, a study.\" \" Yes, a study.\" \" And you really leave London to-morrow ! In one respect I resemble your Mr. Lyndern : I am a contra diction of myself in the matter of being glad and sorry about the same circumstance.\" \" You are very kind,\" she said, \" you have been more than kind all through.\" \"No one could have done less than I have. I should like to come and see you off to-morrow if I may ; you might want a man's help at the last.\" \" Mr. Lyndern is coming for me, thank you all the same ; but there is no need to trouble you.\" \" It would give me pleasure,\" he answered, without showing the slightest gleam of the disappointment he felt. \" But if you would rather I did not \u2014 \" Suddenly she turned her face to him with tears in her eyes. \" You said on that day you understood me,\" she said, in a very unsteady voice. \" When I leave here to-morrow I leave the last association of papa ; I leave the last place I have a right to call home, and the only people who, after the best of their ability, have been good to me. If I were to leave my best and kindest friend at the same time, I think it would, perhaps, be too much for me.\" There was silence. Mr. Summerly stretched out his hand towards the bunch of violets on the table, and as he passed it over them it trembled. As soon as he could command his voice he spoke."], [142, "134 HE IS A GENTLEMAN. \" Do you think it possible you will ever care enough for any one to marry?\" he asked. \" No,\" she answered, \" I shall never marry.\" His hand fell on the table behind the violets, otherwise he did not move. \" Your novel gave me the impression that you cared for some one very much once : I have often won dered if it was a right impression.\" \" Have you ?\" she asked, without suspecting the vital importance of her answer to the man beside her. \" If I really cared for any one, I should care for him always ; you know what Tennyson says about ' the tears which flow but once a life.' I have always felt those words applied very forcibly to mine.\" \"You think you will never care again?\" he said, with a break in his voice. \" I know I never shall in that way.\" He rose and went to the window. \" How plainly you can hear the Abbey clock from here?\" he said; \"I was wondering if you can see it too.\" \" No, you cannot see it.\" He did not move from the window. \"If you will give or send me your address, I will let you have the first lot of proofs for correction as soon as possible.\" \" Thank you.\" \"You will tell me what your new home is like,\" he continued, to gain time before he looked at her again. \"I shall be immensely interested in all your surroundings.\""], [143, "135 HE IS A GENTLEMAN. \" I will send you the best description of which my pen is capable.\" \" Then I have something very pleasant to look forward to.\" He turned slowly and came towards her. \" If you are quite sure I can be of no further use to you, I think I must say good-bye.\" His voice was perfectly under control now \u2014 very kind, very friendly, with the old easy pleasant ring in it. \" I am quite sure,\" she answered. \" Good-bye,\" he said, looking steadily into her eyes. \" Will you remember that the big brother is at hand when he is wanted, and that he always will be?\" She nodded, she could not trust herself to speak. \"I hope the country air will make you strong and well again, and that you will have a pleasant journey.\" Those were the last words he said to her ; raising her hand to his lips, he kissed it and left her. He had made the farewell as easy as he could for her, as little like one as possible. As he drove away he knew he had paid his last visit to Ghoul's Buildings ; probably he would never see the shabby little room again, never stumble up the narrow staircase. The chances were, he would never see Enid either. It had been a pleasant dream, now passed out of his life, and one from the recollection of which he must arouse himself. \"It was too pleasant to last long,\" he mused; \" pleasant things are like the sunshine and the flowers, they soon fade.\""], [144, "CHAPTER XV \" IN THE FENS \" At half-past one to a minute, Mr. Lyndern ap peared. Enid was dressed and waiting for him, and the box which contained her worldly goods standing ready strapped in the passage. A change had taken place in Maxwell Lyndern, both internally and externally, since the day before. The mud had been removed from his boots, and his bands were clean ; his hat and coat, however, were still suggestive of the farm-yard, and pervaded with the odour of tobacco. To Enid his manner was constrained and formal, but not ungentle ; to every one else he was almost rough, and seemed with a dogged persistency to endeavour to make the very worst of himself. There was an air of defiance about him, the certain knowledge that this being, who, in spite of her surroundings, was essentially of another world from his own, and must inwardly despise him, gave him a fierce desire to show her that he fully recognised how vast the gulf which divided them really was. Most women would have shurnk from him ; but Enid, with her keen observation of men and things, only felt a sort of compassion, seeing through the veil of roughness which so thinly covered the sensitive nature beneath. His greeting was cold : he did not look at her, and purposely avoided taking her hand."], [145, "IN THE FENS. 137 \" I have brought a cab, if you are ready,\" was all he said, and then he turned to Rose. \" Where is the luggage ?\" he demanded sharply. \"Here, sir,\" answered Rose, drying her tears on the corner of her apron, and starting at the change in his voice. \" I will take it down, sir.\" \"Get out of the way,\" he said, in the same tone; \" carrying boxes about is not woman's work.\" He picked up the box as if it weighed about a pound and a half. \" I am afraid you will find it heavy,\" said Enid, turning to him ; \" there are some books in it.\" \"Are there ?\" he observed carelessly; \" you need not have troubled yourself with those ; we have plenty at home, I think.\" \" Have you ?\" she returned. \" I am so glad ; but these are a few old friends I could not be happy without.\" \" 0, it does not matter,\" he said quickly; \" there is plenty of room for them.\" And then, with the box on his broad shoulder, he went down-stairs, she following. While she was saying farewell to Rose and Mrs. Sims, he stood holding the cab-door open for her. \"Are you not coming?\" she asked in surprise, as he closed it. \"No,\" he answered abruptly; \"I am going on the box.\" With dim eyes and beating heart Enid looked her last on the miserable street, which a short time"], [146, "138 IN THE FENS. ago held all that she could call her own on earth ; and then leaning back, and shutting her eyes, she thought of the past as her only possession, not caring in the faintest degree what the future had in store for her. 0, how those wretched cabs rattle and jolt one ! how the din of the great city distracts one, on and on through the restless streets, where toil, sorrow, starvation, luxury, and riches seem so queerly blended ! The cab stopped, and Maxwell Lyndern jumped off the box. \" There is plenty of time,\" he said, taking her rug and umbrella; \" if you will go to the waiting-room out of the cold, I will get your ticket and see after the luggage.\" \" Thank you,\" assented Enid, feeling, in spite of his distant manner and rough exterior, a sort of com fortable security in having this great strong man to look after her. Meekly obeying him, she went to the fire and waited until he came to fetch her, and then followed him down the platform. At the open door of a first class carriage he stopped. \" Will you get in ?\" he said. \" I thought we were going third class,\" she ob served, looking up at him, and remembering Mrs. Ban nerleigh's cry of poverty and her own slender resources. \" You will have quite enough cold and discomfort to contend with at the end of our journey, without beginning either before it is necessary. There is a"], [147, "139 IN THE FENS. drive of nino miles between the station and the farm.\" \" But I do not mind roughing it,\" remonstrated Enid, with a smile; \" indeed, I am used to being out in all weathers, and \" \u2014 hesitating \u2014 \" it is so expensive travelling first-class.\" \" No, it is not,\" he answered; \" won't you get in ?\" He spoke much as one would to a child when one has determined upon the course it is to pursue. Then, with the apparent contradiction of his nature, he wrapped the rug round her almost clumsily, the result of his extreme nervousness. \" The foot-warmer is quite hot,\" he said, not looking at her; \"I hope you will be comfortable.\" Suddenly diving into one of his pockets, and producing Punch, the Standard, the War Cry, and Church Bells \u2014 literature chosen with a delightful impartiality to both politics and religion, and displaying his complete ig norance of the views of the recipient \u2014 \"Here are some papers ; I thought they might amuse you ; I believe you said you liked books and those kind of things.\" \"How good of you to think of it !\" she returned, smiling. \" I shall come and see how you are getting on when we make a stop.\" \" Are you not coming with me ?\" she asked in surprise. \"I don't look much like a first-class passenger,\" he answered bitterly; \"I always travel third;\" and, with out looking back, he left her."], [148, "140 IN THE FENS. All through the journey his manner continued the same: always gentle and considerate; firm in all that con cerned her comfort ; nervous in performing the smallest act of personal attention, which involved his touching or looking at her ; never for one moment forgetting or letting her forget the immeasurable distance between them. Indeed, with each act of kindness the distance seemed greater ; he wished it to be so, because then, without being misunderstood, he could be kinder. Yet what a terribly long journey it was, in spite of all his efforts to make it as bearable as possible ! At eight o'clock it came to an end. The station at Fag End looked singularly bleak and dreary, lighted by a wretched lamp at each end of the platform. There was a small waiting-room, the furniture of which consisted of a table and one chair; the fireplace was very small and the fire always smoked. Then there was a room which smelt very strong of lamp-oil, and the booking-office, where the stationmaster consoled himself as best he could during the monotonous hours of duty. A truck or two stood in the siding, on which reposed sacks and a few other miscellaneous articles. \" Fag End, Fag End !\" sleepily drawled a blue-nosed porter, slowly emerging from the booking-office. Almost before the train stopped, Maxwell Lyndern was at the carriage-door. \" We get out here,\" he said, offering Enid his hand; \" take care, it is very dark \u2014 can you see the step ?\" \" Yes, thank you,\" she answered, putting her hand in his and jumping out."], [149, "141 IN THE FENS. \" There is a box in the van,\" he continued, turning to the porter; \"get it out.\" The man touched his cap and moved more quickly. There were no other passengers for Fag End, so Enid and her companion found themselves standing on the platform alone with the porter. \" Come to the fire,\" said Lyndern, leading the way to the booking-office : \" it is the only one at which you can get warm ; these fellows have an excellent idea of taking care of themselves.\" How the wind whistled and moaned ! the very sound of it made Enid shudder. Before the fire sat a remarkable specimen of humanity, in the shape of an old man, clad in a rough coat, the hue of which was bottle-green ; his legs were enveloped in straw buskins, round his shoulders was an old sack, and on his head a fur cap, tied over the ears with a piece of twine, and beneath which his gray hair appeared in a fringe. A short black pipe was between his lips, and he sat blinking at the fire like an ancient specimen of the feline tribe, only omitting the purr of satisfaction in which those animals generally indulge. \" Here, old John, wake up !\" cried Maxwell Lyndern sharply; \"where the dev \u2014 where is the horse?\" hastily correcting himself. The remarkable specimen simply grunted, slowly turned bis head, and scrambled to his feet. \"Come, look alive; where's the horse, I say?\" demanded bis master again."], [150, "142 IN THE FENS. \" The erse,\" returned the old man contemptuously, \" is where he ought to be. You don't think I kep the erse awaiting in this bitter wind for yow, do yow ? Yah !\" It was a much longer speech than old John usually favoured either his master or any one else with. As he shuffled off, Maxwell Lyndern looked amusedly after him. \" Queer old devil,\" he said below his breath ; then turning to Enid, \" Are you very tired ?\" \" Not very,\" she answered. \" You will think us a queer lot,\" said Max, moodily regarding the fire. \"I think, perhaps, old John is the queerest of us all ; he has a supreme contempt for humanity generally, including myself, and he takes no trouble to disguise it. My horse and dog are the only living things he cares for ; many a night I have known him sleep in the stable because he fancied Quicksilver was out of sorts or done up.\" Without waiting for any reply be disappeared through the open door into the bitter cold and now fast-falling snow. From time to time she heard his voice loudly calling to old John to \"look alive,\" with other observations of a like nature, interspersed by somewhat unparliamentary expressions at the delay. At length the sound of wheels fell on her ear, and then Max returned with a bundle of shawls and rugs on his arm."], [151, "143 IN THE FENS. \" It is snowing fast,\" he said, shaking the white flakes off his coat ; \" you must be well wrapped up.\" As he spoke he put a shawl round her with clumsy gentleness, but he did not look at her ; he was angry with himself for having stepped over the barrier, even for that brief moment when he talked to her as he would have talked to an equal. He lifted her into the high dog-cart, and shouted to old John to climb up behind; then springing in himself, he took the reins in his hand, leaving the whip in the socket. \"Hey up now, my beauty !\" he cried. At the sound of his voice the horse plunged forward, and then, knowing so well the hand that guided him, set off in magnificent form. For five miles the pace continued undiminished. It was pitch dark save for the lamps on the vehicle, and by their light Enid could see nothing but wide ditches on either side. Suddenly they went into a big cart-rut, which all but jolted her out of her seat. \"Hey, master !\" grunted old John, who, having fallen asleep, resented this untimely interruption to his slumbers. \" Are you very cold ?\" suddenly asked Max, bending down towards the girl beside him. It was the first observation he had made since they left Fag End ; it was the last until they arrived at the farm. For the remaining four miles the road was almost impassable : in some places they had to drive on a"], [152, "144 WHERE'S THE MASTER? bank to avoid the drains and dykes, at others old John climbed down and led Quicksilver over the ruts, which to an inexperienced driver made the road full of peril. Maxwell Lyndern, who knew every inch of it, did not disregard this precaution. CHAPTER XVI. \"where's the master?\" At a happier time in her life Enid would have felt a wholesome distrust of her position, and an undisguised desire to arrive at her destination, mingled with dire apprehension as to the kind of destination it would be ; but in her present frame of mind the adventure enter tained and amused her ; the peril, which she in her ignorance greatly exaggerated, touched the vein of romance in her nature, and, caring so little what became of her life, it simply aroused and amused her to risk it. At length, after numerous shakings and joltings, Max drew rein. Old John scrambled down for the last time, and, going to the horse's head, muttered in a weird uncanny way as he caressed him, taking no notice whatever of the master. Just as he lifted Enid into the dog-cart Max lifted her out. Old John produced a broken lantern with a farthing candle in it, and Max, taking possession of it with one hand and guiding Enid over the loose stones"], [153, "where's the master? 145 with the other, they approached a low thatched farm house, at the door of which stood a woman in a short serge gown. It did not cover her ankles, and her arms were bare from the elbow. A snow-white apron reached to the bottom of her gown, and a cap, equally spotless and tied tightly under her chin, completed her costume. \"Well, Hannah!\" said Max. \"Well, master!\" returned Hannah. There was a vagueness about this mode of address which struck Enid curiously. She seemed to have come among people of a different nation and language from her own. \" Unfasten Miss Bannerleigh's shawl, and take her to the fire,\" said Max. \"Where is the missis?\" \"Arter her own ways,\" returned Hannah, leading Enid into the low kitchen, lighted by the fire and a candle, own brother to the one in the lantern. From the sanded floor and table to the tin cooking utensils hanging from the plate-range, everything was scrupulously clean ; from the cat purring on the hearth to the clock ticking against the wall, everything was, after its own fashion, undeniably comfortable. Having delivered his charge over to the tender mercies of Hannah, Max gave a sigh of relief, and dis appeared. \"Yow have come a good step, mebbe,\" observed Hannah. \"Yes,\" returned Enid, concluding, after a pause, that her companion meant a long distance. \" Shrammed o' cold, mebbe,\" taking the girl's hand L"], [154, "146 where's the master? in hers ; then, suddenly leaving her, she put some boiling water from the kettle singing by the fire into a jug. \" You have no call to tell the missis,\" she said, looking sharply round ; \" she's after saying hot water wastes the soap. Come along o' me, my hearty.\" Enid followed her along- a dark passage, and up a flight of uncarpeted stairs. At the door of a room they stopped ; Hannah pushed it open, and went in first. It was a long low room ; the ceiling sloped after the fashion of attic ceilings, and showed that this apart ment was next the roof. Over the window, the door, and round the bed hung red curtains ; on the walls were a few pencil sketches, hopelessly out of drawing, and with a modest disregard of any attempt at imi tating the copy from which they were supposed to be taken. \" There ain't no fire here,\" observed Hannah, in some disgust \u2014 \" not a mite, bless you ! She \" \u2014 with a contemptuous and expressive gesture of her thumb over her shoulder \u2014 \" she jawed me for half an hour about wasting the coal and kindling. You must pay no heed to her, if you mean to get on here ; no more heed than I do.\" Evidently, from the force of the comparison, Hannah felt that no state of indifference could be more complete than her own. Without waiting for comment or reply to her last statement, she left the room, and in a few moments returned, carrying Enid's box with nearly as much ease as Max had carried it."], [155, "where's the master? 147 \" She's that near,\" said the woman, kneeling down and unfastening the strap, regardless of the interrup tion to her remarks which fetching the box had occa sioned \u2014 \" she's that near, she would skin a flint if she could sell the skin. You're hungry, I'll be bound ; but she'll sit there and grudge every bit of vittles as goes into your mouth. That's why I say, don't pay no heed to her.\" With this last piece of gratuitous advice, the woman rose from her knees and looked at her companion. \" Thank you for all your help and kind advice too,\" said Enid. \" I am sure I shall get on very well. As to being hungry, you must not trouble about that. Mr. Lyndern looked after me most kindly during the journey. I had all I could possibly want.\" A change came over Hannah's face ; the hard out lines softened, and her eyes lit up strangely. \" Max Lyndern is different,\" she said, and turned away her head. By this time Enid was ready to accompany her companion down-stairs again. Hannah still leading the way, they came to an archway and three stone steps ; then down another passage, at the end of which a door stood open. Through it came the sound of a squeaky querulous voice. \"You will ruin me, I know you will, all the lot of you ; that is what you are driving at. Send me to the workhouse, take the bread out of my mouth, starve me \u25a0starve me ; that's what you are after !\" \" How can I see what is upon the table if there is"], [156, "148 where's the master? no light ?\" returned Max in patient tones, but with the old firm ring in his voice. \" There is the fire ; that gives light enough now you have emptied the coal-scuttle on it \u2014 it ought to, it ought to.\" \" The fire was nearly out, and the room like a well, when I came in,\" said Max composedly, lighting two candles as he spoke. Without either hesitation or permission, Hannah stirred the fire into a blaze, and Enid, still following her, saw for the first time the woman whom, from the sound of her voice, she expected to find decrepit and almost helpless. When, instead, she saw a wiry old lady standing by the chimney-piece, as straight as Max himself, she gave a little start of surprise. Mrs. Bannerleigh had very prominent features, a big nose, and high cheek-bones, over which the skin seemed drawn with painful tightness ; her eyes had a wild suspicious look in them, never resting on one object for more than a second. When she was not speaking, she was perpetually listening, listening, as if at any moment some sound which she dreaded might fall on her ear. She took Enid's hands in her bony claw. \" You got my letter?\" she said anxiously; \"Max gave you the letter?\" \" Yes,\" answered Enid, knowing full well the drift of her question. \"I am much obliged to you for receiving me.\" She would have put the old creature's mind at rest without delay, but a vivid recollection of"], [157, "where's the master? 149 the way her reference to pecuniary arrangements dis tressed Max before restrained her. Mrs. Bannerleigh looked nervously at her stepson, who was standing with his back to them in the sha dows ; then, drawing Enid unpleasantly close to her, she whispered hoarsely, \" And the money \u2014 the money !\" She was literally shaking with anxiety. \" Yes, I will pay you all you ask,\" returned the girl, her eyes following those of her relative and rest ing on Max. He started slightly and half turned his head, but otherwise showed no sign of having heard the conversa tion. Then he walked to the table, on which a meal for two persons was prepared ; it consisted of a piece of cheese, some butter, and a bread-loaf. \"Is this all?\" he asked, regarding the frugal re past with disgust and dismay. \"I ordered supper to be ready. Hannah \u2014 where is Hannah ?\" A rather vigorous nudge from that person's elbow acquainted him with her nearness. \" There, that will do,\" she said sharply, and with the impatience of a privileged domestic. \" There's a fine row up in the rafters this night, missis. I often fancy I hear a man tramping about up aloft, but I never fancied it more plain than to-night.\" \"A thief! a robber!\" cried the old woman, with absolute horror in her wild eyes. \" Here, let me go, let me go !\" Then, suddenly changing her tone with a great effort \u2014 \" What should a thief want here ? We"], [158, "150 where's the master? are poor, desperately poor ; there is nothing to steal \u2014 nothing, nothing !\" As she spoke she disappeared, almost running up the stairs, and muttering distractedly to herself, \" Nothing, nothing !\" Without a word, Hannah left the room after her. Enid went up to Max. \" She is afraid,\" she said. \" Will you not go after her ?\" There was something piteous in the old creature's terror. He turned his head, and looked down at the girl beside him. \"You do not understand,\" he said: \" she is always fancying people will rob her ; day after day, hour after hour, it is the same. We take no notice of it; you must take no notice of it either.\" \"It is so dreadful to be frightened,\" said Enid appealingly, and laying her hand on his arm ; \"please go to her.\" Her touch affected him just as it had affected him all day. Without a moment's hesitation he obeyed her with the air of a man who was glad to escape from the room. This apartment, like the others, was scrupulously clean, but to some extent comfortless ; the horsehair chairs, with their stiff backs, looked uninviting; the sofa even more so, if possible ; the bookcase almost devoid of books, and filled with a miscellaneous collection of household necessaries."], [159, "where's the master? 151 Before Hannah's footfall sounded in the passage Enid had time to observe these details. With undisguised satisfaction the servant put before Mr. Lyndern's place a dish of eggs and bacon, and before Enid's an earthenware teapot, and then exclaimed abruptly, \"Where's the master?\" \" He has gone to Mrs. Bannerleigh,\" said Enid. \" She appeared so alarmed at what you said.\" A look of amazement overspread her face. \" Nonsense !\" she said; \" he knows better. That is how I always start her off after her money-bags ; she has been like that for the last twenty years. She would not thank him or any one else for going after her. Max Lyndern is not such a fool.\" \" It was my doing,\" said Enid : \" I asked him to go.\" Another change passed over her face : it wore a look of sorrowful conviction now. \"He went on what he knew was a fool's errand because you asked him, he went without a moment's hesitation.\" \"Yes, when I asked him,\" returned the girl gently. \"Ah!\" That one little word was her only comment, and having spoken it, she left the room."], [160, "CHAPTER XVII. THE FIRST STEP When Max returned, Enid went a step or two to meet him. \"I am afraid I did wrong in asking you to go after her,\" she said ; \" you mu3t forgive me for interfering. Tell me what she said.\" He looked at her and smiled. \" I told you we were a queer lot,\" was his only answer. \" Tell me what she said,\" repeated Enid. \" She thought the proceeding rather unusual, and expressed herself to that effect,\" he answered ; \" she told me to mind my own business, and not worry the life out of her : the rest would not entertain you.\" \" I am sorry I asked you to go,\" said Enid. \" You humoured me as you would a child when it makes a foolish request ; you must not spoil and give way to me. I shall learn better in time.\" \" Come and have something to eat,\" he said, placing a chair for her. Enid observed that he ate scarcely anythiug himself. Occasionally he spoke of the country around, but seemed glad when she took the conversation on her own shoulders, and his share was confined to monosyllabic replies. When the meal was over, Enid excused herself on the plea of fatigue."], [161, "153 THE FIRST STEP. \" If you will excuse me, I think I will say good night,\" she said, giving him her hand ; \" I feel tired.\" \" Good-night,\" he returned, scarcely touching it. \" We are early people in the morning, but you will get up just when you like. Please ask for anything you want. Hannah will do her best for you. I wish we could make it more comfortable, more like home.\" \"It is very comfortable,\" she answered, with more gratitude than truth. \" Good-night, Mr. Lyndern ; thank you very much for all your kindness.\" She left the room without waiting for a reply, and, obtaining a candle from Hannah, went slowly and wearily up-stairs. After she had gone, Max threw himself into the armchair and looked thoughtfully at the fire. He never stirred or raised his eyes during the time Hannah cleared the table. When she had folded the cloth, she stood watching him for a full minute in silence. \" Well!\" he said, arousing himself. \"Well!\" she repeated, just as she did when they met at the door. \" What have you to say now ?\" he asked. \" Nothing.\" The answer was short and to the point. \" Shall I make up the fire ?\" she inquired, after a pause. \" No, I will smoke in the kitchen to-night.\" \"Why?\" Again she spoke sharply."], [162, "154 THE FIRST STEP. \" What an odd question !\" he said evasively. \" Why should I not smoke in the kitchen?\" \"Because you never do.\" \" Some people object to the smell of stale smoke,\" turning his back to her and filling his pipe. \" So she has come between you and your comfort a-ready, has she ?\" said the woman. \"What did I say ? what did I say ?\" He did not answer, but followed her into the kitchen. On the hearth lay his dog. At the sound of his footfall the animal sprang up and ran towards him, licking his hand, and showing, in the best way at his disposal, his joy at his master's return. \"Ah, Wallace, old man,\" said Max, patting him, \" glad to see me back, are you ? Lie down sir, good dog, good dog !\" Hannah was packing up her work preparatory to going to bed. \" If you are not in a hurry, you might sit down for a little time,\" said Max; \"I have something to say to you.\" Without a word she complied. \" You see, now, you were mistaken,\" he said after a pause, and rather nervously : \" Miss Bannerleigh is not at all like what you expected.\" \" More's the pity.\" \" You are hard to please, Hannah.\" \" What I said before I say again,\" returned the woman : \" the day when that dead man's letter found its"], [163, "155 THE FIRST STEP. way into this house was a bad day for you. I said put Mr. Bannerleigh's letter in the fire, and leave Mr. Bannerleigh's daughter to the people she's used to : it is best for her and best for you.\" \" I told you before there w*as no alternative,\" said Max : \" she has not a single relation or friend in the world who would look after her. You have seen her for yourself : do you think it would be right to leave any one so young and beautiful to the mercy of strangers ? Even you would hesitate to disregard a dead man's entreaty so touchingly expressed.\" Looking into the fire, she shook her head slowly and mournfully from side to side. \" Remember,\" she said, \" I was always against it \u2014 always, from the first.\" \" I don't know why you should have been,\" observed Max, with some impatience. \" I told you no good would come of bringing a fine lady to such a place as this, with her London manners and her London ways. You know, no one better, tho state of these fen roads : it means that for six months in the year she will be a prisoner in the house, or else wring her ankles every step she takes ; you know how the marsh wind cuts one through and through, and takes the breath out of one. Then look at the missis, look at old John, look at me,\" with a hopeless ring of contempt in her voice. \" You are the only person for miles around she can turn to and make a companion of, and you know what that means : it means danger and trouble. I knew it when that dead man's"], [164, "156 THE FIRST STEP. letter came telling us of her beauty, and her cleverness, and her sweetness. I read the end of it in the begin ning, and I warned you. You would not listen, and now it is too late.\" A coal fell noisily out of the fire ; it disturbed Wallace sleeping at his master's feet, and, raising his head, the animal uttered a low growl. A shudder ran through Max, which shook him from head to foot. Hannah started and looked intently at him. \" Max Lyndern,\" she said solemnly, \" I have known you man and boy these thirty-three years ; I taught you to walk, and held you on your first pony when your legs were too short to reach the stirrups ; I have seen you out on these dreary marshes in the bitterest wind that ever chilled the marrow of one's bones ; I have seen you risk your life more than once, but never for all those thirty-three years have I seen you shudder like that.\" She rose, and mixing a glass of hot grog, set it beside him ; then, resuming her chair by the fire, she watched him as before. The wind howled dismally round the house, the clock ticked monotonously in the corner, the dog snoring on the hearth alone broke the silence for full five minutes ; then, suddenly arousing himself, Max spoke, more in answer to his own thoughts than his companion's words. \" The moment I saw her I knew your surmises had been wrong,\" he said, \" and that the danger you feared did not exist. She was not a fine lady, and she was"], [165, "157 THE FIRST STEP. not in the least likely to make a companion of me : the immeasurable gulf of birth, education, and refinement which divides us can never be bridged over. She comes from another world from ours, and she can never forget it any more than I can. If her beauty and her gentleness fail to touch our hearts, the sorrow she has had to bear must appeal to our sympathy. It is a dreary place to bring her to, but we will try our best to make her happy, always remembering that she is not one of us.\" \" Before you are a month older she will have taught you to forget it. There is not one woman in a thousand who could resist a temptation like that.\" \" I can never forget it for a second while I am with her.\" \" You are trying to narrow the gulf a-ready,\" said Hannah. \" Why did you smoke your pipe in the kitchen to-night instead of the parlour ? why did you put on your best clothes after a long tiring journey, instead of keeping your old ones on ? why did you sit down and play with your supper instead of eating it ? I am not blind ; the first step over the barrier has been taken this night, and you have taken it.\" He rose, laughing uneasily. \"You are a good soul, Hannah,\" he said, \"but you do not know everything. My only desire in making myself tolerably presentable was to disgust Miss Ban nerleigh as little as possible with her surroundings \u2014 that is the most we can strive after and hope for;\" he"], [166, "158 A LONG DAY. knocked the ashes out of his pipe as he spoke. \" Good night,\" he said, and left her. She watched his retreating figure, she listened to his footsteps as he went more softly up-stairs than was his wont, and then she threw her apron over her head with a gesture of despair. CHAPTER XVIII. A LONG DAY When Enid opened her eyes, it was to find Hannah bending over her with a tray containing breakfast in her hand. \" Am I late ?\" asked the girl, rubbing her eyes ; \" I was so tired, I slept all night.\" \" A good job an' all, my hearty,\" returned Hannah ; \" there's nowt much to get up for here. I've brought you a bit o' breakfast ; mebbe you'll get it more com fortable if the missis ain't a-staring at you.\" She put the tray on the table and drew aside the window-curtains. \" How is Mr. Lyndern ?\" asked Enid. \" Was he very tired too ?\" She turned round sharply, and answered, in a contemptuous tone, \"Tired! the master's never tired; he was out by daybreak this morning, and he is out now. The"], [167, "159 A LONG DAY. master's a plain body like the rest of us ; it's only fine gentlemen as gets tired.\" Hannah's manner left no room for doubt that Max Lyndern, for some reason best known to herself, was an unpleasant subject of conversation. Enid hastened to change it. \" What time is it ?\" she asked. \" Nigh upon ten. \"At what time does Mrs. Bannerleigh usually breakfast ?\" \" Seven.' \" Will you call me in time for breakfast to-morrow morning, please ?\" \"Yes, if you like.\" \" Tell me something of this part of the country,\" said Enid ; \" I know little or nothing about it, and last night it was too dark to see anything.\" \" It's bleak and dreary,\" returned Hannah, looking out of the window; \"for mile upon mile there is little but bog and creek, and much of what remains is barren land. There's never a hill and scarce a tree \u2014 all ditches and dykes, dykes and ditches. When a high wind is blowing from the sea you can taste the salt upon your lips, and hear the sea-birds cry. Some of the master's property is miles away, some near by.\" \" I suppose you have a postal delivery once a day ?\" said Enid, in some dismay. \" That depends upon the weather and the state of the roads. I can remember the time when you had to fetch your letters when you wanted them.\""], [168, "160 A LONG DAY. \" From Fag End, I suppose ?\" \"Yes.\" \"Is there a church near here ?\" inquired Enid \" There's a wooden place better er four mile,\" re turned the woman, \" where they have what they call a mission service. The parson at Fag End wanted it, and the master put it up. Very few folks go; there ain't a house within a mile of it.\" \" Mr. Lyndern goes, I suppose ?\" \" Sometimes.\" Her answer was short and sharp ; the unpalatable subject of the master had, for the second time, found its way into the conversation. Apparently she did not intend to give it a third opportunity of doing so ; for, murmuring something about being \" after her work,\" she left the room. On looking out of her window, Enid found that in no way had Hannah exaggerated the barrenness of the country. It was an inexpressibly desolate prospect ; the road, with sloping banks (the earth or clay having been cut away on either side of it), was too narrow in places for two vehicles to pass each other. About a quarter of a mile further it widened, but continued as rough and uneven as ever. On going down-stairs, Enid found Mrs. Bannerleigh alone in the \"parlour.\" \" Here you are at last !\" was her greeting, in a complaining tone of voice ; \" how late you are ! I have been listening for you for hours.\""], [169, "161 A LONG DAY. \"I am very sorry,\" said Enid apologetically; \" I over slept myself.\" \"It does not matter, it does not matter,\" returned Mrs. Bannerleigh ; \" sit down, now you have come, and talk.\" Enid complied. \" It's a happy home,\" said the old woman, in a fawning tone, \" every luxury and every comfort we poor people can provide. You will not forget the thirty shillings a week, my dear ?\" \"I will pay it in advance,\" said Enid, producing her purse. \" Yes, yes, that will be best,\" cried the old woman, eagerly clutching the money, and holding it in her clenched hand. \"I always said that would be best. Don't tell Max I took it, or her,\" nodding towards the kitchen. \" No, \"returned Enid, feeling a sort of horror creep ing over her at the old creature's greed. \" How do you make money, my dear?\" asked Mrs. Bannerleigh. \" Your father said you were clever, and could make money. Ah, that is clever ! that is clever!\" \"I write books,\" answered Enid. \" And people buy them and read them ?\" \" I have sold one, and the gentleman who bought it has promised to buy another, when it is finished.\" \"Why don't you get it finished?\" cried Mrs. Ban nerleigh ; \"I would work night and day for the beauti ful golden sovereigns.\" Then checking herseF, \" If you were as poor as I am, you would not waste time when it means money.\" M"], [170, "162 A LONG DAY. \"lam poor,\" returned Enid ; \" I depend entirely on my pen for all I have.\" \" Can't you write at once, to-day ?\" inquired Mrs. Bannerleigh, with a delightful ignorance of the impos sibility of writing to order. Enid smiled. \" Not to-day, I think ; I am not quite in the frame of mind for work. I want to get my nerves quiet, and read a little first.\" \" What a dreadful waste of time !\" she said, rocking herself backwards and forwards ; \" and time is money \u25a0 \u2014 time is precious.\" \" I want some exercise and fresh air,\" said Enid. \" I think I will go out.\" The presence of this woman was revolting to her, and the very thing Mrs. Banner leigh urged \u2014 viz. literary work \u2014 seemed, the longer she remained with her, the most impossible occupation that could have been suggested. As she left the room the voice of the miser followed her. Enid could hear her kissing the money in her hand. \" Ah! my beauties, my darlings !\" she muttered; \"how you flash \u2014 how you dazzle me !\" Max did not come home to dinner, so Enid and her amiable relative partook of that meal together. It would have been almost unbearable but for Hannah, who came constantly in and out ; but in spite of that, Mrs. Bannerleigh contrived to show Enid how plainly she grudged every mouthful she swallowed, which resulted in her leaving the table hungry. \" I am going out again,\" she said, joining Hannah in the kitchen. \"I want some more fresh air.\""], [171, "A LONG DAY. 163 There was a look on her face which went to the servant's heart. When she reached the door she turned and came back. \" When will Mr. Lyndern be home ?\" she asked. \" This evening.\" \" At what time ?\" \" How can I tell ?\" \" Four, five, six \u2014 which hour is the most probable ?\" Enid persisted. \"Mebbe one \u2014 mebbe t'other.\" She turned her beautiful, sorrowful eyes on the woman, and made a last appeal. \"He was so kind to me yesterday,\" she said; \"it seems so long since I saw him.\" \" I'll be bound he's not far off now/' answered Hannah. \" Take the dog with you and go for a walk.\" Without another word she obeyed. Hannah stood at the door looking after her. \" What did I say ?\" she cried, \" what did I say ?\" An hour passed, and then Mrs. Bannerleigh joined her servant in the kitchen. Hannah, who was sewing, looked up. \" I found some egg-shells in the cinder-bin this morning,\" said the old woman complainingly. \"Who had eggs last night, at twopence each ?\" \"Them as has a right to 'um,\" answered Hannah shortly. \" It's wicked, sinful waste,\" cried her mistress : \" it means ruin to us all, that's what it means.\" \"What does Miss Bannerleigh pay you for her"], [172, "164 A LONG DAY. board ?\" inquired Hannah, with the calm assurance of having the old woman completely under her thumb. \" Who said she paid me anything ?\" \" I say so. I know you would not have her here for nothing.\" \" She does not pay half what she costs,\" returned Mrs. Bannerleigh, half crying. \" That's a good thing,\" said Hannah, \" because as she certainly won't stop above a week, you won't miss the money when she's gone.\" \" Miss the money ! Good Lord, what do you mean ? She is not going ! you don't mean that !\" \" There ain't no mistake but what she will, if you don't let her have enough to eat, poor thing,\" returned Hannah ; \" you can't expect her to pay to be starved.\" \" She eats all she wants,\" retorted the old woman, really crying now at the prospect of being deprived of the money. \" She is hungry now,\" said Hannah : \" unless you behave different from what you did to-day, she will go-\" \" No, no, don't say that. I love her, I can't part with her. Perhaps if she gets money by her books she will pay more ; then she can live better.\" \"One of two things will happen,\" said Hannah triumphantly : \" either she will go, or she will fall ill and not be able to earn any money at all, and then you and the master will have to keep her for nothing.\" \" 0, what a wicked world it is !\" cried Mrs. Banner leigh, \" and you are the wickedest woman in it. Do"], [173, "A LONG DAY. 165 as you like \u2014 feed her on the fat of the land, and send me to the workhouse ; order the things yourself, do as you like, only for pity's sake don't let me see the waste !\" \"I'll take care the master's things ain't wasted,\" said Hannah ; \" you hold your tongue, and remember Miss Bannerleigh pays you for all she has, and the master provides it.\" This undeniably true statement of facts left nothing to be added, and this being the case, Mrs. Bannerleigh said no more, leaving Hannah master of the field. The day passed terribly slowly to poor Enid.' It required an education to walk at any pace over the marsh -land without coming to grievous harm and getting smothered with mud. Several times she sank ankle-deep in the treacherous bogs, and had some diffi culty in extricating herself. She quite longed to see Max ; he seemed the one person left to her who was in any way associated with her old life. She forgot that the first impression he made on her was rather an unfavourable one than otherwise ; she only remembered that yesterday he was kind, to-day he was absent, and she wanted him. After a time she returned to the house, it was so miserable out on the marshes alone. \"I will go to the stable and see old John,\" she thought ; \" perhaps he may know when Mr. Lyndern is coming home.\" The stable-door was partly open ; a horse stood in the stall. Enid went to the bars and looked in."], [174, "166 A LONG DAY. \" Quicksilver,\" she said, remembering the name by which Max spoke of it last night, and imitating his mode of address, \" hey up now, my beauty !\" At the sound of his name the animal turned his head. \"Come here,\" continued Enid, \" come, and let me stroke your nose.\" Thinking that a carrot was likely to be somewhere about his visitor, the horse obeyed. \" Here,\" said a gruff voice at Enid's side, \"you ain't a-going to balk him.\" The owner of the voice was old John himself. \" Gie him that 'ere ; the critter has had his fill, but he mayn't be balked,\" he said, thrusting an apple into her hand : \" you need not be a-feared on him, he's as gentle as a lamb.\" In spite of this reassuring advice from an indis putable source, most people in Enid's place would have felt some hesitation at allowing the horse to take a bite from the apple in her hand ; but all fear for herself was dead, she held it out unflinchingly towards him. \" Take care, for God's sake !\" cried Max, suddenly entering the stable. Enid noticed how pale he looked, and threw the remains of the apple into the manger, turning to him with a smile. \" I am so glad you have come,\" she said, holding out her hand ; \"it seems a very long time since I saw you.\" \"Thank you,\" he returned, partially recovering his colour ; \" I am not clean enough to shake hands with you. I hope the horse did not hurt you ?\""], [175, "167 A LONG DAY. \" 0 no ; he was as gentle as possible.\" \"You must not run the risk again,\" said Max; \" with the best intentions, he might hurt you.\" \" I thought perhaps I should hear when you were likely to return, if I came to the stable,\" she said, feel ing as if she bad found an old friend, and taking no pains to hide her pleasure at the circumstance. \" Did you ?\" he returned ; \" has it been a very long day ?\" \" The longest I ever spent, I think,\" answered Enid. \" I am extremely sorry. Has the missis been dis agreeable ?\" in an anxious tone. \" It is not that,\" she answered evasively. \" I ought not to have said what I did, but the pleasure of seeing you made the other part of the day appear dull by com parison.\" He tried to hide the effect her words had upon him ; he tried in his weakness to prop up the tottering barrier which she in her strength had all but broken down. \" She would not speak so openly to a man in her own station of life,\" he thought; \"but the difference being so great, reserve with me is as unnecessary as it would be in speaking to Hannah or old John ;\" and thinking this, he raised his eyes and looked at her. There was the same defiant recklessness in them now as there was yesterday, when he seemed so deter mined to make the worst of himself. \" I have ridden about thirty miles to-day,\" he said, looking at the mud on his boots and gaiters, and pur posely drawing her attention to the unattractiveness of"], [176, "168 Wallace's master. his appearance. \" I feel unfit to be in your presence. I must ask you to excuse me.\" He spoke respectfully and distantly, much as a stranger would speak to a superior. \" Shall you be very long ?\" asked Enid, determined to convince him that the only thing which prevented them from being friends was his persistent reserve. \" I have been looking forward all day to a nice long talk with j7ou.\" \"You will find my topics of conversation limited,\" he answered, interpreting her candour as before, \"and of the most uninteresting description ; I have no ideas beyond the farm.\" Feeling repulsed, and having no heart for making further efforts towards establishing a better understand ing, she turned away, and went indoors. CHAPTER XIX Wallace's master After Enid had changed her dress, she went down-stairs, taking Tennyson's poems in her hands. With them at least she would be able to pass a pleasant half-hour till tea-time. She had a faint hope she might find Max in the parlour, but it was tenantless ; so sitting down in the armchair by the fire, she turned to the book. It opened"], [177, "Wallace's master. 169 at a short poem, entitled \"Fatima;\" she had read it hundreds of times and knew it by heart. Beneath some of the passionate lines there was a pencil-mark drawn. Ah, how she had sobbed her heart out as her head rested on that very page, thinking of the man who had forsaken her, the man who had drifted so completely out of her life, yet was to her still a god among men in spite of everything ! She thought she would never see him again : her world and his were as far apart as if seas divided them. Yea, farther, for she knows certainly now that he never loved her ; it was only -pour passer le temps that he pretended to do so. It was impossible he could love her, she argues in his defence, in the mad unreasoning way in which she loved him. No, no ; that dream had come entirely to an end, and the passionate romance of her life was buried among the seaweed and coral beneath the restless sea. \" O love ! O fire ! once he drew With one long kiss my whole soul through My lips, as sunlight diinketh dew.\" She was still dreaming over the words when Max came in. The firelight alone illuminated the room. It rested on Enid's fair hair, with the golden lights in it; her fingers rested on the book which had recalled such painful thoughts and such intoxicating recollections of the dead past. As she sat there, unconscious of his presence, he remembered when he first saw her she was sitting thus, alone in her utter desolation, in the great city."], [178, "170 Wallace's master. He realised that this place, which was to him home, must be to her even more desolate than the other, for in it she seemed cut off from her world almost as completely as if she were dead. \"There were violets on the table on that day,\" he thought ; and, without making her aware of his pre sence, he quietly left the room. \" Hannah,\" he said, going into the kitchen, \" did I not see a little bunch of violets somewhere about here? I \u2014 I want them.\" \" They are there,\" she answered, pointing to the blue and white mug standing on the window-sill. \" I found them under the hedge this morning.\" He took them out of the mug, dried the stalks on his handkerchief, and called to his dog. \" Here, Wallace, old man,\" he said, \" come to me.\" Solemnly the dog followed him to the parlour-door. Max gave him the violets. \" Good dog,\" he said softly, and pointing to Enid ; \" drop them.\" With the violets in his mouth and an air of the most dignified importance, Wallace obeyed his master to the letter : he trotted up to Enid, laid them on her book, and then waited for the commendation which he felt he had so justly earned. \"You dear, clever old dog!\" she said, \"how did you find out I loved violets ?\" A faint blush came into her face and a smile parted her lips ; she stooped over the dog and kissed his head to hide both ; and then she fastened the violets in the bosom of her dress."], [179, "Wallace's master. 171 \"Wallace,\" she said, still caressing the dog, \"where is your master ? If you told him Enid wanted him to come and talk to her, do you think he would come ?\" Max, standing there in the shadow, heard every word. Enid wanted him. Not Miss Bannerleigh, not I, but Enid, the name by which he had never yet dared to call her even in his thoughts. \" Wallace's special talent does not lie in conveying intelligent messages,\" he said, coming forward. \" I am fortunate enough to be able to spare him the effort of trying.\" The blush on her cheek deepened. \" You do not sufficiently appreciate his powers,\" she said: \"he brought me a very kind message a minute ago.\" If Max had failed before to see the violets in her dress, he would have seen them now. If! But he had not. \" You like violets,\" he remarked, more to fill up an awkward pause than for any other reason. \" Yes,\" she answered, raising her eyes for a moment to his ; \" it was very kind of \u2014 Wallace to remember it and bring me some.\" She dropped her eyes again, hesitated a moment, and then rested her lips on the dog's head once more. \"Thank you, Wallace,\" she said. Like a prophecy the words of Hannah came into his mind : \"Before you are a month older she will have taught"], [180, "172 Wallace's master. you to forget it. There is not one woman in a thousand ivho could resist a temptation like that.\" And yet how his heart beat ! Why did she try so persistently to break down the barrier ? \"It was the dog she thanked, noi me,\" he told himself; \" she did not even know it was I who sent the violets. Hannah might have done it ; she would have acted in the same way if Hannah had.\" Knowing poor human nature in its many weak nesses, knowing the cheerless life stretching out before Enid, I cannot altogether blame her for yielding to the temptation of making this man just a little in love with her. She had literally no one to care for her, and he was very strong and gentle and kind : it would be pleasant to polish the diamond. She did not believe that any man could love deeply, certainly not deeply enough to be unhappy. Laurence Vanlyn had taught her that bitter lesson. \"You were reading, were not you?\" said Max, taking the chair opposite to her. \" That book is one of the old friends you brought with you, I suppose ?\" \"Yes,\" she answered; \"it is the dearest of them, I think, the one I could least do without.\" \" We have some books,\" he said, looking towards the few the bookcase contained. \"I do not remember what they are \u2014 I never read anything but the news paper.\" \" How do you manage to get through the evenings ?\" \" Smoking and thinking,\" he returned. The very thoroughness of the man prevented him"], [181, "Wallace's master. 173 from trying for one moment to appear other than he was, even though the admission would make her despise him a degree more than she must do already. \" You did not smoke last night,\" she said ; \" why was that ?\" \"I had a pipe in the kitchen before I went to bed.\" She knew quite well why he did not smoke in the sitting-room, and she smiled at the idea. \"Let us look at the books,\" she said; \" perhaps I may find them interesting.\" He lighted a candle and accompanied her to the bookcase. \"Shakespeare, Dante's Inferno, Soyer on Domestic Cookery, Holy Bible, Paradise Lost, The Life of De Quincy, a dilapidated song-book, a dozen card tricks for sixpence, and a hymn-book without a cover.\" She ran through the list, drawing her finger along the backs of the books as she did so. Then she turned and looked at Max. \" Shall we try the card tricks after tea ?\" she asked. Shall we ! Was the personal pronoun which put them on an equality once more used inadvertently or with that very object ? He answered the query as persistently as he answered all the others of a like nature \u2014 \" inadvertently.\" \" If you like,\" he assented. \" I am afraid I shall not be much help to you, but I will do my best.\" Mrs. Bannerleigh declined to have tea with them,"], [182, "174 Wallace's master. but remained in the kitchen, that she might not see the terrible extravagance of the meal. Enid wondered with some amusement what Mr. Summerly would think if he could see her calmly sitting down to a domestic tete-a-tete with the man she described to him as being like a cattle-drover. As Max sat opposite to her now in his brown tweed suit, with the lamplight across his face, she felt angry with herself for having so described him. \" What a horrible charge of snobbishness I am laying myself open to, when I acknowledge that a man's clothes can make the slightest difference to my estimate of him!\" she thought. After tea Mrs. Bannerleigh joined them. The rest less eyes were as restless as ever, she seemed still to be listening for the sound she dreaded, darning with scrupulous neatness some threadbare garment that it might last yet a little longer, and muttering over her work, taking no part in the conversation of her com panions. After a few minutes Enid left the room, and returned with Max's pipe in one hand and his tobacco-pouch in the other. Sitting down at the table, she proceeded to fill the pipe with great deliberation, and then handed it to Max and struck a light. \" I don't want to smoke,\" he said, watching her wonderingly as this new and unsuspected side of her character was revealed to him ; \" I would rather wait and have my pipe in the kitchen.\" She looked up and fixed her eyes on his ; then the"], [183, "Wallace's master. 175 very brightest smile he had ever seen on her face came into it. \" Do you want me to burn my fingers ?\" she asked half-mischievously ; \" the flame has almost reached them.\" For answer he took the match from her, and as he did so, accidentally touched her hand. The contact sent a thrill through him. She struck another match. \" You are sceptical as to my powers of filling a pipe properly,\" she said ; \" let me redeem my character and prove to you that you are mistaken.\" \" Some people dislike the smell of smoke very much,\" he said ; \" I think you do.\" \" You are wrong \u2014 I like it.\" Still he did not light his pipe. \"Let me wait,\" he said. \"I enjoy it,\" she affirmed, paying no heed to his protest ; \"if you will not smoke, I shall be reduced to doing so myself, and I do not contemplate the result of such a proceeding with confidence.\" Her light tone did not convince him. She glanced at the old woman sitting at the table, and back again at Max. \" What a sinful waste of matches !\" she said, and struck a third. Then the smile left her face. \"Mr. Lyndern,\" she said earnestly, \"do you wish to make me unhappy? do you wish to make me feel that my presence here is a restraint on you ? I have"], [184, "176 ENID, I UNDERSTAND YOU. told you the simple truth : if I ever had any absurd ideas of objecting to things, living for six months in Ghoul's Buildings would have effectually dispelled them. As a favour to me, will you smoke ?\" He answered by lighting his pipe. \" Thank you,\" said Enid. \" Now, shall we try the card tricks ?\" \" Yes,\" he answered, and sat down at the table. They had scarcely begun before Mrs. Bannerleigh rose and went to the match-box. \"Two hours ago I counted them, and there were seven, now there ave only four. 0 Lord ! 0 Lord ! what a terrible waste !\" CHAPTER XX. \" ENID, I UNDERSTAND YOU \" Enid settled down to her literary work in a way she would have thought scarcely possible a fortnight before. The absence of distracting surroundings, the monotony of her present life, prepared her mind in no small degree for work, and as a refuge from her own thoughts also it was welcome. One morning she re ceived a letter from Mr. Summerly, and the first instalment of proofs for correction. The letter ran as follows : \" My dear Miss Bannerleigh, \u2014 I was extremely glad to hear of your safe arrival, and entertained by the"], [185, "ENID, I UNDERSTAND YOU. 177 graphic description you gave of your new place of abode. It seems as incongruous to my mind to picture you living in the Fens as in Ghoul's Buildings. However, as this life of ours is made up of incongruities, I suppose I must get reconciled to the idea. I send you by this post the proofs ; let me have them back as soon as convenient. I also send, by rail, a box of books and periodicals, which may amuse you ; return them when you have quite done with them, and I will send you more. If at any time you feel a desire to communi cate with the civilised world, perhaps you will do me the honour of remembering I am eagerly waiting for a letter, and that the postman is quite at your disposal. Does the gentleman whose appearance you described as resembling that of a cattle-drover impiove on acquaint ance ? \u2014 Always most sincerely yours, \" Frederic Summerly.\" For obvious reasons Enid put this letter in the fire, and then she turned to Max. \"Mr. Summerly has sent me a box of books,\" she said; \"if you are sending to Fag End, perhaps old John might bring them back with him.\" \"I am going there myself this afternoon,\" he answered; \"I thought perhaps,\" hesitating, \"you might like a drive.\" \" How very kind of you to think of it !\" cried Enid gratefully ; \" I should enjoy it of all things.\" \"Do you like riding as well as driving?\" he asked. \" I have been thinking about getting a horse for you ; N"], [186, "178 ENID, I UNDERSTAND YOU. you would not be such a prisoner, then ; one can ride over these Fen roads, where walking and driving are both impossibilities.\" In spite of herself, the tears came into her eyes. She stooped over the old retriever to hide them, and put her arms round his neck. \" Wallace,\" she said unsteadily, \" go and tell your master he is a thousand times too good to me ; I don't think I have quite enough words at my disposal to tell him myself; perhaps you can make him under stand better than I.\" Finding himself released, the dog trotted off to his master, who was standing by the table. As Max stooped down and patted him, he felt Enid's tears still wet on his head. Suddenly his whole expression changed ; the restraint over himself which he had so persistently maintained left him ; in an instant he was beside her. \" What have I done ?\" he cried. \" What is the matter ? For God's sake, don't do that !\" His passion almost frightened her ; hitherto he had always been so calm, so serenely unmoved. \" It is nothing,\" she said, looking at him through a mist of tears. \" I am weak and foolish ; I have learned to bear sorrow philosophically, but kindness makes a baby of me. You have been more than kind to me from the first moment I saw you ; do not lay me under more obligations, which I can never repay.\" He moved a step or two back. \" Obligation to me ,'\" he said dully ; \" I never"], [187, "ENID, I UNDERSTAND YOU. 179 looked at it in that light. I have no right to offer you anything. Forgive me, and forget the act of pre sumption of which I have been guilty.\" \" Mr. Lyndern,\" she said, rising, and laying her hand on his arm, \"why will you persist in misunder standing me ? You must think me the most ungrate ful woman on this earth, if you believe what you have just said. I did not think a man lived who was so unselfishly good as you are, and it seems unfair to trespass on your generosity ; will you try to under stand me better for the future ?\" He did not move or raise his eyes from the hand lying on his sleeve. \" I am not good or generous,\" ho said, with parched dry lips, \" and I am not poor. I thought you might care to have what I should never miss ; there could be no obligation in accepting such a present.\" \" You refuse to accept even my gratitude,\" she said, smiling. \" There is one thing that would give me even more pleasure than the present ; can you guess what it is ?\" Slowly he raised his eyes ; they were more like a bloodhound's than ever, she thought, with that pathetic look in them. \"What is it?\" he asked. She put both her hands in his. \" To hear you say, ' Enid, I understand you.' She could feel his hands trembling ; and she knew her power over this man better than he knew it Jjjmself,"], [188, "180 A BUNCH OF POPPIES. \" Will you ?\" she said softly. \" It would make me very happy.\" \"Enid, I understand you.\" Never in her life had she heard her name so ten derly spoken ; not even Lawrence Vanlyn, accomplished in all the tones most calculated to reach a woman's heart, ever uttered it thus ; in his voice there was always a ring which came not from the true metal ; the counterfeit was almost perfect, but it was a coun terfeit all the same. It was the first time Maxwell Lyndern had called her by her Christian name, and it was the last for many weeks ; yet as she took her hands out of his, and turned away with a smile, he knew very surely that he had taken the second step over the barrier. In spite of himself, the tide was bearing him onward to \u2014 u-hat ? CHAPTER XXI. A BUNCH OF POPPIES Seed-time was past, summer dying, harvest had come ; harvest in all its ripe golden splendour, its gay garlands of wild flowers, and the song of a thousand birds joined together in one glad harmonious chorus. How I love harvest-time, and the first changing tints on the trees that come hand in hand with it !"], [189, "A BUNCH OF POPPIES. 181 0 autumn, you are so beautiful, my whole heart goes out to you and delights in you ! As Enid sat at the open window, her head resting on her hand and her eyes fixed on the MS. before her, she was thinking not of her work, but of the life which appeared at first so monotonous to her, the life that had become part of herself in these few months. Except on the rarest occasions, the wonder that it should be so never struck her \u2014 the wonder that she should have learned to be tolerably happy, so utterly cut off from all which she once considered so essential to happiness. The solution of the mystery lay in that one word ambition. The desire of her life was approaching its fulfilment ; the fame for which she had striven was almost within her grasp. Hour after hour she had read and written till the pages seemed engraved with letters of fire, and her brain reeled giddily as she mounted every fresh step of the golden ladder to the dizzy height beyond. A bowl of sweet white roses stood on the table ; the bees hummed drowsily ; the air was heavy with the perfume of flowers. A shadow came between Enid and the sunlight. She looked up with a start. \" Home already ?\" she exclaimed brightly ; \" that is refreshing.\" \" I want you to come for a ride,\" said Max. \" I came home on purpose to take you. You are sitting too closely at your work.\" He looked anxiously at her as he spoke."], [190, "182 A BUNCH OF POPPIES. \" Perhaps you are right,\" she said reluctantly. \" I get so absorbed in my work I forget all else. It was like you to think of it.\" \" Will you come ?\" he asked. \"To the cornfields? 0 yes; I am longing for a gallop,\" she returned. \" I am longing for a big handful of scarlet poppies. You farmers are a bar barous race of men not to appreciate them.\" \" You shall have as many poppies as you like,\" he returned, smiliug. \" I am unappreciative enough to bow to my fate with resignation if I never saw another. I hate them.\" Ah, how he thought of those words years afterwards, when the sight of the frail gaudy blossoms brought back to him such a flood of recollections, when a bunch of dead poppies was the only thing left to him ! \" Fleetfoot will be round in five minutes,\" he said. \" I ordered her to be saddled when I came home.\" \" Were you so very sure of getting your own way?\" she asked, laughing. \" Your autocratic govern ment has absolutely reduced me to the meekness of a slave.\" \" Am I such a great tyrant ?\" he asked, smiling. \"Terrible,\" she answered, \"in anything which promotes my good or happiness. It is dreadfully bad for you to have your own way so completely ; but I am powerless to resist.\" Then, changing her tone and looking serious, \"You left the men in the middle of harvest to fetch me ?\""], [191, "A BUNCH OF POPPIES. 183 \"Yes,\" he answered: \"the sunshine is fading; put on your habit. How do you think the men will get on without me ?\" \"Better than I could,\" she returned, thinking of all his unselfish goodness to her ; \" much better than I could.\" As she turned away and left him he leaned back against the window-frame, and, taking off his hat, let the faint breeze play with his bonny brown hair. Over the marshes he could hear the bleating of the sheep, and he could almost hear the beating of his own heart. Was Hannah right when she said, \" The day when that dead man's letter found its way into this house was a bad day for you. Put Mr. Bannerleigh's letter in the fire, and leave Mr. Bannerleigh's daughter to the people she is used to : it is best for her and best for you\"? \" Not best for me,\" he said half aloud. \" No harm will come of it if I remember. For six months I have remembered it, always save that once when her tears came between the barrier and me, and hid it from me ; then for one mad moment I forgot.\" They were riding side by side over the uneven road, Max and Enid, talking of a thousand things which during the past six months had become of mutual interest. Books and politics were once, to Max, sub jects of complete indifference ; but the desire to make"], [192, "184 A BUNCH OF POPPIES. Enid's life less desolate induced him to cultivate both, and gave them a topic in common on which to converse. Enid recollected, and smiled to herself over the recollection, the first time she saw Max with a book in his hand. She had left her Tennyson on the table, open at Elaine's song of love and death ; when she came back he was reading it. He closed the book hastily, and laid it on the table. \" You were reading,\" she said, with a ring of genu ine pleasure in her voice. \" 0, I am so glad ; now we shall always have something to talk about !\" \" I don't think I was reading,\" he answered can didly. \"I do not care for poetry ; it rather worries me to read it.\" \" May I read some of my favourite poems aloud to you ?\" she asked eagerly. \" You would like them \u2014 you could not help it ; they are like a chord of music struck on one's heart.\" And he had answered, \"Are they?\" and then, listening to her sweet voice as she read, with an inspired fire of appreciation lighting up her face, the words wholly escaped him, and only her tone and look remained. But it was not always so ; it could not be. She knew the days of seed-time must come before the days of harvest : verily they had, and now \u2014 now the harvest was being reaped. At the end of a brisk gallop Enid turned to her companion."], [193, "A BUNCH OF POPPIES. 185 \" Here are the poppies,\" she said \u2014 \" my promised reward for such implicit obedience.\" They turned into a field, where the men and women were busy at work. Max jumped off his horse, and Enid stooped down and patted her mare's neck. \" You beauty,\" she said. \" What should I do without you, Fleetfoot?\" The little thoroughbred arched her neck, and evi dently appreciated the caress. \" Here are the poppies,\" said Max, coming up with a bunch in his hand. \"lam afraid they will make your head ache.\" She fastened them in her habit, and then looked at him with a little flash of defiance in her beautiful eyes. \" How prejudiced you are against them !\" she said. \"Are you going to let my love for them prejudice you against me ?\" He stretched out his hand, and, taking two from the bunch, put them in his pocket-book. \" Converted already?\" she asked slyly. \" Who knows,\" he answered, \" but that I may care for them more than you do, and keep them longer ?\" \" They soon fade,\" she said. \" I do not care for them when they are dead.\" He sprang on his horse \"Ride about as long as you like,\" he said. \"I must see after the men, and give my steward orders, and then I will join you at the shepherd's cottage. We will have tea there, and ride home in the cool of the evening.\""], [194, "\"YOU WILL NEVER COME BACK,\" HE SAID. 186 \" Delightful !\" returned Enid. \" Au revoir !\" and, putting her horse into a brisk canter, she jumped over a hedge, and was soon out of sight. Max rode slowly towards the men, still looking after her. Involuntarily his hand sought his pocket-book. \" They were hers, and now they are mine,\" he said \u2014 \" mine.\" CHAPTER XXII. \"YOU \"WILL NEVER COME BACK,\" HE SAID \" Empress Gate, November 20, 18 \u2014 . \" My dear Miss Bannerleigh, \u2014 London has gone mad by reason of having found something new to talk about.

I am going to exercise the privilege of my adopted rela tionship, and give you some. The first vol. of your new novel tells me that your residence in those abom inable Fens must come to an end. \"Do not be angry or disheartened by the following"], [195, "\" YOU WILL NEVER COME BACK,\" HE SAID. 187 criticism. The ms. which you have just forwarded is, in some respects, better written than the published one, but in the character-drawing I see a decided fall ing off. Your people are drawn more from imagina tion than life, and you are getting morbid. There is an unhealthy strain about the book which I do not like ; it means that your nerves are unstrung. You must have change of scene and a complete rest. \" Now, I have a proposal to make. \" My sister, who has been travelling abroad, is going to Mentone early in March, w*here she will remain for at least two months, and will then come to my house in town for the season. Will you be her guest and mine at both places ? As a chaperon she is unri valled, as a companion delightful. Your consent to the plan will really give us more pleasure than you have any idea of. Blame my conceit, if you like, for this desire to exhibit a lion for the public edification. Lock up the Inferno and read Mark Twain, put away the pens and ink, and make that interesting specimen of humanity (in my disrespectful reference to whom I incurred your displeasure) take you out for a good gallop every day. Finally, write to me by return of post, and say you will join us at Mentone, and then (your word being your bond) I shall have something pleasant and certain to look forward to. \u2014 Always most sincerely yours, Frederic Summerly.\" \"You have had good news,\" said Max, looking up from the newspaper in his hand."], [196, "\" YOU will never come back,\" he said. 188 It was five o'clock on a dark November afternoon. The wind was sighing and howling round the house ; its voice, like the wail of a lost soul, came across the marshes, 0, so sadly, so hopelessly. Old John had just returned from Fag End, bringing the second post letters and the newspapers, luxuries not often enjoyed by the inmates of the farm before the following morning. \" Good and bad,\" returned Enid, who was standing by the table, that the lamp-light might fall on her letter. \" Mr. Summerly is not satisfied with my ms.\" \" Have you forgotten to cross the t's or dot the i's ?\" he asked, smiling. \" He does not specially refer to those omissions,\" she answered ; \" the whole thing seems faulty from his point of view.\" \" His opinion is not infallible,\" said Max. \"What is the pleasant part of the letter ? You looked very happy while you were reading it.\" The old bright smile came into her face again. \" He sends me the very kindest invitation possible,\" she answered. \"I am to go and stay with his sister at Mentone for two months, and remain with her in London for the season afterwards.\" There was silence. Max raised the newspaper, so that his face was hidden from her. \" When ?\" he asked at length. She was thinking so intently of her letter that she failed to notice the change in his voice."], [197, "\" YOU WILL NEVER COME BACK,\" HE SAID. 189 \"Early in March,\" she answered; \"only four months !\" \" How glad you will be to get away from this place among people of your own world !\" The bitter despair in his voice startled Enid. \" Don't say unkind things, \"she said, in a low voice, and going a step nearer to him. \" I think if you do, you will be sorry some day. Mr. Summerly thinks a change necessary for me from a professional point of view; he says I am becoming morbid and unreal.\" \" I did not mean to be unkind,\" returned Max gently; \"the change will do you good and make you happy.\" \" I am happy here,\" she said, with an effort. He still kept the paper before his face. \" Mr. Summerly says I must put away my work and take plenty of exercise,\" remarked Enid. \" Will you let me go for rides with you very often ? Fleetfoot will highly approve of the arrangement.\" The knowledge that her great gladness to leave the farm had been cruel suddenly became very apparent to her. She had made this man love her because she had no one else to turn to ; she never analysed her feelings towards him, but the thought that- she had caused him pain touched her keenly7. \" Will you let me come back after my visit ?\" she said, going up to him; \"I shall have some new ideas then, and be a better companion for you.\" He looked at her, still with the bitter despair in his face."], [198, "190 ALONE IN THE BLACK NIGHT. \" You will never come back,\" ho said ; \" you know it as well as I do.\" \"Don't be hard on me,\" she said pleadingly, hold ing out her hands towards him. Great Heaven ! how the barrier between them tottered ! With all his strength he propped it up : if he touched her, if he looked at her, his self-control was lost. She knew it as well as he did, and her hands dropped at her sides. \" Why should you suspect me of a desire to be either hard or unkind ?\" he said, rising as he spoke ; \" the dearest wish of my heart is for your good and happiness.\" With the last word still on his lips he left the room. CHAPTER XXIII. ALONE IN THE BLACK NIGHT \" I do not much like the idea of having only old John for our protection. Hark ! how drearily the wind moans ! The reflection that screaming oneself into a fit for assistance could be attended by only the most disastrous consequences is more exciting than pleasant.\" It was Enid who spoke. There was a half-frightened look in her eyes as they rested on Max that February night, in spite of the light tone she assumed. He"], [199, "ALONE IN THE BLACK NIGHT. 191 answered the tone only, for the simple reason that he was not looking at her. \" What are you afraid of?\" he said. She glanced across the table at Mrs. Bannerleigh working as industriously as ever, at the cat purring on the hearth, at the pack of cards lying on the table, and then back again at Max. \"I scarcely know,\" she said; \"but if I were writing a tragedy, this is just the kind of place where I should lay the scene.\" \"You have never felt afraid before,\" he observed; \" I don't see why you should now.\" \" You have never been away for a night, as you will be to-morrow.\" \" I have been to receive this money annually for the last fifteen years, and nothing has ever happened. Mr. Summerly is quite right, you are nervous. I wish I could put off the journey for a fortnight. You will be quite safe at Mentone then.\" \" When I first came here I was afraid of nothing,\" she said. \" I wonder what has made a coward of me? The change is both unpleasant and inconvenient.\" \" Perhaps you would like to have the revolver loaded ?\" he said, still half-jestingly. \" I have one in an excellent state of preservation. Most ladies are more afraid of sire-arms than thieves.\" \"I am not in the least afraid of fire-arms,\" she returned. \"I had a pistol of my own once, and used to shoot at a mark in the garden-wall. I am much more afraid of thieves.\""], [200, "192 ALONE IN THE BLACK NIGHT. \"Thieves! thieves!\" shrieked Mrs. Bannerleigh. \" Who talked of thieves ? There is nothing to steal here.\" And then, as on that night nearly a year ago, when Enid first saw her, she hastened up-stairs to her hidden treasure. \" Do people know she is a miser ?\" asked Enid, looking after her with a shudder. \"No, I think not,\" he answered. \"Hannah is as silent as the grave ; no one else has the opportunity of finding it out.\" Almost before be had finished speaking, the sound of voices in angry altercation startled them both. \" I tell you I will see him ! Let me come in, I say !\" cried a gruff voice. A scuffle ensued, and then something breakable fell on the kitchen floor with a crash. In an instant Max had closed the door behind him, and left Enid alone. She could not hear the conversation, which, how ever, was carried on in loud tones ; three people at least seemed to be talking at once. Gradually the noise became more subdued, and ceased altogether. She could bear the suspense no longer. With trem bling limbs she went into the kitchen. At the back door stood Hannah, peering into the darkness. \" What is the matter ?\" cried Enid. \" It's those Raby fellows at it again,\" said Hannah, clenching her bands; \"they will come to no good, all the lot of them.\" \" What did they want ?\""], [201, "ALONE IN THE BLACK NIGHT. 193 \" The master paid two of them off yesterday, and to-night they come to beg on again. I tried to keep them out, but they were half drunk, and nearly knocked me down.\" \" Mr. Lyndern will not take them on again ?\" said Enid questioningly. \" No. The brother has just come back, after ten years' penal servitude. They arc a bad lot altogether ; the master's well shut (rid) of them.\" \" Whom are you looking for ?\" asked Enid. \" The master.\" \" Is he out there ?\" her face turning even paler than before ; \" alone with those horrible men in the darkness ?\" Hannah nodded. \" He went to see them safe off the premises,\" she said. Like a flash Enid had passed her, and disappeared into the night. \" Max, Max!\" she cried, lifting her voice in agonised appeal, and stumbling on. \"Max, come back !\" The last time his name passed her lips it had the piteous cry in it of an unanswered prayer. She had not an idea where she was, but for herself she felt no fear ; the horror of his danger seemed to have completely swallowed it up. \" Max !\" For the last time she called to him, and as she did so, she heard his footfall coming over the stone3 to wards her. \" I am here,\" he said cheerfully, \" all right.\" o"], [202, "194 ALONE IN THE BLACK NIGHT. \"How could you do it!\" she cried, clinging to him ; \" they might have murdered you !\" \" I am not afraid,\" he said. \" You should not have come out; you were quite safe in the house.\" \" 0, what a coward you must think me !\" she ex claimed, unclasping her hands from around his arm ; \" I was not thinking of myself at all ; I was afraid for you.\" a \" And came out here to take care of me ?\" \"I thought if you heard me calling to you, you would come back,\" she said, laughing hysterically ; \"it was not a very courageous form of protection, but it was the only one in my power.\" \"Are they safe off, master?\" asked Hannah, still standing at the door. \" Yes,\" he answered, passing her and going in with Enid. \"As the missis does not appreciate oui society sufficiently to stay with us, we will stay here with you for a little time.\" He placed a chair before the fire for Enid as he spoke, and took another himself. Hannah saw in a moment that his easy light manner was not in the least natural, and his laugh was forced. He still talked on in the same way, merrily, jestingly, unnatur ally until Enid rose to go. \" Good-night,\" he said. \" You need not be at all nervous ; you are quite safe.\" Just for an instant his manner changed; it was when her hand lay in his. \" In spite of himself his eyes betray him whenever"], [203, "ALONE IN THE BLACK NIGHT. 195 he looks at me,\" she said to herself. \"Laurence Vanlyn never cared for me like that. Poor Max ! I wonder if I am glad or sorry ? I think \u2014 yes, I am sure I am glad.\" \" Wake up, miss ; it is morning. \" So it is !\" said Enid, opening her eyes. \"Am I late for breakfast ? has Mr. Lyndern gone ?\" \"Hours ago,\" returned the old servant; \"he started before it was light, and left me this 'ere to give you.\" Enid hastily unfolded the note ; it began abruptly, and amounted only to a message : \" In consequence of the little episode last night, and the fear which you expressed at running the risk of murder, fire, or thieves, with only old John as your protector, I have arranged to return home to-night. It is very uncertain at what time I shall arrive, as I must drive all the way. The revolver is loaded, and in the drawer in my room. If you are at all nervous, you will know where to find it. It will be as well not to discharge it unless it is absolutely necessary. \" Max.' It was written just in the same strain as his con versation of last night \u2014 half in fun, half in earnest. \" Mr. Lyndern is coming home to-night,\" said Enid, looking at her companion. \"Yes,\" she returned moodily : \" seventy mile is a"], [204, "196 PERIL good step to go in one day ; but he would do it. He said he should drive to Fag End, and hire from there.\" \" Has he gone alone ?\" asked Enid. \"Ay, alone,\" she answered. CHAPTER XXIV. PERIL. \" What an awful night it is!\" said Enid. \" I wish with all my heart he was not coming home until to- morrow.\" She walked to the window as she spoke, and drawing aside the curtain, looked out into the darkness beyond. Mrs. Bannerleigh sat rocking herself to and fro in the greatest state of restless excitement. As Enid spoke she rose and went to her. \" What are you afraid of ?\" she asked, shaking the girl's arm roughly; \" you don't think he will lose it?\" \" Lose what ?\" said Enid, shrinking a little fur ther from the terrible old woman. \" Lose his way?\" \" No, no, the precious money. I could not live without it, I am so poor.\" \" The money is all right,\" returned the girl im patiently. \" I was thinking of him.

There's a plot on foot for stopping the master at the cross-roads as he comes home to-night, and robbing him. He will not submit to that without a struggle, and the Rabys are desperate ruffians ; there will be murder done this night.\" Enid put her hand to her head. \" The cross-roads,\" she said; \" let me think, let me think.\" \" Think and pray,\" returned Hannah, \"it's all we women can do. God help us !\" \"No, it is not,\" cried Enid; \"get me a flask of brandy, and tell old John to saddle Fleetfoot.\" In an instant she had left the room. \" What can the lass do ?\" said Hannah despair ingly- \" Do as she tells you !\" shrieked Mrs. Bannerleigh. \" Two hundred golden sovereigns are in danger this night \u2014 two hundred !\" Still staggering blindly forward, Hannah went to"], [206, "198 PERIL, the stable and roused old John, who was asleep in the straw. \" Saddle the mare,\" she said ; \" for the love of Heaven, saddle her quickly!\" The only perfectly calm person of the four was Enid. Her face was still deadly pale, but there was no fear in it \u2014 only a great resolution to save Max Lyn dern. Everything depended upon her strength of nerve, and she knew it. Before three minutes had passed, she came down stairs with the revolver tucked in her habit. \" The flask,\" was all she said; and then taking it from Hannah, passed out into the darkness. Old John was struggling with the girths when she reached the stable. She pushed him aside, and with a superhuman effort fastened them herself; then, almost before he was aware of it, she put her hand on his shoulder and sprang into the saddle. \" It's like going into a wolf's throat,\" said Hannah, wringing her hands ; \" she will lose her way.\" Then raising her voice, so that it rang again and again across the desolate marshes, \" The cross-roads, Miss Enid, the cross-roads !\" In the bar of the Blue Boar at Fag End the fire was blazing brightly, and the smoke from three long clay pipes and a rather inferior cigar ascended in a social and harmonious cloud. One of the smokers, a red-nosed native of the vil lage, sat nearest the fire, and divided his attention"], [207, "199 PERIL between a spittoon standing on tho right-hand side of him, and a glass of hot grog standing on the left. He took no part in the conversation of his companions, but from time to time uttered grunts of disapproval or assent, as the case might be. The man smoking a cigar puffed a cloud out of his mouth, and continued his observations in a somewhat dictatorial tone. \" I always told you, Mr. Smithers,\" he said, address ing the man nearest to him, \" I always told you that if the parson persisted in preaching such confoundedly long sermons he would empty the church. I said to him myself, ' Mr. Weaks,' I said, ' the congregation will not submit to more than thirty-five minutes,' I said, ' so it's no use you trying it on,' I said.\" \" I never patronise church myself,\" returned the gentleman addressed, with condescending impartiality ; \" what I say is this : there's the church and there's the parson; take um as they are or leave um alone. I leave um alone.\" The subject evidently possessed no interest for the third occupant of the bar : he rose slowly and knocked the ashes out of his pipe. \" Well,\" he said, yawning, \" I suppose I must be going: I don't much like the idea of turning out, though ; what a night it is, to be sure !\" \" It's not fit to turn a dog out,\" observed the fourth man \u2014 \" dark as pitch, and a wind strong and bitter enough to cut you in two.\" \" Some one's been out in it,\" said the smoker of"], [208, "200 PERIL. the cigar ; \" leastways, if them ain't wheels coming into the yard, I'm a Dutchman.\" \" Nonsense 1\" \"I lay you a sovereign I am right, and here's the man.\" As he spoke, Max appeared in the doorway. The red-nosed man by the fire turned his head and grunted. \"Evening, sir,\" he said. The others followed suit. Max unbuttoned his ulster, walked to the fire, and rubbed his hands together. \"Good-evening, gentlemen,\" he returned; \"a rough night, is not it ?\" \" Ay, so it is ; we was just a-saying the wind is keen enough to cut you in two. Had a long drive, sir?\" Max laughed pleasantly. \" Yes,\" he answered ; \" and I have another before me : I must get home to-night.\" The owner of the highly-coloured feature conde scended to make an assertion. \" The man as drives from Fag End to the Marsh Farm on a night like this,\" he said, \"ain't, to my mind, a enviable object.\" Max laughed again. \" I don't much care about it myself,\" he said ; \"but I promised I would get home to-night.\" \" Have a glass of something hot before you start,\" suggested the vicar's mentor. \"I have just ordered it,\" returned Max. \"Ah, thank you, Mrs. Reynolds ; is my horse up ?\""], [209, "HELP ! HELP ! 201 \" Yes, sir,\" replied the landlady. \" Never mind the change,\" he said ; and emptying his glass, he buttoned up his coat and prepared for departure. \" Good-night, gentlemen,\" he said, and went out. Out into the wind and darkness, perhaps to his death, for Enid's sake. CHAPTER XXV. HELP ! HELP ! Quicksilver struggled on bravely against the wind and rain ; but, in spite of all his efforts, it was impos sible to proceed anything but very slowly. Max reached the cross-roads at last. Before he had turned the corner a sharp cry fell on his ear: \"Help! help!\" He could not tell whether it was uttered by a woman or child, and he could see nothing beyond the faint outline of the road on either side of him. He drew rein, and listened intently, but the roar of the wind in his ears almost deafened him ; then above it came the cry once more : \"Help! help!\" \" Hi ! All right !\" shouted Max. The sound of his voice was the signal for attack. The next instant two men, who had crept up behind him, sprang into the cart, while a third seized the horse's bridle."], [210, "202 HELP ! HELP !

One man's hand was at bis throat ; the other held back his arms, making him, for the time, practically helpless. \"You cowards !\" he gasped, as well as he was able. \" Would you murder me ?\" He was nearly choked by this time, but, by a super human effort, he managed to free one of his arms, and struck out with all the power that remained to him ; but he struck out blindly, and in vain. The ruffian at his throat dodged on one side, still keeping his hold, and the blow missed him. The men's faces were covered with crape masks, so that they were totally unrecognisable. Hitherto they had not betrayed themselves by speaking, but now, mad at being so long baffled, they forgot the precau tion of silence. Max recognised their voices, as they knew he would. \" It's all up now. End him, Bill !\" cried the man clinging to Max's arm. There was an awful moment of suspense, and then the sound of horse's hoofs galloping furiously along the road fell on their ears. The next instant the report of a pistol rang sharply through the air. As by one consent the men relaxed their grasp. Another report \u2014 much nearer this time. They did not wait for a third ; the plot had been discovered. Baffled and defeated, they scrambled down from"], [211, "HELP !

Then clearly and distinctly his name rang out in the brave sweet tones he heard so plainly the night before : \" Max, Max ! where are you ?\" \" Here !\" he called back again as well as he was able. It was all Enid could do to hold in the little thoroughbred. Ah, if it had not been for those old September days, when they both became so familiar with hearing the report of Max Lyndern's gun, the probability is she would have bolted ; but Enid's hand on the bridle and Enid's voice in her ear quieted her alarm. Max could see both horse and rider now ; they were beside the cart. \"Are you hurt?\" cried Enid, the awful suspense of the moment coming out in the terror of her voice. \" I fired in the air.\" \" No,\" he answered faintly, as he grasped for the reins, which had happily caught on the cart. The horse, exhausted by the strength of the wind, had never moved. \"What an awful night for you to be out !\" gasped Max.

Hannah and old John were waiting in an agony of suspense in the stable. At the sound of wheels they rushed out. \" 0 master !\" cried Hannah. \" Are you safe ?\" \" Yes,\" answered Max, who had now recovered from the effects of the attack, \" I am all right.\" He threw the reins to old John, and sprang out of the cart, with his eyes still fixed on Enid. The light from the lantern showed him how pale she was ; but the wild excitement in her eyes came upon him with a shock."], [213, "205 HELP ! HELP ! \" Help me!\" she said, stretching out her arms to him. \" Max, I am falling.\" The strain being over, reaction had set in. She staggered helplessly forward, shaking violently from head to foot. \" It has been too much for you,\" said Max hoarsely; and then, scarcely knowing what he did, he half carried her into the house, Hannah following. Mrs. Bannerleigh met them in the entrance ; her face was working horribly. The sound which she dreaded to hear had been ringing in her ears for two hours, and almost driven her mad. She clutched at Max as a vulture might clutch at its prey. \" The money !\" she cried. \" Did they get the money ?\" He pulled out his pocket-book, and threw it on the table. \" There it is,\" he said, shaking her off; and then he turned to Enid. \" I am all right,\" said the girl bravely, but un steadily. She had carried the little revolver in her hand all the way home. With trembling hands she laid it on the table. Max poured out some wine, and gave it to her in silence. Hannah seemed possessed with a great desire to atone for her previous distrust. She took Enid's hat off, rubbed her hands, and insisted upon her sitting in the armchair by the fire. There was literally nothing"], [214, "HELP ! HELP ! 206 left for Max to do but relate the adventure in the form of answering the numerous questions the old servant addressed to him. They none of them noticed Mrs. Bannerleigh crouching in the corner. The recovery of the money, after the fear of losing it, had at last turned her brain. Creeping along by the wall to the door, she escaped from the room, and, with a laugh of triumph, scram bled up-stairs. \"Listen to that !\" said Max, with a shudder. Hannah turned round. \"She's off her head to-night !\" she said. \"Look after yourself and Miss Bannerleigh, and leave the missus to me.\" As soon as she had gone Max went to Enid. One glance at him told her that the barrier between them tottered mightily, and for the last time. He stood before her in his great height and strength, his eyes fixed on her face. A moment more, and the ruins of the fallen barrier alone divided them. \" Why did you do it ?\" he asked hoarsely. \" Why did you risk your life so recklessly to save mine ?\" The suppressed passion in his voice almost fright ened her. \" I cannot tell you,\" she said, moving uneasily, and looking away. \" You would have done it for any one else ?\" \" I did not do much,\" she returned evasively ; \" but I did it for you.\""], [215, "nELP !

Whether for good or evil, happiness or misery, who shall say ? If it had not been such a perfect jewel, the chances are the effect of the refining influence would have been neither so speedy or so complete. It began imperceptibly ; and the pivot upon which it turned, the key to the whole thing, lay in Max's own words on the night of Enid's arrival : \" I want to disgust Miss Bannerleigh as little as possible with her surround ings.\" That was how the work began. Until then his mind had been allowed to remain fallow, because there was no incentive to cultivation. There was nothing in his surroundings to bring out the good qualities which he possessed, only the old monotonous routine to be gone through day after day, and then \u2014 mental stagnation. But the great heart of the man remained as great as ever ; the complete unselfishness and strength of his nature in no way died, they did but slumber, because very, very seldom the need for exer cising them arose."], [217, "209 TEN TIMES BETTER THAN MY OWN SOUL. \" It is better to have loved and lost Than never to have loved at all.\" I know not which state is the happier of the two, the inexpressible, unfathomable happiness and misery of life, or the serene insensibility of existence. What weak mortals we are ! Why should the knowledge that we have altered the whole course of a life \u2014 awakened hopes, ideas, aspirations in a fellow creature's heart which have slumbered \u2014 give us satis faction and a feeling of exultation ? To some extent it was Laurence Vanlyn's teaching which was for the second time influencing Enid's life. Just as he taught her to like and admire all he liked and admired, just as the knowledge of his growing influence over her flattered his vanity, so her influence over Max flattered hers. Of course, with quite a dif ferent result, she told herself. She loved Max dearly, not in the way she had loved that other man \u2014 0 no, the \" tears which flow but once a life \" had flowed in a blinding torrent from her eyes into the grave of that first and last passionate love ; but it was so hopeless to dwell upon it now ; it was far, far better to try and remember that it was really buried for ever ; and the daisies which sprang up from it's grave she wrought into chains for binding another heart to her own. \" How inexpressibly dreary it will be here without you !\" said Max, with a great yearning in his eyes.

My literary work is the strongest influence in my life.\" \" Has it always been so ?\" he asked dreamily. \" Never stronger than it is now,\" she answered evasively, thinking of the time when it was as nothing \u2014 the time when between herself and it Laurence Van lyn came, and blotted it out as completely as though it never had been. \" My darling,\" said Max tenderly, \" do you think I would let a cloud the size of a man's hand come be tween you and your happiness if I could help it ? I am as ambitious for you as you can be for yourself. If you only knew how much I loved you, you would not doubt it.\" \" How much ?\" she asked, resting her head lightly on his shoulder. \" Shall I tell you, Enid ? Ten times better than my oivn soul.\" She moved a little uneasily. \" I wish you did not care for me quite so much,\" she said ; \" I am so unworthy of you ;\" a sudden feeling of remorse coming into her heart at taking all the passionate wealth of this man's love, and giving him nothing but the dregs of a disappointed life in re turn. \"Don't wish that,\" he answered, in a low voice. \" It is no use ; whatever comes I am yours, body and soul, now and for ever.\""], [220, "212 TEN TIMES BETTER THAN MY OWN SOUL. A week later and the little star had ceased to shine upon the dreary marshes, the farm had assumed its old appearance of desolation, the ringing laugh that echoed so gaily through the passages was silent. Enid had gone, taking the brightness which she created away with her, and leaving only the remembrance of it behind. It was just such a night as that on which Enid came to them \u2014 cold, comfortless, bleak without, cheery and warm within. Just as on that night, too, Hannah stood at the door, listening for her master's return. As he came up the yard towards her, she greeted him as before. \"Well?\" \" She has gone,\" said Max, coming in ; and then he forgot to say anything more, but taking off his coat, threw himself into a chair by the kitchen fire. \" She went off as merry as usual, I suppose,\" said Hannah ironically ; \"thinking of all the pleasures she's a-going to. Do you remember what you said the night as she came here ? I do. The very words was, ' She comes from another world from ours, and she can never forget it any more than I can.' She has gone back to her own world now.\" Max laughed uneasily and with an effort, yet he bravely faced the insinuation, as a soldier faces the enemy. \" You think that, although she managed to forget it while she was here,\" he said, \" she will remember it when she gets away ?\""], [221, "213 TEN TIME3 BETTER THAN MY OWN SOUL. \" I think,\" answered Hannah, \" that you made the first great mistake in your life when you brought her here, and the second when you let her go away.\" Max laughed again. \" Because she will not want to come back ?\" \" She will never come back.\" \" Perhaps I shall not ask her,\" smiling. \" 0 master,\" cried Hannah, the ironical bitterness in her voice suddenly changing to dire apprehension, \"you will not do that?\" \" Do what ?\" asked Max, looking dreamily at the fire with that peculiar smile still on his face, as though a glimpse of heaven had been vouchsafed to him and no one else. I have sometimes seen such a smile on a human face \u2014 alas ! how feebly inadequate are these poor words of mine to describe it ! \" I have dreaded it all along,\" continued Hannah, not answering his question. \" 0 my dear, it will break my heart, if you give up the poor old place, and go away.\" \" I could not ask her to pass her life here,\" said Max, as much in answer to his own thoughts as his companion's words ; \" she feels the dreariness of it so much, she would not be happy.\" \" If she cared for you as much as you do for her,\" returned Hannah, \" she would be happy with you any where.\" \"lam getting tired of the monotony of it myself,\" he said, loyally defending her, and taking the reproach of weariness on himself. \" A man ought not to stag-"], [222, "214 A GHOST OF THE PAST. nate as I do ; at some time or other he must live : and if I ever intend to, it is quite time I began.\" \" You never thought so until she came,\" said Hannah sorrowfully. \" You will give up everything for her. You will put yourself under her feet, and ask her to walk over you; and she will despise you for doing it.\" \" No, no,\" he said quickly, \" she is too good and true to do that. But even if she did, it would make no difference \u2014 I should love her just the same ; there is no limit to my love. I will live for her, or I will die for her. The future of my life I have placed un reservedly in her hands, and she will do with it as she sees fit.\" CHAPTER XXVII. A GHOST OF THE PAST. Mrs. Bannerleigh was dead. As she lived, unloving and unloved, so her miser able soul went to its long account. In the cold gray light of morning her old servant found her. She had crept from her bed, hearing for the last time the dreaded voice that echoed perpetually in her heart, and demanded her treasure ; and hearing it, she feebly tottered to the hiding-place, and with her arms clasped around the bags of gold she died \u2014 a slave. \" The ruling passion strong in death.\""], [223, "215 A GHOST OF THE PAST. 0, how degrading is this miserable sordid greed for gain ! It makes brutes of what were once men, it debases the intellect, it distorts the mind, and destroys all that should be most generous and noble in man, giving him in his self-imposed slavery a foretaste on earth of the terrors beyond the grave. Mrs. Bannerleigh was missed, but not wanted. It was a relief to both Max and Hannah that the shrill voice, always raised in anger or complaint, was silent. None of the subterfuges so often practised to deceive or banish her were now necessary. She was gone, and they were at. peace. In the generosity of their hearts they pitied her. They could not have done either less or more, and so forbore to speak of her. In those days Enid's letters were the only things Max had to look forward to. Night after night he read them through, till he knew them by heart; and then, restless and unsettled, he wandered about, and thought how slowly the days passed, and how weary he had become of the unbearable monotony of his life. The first letter Max received was written directly after her arrival at Mentone. \" I cannot, of course, tell you much about this place,\" she wrote; \"but it strikes me as being very pleasant and diverting. I feel a different being alto gether even in this short time. Miss Summerly is all her brother described her. I am sure we shall become excellent friends. She is so clever and amusing, and kinder than words can express.\""], [224, "216 A GHOST OF THE PAST. The second letter was much in the same strain : \" I am so immensely happy, Max ; between driving about, playing tennis, and reading, the days simply fly. I am afraid with you they must go slowly. The thought of the existence you are condemned to drag through depresses me horribly whenever I think of it. I am quite sure now Mr. Summerly was right. I was getting morbid ; it was quite time to have a thorough change. Last night I was reading ' Evangeline ' aloud to Miss Summerly. The last time I read it was with you, dear. Do you remember that evening ? I do very well. When I got to the lines, ' All the dull deep pain And the constant anguish of patience,' you said them before I could do so, and I knew then that you must have read the poem often to know it so well. Last night I made a little pause in that place. It was a stupid, useless thing to do ; but just then a great longing came into my heart to hear your voice. It has always haunted me from the first day I heard it. \"I find I left my Tennyson in the bookcase. Would you mind sending it to me, as it is a very old friend, although I have sadly neglected it of late ? Indeed, I believe the last time I read it was on the evening before our perilous adventure at the cross-roads.\" With an almost feverish eagerness Max rose to find the book. It was something of hers, the last hand that"], [225, "217 A WILLING SLAVE. touched it was hers, the last eyes that read it were hen, the very words would seem like her voice speaking to him across the sea \u2014 speaking to him from that other world, wherein she was \" so immensely happy.\" It opened quite naturally at her favourite poem, \" Fatima.\" In a second the little pencil line caught his eye beneath these words, \" O love ! O fire ! once he drew With one long kiss my whole soul through My lips, as sunlight drinketh dew.\" He read no more, and the colour gradually left his face. For about ten minutes he sat there, bravely facing the truth. \" What a fool I am to mind now !\" he said to himself. \" I might have known I was not the first fellow she cared about ; I cannot expect to be more than the last.\" Yet the words haunted him like a nightmare. \"I had never kissed her when she drew that line,\" he mused. \" I wonder how long it has been there, and if time will ever bring that man and me face to face ?\" CHAPTER XXVIII. A WILLING SLAVE. \" I was very thankful to get your last letter, and to hear you were well and happy,\" wrote Max. \"I have"], [226, "218 A WILLING SLAVE. some important news to tell you. The miserable life of the poor old missis has come to an end. Her death, only less pitiable than her life, has, I trust, brought her the peace which in this world she never found. \" The interest of the money (amounting to 500/. a year) which came to her absolutely at your uncle Mr. Bannerleigh's death she has carefully hoarded for the last fifteen years, only spending during that time 201. This now represents a sum of 7500/. \"By a will made at the time of your uncle's death the whole of the property is left to me, in addition to the property my father left me, which included the farm. \" It appears to me simply an act of justice to make over to you the principal and interest of the money, which came from your family, and to which I have no moral right. I have therefore instructed my solicitor to arrange the matter as expeditiously as possible, and in the mean time placed to your account in the bank 7480/., which we found hidden in the house at the time of Mrs. Bannerleigh's death. \" When you come back to London we can find a safe investment for any balance which you may care to so dispose of. Those are all the business details I am going to trouble you with. I cannot rest here now, Enid ; it is so wretched without you. After your last letter, any lingering doubts which remained in my mind as to the possibility of your being happy in the Fens have disappeared. I have made up my mind to let the farm, and live in London or travel about, just"], [227, "219 A WILLING SLAVE. which you like best. Fortunately I know of a man who will take the farm off my hands at Lady Day, and in the mean time my steward can do all that is necessary in my absence. Probably when you return you will find me temporarily located in London. I shall make no definite arrangements till I see you. Business will con stantly need my presence in town, and the excitement of the new life and surroundings will help me through the dreary weeks of existence until you come back.\" It was quite true ; he could not bear the monotony of the old existence, and his nerves were not in a state to try. If Enid had never disturbed the calm serenity of his life, had not awoke in his heart the desire to mix with his fellow-creatures ; if by her companionship and mental cultivation she had not so clearly shown him that there was a world outside his narrow groove of which he had been practically ignorant \u2014 the proba bilities are he would have lived contentedly happy among his sheep and turnips. But Eve gave him the apple, and he ate thereof ; the die was cast, the knowledge in his possession never to be forgotten. There was no need for him to remain in the marshes \u2014 pecuniarily there never had been. The money which his father toiled for and saved was amply sufficient to provide for the moderate wants of his son ; but until now Max never cared to avail him self of the life of idleness within his reach. For years he had been saving money, not from the least desire to hoard it, but because he had neither the opportunity nor. the inclination to spend it. And he liked work ;"], [228, "220 A WILLING SLAVE. in it he found his happiness, and consequently had no thought or wish beyond. But weariness of his present life was not the only cause for Max's restlessness. Every letter he received from Enid, although it was always as kind and affec tionate as the last, still seemed to give him a terrible feeling of placing them farther apart. He appeared such a contrast to the people with whom she was daily mix ing ; her pleasures and pursuits were those of society and the world of fashion, of which he simply knew nothing. When she came back he must strike her as being stupid and uninteresting, and be very much \"out of it \" altogether. He knew that two months of London life would altel- him, and he meant to try it. Mr. Bartlemew, his solicitor, lived in London, and through him Max could obtain introductions, and probably get proposed as member of some club at which he could make head-quarters. He meant to have his horses up, and \u2014 anyway, until he was married \u2014 lead the life of an idle man. In the bottom of his heart he knew that this new life he had mapped out for himself would not be so happy as the old one which satisfied him a year ago ; but the question of choice was not now in his power \u2014 he had but to do and die, if Fate so desired it. He had sworn that, body and soul, he was Enid's ; it was a willing slavery, and therefore a complete one \u2014 the slavery for which he lived, the only one wherein his soul delighted and found peace. It was a very bright, grateful letter that came back to Max in answer to his : full of thanks for his"], [229, "A WILLING SLAVE. 221 generosity, accepting it without demur because he wished it ; delighted that he had determined to give up his farm and travel about. She related some amusing anecdotes and accounts of the pleasures she was enjoying. \"You cannot imagine how happy I am, Max. The people we mix with are so polished and delightful, and quite spoil me in numberless ways. Of course I told Miss Summerly of your generosity, dear ; and she said, ' I think, Enid, your cousin must be the kindest and most liberal man living.' She persists in calling you my cousin, though I have repeatedly explained to her that we are only connected in the vaguest way possible. I think she is a little proud of her ingenuity in tracing the number of times our cousinship is removed. You have no idea how I get teased on having become what Mr. and Miss Summerly are pleased to call an ' heiress.' Mr. Summerly says he feels an increased responsibility in looking after my matrimonial prospects now. I have not told them I am engaged. I have two reasons for not doing so : one is, I want them to see and know you first; and the other, because I am greedy enough to wish to keep our secret quite to ourselves for just a little longer. Don't scold me, Max, for my selfishness : although they are kindness itself to me, it is not my duty to tell them everything, and the thought that you and I possess something of which no one else is aware seems to bring us closer together, and the thought makes me happy.\" \" She knows best, she knows best,\" Max said, fold-"], [230, "222 THE PLEASURE THAT'S ALMOST PAIN. ing up the letter with a sigh, and, in spite of himself, a feeling of disappointment that she seemed to look forward so little to their meeting in London, and showed so little joy at the prospect of his contemplated resi dence there. \" How unreasonable I am !\" he told him self. \" Is it possible that she, now she is so full of happiness and gaiety, can look forward to our meeting with the same degree of pleasure as I do, who am alone in this isolated place ? It will be all right when we meet.\" And so thinking of that meeting, the coming glimpse of heaven is again reflected on his face, the perfect idol of his soul's adoration passed before his eyes and dazzled him. He knew he was bound in unrelenting fetters, and, so gazing, gloried in his bondage. CHAPTER XXIX. \" the pleasure that's almost pain.' The day dawned at last \u2014 the day for which Max well Lyndern's'soul had pined and hungered\"; the joy of it seemed almost more than he\"eould' bear. It was scarcely light before he made his way through the chill morning air towards the Park, hurrying ou 'at an un reasonable pace because he could not go slowly, while his brain was on fire. I think often au~ insane idea gets into our heads that by hurrying ourselves we can hurry time also, and make it pass more quickly. After"], [231, "THE PLEASURE THAT'S ALMOST PAIN. 223 two hours' brisk walking he came to the Albert Memo rial, and, sitting down on one of the seats, read for the twentieth time Enid's last letter. It was very short, only telling him that on the previous night they would reach London, and enclosing a message from Miss Sum merly to the effect that she and her brother hoped he would give them the pleasure of his company at luncheon the following day. \"Even if I were certain at what time we shall reach London,\" wrote Enid in conclusion, \" I should ask you not to meet us at the station ; there would be no pleasure in seeing you with a crowd of people around, and if you did, Miss Sum merly would be certain to guess we were engaged, which would spoil all the fun. It will be such a sur prise for them when I tell them the news.\" \"Spoil all the fun!\" repeated Max; \"I suppose, because she is so happy and light-hearted, even this appears to her/?m.\" Yet with this explanation the word rankled in his heart ; it seemed so unsuitable to a subject the vital importance of which was to him beyond life or death. How slowly the hours dragged themselves away ! It seemed half a lifetime before his watch told him he might venture to present himself at Mr. Sum merly's house ; it seemed an eternity before the foot man opened the door. The ladies were out driving, but would be home very shortly ; would Mr. Lyndern come in and wait ? He tried to keep the sense of blank disappointment which filled his heart out of his face."], [232, "THE PLEASURE THAT'S ALMOST PAIN. 224 Yes, he would come in. He followed the man through the hall, and then found himself alone in a handsomely-furnished drawing room. On a small table lay a pile of photographs, me mentoes of their visit at Mentone; a vase of lovely hot house flowers stood beside them, half a dozen comic papers and some periodicals lay scattered about, and then suddenly the volume of Enid's favourite poems caught his eye. Very eagerly he took it in his hand, and opened it ; he remembered the night on which he opened it last, and how the words he then read haunted him for hours afterwards. He turned to the same place again ; in addition to the pencil line there was now written in the margin : \" Shinglebeach, August 3rd.\" Max started. \" That was the day, I suppose,\" he said, with parched lips; \"what can have made her rake it up again ? That was the day \u2014 who was the man?\" \" Mr. Lyndern, a thousand apologies for having left you so long alone,\" exclaimed Mr. Summerly, suddenly breaking in upon Max's meditations, and coming towards him with outstretched hand. \" I was detained by my lawyer until this moment.\" It spoke well for Summerly's self-control and knowledge of the world that he concealed every vestige of the intense surprise he felt at the appearance of his guest. Could this fine, fashionable-looking man,"], [233, "THE PLEASURE THAT'S ALMOST PAIN. 225 towering above him and looking every inch his height \u2014 this man, whose dress was unimpeachable and man ners totally free from the slightest embarrassment \u2014 be really the same individual described by Enid as resem bling a cattle-drover? It seemed incredible. When he spoke Mr. Summerly almost started, his voice was so deep and gentle, so different from what he expected. \" I must apologise for coming so early,\" said Max. \" My anxiety to see Miss Bannerleigh and make the acquaintance of her friends must be my excuse.\" \"We were equally anxious to make yours,\" he returned. \" The ladies will be home directly. You will find Miss Bannerleigh looking wonderfully better for the change of air and scene. We are quite proud of the improvement.\" \" She told me she was very well and happy,\" observed Max, whose attention was somewhat dis tracted between listening for the carriage-wheels and replying to his host's remarks. \" You have been in town for some time, have you not ?\" said Summerly. \" Yes, eight weeks altogether, \" You will be able to coach us up in all the latest events, then ? I suppose you have exhausted the theatres ?\" \" Most of them, I think,\" returned Max, smiling. \"For an idle man I have been working rather hard; the time passes more quickly \" \u2014 the feverish, restless look coming back into his eyes \u2014 \" when one keeps going. Q"], [234, "226 THE PLEASURE THAT'S ALMOST PAIN. \" We rather thought of going to a theatre to-night,\" said Summerly ; \"if you will tell us which piece is the best worth seeing, we will avail ourselves of your expe rience and patronise it. You will have dinner with us, of course ?\" \"Thank you!\" said Max gratefully; \"I shall be delighted.\" \"I expect by this time you have made so many friends, we are fortunate to find you have an evening disengaged.\" \" There is not a very great demand for my society,\" returned Max, smiling. \" All the better for us, Mr. Lyndern ; we may then hope to see you often.\" A carriage stopped at the door at last. Max's heart seemed almost to cease beating, and then go on furiously like a sledge-hammer, and nearly suffocate him. \" Here they are !\" said Summerly. Max never knew how the time passed before the drawing-room door opened. As a man in a dream he heard the gay tones of her voice ; they seemed to penetrate the mist that swam before him ; he heard her joyous laugh ; and then \u2014 then she was quite close to him iu all her flashing young beauty, and her little gloved hand lying in his. \" How glad I am to see you, Max !\" she said ; \" it seems such a long time since we saw each other, does not it ? I had no idea you would be here so early, or we would have returned sooner.\""], [235, "THE PLEASURE THAT'S ALMOST PAIN. 227 He never took his eyes from her face, but when he spoke he only made a conventional remark in an un natural voice. \" I am glad to see you looking so well,\" he said. Then he found himself shaking hands with Miss Summerly, and was dimly conscious she said some thing polite and kind, but he had no idea what \u2014 his whole mind was fixed upon Enid. She was standing before him, looking like a bright northern star. As she unbuttoned her glove she talked merrily all the time. \" I am afraid from your own account you have developed into a terribly dissipated individual,\" she said, looking at him ; \"it will require all my sobering influence to convert you. I am looking forward to lec turing you on participating too much in the frivolities of society.\" \" You are exactly the sort of person I should select for the purpose,\" laughed Mr. Summerly; \"dur ing the last two months the frivolities of society have possessed so little attraction for you.\" \" Never mind,\" returned Enid lightly; \" one must know something of the subject upon which one lec tures. Max will find I am tolerably well up in mine.\" \"Mr. Lyndern had better have some luncheon first, I think,\" said Miss Summerly, \"or he may not feel equal to the strain of fully attending to the subject.'' \" Ah, yes, perhaps he had,\" said Enid. All through luncheon she ran on in the same light way : her faultless costume, the jingling bangles on"], [236, "228 THE PLEASURE THAT'S ALMOST PAIN. her wrists, and her little conventional speeches all seemed to belong to this new dazzling Enid, and have no part with the sad-eyed, sorrowful girl who in her bsauty and utter desolation crept into his heart. She was acting a part, he told himself, keeping up this ridiculous farce that seemed to her \" such fun.\" Their meeting had been so terribly different from what he fancied it would be (when does such a meet ing ever come up to our expectations and ideas ?) ; it seemed so hard to see her sitting opposite to him laughing and talking as if he was an ordinary acquaint ance whom she was pleased to see again, instead of having her all to himself, his very own. Then Mr. Summerly entangled him in a political argument, and he had to give his attention to the sub ject until the meal came to an end. All the time the bangles jingled, making an accom pitniment to the dull pain in his heart. True to her now and always, he blamed himself, not her. \"I expected too much,\" be thought, \"I expected too much.\" \" Enid has a thousand things to tell you,\" said Miss Summerly, rising. \"I have ordered the carriage at half-past three ; in the mean time the library is quite at your disposal.\" \" Thank you,\" said Max gratefully. \" You do not think the lecture will be bad for you so soon after luncheon, do you ?\" asked Enid gaily ; \" because if you do, perhaps we had better postpone it for a little time.\""], [237, "THE PLEASURE THAT'S ALMOST PAIN. 229 She did not mean to be cruel, she did not know that every word she uttered in this light strain was to him simply torture most grievous to be borne, but the look in his eyes startled her, nevertheless, it was so full of piteous entreaty and tender reproach. \" Come,\" she said more seriously, and slipping her hand through his arm; \"lam dying to have a long talk with you.\" When they were alone he took her in his arms and kissed her passionately, kissed her as if it were a part ing embrace. \" What is it, Enid ?\" he asked hoarsely ; \" why are you so changed ?\" \"Changed! I did not know it,\" she said, raising her head from his shoulder, and looking at him in sur prise ; \" in what way am I changed ?\" \" In every way,\" he answered. \" That is very vague ; has my nose taken to turning up or my behaviour become frivolous ?\" \" Don't !\" he cried, with a shudder; \" can't you be serious for five minutes ?\" \" I think you are serious enough for both of us, don't you ?\" she asked, smiling, and passing her fingers lightly through his hair ; \" you give me the discourag ing impression that the change in me is decidedly for the worse.\" \" I fancied it would be all so different,\" said Max helplessly ; \" you used not to laugh at everything before you went away.\""], [238, "230 THE PLEASURE THAT'S ALMOST PAIN. \"Have I committed the indiscretion of coming back too happy ?\" said Enid. \" I dare say a few weeks' residence at the farm would reduce me to a commend able state of depression.\" \" Enid !\" he cried. \" 0 my child, I did not think you could be so cruel.\" \" What is the matter with you to-day, Max ?\" she said, kneeling down beside him ; \"it is so unlike you to find fault with me, you never used to do. If I have done anything wrong, I am sure I am very sorry. I have been looking forward so much to telling you of all my doings and about my book, and now you are cross with me.\" \" My darling, I am not in the least cross,\" he said wretchedly ; \"you know I am not, Enid. I like to see you happy and bright, but you must remember all those weary months, the thought of seeing you has been my one happiness. I have knocked about here and there simply to get through time, and make it go faster. I have lived in a sort of dream for the last few days, scarcely hearing anything but your voice or seeing anything but your face ; and ever since we have really met I have had the feeling I have made some gigantic mistake, and you only look upon me as an old friend.\" \" You did not expect me to make a great demon stration of affection before the Summerlys, surely?\" she said, a little unwilling feeling of self-reproach creeping into her heart; \" they would have thought I had gone mad. I am sure I made my greeting as"], [239, "THE PLEASURE THAT'S ALMOST PxVIN. 231 warm as I could. I wish you would tell me the par ticular fault of which you accuse me.\" \" My darling !\" he said, putting his arm round her and stroking her shining hair, \"I find no fault with you ; if I expected too much it is my fault, not yours, and for it I have been punished. You see, dear,\" with unconscious pathos in his voice, \" I am different from most people : I have never cared for any one before ; I have given you the first, best, strongest, and last love of my life. It does not seem much to you, Enid, but it is the best I had to give : you will do with it as you like.\" \"Max, you know I love you dearly,\" she said un easily ; \" but you knew from the first I could not love you like that. I told you the past was dead, and you said you were satisfied,\" a restless light suddenly coming into her eyes. \" The past is dead still, but that does not alter the fact that it once lived ; are you as satisfied to keep all I have left to give, as you were?\" \" Yes,\" he answered, in a low voice ; \" it is more than I ought to expect.\" \" I have a little favour to ask you, Max,\" she said coaxingly ; \" will you grant it ?\" With a great effort he tried to throw off the weight which oppressed him, and appear as bright as she. \" What is it ?\" he asked ; \" nothing very difficult, I hope?\" \" 0 no ; the easiest thing in the world,\" she an-"], [240, "232 THE PLEASURE THAT'S ALMOST PAIN. swered, with what seemed to him suppressed eagerness ; \"it is only a whim of mine. Promise that you will not oppose it.\" \" May I not have some idea to what rash promises I am binding myself?\" \" No ; I want you to show your confidence in me by promising blindly;\" her voice was still under con trol, but she could not hide the eagerness in her eyes. \" I promise,\" he said. \" Well, it is this : I want to keep our engagement a secret until next Friday : only a week longer, Max ; I \u2014 I do wish it so very much.\" Her words fell like lead on his heart ; it took him a minute to recover the blow. \" Have you fully considered what an unnecessarily false position you are placing us both in ?\" he asked. \"You take a most mistaken view of the case,\" she cried eagerly. \" The Summerlys have no claim what ever to be made acquainted with my private affairs ; they are neither my parents nor guardians ; I am simply visiting them. Surely one need not go about labelled ' Engaged ' if one does not like !\" \" But, Enid, there can be no earthly reason to delay either the announcement of our engagement or our marriage, that I can discover.\" \" Let me have this season in town with the Sum merlys ?\" she said pleadingly. \"I promised them I would. I will be married quite early in the autumn, if you wish it, and tell every one I am publicly disposed of next week.\""], [241, "THE PLEASURE THAT'S ALMOST PAIN. 233 The old pained look in his eyes grew deeper, but he did not speak. \" You will consent ?\" she asked, after a pause. \"I have promised,\" he answered. She gave a little gasp of relief. \"Now, I want to tell you about my book,\" she said, with an obvious desire to change the subject. \" It is to come out in two vols. The second I wrote while I was at Mentone, so you see I was not idle. Mr. Sum merly thinks it will be a success, which is decidedly satisfactory. It is now in the publisher's hands. I would not write about it, because I wanted to tell you myself.\" \" I am delighted to hear it will soon be out,\" re turned Max, with a ghastly attempt at a smile ; but it was such a failure he turned away his head that she might not see it. \" Several people are good enough to say they want to read it,\" continued Enid, the excitement coming into her eyes again. Max had never seen that look in them before to-day. It puzzled him a good deal ; it be longed so thoroughly to this new Enid, whom as yet he did not quite understand. \" I suppose, after all, I have nothing very new to tell you about Mentone,\" she said, after a pause, and with a fluttering sigh. \" It was all very pleasant and diverting \u2014 almost too pleasant, I think.\" \" Your letters left no room for doubt that you were happy,\" returned Max. \" When we are married you shall go back again, if you like.\""], [242, "234 THE PLEASURE THAT'S ALMOST PAIN. The lustre in her eyes grew dim. \"No,\" she said sadly, shaking her head, \" it never answers to repeat a successful experiment ; the chances are the repetition proves a failure, things can never be quite so pleasant again. It is not possible ; the sense of missing the past prevents one from appreciating the joys of the present ; the people have gone, and the place is changed in consequence.\" \" You mean being there with me would not make you so happy as being there with other people ?\" he said bitterly. \" Max,\" she cried reproachfully, \" that is a very unkind speech. I should be happy anywhere with you, of course,\" with an effort ; \" but you must acknowledge the sea is not made of one wave or the beach of one pebble : each wave and each pebble go towards making the whole, and no place can be so perfect with one person in it, whom you know, as with a dozen.\" \" Have you always thought so ?\" Once more the excitable look came into her eyes. \" I don't know. Perhaps I never had such a good opportunity of forming an opinion on the subject before.\" The answer was unsatisfactory, and they both knew it. It was a relief when Miss Summerly came in. \" The carriage will be round in five minutes,\" she said. \" If you will come with us, Mr. Lyndern, we shall be delighted ; we will promise to set you down at your hotel in good time to dress for dinner.\""], [243, "CHAPTER XXX. FACE TO FACE AT LAST The reflection that we have attempted anything great or small, and miserably failed in accomplishing it, is by no means a satisfactory one ; it humiliates our pride, ruffles our temper, and has the additionally un pleasant effect of disgusting us with ourselves and the world in general. In this discouraging frame of mind Maxwell Lyndern returned to his hotel. The hope he had cherished of becoming brilliant and light-hearted by his two months' training in London society was dashed to the ground. His interview with Enid had proved very unsatisfactory. Instead of laughing when she laughed, he had depressed her, even found fault with her because she was so gay. Poor little happy Enid ! what a contrast she must have found him to the men of her own world, with whom she had been lately associating ! No wonder she thought of the pleasures of Mentone as preferable to the prospect of solitude with him. Every moment his self-condemnation grew more severe, till he appeared a perfect brute in his own eyes, and Enid an injured angel. It was the nature of the man to reproach himself, and make excuses for her; his very nobleness made him take the side of the weak against the strong : it always had been, and it always would be so to the end."], [244, "236 FACE TO FACE AT LAST. As he went into his room, with the firm intention to be the merriest of the party that night, in spite of everything, the sweet scent from a bouquet of Gloire de Dijon roses and violets greeted him. Ah ! how vividly it brought back to his mind the first time he saw Enid! Once again he seemed to see the comfortless room, the scanty fire, the broken jam-pot on the table with the bunch of violets in it ; he could almost bear the wind whistling through the cracked pane in the window. What a change had taken place since then ! He ordered the bouquet as a present for Enid, and until now he had forgotten the circumstance. He felt very glad he had ordered it now ; perhaps it might remind her of the little bunch of violets he sent her by old Wallace, the little bunch that she fastened in the bosom of her dress a y7ear ago. When he arrived at Empress Gate, he found Enid and the Summerly s awaiting him in the drawing-room. He had so lectured and schooled himself to banish as much as possible any traces of his late disappointment, that he succeeded far better than he expected. Enid was dressed in some soft gray costume, which suited her to perfection. Max had never seen her in an evening-dress before, and her beauty seemed to strike him in a new light, in consequence. The white ness of her neck and arms contrasted with the jet ornaments, and the broad band of black velvet round her throat. She was sitting in a low chair by the fire,"], [245, "237 FACE TO FACE AT LAST. using the feather fan in her hand more as a plaything than a screen. As he entered the room a ringing laugh met him, and then she turned her head. \"Ah, Max,\" she said, \" we were talking of you.\" \" Were you?\" he returned; \" I hope you found the topic entertaining.\" \" I was asking Miss Bannerleigh what you would think of a man who broke his word,\" said Mr. Summerly. \" That would entirely depend upon circumstances,\" said Max. Then turning to Enid, \" I have brought you some of your old friends ; I hope the gay flowers you have been among lately have not put you out of love with these ?\" \" How good of you to remember my weakness !\" she said. \" No flowers, however splendid, can put me out of love with violets.\" \" Not even orange-blossoms ?\" asked Miss Sum- merly. Something in her tone made Max look quickly at Enid. Her head was bent over the flowers, but in spite of that, he could see the flood of colour which came into her face ; when she raised her eyes, there was the same excitable look in them he noticed in the afternoon. \" Not even orange-blossoms,\" she repeated un steadily : her voice played her false as well as her face. She gave a little impatient gesture, and changed the subject abruptly. \"I did not feel myself competent to give an opinion on the subject of your conscientious convictions,\" she"], [246, "238 FACE TO FACE AT LAST. said ; \" you came exactly at the right time to answer for yourself : under what circumstances do you consider a man justified in breaking his word ?\" \" Did I say he would be justified under any ?\" asked Max, smiling. \" You implied that the course of circumstances might considerably lessen bis guilt : perhaps you might be disposed to view his case with more leniency, if the temptation had been very great,\" laughed Sum merly. \" I think it right to inform you I am consider ably interested in your reply.\" \" I don't think the strength of temptation much excuse,\" returned Max ;\" it is an admission of your own weakness.\" Enid rose and went to the table, keeping her back to them. When she turned round there was a bright glitter in her eyes, and a smile on her lips that gave Max the uncomfortable impression of unreality. She clapped her hands softly together with a little dramatic gesture that was a trifle overdone. \" Max's word is his bond,\" she said ; \"wild horses would not make him break it. You had better confess your sins at once ; the longer you delay, the harder you will find it.\" \" I am afraid I have no excuse to plead but the strength of temptation,\" said Summerly. \" The fact is, Mr. Lyndern, I told you to-day I would abide by your decision as to the selection of our evening's amuse ment, and temptation, in the person of Miss Banner leigh, has led me utterly astray, and induced me to"], [247, "239 FACE TO FACE AT LAST. break my word by acting entirely independent of you, and taking a box at the Frivolity. Put yourself in my place, and say if the temptation was not a powerful one.\" Mr. Summerly looked at his guest a little question ingly; Max looked at Enid. \" Yes,\" he answered ,in alow voice, \" it was a very powerful one.\" \" One which I should plead as justification for even a greater fault,\" continued Summerly. \" Do you think if you had been in my place you would have resisted it?\" \"I am not good at resisting things at all,\" answered Max, as lightly as he could. \" When I begin to exer cise the virtue, I shall not select Enid as a subject on whom to try the experiment ; the chances are I should fail, and give it up in disgust.\" For the second time Enid changed the subject. She left the table, and returned to her chair by the fire. \"How is Hannah?\" she inquired; \"how remiss of me not to ask after her before ! I believe she looked upon me as the family banshee, and I had an uncom fortable feeling that there was some truth in the idea. Is she still as mysterious and prophetic as she used to be?\" \"Quite, I think,\" answered Max, with difficulty suppressing a shudder at the recollection of the old servant's words on the night of Enid's departure : \" You made the first great mistake in your life when you, let her come here, and the second when you let her go away.\""], [248, "240 FACE TO FACE AT LAST. Even now the truth of them seemed apparent to him in the restless excitability of this new gay Enid, and the unreality of her laugh. All through dinner it was the same. Max was terribly angry with himself whenever he became con scious that he was critically listening to her, and trying to discover how much of her mirth was real ; there seemed a sort of treachery in endeavouring to find her out. When he wrapped her shawl round her preparatory to getting into the carriage, he said, \"lam glad you chose the theatre to-night, instead of my doing so ; the piece at the Frivolity is very good. You must not compare our London amusements un favourably with those of Mentone.\" \" I could not compare them ; they are so utterly different,\" she returned. \"Have you heard a very favourable report of this piece ?\" he asked. \"I? \u2014 0 no,\" she answered confusedly \u2014 \"that is, some one mentioned it to-day as being good, and \u2014 and I had a fancy for seeing it in consequence. I suppose we shall see everything in the course of time ; it is only a question of precedence.\" She was very quiet during the drive. Only when the light from the street-lamps flashed into the carriage as whirl n ; s1 them did he clearly see her face; generally her bouquet was raised to it, but the pathetic look in her eyes, which the friendly darkness hid except at these intervals, struck him like a revelation, and"], [249, "FACE TO FACE AT LAST. 241 convinced him more than ever that her gaiety was as sumed. Even as the carriage stopped she laughed again. \" Has it ever struck you what absurd creatures of impulse wo are ?\" she said, turning to Summerly. \"We are, at the present moment, in a state of internal hilarity, for no particular reason that I can discover but the idea that we are going to be amused ; probably before half an hour is over we shall be sniffing behind our pocket-handkerchiefs at a pathetic piece of acting, and glancing furtively around with the view of discover ing if our neighbours are similarly affected. It is all impulse, after all, it is not real feeling ; no one is quite real, I think; it is so much easier to be artificial.\" \" Do you speak from experience ?\" ' \" When my time comes, I have no doubt I shall act my little part,\" she answered evasively, and laying her hand on his arm ; \"when it does I will tell you. ' All the world's a stage,' you know, ' and men and women are but players.' If Shakespeare had lived now, how terribly he would have seen through most of us, and exposed our little deceptions ! On the whole we may congratulate ourselves upon the fact that he does not.\" The curtain was up for the first act as they entered the box ; Miss Summerly and Max were already there ; before they were seated the piece began. Max took up his position a little at the back of the box. He had seen the piece before, and his great de sire was to look at Enid. She was watching the pro- R"], [250, "242 FACE TO FACE AT LAST. gress of the play with a degree of interest which came as a relief to him ; he was beginning to fancy so few things really interested her, and her praise and laughter but sacrifices offered at the shrine of the goddess So ciety. Nothing that she did escaped him : her natural appreciation of the dramatic was powerfully brought out by the play ; it touched her sensitive nature, and brought the tears into her eyes. When the curtain fell, she turned to Max with a little gasp. \"It is a clever piece,\" she said; \"are you not anxious for the next act to begin ?\" He smiled. \" I am glad you like it,\" he said. Before he could add more, Enid, who had transferred her gaze to the audience, gave a start, and then fixed her eyes on the opposite box. Max saw this, as he saw everything else. It contained a lady and two gentle men ; the lady was delicate-looking, and very fair. She was dressed in a high black velvet dress, which suited her to perfection ; a diamond butterfly flashed from her hair. The gentleman standing immediately behind her had gray hair, and looked at least twenty years older than she. The third occupant of the box was very handsome, very indolent, very attractive. He looked essentially a \" man about town ;\" every movement ele gant and unstudied. Max noticed the peculiarly gentle, almost caressing, way he had of bending his head towards the lady beside him, that he might hear what she was saying. \" Is not that Colonel and Mrs. Welton ?\" asked Miss Summerly, turning to her brother."], [251, "FACE TO FACE AT LAST. 243 \" By Jove ! so it is; I must go and speak to them,\" he exclaimed. Max saw the bouquet in Enid's hand tremble, and the feverish light in her eyes increase ; but otherwise she commanded herself admirably. She was still look ing at the Welton's box, when suddenly the eyes of the gentleman opposite met her own \u2014 met in one long stead fast look. It seemed to Max to last for an eternity, and turn him to stone. Almost deaf and blind, he heard himself speak mechanically, just as he might have heard any one else ; he had not the faintest idea what he said. The scent of the violets almost suffocated him, and a terrible feeling of numbness came over his mind and body. He became conscious, after a time, of a little gloved hand resting on his arm, and Enid's voice. \" Are you ill, Max ? you look so pale.\" \" No,\" he answered, in a hollow voice, and then looked at her with an awful despair in his eyes. \" I am quite well.\" \"Mr. Vanlyn is coming to speak to us, Enid,\" said Miss Summerly, who had been exchanging friendly glances with the occupants of the opposite box; \"I thought by what he said this morning we should see him here to-night.\" Then she turned to Max. \" Colonel and Mrs. Welton are such charming people,\" she said by way of explanation ; \"we met them at Mentone, and Mr. Vanlyn also. Of course, Enid told you about meeting Mr. Vanlyn again ; was it not curious ?\" \"I did not hear of it,\" said Max dully."], [252, "244 SHE NEED NOT HAVE DONE THAT. \" 0, I thought you would have been sure to do so,\" she said ; \" be is quite an old friend of Enid's, and he happened to come to Mentone when we were there, so of course they renewed their acquaintance : he is a most agreeable man, quite an acquisition. I hope we shall see something of him this season. Did you not tell me you first met him at Shinglebeach a year last July or August, Enid ?\" \"Shinglebeach, August 3rd. O love ! O fire ! once he drew With one long kiss my whole soul through My lips, as sunlight drinketh dew.\" The words ran mockingly, madly in Max's ears ; they fought and tumbled over each other in his brain ; the whole theatre seemed filled by the torturing jingle of them ; for he knew that as surely as death follows life, and as night day, so surely had he come face to face with that man at last. CHAPTER XXXI. \" SHE NEED NOT HAVE DONE THAT.\" \"I feel highly flattered that you so far honoured me by taking my advice and coming here to-night,\" said Vanlyn, addressing Miss Summerly ; and after hav ing exchanged introductory bows with Max, seated himself beside Enid. \"Your opinion carried great weight with Miss"], [253, "245 SHE NEED NOT HAVE DONE THAT. Bannerleigh,\" she returned; \" it was the effect of it, I think, which made her express such a strong wish to come here.\" \" Was it ?\" he asked, in a low musical voice, and bending his handsome head towards Enid as he spoke in the old caressing way. \" I don't know,\" she returned, without raising her eyes from the violets ; \" there did not seem any special inducement to go elsewhere.\" \" Was there one to come here ?\" \" You said you had heard the piece highly spoken of,\" she said; \"that was the inducement, I suppose.\" He did not answer, but with a calm air of proprietor ship took her bouquet from her hand. \"What charming flowers !\" he said, speaking just loud enough for the others to hear him; \"there is a degree of simplicity about them which is really re freshing.\" Mr. Vanlyn had a very shrewd guess by whom the bouquet was given. \" Please do not be satirical at the expense of my favourite flowers,\" said Enid, with a feverish laugh that she tried vainly to make natural. \" Your favourite flowers !\" he repeated, still contem plating them ; \" I think they must be mine too. Why should you suspect me of satire ? I feel a growing pre sentiment that very soon I shall become as devoted to violets as you are, and even prefer them to poppies or Mentone orange-blossom.\" He raised his eyes to Enid's for a second, and then"], [254, "246 SHE NEED NOT HAVE DONE THAT. turned to Miss Summerly and began discussing the piece. Shinglebeach, kisses, orange-blossom ; the jumble of them in Max's head was positively awful, and the noise of the music \u2014 the terrible music that seemed as if it would never come to an end ! He found himself in cluded in the conversation, and became conscious he was talking of London doings, of a clever speech made in the House last night, of the possible winner of the Derby, and other subjects of public interest. At last Mr. Summerly came back, and Vanlyn rose. \" If the Weltons leave before the piece is over, perhaps I shall see you again,\" he said, addressing Miss Summerly and looking at Enid ; \"if not, may I hope to have the pleasure in the Row. to-morrow ?\" \" I have nothing to ride,\" said Enid, with a ring of disappointment in her voice and an unconsciously piteous look in her eyes. \"I have brought your horse up,\" said Max; \"I thought perhaps you might like to have it.\" \" 0, thank you !\" she cried gratefully. \" Then, after all,\" turning to Laurence Vanlyn, \" perhaps wo may see you in the Row to-morrow.\" He made a graceful little bow and looked down at her, smiling. \"Au revoir,\" he said ; and a few minutes afterwards he appeared in his old place again, beside the lady with the diamonds in her hair. The piece had lost its interest for Enid: she leaned languidly back, and cast furtive glances across the"], [255, "SHE NEED NOT HAVE DONE THAT. 247 theatre ; but Laurence Vanlyn seemed always to be discussing something of deep interest with his com panion, while the gray-haired Colonel contemplated tbo leading actress through his opera-glasses. Before the close of the third act they went, and Enid's heart beat almost to suffocation ; the intense excitement made her face colourless. Max saw it all and read it aright ; there was no fool's paradise open to him now : it seemed years since he heard the gate close with a bang, and he knew it was closed for ever : hope, happiness, life were inside; he was out. \"Ah, Vanlyn, your friends did not stay till the end,\" said Mr. Summerly. \" Mrs. Welton is so delicate she soon gets tired,\" was the reply ; at last the dreadful piece came to an end. \" If you will bring the ladies, I will go and hurry up the carriage,\" said Mr. Summerly. \" I think this is Miss Summerly's,\" said Vanlyn, calmly handing a woollen wrap to Max ; and then he turned to Enid and offered her bis arm. It was all done so quietly, so as a matter of course, that Max had not the ghost of an alternative but to offer his to Miss Summerly. Vanlyn drew back a step and made another bow, which said as plainly as words could speak, \" You first.\" When they reached the door Summerly and the carriage were waiting ; Laurence Vanlyn and Miss Bannerleigh were not. In a minute or two they appeared. Enid was laughing, and her companion bending down and talking."], [256, "248 A BITTER REVENGE. \" Good-bye, Max,\" she said, giving him her hand ; \" I shall expect to see you and Fleetfoot at twelve o'clock to-morrow.\" And then, amid the bustle and confusion of cabs and carriages, they drove off, and turning round, he found Mr. Vanlyn beside him. \"Are you driving or walking?\" asked Laurence carelessly. \"Driving.\" \" Then I will say good-night.\" \"Good-night,\" returned Max mechanically; and then, as Vanlyn turned away, Max Lyndern half stag gered back, and with difficulty suppressed the cry which rose to his lips. In addition to the white flowers which adorned Mr. Vanlyn's buttonhole there was now a little bunch of violets. \" 0 my God !\" he said to himself, \" she need not have done that, she need not have done that !\" CHAPTER XXXII. A BITTER REVENGE Enid Bannerleigh was putting the finishing touches to her toilet, and tucking into her habit a hand kerchief with a gay border round it, when her maid brought her a card. It was Maxwell Lyndern's. She"], [257, "249 A BITTER REVENGE. took it, and glanced carelessly at it and at the words written in pencil beneath his name. \" I want to talk to you about business. Can you spare me a few minutes this morning before our ride ?\" \" Tell Mr. Lyndern I will be with him directly,\" she said, and then rearranged the handkerchief to better advantage before she went down. \" He wants to see me about investing that money,\" she thought ; \" poor Max, how kind and good he is, always thinking of me and my happiness !\" She went down-stairs humming a song, and with the restless light in her eyes that sleep had not banished. He was standing beside the table when she came in, with a book in his hand. He closed the book, and laid it on the table, advancing towards her. \" How do you do ?\" she said, giving her attention to the button of her glove ; and then she looked up at Max, and a startled cry rose to her lips. \" 0 Max ! how terribly ill you look !\" she said, \" and your hand is as cold as ice ; what is the matter?\" \" Nothing,\" he answered, smiling bitterly. \"I am quite well. I have been trying to work out a problem, and the exertion has proved a little fatiguing, that is all.\" \" What is it ?\" she asked, still regarding him with startled eyes; \"I am sure something very bad has happened. Do tell me what it is ; have you lost all your money or your best friend ?\" \" Make your mind easy,\" he answered ; \"my worldly prospects are in an eminently satisfactory condition.\""], [258, "250 A BITTER REVENGE. \" And your best friend ?\" \" My best friend is in an eminently satisfactory condition also.\" \" You have been knocking yourself up,\" she said ; \" perhaps the heat of the theatre was too much for you last night.\" \" Perhaps it was.\" \" A canter in the Row will do you good ; are the horses here ? I want to see Fleetfoot.\" \" They will be here in half an hour,\" he returned, suddenly looking at her; \"I want to talk to you a little before we start.\" \" 0,\" she said disappointedly, \" I \u2014 I thought we should have started earlier ; I am afraid we shall miss our friends.\" \" At what time did you tell Mr. Vanlyn you should be there ?\" Very quietly, very gently he spoke ; there was no bitterness left in his voice, and only a great pathos in his eyes. Enid did not see it ;. she turned away and put a fern-leaf, in the vase on the table, a little further into the water. \" About half-past twelve;\" her answer was low and a trifle unsteady. \"I do not think you need be afraid of missing him,\" said Max ; and then he looked away again at the fire. \" Why did you not mention having met Mr. Vanlyn at Mentone, Enid ?\" \"Did I not mention it? I do not know any par ticular reason why I should,\" she answered, in the same"], [259, "251 A BITTER REVENGE. tone, and keeping her back to him. \"You did not know him, consequently his doings would not have been interesting to you.\" \" It is very pleasant to meet an old friend,\" said Max. \" Yes, very pleasant.\" She turned round, and came up to him with the feverish look in her eyes and a bright spot on each cheek. \" I will tell you all about it if you like,\" she said excitedly. \"One evening we were in the hotel garden listening to the band. I had wandered off on my own account quite away from the others. The music sounded faintly in the distance, and the scent of the flowers brought back old memories, so I sat down to think. Don't you know how sometimes those recollections seem crowded into one's brain, and one lives the past over again ? Well, on that evening the old Shinglebeach days came very vividly back to me, and I said Mr. Vanlyn's name aloud ; and then the most remarkable thing happened : he answered me. I thought at first it was a trick of my imagination ; but directly I saw him I knew it was not.\" She gave a gasp, as if the scene she had been describing was actually then happening, and brought herself back to realities once more. \" Of course the whole thing was quite easy and natural to explain. Mr. Vanlyn was recruiting in readi ness for the fatigues of the coming season, and fixed on Mentone as the pleasantest place for the pur pose.\" \" Afterwards Mr. Vanlyn helped you to revive your old recollections, I suppose ?\""], [260, "252 A BITTER REVENGE. \"0 yes !\" she answered dreamily; \"we often talked of the Shinglebeach days \u2014 \" There was a pause ; then Max Lyndern's great love \u2014 the love which was the strongest influence of his life \u2014 won the victory. In that moment every thought of bitterness died : it must have been so because his nature was one of self-sacrifice ; he knew long ago he was hers, body and soul ; he had said there was no limit to his love, and he was right. The time had come to prove it; the gold was cast in the \" furnace of living pain.\" He knew the furnace was fierce, but he never shrank or wavered ; his best, his dearest, his all was demanded of him, and he gave it absolutely, withholding nothing. He could do no more. They were standing before the fire : he stretched out his hands towards her, and drew her to him. \"Poor little girl,\" he said compassionately, \" did you care for him so very much ?\" He could feel her hands trembling in his ; he forced himself to look at her ; it was only another stab through his heart, and he bore the pain unflinchingly, for her sake. \" Yes,\" she answered, in a low voice, \" I suppose I did \u2014 but it is all over and ended now ; I don't know why we got upon the subject.\" \" I came on purpose to speak of it,\" he said. \" I knew a long time ago that you had cared for some one, and last night I found out who it was.\" \" Did you ?\" she asked quickly, and looked back again at the fire."], [261, "253 A BITTER REVENGE. \"Enid,\" he cried suddenly, \" I want you to tell me that at the time you became engaged to me you did not intend to renew your old relations with that man if you should chance to meet him ; I have believed you so perfect and so good, and I want to believe you so still ; it is terribly hard to lose everything at once.\" \"I never thought I should see him again as long as I lived,\" she said, \" and I am not likely ever to renew my old relations with him. After he left me at Shinglebeach I knew the happiest chapter in my life had come to an end, and I made up my mind to the inevitable. When we met at Mentone I could not resist having a little revenge for all I bad suffered. It was very wrong, was not it ? I think I made him care a little for me before we came away.\" \" And you still care for him ?\" said Max huskily. She did not answer. \" Tell me,\" he said ; \" I would rather know.\" \" I suppose it is not possible to be quite indifferent to a person whom one has loved as I loved Laurence Vanlyn,\" she answered; \"perhaps I thought I had lived down the old pain more completely than I had.\" She spoke slowly, dreamily, thinking little of Max, much of Laurence Vanlyn. \" You found when you met that you cared for him as much as ever,\" he said, facing the truth bravely. \" It does not matter,\" she returned sadly ; \" do not let us talk of it. Perhaps my revenge singed my wings a little, but all that is over now. Next week he will hear I am engaged to you ; that will be the end of"], [262, "254 A BITTER REVENGE. everything. After all,\" with a pathetic smile, \" it is not a very exciting play, is it ? Just a case of diamond cut diamond, and then the clash of wedding-bells, and bride-cake, and \u2014 the end.\" Max shuddered. \" Wedding-bells and bride-cake,\" he repeated; \" yes, that will be the end of it.\" She smiled again, and laid her hand on his arm. \"Please do not shudder at the prospect, it is not complimentary.\" \"I do not want to be complimentary,\" said Max; \" I want to look the truth steadily in the face. All last night I was looking at it, and learning to get used to the idea of seeing you married to him ; it was not easy.\" He spoke so wearily, as if the struggle had worn him out ; spoke quite hopelessly, too, and his voice was very low. \" You are going to give me up, Max,\" said the girl, trying to bide the eagerness in her voice. \" I do not want you to do that. I have no right to ask it. You have been so unselfishly good to me, I will do my very best to make you happy. I have hid nothing from you, and if you are content with me as I am, I will keep my promise.\" \" Enid,\" he said gently, \" I do not want you to hate me. I hope as long as I live we shall be friends. What would you think of a man who loved himself and his own happiness more than yours ? Do you think my love is so weak and puny a thing that I could"], [263, "255 A BITTER REVENGE. accept such a sacrifice at your hands ? My dear, my dear, how little you know me!\" Ah ! how little indeed ! There was that in his soul which was beyond her comprehension. She loved Laurence Vanlyn, she had deliberately spoiled her life because of him ; she had looked at everything with jaundiced eyes, and made up her mind that her happi ness had come to an end with the old days at Shingle beach ; she nursed her grief until it became part of her, a sort of exquisite pain and a luxury on which to feed her thoughts. But Max Lyndern was different. Enid's happiness was his earth and his heaven, his past, present, and future ; he desired nothing beyond. He knew that her happiness meant now his own unutter able misery ; he knew he must laugh and talk and be merry for Enid's sake \u2014 the luxury of grief was denied him : he had but to endure and be strong as long as the burden of life was laid on him. That was the future Maxwell Lyndern had to look forward to. \"Do not look so miserable,\" she said, with a throb of pity at her heart ; \" if you insist upon giving me up, of course I cannot help it. After a time you will see some one ten times more worthy of you than I am, and I hope and think you will be happy. I can never for get your generosity and goodness to me. Will you promise that this shall make no difference to our friendship, and that you will come and see me very often ?\" \"It will make no difference,\" he returned; \" nothing ever can.\""], [264, "256 THE DIE IS CAST. There was another pause ; then the clock on the chimney-piece struck the half-hour. Enid started. \" How late the horses are !\" she said. That was the end of Max Lyndern's dream : the agony which he was enduring had completely passed out of her mind, and been replaced by the trivial thought of a chance meeting with her lover in the Row. Perhaps her remark made him realise more clearly than anything else how little she had really cared for him. CHAPTER XXXIII. THE DIE IS CAST For a whole week Max absented himself from Empress Gate. He resorted to the subterfuge of inventing business engagements\u2014 anything he could think of which would keep him apart from Enid until he could be certain of having himself well in hand. Probably when he next visited the Summerlys he would hear that Enid was engaged to Laurence Vanlyn ; it was even possible he might meet him there, and have to talk to Mr. and Miss Summerly while the lovers talked to each other in soft under tones, after the way of lovers generally. At the end of a week the restlessness which had taken possession of Max defied resistance, and he made up his mind to call at Empress Gate, and hear if any-"], [265, "257 THE DIE IS CAST. thing was definitely settled. Suspense had become unbearable ; certainty, be thought, however bad, was preferable, and deep down in his heart there remained the undying craving to see Enid again. She had become so closely interwoven with his life and his every thought that to be apart from her was more existence than life. He thought he clearly realised how he had connected her with everything he did and planned, and what a terrible blank his life must be without her, now he had turned bis back for ever on the poor old farm and all the associations of his youth. It was Sunday afternoon when he called at the Summerlys'. He found Enid in the drawing-room alone. She was sitting at the window when he was announced, and turned, with a startled gesture, as the door opened. \" How long it seems since I saw you, Max !\" she said, advancing to meet him, and holding out her hand. \" I have been wondering what had become of you.\" \"I have been occupied,\" he returned nervously. \" You have not wanted me ?\" \" Indeed I have ; and if we had not been in a perfect whirl of gaiety, I should have wanted you still more. The confession is additionally humiliating be cause it is true.\" \"You are very good,\" he said, with terribly exag gerated lightness. \" It sounds like a society sentiment. I am glad it possesses the unusual and flattering s"], [266, "258 THE DIE IS CAST. distinction of being sincere. Have you wanted me for anything important ? Have you any news to tell me?\" She knew quite well what news he meant. \" Yes,\" she answered. \" You have been very kind and generous to me, and I would rather tell you it than that any one else should. I \u2014 I am engaged to Mr. Vanlyn.\" He had been expecting it for days, and yet from her lips it came as a blow. He knew then that he had never quite realised what it would be, by the numb, dead feeling that seemed sapping his strength away. He must speak, he knew that ; he must wish her hap piness in the usual way ; yet somehow the words would not come. After a minute he spoke, and listened anxiously as he did so to discover if his voice sounded very strange. \" And you are happy ?\" he said. She looked dreamily at a rose she was holding in her hand. \" 0 yes,\" she said softly. \" I am afraid to think of it ; there is something terrible in being as happy as I am. So very few people are \u2014 for long ; and yet I cannot, I will not face the possibility of ever being less so.\" \"I hope you never may be,\" he said. \"It is a grand thing to be perfectly happy. Most people miss happiness altogether in its completeness.\" \"Better so than having known it to lose it.\" She was thinking only of herself, and for the time wholly forgot that he had had and lost it."], [267, "THE DIE IS CAST. 259 \" I think not,\" he said. \" You see, one has always the past to call one's own. No future or pre sent can deprive us of it ; it is our own absolutely, and sometimes the possession is worth living and dying for.\" \" My present happiness far exceeds anything I have known in the past, anything I ever dreamed of,\" she said. He fancied he was past feeling anything, and it was a shock to him that her last remark made him flinch. The fact that she could talk to him in this way struck him very forcibly after their previous relations towards each other. She seemed to have completely forgotten them. It was an additional proof of how little she had really cared for him. He was glad when Miss Summerly joined them ; and after a little time he made an excuse, and went away. He wandered about restlessly for some time, and then went into his club and lighted a cigar. He had no desire now to be alone. He dare not stop to think at present, so he sat down near a group of men whom he knew by sight, and looked out of the window. \" So Vanlyn has done it at last,\" said one of them \u2014 the nearest to Maxwell Lyndern. He turned his head ; every word reached him with painful dis tinctness now. \" What do you mean ?\" asked another. \" 0, have you not heard ? He has managed to get engaged to the new authoress every one is talking"], [268, "260 THE DIE IS CAST. about \u2014 Miss Bannerleigh, you know. She has a lot of cash, they say, independent of her writing altogether ; it will set poor old Don Juan on his legs again, for a time at least.\" \" If report is reliable, the result of last year's Derby forced him into the outstretched arms of the children of Israel.\" \"Don Juan does not strike me as being, strictly speaking, a marrying man,\" said the first speaker. They all laughed \u2014 all but Max. \" If Vanlyn pays another visit to Monte Carlo, he will considerably lighten the weight of Miss Banner leigh's burden of riches. They say he dropped a few thousands last time he was there.\" \" There are two or three people who will have something to say to him on the subject of matrimony, I fancy.\" \"Very likely.\" The topic changed, and Max left the room. He had heard more than enough to make him terribly anxious. Something must be done ; but what ? and by whom ? His hands were securely tied. Anything which he might think it absolutely necessary for Enid to know before she took the irrevocable step of binding herself to Laurence Vanlyn for life it was impossible for him to tell her, because she would impute to him prejudiced, and possibly interested, motives. And yet she must be told. He thought over the matter carefully during the long sleepless night, and came to"], [269, "261 THE DIE IS CAST. the conclusion that Mr. Summerly was the only person who could undertake the unenviable task ; and to Mr. Summerly he went, as early as he could decently pre sent himself at Empress Gate. Max struck him as looking very worn and tired, and his voice sounded anxious. \" I came to speak to you about Vanlyn,\" he said, coming somewhat abruptly to the subject after the usual salutations. \" I heard his name mentioned at my club last night. He was not spoken of with much respect. Have you heard anything about him which Miss Bannerleigh ought to know ?\" \"Nothing serious against him,\" returned Sum merly meditatively, \" except that he is extravagant. Most young men about town live up to their incomes. Vanlyn is a great favourite with people generally.\" Max rose and walked absently to the window, keeping his back to his companion. \" They were speaking last night of Vanlyn's marriage as a means of delivering him out of the hands of the Jews,\" he said. \" He seems to have acquired the ques tionable honour of being called Don Juan, and to spend some of his leisure time at Monte Carlo. He also seems to have lost a considerable sum of money on the Derby. If these things are true, I think my cousin ought to know them.\" \" So do I,\" returned Summerly; \" but who is to tell her?\" \" Will you tell her ?\" asked Max, catching his breath."], [270, "262 THE DIE IS CAST. \" She has known Vanlyn as long as I have,\" he replied. \" She would not believe anything against him. They met at Shinglebeach two years ago, and I saw the beginning of the whole affair. It was inevitable from the first. She was so pretty and innocent and fresh, and he was disgusted with most things, and tired for the time of the world of fashion. He took the trouble to fascinate Mr. Bannerleigh and myself, and then be improved the occasion by fascinating Enid too. It was a very easy and pleasant amusement for him. I never knew how the last chapter ended, but when I saw her again she never spoke of Laurence Vanlyn. When they met at Mentone, I could see she was fight ing desperately hard against something that was in her heart. She laughed very often in a forced unmusical way ; she scarcely ever looked at him, for fear her eyes should betray her, I think; and yet, all the time, in spite of herself, the old power was at work. Do you think when she has cared for him so long that a gossiping story told in a club-room will carry much weight with her ?\" \"What I heard ought to have weight with her.\" Mr. Summerly smiled. \"If you loved any one as she loves him,\" he said, \" do you think a bit of gossip would affect you ?\" Max turned round with a desperate light in his eyes. \" Then you think we ought to let her marry him in ignorance of his real character?\" he said. \"Even supposing we could reconcile our consciences to it,"], [271, "263 THE DIE IS CAST. don't you think we should be laying ourselves open to grave reproach in the future ?\" \" She is so happy,\" said Summerly, with a sigh, \" it seems almost cruel. Besides, I think we ought to find out if these things are really true ; you know how people exaggerate.\" \" How are we to find out?\" \" It would not be difficult,\" he returned. It was not. Most people knew Laurence Vanlyn, and liked him. Ladies said he was so handsome and amusing, and had such charming manners ; and gen tlemen, that \" poor old Don Juan was a jolly fellow : that when he was in form he lived fourteen days a week, and as long as he had any tin he knew how to spend it.\" Then Summerly called on Dr. Froom. That gen tleman was not to be drawn. He knew nothing either to the credit or discredit of Mr. Vanlyn \u2014 he thought him a pleasant fellow. Summerly conned the matter carefully over, and then determined to speak to Laurence Vanlyn himself on the subject. He broached it as they sat smoking in the evening after the ladies had gone to bed. \"I feel after a fashion responsible for Miss Ban nerleigh's happiness,\" he said. \" I was a friend of her father's \u2014 \" Laurence Vanlyn interrupted him with a light laugh. \"Don't distress yourself,\" he said; \"lam proud"], [272, "264 THE DIE IS CAST. to say I have the right to relieve you of all responsibility on that score.\" \"I was going to say,\" continued Summerly, \"that as a friend of her father's, if I saw her making a mis take, and blindly spoiling her life, I think I ought to warn her.\" Laurencs Vanlyn threw his cigar out of the window. \"What do you mean ?\" he asked. \" I mean to speak plainly to you, and as a friend,\" returned Summerly. \" You will do me a favour if you will take it as it is meant. There are some ugly stories going about. People say you are in pecuniary difficulties, that you gamble and in various other ways get through more money than you ought. They are good enough to add that you are marrying Miss Ban nerleigh to set your affairs straight. I think it only fair to give you an opportunity of contradicting such reports.\" Laurence Vanlyn rose, and paced the room ex citedly. \" What a villanous shame it is to tell such lies !\" he cried ; \"lies, too, that it is almost impossible to contradict, because they have a faint vestige of truth in them. As to my gambling, for instance : I have played cards for money \u2014 so have you, I suppose, so has nearly every other man in society \u2014 but I have never played high. I may have staked a franc or two at Monte Carlo, for the sake of something to do. I do not deny that I had several pairs of gloves on the Derby. There is a vagueness about the various other charges"], [273, "TnE DIE IS CAST. 265 which defies contradiction. My conscience does not help me to guess at their nature. As to marrying Enid for her money, the thing is too absurd on the face of it. You know (no one better) how I first became acquainted with her. Neither you nor her father accused me of mercenary motives then, and I see no additional reason why they should be imputed to me now. Poor child ! it is not a very flattering compliment to her. She is attractive enough to satisfy most people, without anything else.\" \" There is one way you can give the world the lie as far as that is concerned,\" said Summerly quickly : \" settle the whole of her money on her.\" Vanlyn turned a shade paler. \" And tell it at the same time that she has married a man she cannot trust, and that her money is more precious than herself? You seem to forget if these reports of my extravagance have gone abroad, such a course would be simply confirming them.\" \"Better that reflection than the other,\" said Sum merly. \" If you really care for Miss Bannerleigh as she deserves to be cared for \u2014 \" Vanlyn threw himself into a chair, and covered his face with his hands. \"I do care for her,\" he said, in a low voice. \"I love her with all my heart and soul ; enough even to bear this for her sake, if she wishes it. She must decide.\" \" She will look at it from your point of view, no doubt,\" said Summerly rather bitterly."], [274, "266 THE DIE IS CAST. \"Summerly,\" cried Laurence Vanlyn, \"there is one thing which distresses me not a little in the matter : it is that you could believe such things of me. Have I ever given you cause to look upon me as anything but a gentleman and a man of honour ?\" \"No,\" returned his companion reluctantly. \" And yet you believe a lot of gossiping lies against me !\" \"I never said I believed them,\" said Summerly; \" but I thought it fair to give you an opportunity of proving them false.\" \" I am quite willing to do so.\" \" When do you think of being married ?\" \"As soon as possible,\" he returned eagerly; \"as soon as Enid is willing. There is nothing to wait for.\" \" Then you will have an excellent opportunity of discussing the subject of settlements with her to morrow.\" \u00bbj \" I should like to do so in your presence,\" said Vanlyn. \" After all that has been said against me, I want you to see everything is quite fair and straight. I will put the whole thing before her, and she shall decide. Can I say more than that ?\" Summerly was compelled to admit that he could not; and yet, after Vanlyn had gone, a vague feeling of distrust and uneasiness still filled his mind. He could not get rid of the idea that there was something wrong."], [275, "CHAPTER XXXIV. ONE STEP MORE. With the morrow came Laurence Vanlyn, looking his handsomest and best. Summerly and Enid were in the library when he arrived. Summerly had made the excuse of asking her to correct some MS. for him, that the three might meet without any apparent arrangement. He did not even tell Enid that he ex pected her lover. For the present he considered it due to Laurence Vanlyn to leave the matter entirely in his hands ; and, after all, the fact remained that no one had any real right to influence or prejudice Enid but the man she was going to marry. She looked up as the door opened, and a little joy ful cry broke from her lips. \" 0 Laurie,\" she said, \"how good of you to come so early !\" \"Particularly self-sacrificing, was not it ?\" he said lightly ; and then he shook hands with Summerly, and there was a look of gratitude in his eyes as he did so. \" When I tell you what I have come about, perhaps you will not think me so deserving of praise. I have come to worry you with business.\" \"Business !\" said Enid; \" I am deplorably ignor ant upon the subject.\" \" I had serious thoughts of bringing a lawyer under my arm.\" \"I am glad you did not,\" she said; \"I should"], [276, "268 ONE STEP MORE. have felt as if my last hour had come, and he was here to make my will.\" \" Then you would have to consider to whom you would leave your money.\" \" That would not take long,\" she returned. \" I should leave it all to you.\" \"If you knew what a fiend of wickedness I am supposed to be, you would cut me off without a shil ling.\" Something in his eyes startled her a little ; he was looking anxious in spite of his light words. \" Laurie,\" she said seriously, \" what is this busi ness you have come about ? anything unpleasant?\" \" No, dear,\" he said, with the old look in his eyes, \" nothing that need trouble you. The truth is, Mr. Summerly tells me some absurd gossip has got about that I am an extravagant fellow, and likely to play ducks and drakes with your money, and good ness knows what. Of course he cannot discover who invented the story or repeated it, but such things having been said, we \u2014 Mr. Summerly and I \u2014 think you ought to be told about it ; and, to make you quite safe from my future recklessness, it will be best to have all your money absolutely settled on yourself, so that I cannot touch a farthing. I don't want you to con sider me for one moment, dear. If I know in my heart that my wife trusts me, I can bear the degrada tion of other people saying she does not.\" The colour came and went in a crimson tide across her face while he was speaking, her eyes flashed, her"], [277, "269 ONE STEP MORE. hands trembled; she interrupted him before he could say more. \" Laurie,\" she said, \" Laurie, how can you speak to me of such a wretched grovelling thing ! What do you suppose would be the good of the money to me if it were not yours also ? I should hate the very name of it ! I feel ashamed that such a suggestion should have been made to me !\" \"Don't be angry with me, Enid,\" he said; \"I knew you would not like it, but I had no alternative but to mention the subject to you. Mr. Summerly will do me the justice to say so too.\" \" He had no alternative,\" said Summerly. \" Con sidering what people are saying, I think it would be better that something, at least \u2014 \" \" If people are anxious to discuss our private affairs,\" cried Enid, interrupting him, \" tell them where I can trust myself I can trust my money, and that I have the conceit to value the first more highly than the last. If they want to know anything else they had better come to me.\" \" They very likely will,\" said Laurence Vanlyn ; \" they may even try to prejudice you against me.\" \" ' Never yet was noble man but made ignoble talk; he makes no friend who never made a foe,' \" she quoted; and then, looking at him, a smile stole over her face, and the anger died out of her eyes. \" Let me forget it,\" she said. \" I was in a terrible passion a minute ago ; I have not been so angry for years ; it takes it out of me, and makes me tired. Let"], [278, "270 ONE STEP MORE. us go for a ride in the Row, and promise that this subject shall never be mentioned between us again.\" He took her hand, and drew her towards him. \"My darling,\" he said, \"I cannot tell you how deeply your faith in me has sunk into my heart. I will devote my life to being worthy of the trust you have imposed in me.\" Summerly knew then that the die was irrevocably cast \u2014 as irrevocably as if already the priest's voice had pronounced them man and wife. Laurence Vanlyn would, for a variety of obvious reasons, beg for a speedy marriage, and Enid was in no mood to refuse his request. When they had gone he still sat there thinking ; he had done his best, and he could do no more. He thought of the smile which came into her face when she looked at Laurence Vanlyn, and of the little quo tation which came so readily to her lips : it struck him that the speech of poor heart-broken Elaine as little applied to Laurence Vanlyn as it did to Sir Launcelot of the Lake himself. Then his thoughts travelled back to that last night he saw her at Tudor House, when she looked so per fectly happy before she had known an hour's sorrow. He saw again the fluttering white dress and the bunch of scarlet poppies ; he seemed to hear her merry laugh ; and the recollection of its very brightness made him inexpressibly sad. He saw Max in the afternoon, and told him what had happened. It was a sort of relief to talk to him about it."], [279, "ONE STEP MORE. 271 \"Vanlyn put the thing very cleverly,\" he said. \" I could not find fault with him, although I could see quite plainly all the time that he meant to have his own way. I daresay things will turn out better than we expect. Vanlyn is too popular not to have some enemies ; the chances are against his being as black as he is painted.\" \" I think Enid is right,\" said Max loyally. \" From our point of view, it would have been wiser to keep her money herself, but from hers it would have been an insult to Vanlyn and a reflection on his honour. As long as I am alive she will have no cause to regret her decision.\" \"You have been very generous to her,\" said Sum merly. \" I wish with all my heart it had been you instead of Vanlyn.\" Max laughed harshly and bitterly. \" That was not possible,\" he said. \" She could never really care for a fellow like me ; women don't, as a rule.\" As Summerly had surmised, the wedding was fixed to take place in a month, after which Mr. and Mrs. Vanlyn would take their departure for Scotland, a plea sant change after the heat and fatigue of a London season. Laurence Vanlyn was in excellent spirits. The descendants of Judah worried him no longer; they were quite content to wait. He obtained the loan of five hundred pounds at the reasonable rate of twenty five per cent. Several gentlemen who were the happy"], [280, "272 ONE STEP MORE. possessors of sundry pieces of paper adorned with his signature contemplated them and him with satisfaction and renewed hope. Enid was surrounded by dressmakers and mil liners, and so the time passed very quickly to all but Max. He felt much like a condemned criminal, in whom the hope of reprieve had turned into the certainty of despair. He would have given anything if he could have found courage to leave London, and never see Enid again ; but it was not possible. He told himself that she might want him, and she had begged so bard that he would not shun her or make any difference in his manner or thoughts. Sometimes she would ask him to execute trifling commissions for her; some times to come in for a quiet chat, and talk the whole time of the merits and attractions of Laurence Vanlyn. Max knew he must live through it and bear it, smiling as he did so. Probably after she was married he would be constantly invited to her house. He must meet her in society, all because, if the need ever came, he must be there to help her. It was the part he had selected to play in life's drama. \" Max,\" she said to him one afternoon, when he bad dropped in to tea, \" I am going to ask a great favour of you ; you have always been so kind to me, I think you will grant it.\" \" Of course I will grant it. She hesitated, and played nervously with the lace on her dress."], [281, "273 ONE STEP MORE. \" It has something to do with my wedding. I want you to give me away.\" \"Enid!\" he exclaimed, and turned away that she might not see his face. \"Laurence would like it so much, and so should I,\" she said, in a low voice. \" Now papa is dead, there is no one I should wish to take his place as much as you.\" \" I am afraid I shall not be in town,\" replied Max. \" Of course I appreciate the compliment you and Vanlyii have paid me, but no doubt Mr. Summerly \u2014 \" \" Max,\" she said, \"you have not forgiven me yet. Well, I do not deserve it. They say there is no perfect happiness in this world. I thought I should be able to prove the falseness of the assertion on my wedding day ; but, after all, there will be one crumpled rose-leaf if y*ou are not there.\" \" There is no question of forgiveness between us,\" he said. \" I voluntarily gave you back your liberty. If we are to be friends in the future, we must forget the past.\" \" I often think when I hear you laughing that you have forgotten it,\" she said eagerly, almost pleadingly. \" I like to think so, Max.\" \" Do you ?\" he returned. \"I will try and laugh very often if it gives you pleasure.

Of one fact I feel tolerably certain, and that is that I shall live to be a hundred \u2014 people in my circumstances always do ; it proves the perversity of human nature.\" \" Don't get reckless,\" she said, looking at him with a troubled anxious expression. \" I don't like to hear you talk as if life had to be got through.\" \" That is just it,\" he said ; \" it has to be got through.\" \"I remember one day,\" she said, \" in the harvest time, long ago, you rode home to fetch me away from my work. We went to the cornfields, and you gathered me a bunch of poppies. Last night I was dreaming of it, and you were looking at me with the old happy light in your eyes. You were never reckless in those days, Max ; only very gentle and sometimes a little distant to me.\" \" I want to be gentle to you now and always,\" he returned, in a low voice. \" I should like you to regard me as your friend. I shall always be at hand if I am wanted.\" She gave a little sigh. \"Yes,\" she said, \"I often think of that, and the thought rests me. You are so big and strong and \u2014 kind.\" Miss Summerly joined them, and after tea Max took his departure. He walked about till quite late at night, walked he scarcely knew where ; but he felt very tired when he returned to his hotel. He sat down almost mechani-"], [283, "A FATAL SECRET. 275 cally at the writing-table, and his hand shook a little as he took up the pen. \" The thought of my nearness rests her,\" he thought. \" I am big and strong and \u2014 \" he did not finish the sentence as she had finished it. He began to write : \"Dear Enid,\u2014 I am afraid I was remiss enough to leave you to-day without giving a decided answer to your kind and flattering invitation. Upon second thoughts, which are proverbially the best, I shall be delighted to postpone my previous engagement, and fill the capacity of parent on the auspicious occasion of your marriage. \u2014 With kindest regards, yours very sin cerely, Maxwell Lyndern.\" He read the letter over when he had finished it. \" Ninety-nine fellows out of a hundred in my place would go to the devil,\" he said musingly. \" I hope I shall not ; it is a cowardly weak thing to do, and yet I sometimes feel as if I were not quite so strong as she fancies. I get so terribly tired of fighting and living on with the pain at my heart, and laughing ! 0 my God, what a mockery it all is !\" CHAPTEtt XXXV. A FATAL SECRET. The wedding was to be a very quiet one. It was the wish of both bride and bridegroom that it should"], [284, "276 A FATAL SECRET. be so. Enid had very few friends but the Summerlys, and they and Max were to be the only guests. Max declined Summerly's invitation to stay the night at Empress Gate. \" Do not fear my being late,\" he had answered, with a smile ; \" you will see me arrive in a hansom in excel lent time to fulfil my duties.\" He kept his word. Punctually at half-past ten he came. Mr. Summerly was alone, awaiting him in the drawing-room. \"You are punctuality itself,\" he said, shaking bands ; and then he stopped, the smile died on his lips, and he looked steadily at Max. If heiiad not suspected the miserable truth all along, there could be no doubt about it now. \" Lyndern,\" he said kindly, \" you are not up to the mark. You must let me make your excuses to Miss Bamierleigh, aud take your place.\" Max laughed. 0, such a terrible mockery of mirth it sounded ! \"I am all right,\" he said, in a hollow voice. \"I have had neuralgia all night ; that is what makes me look seedy. Do I strike you as presenting a sufficiently patriarchal appearance to play the part I have under taken '?\" \" You look like a ghost, my dear fellow.\" \"How lively! Something like Alonzo the Brave.

I almost forget the story ; but I believe it was tragic and grotesque \u2014 the two mostly go together.\" He looked at his companion and laughed for the third time. \" Do you think Enid can hear me laughing?\" he asked suddenly. \" She says it makes her happy. I \u2014 I have been practising most of the night ; it makes a pleasant variation to the neuralgia. I am anxious Enid should be quite happy. I hope she can hear me. \"Heaven forbid !\" said Mr. Summerly gravely, and laying his hand kindly on the other's shoulder. \" I would not have her hear you for anything ; it would frighten her. My poor fellow, how could you have tortured yourself like this ?\" \" She wished it,\" he said, with a gasp ; \" that was the reason.\" There was no need for explanation ; these two men had been learning to understand each other during the last weeks. \"Do I look very bad?\" asked Max, putting his hand to his head, and raising the eyes that Enid had once thought full of unconscious pathos, to his com panion's face. \" I thought I should pass all right, and get through it creditably.\" \"You look terribly bad,\" returned Mr. Summerly. \" You are utterly unfit to go through it.\" \"She will not see,\" said Max. \"Laurence Van lyn will be there.\" \" Do not try to laugh, talk very little, and make the most of the neuralgia,\" advised Mr. Summerly. \" If"], [286, "278 A FATAL SECRET. you persist in going on with this, I suppose you must ; but I am afraid you have over-calculated your strength.\" Maxwell Lyndern clenched his hands and walked the length of the room. When he turned round, his face wore a more natural expression, but it was still quite colourless. \"I shall f get through it,\" he said; \"I shall get through it.\" There was the sound of voices outside the door, then some one turned the handle and came in. It was Enid, followed by Miss Summerly. One breathless moment of suspense, and then Max took Enid's hands in his. \" Good-morning,\" he said, in a monotonous tone, just as if he were repeating a lesson. \"The Fates are kind; they have blessed you with a fine day. I am very glad ; it is a good omen.\" \" Thank you,\" she returned, without looking at him, and with a half shy, wholly glad light in her eyes. She was dressed quite simply, and looked much more like going for a stroll in the Park than being married. \" We are not late ?\" she asked, turning to Mr. Summerly. \" I promised Laurence to be in very good time.\" \" No,\" he answered; \" but it is time we started.\" She turned to Max. \"It is kind of you to take papa's place,\" she said rather tremulously. \" Some time I shall be better able to thank you than I am now.\" \"Don't try,\" he said; \"there is no need.\" And"], [287, "279 A FATAL SECRET. then he gave her his arm and they went to the car riage. It had been arranged that they were all to drive to the church together : it was quite near, and it would make less fuss. When the carriage stopped, Max knew that the most awful moment of agony in his life had come ; that all the courage and all the strength he possessed might prove inadequate to the strain. He felt dizzy and bewildered, as in a dream he saw the church, the altar-rails, the clergyman, the few spectators dotted about in the pews on either side of him. He felt deadly cold, and the little gloved hand resting so lightly on his arm seemed like a ton weight. He walked steadily up the aisle beside the girl who was to have been bis wife, and then some one else stepped out of the vestry and took his place. \" Dearly beloved.\" The clergyman's voice sounded to Max like the roar of a mighty ocean ; he wondered the people stood so quietly and did not appear to notice it. Perhaps it was the noise in his own head all the time. It grew louder and louder, till it seemed like a shriek. Then there was a sudden lull ; the roar turned to a murmur without meaning in it. Suddenly a sharp sword seemed thrust into his heart. In one second he was keenly alive to everything around him : he took in at a glance the smallest details, down to the flowers on the altar and the bright colours of the marker in the clergyman's book. It was Enid's voice. Softly and tremulously she spoke the two words, \" I will.\""], [288, "280 A FATAL SECRET. And then came the question, \"Who giveth this woman to be married to this man ?\" He took her hand in his \u2014 the hand upon which he had showered such passionate kisses, the hand that was once his \u2014 and gave it away. He knew that the end had come now ; that ever hereafter he had to look for ward to the hopeless agony of a great despair. The merciful sound of rushing waters that had deafened him before was still now. Clearly and distinctly every word of the service sounded in his ears ; he did not miss one. He wondered how long it had lasted \u2014 it seemed hours. Some one touched him on the shoulder ; he turned with a start ; it was Mr. Summerly. \" It is over,\" be said softly. Max followed him into the vestry. There were the usual congratulations and name signings to be gone through. Max did it all \u2014 he never flinched. With a firm steady hand he wrote his name in the register as a witness of the marriage. He took the hand of the woman from whom he was now irre vocably divided, and wished her long and unalloyed happiness with some one else ; and then he promised often to come to her house when she and her husband returned ; he promised everything she asked him with out the slightest hesitation, and in the same mechani cal sort of way in which he had done all else. Two minutes afterwards he had no idea of a word he had uttered. Laurence Vanlyn was in very good spirits, although"], [289, "A FATAL SECRET. 281 ho announced that he had had to support himself with a bottle of champagne before he felt equal to going through the trying ordeal of being married. He was not looking at his wife when he said it. Max saw she turned away, that he might not see the look of dis appointment that came across her face. She felt angry with herself that this little joke at her expense should make her flinch. Laurie did not mean it, of course. \"How do you think I look this morning?\" con tinued Vanlyn, turning to Mr. Summerly. \"I feel quite proud of my appearance, considering I was up all night with a hottish lot of fellows. They told me it was usual to give your bachelor friends a little enter tainment the night before the sacrifice.\" \" You look very well,\" returned Mr. Summerly shortly. He wondered if Enid had heard that last remark. \" I think it is time we said good-bye,\" said Mrs. Vanlyn rather unsteadily. \"We must not miss our train.\" She turned from the others to Max, and he saw that there were tears iu her eyes. \" Good-bye, Max,\" she said. \" You will be look ing better when we come back, and we shall see you often.\" \"Yes, you will see me often,\" he repeated. The few spectators had left the church, and were grouped round the door and carriage. Among them was a handsome Italian boy. His dress and face made him conspicuous in the crowd. As the bridal party"], [290, "282 A FATAL SECRET. reached the door, the boy pushed his way up to the carriage and stood there. In an instant Laurence Vanlyn had seen him. His face changed to a deadly whiteness ; his eyes seemed unable to leave the fierce face of the Italian. He said, almost roughly, to Enid, \" Get in ;\" but still he was not looking at her. The boy's hand rested on the carriage-door, but he never moved and never spoke. Almost before Mr. Vanlyn was seated, Max closed the door with a bang. \"Drive on !\" he shouted. But the boy was too quick for him. He laughed with hideous, ghastly mirth, and, before Max could stop him, threw a piece of rope he had been holding behind him into the carriage. \"What does it mean, Laurie?\" asked Enid, in a frightened tone. Her husband did not answer ; he was leaning back with his eyes closed. Max turned round, and caught the boy by the arm. \"Come with me,\" he said; \"I want to speak to you.\" They walked quietly away from the church to gether, leaving the small crowd behind. \"Now,\" said Max, stopping, and facing his com panion, \" tell me why you threw that rope at Mr. Vanlyn ?\" The boy looked at him curiously, wonderingly. \" Are you a friend of his ?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" answered Max."], [291, "A FATAL SECRET. 283 \"' Then ask him how he likes carrying about a fatal secret which he knows may at any time be re vealed ; living over a mine which in a second may be sprung ? Ask him if he thinks he would still rather die than endure such a life ? Tell him Flippo wants to know.\" \" What can you know of his secrets ?\" said Max, with parched, dry lips. \" Give him the message, and see.' \" You must tell me what you know of Mr. Vanlyn,\" said Max, \" for \u2014 for his wife's sake.\" \" His wife !\" with a contemptuous mocking laugh ; \" his dead wife or his living one ? I will tell you this : Hatred never dies ; Revenge waits ; Retribu tion creeps on : so says the music of the old violin across the waters ; so says the music of the old violin night after night to that man. It has followed him \u2014 it has haunted him, sleeping and waking ; and it will follow and haunt him still.\" \"No,\" cried Max; \"whatever he has done, have mercy on him. Is there nothing which will induce you to give up this persecution ?\" The Italian raised his flashing eyes, with a fierce undying hatred in them, and answered, \" Nothing.\" Max made a last effort to discover the secret. \" Of what crime do you accuse Mr. Vanlyn ?\" The Italian leaned forward, and whispered one word in his ear. Max staggered back like a man who has been shot. \" It is not true,\" he gasped ; \" it cannot be true !\""], [292, "CHAPTER XXXVI. LAURENCE VANLYN's WIFE In the middle of September Mr. and Mrs. Vanlyn returned to town. It was not a fashionable time to be there ; people had betaken themselves into the country for shooting, or to the seaside for yachting ; but the Vanlyns had two or three reasons for wishing to return to town, for a time at least. They took a furnished house in Belgravia, and invited Max and the Summerlys to dinner on the second evening after their return. Enid was alone when the Summerlys arrived. Her greeting was very warm, and struck them both rather forcibly. \" I have been longing to see you again ; there is a dreariness about being away from everyone,\" she said. \" We have missed you a good deal, and \u2014 Max, how is Max, Mr. Summerly?\" \"Better,\" he answered; \"but he does not look very well even now.\" She was playing with the bracelet on her arm in an absent sort of way. \" Better !\" she said, raising her head. \" Has he been ill ?\" \" He was taken ill the day you went away,\" he answered; \"we thought he would be better nursed and looked after with us, so we made him stay at Empress Gate.\""], [293, "LAURENCE VANLYN's WIFE. 285 \" 0, poor Max,\" she said a little unsteadily. \" It was very kind of you. He seems terribly alone. Was \u2014 was he very ill ?\" \" He had a sharp attack of brain fever ; it left him very weak.\" \"Why was I not told ?\" \" He particularly wished you not to be,\" said Miss Summerly. \" It might have been a crumpled rose-leaf, he said ; and we quite agreed with him it would have done no good, and only damped your pleasure.\" \" My pleasure !\" she repeated bitterly. \" Ah, yes, it was generous of Max to give me credit for even so much consideration as that.\" \"He likes to be generous,\" said Summerly. Enid turned away, and moved a book lying on the table. She was smiling when she looked back at them. \"I am sorry Laurence is late,\" she said; \"he was detained at his club, and only came in ten minutes ago. Club friends have a way of making him late. We met a few of them in Scotland. I think their society was quite a boon to Laurence. He pre fers cards and billiards to ruralising, and I think he is quite right. He very soon brought me round to his way of thinking.\" \"It is a relief to rest sometimes,\" said Mr. Sum merly. \"Is it?\" she answered. \"I don't think I need relief of that sort ; I would rather keep going from morning till night. Laurence says a quiet life would drive him mad. Ah, here is Max.\""], [294, "286 LAURENCE VANLYN's WIFE. She went a step or two to meet him, holding out her hand. He thought she looked very beautiful in her white dress. It was very elaborate and grand \u2014 just the sort of dress one would imagine Laurence Vanlyn's wife would wear. \"How do you do?\" he said. \"It is nice to see you in town again.\" \" Thank you,\" she answered. \" Mr. Summerly has been telling me of your illness, Max. You pro mised when we said good-bye that you would be look ing better when we next met.\" \" Did I ?\" he said, smiling. \"I will try not to make such rash promises in the future. How is Vanlyn ?\" \" Quite well, thank you,\" answered Laurence, coming in in time to answer for himself. He seemed to have lost a little of his languor and to be more excitable. Once or twice during dinner he spoke irritably to the servants and his wife ; he talked a great deal, and ate very little. He was anxious to hear the latest intelligence, and appeared quite annoyed that one or two social events had taken place during his absence. \" Just my luck,\" he said, with reference to them ; \"things never go right for me: I think I am the most unlucky fellow living.\" Mr. Summerly hastened to change the subject. \" How did you like Scotland ?\" he said. Laurence Vanlyn shrugged his shoulders. \" We were bored to death the first part of the time we were there, were we not, Enid?\" he returned,"], [295, "LAURENCE VANLYN's WIFE. 287 appealing to his wife ; \" it was quite a relief to us both when some fellows I knew turned up.\" The smile never left her face ; she answered with a light laugh, \" I think it was ; the theoretical bliss of a honey moon generally ends in yawns ; we felt a little like Edwin and Angelina in Punch, when they longed for a friend to turn up, or even an enemy.\" \" Take my advice, Lyndern,\" said Laurence Vanlyn ; \" when you get married, go to Paris or Rome.\" \" Thank you,\" returned Max. Nothing would have given him greater delight at that moment than to have knocked his host's head against the wall ; he knew quite well that, under the smile Enid was learning so well to wear, her heart was aching miser ably. He knew that the husband, who made no secret of how little he cared for her, would not spare' her, or make life more bearable as it went on. Enid had once said it was so much easier to be artificial than real. How terribly artificial she would become in this new life she had chosen for herself! During the evening she played and sang, and talked gaily and pleasantly ; once, when Max was stand ing alone by the window, she came up to him. \" The room is very hot,\" she said ; \" could we not open the window ?\" He drew aside the curtain. \" I think I can reach it,\" he said, smiling. \" You used to say I was big and strong.\" \" 0 yes,\" she said. \"I begin to think now it was"], [296, "288 LAURENCE VANLYN's WIFE. another of the theories which break down when put into practice ; you are not so strong as you were.\" \" I am getting along all right. How is your head- ache ?\" \" How did you know I had one ?\" she asked suddenly, looking at him. \" You have had abad headache all the evening,\" he returned; \" and you have been laughing and talking more than usual in consequence ; you will soon wear yourself out if you try to do that.\" \"People in society have no time to feel ill,\" she said. \" I believe we are aspiring to be in society.\" \" Vanlyn would not like you to do more than you are able,\" said Max. \" 0 no,\" she returned, with a light laugh ; \" Lau rence is very considerate ; but he has a rooted aversion to people with headaches, so I never confide in him.\" \" I do not think it is difficult to find out without being confided in,\" said Max. \" You always had an uncanny way of finding me out and spoiling me,\" she said rather unsteadily; \"you must give it up, and let me be deceitful in my own way.' He did not answer. After a minute she spoke again. \" We are quite full of engagements already,\" she said. \" There seem to be plenty of people left in London even now.\" \" Don't try and entertain me,\" he said, suddenly, looking down at her. \"I want to see you rest for five minutes.\""], [297, "LAURENCE VANLYN's WIFE. 289 \" I have given up resting,\" she returned, laughing ; \"it does not answer.\" Soon the evening came to an end, and Max left with the Summerlys. \" Come in and have a cigar,\" said Summerly ; \" I want to talk to you.\" Max followed him into the smoking-room. \" Well,\" he said, after a good long silence, and looking at his companion, \" what do you want to tell me?\" \" Something I heard to-day about Vanlyn. He is going the pace with a vengeance.\" Max made no comment. \" Have you heard anything of the kind ? \"Yes,\" he answered shortly. \" To begin with, the house he has taken is absurdly beyond his means ; then this gambling mania seems to have taken a fearful hold upon him ; he is excitable and restless, and unlike himself. Where is it going to end?\" \" I don't know,\" said Max, with a shudder. \" We shall know very soon,\" returned Summerly. \" It seems preposterous that Enid should have to work her brain to get them bread-and-cheese ; Vanlyn will never do anything but spend money ; I expect he will fall back upon her.\" \" She cannot write in her present state of mind,\" said Max; \"it is not possible. She is over-exerting herself now ; her own story is the only one she will be occupied with at present.\" v"], [298, "290 I DARE NOT FORGET. \" Then what are they to do?\" \" Enid will not take any harm as long as I have anything left,\" he said. \" You see,\" with a pathetic smile, \" I have no one to leave my money to, so I shall be glad if it can be of use to her.\" \" Maxwell Lyndern,\" said Summerly, \"if there is another man in England as generous as you, I should like to meet him.\" CHAPTER XXXVII. \"I DARE NOT FORGET.' During the four months that followed, Max saw very little of Enid except in society, and then she was generally surrounded by literary and artistic people, often by friends of her husband, and he had no oppor tunity of talking to her. Sometimes she drove into the Park, and often went to the theatre or opera ; she seemed perpetually in a whirl of gaiety, and always looked happy, with that pleasant animated smile on her face that so successfully deceived every one but Max. One evening be had promised to dine with them, and go to the theatre. \" Come early,\" Enid had said ; \" I want to have a long talk with you.\" Now, as always, he obeyed her smallest wish. It was barely half-past five when he appeared. She was dressed and waiting to receive him, sitting in the fire-"], [299, "291 I DARE NOT FORGET. light. Vases of delicate hothouse flowers were about the room, everything artistic and beautiful seemed around her, and yet a sense of desolation about Enid herself struck him painfully. He went up to her and held out his hand. \" I have kept my promise and come early,\" he said. \"I knew you would,\" she answered; \"you never disappoint me.\" \"Enid !\" he cried, \"you are ill, you look horribly pale, and \u2014 you have been \u2014 \" \" Don't !\" she said ; \" for pity's sake, don't be kind to me or sorry for me. I think I have succeeded in making myself tired, and the result is not becoming. My maid told me I ought not to wear black to-night, but I had a fancy for trying to look like the old Enid that you used to know once, long ago. I thought we could talk better if we could forget the years (or can it be only months?) that have passed since then.\" He rested his elbow on the chimney-piece, and looked into the fire. \" I am afraid the experiment has not been a success,\" she said, trying to speak lightly, after a pause. \" You cannot forget them.\" Slowly he raised his eyes to hers. \" I dare not forget them,\" he returned, in a low voice. \" Max,\" she said suddenly, \" if it were not for you, I sometimes think I should break down altogether ; and then I fall to wondering why it is that you are so intensely good and gentle to me. You know directly"], [300, "292 I DARE NOT FORGET. if I am tired or unhappy, and your presence always rests me. Then, too, if I know Laurence is with you, it is an intense relief; be has become so unnerved and worried of late, and I find it difficult to please him.\" After a pause : \" I want to ask you something, and I know you will tell me the truth. Do you think there is some special thing troubling him?\" \" What put such an idea in your head ?\" returned Max, moving away, and looking with great interest at the flowers on the table. \" I will tell you. Constantly he wakes up in the night, and seems afraid of hearing something ; indeed, he often asks me if I cannot hear music, and will scarcely believe I am speaking the truth when I say no.\" \" It is probably all fancy,\" returned Max ; \"a case of unstrung nerves. It would do you both good to get away.\" Enid shook her head thoughtfully. \"It is not always fancy,\" she said; \"because sometimes I hear it, too. It is always the same tune, ' Ah, che la morte,' and it is played on a violin.\" \" People who worry one with street-concerts ought to be annihilated,\" returned Max, still intent on the flowers. \"I have begged Laurence to speak of the annoy ance to the police, or at least remonstrate with the boy himself ; but he will do neither, and forbade me to do so, too.\" Suddenly she went up to him, and laid her hand on his arm."], [301, "293 I DARE NOT FORGET. \" Promise you will never breathe to any living soul what I am goiug to ask you,\" she said, regarding him with pleading frightened eyes. \" I promise.\" \" Do you think it possible that Laurence is afraid to send the boy away ? The idea haunts me day and night, and I cannot get rid of it.\" \"Of course not,\" said Max. \"If you get such absurd fancies into your head, I shall have to be quite angry with you.\" \" They are not absurd',\" she said. \" The boy who plays on the violin is the same person who threw the piece of rope into the carriage the day we were married. / have seen him.\" \" So have I,\" said Max; \" and I can easily explain the whole thing : the boy is mad. Now dismiss it entirely from your mind, and let us talk of something else. Are you writing now ?\" She walked wearily back to her chair. \" No,\" she returned ; \" I think I have done writing for the rest of my life. We have too much glitter and tinsel around us for work. And then I laugh most of the day, and that takes up time. One cannot live two lives at once.\" \"If I can persuade Vanlyn to take you away for a time, you will have a rest, and begin again quite bril liantly.\" \"If he goes, it will be to Monte Carlo,\" she said. \" He often talks of it. I have a horror of going there It seems like desperation.\""], [302, "294 AN INVITATION FROM A FRIEND. \" We might arrange to get up a party \u2014 the Sum merlys, for instance \u2014 and all go to some pleasant place together.\" \" What !\" she cried, \" you would go to? 0, you are very7 good to us.\" She buried her face in her bands, and remained quite still for a few minutes. When the blaze leapt up he could see the tears glistening on her fingers. He sprang up, and paced the room with hasty strides. Suddenly he stopped before her. \" Enid,\" he said, \" if you do that, you will drive me mad.\" The sound of his voice frightened her. \"I will go to the library, and see if your husband is there,\" he continued after a pause; \" I want to speak to him.\" CHAPTER XXXVIII. AN INVITATION FROM A FRIEND. At six o'clock Laurence Vanlyn came into the drawing-room. He seemed in one of his worst humours, and spoke roughly to his wife. \"Where is Lyndern ?\" he asked. \"I thought he was to come early. People are always disappointing and annoying me.\" \" He did come early,\" said Enid gently. \" I thought"], [303, "295 AN INVITATION FROM A FRIEND. you would have found him in the library ; he wanted to see you, he said.\" Her husband left the room without replying. \"Ah, Lyndern,\" he said, going into the library, \" you are the very fellow I want to see. By the bye, have you and Mrs. Vanlyn quarrelled ? She does not seem in the sweetest temper to-day. I don't wonder at fellows shying matrimony.\" \" We are excellent friends,\" returned Max, clench ing his hands behind him. \" You said you wanted to see me.\" \" Yes, I do. The fact is, I am in a devil of a mess. I don't mind telling you, because you are a good fellow. I am very much pressed for a hundred pounds, a debt of honour, you know ; and it will go confoundedly rough with me if I can't pay. If you would let me have it for a few days, I should be infinitely obliged to you : of course, as I say, it is only a matter of a few days.\" He pushed his white jewelled fingers through his hair and looked at his companion. \" You want a cheque for WOL,\" said Max coolly. It was not the first time he had obliged Mr. Vanlyn with a similar loan. \"If I make it 150L, should you feel disposed to bring your wife and join the Summerlys and me in some quiet place for a month's rest ? Enid is not looking well ; I think the change would do her good.\" \" The fact is, I had half arranged to go out for a little trip myself,\" returned Vanlyn. \"Enid seems to"], [304, "296 AN INVITATION FROM A FRIEND. object to the idea of Monte Carlo, and I like it ; I have no doubt she will be delighted to join you and the Summerlys.\" \" That would not quite do,\" said Max ; \" Enid would not be happy away from you.\" \" What bosh ! Why is Enid always to be con sidered before me ?\" cried Vanlyn irritably; \"let her go her own way and me mine ; that is by far the most sensible arrangement.\" \" If you don't pay this debt of honour, what will be the consequence ?\" asked Max, laying down the pen and looking at his companion. \" It must be paid,\" said Vanlyn excitedly ; \" I dare not think of the consequences.\" \"If I pay it, do you still propose going to Monte Carlo without your wife ?\" \" Look here, Lyndern, what are you driving at ? You may as well speak plainly. Are you going to make the loan conditional ?\" \" I will speak plainly. I do not see the use of helping you out of one difficulty that you may get into another. I know that you have come to the end of your wife's money, or nearly so ; if you stay in London, Heaven only knows how it will end. Your one chance of getting straight is to cut the whole concern and start afresh. If you will do that, you may be quite sure I shall remain your friend.\" \" I care very little what becomes of me,\" said Vanlyn doggedly. \" I. often think I shall blow my brains out and end it '"], [305, "297 AN INVITATION FROM A FRIEND. Max looked deliberately and contemptuously at him* \" Really !\" he said ; \" is that the particular form of despatch which presents itself most favourably to your mind ? Don't you think three months at Mentone would, on the whole, be preferable?\"' \" If I go there, you will sign the cheque ? \" Yes.\" \" Sign it, please.\" Max laid down the pen once more. \" When shall we start?\" he said. \" Next week, if you like.'' \"Very well, that is settled.\" He signed the cheque for 150/., and handed it to Vanlyn. \" Mrs. Vanlyn is waiting dinner,\" said Laurence, putting it in his pocket-book. They went into the drawing-room together. The possession of the cheque seemed to improve considerably the state of Mr. Vanlyn's temper. Enid talked very little during dinner. She reminded Max painfully of the time when he first saw her sitting in the dreary garret alone and broken-hearted ; she seemed just as weak now, and as much in need of some one to take care of her. They were still at dessert when the carriage was announced. \" I don't feel up to going through a theatre to night,\" said Laurence. \" You will take Mrs. Vanlyn.\" Enid rose and went to her husband, laying her hand on the back of his chair."], [306, "298 AN INVITATION FROM A FRIEND. \" I should be so glad to stay at home, too,\" she said very gently. \" Laurie, let us give up going out for to-night, and have a quiet evening at home.\" He turned sharply round. \" That is a new game,\" he said ; \"you are gener ally ready enough for gaiety.\" \" I think I am tired of it,\" she returned wearily; \" I would so much rather stay at home with you.\" \" What bosh ! Surely Lyndern can take you to the theatre ?\" She made one last piteous little struggle to win back the love and tenderness for which her heart was aching. \" I have often gone out to please you, dear,\" she said, resting her fingers lovingly on his hair ; \" do let us have one of the old pleasant evenings like those we used to have before we were married.\" He pushed her hand roughly away. \"Good Lord, Enid!\" he cried, \"how you worry and bother ! You know I hate those confoundedly slow evenings, and as to being tied for ever to your apron strings, I neither can nor will put up with it ; go or stay at home, it does not matter to me which you do, but for Heaven's sake leave me alone !\" She looked at him for a second, and then she laughed and moved away. \" I think after all you are right,\" she said ; \" quiet evenings would be rather slow. If Max does not mind the trouble of escorting me, we will go to the theatre.\" \" I shall be delighted,\" said Max, with white stern lips."], [307, "299 AN INVITATION FROM A FRIEND. Something in his voice made Enid look at him, and then she knew that he and her husband would remain better friends if they were not left alone to gether just now. \"Come,\" she said, with a smile, \"we shall be late.\" He fastened her shawl round her, and helped her into the carriage. They were both silent until the light of a gas-lamp flashed into their faces, then Enid spoke. \" Do you know, you quite frighten me when you look like that!\" she said. \" Do I ?\" rousing himself. \" I will try and culti vate a more cheerful expression.\" \" You must not fancy Laurence is really cross with me,\" she said, with the old society manner and smile. \" The truth is, he knows exactly what is best for me. In this case, for instance, if he had given in to my whim of staying at home, I should have continued in the morbid, low-spirited way in which you found me this afternoon. Quiet is not good for me ; I am essen tially a butterfly. Now, Laurence cannot really stand the heat of a theatre ; it quite knocks him up. I hope it is not a bore to you to come. I have a great desire to see the piece, or I would not have victimised you.\" He could not see her face \u2014 she took care of that \u2014 - and her voice, from long practice, was under tolerable control ; to-night it was more difficult to manage than usual."], [308, "300 AN INVITATION FROM A FRIEND. \"I am as anxious to see the piece as you are,\" he returned. \" Max,\" she said, suddenly stretching out her hand to him with a little appealing gesture, \"do not be angry with Laurie !\" He did not answer, but took her hand in his \u2014 the hand that her husband had pushed so roughly away \u2014 and held it very tightly. \" I want you to stand by him,\" she said ; \" I think he needs your friendship.\" \" And you ?\" he said. \"People don't trouble them selves about what you need.\" The clasp of his fingers made her feel stronger \" I need your friendship too,\" she said, in a low voice, \" and \u2014 courage.\" \" Vanlyn has promised to bring you to Men tone next week,\" he said. \" I am thinking of taking a house there for three months, and we may be able to persuade the Summerlys to join us. I think the rest will do you good.\" \"Will Laurence go?\" she asked, almost breath lessly. \" Yes, he has promised to do so.\" \" 0, how very kind of him !\" she cried. \" You do not know what a sacrifice it is to him to give up Monte Carlo; he is very unselfish and good to me.\" \" It will be better for him than Monte Carlo,\" said Max dryly. \"Here we are, at the theatre.\" He caw, with a sense of relief, that the idea of leav ing London had made Enid brighter ; she talked with"], [309, "AN INVITATION FROM A FRIEND. 301 less effort, and once or twice, when things struck her as amusing, she laughed. Before the play was over, however, she turned to Max. \"If you do not mind, I should like to go home,\" she said wearily. \" We can have a cab, and need not wait for the carriage.\" \" I am quite ready,\" he said. All the way home she was very silent. When they were standing in the hall she turned to Max. \" You will have a pipe with Laurence before you go,\" she said; \"probably we shall find him in the library.\" He followed her down the passage ; at the door she stopped. \" I don't know what can have made me such a coward to-night,\" she said, \" but I \u2014 I am afraid to go in.\" He looked down at her with a reassuring smile. \"You are overdone; there is nothing to be afraid of.\" With a firm hand he opened the door. \" There is no one here,\" he said. \" Perhaps Van lyn has gone to bed.\" \"No,\" she returned, shivering, \"I don't think so. Max, will you ring the bell ?\" She sat by the fire in silence till the servant came, and when she spoke the fear in her heart came out in her voice. \" Whereris Mr. Vanlyn ?\""], [310, "302 AN INVITATION FROM A FRIEND. \" He went out soon after you left, madam,\" re turned the servant. \" Did he leave any message for me ?\" she asked. \"No; no message.\" \"That will do.\" The servant withdrew. \" Perhaps he left a note ?\" she said, turning to Max. The writing-table was strewn with papers ; one of Vanlyn's coats lay over the back of a chair ; there were some pipes lying on the chimney-piece ; the whole room looked comfortless and untidy. She moved about restlessly, touching first one thing and then another. \" I sometimes think it my fault that poor Laurie is not happier,\" she said, pausing. \"I don't think I was quite the kind of woman to please him. I \u2014 have tried.\" \" If you will take my advice,\" said Max abruptly, \" you will not sit up for him. It would do you good to get a night's rest ;\" and he held out his hand in farewell. \" Say good-bye to Vanlyn for me,\" he said, \" and tell him I shall run across to France to-morrow, and I hope to write to him in three or four days, and tell him my arrangements are completed. From what Summerly said the other day, I have no doubt he and his sister will join us.\" \" Yes,\" she answered absently. \" Max, do you think Laurence intended to go out when we went ?\" \" I don't know,\" he answered. \"Why should you"], [311, "303 AN INVITATION FROM A FRIEND. worry more about him to-night than usual ? Laurence is often out, is not he ?\" \" Yes, often,\" she returned. \" No doubt he went away in a hurry, or he would have left me a message or note. Look ! what is that crumpled piece of paper lying on the hearth ? He may have begun to write to me, and altered his mind.\" She picked it up eagerly and read it, read every word ; and then she caught hold of the back of a chair to support herself. \"It was not meant for me,\" she said; \"I had no right to read it.\" Max could not see her face, it was turned away ; but her voice frightened him. She still held the paper in her hand. Then she laughed. \" It is of no consequence,\" she said ; \" only an invi tation from a friend to spend the evening. Laurence may be late ; I will take your advice, and not sit up for him.\" \"You are very wise,\" he returned. \" Good-night,\" she said, and then she turned her face towards him ; it was all gray and drawn, and her eyes looked intensely pathetic. \" Can I find Laurence, and ask him to come home?\" said Max. \" No, thank you,\" she returned ; \" he is quite happy - \u2014 happier where he is.\" He left her standing by the fire, with the note still in her hand. A horrible foreboding of he knew not what was upon him. He knew several places at which"], [312, "304 RETRIBUTION. he might find Laurence Vanlyn ; but he feared to do so, for Enid's sake. He looked at his watch ; it was only just eleven. He jumped into a cab, and drove straight to Empress Gate. There was a chance that Summerly might be at home, and from him help was possible. CHAPTER XXXIX. RETRIBUTION. Fortunately Summerly was at home. He looked a little surprised when Max came in. \" Is there anything the matter ?\" he said quickly. \" Yes,\" returned Max. \" Do you know where Van lyn is ?\" \"I know where he was,\" replied Mr. Summerly, \"where he very often is \u2014 in the green-room at the Frivolity. I came across one of his kindred spirits not an hour ago, and he gave me the pleasing intelli gence.\" \"I suspected as much,\" said Max. \"I was with Enid ten minutes ago, and she knows where he is, too.\" \"Good Lord!\" \" The blackguard left a note in the fireplace, and she found it. She was very brave, and bore the dis covery wonderfully ; but she is suffering, in spite of that.\" \" Did she tell you what was in the note ?\""], [313, "305 RETRIBUTION. \"0 no ; she kept his secret. He would not go to the theatre with us, and had left the house when we returned. It struck me that perhaps you might find him and persuade him to go home.

Enid is not the first woman whose heart he has broken.\" \" And she will not be the last,\" said Summerly. Max brought his hand heavily down upon the table, and there was a dark look in his eyes. \" By Heaven, she shall !\" he cried. \" I would rather see her dead than see her suffering as she is now.

All her husband's harsh words and rough ways were quite accounted for now. He did not care for her \u2014 probably he never had; he married her for her money, which now had come to an end, leaving him with naught but the burden of her presence. The very thought of it nearly drove her mad. She had tried so hard to please him ; she was never cross or impatient or exacting, and yet he did not care for her, and now there was no hope that he ever would. And yet, was there really no hope ? \" I must have been to blame,\" she cried wildly, accusing herself. \" 0 merciful God, give me one more chance of winning him back !\" Even as she spoke she heard him turn the latch key in the door. She was standing by the chimney piece when he came in smoking a cigar. \" You up !\" he exclaimed in surprise. \" May I ask the cause of so flattering an attention ?\u25a0\" \" I was not sleepy, dear,\" she said gently. \"I thought I should like to sit up for you.\" \"You would have been much better in bed,\" be observed, throwing himself into a chair and yawning."], [315, "307 RETRIBUTION. \"Where is the brandy? What a fool that fellow is ! 0, there it is!\" \" May I pour it out for you, Laurie,\" she asked, \" as I used to ?\" \" Yes, if you like.\" With trembling hands she brought the glass and placed it beside him ; then she sat down on a stool at his feet. \" I want to thank you for going to Men tone,\" she said cheerfully ; \" it is so very kind of you. Max told me about it this evening. I was thinking, as I sat alone waiting for you, of the happy time we spent there before we were engaged.\" \"I can't say I care for the idea myself,\" returned Vanlyn. \"Max is so confoundedly fond of arranging other people's affairs for them.\" \"Did he arrange it?\" she said. \"I thought he only invited us to stay with him.\" \" 0, did you ?\" \" I have been thinking, dear, that when we are there I shall be able to be more of a companion to you,\" with a break in her voice. \"I am afraid I have not been quite so amusing as I might have been ; but I mean to try very hard to make up for lost time, and be bright and lively, Laurie,\" stretching out her hand to him. \" It would break my heart if you grew tired of me.\" \" What a very dramatic sentiment !\" he said, with a sneer; \"the result of the evening's entertainment, I suppose. By the bye, how do you think you would"], [316, "308 DESERTED. succeed if you took to the stage as a profession ? You have not written much lately, and I can tell you funds are coming rapidly to an end; something must be done.\" She rose and looked at him with wild miserable eyes. \" I will try to write again,\" she said, \" if you\u2014 if you wish it.\" \" Of course I wish it.\" She came a step nearer. \"Have you not one kind word to say to me?\" she cried piteously \u2014 \"just one!\" \" I have three,\" he returned. \" They are \u2014 go to bed.\" She half staggered across the room to the door, and stumbled blindly up-stairs. CHiVPTER XL. DESERTED. For a long time after Enid left him Laurence Vanlyn sat smoking and thinking. The fire crackled and blazed, the wind whistled and howled, gradually the traffic grew less, and only au occasional passing cab broke the silence. Then another sound fell on his ear \u2014 the old horrible haunting phantom that had well-nigh driven him to despair. Like a wail it came through the still-"], [317, "309 DESERTED. ness of the night : \" Ah, che la morte ! Ah, che la niorte !\" He listened with dilated eyes; slowly he turned his head and listened still. With trembling hands he wiped the beads of perspiration from his forehead, and spoke in a hoarse whisper, \" It will surely leave me soon,\" he said ; \" if I can keep my senses, it will leave me soon.\" He staggered to the table, and pouring out some brandy, drank it. \" Now I shall sleep,\" he said. \" I shall sleep, and hear it no more.\" But he did not sleep : he had got beyond that. He crept back to his chair by the fire and listened to the music. The horrible fascination of it had got into his brain. \" I said it would drive me mad,\" he cried; \"but it has not. 0, no ! I am not mad. I shall get the better of it at last.\" He was shaking from head *.o foot, and his teeth chattered. \" If I could only get some air,\" he gasped \u2014 \" some air!\" He rose slowly, as an old man might have risen, and tottered across the room, catching at the furniture for support in his progress. He drew aside the curtain and hesitated. \" How do I know the boy is not there ?\" he said. \"How do I know he may not be quite close against the window ?\""], [318, "310 DESERTED. The curtain dropped from his hand ; he turned away, still with the hunted look in his eyes. \" Is this madness ?\" he cried. \" Has it taken hold of me at last ? If I could only escape from the haunt ing music, I should fight it down yet. I will do it, yes, to-night; it is the only refuge.\" He sat down at the table and began to write.

It was the old story \u2014 self, self, self from first to last. He let himself quietly out of the house, and walked about for hours until it was train time. \" The comedy was played out some time ago,\" he said. \"Lately we have been acting the farce: who knows but that it may turn out a tragedy after all \u2014 a tragedy!\""], [319, "CHAPTER XLI. \" don't pity me.' Miss Summerly was alone in the breakfast-room at Empress Gate when Enid came in. If she had not known through Maxwell Lyndern of Mrs. Vanlyn's discovery on the previous night, she would have been less able to account for the change in her appearance than she now was. \" Do you know Laurie has gone ?\" she said. \"Gone where, my dear?\" exclaimed Miss Sum- merly. \"I do not know,\" she answered. \"I found a note this morning, saying good-bye.

Lau rence Vanlyn had squandered all his wife's money and then deserted her. \" I will go to Frederic,\" she said. \" He will find Mr. Lyndern and see what can be done.\" Summerly was reading the morning's paper when she came in. \"Laurence Vanlyn has gone,\" she said abruptly. \" Enid is here.\" Summerly sprang up and threw the paper on the floor. \" Gone !\" he cried \u2014 \" gone where ?\" \" Enid does not know ; she seems half-dazed. Come and speak to her.\" \" So the end has come at last,\" he said. \" I have been expecting it for some time.\" \" Surely not the end!\" repeated his sister. \" Yes,\" he returned, with conviction ; \"it istheend.\" When ho went to Enid in the breakfast-room a great pain filled his heart. Poor child ! she looked so deso late and hopeless, and yet she seemed steadfastly to fight against the certainty of despair. \" You have always been good to me,\" she said. \" I need your help more than ever now. I want you to find Laurence and ask him to come back.\" \" I will do anything in my power,\" he returned, leading her to a sofa. \" Tell me when he went away.\" With trembling bands she gave him the note. \"I found it this morning,\" she said. \" He will come back,\" a sudden wild excitement filling her eyes."], [321, "313 \" don't pity me.' \" He would have said good-bye to me if he had gone for a long time.\" \"Had you any quarrel with your husband ?\" asked Summerly, thinking it possible, under those circum stances, that Vanlyn might have temporarily left his wife as a punishment. \" No,\" she answered, raising piteous eyes to his ; \" but I have disappointed Laurie. It is all my fault ; I was never sufficiently clever for him, and lately I have not been able to write. I have always obeyed him and tried to please him, but I \u2014 have disappointed him.\" This idea was so firmly fixed in her mind as the reason for her husband's desertion of her, that it seemed useless to contradict it. \"You will stay with us, dear,\" said Miss Summerly, \"and Frederic will go to Mr. Lyndern and see what can be done.\" \" Tell Laurie I am so sorry I have disappointed him,\" said Enid. \" Say I send my love to him, and beg and pray that he will give me one more chance before he gives me up. Stay ; tell him that you left me writing, hard at work. I may go to the study, may I not, and begin ?\" He looked at her with a great compassion in his eyes. \" Yes,\" he said. \" 0 yes.\" For hours after he had gone she sat with the pen in her hand, drawing all kinds of things on the paper, but never writing a word ; and Miss Summerly watched her silently."], [322, "314 \"don't pity me.\" \" I cannot think,\" said Enid, once putting her hand to her head. \" I don't know how to begin. There is a terrible noise in my head.\" Miss Summerly rose, and went to her. \" Don't try, my dear,\" she said ; \" give it up, and don't try.\" \" When Laurie comes back be will say, ' Well, Enid, how about your promise ? let me see what you have written ;' and I shall say ' Nothing.' 0, if I could only think \u2014 if I could only think !\" She was silent again for a time, and Miss Sum merly thought she was asleep. A movement at the table made her turn with a start. Enid was standing up, looking at the papers before her with a stony despairing gaze, and her face was as it looked last night \u2014 all gray and drawn. \"It is no use,\" she said, in a dull monotone ; \"I have failed.\" She left the table, and came to Miss Summerly \" Shall I tell you something?\" she said. \"Laurie will never come back. I knew it this morning, but I could not let myself believe it. I would not let you believe it; but it is quite true.\" \" Enid !\" cried her companion ; \" Enid, don't look like that ! Frederic is not home yet ; he may bring some cheering news.\" \" It is quite hopeless,\" she returned, with convic tion ; \" you will see it is.\" She sat down and folded her white hands together, remaining perfectly still. At last Mr. Summerly returned. She never raised"], [323, "\" don't pity me.' 315 her head when he came in, and she never spoke. It was Miss Summerly who asked for the news. \" Lyndern and I have not heard anything of Vanlyn so far,\" he said, trying to speak cheerfully. \" Lyndern is still making inquiries. No doubt we shall hear something soon.\" \" No doubt,\" returned his sister. They might have been a hundred miles away for all the notice Enid took of them. Now she had once ad mitted the certainty of her husband's desertion, she struggled no longer, but gave up completely and utterly. Sound did not reach her ; all she did was mechanical, and without thought. When Miss Summerly led her into the other room she made no demur, and she never spoke. It was intensely piteous to see this meek, voiceless despair; ten times more so than the wildest grief. \" She was not like this when her father died,\" said Summerly. \" She was natural, and \u2014 cried. I would give the world to see her cry now.\" About eight o'clock in the evening some one sent for him. He went into the study, and found Max standing by the table. On it lay poor Enid's pitiful attempt to fulfil her promise to her husband. It was just as she had left it, with the queer characters traced upon it, and the pen beside it. \" I have heard of Vanlyn,\" said Max abruptly. \" I came to tell you the \u2014 the news.\" \" Sit down,\" said Summerly; \" you look worn out.\" \" It is very horrible,\" said Max ; \" he is dead.\" \"Good Lord!\""], [324, "316 \" don't pity me.\" \" I went to all the places at which we thought it possible he might be found, but could hear nothing. About half an hour ago I went up to his house, to see if the servants bad heard anything, and found them in the wildest excitemeut. It seems they had just heard that Vanlyn was killed. In trying to get into the train as it was going on he lost his footing, and got dragged down and completely smashed. An envelope was found in his pocket, with his address.\" \" So that is the end,\" said Summerly. Max turned sharply round. \" Who is to tell her ?\" he asked. \"God only knows how she will bear it; the thought of it has been haunting me like a night mare.\" \" Will you tell her ?\" asked Summerly. Max covered his face with his hands. \" I can't,\" he said ; \" don't ask me. I can't.' \" I think she is past being affected by any news now,\" returned his companion. \"For hours she has been perfectly quiet, never speaking and never moving, unless she is obliged. She seems to have given up thinking or comprehending, with a settled despair in her face that it breaks one's heart to see.\" Max rose, and paced the room. \"If that is the effect of his leaving her,\" he said, \" what will be the effect when she knows he is dead ?\" \"I think she knows it now,\" returned Summerly. \" I think when she so completely gave up hope, some thing told her he was dead,\""], [325, "CHAPTER XLII. \" MY WORK IS DONE.' Laurence Vanlyn had been buried a week, and since his death Max had not seen Enid. He stead fastly refused to do so ; and she had never asked for him or for any one. Nothing mattered to her ; she was very gentle and obedient, doing all they asked her. When she answered them she spoke in a whisper ; she smiled often in a weird, piteous way, never speaking of her husband, never crying, never lament ing ; simply living on and enduring. Summerly was alone in the library when Max came in. It was evening, and he had left his sister and Enid alone in the drawing-room. \" Ah, Lyndern,'' he said; \" I am glad to see you.\" \" Thank you,\" returned Max. \" I came to see how Enid was, and to say good-bye to you. I am going to America.\" \" America !\" Max nodded. \" Yes,\" he said ; \" my work is done. I think it best.\" \" What do you mean ?\" \"Enid needs my help no longer,\" he said. \" She is quite safe with you and your sister ; no harm can come to her. If she lives, in time she may be happy.\" \" And you ?\" \" I shall do. There is one thing I want you to do for me, if you will.\""], [326, "318 \" MY WORK IS DONE.\" \" Anything in the world, my dear fellow,\" returned Summerly, looking at the grand, brave face of the man who had endured so much and been strong. \" I want you to tell Enid that a distant connection of her father's has left her a legacy, which makes her quite independent of any work she may choose to do. I have arranged it with my lawyer, but I don't want my name to appear; if you will manage it for me, I shall be grateful for one more of the many kindnesses you have shown me.\" \" You wish her to live in ignorance of this your last act of unselfish goodness to her,\" said Summerly. \" You are going to separate yourself completely from her, and break your heart, hidden away from us in a foreign land. Have you realised that, when this grief has passed away from her, as it assuredly will, sooner or later, she will want some one to be tender and gentle to her \u2014 some one on whom she can lean, and who will protect and take care of her ? She will want you.\" \" For God's sake, don't tempt me to stay !\" cried Max. \" If she thought such an idea ever crossed my mind, she would hate me ; let me go away from temptation, and if she ever wants me you will let me know.\" \"If tempting you would make you change your mind,\" said Summerly, \" I would never rest until I had done it.\" \"It would only make the inevitable harder to bear,\" he returned. \" I know it is best.\" Suddenly he rose and went to the table."], [327, "\" MY WORK IS DONE.\" 319 \" There is another thing I think I ought to tell you,\" he said; \"I have been debating about it, and have decided it is best you should know it. Vanlyn was married six years ago in Italy to a violinist, called Signora Gitana.\" \" You do not mean that Enid \u2014 \" \" His first wife was dead before he married Enid,\" said Max ; \" she was murdered by Laurence Vanlyn.\" \" How did you hear this?\" \" From the boy who threw the rope into Vanlyn's carriage the day he was married. This boy was a protege of Signora Gitana, and very devoted to her. Laurence Vanlyn got tired of his first wife as he did of his second ; and on the night before he drowned her, he said in this boy's presence that he would rather die than endure to be haunted by the recollection of a crime, or live over a mine which at any moment might be sprung. This idea seems to have struck Flippo very forcibly. On the night before Vanlyn was to start for England, he proposed taking his wife for a row. Flippo heard the arrangement, and ran off to the beach, hiding himself in the boat. Poor Gitana took her violin, and as the boat left the shore she played 'Ah, che la morte !' You should hear the boy describe the scene ; how the weird melancholy music swept across the waters ; and how Vanlyn kept his face, with a desperate look upon it, turned away from his companion. Then the struggle, the terrible cry that broke from her lips as the waters closed over her \u2014 it is all too horrible to think or speak of. The child managed to cling to"], [328, "320 \"my work is done.\" the boat in some mysterious way, and a passing boat picked him up. He has led a precarious life, but all through it his one idea has been to avenge Gitana's death. Day and night he has haunted Vanlyn, and made his life torture. I tried everything I could to induce him to give it up, but he would not.\" \"And now?\" \" Now he is satisfied. He accepted my offer since Vanlyn died to send him back to Italy, and he has already started ; I do not think you will ever hear of him again.\" \"I am glad you have told me about it,\" said Sum merly. \" What a horrible life Vanlyn's must have been ! His punishment was almost as terrible as his crime.\" \"It was terrible,\" said Max; \" in this world it has come to an end.\" They were silent for some minutes, then Max said, \"Do you think I could see Enid for a minute with out her seeing me ? I should like to do so before I go.\" \" She is probably asleep now, and if so, it could be managed quite easily,\" returned Summerly ; and then he went out of the room and left Max alone. When he came back with his sister, Max was sitting with his face buried in his hands : he raised it as they entered the room. \"I cannot believe you are going to leave us,\" said Miss Summerly; \"it seems so sudden, and \u2014 we shall miss you.\""], [329, "321 MY WORK IS DONE. \" Thank you,\" he returned gratefully ; \" I shall never forget your goodness to me and \u2014 and Enid.

There was no light in the room save the ruddy glow of the firelight. Not a sound but the ticking of the clock broke the silence. On the sofa lay Enid. He came on very softly till he stood quite close to her, and then he stopped. In spite of her terribly sad life, she looked only a girl even now : her pretty golden hair lay scattered over the pillow, and the firelight played upon it, mak ing many shadows and shades. Her black dress, so like the one in which he first saw her, clung about her, and made her pale face look paler by contrast ; one arm was thrown above her head, and the other hung down by her side. He still stood looking at her, recalling the times when he had seen her happy and heard her laugh, and then involuntarily stretched out his hands to her Y"], [330, "322 MY WORK IS DONE. in mute appeal, and bending over, raised a piece of hair to his lips. \" It was mine once,\" he thought ; \" Heaven help me, it was mine !\" After a few minutes he returned to the library. \" How do you think she looks ?\" inquired Miss Summerly anxiously. \"She looks ill and sad,\" he returned; \"she re minds me of the time when I first saw her.\" There was a little pause, then he held out his hand. \"Good-bye,\" he said; \"good-bye, and thank you.\" \"Not yet?\" cried Summerly; \"you are not going yet ?\" \"I start to-morrow morning,\" he answered. \"I think I am better able to say good-bye now than I shall be in ten minutes' time.\" \" I wish you had not made us care so much for you,\" said Miss Summerly, \" or else that we could per suade you to stay.\" \" Don't say any more kind things to me,\" returned Max. And then he shook hands with them and went away, and they knew they were poorer by the loss of one brave true heart than they had ever been before. \" Don't talk to me of the paltry vanity the world calls love,\" said Summerly, looking after him ; \" don't tell me that the selfish thing which has adopted the name is love at all.

He dies gloriously, and he dies in tri umph. The hills reflect his glory, and the lake returns his parting smile. The girl in the boat has stopped rowing, and is resting on her oars, watching the scene dreamily. \" Don't over-exert yourself,\" remarks a voice from the bank. She starts from her reverie, looks back over her shoulder, and smiles. \"Don't be satirical at my expense,\" she says. \"It is too hot to be anything but lazy. Come and try it.\" \" I should be most happy, if you will row to the bank.\" \" Where is Miss Summerly ?\" \"Asleep in the garden. I thought I would not disturb her.\" \" And consequently set forth with the laudable in tention of disturbing me instead.\" \" Precisely.\" She rows towards the bank. \"You ought to have come ten minutes ago,\" she says. \" I was watching the sunset. It was very won derful.\" He gets into the boat, and takes the oars from her. \" I wish I had,\" he returns. \" Do you remember how much you used to enjoy the sunsets when you were in the Fens ?\""], [333, "325 YEARS AFTER.

People think a good deal of it, I believe.\" \" Probably because they have little else that is beautiful to look at.\" She sits thinking for a few minutes. \" If any one had done you a great wrong,\" she says at length, \" would you be glad to know she was punished ?\" \"I have not been tried; but I daresay I might be,\" he returned. \" We are not all like King Arthur.\" \" King Arthur was more than mortal.\" \"O yes; quite idealistic, of course,\" says Sum merly. \" There is no real generosity or unselfishness in any human being. We manage to palm off some thing which goes by the name ; but it is not in the least genuine.\" \" That is very bitter, and I do not believe it.\" \" I beg your pardon.

Two years and a half is a long time to be away,\" she answers. \" We shall probably never see him again.\" \" Perhaps he will come home with a wife one of these days,\" suggests Summerly cheerfully. \"I have often thought of that,\" says Enid. \"I think of it nearly every day. I hope he will marry some one nice and clever.\" She leans over the boat, and lets the water ripple through her fingers. \" The chances are that he will marry an empty headed doll with a pretty face, who will bore him fright fully,\" says Summerly, smiling. \"Don't!\" she cries, with a catch in her voice. \"I cannot bear to think of his whole life being spoiled.

They walk slowly back to the house together. Most of the way Enid is very quiet ; when they are nearly home her mood changes. \" How used we have become to this quiet life !\" she says. \" Can you believe that for nearly three years we have ruralised in Wales, and been at peace ?\" \" Shall you be sorry to go?\" \" 0, terribly sorry. I am educated up to appre ciating a quiet life now. I shrink from the idea of gaiety again.\" \" Nevertheless, now you are quite well and strong, a change will be good for you.

You deserve to be sorry for the remainder of your life, if you are unappreciative enough to leave it.\" Suddenly, from among the trees, they see Miss Summerly coming towards them. \" How dreadfully pleased you look !\" cries Enid. \" Have you discovered a gold-mine in the back garden ?"], [336, "328 TEARS AFTER.

It is quite dusk, but the windows are open, and the sweet scent of flowers fills the room. Some one is standing by the chimney-piece, some one who comes quickly forward with outstretched hands. \" Max !\" she exclaims ; \" is it possible you have come back to us at last?\" \" Yes,\" he returns rather unsteadily. \" They told me you were stronger and better, and I wanted to see if it were true.\" \" It is quite true,\" she returns, putting her hands in his. \" And you ?

I have carried the image of your face as I last saw it, all white and drawn like the face of a dead girl, about with me these terrible years, till the recollection of it nearly drove me mad. They wrote often to me, and said you were gradually getting better ; and I tried to believe them ; and lately they said you were happy, like your old self again, and that you often talked about me, and sometimes wanted me.\" \"Mr. Summerly is the most treacherous man I know,\" says Enid, smiling ; \" he tells tales without the slightest compunction.\" \" Then you did not want me ?\" \" Max !\" \" I thought perhaps it was a society sentiment,\" says Max, smiling. \"No, you did not,\" she returns. \"I have done"], [339, "YEARS AFTER. 331 with society sentiments.
