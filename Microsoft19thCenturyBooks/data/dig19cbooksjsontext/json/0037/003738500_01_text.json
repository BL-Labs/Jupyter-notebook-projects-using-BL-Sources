[[1, ""], [2, ""], [3, "\"TOUGH, BUT TRUE,\" BY WILLIAM A. URIE. PjTis\u00a7r% HIS illustration of facts is a Poetical Tirade against every one who has 'ftil^ft and those who are still, making large and speedy fortunes by defrauding tie (j^ick ' British Seamen, by their cunning and sordid actions, which they at all time* display towards them. In the first instance it was composed by the Author with the view of benefiting and improving the present very bad condition of that very much despised and underrated class, commonly termed \" Forecastle Sailors.\" Indeed, the Author had a story to tell, and he has told it in a mostinimitable and lucid style. Tho tale is a harrowing one, aud told with a pathos which does justice to the cause he is advocating. Thc picture which he draws when describing the many evils which have to be endured by tbe majority of Seamen when toiling on the distant is sufficient to move a heart of Adamant. He also gives a few plain hints to those who have the power, if they only had the will, to remedy the existing grievances whioh Seamen have to contend against. He also warns all Seafarers to be on their guard against false friends, whom he terms \" Land Sharks and Vultures.\"' There is nothing unreasonable in asking justice for Seamen. Are they not human beings ? And are they not entitle 1 to the same respect as is -hewn to others of Britain's sons? Seemingly not, if what thc Author says is correct, and he certainly has had some considerable \"experience with the subject wbich he treats. To quote the Author's remarks : '* He is ready and willing, at any time, when at home, to give evidence in support of what he asserts, and he is convinced that his own experience is sufficient tD satisfy the most incredulous of mortals. Furthermore, he fearlessly challenges an examination or investigation, either publicly or privately, at any time or place, when possible, into any matter adduced by him, and the most rigorous inquiry is invited.\" Now the Author is entirely responsible for the following, which he vouches for as true : That when Seamen ask for redress for any wrong done them when abroad, their ,-n .plications are either tardily neglected or entirely ignored, and they are seldom, if ever, accorded the courtesy which is recognized in civilized Society ; but, in lieu thereof, they are invariably treated with scorn and contempt. To this circumstance we are indebted to the Author for this production of verse. The introduction to this Poem was first printed and published in the u Exp. i an Evenin\" Newspaper, published in the town of Cardiff, on the 6th of July, 1 nearly six weeks after the Author bad sent a copy of it to the Editor of \" The Western Mail,\" and to the Editor of the paper named \" Seafaring:' The Editor of \" The Western Mail\" could not see bis way clear to insert tbe Poem in the Newspaper, as there is a rule against publishine; auy kind of poetry in it, as it is a business paper, and the most Conservative in South Wales. He, the Editor, however, after over a month , delay, generously bad the Poem published in the - Egress,\" a, paper be has some interest in. The Editor of \" Seafaring \" could not find sufficient space for the insertion of the Poem in his nautical organ, nor yet did he give any reason. Why ? Of course the Poem bore \u25a0i different aspect.;o the present version, and also a different title ; in fact the Author has"], [4, "2 made some remarkable progress, aud made several astonishing alterations, since he sent the Poem entitled \"Facts, with Fancies,\" to the then Editor of \"Seafaring,\" on the 23rd of May, 18S9. This Poem has still a history to relate and some disclosures to make, for the Author, three days after the Poem, now entitled \" Tough, but True,\" appeared in the \" Express\" entrusted the manuscript of the Poem to a Lawyer, who promised to have the manuscript sent to Stationers' Hall to have it registered as a Copyright Poem, in the name and on behalf of the Author. But, evidently that _7-legal luminary has betrayed the trust which the Author placed in him, for he will neither give to the Author an account of what he did with the manuscript entrusted to his care. Neither will he con descend to acknowledge the receipt of the letters which the Author has sent him upon the subject. The Author now considers himself justified in giving publicity to an action which he considers despicable in the extreme : and, as for the il-legal perpetrator of this action so mean, the Author characterizes him as a putrid sneak, uuworthy the notice of honest men. The Author is desirous that it should be clearly understood that in his phraseology the term Seamen, as applied by him in the definite form, does not mean Masters or Officers of Ships, but merely those men who are sailing before the mast, \" Forecastle Sailors,\" as they are derisively termed. Not because the latter are in any way inferior to the former as seamen or seafaring men, but simply for the reason that the interests of the former are at variance with the interests of the latter. Therefore, they cannot be on the whole termed Seamen, when their intentions are like their interests, separate aDd distinct from those who they are by authority placed over. Now, with regard to' the experience which tbe Author has gained in eighteen years sea service with tbe usual mode of administering justice to seamen when Abroad, by Consuls, he avers that they as a rule do not give equitable justice to Seamen, for when Seamen are brought before them, upon any charge laid against them by the Master or any of the Officers of the ship which they are serving in, the balance of justice is usually in favour of the Master or Officer. Why ? Because the Master or Officer gains tbe ear of the Consul first. The same may be said with regard to any contention between Master and Officer. The better the position occupied the more favour is applied ; tbe lower tbe position the greater tbe denial of justice, for with presents of goods or a purse of gold \" Poor Sailor Jack \" like a bullock is sold. Tbe Author says, '\u25a0 In the whole term of eighteen years arduous sea-service, with one single exception, I have never seen port wine or brandy given to a sick sailor. What becomes of tbe brandy and port wine sent on board of foreign-going ships as medical stores ? \" The Author desires that it should be distinctly and definitely understood that there are four different and distinct classes of British or so-called British Shipowners, designated in the following order : \u2014 First Class. Second Class. Third Class. Fourth Class. False-hearted, never could be gentlemen \u2014 Men who promise every thing, but seldom do anything \u2014 Men whose sole ambition is to initiate themselves among the half-hearted, as the whole-hearted would never at their worst moments tolerate such deceptive beings as these men are ; for they send their vessels away threadbare, and as long as they can gee some poor unfortunate devil of a ship-master to sail them they'll never expend a cent, on their vessels' repairs, and the principal object insur- Whole - hearted, genuine, British gentle men \u2014 Men who will acknowledge a service rendered, or concede a just demand when brought before their notice \u2014 Men who never turn a deaf ear to an appeal for assistance made by the wives, widows, or children of those who have lost their lives or have been injured in their service. Half-hearted, would be if they could, gentle men \u2014 Men who take tbe advice of their subordinates in every thing \u2014 Men who have not the moral courage to act for themselves, but wait until they see others act first, then they are afraid their interests are at stake. They then make haste to take a lead along with the whole-hearted, and sometimes they shoot beyond the mark. Heartless cads, of every tribe and nation ality domiciled in Britain \u2014 Men who under-pay their ship masters, who, in their turn get a lot of in competent foreigeners, who they engage for a mere subsistence, and starve them too, as their owners send them away with their ships leaky and masts, yards and everything in the worst condition, on a twelve months' vovage with three months' pro visions. ance."], [5, "3 When Sailors join any British ship they get what is termed their \" whack.\" Now this is their scale of Provisions, laid down in black and white and issued by the Board of Trade, according to act of Parliament, cxistiug in the month of April, 1889, and required by the 30th and 31st Viet., c. 124, s. 4.

They substitute onc pound of margarine in lieu of beef and pork, From these articles of diet tliey deduct half-pound of beef and quarter-pound of pork each day, alternately. They also substitute marmalade in lieu of margarine, it being the cheapest of tbe two. They also substitute coffee for tea, it being the inferior and commoner article. They give potatoes as a substitute for flour, and they give rice as a substitute for either. Again, they have the benefit of the interest of the greater part of the earnings of seamen while serving in their ships. Is their anything more unjust than that ? Sailors get for their Sunday's breakfast half-ounce of the dirtiest coffee, which is a mixture of burnt bread with the worst kind of chicory. They got for their Sunday dinner : One pound of salted beef like leather ; God grant that every poor sailor sinner May have a sound set of teeth. They get half-a-pound of flour, Made into a kind of paste or bread, Or boiled inside a canvas bag Until it resembles lead. They get three quarts, sometimes a gallon of water, Oftener the former than the latter, The extra will neither make them cleaner nor They get one pound of hard biscuits And an eighth of an ounce of tea : Yes, they are fed excessively bad, Are these toilers on the sea. Now that is the oblation, for which all British seamen Are to shipowners under an obligation For providing them with such a generous collation. As that specified in my enumeration, And which comprises their entire Sunday ration. fatter. They get two ounces of brown sugar, often unclean, The same of Butter (that filthy margarine). Is it not a dire disgrace to such a highly civilized, progressive, powerful nation ?"], [6, ""], [7, "\"TOUGH, BUT TRUE/' BY \"W_ .A..

Then examine the food which they oft-times provide, And consider if 'tis fit for any human being's inside ; I am sure, sirs, to the contrary yon all would decide, If so, sirs, your opinions with mine would coincide; But should your ideas with mine not agree Some yarns, sir, are so tough and so hard to digest, That some people reject \u2014 yea they scorn and detest Those very yarns which are truest and best; And accept as Gospel truth those yarns which are of I certainly would not oonsider you friends of the hard toiling sons of tin- sea, the least consequence, As they could bear no kind of strain if put to thc test. You may consider my yarns, sir, rather startling news, And, although they may not meet with your entire And I know very well your opinions they'd deride, For they'd east them with scorn far, far, to one side approval, Nor yet agree with your views ; yet to you and the whole world, sir, We have huts on board ships with very high-sounding appellations A\\ Inch are as distinct in character as they are in I offer as an honourable, truthful excuse, my object to be to instruct, not to amuse, relations Tothose mansions on shore with their superb habitations, .\\s the King ot' the Zulus is to our Queen of nations. And to endeavour redress for to get for gross wrongs and neglect, And I, as a considerably tarred sailor, who has served in merchant ships, Men of war and whalers, will endeavour now or never To give a true account of the way we are roused about, And correct the worst kinds of abuse. Yes, I am determined to try, as my story is no lie, Indignation in just-minded people to infuse Against those dastardly acts, which are the most startling facts, Contained in this small book of rational views ; And although to many stale may be the news Yet 'tis right inquiry to invite When such infamous deeds by sheer cowardice and and served with accommodations, And the manv evils we have to endure, Which you may be very sure is almost the same in all ships' forecastles, In appearance, to truth a strict adherence, They resemble hen-coops, cells, or stables, Being devoid of such necessaries as chairs, stools, or envious greed, Without meed or without need, are perpetrated on whok British ships crews. tables. They are neither fit for man or beast, As often the water is up to our knees at least, And coming down through the deck, and in through So while spinning my yarns, sirs, I would have yon to know That should vou on board ship have occasion to go To test bv experience, just ask some one you to show The hole they\u2014 ship owners and others\u2014 thmk good enough a poor sailor to stow. the door, Washing everything within all over the floor ; Destroying our clothing, and very much more, Sueh a state of things I sadly deplore."], [8, "6 Although the pork is flat and flabby, for good pig is very rare, We have to cut it up in portions small, so that each man may have his share ; And the beef\u2014 Why, 'tis salter than the pickle, Yes, and tougher than any kind of hide, Yet of it we get so little that we are forced by the very strictest measure even it to divide. Then they are filthy and dirty, and as dark as a gaol, And if you examine them closely to get every detail, It will then become obvious, which you will learn without fail, That there is not room to swing a rat around, by its tail. Then there is in many steam boats' forecastles either a hatch or a door, Either in the bulk's head or under the floor, Leading to the fore peak or to some stinking store Where they keep the provisions and cordage, and a great deal more ; And if they want paint, tar, pitch, or okum, don't think I am joking, Or only oil, a block, or a line, They make it a study to get what they want at every meal time. 'Tis also a 'shame and disgrace, to you I'll confide, The food a great many petty ship-owners provide, And which by Act of Parliament \u2014 they say- \u2014 they are compelled to abide, yes, and obey ; But you know, sirs, ship-owners are generous, And for poor sailor Jack their sympathies are wide. Why, don't you know sirs, their daughters so love Jack Tbat they often present him with a Church of England or some other religions tract. They have a desire to save his soul, For without such a considerate act 'Tis a well-kown fact, yes, and much truer by far than a Church of England tract, Or truer than the head 'neath the star on or off a Roman Cardinal's hat, That the food store-keepers send to their brave and generous friend, the gallant British tar. Is the worst sort of its kind, But ship-owners do not mind, But to sailors' grievances they are either deaf or blind, And by swearing what is bad is good, And praising Mr. J for sending the best of food, Ship-masters get pampered and fed, While poor Jack gets starved and bled, Deny it they can, they will, But I swear they do not care what sort of food does a poor sailors stomach fill, As they get the best fare off the bill. Why. I have seen food served out to seamen, Morning, noon and evening, no deceiving, In such a putrified state, sad to relate. That, if known, no Christ-ye- an would offer the like to a hungry dog or to a starving man. A sailor would neither raise sheet or tack But would go straightway all full or aback, With a splintered mast or broken boom, To that dismal hole beyond the tomb ; W ith some old sailors, by reason of some derangement in their dental apparatus, Which generally is a softened gum or still softer And their good fathers act towards Jack with great kindness, as you are aware, For they are so afflicted with pocket-studied blindness, And, as they are so afflicted, they persist, I declare, In giving their seamen the very worst and cheapest of fare ; But 'tis baked, boiled, and spoiled, and made into the Devil's own mash, Then its slashed, dashed and squashed into the Strangest of fash, And served out to sailors and called \" darned \u00b0-0od hash.\" The teas, like the coffee, the rice and the peas, Are musty and fusty, and have a very unpalatable taste, Beef, butter, and sugar are both bad* and scarce, As some ship-masters will admit when they think fit ; But the stewards will tell you to your face \u2014 I fear seamen will never get good or sufficient food, Unless they get from heaven a special act of grace. Surely members of Parliament, with their political rant, Could make some alterations in some of those vile Acts masticators, 'Tis with them a forced affair, although 'tis called a hobby. V, hen they drink their water spliced with rum, And eat a mixture of their own, by gum. Now, sirs, just try and view this picture: Pea-soup, beef or pork, with biscuits, all a mixture. Which, when stowed in man's inside Becomes a perfect solid fixture. Such another compound could hardly be found, And no ship-owner would relish it I'll be bound ; Yet seamen are by such scanty fare at times almost driven to dispair, Their allowance of fare is so very bare, And when weighed out, or when on their whack, The stewards have a dishonest knack of serving out less than the prescribed act, Thus the necessity for such a fobby or hobby As to compound a mixture so rare, Which is made from the little they can spare, And deservedly named dog's body. of past Parliaments. They must be void of all feeling and honest dealing, Or else they would begin to fulfil some of their promises made before we put those members in ; For our biscuits are just as hard as flint. And before we can stow them our insides in, We have to get them softened with aid and dint There is at times on board of some British ships A class of blackguardly and bossing snips, Who are a confirmed lot of boosers, And, as they are the masters or officers, they are also of an iron belaying pin the choosers;"], [9, "7 And those men, believe mo. sirs, for 'tis true, And, considering the risk we run by night and by day, There is no class of men worse fed or getting worse pay, And the treatment we almost everywhere receive Scarcely anyone, sir3, can believe, Would sooner have Dutchmen or dagos for their crew. And all kinds of foreign rabble at their back. Than say an honest word in behalf of their countryman, poor Jack. And from the commencement of the voyage, and on the passage back, It's always if you don't do this or that we'll put you on your whack. You may laugh, sirs, but by jove it is a solemn fact, They are continually telling their countrymen That next voyage they arc going to have all Dutchmen, And every Englishman must and will get the sack. For very few will take a sailor's part; Yet the cruelty I have seen on board several ships where I have been Has often struck me as with a dart, And sent my bloo.l with indignation coursing through my heart. Then when we are on shore We have to suffer as much or more ; Now judge, sirs, how we feel Toward those whom we have everywhere to deal, You, sirs, can imagine, although I cannot here relate, The reason why seamen against so many have so often to retaliate. There is a few ship-owners, but I am very glad to say They are only petty ones who are on the saving lay. For they devise all kinds of tricks to get sailors to sail But such men as them I scarcely need particularise. Although they try by every means and method over poor sailors to tyrannize But you can rely, and they'll find out bye-and-bye, That such petty spiteful actions most British seamen honestly despise, Nor will they stand sueh treatment long, nor yet be those puttied officer's guys, For thc finale to such treatment is \u2014 the crew they tar away. In their rotton-bottomed ships without leaving their wives and families half-pay : Ami I am sure they wood if they possibly could Engage sailors to serve them without giving them either clothing or food. mutinise. Of course, sirs, there is exceptions to the above rule \u2014 Men who are not given to brutality or deception, And I have met with sucb a case Whore the master was one of the good old school, He scorned to be made a ship-owner's tool. Though poor hc sprang from an independent race, And kindness beamed in his weather-worn face. May the God of right speedily send Many likc him, a true si.ilor friend, For he did all he could, a good deal more than many And if they could get all they desire British seamen to serve them without paying them hire, Now don't be surprised, for I certainly have no occasion to doubt That they would man:, their ships with foreigners throughout. And send their own conntrymen to h 1 the shortest way about. They think themselves right, but they are wrong in the sight of every impartial or right thinking man, Although they delight in showing their might By doing us all the harm that they can. They cannot deny it, although they still defy it ; That this state of affairs, if the Lord answers prayer, would, His seamen for to please, not hunger and ease, But plenty of good palatable food their hunger to appease. Well, sirs, for being so kind and humane \u2014 And this is one of Ship-owners' tricks \u2014 Just as soon as thc ship came home, After all his care on the treacherous foam, This good old man, to tbe owners' shame, Although it did not trouble him a bit Got notice to look out for ar.other ship, Which they know very well is wholly wrong, Will soon meet its doom by those very ones whom they have held in bondage so long. To churches, charities and missions they freely give, For without a show of mock religion how could they exist or live ; And I scorn to give such a ship-owner name. There are many ship-owners worse than jews, \u2014 frauds, nothing\" new : may the devil interview. Yet to sailors' widows or orphans they so very little give That 'tis very little known, you must own, But the blame rests on their false teachers and the Yes, and ship-masters too. Who think their ship manned when they only carry half a crew. May such ship-owners be d d And their ship-masters be hanged Until every man jack becomes two seeds which they have sown, And bv their villainous teachings ship-owners hearts have harder grown. They teach them for to trust in God, the Creed and Corrmandments to believe, Indeed, their religious principles are as holy as the sieve. But there is no cause to wonder they carry so few, For one seaman has more work in his situation than any two landsmen would be asked to do ; _ No matter' whatever mav be their trade or occupation, And betwixt shipping-masters at home and Consuls They are also taught 'tis just and right To keep their purse-string tight, And study all kinds of roguery from morning until night abroad , . , ve to submit to a great deal of d- a irauci,"], [10, "8 To submit to her rules, hercouilitiins ami laws.

To drive us from our doors, And, with their promises and cant, They have tried hard to supplant The only true defenders of our native shore, And if _ve dont soon call a halt, They will quickly have all they want, Then they'll bid farewell to Britain for ever more, For when from their country they came away, In Deutschlaudich they were beard to say \u2014 And a little more control over what we now contract, And over some of the inserted clauses made. By members of the present marine Board of Trade. I think members of Parliament might contrive, Some better clauses in our articles to enact, For how can seamen or ship-owners thrive, When there is neither law, justice or equity, In the existing Merchant Shipping Act. The following is in the High Deutschlander Lingo, Lassen wir, Deutschland, Verkssen For 'tis very well known, Ancl every one of experience will own, That a sailor, to gain a little favour, Has very often to labour over sixteen hours per day. Now my case I'll make out quite clear, And I don't think I need have any fear, We haben nix mit su bringen, Undghen uber nach England, Ura reightum su machen, Whan Wil ha hen eine part, Von der weldt, As der Keighden. Englander, Lassen wir nach dat arme.

But there is a class of men who truly bave no And we will cross over to England our fortune to make ; Then when we have shares of the wealth of the rich Englander, We'll return to our poor country and spend it Like a true Fatherlander. ambition, Bather than difficulties encounter they'd bide behind the bush, And for to try and better their very sad condition 'tis scarcely any kind of use. For to their benefactors tbey give the worst kind of Now, sirs, it should be every one's endeavour, Every villainous act to sever. And from every tyrant to deliver. His poor, despised, neglected seafaring brother. And assist him in every just and legal claim, Then justice, truth, and honesty would ever and always be their aim. abuse Those men are a curse upon every succeeding age, And tbeir conduct is a blot upon our history page. But they are of small account or they would not now Although there has been many men, good and daring, Who have raised their voice on behalf of the brave engage To under-sell tbeir fellow-man, by shipping under seafaring. wage. And many have, with a courageous choice, Endeavoured to free us from the fetters we have long been bearing, And to attain that end of their wealth they were not Tbere is also ship-owners of a certain sect or class, Wbicb in tbis rhythm of mine I will not slip or pass, As they are, and have always been, Tbe worst enemies our nation has ever seen. Tben why should I their intentions screen ? When tbey are sordid enemies to our cause, Then reckon the cost if, through them, our country's prestige should be lost ; Then reckon their gain, if they only half obtain Our country's ruination or invasion, Which seems to me to be their principal occupation. But, praise the Lord, for they are not the sons of British soil, No ! tbey left their own ours to despoil. Yes, and many British workmen for those fellows toil, They are the sous of those Continental scums, Who have brought so many foreign bums sparing ; Yet, still the wrong goes railing along. For the contest is quite unequal. What will be the sequel ? \u2014 The poor, the weak, against the rich and strong. Our strength, our manhood, we out are wearing, But the profits of our employers \u2014 the ship owners \u2014 few, very lew, are sharing. And we are almost, almost despairing, of for ever faring, Like slaves \u2014 poor, poor old whales. There is established what is termed an National Amal- gamated Sailors' and Fire-men's Union Which, if conducted aright, might be a benefit to the seafaring communion,"], [12, "10 And a guiding star for the future elevation of our young and rising generation, Of British sailor-men and trusty tars \u2014 for with their plucky determination, And further advancement in education, If a foreign foe were seeking, our country to invade- Or, if they were trying to deprive us of our trade. This plea I now send forth around Great Britain's coast, They would never suffer annihilation, As they will be a credit to our grand old British Nation. To every British seafaring man to haste and form a union true, As every free man has a right to do. But from every kind of violence please abstain, Then you very soon will see, when you all united be, Employment you will get, and employers they will For they will resent, as is a Briton's bent, and cause any proposers to repent, Of any kind of separation, or political persuasion, or \" tyrannical oppression, Which would cause our country's devastation. 1 ask every honest community To give assistance and respect to every true sailor's unity, And give employment to every honest British tar, then tbere would not have to be, you respect, Better food and payment from ship-owners you'll obtain. What pleasure would tbere then be in many British homes again, If ship-owners would only give sufficient for a man and his family that they in decency might li ve, As they only pay a very meagre sum for the work which is so dangerously done, Through sunshine, wind and rain, by their toilers on the main. In this dear land of the free, so many able men looking for homes across the sea.

And clap the break upon so much foreign importa- The breach it may be broken, or receive a violent bend, And when the truth is plainly spoken the breach may prove very hard to mend. Now this is my opinion, and on it you may depend, That those who now scorn and despitefully use us, And employment still refuse us, Will yet yet find it hard our services to obtain, And upon themselves will rest the blame \u2014 For, according to our creed, should their come a day of need, tion, For really no foreigner can honestly be any benefit to our great nation, And I hope British employers of labour will view this situation. Aud we will give our word of honour, after due con- sideration, And now. without the slightest hesitation, that we will engage against all kinds of opposition, Especially against foreign competition. \"Which has so badly crippled all our trade, And we will always endeavour to maintain that proud and noble boast For their cowardice and greed, Their overtures we'll despise, Although many plans they may devise. Just now, in time of peace, foreigners they employ, and British seamen they defy ; Which was and is a Briton's toast, But tbe time it may soon come, when they'll have to jump or run, And tben they will find out, when enemies are round And what our British fathers made, and \u2014 often with pride \u2014 tbey have sung or said Before they were in silence laid. about, How much they can upon their foreign friend rely. That our British ships are best, Aud will always bear the crest, Although our colours are from war at rest We can yet show to all the world, Whither our sails are set or furl'd, Sailors, to yourselves stand firm and true, As only can a British crew. Let your actions prove your claim. Worthy of a noble aim \u2014 worthy of a Baton's name. Struggle onwards with might and main. With an energy which will gain you fame, Until your foes are forced to proclaim That British seamen, by their honourable spirit, Have attanied the goal distinguished by tbeir merit. That the truth can never be annuled from that stirrinsr song, Which has made our nation strong, And which the children of Sandy, of Taffy and Paddy, And the renowned Johnny Bull, bave so lustily sang at school, That Britannia still bears rule o'er the waves, And-her sons will ne'er be slaves, Beware of those who pose as sailors' friends.

Of a strict investigation. Thus their doings are hid from sight, In the darkened gloom of a moonless night. They form a part of that tribe who would have you believe, Although like yourselves they are the sons of poor Eve. That their blood it is blue, although no bluer in hue Than the blood of mountain goats ; Yet they'd like to soar jja3 high l^ere they die as the birds which floats Watching their chance to pick your bones. Why, I know of one -a lawyer\u2014 named J. H .J s Do not to him an action trust, Or you'll be like a worn-out boiler\u2014 likely to be burst. Search for those who are honourable and just, And prove them, before you anything to them entrust, For promises with some Are as worthless as a broken gun ; So you cau take my honest tip, Unless you want for to get bit, That you'll never get the truth From any dishonest lawyers lip. So to end a long tirade, Let us pray that just laws may be made, Then we need not be afraid To its aerial habitation, And to this end they use all kinds of suave persuasions, The ignorant to mislead and the weak to subdue, And they spring the same boom upon all others too, To get for tlie*_nselves more than, what is their due, And cause you to acknowledge against your inclination That they are born, begotten or have sprung From some superior earthly or ethereal creation, But bury such nonsensical misleading stuff, For of such trash we've heard more than enough, And while vou dig, dig deep enough and raise a great conflagration, To escort the same with a fiery flame Down the dismal lane which leads to eternal damnation. Of any one occupying a higher grade. There is only one thing on which a seaman can with confidence depend, And with plenty of it he can purchase many a spurious friend : That is gold, a substance harder to borrow than to spend, Easier to break than to mend. Sailors be careful, keep watch and ward, To your own interests pay due regard ; Against deceitful villains be on your guard, And against tbeir evil designs, although clever, strike mighty hard ; For in your own hands you hold tbe winning card. Eise, awake fom your somnolent state, before 'tis too late I appeal to you. my sailor friends, That you will defend every just and honest view, Which this rhyme of mine has given to yon ; And I hope my wrong views you will strive to mend. May the God of justice guard us and defend, And to seamen speedily send The day when for all our wrongs we'll get redress, For we have suffered long, and long we've been oppressed. But the only method which we have a present, Which I hope will never never be lessened, Is to give our grievance publicity, Not by an emissary, But through the medium and the freedom of the Press. And with one accord let your voices against tyranny and infamy be heard. Justice and honour will conquer, so do not fear To cause every wrong-doer to appear And answer all interrogations As many plead they have done no wrong, And hide themselves with tbe usual song, Muttered in a minor tone, that they have acted right all along ; But these are vague shouts, To give, to live and let live, When for gross amounts and false accounts They seen\"; so absent-minded, To be left unminded, unguided or unbinded. If for their acts they can prove justification They need not fear a strict unbiassed examination, So let them come: VYhy do they show such hesitation By offering up all kinds of excuse, and hiding them- selves in evasion ?

WILLIAM A. URIE. Seamen ! You are one hundred thousand strong, Of a strong and mighty nation, and you have suffered many a grievous wrong, Far too long, From men of wealth who bold a false position, Especially from those who have received a churchified erroneous education ; For many poor fools they have deceived, But few of their victims they have ever relieved, When once broke down by their slavish moils, Which ends in degradation. Yet, those mean, despicable, grasping, foppish tools, Whose actions I hold in utter detestation, As there are very few who could staud and fight against | the glaring light Men whose actions or antecedents Cannot bear tbe pressure of an honest, upright examination Would better be sent to their usual lair Than kept in luxury by honest seamen's hard-earned fare. Sailors, to every favourable report Brought forward for your consideration ; Do not treat it with scorn, contempt, nor whimsical sport, Nor with foolish neglect or evasion ;"], [14, "12 But with all their great blow, demonstrations and vain show, They have shewn no ability worthy the name, To gain them respect, honour or fame, Nor yet have they made any impression, Which ought to learn them a lesson, That they have really made what they can't evade That is a very hard break. And 'tis time for them to make a shape, or else they'll be rather late, As the wronged seldom give time for their foes to But give it your honest loyal support anl earnest attention, And if need bc cause a strict honourable investigation And do^'t be led astray by or with a few ambitious men's domineering sway, Nor yet by their bombastic orations, for they falsely state, And this statement I fearlessly make, that tbey surely are lobouring under some peculiar dilemma Or some intended mistake, Which I think it is high time for us to obliterate ; So to give the initiative I don't hesitate to say That thr.se men's sole object is a fortune to make Off the earnings of poor seamen, which they try bard to rake, when they lay upon seamen large sums they have (mis) spent They forget to add to borrowed and lent For I like others paid on this particular occasion with eager intent. recuperate. I, for one, don't take a bite at their Parliamentary bait, But their bait, if it take, may be kindly meant, Still I hope, by the weight of their baite, that their books will be bent, And those who baited tbe hooks to dark Jordan be .sent As bona-fide travellers of that hot Parliament. Belief and most exultant expectations That ere tbis some good results would accrue from Give them dividers and a pair of parallel rules. To show them all seamen are not such ignorant fools As to be swindled and duped by a clique of boisterous tools. Nor yet are tbey going to be led astray, nor their our generous speculations ; But we are still in the same plight \u2014 serves us right \u2014 With regard to our food and accommodations. And although I have read and heard Some of tbeir feeble denunciations money to throw away On a fraudulent book of rules. For 'tis against the ship-owning fraternity without doubt deservedly, Tbey direct and exhaust their stock of volubility. Which you may presume rushes through an empty So give them a chart and a compass, with a sextant to boot, A pen or a pencil, witb a blank log-book To register the curves wbich they have so deviously room, Like an organ out of tune, such a mighty boom Is tbeir nautical oratory. But so far. all their tall talk is on a par with dirty smoke\u2014 wiihout fire. took While tracking tlieir course along tbat circuitous route ; And give them a chronometer to note- well the time, As I'll note it well in my very last rhyme. But I'll swear they wont pay their own fare when Now I want to kindle theirire, As ship-owners don t live by their hire, They allow their remarks like harmless sparks to - race into space. No wonder, for by thunder, going there, Neither will they return when once there. Nor yet will they return the coin which by fraud they have taken From the many hard-toiling seamen whom they have deceived and forsaken. If tbeir accounts are not all bad, worse could not be Never did seamen make su ch a blunder, And many there be who with me agree, .And pronounce it a vei*37 bad mistake to make. A i'ew grasping apostate land-sharks, To elevate to tbeir present prominent position, Which appears to gratify their boorish ambition ; But sad will be their condition. When seamen demand a return or division, By force, not by the choice of those swaggering boys Whose vain, though main object up to date, If I rightly estimate. kept, or had, By fraudulent man or lad as is-shewn by the beok. But old Jacob himself, although naturally mute, Keeps a register in bell which 'twill be hard to confute. Now, my advice is condemn, by hook or by crook Every vile action which those gentry have took, And send them away to the furthermost nook, And keep a bright eye on those fellows so cute, As well as on your Uuion, its branches and roots.
