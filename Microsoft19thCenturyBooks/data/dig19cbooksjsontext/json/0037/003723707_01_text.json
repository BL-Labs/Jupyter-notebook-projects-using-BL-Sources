The first steps towards the exploration of the country bordering on the great chain of North American lakes were taken by the Jesuits of Canada, more than two centuries ago, under the auspices of Count Frontenac, then governor general of that region. On the 7th of September, 1641, Charles Raymbault and Isaac Jogues, two missionaries of the order of Jesus \u2014 an order whoso memorials are to be found in every quarter of the habitable earth \u2014 accompanied by several i Hurons, left the bay of Pentanguishene in a bark canoe for Saut Ste. Miirie. At the head of this bay they had established a mission. It formed, at that time, the western terminus of the travelled route between Montreal and Lake Huron, by way of the Ottawa river and Lake Simcoe, and for years afterwards, while the power of France in the Northwest re- mained in the ascendant, constituted an important link in a chain of posts extending for more than two thousand miles. The route of Raymbault and Jogues lay through the Georgian bay, and thence among the countless islands that stud the channel of the St. Mary's"], [12, "Doc. No. 69. 6 river. After a voyage of seventeen days they anived at the falls (Saut,) where they found an Indian village with a population of two thousand souls. The abundance of white fish, and the facilities for capturing them in the foaming rapids, have made this the chosen resort of the Chippewas for centuries. The chiefs received them kindly and invited them to dwell in their midst. \"We will embrace you as brothers,\" they said, \"and profit by your words.\" They here learned of the existence of a lake still beyond, called by the Indians Kitchi-gummi, (Big lake,) surpassing in magnitude either Huron or Michigan, then called Illinois, beyond whose western limits was a country destitute of trees, but covered \"with grassy plains, through which roamed herds of buffalo and deer. Here dwelt the Sioux or Nadouessi, a race at once warlike and indom itable. At that day a feud existed between the two tribes, which has been perpetuated to the present time. Late in the season Raymbault returned to Pentanguishene with the in tention of revisiting the Saut in the succeeding spring, and establishing there a permanent mission; but consumption, brought on by repeated ex posures and privations, was fast hurrying him to the grave. The follow ing year he returned with Jogues to Quebec, where he died October 22, 1642. Father Jogues started to return, but in ascending the St. Lawrence was captured by the Mohawks, a predatory band infesting the shores and tributaries of Lake Erie. After having been subjected to the most igno minious treatment, himself scourged, and his Huron attendants committed to the flames, he was ultimately ransomed by the Dutch in the vicinity of Albany. He revisited France, but soon returned to the scene of his la bors with a spirit unabated and a zeal unquenched. Rene Mesnard followed in the track of Raymbault. On the 28th of August, 1660, he left Quebec, taking with him a scanty stock of neces saries; \" for I trust,\" said he, \" in that Providence which feeds the little birds of the air, and clothes the wild flowers of the desert.\" He was past the meridian of life, but possessed all the zeal of youth. vHe went forth with the presentiment that he was performing his last journey, for, in writing back to a friend, he remarked: il In three or four months you may add my name to the memento of deaths.\" Having arrived at the Saut, he proceeded to coast along the southern shore in a canoe, and on the 15th of October reached the head of Keweenaw bay, which he named St. Theresa \u2014 the day of his arrival being the anniversary day of that patron saint. Here he remained until the following spring, when he left, accompanied by a single Indian, for Chaquamegon bay, near the head of the lake. They took the route through Portage lake; and while the voyageur was conveying the canoe across the portage, thergood Father wandered into the woods, and no trace of him was afterwards obtained. This happened August 20, 1661. The world applauds the heroism of Columbus who launched out upon a trackless ocean in search of a new world. The humble missionary who, committing himself to the guidance of savage attendants, voyaged for days with a boundless waste of waters on one side, and on the other^an unbroken wilderness, showed a degree of Courage and enthusiasm which has rarely been rivalled, and which ought to rescue his name from oblivion. Claude Allouez followed in his footsteps. On the Sth of August, 1666, he embarked at Three Rivers, accompanied by four hundred Indians,"], [13, "7 Doc. No. 69. who were on their return from Quebec. In the beginning of September \u25a0 \u2022 i!..' S'.r.t, and entered Lake Superior, \"which,\" said the :: : -, shall henceforth bear the name of M. de Tracy, in 'the >b!ig;i'ioi!S the people of this region are under to him;\" and this is the name applied to it on the earliest map. '\u2022The savages,\" he continues, '-'respect this lake as a divinity, and offer 5 \u25a0\u25a0:-. ;m It lioi-'uise of its size, for it is two hundred leagues long and eighty broad, and also in consequence of its furnishing them with fish, upon which all the natives live when hunting is scarce in these quarters. , * * It happens frequently that pieces of copper are sound, weighing from ten to twenty pounds. I have seen several such pieces in the hands of savages; and since they are ver)\" superstitious, they esteem them as divinities, or as presents given to them to promote their happi ness by the gods who dwell beneath the water. For this reason they preserve these pieces of copper wrapped up with their most precious articles. In some families they have been kept for more than fifty years; in others, they have descended from time out of mind \u2014 being cherished as domestic gods. \"For some time there was seen near the shore a large rock of copper with its top rising above tlie water, which gave an opportunity to those passing by to cut pieces from it; hut when I passed that vicinity it had disappeared. I believe that the gales winch arc: hero frequent, like those \u2022f the sea, had covered it with sand. Our savages tried to pursuade me that it was a divinity who had disappeared; but for what cause they were unwilling to tell.\"* He passed the bay called by Father Mesnard St. Theresa, where he met \"two Christian women, witnesses of his (Mes nard's) labors, who had preserved their faith, and sparkled like two stars in the midst ol the darkness of infidelity. Having refreshed their memo ries with our mysteries, we proceeded on. After having travelled one hundred and eighty leagued along the border of the lake, on the southern side, where the Lord hath oftea tried our patience by means of gales, famine, and fatigue, both day and night\" \u2014 many a poor voyageur has since uttered the sa,,ie complains \u2014 ''we landed on the 1st of October at Chaquamegon.\" This is the old La Pointe of the voyageurs. He de scribes, it as a beautiful bay, on whose margin dwelt numerous savages: their warriors amounting -to eight hundred. Here he paused in his wan derings, erected a chapel* and commenced the work of winning the savages to the standard of the cross. He found that the Chippewas were meditating a warlike expedition against their ancient enemies, the Sioux. He was permitted to advise, and succeeded in diverting them from the enterprise. Here he dwelt for two years. His feme reached the sur rounding tribes, who gathered around to satisfy their curiosity and receive the benefit of his instruction. During this period he visited Fond-du-Lac, where he met with some ot the Sioux, who informed him of a coiftitry to the west abounding in prairies, over which roamed the buffalo, and that there was a great river called Messepi, (Mississippi,) whose banks were inhabited by the beaver. He extended also his mission among the Nipissiriniens, on the north shore of the lake. In the fall of 1667 he returned to Quebec to procure aid in establishing missions in the Northwest; and such was his ardor, that in two days after his arrival he was on his way back to his forest home. \"Chailevoix, in his Travels, has appropriated almost verbatim Alloii z's description."], [14, "8 Doc. No. 69. In 1668 Claude Dablon and James Marquette proceeded to Saut Ste. Marie for the purpose of establishing a permanent mission. Of the per- sonal history of the former little is known, but the latter was in the prime of life, highly educated, and fitted to adorn the court of Louis; but he sacrificed all \"of these advantages, and passed his life among a race com- paratively low in the scale of intellectual organization. From this period Saut Ste. Marie dates its settlement; and it is therefore, as Bancroft re- marks, the oldest within the limits of the State of Michigan. The following year Marquette succeeded Allouez at La Pointe, and the latter removed to Green Bay. In May, 1671, a grand council assembled at Saut Ste. Marie. The chiefs from fourteen of the tribes of the Northwest and the soldier's of France sat in council together. Mr. Tallon, then governor general of New France, had sent there Monsieur de St. Lusson to take possession, in the name of his Majesty, of all lands lying between the east and west: and from Montreal to the South sea, as far as it could be done. When assembled, the ambassador selected a hill above the village, planted the cross, and raised the arms of the King. The cross was first blessed with all the ceremonies of the Church by the Superior of the missions; and while it was being raised, the Vc.villa was chanted by the assembled Frenchmen, to the great admiration of the savages. The shield of France was suspended from a cedar post above the cross while they were chant- ing the Exaudiat, and prayers were offered for the sacred person of his Majesty. St. Lusson formally took possession of the lands; after which guns were discharged, and other manifestations of joy exhibited. Father Allouez was present, mindful of the interests of his divine as well as tem poral master.* The same year Marquette removed to St. Ignace, north of Mackinac. Here he built a chapel, and gathered about him the wander ing Hurons. Marquette and Dablon made numerous excursions to the tribes \\thieh dwelt in the territory now embraced in northern Illinois and eastern Wisconsin. Marquette, like Allouez, had heard marvellous ac counts of the region beyond the Great Lake, and longed to explore it; but* it was not until the year 1673 that he was enabled to carry his project into execution. His route lay up the Fox river, through Lake Winne- 'Alloiicz pronounced the following panegyric on the King, which is worthy of being pre served : \"It is a most important affair which calls us together. Cast your eyes on that cross, which is so high above your heads. 'Tis there where the Sun of God was willing to be attached and to die, in order to satisfy His eternal Father for your sins. He is the master of our lives, and also of heaven, and earth, and hell. It is He of whom I have so often spoken, and whose name and word I have borne into these distant lands. But, at the same time, look upon that other column, to which are attached the arms of that great cities of France, whom we call King. He lives be yond the tea. He is the chief of chiefs, ami has not his like in the world. All \"the chiefs whom you have seen, and of whom you have heard, are but childien compared wi'h him. He is like a great trie, while they are mere shrubs which we tread upon. You know Onnontio, (governor general,) the renowned chief of Qui-bec. You know that he is the terror of the Iroquois, and that his name is sufficient to make them tremble, since he has desolated their lands, and carried fire among their settlements. There are beyond the sea ten thousand Onnontios like him, who are but warriors of that great chief, our Kin<;, of whom 1 speak. When he soys ' I go to 'war ' everybody obeys, aad these ten thousand chiefs raise bands of warriors both for the land and for the sea. Some embark in ships, like those you have seen at Quebec. Your canoe will hold but four or live men \u2014 twelve to the utmost. Our vessels carry four and five hundred, and even a thousand. Another portion go to war on land, but in such numbers that, when arranged in double ranks, they would reach to Mississaquenk, which is twenty leagues from here. When he attacks, he is more fearful than thunder. The earth trambles, and the air and the sea are on"], [15, "9 Doc. No. 69. bago, and thence down the Wisconsin into the Mississippi. In this ex pedition he was accompanied by Joylet, a courtier of France. They de scended the mighty current as far as Arkansas, and then turned back. They represented that they were hospitably entertained by the Illinois, who dwelt upon its banks, while by other tribes they were repulsed. This relation of the voyage of Marquette was not published until some time after his death, and by some it is regarded as fabulous; but Bancroft is disposed to adopt it as worthy of entire credence. Late in the season the voyageurs reached Chicago. Joylet hastened to Quebec to announce the results of their discoveries, while- Marquette re mained to plant the standard of the .cross among the Miamies. The manner of his death is thus narrated by Bancroft: \"In sailing from Chicago to Mackinac during the following spriDg, he entered a little river in Michigan. Erecting an altar, he said mass after the rites of the Catholic church; then, begging the men who conducted his canoe to leave him alone for half an hour, ' In the darkling wood, Amid the cool and silence, he knelt down, And offered to the Mightiest solemn thanks, And supplication.' At the end of half an hour they went to seek hij\u00bb, and he was no more. The good missionary, discoverer of a world, had fallen asleep on the margin of a stream that bears his name. Near the mouth, the voyageurs dug his grave in the sand.\"* This event happened May 18, 1675. Allouez died soon after in the midst of his labors among the Miamies. The Jesuits made a map of this region as early as 1669, which was published in 1672. We suspect that it is the work of Allouez and Mar quette, but it bears no name. Dablon thus speaks of it: \"It was got up by two Fathers, very intelligent and observing, who did not wish .to in corporate anything except what they had seen with their own eyes. That is the reason why they have only inserted the upper part of Lakes Huron\u00bband Illinois, although they have coasted much on both.\" When it is considered that these men were not engineers, and that to note the geographical features of the country formed no part of their re quirements, this map may, for that age, be regarded as a remarkable production, although points occasionally are laid down half a degree from their true position. The whole coast, sixteen hundred miles in ex tent, as well as the islands, were explored. Even Caribou, a low island in the midst of the lake, and not visible except within a few leagues, did not escape their observation. fire from the discharge of his cannon. He has been seen in the midst of his squa'lroni covered with the blood of his enemies ; so many of whom has he put to the sword, that he does not number their scalps, but merely the rivers of blood which he has caused to flow. He carries such a number of captives with him (hit he does not value them, but lets them go .where they please, to show that he does not fear them. Nobody dare make war on him. All nations be yond the sea have sued for peace with great submission. They come from every quarter of the globe to listen to him and admire him It is he who decides upon the affairs of the world. What shall I say of his riches? You think yourselves very rich when you have ten or twelve sacks of corn, and hatchets, and kettles, and other things of the kind. He haj more cities than you have men, which are scattered over a space of more than five hundred leagues. In each city there are shops containing hatchets enough to cut all your wood, kettles enough to cook al1 your caribou, ar:d sugar enough to fill all your wigwams. His house extends further than from here to the Saut, is higher than the tallest of your trees, and contains moie people than he largest of your settlements ever contained.\" \u2666History of the United States, volume I."], [16, "Doc. No. 69. 10 Alloiiez, Mtu-quette, and Jogues were remarkable men, and, had their lots been cast in a different sphere, they would have left a more Or. Table impress upon the age in which they lived. Their efforts to win the tribes of the Northwest to the standard of the cross, prosecuted with gr^at ;:eal, and under circumstances of privation and suffering, may be regarded as abortive. There is something impressive in the rites of the Catholic church \u2014 something in its mysteries calculated to overawe the wild mea of the woods. fc>o long as the missionary was in their midst and. superintended their labors, they yielded to his guidance and adopted his recommenda tions, so far at least as conduced to their comfort; but when he withdrew, with equal facility they glided into their former habits. The superstruc ture raised with so much care fell to* the ground the moment the sus taining hand was withdrawn. The effect of the contact of the two races has been to afford the Indian additional incentives to vice, while his in tellectual and moral elevation has been little advanced; aud at this clay, it cannot be- said that he stands higher in the scale of civilization than when first known by the white man. Such knowledge as we possess with regard to the early discoveries in the Northwest is derived from the \"Relations de ce que s'est passe de plus remarquable aux Missions des peres de la compagnie de Josus en la Nouvelle France.\" They are comprised in many volumes, to he found in the library of Harvard College. The occurrence of native copper naturally excited the wonder of the first voyageurs, and the references to it are numerous. The first mention is made in the Pielation for 1659-'60. An Indian, named Awatanick, who had passed from Green Bay to Lake Superior the year previously, reported \"'that its borders were enriched with lead mines, and cooper of such excellent quality that it is already reduced in pieces as large :_,-, the fist. There may also be seen rocks which contain large veins oi tur quoise,\" (green silicate of copper.) The relator adds that he has heard of the existence of gold on St. Joseph's island, and that the rivers of Lake Superior bring down grains of gold. Another relator states that diamonds occur on some of the islands at the foot of Green Bay. In the Relation for 1669-70, Father Dablon says: \"We baye learned from the savages some secrets which they did not wish at first toeo.mnu nicate, so that we were obliged to use some artifice. We do not, how ever, vouch for everything contained in the following account. After entering the lake, the first place met with containing copper is an island about forty or fifty leagues from the Saut, towards the north shore, oppo site a place called Missipicooatong, (Michipicoten.) The savages relate that it is a 'floating island, being sometimes near and at others afar off. A long time ago four savages landed there, having lost their way in a Yog, with which the island is frequently surrounded. It was previous to their acquaintance with the French, and they knew nothing of the use of ket tles and hatchets. In cooicing their meals, as is usual amou\"- the rava ges, by heating stones and casting them into a birch bark pail containing water, they found that they were almost all copper. After h'&W<* corv pleted their meal, they hastened to re-embark, for they were afraid of the lynxes and hares, which here grow to the size of dogs. They took with"], [17, "Doc. No. o\". TT them copper stones and plates, hut had hardly left flip shore before they heard a loud voice exclaiming in an arigTv* tojiej 'Who are the ihiev&s. that carry off the cradles and the toys of my children?' They 'were very much surprised at the sound, not knowing whence it came, One said it was the thunder; another that it was a certain goblin called Missi bizi, the spirit of the waters, like Neptune among ihe heathen; another that it came from the Memogovissioois, who are marine men, living con stantly under the water, like the Tritons and Syrens, having long hair, reaching to the waist; and one of the savages asserted that he had ac tually seen such a being. At any rate, this extraordinary' voice produced such fear that one of them died before landing; shortly after, two others died, and one alone reached home, who, after having related what bad happened, also died. Since that time, the savages have not dared to visit the island\", or even to steer in that direction.\" The Father attempts to explain this superstition by supposing that they were poisoned by using the copper boulders in cooking their meat, and that the supernatural voice was an echo of their own, and that the vanishing and reappearance of ihe island was due to fogs and haze which hang about it. He concludes by adding that it is a common belief among the savages that the island contains an abundance of copper, but that no one dare approach it. \"Pushing along to Le Grand Anse, (Neepigon bay,) we come to an island called 'Thunder island,' which is noted for its abundance of metal. (This is probably St. Ignace.) Further to the west is an island called Menong, (Isle Royale,) celebrated tor its copper. It is large, being twenty-five leagues long and seven leagu s distant from the main land. One bay at the nonheast extremity is particularly remarkable. It is bound ed by steep cliffs of clay, in which there may be seen several strata or beds of red copper separated from each other by layers of earth. hi the water is seen copper sand, which maybe gathered with spoons, although there are pieces as large as acorns. This large island is surrounded by several smaller ones, some of which are said to consist entirely of copper. One, especially, near the northeast corner, is within gunshot of the main island. Further off in that direction is one called Manitou-minis, on ac count of the abundance of copper. It is said by those who have visited it, that on a stone being thrown against it, a sound like that of brass when struck is heard. \"After having reached the extremity of the lake, there may be seen (one day's journey) on the south shore, by the water's edge, a mass of copper weighing 600 or 700 lbs., so hard that steel cannot cut it; but when heated it may be cut like lead.\" On one ot the islands near Ohaquamegon bay, he relates that copper rocks and plates are found, and that he bought of the savages a plate of pure copper two and a half feet square, weighing more than 100 lbs. He supposes that they have been derived from Menong, and that their trans port has been effected either by floating ice or by powerful winds from the northeast, which have rolled them along the boitom of the lake. He mentions the fact that the Ottawa squaws, .in digging holes in the sand to hide their corn, often find masses weighing 20 or 30 lbs. \"Near the river Nantonagon (Ontonagon) may he seen a bluff, from which stones of red copper fall down into the water. . Three years since we were presented with a piece from that locality weighing 100 lbs. We have cut some pieces from it, and sent them to Talon, at Quebec. The savages do"], [18, "Doc. No. 69. 12 not all agree as to the place whence it is derived. Some say that it is where the river begins; others, that it is close to the lake, in the clay; and others, at the forks, and alcng the eastern branch of the river. \"Further on is found the long spit, (Keweenaw Point,) which we have compared to the arrow of the bow. At its extremity is an island six feet square, which is said to be entirely of copper. Finally, to complete this survey of the Great Lake, we would add, that it is stated that mines of the said metal are found in several places to the south. All these cir cumstances, together with others which it is not necessary to mention, are deserving of an attentive examination. We would also mention an oxide of copper, which is said to come from the crevices of certain rocks, (Pic tured Rocks,) and the occurrence of certain pebbles along the shore, which are somewhat soft and of an agreeable green color. * If God pros pers our undertaking we shall speak about it next year with more knowl edge and certitude.\" Hennepin and L'Hontan passed through the lower lakes, but did not enter Lake Superior. Charlevoix, whose voyage was published at Paris in 1744, passed through the great chain, and his observations are well worthy of perusal. He mentions that pieces of copper occur on the islands of Lake Superior, and that he knew a brother of the order, a goldsmith by trade, who, while on a mission at Saut Ste. Marie, had made chandeliers, crosses, and censors of it. Shortly before the treaty of Paris, in 1763, by which the whole of this territory was ceded to the British Crown, Alexander Henry, an English man, visited Mackinac for the purposes of trade. At that time the Indians regarded the English as intruders, and entertained towards them hostile feelings. Henry was among the few who escaped the massacre at old Fort Mackinac, and owed the preservation of his life to the offices of a friendly Indian, who contrived to -convey him to the northern shore of Michigan, whence he made his way to Sant Ste. Marie. In 1771 he su perintended a mining enterprise in the vicinity of the forks of the Onton agon river, near the site of the copper rock. Their workings were prosecuted in the clay bluffs which line the banks of the stream, and the miners during the winter perforated the hill to the distance of forty feet. Having neglected to secure their work with sup ports, on the approach of spring the earth caved in and destroyed their drift. A boat-load of provisions was sent to the miners from the Saut, but, much to the surprise of Henry, when it returned on the 20th of June, he found the whole establishment of miners aboard. It is not surprising that explorations so ill-directed and visionary should prove abortive; and yet the miners represented that, in the progress of the work, they frequent-' ly met with considerable masses of native copper, and believed that they would ultimately have reached a large body of that metal. In the month of August, 1772, the mining force was transferred to a vein on the north shore. Little was done during the winter, but before the close of autumn the miners had penetrated thirty feet into the solid rock. The vein, which at the beginning was four feet in breadth, had, in the bottom of the shaft, contracted to four inches. Under these dis couragi''g circumstances, further mining operations were abandoned."], [19, "Doc. No. 69. 13 Henry concludes, from the results of his unsuccessful experiment in mining, that the copper can never be profitably mined, except for local consumption, and that the country must be cultivated and peopled before this can take place. He remarks, it was in the hopes of finding silver in sufficient abundance to make the speculation profitable, that the works were commenced. He speaks of the discovery of this metal in only one place, Pointe aux Iroquois, where, according to his authority, a Mr. Nor burg, a Russian gentleman, acquainted with metals, discovered a blue stone of eight pounds' weight, which was sent to England and found to contain sixty per cent, of silver. None of the early explorers seem to have noticed the existence of metal lic silver associated with the copper, although we know that, among the numerous masses of copper which have been picked up on the shores of tlie lake, some have contained a considerable quantityof silver interspersed through them. In 1S19, General Cass, under the authority of the Secretary of War, directed an exploring expedition, which passed along the southern shore of Lake Superior, and crossed over to the Mississippi. This expedition had among its principal objects that of investigating the northwestern copper mines, and was accompanied by Mr. H. R. Schoolcraft, in the capacity of mineralogist and geologist. His observations are recorded in his \"Narra tive Journal of Travels from Detroit northwest, &c,\" published in 1821. In the spring of 1823, Major Long, acting under the orders of the War De partment, and accompanied by several scientific gentlemen, started on an ex pedition, the object of which was to explore the river St. Peter's and the country situated on the northern boundary of the United States, between the Red river of Hudson's bay and Lake Superior. In returning, they coasted along the north shore of this lake. Professor Keating, in his nar ration of the expedition, remarks that they had seen native copper (boul ders) strewed in many directions over the great valley drained by the Mississippi and its tributaries. All the early explorers seem to agree in the opinion, that if deposites of copper should be discovered in this region, yet, so great is its distance from a market, and so wild and unsettled the character of the country > that there would be no hope of their being profitably worked \u2014 at least for many years to come. The attention of the government was called to the mineral resources of the Northwest during the presidency of the elder Adams, and a commis sion was instituted with the view of exploring this region; but we have been unable to ascertain why nothing further was done in this matter. Such was the state of things up to the time when Dr. Douglass Hough ton, State geologist of Michigan, in the prosecution of his labors, com menced the exploration of the northern peninsula, and by his official re ports awakened attention to this distant region. In his annual report, pre sented to the legislature of Michigan, February] , 1841, the great featufes of the country were sketched with a masterly hand, and the first definite in formation with regard to the occurrence of the deposites of native copper in the rocks was laid be'fore the world. After fliis preliminary reconnais sance of the country, Dr. Houghton entered into a contract with the United States government to execute the linear survey of the northern peninsula in connexion with a geological survey, according to the system devised by him in connexion wjth Wm. A. Bart, esq. Dr. Houghton"], [20, "Doc. No. 69. 14 had, in the prosecution of the State geological survey over the extensive territory of the southern peninsula/ found how great an amount of labor and how large a corps of geologists would be required , were the whole ground to be gone over by the geological parties, and had availed him self of all the information which could be obtained from the linear sur veyors who had directed the United States surveys in various sections of the State. He had engaged 'them to notice the rocks which they should cross with their lines, and, if practicable, to procure specimens of them, so that he might thus obtain a general idea of a region which he had neither time nor means to explore fully himself. In the course of these inquiries he received a great amount of valuable information, especially from Mr. Burt; and he was thus led gradually to the idea of adopting a system which should connect the two surveys, so that they might be executed under the authority of one person, and then a systematic ar rangement of a great number of observations be brought to perfection. The survey of the northern peninsula was arranged on this principle. The township lines were to be run by Mr. Burt, or under his super vision, while the subdivisions were to be made by other deputy sur veyors \u2014 Dr. Houghton having the especial control of the whole. Ail rocks crossed by lines were tQ be examined, specimens taken, and the exact locality noted, while at the same time as much information as could be obtained was to be collected in relation to the geological and topographi cal features of the country. The detailed arrangements with regard to the collection of specimens, and the plan of accompanying the sur veyors along the lines by a special barometrical observer, were admirable. This system had been fairly organized, and the field-work of one season nearly completed, when his melancholy death, by drowning, on the night of October 13, 1847, occurred. Most of the results of his extended personal observations were thus lost to the world, and the system was gradually abandoned, though for some time the linear surveyors were required to make geological observations ; yet, as they were not systematized by any person familiar with the science of geology, the results were never laid before the world in an available form, although much information of value was placed in the possession of the department. Dr. Houghton was a man of indomitable energy and perseverance, and fervently devoted to the cause of science. Had he lived to complete this great work, he would have erected an enduring monument to perpetuate his name. He died in the discharge of his duty, prematurely for the cause of science, prematurely for his own fame. The lands composing the Lake Superior district were acquired by the United States by virtue of the following treaties: 1st. With the Ottawas and Chippewas, concluded March 28, 1886\u2014 ratified May 27, 1836\u2014 by which were ceded the lands bounded on the north by Lake Superior, on the east by the St. Mary's river, on the south by Lake Michigan, and on the west by the Escanaba and Chocolate rivers. 2d. With the Monomonees, concluded September 3, 1836\u2014 ratified Feb ruary 15, 1837\u2014 by which was ceded a tract bounded on the east by the Escanaba river, on the south by Green Bay, on the west by the Monomo nee river, and on the north by an irregular line extending from the mouth of the Brule to the head-waters of the Escanaba. 3d. With the Chippewas of the Mississippi and4Lake Superior, con-"], [21, "Doc. No. 69. 15 eluded October 4, 1S42 \u2014 ratified March 23, 1843 \u2014 by which was ceded the remainder of the district washed by Lake Superior on the north, and extending west from Chocolate to Montreal river, and southerly to the boundary between Wisconsin and Michigan. In this cession Isle Royale was also included. i of these treaties, however, embraced other lands than those de scribe Shortly after this last cession, applications were made by individuals in ditT':: 'a.p. parts of the Union for permission to explore and locate any tracts supposed to contain valuable ores. These applications were granted by virtue of a joint resolution of Congress, passed as far back as 181S, in reference to the \" lead lands\" of Illinois. The applicant in the first in sio ce was allowed to select a tract of three miles square; but this, was subsequently modified, limiting him to one mile square. He was required to make the selection within one year, to mark the corners thereof, to leave a person in charge to point out the bounds, and to transmit to the proper department a description and plat of the same. On the receipt of this plat the applicaut was entitled to a lease for the term of three years, renewable for an additional term of three years, provided Congress did not otherwise direct; annexed to which were certain conditions: the most important were, that the lessee should work such mines with due dili gence and skill, and render to the United States six per cent, of al! the ores raised \u2014 to be delivered at such points within the district as the latter rnisln indicate. The Committee on Public Lands of the 29th Congress, 2d session, de cided that the Department of War had no authority to grant leases of cop per mines, and recommended that these tracts be surveyed and sold. On the 6th of May, 1846, in conformity with the decision of the Presi dent of the United States, the further issue of permits was suspended. The whole number of permits granted under the authority of the De partment of War amounted to about one thousand \u2014 nine hundred and sixty-one of which were located. Sixty leases for tracts of three miles square, and three hundred and seventeen for tracts of one mile square, were perfected, and mining companies organized under them.* At the subsequent session of Congress an act was passed, entitled \" An act to establish a new land district* and to provide for the sale of mineral lands in the State of Michigan,\" approved March 1, 1847. By the first section of this act, all of that portion of the public lands in the State of Michigan lying north of the boundaries of the Saginaw and Grand river land districts in the State, known as the northern peninsula, witfh the islands in Lakes Superior, Huron, and Michigan, and in Green bay, the Straits of Michillimackinac. and the river St. Mary's, within the jurisdiction of said State, was included in one land district, to be called the Lake Superior land district. The second section provides that the Secretary of the Treasury cause a geological examination and survey to be. made and reported to the Com missioner of the General Land Office; that the President be authorized to cause such of said lands as may contain copper, lead, or other valuable ores to be exposed to sale, first giving six months' notice of the times and yia\"?^ of such sale in such newspapers of general circulation in the several \u2022 fteport of D.

States as he may deem expedient, with a brief description of the lands to be offered\u2014 showing the number and locality of the mines known, the practicability of discovering others, the quality of the ores, the facilities for working the mines, and the means and expense of transporting their pro ducts to the principal markets of the United States; and that all of the lands in the said district not reported as mineral be regarded as agricul tural. The third section secures the rights of those persons in possession by occupancy under permits, or leases, from the Secretary of War. The other sections of the act in no way relate to the objects of the survey, and a re cital of their provisions is omitted. From the time of the issuing of the pennits the business of mining has been prosecuted with vigor, and in many instances with success. The day' is not distant when the product of these mines will supply the home demand, and add much to the national wealth. In a business like this, proverbially uncertain the world over, there have been many failures, many schemes of wild and extravagant speculation, and many plans of ill advised and ill-directed mining, which have resulted in the ruin of those engaged in them. Extravagant expectations were held out in the com mencement, which the mining experience of the world declared could never be realizes. * These, however, have passed away, and the business has settled down. into a regular, methodical pursuit, affording an admirable field to the mining engineer for the display of skill and judgment, and yielding to the adventurers a reasonable return for the capital invested. In the spring of 1847, pursuant to the provisions of the above-recited act, the Secretary of the Treasury appointed Dr. Charles T. Jackson to execute the required survey. After having spent two seasons in the prosecution of this work he resigned, and its completion was confided to Messrs. J. W. Foster and J. D. Whitney, the results of whose observa tions will be found embodied in the subjoined report. In the prosecution of this work they have been aided by Messrs. S. W. Hill and Edward Desor, as first assistants, by Mr. William Schlatter as draughtsman, and Mr. W. D. Whitney as botanist. The aid of Mr. Hill has been of the most essential service. His long residence in the district and his connexion with several public surveys in the Northwest, had given him opportunities of collecting a large fund of information, which has been cheerfully contributed to this work. His measurements and plans of the mines, his observations on the phenomena of yeins, his contributions to the boundaries of the rocks, as illustrated on the accompanyingmaps, and his thorough and laborious explorations during his connexion with the survey, are all gratefully acknowledged by the geologists in charge. The phenomena of tlie drift and alluvial deposites of this region have been ably investigated by Mr. Desor, and the results of his observations will be found embodied, by him, in that portion of the work which relates to the superficial and transported materials. His previous investigations of the drift in parallel latitudes in western Europe, and of glacial action as manifested in the Swiss Alps, and the formation of shoals along the coast of the Atlantic as observed by him during his connexion with the Coast Survey, had qualified him to enter upon this field with every prospect of success."], [23, "Doc. No. 69. 17 When it is considered that the agricultural capacity of a soil results not so much from the decomposition of the subjacent rocks as from the superficial deposites strewn over the surface, which have been derived in most,cases from sources far remote, it will be found that an undue prom inence has not been given to this subject. Besides, an investigation into the sources of these materials, and the agency by which their transport has been effected, forms one of the most interesting chapters in the phys ical history of the earth. The results of his observations on the fauna of this region will be com municated hereafter. The execution of the maps was confided to Mr. William Schlatter, and we do hot pay him an underserved compliment when we say that he has completed the work with consummate skill and ability. Much of this work has been executed in the midst of the forest, beneath the shelter of a tent. The investigations of Mr. W. D. Whitney were mainly directed to the flora of this region. His remarks on the nature of the forest trees, their geographical distribution and the economical uses to which they may be applied, will be incorporated in a subsequent report. Before concluding this introduction we desire to return our thanks to the several captains of mines for their hospitality and for the facilities afforded us in investigating the phenomena of veins. Without exception, we have found them intelligent and ready to communicate all of the in- formation in their possession. To the linear surveyors, particularly to Mr. John Burt, we desire to render our thanks for the communication of valuable information. To the late surveyor general, Hon. Lucius Lyon, of Detroit, we also desire, in a public manner, to express our thanks for his promptness in furnishing plats, and for other aid rendered in the prosecution of this work- We are fully aware that this report is, in many respects, defective; such as must necessarily result from the investigation of a wild and almost unbroken wilderness, with limited facilities at our disposal. We trust, however, that we have accomplished something in elucidating its true geological structure and its vast mineral resources. A"], [24, "Doc. No. 69. 18 CHAPTER I. PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. Boundaries of the Lake Superior land district.\u2014 Extent of the lake. \u2014 Islands. \u2014 Harbors. \u2014 Bays.\u2014 Coast. \u2014 Michigan. \u2014 Extent. \u2014 Bays, Islands. \u2014 Huron. \u2014 Rivers. \u2014 Mountains. \u2014 Table of heights. The region which forms the immediate subject of this report is bounded on the north by Lake Superior, on the east by the St. Mary's river, on the south by Lakes Huron and Michigan, and on the west by the Mon treal and Menomonee rivers, including the several islands belonging to the United States, and within the jurisdiction of Michigan. It isdmown as the Lake Superior land district , and contains an area of 16,237 square miles. It is included between latitude 45\u00b0 and 49\u00b0 north; and longitude 83\" 45' and 90\u00b0 33' west from Greenwich. Its coast, more than 800\" miles in extent, is washed by three of the great North American lakes. Lake Superior, the largest expanse of fresh water on the globe, contains 32,000 square miles. Its surface is elevated, according to Captain Bay field, of the English Admiralty survey, 627 feet above the ocean-level, while portions of its bed are several hundred feet below; thus forming one of the deepest depressions in the surface of the earth, excluding those portions covered by the oceanic waters. Its coast is 1,500 miles in extent; its maximum length, from Gros Cap to Fond-du-Lac, in a direct line, is 355 miles; its maximum breadth, from Grand island to Neepigon bay, 160 miles. The shape of the lake is very irregular, its widest expansion being near the centre, while its extremes are contracted. Its northern shore is rockyr affording many bold headlands, and many deep and spacious bays. Nu merous groups of islets gird the coast, which appear to be peaks, or aiguilles, connecting with the main rock far below. Of the larger class may be mentioned St. Ignace, at the outlet of Nee pigon bay, 1,300 feet in height; and Pie island, at the outlet of Thunder bay, which rises to the height of 850 feet. They are both composed, in the main, of rocks of igneous origin, and present bold and picturesque outlines. The southern coast is studded with fewer clusters. Towards the head of the lake there is a group known as the Apostle islands, composed of sandstone, and attaining an inconsiderable elevation. The channels be tween them afford good harbors, accessible from every poiat- La Pointe, situated on Madaline island, is already a place of sorae commerce. Grand island, about midway between the extremes of the lake, affords one of the finest and most beautiful harbors in the world. Its northern shore, where exposed to the surf, is lined with high cliffs of sandstone but the southern portion slopes gradually to the water's edge. Towards the eastern extremity are several low islands', composed of sandstone, which are of no great importance. In addition to these are two remarkable islands in the midst of the"], [25, "Doc. No. 69. 19 4ake, both of which are due to volcanic action. These are Isle Royale and Michipicoten; the former belonging to the United States, the latter to Great Britain. Isle Royale is situated in the northwestern part of the lake, being inter sected near the centre by the S9th degree of west longitude, and the 48th of north latitude. Its course is northeast and southwest; its length about forty-five miles; its width about eight miles; its area two hundred and thirty square miles. It is traversed by numerous parallel ridges, running with the course of the island, which nowhere attain an altitude of more than 600 feet above the lake-level. At the northeast extremity they are prolonged beyond the main land, and resemble the fingers attached to the human hand. These fingers afford safe and commodious harbors. The numerous long and narrow inlets which indent the coast result from its geological struc ture. Alternating bands of soft amygdaloid and hard crystalline green stone, which oppose unequal resistance to the action of the elements, have contributed to form the peculiar outline, of the coast. Powerful currents, at no remote epoch, swept over the island in a southwesterly direction, which ground down the softer beds and polished and grooved the harder, to their very summits. So thorough was this process, and so slightly have the harder materials, in the lapse of time, yielded to the ordinary action of the elements, that these grooves can be observed over surfaces of great extent, sharp and well-defined. No tree takes root upon these polished surfaces; the lichens even cannot find sustenance. The island everywhere presents a desolate appearance. Barren rocks; a dwarfed growth of cedars and birches, hung with drooping moss; abrupt cliffs, impassable marshes \u2014 these are the striking characteristics. The caribou, the lynx, and the rabbit are among the few animals that roam over its surface; the hawk, the owl, and the pigeon represent the feathered tribe. Where the igneous rocks prevail we find deep and spacious inlets, among which may be mentioned Washington harbor on the west, Todd's harbor and McCargoe's cove on the north, the deep recesses formed by Locke's point, Blake's point, and Scovill's point, on the east, and Rock harbor, Chippewa harbor, and Siskawit bay on the south. The southern point of the latter bay, which consists of sandstone, is approachable from the southeast, and also from the south, by a narrow and intricate channel. It abounds in hidden reefs, running parallel with the main land. The numerous ridges which traverse the island longitudinally are uni formly bare and precipitous on the northwest and sloping on the southeast. The intervals are occupied by small lakes, wet prairies, or cedar swamps. Michipicoten is situated in the northeastern portion of the lake. It is eighteen miles in length, and rises to the height of eight hundred feet above the water. It is a mass of greenstone, and one of tlie points selected by the Quebec Company for mining operations. In the midst of the lake is a remarkable islet, known as Stannard's rock, so called in honor of Captain Charles C. Stannard, by whom it was dis covered in 1844, while sailing the brig Astor. It has been erroneously described as an isolated peak or needle, shoot ing up from the bottom of the lake, and affording deep soundings on every side. Such, however, is not the case. It rises about four feet above the water-level, and exposes a surface of fifty feet in length and twenty in breadth. During a storm the waves sweep over it, but its posi-"], [26, "20 Doc. No. 69. tion is indicated by a long line of breakers. Professor Mather, who vis-* ited it in 1816, thus describes it in some MS. notes communicated to us; \"A dangerous shoal extends a mile or more to the NNE. of the rock, and another, as indicated by the ripple, to the NNW. In approaching it, we passed over numerous ridges and deep troughs between \u2014 the rocky bot tom plainly in view from ten to fifteen and twenty feet below the surface. To the south and southwest of the rock the water is deep, even at its base. It is a sandstone of a dark red color, and somewhat metamor phosed by heat, and disposed in nearly horizontal layers. Its bearings, from the most reliable information, are, from Manitou island, at the head of Keweenaw Point, SE. \\ E. 27 miles; from Point Abbaye, E. by N. | N. I lies in the direct\" route between Grand Island and Keweenaw Point, so that it is necessary for the navigator to make a detour to avoid it. This is the only reef known to exist in the midst of Lake Superior, and it is a matter of surprise that it remained so long undiscovered. Professor Mather states that at the time of his visit a strong current was setting eastward, which drifted the vessel more than half a mile from her course. The lake was calm and the breeze light; the approach to the rock, therefore, is dangerous even under the most favorable circumstances. The northern shore is much more deeply indented than the southern. Among the deepest of these indentations may be mentioned Neepigon, Black and Thunder bays, which, for the most part, are lined with eleva ted ridges extending down to the water's edge. No place in the north west presents a view of greater magnificence than is afforded in the vicin ity of Fort William. Blackened walls of slate and trap, covered with a dwarfish growth of cedar and birch, are seen on every side. To the south Pie island rises out of the lake, like an immense castle, to the height of 850 feet: to the west, McKay's mountain, a thousand feet in \u25a0height, overhangs the valley of the Kaministiquia, its flanks composed of basaltic columns as regular as those of Staffa: to the east, Thunder cape, 1,350 feet in height, with unbroken cliffs extending for seven miles, re sembling a vast colonnade, juts into the lake, beyond which the eye rests upon a dark expanse of water bounded only by the horizon, while to the north serried ranges of mountains rise one above the other until their out lines are dimly traced against the sky. The general trend of the southern coast is east and west, to which, however, Keweenaw Point forms a remarkable exception. Starting from its base, it projects for fifty miles into the lake, taking a northeasterly di rection; then curving inwardly, it pursues for twenty miles an easterly course, terminating in an abrupt headland which rises to the height of 800 feet above the lake. This configuration is due to a range of trappean hills, which in their widest expansion do not exceed twelve miles, or attain an elevation greater than 900 feet above the lake. The southern coast is less rock-bound and irregular than the northern. The principal indentations are Chaquamegon bay, Keeweenaw and Huron bays. This difference in the character of the two coasts results from the diversity in their geological structure.. Where the rocks consist of different degrees of hardness the coast pre sents numerous inlets, bays, and harbors, with deep but narrow channels but where the rocks are of nearly uniform consistency, the shores are gently curved, the bays wide, and the harbors sparse. Thus it will be seen, by inspecting the geological map, that where the igueous rocks pre-"], [27, ""], [28, "Pints!. MONTREAL RIVERS US"], [29, "Doc. No 69. 21 vail, the coast is finely indented; where the sandstones prevail, the coast is gently curved. Copper harbor, Agate harbor, and Eagle harbor are ex cavated in a belt of amygdaloid, included between two belts of conglom erate, which offer greater resistance to the 'action of the sea and the atmosphere. A stream or a fissure may have served originally as an inlet to the waters, whose excavatory power was circumscribed by the hardier and firmer sedimentary rocks. Between Eagle harbor and the Montreal river the coast, composed of sandstone, presents no projecting headlands, no sheltered bays. To the east of Keeweenaw bay there are several bold projections which result from the joining of rocks of unequal resisting power. The heads of the promontories generally consist of granite or basalt, connected with the main land by low and narrow spits of sandstone. Granite Point and PresquTsle are examples of this kind. Within the present century the connecting link may be severed, and the promontories become insulated like the Huron islands, which at no remote epoch were undoubtedly con nected in a similar manner with the main land. Lake Superior occupies an immense depression, which has been for the most part excavated out of the soft and yielding sandstone. Its configu ration on the east and north has been determined by the irregular belt of granite before noticed, which forms a rim effectually resisting the further encroachments of its watcs. Limited patches of sandstone, such as Caribou, Parisieu, and Maple islands, have escaped the process of de molition, and indicate the ancient limits of the detrital rocks. The configuration of that portion of the lake lying west of longitude 8S\u00b0 appears to have been caused by two axes of elevation extending in parallel lines from the northeast to the southwest, which upraised the sandstone, causing it to form a synclinal valley. Another valley of a like character occurs south os' the trap range of Keweenaw Point and the On tonagon region, in which the water has excavated a deep and spacious bay; but its encroachments are limited in that direction by the granite bosses of the Huron mountains. Let any one who doubts that the con figuration of the lake results from geological causes consult the map of this region, and he will be satisfied that all the projections and indenta tions of the coast conform in a remarkable degree to the main lines of upheaval. The southern coast of this district is washed by the waters of Lakes Huron and Michigan. The superficial area of the latter is nearly a third less than that of Superior, being twenty-two thousand square miles, while in depth it is not much inferior. It is elevated five hundred and seventy-eight feet above tide-water, and depressed forty nine feet below Lake Superior. The rocks which compose its rim are of a sedimentary nature, and afford few indentations suitable for harbors. The immediate shores are low, and lined in places with immense sand-banks. The water shoals gradually in approaching the coast. Green Bay in other countries would be regarded as a lake of great magnitude \u2014 its length being one hundred miles, its average breadth twenty. Great and Little Traverse bays occur in the eastern coast, and Great and Little bays d 'Enoch in the northern. The maximum length of the lake is three hundred and twenty miles, its maximum width one hundred, and its circumference somewhat less than one thousand miles. Its form is oblong, with much uniformity in its outlines. The islands are sparsely distributed, and"], [30, "22 Doe No 69. attain an inconsiderable height. Two clusters occur \u2014 one at the outlet of the main lake, the other at that of Green Bay. Lake Michigan is connected with Lake Huron by the Straits of Macki nac, forty miles in length, and four in breadth. At the narrowest point within this strait there are two. considerable islands \u2014 Bois Blanc and Mackinac. The former is a low, wooded island, twenty-five miles in cir cumference. Mackinac is only about three miles in diameter, and rises to the height of three hundred and fifteen feet; it is walled on every side by bare cliffs of limestone, which afford many scenes of picturesque beauty. As a military post, it may be considered as the Gibraltar of the lakes. For merly it was one of the principal depots of the American Fur Company; but of late years the traffic has rapidly declined. The commanding posi tion of MacKinac did not escape the keen eye of the Jesuits. Dablon speaks of it, in 1670, as the centre of three great lakes; and from that day to the present it has been an important point \u2014 a sort of council ground \u2014 in the negotiations between the two races. The harbor is excellent. There is nothing to make this island a place of any great commercial im portance; but had the government relinquished the fee of the lands, it would have presented a far different appearance from what we now be hold. Michimackinac signifies big turtle, so called from a fancied re semblance in the contours of the island to the form of that animal. Lake Huron is little inferior in dimensions to Michigan, its greatest length being two hundred and sixty miles; its greatest breadth one hundred and sixty. Its circumference is eleven hundred miles; its area twenty thousand four hundred. Its shape is that of an inverted cone. Georgian bay, one hundred and seventy miles in length and seventy in breadth, forms the northeastern portion, and lies exclusively within the British jurisdiction. Saginaw, a deep and wide-mouthed bay on the western coast, is the principal indentation. The rim of the lake is composed for the most part of de trital rocks, which are rarely exposed. In the northern portion of the lake, however, the trap rocks on the Canada side intersect the coast. The waters possess great transparency, and extend to a depth not sur passed by those of Superior and Michigan. They rarely attain a tem perature higher than 50\u00b0, and are stocked with fish of the finest flavor. The surface exhibits the dark-blue, or blue-black, so characteristic of the ocean. The northern coast, in the vicinity of the outlet of the St. Mary's, abounds in numerous clusters of islands, which form the most attractive feature in the landscape. Captain Bayfield is said to have landed on ten thousand, in the prosecution of his survey, and to have estimated the whole number at thirty thousand. The following table, with some alterations, exhibiting the area, eleva tion above the sea, and depth of the five great lakes, is taken from the report of S. W. Higgins on the topography of Michigan;"], [31, "Doc. No. 69 23 The entire area drained by these lakes is estii\u00c6ated, on the same au thority, at 335,515 square miles. This district is a part of that immense plain bounded by the Appala chian chain on the east, and the Rocky mountains on the west, and ex tending north and south from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic sea. Its mean elevation above the sea is less than a thousand feet, and its culmi nating points nowhere exceed 2,500 feet. They can hardly be dignified with the name of mountain chains, but may be regarded as the more ele vated portions of a gently rising and widely extended plateau. The beds of the great lakes are depressions, reaching far below the ocean level. In this plain, with their branches interlocking, the two great rivers of North America have their origin \u2014 the Mississippi and St. Lawrence; the one discharging its waters, through many mouths, into the Gulf of Mexi co; the other expanding into a gulf many hundreds of miles in extent be fore it becomes merged in the ocean. These rivers are as diverse in character as in direction. The Mississippi is the longer, but the St. Lawrence discharges the greater volume of water. The one abounds in difficult rapids, the other in stu pendous cataracts\u2014 the one is subject to great fluctuations, the other preserves an almost unvarying level. The waters of the one are turbid; those of the other possess an almost crystal purity. The one affords few lake-like expansions; the other swells into vast inland seas. Both have become the great highways of commerce, enriching the regions through which they flow, and supplying the inhabitants with the varied products of distant climes. Lake Superior is fed by more than SO streams, none of which attain any considerable magnitude, and are adapted only to canoe navigation. Those which flow down the northern slope of the basin are longer than those of the southern, and the water, being more exposed to the direct rays of the sun, possesses a higher temperature. They all have rapid descents, and, flowing over rocks which oppose great resistance to the action of water, abound in falls and rapids. The carrying-places around these obstructions are known as \"portages.\" Communication throughout the northwest between distant points is effected almost entirely with the canoe. It serves the same purpose as the ship on the ocean, or the camel on the desert. This kind of inland navigation has created a class of men of marked peculiarities, known as voyageurs.

Its their frail barks they pass from Lake Superior to the Mississippi, to Hud son's bay, to the Pacific, and even to the Arctic ocean. Rivers. \u2014 Rivers are the great arterial features of our globe; they define the valleys, give\u00abboundaries to the hills and mountain ranges, and if traced to their source, enable us, with the aid of a few well determined culminating points of contiguous ranges, to trace upon our charts the general feature of the country through which they flow.* This know ledge is particularly desirable at this day, when rapid communication is sought between distant points by means of railways. By barometrical observations extended over most of the district the elevation of the water shed line has been determined. These will aid in the selection of the most practicable route between the two lakes, and enable the observer to form a pretty correct idea of the physical features of the region. The following diagram shows the course of the water-shed in this dis trict. It is represented by the irregular dotted lines: It will be seen that the streams flowing into Lake Michigan, in the eastern portion of the district, head near Lake Superior. Proceeding west, the line is deflected from the upper lake, and another line diverges towards the northeast. The main line is due to the upheaval of the granite; the secondary line to that of the trap. We will describe the rivers of this region in their order of succession. rather than with reference to their magnitude. The Montreal is a river of no great magnitude, being navigable above the falls at its mouth by canoes only during the time of flood. It is formed by the union of the Pine and Balsam rivers, thirty-four miles above its mouth, following its meanders. At this point, according to Captain Cram, it is eight hundred and four feet above Lake Superior. Flowing over hard unyielding rocks, it abounds in numerous rapids and cataracts. Near its mouth it is precipitated eighty feet over a sandstone ledge. Four miles up, there is another fall of about the same height, but mucJi more pictur esque. The aboriginal name of this stream is Ka wasiji wang-sepi, or White Falls river. The Black and Presqu'isle are streams of considerable magnitude, which have their sources in the granite near the southern limits of the * Ca;jtain F. AV. Beechey, R. N. \u2014 Manual of Scientific Inquiry, art. \"Hydroo-raphv.51"], [33, "25 Doc. No. 69. district. They flow northwesterly, and, breaking through the trap range, discharge themselves into Lake Superior. The Ontonagon \u2014 or Nantonagan, according to the orthography of the Jesuit map \u2014 is the largest of all of the streams within this district which flow into Lake Superior. It has three principal affluents which com bined, drain an area of not less than thirteen hundred square miles. Their sources are found near the southern limits of the district, inter locking with those of the Chippewa and Menomonee. One of the afflu ents of the west branch drains a large inland lake, known asAgogebic or Little Fish lake, which lies about seven hundred feet above the main lake. The waters are clear, cold, and deep, and swarm with fish of the finest flavor. After leaving this lake, the course of the stream is northeast along the junction of the sandstone and trap, until it unites with the main river, aud has, in plices, excavated a channel in the sandstone to the depth of one hundred feet. After this junction the combined stream turns abruptly to the north, flowing across the trap range in a natural depression, through which it finds its way to the lake. The southern and eastern branches, for a greater portion of their courses, flow through a country deeply covered with stratified clays, and their channels are excavated in the yielding beds. The banks in places rise to the height of one hun dred and fifty feet, and are so precipitous that it is a task of great labor to clamber to their tops. The depth of water in each of these branches is sufficient to float a canoe, but numerous portages occur in consequence of the great accumulation of drift-wood. Some of these \"rafts\" are fifteen rods in extent. At the mouth of the Ontonagon there is a sand-bar, on which there is ordinarily from five to six feet of water. During the spring-flood this bar is often washed away, but it is reformed by the northerly winds, which drive in a heavy sea. The extension of piers from this point for the dis tance of four hundred feet seaward, so as to confine the current within a naiTow compass, would remove this obstruction and render the entrance at all times accessible. The bar once passed, there is a spacious harbor two hundred and fifty feet in width and eight miles long, with a depth of water between twelve and fifteen feet. The mouth of the river has already become a place of much importance, and an improvement of this kind would be of great value to this portion of the mining region, although its construction would be a work of much labor and expense. The nearest points where vessels can take refuge in a storm are La Pointe and Eagle Harbor, each of which is about seventy-five miles removed. A keel-boat seventy-five feet in length, aud capable of carrying ten tons, plies between the mouth of the river and the Minnesota landing, distant fifteen miles. Three miles below this point occur the Grand rapids, which present a very serious obstruction to the navigation. These, however, have been so far improved by removing the boulders from the channel, that boats can ascend by poling or warping. Between Keweenaw Point and the Ontonagon there are several small streams, which have their origin in the trap range and flow northward into Lake Superior. Their descent is rapid, and they afford an abundant sup ply of hydraulic power. Two inconsiderable streams occur near the head of Keweenaw Point, Eagle and Montreal rivers. The former flows along a longitudinal valley for a distance of six miles, then breaks through the trap range at nearly right-angles with its former course, and is precipitated"], [34, "26 Doc. No. 69. into the lake. It is the only stream of any magnitude in the vicinity of the mines on the Point, and its waters have been already employed in the washing of the ores. The Little Montreal flows through a longitudinal valley between two ranges of trap, and enters the lake a little below the eastern extremity of the point. The Sturgeon, with the exception of the Ontonagon, is the largest river on the northern slope of the axis between Lakes Superior and Michigan, and its sources are elevated more than a thousand feet above its outlet. The area drained by its tributaries is five hundred and seventy- five square miles. For the first twenty miles its course lies through the granite and metamorphic rocks, and the descent is rapid; after that it enters a broad and slightly undulating plain deeply covered with transported materials, and discharges itself into Portage lake. Its entire length, including its sinuosities, is not less than sixty-five miles. For the last fifteen miles of its course, it runs parallel with Keweenaw bay. Between its mouth and township 51, range 34, its course is very tortuous. Its banks are composed of clay, with pebbles intermixed, and rise from six to eight feet above its surface. Its width at this point is about one hundred and forty feet, its depth about four feet, and a luxuriant growth of forest trees, consisting of elm, maple, linden, and black ash, lines its banks. After crossing the correction line the country changes in its character. The ravines are numerous and deep, and the ridges of sand and clay at tain a higher altitude. A change is also observable in the forest trees, the cedar, fir, and white birch supplanting the elm, the maple, and the ash. One of our party, Mr. Hill, ascended this river in a canoe for a distance of twenty-five miles. His progress was occasionally obstructed by drift wood, around which he was compelled to make portages. The lower portion of this valley may be regarded as among the best agricultural tracts in the northern peninsula. The Sturgeon has, in the course of ages, formed a delta' at its mouth about four miles in extent. It con tains many lagoons, which at one time formed the bed of the river. This bottom annually yields a luxuriant crop of blue-grass, which is mowed and conveyed to L'Anse.* Portage lake, which may be regarded as an expansion of Sturgeon river, lies in the form of a rhomb at the base of Keweenaw Point. It is about eighteen miles in circumference, and has three principal arms \u2014 one con necting with Keweenaw bay, another with Torch lake, while the third extends to within a mile of Lake Superior, on the northwest side of the Point, across which there has been a portage from time immemorial. \u25a0_\u25a0 * L'Anse properly signifies \"the bay, or creek,\" but throughout this region it is applied to designate the settlements at the head of Keweenaw bay. These consist of'a Catholic mission on the west side, and a Methodist mission on the east. There are about four hundred souls consisting of Indians, half-breeds, and whites ; the first largely predominating. Their pursuits cnsist in fishing and hunting; cultivating, howevet, patches of potatoes, for the growth of \u25a0which the soil is admirably adapted. At each mission there is a school. The government employs a blacksmith, a carpenter, and a farmer, whose duties are to aid and instruct the In dians in iheir respective arts. There are also three or four traders who furnish the Indians with goods, in exchange for fish and peltries At the head of the bay is a saw-mill owned by Mr Bosweli, which annually turns out twenty thousand feet of lumber, worth from ten to thir teen dollars per thousand at the mill. f Father RenS Mesnard was lost while crossing this portage, on the 20th of August 1661 It is strange that no headland, or lake, or bay, throughout this vast region, bears the honored came ot him who was the first while man to explore them."], [35, ""], [36, ". t \u25a0 mj\u201ejA*rry Plan II BIG BEKUENESEC FALLS, MENOM O N E E R IV FR"], [37, "Doc. No 69. 27 By pursuing this route between La Pointe and L'Anse, the distance is shortened about eighty miles. The river connecting Portage lake with Keweenaw bay is about four miles in length , being broad and deep. The water on the bar at the mouth, however, is but about four feet deep. Between Keweenaw bay and White-Fish point there are no large rivers. The principal streams are the Huron, Dead, (Du Mort,) Carp, Chocolate, La Prairie, and Two-Hearted. They have their sources near the lake, and descend rapidly, affording abundant water-power. They are not navigable for canoes even, except for short distances, but their mouths, for the most part, afford tolerable boat harbors. The Tequamenen is among the largest streams on the northern slope. Its length is sixty-five miles, and the area drained by it not less than six hundred square miles, and its course is nearly parallel with that of the lake coast. It can be ascended to the foot of the falls fifteen miles up, in coast ing boats, and still further in canoes by making portages around the ob structions. Passing to the southern slope of the axis, the Manistee is the princi pal river in the eastern portion of the district. It drains a flat, swampy coun try, about 1,300 square miles in extent. It has four principal afflu ents which come in from the northwest, some of whose branches head within five miles of the Lake Superior coast. Over this area are scattered numerous lakes which serve as reservoirs to collect and retain the super fluous water. The White-Fish, Escanaba, and Fort rivers flow into Little Bay d'Kuoch. Each drains an area varying between 400 and 500 square miles, and all may be ranked among the second class rivers of this region. Their banks are covered with pine forests, and large quantities of lumber are annually shipped to Chicago and other ports. The Menomonee, which forms in part the boundary between Michigan and Wisconsin, is the largest river within this district with the exception of the St. Mary's. Some of its sources lie within fifteen miles of Lake Superior \u2014 its outlet is two hundred miles distant. Its eastern branch, called the Machigamig, or river flowing from a big lake, rises in the Huron mountains, which are 1,249 feet above Green bay. After crossing the summit level in township 48 north, range 32 west, there are a series of natural meadows covered with grass, through which flows a small, clear stream, across which one may leap with ease. After pursuing this for about three miles, we come to where it discharges itself into a small lake called by the Indians, Sagiagdns. This is the head of canoe navi gation between Keweenaw bay and Green bay of Lake Michigan,* and lies 1,049 feet above that lake. There are two other lakes in close prox imity, connected together by tortuous streams. A sharp range of granite hills bounds them on the north, while to the south the country is level and marshy. Between the second and third lakes occurs Portage No. 1, three-fourths of a mile in extent, and on the right bank of the stream. i \"In the fall of 1848 we passed over this route to Green Bay. Our canoe was borne by twa voyageurs from L'Anse to this point, distant twenty-five miles, over elevations l,2Qll feet above the lake, through cedar swamps where for miles we had to hew our way, and wade through meadows knee-deep in water. It was a herculean feat of strength and endurance, accomplished in little more than two days; and Agindos, whose shoulders bore the bulk of the buiden, de serves to be particularly named As this route is practicable, but ntver travelled except by Indians, we will describe it with some minuteneas."], [38, "28 Doc. No. 69. The descent is twenty-four feet\u2014 the channel being filled with numerous boulders. Portage No. 2 is on the left bank of the stream, a short dis tance above the point where it discharges itself into the Machi-gummi, or Big lake, (section 25, township 48 north, range 31 west.) The Portage is three-fourths of a mile long\u2014 the descent twenty-nine feet. Machi-gummi lies 1,014 feet above Lake Superior. It occupies the en tire lengUi of township 4S, range 30, and in its southern prolongation extends into the adjoining township. On the north it is bordered by a range of hills rising in conical knobs to the height of two hundred feet: on the south, the country is less elevated. Its surface is dotted with numerous small islands rising up dome-shaped, with much regularity of outline. These summits are clothed with a dwarfish growth of cedar and fir, while their sides exhibit blackened masses of hornblende. This lake is seldom visited by the white man, but the Indians resort here to hunt and trap. Along its shores are valuable deposites of iron, aud its solitude may be disturbed within the present century by the sound of the forge-hammer and the puff of the steam-engine. At the outlet of this lake the stream becomes augmented to the width of sixty feet, with an average depth of two feet; and the descent is very rapid: the water is highly colored, and flows over a gravel bed. About a mile below the outlet occurs the third portage, on the left bank of the stream. It is a mile in length; the descent 35 feet. Tlie bed of the stream is filled with boulders of hornblende and granite. Portage No. 4 occurs in section 7, township 46, range 29, on the left bank. Length half a mile, descent 14 feet. Between these two portages the river is confined within narrow alluvial banks, but it occasionally enlarges into lake-like expansions which are fringed with tall grasses. These become the resort of innumerable water fowl, while the wooded banks are the chosen haunts of the beaver and otter. Pealed sticks of yellow birch, often seen floating in the stream, indicate the proximity of the former, while numerous \"slides\" in the plastic clay-banks show that we were in the neighborhood of the latter. This portion of the country, though elevated, contains few ridges. The rocks rarely emerge to the surface, but are concealed by heavy accumulations of sand, clay, and gravel, mingled together pele-mele. The stream descends rapidly, and its channel is filled with large blocks of hornblende and granite. Near the north part of township 46, ranges 29 and 30, a ridge rismg two hundred feet above the surrounding level is seen, ranging north of west. Towards the river it presents a nearly unbroken cliff one hundred and thirteen feet in height, which, on examination, proved to be nearly pure specular oxide of iron. Portage No. 5 is on the right bank of the river, in township 45, range 29; length two and a half miles. The river for a long distauce above presents a series of rapids, many of which are difficult and dangerous.* * We have indicated on the general map the position of th'e rapids; and in this report we have described their character with some minuteness. We have done this for the benefit of future navigators. When one arrives at the head ol' a rapid white with foam and dotted with pro jecting rocks, he is desirous of knowing beforehand whether the descent be practicable; fur once within the current, ihere is no power to retrace. We have often had occasion to admire the dexterity displayed by our Indian voyageurs in descending long and difficult rapids. It requires a quick eye instantly to detect the di epest part ot the channel, and to determine, by the break of the water, the position of hidden rocks \u2014 a"], [39, "Doc. No. 69. 29 The descent between the foot of Portage No. 4 and the head of Portage No. 5 is eighty-seven feet; the descent of Portage No. 5 is thirty-seven feet. Portage No. 6 is on the line of sections 29 and 30, township 44, range 29; length one-eighth of a mile. It is caused by an accumulation of flood-wood, so thickly matted that bushes and flowers have taken root, and flourish luxuriantly. Here the winter trail to Green Bay passes, and the mail courier has availed himself of this obstruction to cross the river. Within this township the Machigamig receives from the right its two principal tributaries, the Mitchikau or Fence river, and the Nebegomiwini or Night- watching river. The origin of these terms, as explained by our voyageurs, was this: At one time the deer were observed to be very numerous about the mouth of the former river, and the Indians, to secure them, built a fence from one stream to the other. They would follow rather than overleap this barrier, until they were entrapped by their con cealed foe. This method of capturing the deer is also practised on the Menomonee. The latter stream abounds in beaver and other game; and it is the prac tice of the Indians, in the clear moon-light nights, to watch on its banks for their appearance; hence the origin of the term. Portage No. 7 is about two miles below the mouth of the last-named river, (township 43, range 31.) It occurs on the right bank, and is only one-quarter of a mile in length. The river here falls perpendicularly nine feet. A high range of slate rocks, rising from the immediate banks one hundred and fifty feet, was observed. Portage No. S (township 48, range 31) is over a ridge of hornblende and feldspar rocks, through which the river has excavated a channel: length one-eighth of a mile, descent seventeen feet. Portage No. 9 is in the same township and range, about four miles be low the former, on the left bank of the river; it is one mile and three quarters long, the descent being forty-two and a half feet. The ridge, bearing nortn 72\u00b0 east, attains an elevation of one hundred and fifty feet, whose summit is composed of granite, but the flanks consist of horn blende and mica slate, folded over it like a mantle. The banks of the stream are lined with precipitous ledges, and, altogether, it forms one of the most beautiful and romantic gorges on the Machigamig. The country in this vicinity is traversed by numerous ridges, more or less broken, which nowhere attain a great elevation. The rocks emerge to the sur face at short intervals, and the immense accumulations of drift noticed above are wanting. Portage No. JO is in the north part of township 42, range 31, about a mile and a half below the latter, on the left bank of the stream: length one mile and an eighth. The current is rapid both above and below, the descent between the two being fifty-six feet. At the foot of the rapids are several small islands which divide the current. The last portage (No. 1 1 ) is about one-quarter of a mile above its junc tion with the Menomonee. It is on the right bank of the stream, and one eighth of a mile in length. The river here breaks through a ridge of vigorous hand to guide the frail canoe as it dashes on its tortuous course with the speed of a race-hoise.

No. 69. hornblende slate, over which it is precipitated twenty-four feet. It is the most romantic of all the cascades on the Machigamig. ' The length of this stream from Sagiagans, following its meanders, is about seventy miles , and its general course is south of west: the area drained by it is nearly eight hundred square miles. The Brule, or Wesacota, here joins it on the right, and, after the junction, the united streams take the name of the Menomonee. The Brule has its origin in a lake of the same name, through which passes the south line of the boundary of this district. It is one of a chain of beautiful lakes which extends almost uninterruptedly along the whole southern border. The current is rapid; but only two portages occur in its course, about ten miles above its mouth, near the junction of the Mequa cumecum, in township 41 , range 32. The stream is eighty or ninety feet in width, its bed rocky, and its banks studded with a thick growth of cedar, tamarack, and birch, whose overhanging branches often obstruct the passage of a canoe. The Indians have been accustomed to ascend this river from time immemorial, on their route from Green Bay to Vieux Desert, and numerous camping-grounds are to be found along its banks. Its ascent is at all times practicable in a light canoe. The Mequacume cum is its principal affluent, which rises near the sources of the Sturgeon It has as long a course, and drains as great an area, as the Brule itself. This river, too, is frequently ascended by the Indians in their passage to Lake Superior. The length of the Brule is about fifty miles. The area drained by the Brule and Mequacumecum contains about nine hundred square miles. The Menomonee may be characterized as a river of cataracts and rapids. Although it pours down a large volume of water, expanding in places to a width of 600 feet, so numerous are the obstructions, that it can never be adapted to other than canoe navigation. Within the distance of twelve miles from the junction of the before described streams two portages occur, but the rapids at these places are sometimes run by voyageurs who are acquainted with the channel. A short distance below Bad Water lake, two falls occur within the space of a little more than a mile, the descent in each case being about nine feet.* The portages are short, and both are on the left bank of the river, and over ridges of chlorite slate. Great Bekuenesec (Smoky) Falls are situated in township 39, range 30, and are the most picturesque of all the cascades on the Menomonee. The portage is one mile and a half in length; and \" within this distance,\" says Captain Cram, \"the descent is 134 feet. This amount is divided into several chutes, with intervening rapids. The general aspect of this series of falls is very picturesque. At every change in the point of view, new and varied beauties are perceived.\" At the lower falls the water is precipitated in a sheet of foam from the height of forty feet. The river above is compressed between narrow and rock-bound banks, but below it expands into a pool 8(10 feet in width. Within the same township are situated the Little Bekuenesec Falls, where the water, in the distance of 250 feet, falls thirty-five feet. The portage on the left bank is short but arduous. The descent of the river within this township exceeds fifteen feet per mile. \u2022The heights of the falls on the Menomonee are taken from the report of Captain Cram, of the United States topographical corps.\u2014 Vide Doc. 33, 26th C ingress, 2d session."], [41, "31 Doc. No. 69. Near the west line of township 39, range 29, commence the Sandy rapids, which continue for more than a mile and a half. The bed of the stream is rocky, but the banks are lined with high dunes of sand, which make this portage, which is on the left bank, the most arduous on the Menomonee. The amount of fall here is twenty-one feet. In the same township, and about two miles below, occur the Sturgeon falls. The descent here, in the distance of one thousand feet, is about thir teen feet. The river is contracted within a span of eighty feet, and rushes between perpendicular walls of rock. The portage is on the left bank, over a ridge eighty -five feet above the stream, at the foot of the rapids. Before the construction of the dams near the mouth, the sturgeon as cended the river to this point, beyond which they could not go. Here the Indians were wont to resort in great numbers to fish, and the remains of their camp-fires are to be seen along the banks at short intervals. Quiver falls are situated in the south part of township 38, range 28. The descent is nine feet. The portage, cue-fourth of a mile long, is on the right bank. The Pemenee (Elbow) falls are five miles below. The principal descent is about eight feet, but immediately above are several ong and difficult rapids. The portage on the right bank is a mile in extent. A short distance below is Chippewa island, (township 37, range 28.) Between this point and the junction of the Brule and Machi gamig the country is rugged and broken. Numerous sharp ridges of slate, and hornblende and feldspar rocks are seen aggregated to gether, without much system. At most of the portages bare masses of rock are exposed, sometimes precipitous, but oftener worn and polished. The soil is thin, and for the most part sterile. Fires have swept thtough the woods which once covered the surface, so effectually as to leave hardly a living tree. Blackened trunks rise up on every side as far as the eye can reach. Over this dreary waste the birch and aspen have sprung up, and seem to struggle to gain a precarious support. Below Chippewa island the soil is more genial. The valley is occu pied by sandstones and limestones, and we meet with no sharp ridges, no exposures of rock, over large areas; but the country stretches out into gently rolling plains, traversed by occasional ravines. The river contains many rapids, but no falls. The Menomonee is one hundred and twenty-two miles in length, or about two hundred including the Machigamig. The whole basin em braces an area of not less than twenty-eight hundred square miles. For the purposes of navigation it is comparatively worthless, but it af fords an indefinite amount of water-power. The lower portions of the valley are covered with extensive tracts of pine, which are beginning to be made available. In this connexion we may mention the St. Mary's river, connecting to gether the two lakes, Superior and Huron. It is about sixty miles in length, flowing first a few degrees north of east, then bending abruptly, and flowing a few degrees east of south. Throughout its whole course it occupies the line of junction between the igneous and detrital rocks, forcibly illustrating to what an extent the physical features of a country are influenced by its geological structure. About twenty miles from the outlet of Lake Superior, at Saut Ste. Ma rie, the river flows over a sandstone ledge for the distance of three-fourths"], [42, "32 Doc. No. 69. of a mile. The descent is between eighteen and a half and twenty-one feet, dependent on the stage of water in Lake Superior. Above the rapids the river shoals gradually from its banks, and the water is not sufficiently deep to float a vessel for several rods from the shore. The banks of the St. Mary's are low, rising in no place over twenty feet above the surface of the water. Efforts have been made, and will doubtless be renewed, to induce the government to construct a canal around these rapids, and thus connect the commerce of Lake Superior with that of the lower lakes. This connexion is much to be desired, and it is believed that the en hanced value communicated to the public domain would amply repay the expenses of the work. The mere construction of the locks is not all that is required. It will be necessary to extend a pier into the river, above the rapids, to protect the works and insure an entrance to the locks. This pier will be exposed to heavy currents, and at times to large accu mulations of ice, and ought to be constructed of the firmest materials, and strongly protected. There are two points on Lake Superior, easily acces sible, where materials of the most enduring character may be obtained for this work. Scovill's Point, at the eastern extremity of Isle Royale, affords a tough crystalline greenstone, traversed by divisional planes, v/hich would assist materially in the quarrying. Vessels could approach within a few feet of the rock, and be in a sheltered position while load ing. The Huron islands, composed of granite, afford, perhaps, a still better material. It can be quarried within two hundred feet of the water, and delivered on a vessel by means of an inclined plane or with a derrick. The islands afford a good harbor at all times. This rock is also traversed by divisional seams, which will essentially aid the quarryman in getting it out. This granite, it is believed, will become an article of shipment so soon as there is a free communication with the lower lakes. The mouths of many of the smaller streams flowing into Lake Superior are silted up with sand and gravel, through which the water filters. In other cases, where the waves break, for the most part, in one direction, the streams are deflected from their true course, and run parallel to the shore for a long distance, until the accumulated back-water breaks through the barrier and makes a passage to the lake."], [43, "Doc.

While rivers have been aptly compared to the veins and arteries in the human system, conveying life and energy to the extremities, mountains, with equal propriety', may be likened to the spinal column which supports that system, giving it form and comeliness. They condense the floating vapors and cause them to descend in grate ful showers. They are the repositories of most of the metals used in the arts. They determine the direction of streams\u2014 they prescribe the forms of continents. . The mountains of this region nowhere attain an alpine height. I hey occasionally occur isolated, but are oftener arranged in groups, or in paral lel ridges. . 1. Two granite belts occur in the Northwest\u2014 one forming the axis be tween the waters of Lake Superior and Hudson's bay; the other between Lake Superior on the north and Lake Michigan and the Mississippi river on the south. The outline of the Canada range is N. 60\u00b0 E., though subject to minor irregularities. It forms the rim of the Canada shore for more than two-thirds of its extent. The summits of this range are gen erally rounded, and rarely elevated 1 ,500 feet above the lake. On the southern shore, a belt of gTanite approaches the lake near Dead river, and thence stretches westward, sinking down into a somewhat broken plain southwest of Keweenaw bay. Its widest expansion is about thirty miles. This belt constitutes the Huron mountains, which in places attain an elevation of 1,200 feet above the lake. They do not range in continuous chains, but exist in groups, radiating from a common centre, presenting a series of knobs, rising one above another, until the summit-level is attained. Their outline is rounded or waving \u2014 their slope gradual. The scenery is tame and unin teresting. Hemmed in by these knobs, it is not unusual to find nu merous lakes and meadows covered with grass, forming an agreeable fea ture in the landscape. These meadows appear at one time to have been lakes, which have been filled with the detritus brought down from the surrounding hills, or drained in consequence of the water having worn down the barriers which existed at their outlets. Towards the western ex tremity of the district, the granite reappears in low ridges, and crosses the Montreal within twelve miles of its mouth. There are subordinate patches of granite in other portions of the district, attaining no great ele vation, which will be described in the detailed report. The metamorphic belt folded around the granite is traversed by numer ous detached ridges of hornblende and feldspar rocks, ranging in E. and W. direction, and rarely rising more than 200 feet above the surround ing country, and present a more rugged aspect than the granite. A quartz range starts from the lake shore at the mouth of Carp river, and extends westwardly beyond Teal lake. Its outlines are sharp and well-defined, its escarpments bold, with fragments of rock strewn along its base. The boundaries of this group are defined on the accompanying maps. 2. A trap range starts from the head of Keweenaw Point and runs west twenty miles; then, curving to the southwest, crosses Portage lake near its head, and the Ontonagon river twelve miles from its mouth, and is thence prolonged into Wisconsin. Its length is more than one hundred and fifty miles; its width, from one to twelve. Between Iron and Presqu'-"], [45, "Doc. No. 69. 35 Isle rivers a spur shoots off in the form of a crescent, constituting the Porcupine mountains. Another spur branches off from the main chain on the south, arid is prolonged nearly parallel with it for twenty miles. This belt is made up of parallel ranges, presenting step-like or scalar declivities on the side opposite the lake, while the other consists of gradual slopes. Mount Houghton, near the head of Keweenaw Point, rises up like a dome, to the height of eight hundred and eighty-four feet: the Bohe- mian mountain, near Lac la Belle, is little inferior in height. The valley of Eagle river, on the northwest, is bounded by abrupt, overhanging cliffs, some of which rise to the height of five hundred feet above tlie surrounding countiy. In the vicinity of the forks of the Ontonagon the cliffs are equally bold , and from their summits the eye has an almost unlimited range. To the west, the trap range is distinctly marked for many miles, and the west branch of that stream flows along its base. The highest and most im- posing cliffs are north and east of Agogebic lake. Farther west, the ranges are less precipitous and more irregular, much of the countiy traversed by these rocks consisting of rolling table-lands. The highest elevation attained by the Porcupine mountains is one thousand three hundred and eighty feet. A remarkable gorge occurs in township 51 j ranges 42 and 43. This gorge lies about two miles south of the lake, and in that distance the ground rises about a thousand feet. Suddenly the traveller finds himself on the brink of a precipice five hun- dred feet deep, at the base of which lies a small lake, so sheltered and hemmed in by the surrounding mountains that the winds rarely ruffle its surface. Gloomy evergreens skirt its shores, whose long and pendent branches are so faithfully reflected on the surface that the eye can with difficulty determine where the water ends and the shore begins. From this lake flows the Carp river, and the beholder occasionally catches a glimpse of its waters as they wind through the narrow valley towards the great reservoir. To the west, and extending for five miles, he sees a per pendicular wall three hundred feet in height \u2014 occasionally broken through by a transverse gorge \u2014 at the base of which are numerous fragments, which have tumbled from the cliffs above. Still further down is to be seen the rich foliage of the maple intermingled with the dark green of the fir and cedar, and still beyond succeeds a level plain, stretching out for twenty miles, and clothed with a dense growth of trees; while in the dis tance the Black river hills are seen, blue and indistinct, resting like a cloud upon the horizon. That portion of the district occupied by the detrital rocks rarely rises three hundred feet above the lake. It is not unusual to see ridges of sand and clay forming considerable elevations. The Grand Sable is a re markable accumulation of this character, rising to the height of three hundred and forty-five feet.

The sections are numbered from one to thirty- six, inclusive, beginning at the northeast corner of the township and counting the first tier of sections from right to left, the second from left to right, and so on, aliernately. The townships are numbered north from a base line which starts from Lake St. Clair and runs thence due west to Lake Michigan. 'I he ranges are numbered west from a meridional line which passes through t-aul Ste. Marie. This system, which is an admirable tine, was first suggested by Htitohens, who, before the Revolution, belonged to the royal engineers, and subsequently became geographer to the United States. It wap early adopted by Congress, and, had it been extended into all the States, would have saved much vexatious litigation as to boundaries, and afforded a vast amount of geographical information, at an incpnsiderable expense. This system is executed with a chain and compass, winch, under all the circumstances, is the best which could be devised for this country, where the forests are so dense as to render it impossible to make use of those naiural monuments which are essential to connect triangulations.

These lines are by no means parallel, various causes eonspiring to produce divergencies \u2014 such as altitude above the sea, the geographical configuration of a country, the presence or absence of large bodies of water and of mountain chains, the purity of the sky, and the prevailing direction of the winds. Isothermal lines define the heat and cold of the earth. The line 59\u00b0 F. traverses the latitude of 43\u00b0 in western Europe, but descends to latitude 36\u00b0 in eastern America. The isothermal line of 41\u00b0 F. passes from lati tude 60\u00b0 in western Europe to latitude 48\u00b0 in eastern America. The presence of so vast a body of water as is afforded by the Ameri can lakes modifies the range of the thermometer, lessening the intensity of the cold in the winter and of the heat in the summer. By the freezing ot the water, a great volume of heat is evolved, and the intense cold of the northern winds is somewhat mitigated in sweeping over the open lakes. In the summer, when the sun, often with unobscured lustre, shines for sixteen hours in twenty-four, the intensity of the heat is modified by the breezes which are cooled in their passage over the surface of the lakes, the water of which is always at a low temperature. To show the equalizing effects of the lakes on the climate, we need \"Asie Centrale \u2014 Tome III."], [50, "40 Doc.

No. 69. 45 From these tables we derive the following results : That the mean an nual temperature of Fort Brady is nearly two degrees lower than that of Fort Wilkins, although the latter post is nearly a degree farther north. This difference arises from the insular position of Keweenaw Point, which is surrounded on three sides by water. That, while the annual ratio of rain which falls at Fort Brady is 29.5 inches, at Fort Howard it exceeds 35 inches \u2014 an excess which cannot be accounted for by the difference in the mean temperature of the two places, but results from the prevailing direction of the winds; for while the N. and NW. winds prevail at the former post for more than one-third of the year, the S. ahd SW. prevail for a longer period at the latter.* That, while there are more rainy days at the former post \u2014 the ratio being as 118 to 86\u2014 the showers at the latter are more copious. The direction of the winds is undoubtedly determined, in some degree, by the configuration of the country, pursuing the courses of the lakes. The observations at Fort Wilkins and Mackinac do not extend through a sufficient number of years to enable us safely to institute comparisons. So far as relates to the annual amount of rain, they are defective. In the subjoined table we have given the mean temperature of the year, and of the winter and summer, in corresponding degrees of latitude in western and southern Europe; also, the latitudes of places where the several lines of temperature correspond with those of the stations before given. The first number in the column of temperature represents the mean annual temperature; that which stands in the place of a numerator, the mean temperature of the winter, while the denominator represents the mean temperature of the summer. The European observations are from Baron Humboldt's tables. From these observations it would appear that the lines of equal tem perature on the western coast of Europe, without reference to the elevation above the sea-level, are about 13\u00b0 farther north than in the vicinity of the lakes. The climate at Fort Brady, during the whole season, corresponds in a remarkable degree with that of St Petersburg; indeed, the difference of temperature is less than between Fort Brady and Fort Wilkins. While the hills in the region of Fort Brady support a dwarfish growth of tere binthines, (resinous trees,) those in the vicinity of Nantes, in a nearly corresponding latitude in Europe, are covered with the vine. *Humboldt has given the following as the proportional quantity of rain in different latitudes : 0.

The rapid growth of barley and oats adapts them to the short summers of the north; they are found as high as latitude 69\u00b0 30', in Lapland, along with the potato. Wheat, which is a precarious crop, and little cultivated above 58\u00b0 in western Europe, yields good returns in the temperate zone, when the mean heat, while the grain is on the ground, is 55\u00b0; but if no more than 46\u00b0, none of the cerealia come to maturity.* Indian corn is a precarious crop beyond latitude 45\u00b0. From the tables above given it will be seen that the temperature of this climate is favorable to the growth of the cerealia. Annual plants, remarks Sir John Hooker, which require heat during the summer to ripen their seeds, and which pass the winter in torpidity, in the state of grain, indifferent to the intensity of cold, abound most in those regions where the extremities are greatest; whilst the perennial plants, which can better dispense with the maturing of their seeds, and which are injured by the severities of winter, affect the temperate climates. Of these again, those kinds which have deciduous leaves accommodate them- selves best to unequal temperatures; whilst the individuals on which the foliage remains, or evergreens , give the preference to districts where the temperature is more constantly equal. Thus, while the shores of the lake are fringed with spruce, balsam, fir, and cedar, the interior of the district produces the maple, the yellow birch, and the ash. At Fort Brady, the annual ratio of fair days is 1 68; of cloudy days, 77; rainy days, 71; of snowy days, 47. The average amount of rain which falls at Fort Brady is 29.5 inches; at Fort Howard, 35.7 inches. These results exhibit a discrepancy which cannot be fully accounted for by the difference in the mean temperature of the two places. The prevailing direction of the winds at the two places may be the true cause. At Fort Brady northwest winds prevail, while at Fort Howard southerly winds predominate. Phenomena of the waters. \u2014 Lake Superior possesses all of the sublimity of the ocean. In gazing upon its surface, whether stretched out like a vast mirror, reflecting the varying tints of the sky, or ruffled by gently- curling waves, or lashed by the fury of the storm, the beholder is alike im- pressed with a feeling of the grand and the infinite. During a residence of several summers on its borders, our attention has been directed to the fluctuations in the level of its waters; and, while we have failed to de- tect any ebb and flow corresponding with the tidal action, we have, on the other hand, noticed certain extraordinary swells which appear to be independent of the action of the sun and moon. These risings attracted the attention of the earliest voyageurs, and they have not failed to record their observations with a minuteness worthy of commendation. In the Relation for 1670-'71, Dablon uses the following language: \"As to the tides, it is difficult to lay down any correct rule. At one time we have found the motion of the waters to be regular, and at others extremely fluctuating. We have noticed, however, that at full moon and new moon \u2022Murray's Encyclop\u00e6dia of Geography, vol. I."], [58, "48 Doc. No. 69. the tides change once a day for eight or ten days, while, during the re mainder of the time there is hardly any change perceptible. Three things are remarkable: 1st, that the currents set almost constantly in one direc tion, viz: towards the lake of the Illinois, (Michigan,) which does not pre vent their ordinary rise and fall; 2d, that they almost invariably set against the wind \u2014 sometimes with as much force as the tides at Quebec \u2014 and we have seen ice moving against the wind as fast as boats under full sail; 3d, that among these currents we have discovered the emission of a quantity of water which seems to spring up from the bottom ?\" He supposes that this results from an underground discharge from Lake Superior, and asks, if otherwise, what becomes of the waters of Lake Su perior, and whence come the waters cf Lakes Huron and Michigan ? In the Relation for the year 1671-'72, Father Andre thus speaks of the movements of the waters: \"1 had not partaken of the opinion of those who believe that the lake of the Hurons has an ebb and flow like the sea, be cause I had not noticed anything very regular during the time I passed on its borders; but I began to suspect that there might be tides in the bay of the Skunks (Green bay) after having crossed Wild Rice river, (Menom onee.) We had left our canoe afloat, the weather being calm. The following morning we were very much surprised to find it on dry ground. I was the more astonished, since I had noticed that the lake had been for a long time tranquil. From that day 1 resolved to investigate the causes. The first thing I determined was, that the contrary winds, although mod erate, did not prevent the flux and reflux. I noticed, besides, that in the river (Fox) which empties into the head of the bay the tide rises and sinks twice in somewhat more than twenty four hours. The ordinary rise is one foot; the highest tide I saw caused the river to rise three feet, but it was'accompanied by a violent northeaster. Unless the northwest winds be Very strong, they do not prevent the river from flowing down; so that the discharge is from the middle of the bay \u2014 the water rising at each end, according to the hours of the tide. \" We must not be surprised to find this flux and reflux stronger at the head of the bay than on Lake Huron or Illinois; for, supposing the tide to be only one inch in those lakes, it must of course be more marked in this bay, which is from fifteen to twenty leagues long and from five to six in width, and grows narrower and narrower, whereby the water, bein^ re duced to a small space at the head of the bay, must necessarily rise much more than in the lakes, where the space is the widest.\" The late Governor Clinton collected a mass of evidence relating to these sudden risings, which is embodied in a memoir communicated to the New York Literary and Philosophical Society;* but, as it is not generally acces sible, we will avail ourselves of the most important facts. L'Hontanf records the following incident: \"On the 29th of May, 1689, \u2022we came to a little deep sort of river, which disembogues at a place where the water of the lake (Michigan) swells three feet high in twelve hours and decreases as much in the same compass of time. Our tarrying there three or four days gave me an opportunity of making the remark.\" \u2022Vol. II, p. i. fVoyage to America, vol. II."], [59, "Doc. No. 69. 49 Charlevoix,* who traversed the lakes nearly a century ago, in reference to Lake Ontario, says: \"i observed that in this lake, and I am told that the same thing happens in all the rest, there is a sort of flux and reflux, almost instantaneous \u2014 the rocks near the banks being covered with water, and again uncovered, several times in the space of a quarter of an hour, even if the surface of the lake was very calm, with scarce a breath of wind. After reflecting some time on this appearance, I imagined it was owing to springs at the bottom of the lake, and to the shock of their currents with those of the rivers which fall into them from all sides, and thus pro duce those intermitting motions.\" Mackenzie, who wrote in 1 789 ,f remarks: \"A very curious phenomenon was observed at the Grand Portage, on Lake Superior, for which no obvious cause could be assigned. The water withdrew with great pre cipitation, leaving the ground dry, that had never before been visible \u2014 the fall being equal to four perpendicular feet \u2014 and rushing back with great velocity above the common mark. It continued thus rising and falling for several hours, gradually decreasing until it stopped at its usual height.\" The following incident is related as having happened to Colonel Brad street, who commanded an expedition against the western Indians in 1764: \" In returning by way of Lake Erie, when about to land the troops one evening, a sudden swell of the lake, without any visible cause, de stroyed several of his boats; but no lives were lost. This extraordinary event was looked upon as the precursor of a storm; and accordingly one soon occurred, which lasted several days.\" The following occurrence is related by Governor Clinton, in the memoir before referred to: \"On the 30th of May, 1823, a little after sunset, Lake Erie, on the British side, was observed to take a sudden and extraordinary rise, the weather being fine and clear, and the lake calm and smooth. It was principally observed at the mouths of Otter and Kettle creeks, which are twenty miles apart. At Otter creek, it came in without the least previ ous intimation, in a swell of nine feet perpendicular height, as was after wards ascertained, rushed violently up the channel, drove a schooner of 35 tons burden from her moorings, threw her upon high ground, and rolled over the ordinary beach into the woods, completely inundating all of the adjacent flats. This was followed by two others of equal height, which caused the creek to retrograde a mile and a half, and to overflow its banks, where water never before was seen, by seven or eight feet. The noise occasioned by its rushing with such rapidity was truly astonishing. It was witnessed by a number of persons. \"At Kettle creek, several persons were drawing a fish-net in the lake, when suddenly they saw the water coming upon them in the manner above described, and, letting go their net, they ran for their lives. The swell overtook them before they could reach the high bank, and swept them forward with great force, but, being expert swimmers, they escaped unhurt. The man who was in the skiff pulling in the sea-line was driven with it a considerable distance over the flat, aud grounded on a small eminence, where he remained until the water subsided. There were three successive swells, as at Otter creek, and the effects were the same, \u2022Journal Historique d'un Voyage de I'Amerique, LXII1. fVoyage to the Frozen and Pacific Oceans. 4"], [60, "Doc. No. 69. 50 with this difference: the water rose only seven feet. In both cases, the lake, after the swells had spent their force, gradually subsided, and in about twenty minutes was at its usual height and tranquillity. In 1820, Governor Cass instituted a series of observations at the headJof Green bay to determine the changes in the water-level. These observa tions extended from the 15th of July to the 30th of August; and the following are the results: \" That the changes in the elevation of the waters are entirely too variable to be traced to any regular, permanent cause; and that, consequently, there is no perceptible tide at Green bay, which is the result of observation. And such, it appears to me, is the result of calcu lation, when the laws that regulate solar and lunar attraction, and the limited sphere of their operation, are. taken into view.\"* Professor Mather, who observed the barometer at Copper Harbor during the prevalence of one of these fluctuations, has published the results of his observations in the journals before alluded to. He remarks: \"As a general thing, fluctuations in the barometer accompanied the fluctuations in the level of the water; but sometimes the water-level varied rapidly in the harbor, while no such variations occurred in the barometer at, the place of observation. The variations in the level of the water may be caused by varied barometric pressure of the air on the water, either at the place of observation or at some distant points. A local increased pressure of the atmosphere at, the place of observation would lower 'the water level where there is a wide expanse of water, or a diminished pressure under the same circumstances would cause the water to rise above its usual level.\" In the summer of 1834, an extraordinary retrocession of the waters took place at Saut Ste. Marie. The river here is nearly a mile in width, and the depth of water over the sandstone rapids is about two and a half feet. The phenomenon occurred about noon. The day was calm, but cloudy. The water retired suddenly, leaving the bed of the river bare, except for the distance of about twenty rods, where the channel is the deepest, and remained so for the space of an hour. Persons went out and caught fish in the pools formed in the depressions of the rocks. The return of the waters is represented to have been sudden, and presented an impo sing spectacle. They came down like an immense surge \u2014 roaring and foaming; and those who had incautiously wandered into the river-bed had barely time to escape being overwhelmed. Our informants were unable to state whether this occurrence was succeeded by a violent wind or storm; but they all concurred in representing the day as calm. A similar phenomenon occurred twice the same day, in the latter part of April, 1842. The lake was free from ice, and no wind was prevailing at the time. A few years previously \u2014 the precise period our informants could not designate \u2014 the current between the foot of the rapids and Fort Brady, which usually flows at the rate of two and a half knots an hour, was observed to set back, and the water rose two feet or more above *hg usual mark. Some of the soldiers at the fort, in order to satisfy themselves as to the backward flow, jumped into a boat and rowed into the stream, when they found that the boat floated towards the foot of the rapids. \"Remarks on the supposed tides and periodical rise and fall of the North American lakes by Major (now Brigadier General) Henry Whiting, Silliman's Journal, vol 20, p. 2.

No. 69. 51 i These facts are given on the authority of Messrs. Ashmun, Peck, and Bingham \u2014 old residents of Saut Ste. Marie. We have witnessed numerous instances of these ebbings and flowings, which will serve to corroborate the above facts. In the month <W August, 1845, while coasting in an open boat between Copper Harbor and Eagle river, we observed the water rise up, at a distance of a fourth of a mile to the northwest, to the height of twenty feet. It curled over like an immense surge, crested with foam, and swept towards the shore, diminish ing as it advanced. The voyageurs paused on their oars, having first headed the boat so as to cut the advancing wave. It passed without doing us any injury, and spent its force on the shore. It was succeeded by two or three swells of less magnitude, when the lake resumed its former tranquillity. The cause of this uplift was apparently local, and \u2022operated but for a few moments. It could not, like the'bore at the mouth the Amazon, have been produced by opposing currents. It was late in the afternoon when this phenomenon was observed. The lake was calm; but to the northwest the clouds indicated that different currents of air were moving in opposite directions. Mirage was beautifully displayed, and imaginary islands were seen along the horizon. While at Rock Harbor, Isle Royale, in the summer of 1817, we wit- nessed the ebbing and flowing of the water, recurring at intervals of fifteen or twenty minutes, during the entire afternoon. The variation was from twelve to twenty inches; and we took advantage of their recession to catch some of the small lake fish which were left in the pools. The day was calm and clear, but before the expiration of forty -eight hours a violent gale set in. On the 23d of July, 1848, we went from Copper Harbor to Eagle river, where we arrived in the evening. The day had been calm \u2014 so much so, that we were unable to avail ourselves of our sail. In the evening there sprang up an off-land breeze, but we observed a strong current setting in to the river from the lake. The water rose and fell rapidly. The next day a storm commenced and continued for four days. On the 29th of July, 1849, we were at Rock Harbor, Isle Royale. The wind was light, and a drizzling rain fell all day. The next day, how- ever, a heavy northwester set in \u2014 so heavy, indeed, that the propeller then lying in the harbor did not venture out. On the opposite side of the lake, at Copper Harbor, (July 29,) the water was observed to fluctu- ate at intervals, varying from ten to twenty minutes, and rising higher and higher at each return, until the wharf, placed above the range of the highest stage, as was supposed, was overflowed, as well as the road lead- ing to the warehouse. This continued throughout the day. At Eagle river, twenty-five miles distant, the same fluctuations were observed. The wind, which was not heavy, came from off shore, and was therefore opposite to the current from the lake. The next day, as at Rock Harbor, there was a heavy blow from the northwest, the tendency of which would be to accumulate the water on the south shore; but it did not rise as high as on the preceding day, when the wind came from an opposite quarter. These facts show conclusively that these swells, although they precede the winds, do not owe their origin to this source. This will appear more satisfactorily by consulting a map as to the rela tive position of the points above mentioned. Isle Royale is about 20 miles distant from the northern and western coast of Lake Superior. Cos-"], [62, "52 Doc. No. 69. per Harbor is about 50 miles distant from Rock Harbor, in a south south east direction. Thus, while these fluctuations were observed at the latter point, the storm had not struck the lake on the Canada side. Similar occurrences have been noted in other parts of the world. The fluctuations in the Lake of Geneva, which are there called seiches, un doubtedly belong to the same class of phenomena. The intelligent traveller, Von Tschudi,* thus speaks of a singular phe nomenon which has in later times often occurred at Callao, and which, in 1841, he had an opportunity of observing: \"About two o'clock in the morning, the sea flowed from the shore with greater force than in the strongest ebb; the ships farthest out were left dry, which is never the case in ebb tide. The alarm of the inhabitants was great, when the sea instantly rushed back with increased force. Nothing could withstand its fury. Meanwhile, there was no commotion of the earth, nor any marked change in the temperature.\" The great wave frequently observed off Cape Horn and the Cape of Good Hope by mariners may belong to the same class of phenomena. We have already given Charlevoix's theory to account for these fluc tuations. It may be ingenious, but is not even probable. Governor Clinton was disposed to regard them as the result of earthquake move ments. If so, a commation of the land would have been noticed. The facts adduced seem to connect these phenomena with a disturbed state of the atmosphere, since they are, for the most part, succeeded by violent gales. Humboldt remarks that the regularity of hourly variations of the magnetic needle and the atmospheric pressure is undisturbed on earth quake days within the tropics. Von Tschudi says, that in seventeen observations which he made during the earthquakes of Lima, with a good Lefevre barometer, he found, in fifteen instances, the position of the mer cury quite unaltered. On one occasion, shortly before a commotion, he observed it 2.4 lines lower than it had been twenty-four hours before. Another time he observed, also on the approach of the shock, a remarka ble rising and sinking. We may regard the earth as surrounded by two oceans \u2014 one aerial, the other aqueous. By the laws which regulate two fluids thus relatively situated, a local disturbance in the one would produce a corresponding disturbance in the other. Every rise or fall of \"one twentieth of an inch in the mercurial column would be attended with an elevation or depres sion of the surfacfe of the ocean equal to one inch.f Again, as has been remarked by De la Beche,t a sudden impulse given to the particles of water, either by suddenly increased or diminished pressure in the atmos phere, would cause a perpendicular rise or fall, in the manner of a wave, beyond the height or depth strictly due to the mere weight itself. This \u2022Travels in Peru. t Whewell on Tides. \\ De la Beche, (Survey of Cornwall,) quoting from the manuscripts of Mr. Walker who has devoted much time to the observation of tides, says: ': He has found that changes in the heights of the water's surface, resulting from changes in the pressure of the atmosphere \u00b0are often noticed on a.good tide-gauge before the barometer gives notice of the change. * \u00bb *' If ti<W g;aoges at important dock-yards show that a sudden change of sea-level has taken place indica' tive of suddenly decreased atmospheric weight, before the barometer has given notice of such a change, all that time which elapses between the notices given by the tide-o-au\u00b0-e and birome ter is so much gained; and those engaged with shipping know the valuers =even a few mo ments before the burst of an approaching hurricane.\""], [63, "Doc. No. 69. 53 sudden impulse would give rise to a series of aqueous waves, which would propagate themselves from the centre of disturbance, like the cir cles which are observed when a stone is cast into the water. These un dulations are perceived in the liquid before the gale sets in. It is not to be expected that the oscillations in the barometer, in all instances, will correspond with those of the water; for Mr. Redfield has shown that storms have sometimes been preceded by an unusual pressure of the at mosphere, the barometer standing remarkably high, and hsnce he has in ferred that there existed around the gale an accumulation of air, under a great degree of pressure, forming a margin. It may frequently happen, that while the effects are perceived at the place of observation, the cause may be far removed. Many persons who have resided on the borders of the lakes maintain that, aside from the annual variations in the height of their surfaces, there is a more extended one recurring at intervals varying from five to seven years, while others extend the period to fourteen. The greatest height of water heretofore observed is about six feet. The statistics which have been published* in reference to this rise indicate that the variations in the water-level in a series of years are considerable, but that they do not recur at regular intervals. The meteorological registers kept at various stations show that the annual amount of rain whrich falls over a given area is extremely variable. Thus, at Fort Brady, where the mean oT five years' observations is 29.58 inches, the extremes are 36.92 and 22.44. Again, the season in the basin of Lake Superior may be rainy, while that in the region of the tributaries of the lower lakes may be dry, and vice versa; and thus the lower lakes might be on the rise, while their tribu- taries failed to discharge their usual volume of water. In proof of this diversity of humidity, it may be mentioned, that during the year 1848, an unusual quantity of rain fell in the basin of Lake Superior, and all of its tributaries were swollen. The lake was gradually rising when we left in September, and at that time had attained a point higher than had been observed for three years previously. On reaching Lake Michigan, in October, we found that that lake began to be sensibly affected by the in- creased volume of water discharged through the St. Mary's river. On arriving at Cincinnati, the Ohio river was observed to be contracted to less than half its usual volume, so that only the smallest class of boats could navigate its waters. If meteorological observations were kept at different stations extending through the entire region drained by the great lakes, it would undoubt edly be found that the variations in the water level corresponded with the variable amount of rain over thai area.f A larger portion of the tributaries of Lake Superior have their origin in a region covered for two-thirds of the year with ice and snow. Lae in May the icy fetters are unloosed, and the lake commences rising, and con tinues to rise until the last of September, when it attains its maximum \u2022Vide the memoir of Governor Clinton before referred to; Michigan Geological E.eporis; Ohio Geological Reports, 1833. f The surface of Lake Superior, on the 12ih of August, 1849, wa% 23j inches higher thania May, 1847."], [64, "Doc. No. 69. 51 It then recedes gradually until the streams begin to discharge their spring Snow usually commences falling as early as the middle of October, arid the ground is covered before the frost has penetrated to a great depth. The amount of snow during the season has been represented as high as thirty feet; but, in consequence of its evaporation, and its change from a crystalline to a granular form, knojvn as neve.it settles, and the actual depth on the ground rarely exceeds four feet. . Trappers, in crossing the inland lakes in midwinter, often break through, so slight and unstable is the covering. The temperature of the water of Lake Superior during the summer, a fathom or two below the surface, is but a few degrees above the freezing point. The following observations show the temperature of the water at different times in different parts of the lake. In the western portion, the water is colder than in the eastern\u2014 the surface flow becoming warmer as it advances towards- the outlet. The water in these experiments was taken siom the surface. During the severe winters, the surface of the. lake becomes congealed. When a gale sets in, the ice is seen to undulate and break, and the water to gush through the fissures, until finally the whole mass is set in motion the fragments clashing against one another, accompanied by loud reports, like volleys of musketry. Long parallel ridges of ice, fifteen or twenty feet in height, are piled up along the shores. We can readily conceive how masses of rock thus entangled might be carried for considerable dis- tances when the ice becomes detached and floats off, and how a cliff might be scratched and grooved. The waters of the lake possess great, transparency, and a tin cup may be seen to the depth often fathoms. Coasting along the shores in a calm sunlight day, and looking over the gunwale of the boat, the voyageur stems to be suspended over the floor of the lake, and every fissure in the rock, and every glittering pebble is revealed with wonderful clearness. The light streaming through the transparent medium tinges every object with a brilliant hue. The evaporation from the surfaces of the lakes must be immense. The combined area of Lakes Superior, Huron, Michigan, and Erie is about 87,000 square miles, and of their basins not less than 335,515 square miles. Fah re n ieit. Water. Air.

It has been estimated that the quantity of water passing into the Niagara river at Black Rock is 22,440,000 cubic feet per minute, or about 80J cubic miles per annum.* This is equivalent to fifteen inches perpen dicular depth of water spread over the area of the whote country drained. The annual amount of rain which falls within this area is about thirty inches. One-half, therefore, of the water which falls within the basin of the upper St. Lawrence is takeh up by evaporation, amounting to 11,800,000,000,000 cubic feet.f At Saut Ste. Marie, Jbe outlet of Lake Superior, the spectator beholds a river nearly a mile in width, and of sufficient depth to float the largest vessel. In its onward progress , it winds among innumerable islands, and ultimately discharges itself, by several mouths, into Lake Huron. At FortGratiot, he sees the same river, under another name, after having re ceived all of the tributaries of Michigan and Huron, contracted to a width of little more than three hundred yards, but of increased depth, and he finds it difficult to realize that it is the same river which he saw three hun dred miles above. So, too, the voyageur who has coasted around Lake Superior and gauged the streams which pour their annual floods into the great reservoir, when he stands on the brink of Niagara, and witnesses the fearful plunge of the cataract, is induced to inquire what has become of the superfluous water. The difference between the temperature of the air and the lake gives fise to a variety of optical illusions, known as mirage. Mountains are seen with inverted cones; headlands project from the shore where none exist; islands, clothed with verdure or girt with cliffs, rise up from the bosom of the lake, remain a while, and disappear. In approaching Ke weenaw Point, Mount Houghton is the first object to greet the eye of the mariner. Its dome-shaped summit serves as a landmark to guide him in his course. Once or twice, in peculiar stages of the atmosphere, we have observed its summit inverted in the sky long before the mountain itself was visible. On the north shore, during the summer months, hardly a day passes without witnessing illusions of this kind. The Paps, two elevated moun tains near the entrance of Neepigon bay, would at one time appear like hour-glasses, and at another like craters, belching forth long columns of smoke, which gradually settled around their cones. Thunder cape assumed shapes equally grotesque: at one time resem bling a huge anvil with its handle projecting over the lake, at another it appeared as though traversed from summit to base by an immense fissure. These phenomena are more common on the lakes than on the Atlantic coast, since hardly a day passes during the summer without a more or less striking exhibition of this kind. The amount of refraction, dependent on the state of the atmosphere, is, during the greater pan of the summer, extraordinarily variable. The greatest difficulty is experienced in making astronomical observations, from this cause. Observations taken in the afternoon, and generally during the night, are almost invariably worthless. The varying refraction may often be noticed in meridian observations of \u2022VideM. Z. Allen's article in Silliman's Journal.

No. 69. the sun with the artificial horizon, when the two images will be seen to lap over and then separate from each other a great number of times during the few minutes, while the apparent motion of the sun is almost imper ceptible. These variations amountto several minutes, of altitude; and; of course, on such occasions, no use can be made of the observations. Ob servations taken in the morning, when a steady brisk breeze was blowing, and the sky free from clouds, were found to be the only ones on which any dependence could be placed. The same phenomena of rapidly- varying refraction may often be wit nessed at sunset, when the sun, sinking into the lake, undergoes a most striking and rapid variety of changes. At one moment, it is drawn out into a pear like shape; the next, it takes an elliptical form; and just as it disappears, the upper part of its disk becomes elongated into a ribbon of light, which seems to float for a moment upon the surface of the water and then disappear. The annexed cut represents the outline of the appearance of .the sun as it went down in the waters of Lake Michigan, June 19, 1849. The cause of these phenomena can readily be found in the ever varying movement of bodies of differently heated air charged with, different amounts of moisture. Those who navigate the 'lake not unfrequently notice l _ * _ r _ \" i_ i \u2022 _._' i_i \u25a0_ Fig. 2. that they pass instantaneously irom a current ot air blowing briskly in one direction into one blowing with equal force from an opposite direction. The lower sails of a vessel are sometimes entirely becalmed, while a brisk breeze fills the upper. Frosts, of sufficient severity to turn the leaves, usually occur as early as the middle of September. Snow commences falling by the middle of October, and for more than six months the ground is covered with a fleecy mantle. The streams become locked with ice and remain so until May. The ground does not become frozen to a, great depth, and, so soon as the snow disappears, vegetation shoots into life, and the air swarms with myriads of insects. During the long days the sun shines with undimin ished splendor, and the influence of its direct rays compensates for the low mean temperature. Spring and summer are mingled. The forest becomes clothed with leaves, and its solitude is enlivened by the song of birds and the hum of insects, before all traces of snow have dis\u00bb appeared. Notwithstanding the proximity of the lake, the thermometer has a range of 120\u00b0 in the course of the year. Often in midsummer, when, for several days, the winds come from the southwest, the voyageur ex periences a suffocating heat \u2014 an enervating depression. The perspiration rolls from him even when unemployed and protected from the glare of the sun by the forest's shade. But, fortunately, these suffocating heats are of short continuance. In the valley of the Ontonagon, on the 11th of June last, the thermom eter rose to 96\u00b0.* The wind was blowing from ihe SW., but brought * Humboldt remarks that the thermometer nowhere rises higher than 104\u00b0 F., unless exposed to the influence of bodies which radiate heat.

A little after midday, a dark cloud, emit ting from its edges a pale phosphorescent light, rose from the lake, and advanced against the wind. Its approach was indicated by a loud roaring, and, when it reached our encampment, the trees swayed to and fro, aud many were prostrated around us. The air was filled with flying leaves and branches. Voyageurs and men instinctively rushed into the river, and remained until the fury of the storm had abated. Thunder-storms of great, violence are not unusual; and the large tracts of prostrate timber frequently met with in the forests, and known as \" windfalls,\" indicate the path of the tornado. Sudden gusts of wind spring up on the lake, and hence the oldest voyageurs are most inclined to hug the shore. Instead of seeking for a solution of these phenomena by a resort to natural causes, they ascribe them, like the Scandinavians of old, to the freaks of a crazy old woman, who is endowed with ubiquity : \" Now here, now there, and everywhere.\" Before the middle of September, a change in the elements becomes ob servable. The light and sportive breezes are succeeded by heavy gales, which sweep over . the lake, and render coasting exceedingly hazardous. Auroras, even in midsummer, are of frequent occurrence, and exhibit a brilliancy and extent rarely observed in lower latitudes. The com monest phenomena are these: A dark cloud, ringed on the upper edge with a pale luminous haze, skirts the northern horizon. From this, streaks of orange and blue-colored light flash up, and often reach a point south of the zenith. They rapidly increase and decrease, giving to the whole hemisphere the appearance of luminous waves, and occa sionally forming perfect coronas. They commence shortly after sunset, and continue through the night. The voyageurs regard them as the precursors of storms and gales, and our own observations have con firmed the result. Occasionally broad belts of light are seen spanning the whole arc of the heavens, of sufficient brilliancy to enable one to read. In the winter these phenomena are much more frequent, and the ground appear* tingecAvith a crimson hue. The aurora indicates a dis turbance of the equilibrium in the distribution of terrestrial magnetism, Mid, according to Dove, may be regarded, not as an externally mani fested cause of this disturbance, but rather as a result of telluric activity \u2014 manifested on one side by the appearance of light, and on the other by the vibrations of the magnetic needle.* On one or two occasions we have witnessed the rare and beautiful phenomenon of parhelia, or mock suns. * For a full exposition of these phenomena, consult Humboldi's Kosnios, vol. 1."], [68, "58 Doc.

That portion of the Lake Superior land district whose geology we pur pose to delineate in the following report is represented on the accompany ing maps, entitled \u2014 1. A geological map of Keweenaw Point. . 2. A geological map of the region between Portage lake and the Mon treal river. 3. A geological map of Isle Royale. These maps comprise the territory known as the copper region. The iron region, though of less extent, but of equal economical value, will form the subject of a subsequent communication. The rocks which constitute the solid framework, so to speak, of this district, are divisible into two classes, widely different in their origin and composition \u2014 the igneous and aqwous. Under the first division may be included the several varieties of trap \u2014 using this term as a generic one \u2014 such as greenstone, granular and amygdaloidal trap, basalt, &c. These rocks appear to have been gener- ated within the bowels of the earth by the action of fire, and in some cases to have been protruded in vast irregular masses, forming conical or dome- shaped mountains; at other times, in continuous lines of elevation; while in others they appear to have flowed like lava-currents in sheets over the sands then in the progress of accumulation. The mineral substances which compose these ancient lavas are very various in their nature, but in gener- al it may be said that the predominating rock is on^ composed of an inti- mate mixture of labrador, hornblende, and chlorite, though the latter is not an invariable accompaniment. ' To the second class, or aqueous formation, may be referred the sand* stones, shales, and limestones of this district. They occur in stratified beds, divided into layers, strata, lamin\u00e6, <fcc. The materials appear to \u2022 have been transported by currents and deposited on the floor of the ocean, where they subsequently became consolidated. In addition to these, there is another class of rocks which have undoubt- edly resulted from the joint operation of igneous and aqueous causes. The materials appear originally to have been ejected through rents and fissures in the crust of the earth to the surface, where they were subse quently transported and ground up by currents and deposited in stratified beds. This class of rocks is termed by M. Prevost* plutoneptuuean; and * Article \" Formation,\" Dictionnaire Universel d'Histoire Malurelle."], [69, "Doc. No. 69. 59 to this division may be referred the conglomerates and chlorite beds asso ciated with the trap. The metamorphic rocks, or those which were supposed originally to have been deposited by water and subsequently modified by heat, causing them to resemble igneous products, are developed only to a limited extent in the copper region; but in the iron region they are displayed on a scale of vastness, and form the most interesting feature in the physical history of the district. The mineralogical character of the trappean rocks, being a complex and difficult subject, will be separately described in the chemical part of the report. At present it may, however, be briefly stated that they are in gen eral made up of an intimate mixture of labrador and hornblende, forming a dark-colored homogeneous mass, in which the separate minerals cannot be distinguished by the eye. Chlorite, though not an invariable accompani ment, is often present in a considerable quantity. Magnetic oxide of iron is also a very common ingredient, and sometimes in visible particles, though generally its presence is only betrayed by the action of the rock on the magnetic needle. The variable proportion and nature of the mineral ingredients give rise to a great diversity in the external characters of the mass, which diversity is still further increased by the different circum stances under which different portions of a rock identical in mineral character may have passed from the fluid to the salid state. The same rock may be found in every shape of transition, from the most compact and homogeneous structure to a light porous mass, filled with cavities, or amygdules, which have often, posterior to the cooling of the rock, been filled with various mineral substances. For the sake of convenience in describing the local details, and in order to adhere, as much as possible, to the terms already familiarly used by those engaged in mining explorations in this district, we shall include, under the name of trap range, or trappean rocks, all the different varie ties of igneous rocks which form the great belt extending from the ex tremity of Keweenaw Point to the Montreal river, and which also form the greater portion of Isle Royale. When the rock is vesicular in its structure, it is called amygdaloid; when compact, crystalline, or homo geneous, the hornblende predominating, it is called greenstone; when columnar or jointed, as on Isle Royale, it is called basalt. If the homo geneous base contain distinct crystals of feldspar disseminated, it becomes a true porphyry,' and the largely crystalline and feldspatic varieties are lyiown as sienitic. These and, many ether varieties occur abundantly throughout the dis trict, in belts imposed one upon another. Their position and the changes they have caused in the contiguous detrital rocks will be noticed in de scribing the detailed geology. Range and extent. \u2014 Commencing at the head of Keweenaw Point, we find the trappean rooks, with the associated conglomerates, emerging to the surface in bold stair-like cliffs, affording many scenes of wild and picturesque beauty. This peculiar physiognomy is characteristic of the whole trap region. Humboldt long ago remarked that each zone had its particular types of animal and vegetable life, but that the inorganic crust of the globe showed itself independent of climatic influences. Everywhere, basalt rises in twin mountains and truncated cones; everywhere porphy-"], [70, "60 Doc. No. 69. ritic trap appears in grotesquely arranged masses, and granite in rounded summits.* Tlie outer belt of trap, occupying the extreme northern portion of Keweenaw Point, (see map,) is less than a mile in width, and preserves a great degree of uniformity throughout its entire course. It forms a seg ment of a circle; of which the Bohemian mountains may be regarded as the centre. The southern points of Mauitou island are dotted with patches of this igneous rock, while the greater, portion of the belt has crumbled beneath the action of the lake surf. From the extremity of Keweenaw Point, it extends westerly for about eighteen miles in a curvi linear direction, and passes into the fake at the eastern point of Sand bay. Throughout most of this distance it is protected from the action of the surf by a thick belt of conglomerate, but at several points the water has broken through this sea-wall and excavated spacious harbors in the igne ous belt. Copper, Agate, Grand Marais, and Eagle Harborsare included in this belt, and owe their origin to a common cause. This belt is composed of the varieties of igneous rock known as amyg daloid and brown gianular trap. The amygdaloid is best developed in the upper portion of the belt, where it comes in contact with the conglom erate, presenting a dark scoriaceous mass, full of vesicles, somewhat compressed, and bearing a close resemblance to certain modern volcanic products. These vesicles are, for the most part, filled with carbonate of lime, chlorite, agates, carnelians, and amethysts, and minerals of the zeolite family. As we penetrate deeper into the belt, the vesicular structure dis appears, and the rock passes into a dark brown granular trap, consisting of an intimate union of hornblende andlabrador. This is its general character; and to cite the numerous places where it has been observed, would be to encumber the report with unnecessary detail. This belt is traversed by veins containing copper and silver, several of which have been mined, but in every instance unsuccessfully. At Eagle Harbor, a company wrought a vein, which, for a time, yielded a rich per ceutage of copper. Between 5,000 and 6,000 pounds were taken from the vein- within a comparatively limited space; but as the miners sank deeper, the copper disappeared. The range of the vein was limited on the south by the conglomerate, and on the north by the lake. At tlie surface it was two feet in width, and filled in with laumonite and native copper. The shaft was commenced about two hundred feet north of the junction of the rocks, and extended to the depth of ninety seven feet. At that depth the vein had contracted to three inches, and was barren o\u00a3 copper. The best mining-ground is undoubtedly beneath the bed of the lake; but to reach it would require a deep shaft, a long gallery, and an expensive apparatus for ventilation. The company were not disposed to embark in an undertaking, the labor of which was certain, while success was precarious. Several other veins in the northern range were explored by the company, with no better results. At Hawes's island, near Agate Harbor, a vein was opened by the Cy press River Company, which yielded rich specimens of copper and silver, but, in the downward progress, they disappeared. With a single exception, (northwest quarter of section 58, range 30,) we have excluded every tract within this belt from the list of mineral lands believing that it contains no veins which will be permanently productive! * Aspects of Nature, vol. II."], [71, "Doc. No. 69. 61 To the west of Sand bay about ten miles, and north o^ the first trap pean range, naiyow belts of trap have been observed in two places, to wit: on section 28, township 58, range 32; and on sections 1 and 6, between ranges 32 and 33, township 57. The nature of the ground is such that they can be traced but a short distance inland. Whether they are~a pro longation of the belt just described, or detached, intercalated masses, it is impossible to determine. The character of the rock is highly amygdaloi dal, and chlorite enters largely into its composition. Imperfect indications of veins exist, one of which was explored by the Lake Shore Mining Company yielding little or no copper. In the more compact varieties, a concretionary structure is sometimes observable. Parallel bands of different colors, a few inches in width, traverse the mass in waving lines, or are arranged in circular forms. This same arrangement is seen more strikingly illustrated in the trap on Hays s Point, near Copper Harbor. The direction and arrangement of these lines is illustrated in Fig. 3, the above wood cut. This structure is occasionally found in all igneous rocks, and undoubtedly results from chemical affinity, by which the par ticles assume a concretionary arrangement. About a mile south of this trap belt, and separated from it by a deposit of conglomerate and coarse sandstone, which, in places, expands to a thickness of more than 3,0L0 feet, occurs the northern trap range of Keweenaw Point. It will be seen, by inspecting the map, that these two belts of igneous rocks, in their westerly prolongation, preserve a remark able parallelism. This range does not appear to have been the result of one, but of suc cessive overflows; for we not only find the igneous materials arranged in parallel bands, and exhibiting great diversity in external characters, but we also find numerous intercalations of conglomerate of inconsiderable thickness, but extending for miles in a linear direction \u2014 these mixed pro ducts being associated in regular beds, having a common bearing and inclination, so that the inexperienced observer is inclined to refer the whole to a common origin. This deception is still further increased by observing lines of pseudo stratification in the trap conforming to those of the associated sedimentary rocks.* This range starts from the head of Keweenaw Point, below Manitou island, and, sweeping round in 'a crescent form nearly conforming to the trend of the coast, crosses the western arm of Portage lake, where it * This pseudo-stratification has been observed by De la Beche in ihe granite of Cornwall, and is supposed by him to result from a tendency in the materials of a cooling mass to arrange themselves in beds, particularly near the surface. \u2014 Geology of Cornwall."], [72, "62 Doc. No. 69. seems to lose its distinctive character. Towards the valley of the Little Montreal river, it crops out in bare precipitous cliffs; but the northwestern slope is gentle, the rock rarely emerging to the surface. The following are the elevations of this range at different points, as ap proximatively determined by the barometer: On section 13, township 58, range 2S, 467 feet. On the line between sections 15 and 16, township 58, range 29, about three miles inland from Grand Marais Harbor, 730 feet. Between the Copper Falls and the Northwestern mines, section 24, town ship 58, range 31, 630 feet. This range skirts the valley of Eagle river on the west, and rises in overhanging cliffs to the height of two or three hundred feet. \"The Albion cliff, near the northwest quarter of section 10, township 57, range 32, may be regarded as the culminating point, attaining an altitude, as determined by Mr. Hodge, of 800 feet above the level of Lake Superior. Between the Albion mines and Portage lake, the hills present for the most part a rounded outline, and the underlying rocks are covered over with accumulations of water worn materials. Interstratified with this belt, throughout its entire range, we observe numerous lenticular masses of conglomerate, which appear to affect the courses of veins, as well as their productiveness. The phenomena ex hibited by the passage of a vein through different belts of rock will be described in detail under another head. Local details. \u2014 The trap at the eastern extremity of Keweenaw Point (sections 15 and 22, township 58, range 27) is more compact and crystalline than the northern belt before described, and is traversed by small veins containing native copper. Near the centre of section 22, a band of conglomerate from fifty to one hundred feet in thickness is ob- served, dipping to the north; but it can be traced only for a short distance inland, in consequence of the drift which there reposes on the rocks. A few yards south of the extremity of the point, and near the north line of section 27, a band of conglomerate is observed, attaining a thickness of sixty feet, bearing N. 70\u00b0 W., and dipping NE. 16\u00b0. The underlying trap differs from that which overlies the detrital rocks, being more amyg- daloidal, and offering less adhesion between the particles This is sup- Pu\u00b0Se^-S-bvra continuation of the great metalliferous belt, as developed at the Ohft, iNorth American, and Northwest mines. In this township (58) numerous explorations were made by the Bos- ton and Lake Superior Mining Company; and, although they found native copper at several points, they did not succeed in developing a val- uab e vein In the adjoining township west (range 28) and north of the Little Montreal river, four alternations of trap and conglomerate were ob- served. Near the conglomerate ridge, the trap is low; but, north of the Montreal river, it rises in elevated cliffs, which continue through the township, ranging in an easterly and westerly direction. These cliffs nletpCT?\u00b0h , h\u00b0\u2122blende, in large acicular crystals, imbedded in a paste of labrador Near their base is seen a band of conglomerate from twenty to fifty feet in thickness, dipping north at an angle\u00b0of 40\u00b0 wH can be traced almost uninterruptedly for a distance of Twenty-five mS At the Chff and North American mines there is a bed of chlorite roc] \" corresponding in position to this baud.

No. 69. 63 but, being more destructible than the cliffs of overlying greenstone, it is rarely exposed on the surface. In township 5S the Massachusetts Mining Company opened several veins in the vicinity of the Montreal river, mone of which proved pro ductive. The Alliance Company tested to a limited extent a vein on section 8. The Pittsburg and Boston Company also held a location, which they subsequently abandoned. This ridge extends in an easterly and westerly direction through ranges 29 and 30. In the latter range (township 58, section 15) is situ ated the Northwest mine. The thin band of conglomerate before de scribed is here exposed on the southern slope of the hill, with greenstone above and amygdaloid and compact trap below. In its passage through the adjoining ranges 36 and 35, (townships 58 and 57,) the trap chain curves rapidly to the southwest, and is prolonged in that direction. The following section represents .the relative position of the bedded trap and sandstone on the northern slope of the ridge (section 12) at the Copper Falls mine: Fig. 4. The first rock seen in the stream is amygdaloid, resting on sandstone, which bears north 78\u00b0 west, and dips 26\u00b0 to the north. The thickness of this trap belt could not be determined, the northern portion of it being concealed by drift. The sandstone is composed of coarse materials, and contains, in places, rounded pebbles. Near the line of junction it ex hibits the effects of metamorphism, being dark-colored and firmly cemented. Receding from the line, we find it variegated in color and less compact. To this succeeds another belt of trap, conformable in bearing and inclinaton, below which is another belt of sandstone . Thus there are no less than five repetitions of sandstone and trap within the distance of 2,000 feet. As a general observation, the upper portions of these sandstone belts are much more changed by heat than the lower \u2014 an important fact, which will be considered in discussing the origin of these rocks and their mode of for mation. The sandstone, where thus exposed, presents a compact texture, breaks with a ringifig sound and a conchoidal fracture, and exhibits many of the external characters of jasper. It is traversed by numerous divisional planes, which are quite as distinct as the original lines of bedding. The workings of the Copper Falls Company are in the 436-foot belt. Between the mouth of Eagle river and the Ph\u0153nix Company's works, eleven of these belts, thus intercalated, are noticed within the distance of a mile. Beyond the Albion range these belts cannot be traced, the rocks"], [74, "64 Doc. No. 69. being no longer exposed in bare ledges, but covered beneath accumula tions of sand, gravel, and clay. The trap beds thus intercalated are amygdaloidal or granular, but on their upper portions often exhibit a brecciated appearance. They afford numerous examples of veins yielding native copper and silver, but do not expand to a sufficient width to allow extended subterranean workings. The upper portion of the crystalline belt described as occurring in range 28, township 58, and thence traced through the intervening townships west, is exposed a few rods south of the upper shaft at the Ph\u0153nix mine. Here the feldspar predominates over the hornblende, giving the rock a light color. The vein is observed to be disturbed and otherwise affected as it approaches this mass. The Albion range is capped with this rock, which appears in abrupt precipices two or three hundred feet in height. At the Cliff mine, the upper portion of the precipice is composed of a dark crystalline green stone \u2014 the hornblende largely predominating, which exhibits a mottled or varioloid appearance. At the Albion mine the feldspar again predomi nates, and the rock becomes in some degree porphyritic. Beneath this is a bed of chlorite rock of a slaty structure, varying in thickness from six to'ten feet, below which we meet with a belt of amygdaloid and gran ular trap. Proceeding along the trend of the Albion range in a south westerly direction, the amygdaloid is found to dip beneath the surface. At the Cliff mine it is struck near the base of the precipice; but at the Albion mine, three miles distant, it is reached at the depth of ninety seven feet. This belt, the position and range of which we have endeavored to de lineate, is the most metalliferous of any on Keweenaw Point. Throughout its entire extent, it seems to be characterized by well-defined veins. In it are situated the Cliff, North American, Albion, Northwest, and North western mines; and it is reasonable to suppose that others equally valuable will be developed along the line of its outcrop. Southern trap range. \u2014 Returning to the head of Keweenaw Point, we find another range of trap, forming the southern boundary of the valley of the Little Montreal river, and stretching westerly in a line nearly par allel with the northern chain. This is, known as the Bohemian range, and differs from the northern both in lithological character and in the mode of its occurrence. While the former, before described, is composed of nu merous beds of trap, in the main of the amygdaloid and granular varieties, interstratified with the detrital rocks, the southern range consists of a vast crystalline mass, forming an anticlinal axis, flanked on the north by the bedded trap and conglomerate, and on the south by conglomerate and sandstone. The contour of the unbedded trap is also very different from that of the bedded trap. We nowhere recognise the stair like structure in the hills; they are either dome-shaped or rounded. The protrusion of so vast a mass of heated matter has changed in a marked degree the associated sedimentary rocks, causing them to resemble igneous products. Thus, on section 30, township 58, range 27, by the lake shore, is seen a metamorphosed sandstone resembling jasper. Its general bearing is east and west. In places it assumes a vesicular appear ance, while other portions are brecciated, and take into their composition chlorite and feldspar. In some hard specimens the lines of stratification can be recognised. The mass is- about 100 feet thick, and surmounted by"], [75, "Doc. No. 69. 65 alternating bands of porphyry and a chlorite rock known as rotten trap, which may be regarded as a volcanic ash. These veins attain a thickness of only a few feet. Proceeding along the southern coast of Keweenaw Point in a westerly direction, at the old fish station'(section 35) we again observe this metamorphosed rock forming one of the jutting points of the bay; but here it assumes a different character, as though it had been subjected to a heat more intense and longer continued. All traces of stratification have disappeared , and the rock has become transformed into a red, compact jasper, breaking with a conchoidal fracture, and traversed by numerous divisional planes. Where it comes in contact with the trap below it pre sents a homogeneous texture. All traces of its mechanical origin are obliterated, and it is difficult to determine where the igneous rock ceases and the aqueous begins. In section 30, township 58, range 27, west of the Little Montreal river, it is seen again on the coast. The Bare Hills here approach the coast and rise up in overhanging cliffs to the height of 80 feet, and jasper appears to be the prevailing rock. From this point it can be traced inland in a westerly direction, through sections 29 and 30, in the same township and range, to the west line of section. 24, township 58, range 29, expand ing to a width of about half a mile. The west line of this section passes over Mt. Houghton, an isolated and dome-shaped mountain, rising to the height of SS4 feet above the lake, and forming the culminating point in this portion of the region. Its summit is jasper for the distance of 150 feet, and it is difficult to trace any well-characterized lines of stratification in the mass. On the southern flank the mass apparently dips to the SS W. On the northern slope a perpendicular ledge, 20 feet in height, is observed, dipping slightly to the east; to the northeast two low ridges of jasper are seen bearing nearly east and west, and connecting with the Bare Hills by tlie lake shore. The rock is extremely fissile \u2014 so much so, that it is dif ficult to procure good specimens. In tracing it west, it gradually passes into a compact trap, with here and there an almond-shaped cavity, filled with quartz or calc-spar. This rock we suppose originally to have been sandstone, and the peculiarities which we have described to have resulted from contact with the mass of trap beneath. Unsuccessful attempts at mining near the summit of this mountain were made by the Alliance Company. Near Lac la Belle the Bohemian range attains the height of 864 feet; at its base, and between the trappean and detrital rocks, is a belt of chlorite in foliated masses which expands to about. 150 feet in thickness. The occurrence of a bed or mass of this mineral between trap and sandstone is not unfrequently observed in this district. The lower portion of the ele vation is here made up of a peculiar rock composed of chlorite and labrador in nearly equal proportions. These two minerals are each in a distinctly crystalline condition, and the feldspathic portion is of a light reddish color. The mass is filled irregularly with crystals of magnetic iron ore, which occasionally form a large portion of the rock. Particles of copper pyrites are also scattered through it. This variety of rock seems to pass gradu ally into the dark colored, fine grained greenstone which occurs on the summit of the mountain. 5"], [76, "66 Doc. No. 69. The following section, from Copper Harbor to Lac la Belie, exhibits not only the contours of the country, but the relative association of the detrital rocks and the bedded and unbedded trap : The Bohemian range, as before remarked, forms the line of upheaval of the bedded trap and conglomerate on the north, and the conglomerate and sandstone on the south. The conglomerate, north of the axis of elevation, rarely attains a greater inclination than 45\u00b0; but on the southern slope, the sandstone is observed dipping at an angle of 78\u00b0. This is beautifully ex hibited by the lake shore, on section 36, township 58, range 29. The sandstone is seen in the bottom of the bay, composed of alternating bands of white and red, sweeping round in curves, conformable to the course of the trappean rocks. As -we recede a few miles to the south, the strata are observed to be neaily horizontal. In the two adjoining townships west, this range preserves its distinctive character; but\" beyond, it sinks down, into sloping hills two or three hundred feet in height. It exhibits some lithological changes in its course : thus, at the Suffolk mine, now, abandoned, (section 16, township 57, range 31,) the rock becomes beautifully porphyritic \u2014 crystals of red labrador are scattered through a dark feldspathic base, with sulphuret of copper disseminated in irregular masses. This range, like the northern one, is traversed by veins for the most part at right angles to the direction of the forma tion; but, unlike the veins of the northern range, they yield the sulphurets of copper, Fig. 5. instead of native copper. The only mines now wrought are the Bohemian and Lac la Belle, which will be particularly described under another head. Numerous explorations have been made along the southern boundary of the trap, but in no instance successfully. The abandoned mines are in dicated by an appropriate symbol on the accompanying map. The fissile chlorite rock described as occurring at the base of the Bo hemian mountain is found to continue almost uninterruptedly to Portage lake, and always preserving the same relation to the trap and sandstone. The prevailing color is green, but in places it acquires a Teddish tinge. The trap, however, in the lower part of township 57, range 33, assimilates more to that of the northern range. At the Forsyth Company's Avorks, (section 33,) aband of greenstone is observed forming the crown of the hill, with amygdaloid resting beneath. In the adjoining township south, the trap is seen to occupy Low parallel ridges, and is exposed in the beds of"], [77, "Doc. No. 69. 67 the water-courses. Much of it is amygdaloidal, intermixed with the greenish and reddish fissile rock before described. Indications of copper exist, but the veins are not well defined. In the southwest quarter of section 8, the Trap Rock Company perforated the rock to the depth of seventy feet, then drifted sixty-six feet from the vein for the purpose of discovery. The veinstone here consisted of small strings of quartz, calc spar, and chlorite, arranged in parallel layers, to the width of ten inches, with some copper disseminated ; but the indica- tions were not sufficiently encouraging to induce them to continue the work. This vein ranges and dips with the formation \u2014 its course being north 50\u00b0 east; inclination to the northwest 60\u00b0. On the southeast quarter of section 19, township 56, range 32, are the abandoned works of the New York and Michigan Company. Their exploitations were prosecuted on the left bank of a small stream, near the junction of the trap and sandstone. The trap here consists of the reddish and greenish chlorite rock, with imbedded amygdaloid. The surface exhibits few indications of a vein; but, according to the report of Messrs. Grout <fc Douglass, who explored this location, native copper was found in the small veins and adjoining fissures. A drift was extended 45 feet into the rock; a shaft was also sunk on the opposite bank to the depth of 18 feet, intersecting a belt of the green rock, according to the above au thority, highly charged with copper. Although the workmen met with much to encourage, they did not succeed in developing a valuable vein. On one of the affluents of Torch river, (section 36, township 36, range 33,) the junction of the trap is beautifully displayed. The stream is precipitated over a wall of trap 80 feet in height, and thence winds its way through a deep gorge which it has excavated in the sandstone. The conglomerate differs from the lenticular bands described as occunug with the bedded trap, consisting of arenaceous particles loosely aggregated, and containing, near the base, quartzose pebbles. Patches of green and red ochrey clay occur in different parts of the mass, in a concretionary form. The red and green chlorite rock, fissile, but not stratified, enveloping masses of amygdaloid, is seen on the left bank of the stream, traversed by seams of quarts and calc-spar, underlying to the NW. 50\u00b0. Above this the rock is greenstone, presenting a wall-like appearance, and rising in overhanging cliffs. The precipice was perforated with a gallery, where the quartz seams are observed near its base, to the distance of one hundred feet. Several seams were crossed in the progress of the work which yielded native cop- per, but nowhere did the Arein concentrate with sufficient power and rich- ness to warrant the expenditure of much capital. This work was prose- cuted by the Douglass Houghton Mining Company, under the direction of Messrs. Grout & Douglass, and their report to the company contains a detailed account of their explorations and the character of the rocks. The trap in this vicinity has not that firmness and liveliness of color which belong to the truly metalliferous belts. Evidences of copper exist in the shape of small strings and leaders, but they nowhere concentrate and form what miners call a \"champion lode.\" The Quincy mine, (section 26, township 55, range 34,) near the west arm of Portage lake, affords as good a prospect for mining enterprise as"], [78, "68 Doc. No. 69. any which we have observed in this vicinity, although this cannot be re garded as among the best mining-ground. The rock here consists of a dark-brown chlorite trap, with beds of amygdaloid. Between the junction of these rocks native copper is ob served in sheets, and disseminated in a vein-stone of calc-spar and chlo rite. The veins, or rather the main lodes, range and dip with the formation, and send off branches at nearly right angles. t The culminating point of the trap here does not exceed 400 feet. The northern flank is covered with detritus, and the rock at rare intervals emerges to the surface. Hence there is really a small portion of the trap range in this vicinity which is adapted to mining. In the region of Portage lake, the shock by which the bedded trap and conglomerate were elevated does not appear to have been attended with the protrusion of vast crystalline masses, forming a long range, like the Bohemian mountains, or rounded groups, as in the vicinity of the Onton agon, but simply to have caused a vertical dislocation, lifting up the beds on one side of the fissure, while the corresponding beds on the opposite side remained comparatively undis turbed. There can be no doubt that there existed a deeply-seated and powerful fissure, extending from the head of Keweenaw Point to the western limits of the district, along the line of which the volcanic forces were, at different times, powerfully exerted \u2014 similar in character to those in Guatemala, Peru, and Java \u2014 the seats of modern volcanic action. Fi\u201e 6 The only instance observed in this part of the district, of trap occur ring remote from the line of the fissure is in the northest corner of town ship 49, range 36, fourteen miles southwest of the head of Keweenaw bay. It is known as Silver mountain, (lucus a non lucendoZ) which rises up isolated and dome-shaped to the height of a thousand feet, and occupies an area equal to three sections. The surrounding plain is covered with deep deposites of clay, resting on sandstone, in nearly hori zontal strata. The rock on the summit of the mountain consists of labra dor and hornblende, the former largely predominating, and arranged in dis tinct crystals, with nodules of quartz and chalcedony scattered through the mass. The flanks of the mountain exhibit nearly the same litho logical characters. Mining operations were prosecuted there a few years since by the National Company. The hill was perforated by a gallery to the distance of one hundred feet, along the course of a fissure, dipping 63\u00b0 to the northwest. The attle which lay about the opening was mi nutely examined, but we failed to detect any traces of copper; nor did the appearance of the wall-rock or the fissure afford any well-founded hopes of the presence of metalliferous deposites. The rock at the entrance of the adit appears to have been broken by the elevatory movement, or suc cessive movements, to which the mass had been subjected; for we found the enclosing walls, ground and polished. In other places rounded fragments of the wall- rock were included in the fissure. Near the mouth of the adit the rock was compact, but, on penetrating further, it became highly crystalline. Scori\u00e6 and amygdaloidal patches were observed"], [79, "Doc. No. 69. 69 iw the fissure, as though they had been injected after the upheaval of the mass. Near the summit a dike is seen pursuing a zig-zag direction. Boulders of granite a foot in diameter and fragments of sandstone are strewn over the summits. Deep grooves and scratches, bearing north 20\u00b0 east, are seen in this firm and crystalline rock. Although this is the only instance observed of the protrusion of the igneous rocks through the sedimentary strata in this vicinity, yet evidences of volcanic disturbance exist; and we have reason to believe that erup tive masses have approached near the surface, without breaking through the exterior crust. Thus, about one-half of a mile from the southern boundary of township 50, a conical knob of sandstone, having a quaquaversal dip, is observed, the strata being much fractured and disturbed. These explorations were conducted by Mr. Hill. \u25a0RANGE OF THE TRAP BETWEEN PORTAGE LAKE AND THE MONTREAL RIVER. External characters. \u2014 Between Portage lake and the Fire-Steel river, the trappean rocks are less distinctly marked than on Keweenaw Point. They appear in rounded groups, rather than in parallel chains; but be yond this point they again rise in bold cliffs, which attain an eleva tion of nearly fourteen hundred feet near Agogebic lake, when they again sink down into a nearly level plain, with an occasional isolated knob. This is their character between the last-mentioned point and the Montreal river. The Porcupine mountains form a lateral branch of the main trap range, and constitute nearly the highest points in the district. The trappean rocks are extremely variable in their lithological character, and among them the following varieties may be recognised: 1 . Compact trap \u2014 varying in color and texture, and occasionally taking into its composition a large proportion of chlorite and a greenish magnesian mineral. Some varieties are exceedingly fine-grained and close in their texture, so that they break almost with a conchoidal fracture; others contain a very large percentage of magnetic oxide of iron, and, if the block have an angular, prismatic form, and remain for some time on the surface, it acquires magnetic polarity. To the presence of so large a proportion of iron is undoubtedly due the irregular variation of the needle so well known to the linear surveyors in the districts underlaid by this class of rocks. The fluctuations of the needle often indicate the presence of the trappean rocks where they are effectually concealed by a thick covering of detritus and soil. 2. Amygdaloid. \u2014 This variety is found irregularly scattered through the trap, but by no means so abundantly as west of the Ontonagon river. The base of the amygdaloidal trap is generally a fine-grained, homoge neous, dark colored mixture of hornblende and labrador, with numerous amygdules\u2014 some of which are an inch in their longitudinal direction \u2014 filled with different mineral substances. Between the Algonquin lo cation and Agogebic lake, epidote frequently accompanies the amygdaloi dal trap; west of the last named place, it resembles more nearly the trap of Keweenaw Point, and is associated with large quantities of the zeolites. Where epidote fills the cavities of the trap, it presents a radiated, crystal lized texture, and specimens of great beauty are frequency obtained. Generally the vesicles of the epidote are occupied by quartz, often radi-"], [80, "70 Doc. No. 69. ated. The quartz is frequently colored green by the presence of epidote, and in such cases affords beautiful cabinet specimens. The zeolitic minerals often form so large a portion of the rock that it disintegrates and falls to pieces after a short exposure. At the Atlas Mining Company's location, (section IS, township 50, range 44,) now- abandoned, they are so abundant that they are found not only in all of the vesicles of the trap, but are distributed through it in large vein like sheets. 3. Porphyritic trap. \u2014 The base of this rock consists of fine-grained trap, through which are diffused long and distinct crystals of feldspar, which, being white, standout against the dark base in bold relief. This variety is found in loose blocks south of the trap range; but it has not been observed in place in this portion of the district. 4. Trap breccia. \u2014 This is a mixture of amygdaloidal trap and quart- zose fragments resembling altered sandstone, and seems to have been the product of the interfusion of the two rocks; it is seen at the Cushman location, near the forks of the Ontonagon, (section 36, township 50, range 40,) and also a rock somewhat similar in character is observed at the United States Company's location, a mile or two west. 5. Epidote trap. \u2014 This variety occurs atmany points, especially in the vicinity of the Ontonagon river, occupying a space of several miles in length. The compact trap often passes gradually into it, the epidote re- placing the hornblende. The seams of quartz and calc-spar containing copper are almost always accompanied by epidote, which graduates on either side' into compact trap. The varieties of epidote rocks are as numerous as those of the green- stone trap. Both, in fact, occur together over a considerable portion of the district; and though the proper trap is by far the predominating rock, yet there are sections where the epidote forms almost mountain masses. The epidote, however, is rarely pure, but generally mixed with quartz, forming nodules of considerable size. Where the -former occurs in seams, or veins, it is much more pure, and possesses a crystalline structure, though distinct crystals of this mineral are of rare occurrence. Like the proper trap, it often becomes amygdaloidal, the amygdules being filled with quartz and calc-spar. On the United States location the trap and epidote are seen in alternating hands, the cavities of the former being filled with epidote and quartz, and those of the latter with quartz and calc-spar. 6. Compact quartz, or jasper .\u2014This rock occurs abundantly in mountain masses, the highest summits of the Porcupine mountains being composed of it. It varies in structure considerably at different points. The greater part of it, however, is a homogeneous compact jasper of a deep, brick-red color, sometimes traversed by thin seams lined with crystals of quartz. The jasper is occasionally divided by fine lines or bands, waved or con- torted, so as to form an imperfect ribbon jasper, but at other points particles of white quartz are mingled with the red jaspery mass. The compact variety of quartz rock sometimes shows a gradual passage into quartzose porphyry, with occasional imbedded crystals of feldspar. The quartzose porphyry occurs in very large masses, forming the highest points of the trap range in townships 49 and 50, range 42, on the head-waters of Iron river. It is of a brick-red color, and contains small crystals of white feldspar, not generally exceeding an eighth of an inch in length. Almost invariably, fine rounded particles of vitreous quartz are"], [81, "Doc. No. 69. 71 found distributed with the feldspar through the jarpery base. It forms an eruptive mass, and oftenincludes fragments of the pre-existing igneous aud sedimentary rocks. Tnis porphyry has generally a trappean structure, breaking by natural joints into blocks more or less prismatic. A singular nondescript rock occurs in a low ledge which crops out on section 33, township 49, range 43. It has a feldspathic base of a light reddish color, through which irregular crystals of red feldspar and small rounded particles of quartz are discernible, intermixed with a greenish mineral, which appears to be epidote. It differs entirely in external char- acters from any rock found elsewhere in the district. Rano-e and extent \u2014 associated metals\u2014 The trappean range between Portage lake and the Ontonagon river divides the country into two parts \u2014 the portion lying on the north' being drained by streams which flow at nearly right angles to the formation, while in that portion lying south the streams flow nearly parallel with it. The trap range crosses Portage lake in township 55, ranges 33 and 34\u2014 its width being about three miles \u2014 and continues in a southwest course nearly parallel with the lake. In town- ship 52, range 36, it contracts to less than a mile in width. Between this point and Portage lake, trap is seen in the beds of the water-courses, and along the water-shed line. Low rounded hills occur, with few exposures of the rock. Within this distance there is no valuable mining-ground, and only one attempt at exploration has been made. The Old Settlers' Company explored a vein, or seam, on section 6, township 52, range 35, the course of which is north 65\u00b0 east, parallel with the course of the trap. This seam in no place exceeds four inches in width, and is silled with quartz and epidote, with particles of native copper disseminated. The drift was extended for 30 feet. On section 36, township 53, range 36, a shaft was sunk ;ipon a seam of similar character; but the nature of the rock gave little assurance of a valuable vein. West of township 52, range 33, the trap again expands, occasionally emerging in bold precipitous cliffs. Between this point and the Ontonagon river the rock is in many places metalliferous, and affords good mining- ground. It does not range in continuous chains, but appears in rounded groups or isolated knobs. At the Algonquin mine (section 36, township 52, range 35) the trap is rather compact, and much mixed with epidote. The ridge here bears northeast, and the escarpment is to the northwest \u2014 forming an exception to the general rule found to prevail in this region. At the Douglass Houghton mine, four miles southwest, the trap appears in numerous knobs and short broken ridges, and affords good mining-ground. Masses of vein- stone, consisting of quartz colored rose-red by the sub-oxide of copper, are found in the streams, indicating the proximity of veins. On section 15, township 51, range 37, this company have explored an east-and-west vein which promises to yield a profitable return. The rock is a dark- colored, compact trap, occasionally amygdaloidal, traversed by numerous joints, the intervening spaces of variable width, being occupied by quartz and calu spar. A detailed description of the works will be found under the head of Mines. On the neighboring section, 21, the New York and Michigan Company have made merely surface explorations. There are here two well-defined and abrupt ranges of trap crossing the line between sections 16 and 21, hi which several veins of metallic copper and blue carbonate of copper"], [82, "72 Doc. No. 69 were discovered by Messrs. Grout and Douglass, who explored the loca tion. We found the same appearances here as at numerous other points in the trap range in this vicinity, to wit: epidote occurring massive and in termixed with the trap rock, and containing a small amount of copper. Nothing, however, was found worthy of particular notice. The ridges of trap are elevated about a hundred feet above the general level of the country, while the intervening ground is low and swampy. About 10 rods southwest of the cabin there is a trap knob which rises to the height of 660 feet \u2014 the most elevated point in the immediate vicin ity. On the line between 29 and 30 the ground was found to be 633 feet. The trap here is amygdaloidal, with few indications of copper. In the adjoining township west (township 51, range 38) the trap rises in broken ridges to the height of 150 feet above the surrounding country, presenting mural faces to the somh. It consists for the most part of hard, crystalline greenstone, and is traversed by numerous contemporaneous fissures, which are filled with quartz and calc-spar, aud contain copper, disseminated, and in masses weighing 15 and 20 pounds. We saw in the northern portion of the belt no well-defined veins; and, altogether, the character of the rock is unfavorable for mining. The epidote and quartz are occasionally observed in beds, associated with native copper, having a course and dip corresponding with the ad jacent stratified rocks. The Adventurers' Mining Company and theRidge Mining Company are located in this township \u2014 the former on the southeast quarter of section 35; the latter on the southwest quarter of the same section. In the southwest quarter of section 25 a vein was observed in a ridge which extends across that quarter section, bearing north 55\u00b0 east, and dipping to the northwest 45\u00b0. The veinstone was prehnite and calc-spar, and contained traces of native copper. The foreign matter would not ex ceed one foot in width, but the brecciated rock occupied three feet. The Aztec Company are also working a small force in the southeast quarter of section 25, in this township. In the southeastern portion of this township the rock appears more favorable for metals, but the explora tions have not been- carried sufficiently far to develop the true character of the veins. The trap range in the adjoining township southwest is highly metal liferous\u2014as much so as any in this portion of the district. Township 50, range 39. \u2014 As this is an interesting township in regard to its topographical features, and one in which perhaps more mining and exploring have been done than in any other, we will give a somewhat general description of its geology and topography before entering into a particular description of the several explorations and attempts at mining which have been made. The Ontonagon river runs diagonally across the township in a winding course, separating it into two unequal portions. The three main branches of the stream, called respectively the East, West, and Middle forks, unite in sections 27 and 28, and form a broad river, which, however, is much broken by rapids, and can only be ascended by boats forced up against the current by setting poles. The banks of the river are generally of red clay, sometimes rising one hundred feet above the stream, and worn into precipitous ravines, commonly called \" hog backs,\" which succeed each other many times in the course of a mile. To travel over them is a task at once laborious and vexatious. The trap"], [83, "73 Doc. No. 69. range enters the township at the northeast corner, and pursues nearly a northeast and southwest difection diagonally through it. On the east and west line of section 12, there are two distinct ridges: the northernmost and highest is 736 feet above the lake, at the point of intersection. These ridges continue tolerably distinct and parallel in direction nearly to the Ontonagon, when they gradually break off; and where the river cuts through the range no rock is seen in place, but high clay banks hem in the channel. The terminating knobs of these ridges are con spicuous objects from a distance, and are known as the \"Three Brothers.\" The North and Middle Brothers are the proper terminations of the two parallel ridges ; but the South Brother is a spur of the southern ridge. The height of the Middle Brother above the lake is 758 feet; the other knobs and ridges in the township are from 650 to 670 feet. From the summit of the northern ridge the ground verges very gradually to the lake, there being no other breaks than ravines worn by running water. South of the trap range there is a beautiful level plateau of land, finely timbered with maple and hemlock; then succeeds a broken and uneven country, intersected by numerous gullies. In tlie beds of the streams sandstone may be seen in place occasionally, though they are mostly excavated in red clay. The current is generally sluggish. The west branch of the Ontonagon flows along the line of junction between the sandstone on the south and the trap on the north; and it was on the left bank of this stream, near the water's edge, in sec tion 31, of this township, that the famous \" copper rock,\" now at Wash ington, was found. To facilitate its removal, a road was constructed to the main branch of the river on section 20, which is known as the \" Copper- rock road.\" The trap is flanked on the north by a belt of conglomerate which bears west-southwest, and occupies a width of one-fourth of a mile. Numerous alternating bands of igneous and aqueous rocks are observed in this township, or rather in the northern portion of it. The trap ranges differ somewhat in lithological character. The north ern range, as exposed on section 10, is somewhat porphyritic. Between this and the second range there is a belt of sandstone 100 feet in thick ness, which is well exposed on section 16. The middle range is capped with greenstone, while its base consists of a granular trap, with occasional amygdules dispersed through it, com posed of hornblende, feldspar, and chlorite \u2014 forming the most metal liferous belt in the region. At the base of this belt a thin band of con glomerate is observed about 10 feet in thickness, dipping north 52\u00b0. Be tween the middle and southern ranges there is probably another band of conglomerate concealed by the soil. The southern range is composed of a dark brown trap, more compact than the former, but likewise metal liferous. The \" South Brother\" is somewhat isolated, and may be regarded the most recent in geological age, since the sandstone dips from it on the south, and the bedded f.rap and conglomerate dip from it on the north. The principal workings in this township, east of the river, have been prosecuted on sections 15, 16,21, and 22. The Minnesota Company, on section 16, have a valuable mine, a detailed description ot which will be given under the appropriate head."], [84, "Doc. No. 69. 74 The Ontonagon Mining Company sank a shaft on section 22 to the depth of 40 feet, which afforded ihdications\u00bbof little value. The rock brought to light consisted of a mingled mass of epidote and trap, traversed by seams of calc spar and quartz, with traces of native copp\u0153r. Associated with it were panicles of oxide of iron, having a metallic lustre, which were mistaken for gray sulphuret of copper. Another shaft was commenced near the northwest quarter of section 11, but soon abandoned. The principal shaft sunk by the company was on section 16, near its eastern bouudary, and was carried to the depth of 60 feet, through trap which afforded no evidence of a vein. On the west side of the river, explorations were made on the northeast quarter of section 19, under the direction of Mr. Randolph. The hill was perforated to the distance of 30 feet along the course of a supposed vein, when he found it cut off, as the miners termed it, by a wall of hard, compact trap. Near the seam, and against it, the rock is amyg daloidal, the cavities of which are filled with calc spar, epidote and quartz. In the space of six or eight feet from the seam, the rock grad uates into a hard, compact trap, and every trace of a vein is obliterated. The quantity of copper found at this locality was exceedingly small, though some specimens yielded as high as 15 or 20 per cent., and was finely interspersed through the rock. The Forest Mining Company are exploring some veins west of the river, with very flattering prospects, a description of which will be found under the head of Mines. The mining attempts on section 31, by the Ontonagon Company, will be alluded to in connexion with their operations on the adjoining sec tion in range 40. / In addition to these explorations, numerous shafts have been sunk and adits driven into the clay banks which border the river, by sanguine adventurers in search of mineral wealth. Near the spot where the cop per rock was found, numerous attempts of this kind were made. The true sources from which the loose masses of copper have been derived are now fully understood, and fruitless explorations of this kind have long since been abandoned. Township 50, range 40. \u2014 The trappean rocks west of the Ontonagon pursue a coprse which varies but a few degrees south of west. They here expand to a width of little more than four miles, and crop out north of the west branch in bold, overhanging cliffs. About one third of the northern portion of this township is occupied by the detrital rocks; while the mid dle, occupied by the igneous rocks, is low, and affords no valuable mining ground. In the southern portion, numerous explorations have been made by the United States and Ontonagon Companies. Those of the latter have been principally confined to section 36. Here a vein-like mass of epidote can be traced from the bottom to the top of a hill, and for a considerable distance along the course of the formation, which bears north 76\u00b0 east. This mass is nearly vertical, and is one of the largest aud best defined which we have seen. It has no perceptible walls, and on either side it may be seen graduating into the trap. A shaft has been sunk about half way down the hill, and a drift extended to intersect it be low. Other openings have been made at various points. Although some masses of native copper weighing fifty pounds were extracted, yet the"], [85, "75 Doc. No. 69. results, on the whole, could not be deemed satisfactory, for the copper is diffused too sparingly to render the workings profitable. This com pany also commenced explorations on section 31 in the adjoining town ship east. A vein-like mass of similar character, bearing nearly east and west, and dipping northwardly, waTs observed near the base of a cliff, into which a level was driven, without affording much encouragement to continue the work. \u2666 The United States Mining Company were located on sections 34 and 35. A superficial examination was made at the base of a trap cliff perhaps one hundred feet in height, where the rock consisted of trap mingled with epidote and quartz, presenting a singular brecciated appearance. No cop per was found. Beds of epidote may be seen in this ridge, having an ap proximate bearing east and west, in which traces of copper exist, but no where has it been observed in sufficient abundance to justify mining ope rations. On section 35, is a high cliff made up of irregular alternating bands of amygdaloidal trap and amygdaloidal epidote. Surface explorations have only been made here; in fact, there is nothing to warrant extended mining. Township 49, range 40. \u2014 The trappean rocks occur only in the extreme northern portion of this township. They rise in isolated knobs and bro ken ridges, north of the west branch of the Ontonagon, to the height of three hundred and even four hundred feet. Mining operations are for the most part restricted to the upper portions of the bluffs, so that, if sys tematically pursued, drainage can be effected with ease by means of adits. The Ohio Trap Rock Company are located on section 5, but most of their explorations have been made on section 12 in the adjoining town ship west. Township 49, range 41 .\u2014 The geological features of this township do not differ essentially from that last described. Bold cliffs border the river on the north, through which are distributed vein-like masses of epi dote containing copper. The cliffs extend through the township, not con tinuously, but in broken ridges, and form the principal mining ground. The trap continues northward about five miles, occupying about one half of township 50, but rarely emerges to the surface, and affords few facilities for mining. Sections 17, IS, and 19, in the western limits of the township, were re spectively occupied by the Hope, Ural, and Astor Companies. A bluff, occasionlly broken through by ravines, rises to the height of three hun dred or four hundred feet above the west branch of the Ontonagon river, m which masses of epidote and quartz, containing considerable copper, are arranged somewhat in the form of veins. In places they were observed to expand to the width of five or six feet, and afterwards contract to a mere seam, and sometimes run out altogether, or re-appear at a higher level in the cliff. There were no well-defined walls observed, and fre quently the epidote was seen to pass imperceptibly into compact trap. These tracts are now abandoned; but if these deposiles are found pro ductive after more extended exploitations, mining operations will undoubt edly be resumed at this point. The Ohio Trap Rock Company have performed much work in a bluff of a similar character on section 12, and at one time their prospects were regarded as highly flattering."], [86, "76 Doc. No. 69. Dr. Gibbs visited this tract in 1848, and from his notes we extract the following information: - \u2022 \"The general character of the rock is a compact trap, containing much epidote mineral, with quartz and calcareous spar. The epidote generally assumes the form of veins, intersecting the trap in different directions, but perhaps chiefly north and south or east and west. The copper is found principally in those veins which have an easterly and westerly direction. In one of these, which dips about 35\u00b0 to the north, two shafts have been sunk, one of which was 60 and the other 40 feet in depth at the time of our visit, and large quantities of epidote mineral, with quartz and spar, had been raised. The epidote frequently is rich in metallic copper, though as yet it has not been found in large masses. The copper is also disseminated, though sparingly, through the quartz, and affords specimens resembling those from the Cliff mine. The epidote is often beautifully radiated, and, when mixed with the white quartz and bright metallic copper, affords singular and beautiful specimens. At the bottom of the hill, a drift is in progress to meet the two shafts. The hill is about 130 feet in height, and the distance to be driven is about 300 feet, following the apparent course of the vein. Other openings have been made on the location and in this hill. They all present the same general character \u2014 namely, a vein-like seam of epidote, containing seams of quartz and calcareous spar, with particles of metallic copper. The frag ments of epidote are often covered with a coating of carbonate of copper, evidently derived by decomposition from the metallic copper. Sometimes the decomposed epidote and earthy matter form seams in the rock, which are regarded by the miners as a rich ore. On the whole, the quantity of copper obtained at the locality is sufficient to justify further exploration in proving the real nature of these deposites, though the occurrence of the metal in pseudo-veins will render the ultimate success of the operation a matter of some uncertainty. The appearance of the vein seemed, how ever, more promising as they descended upon it. The adit-level has since been constructed, but the vein-like mass did not prove as rich, where intersected, as was anticipated. The Boston and Lake Superior Company have made explorations on section 11, about one-fourth of a mile further west. The general char acter of the deposites of copper is similar to that of the Ohio Trap Rock Company. Two vein-like masses of epidote, mixed with quartz and calc-spar, meet at right angles \u2014 the one running nearly north and south, the other east and west. Two inclined shafts were sunk to the respective depths of thirty and sixty feet. The bed pitched to the north about 48\u00b0, and was thought to become richer in its downward course. This mine is temporarily, if not permanently, abandoned.\" This portion of the trap range appears to be richer than any other in the 'district west of the Ontonagon. It is characterized throughout by these \"epidote veins,\" as they are provincially termed, which in many places offer flattering inducements to miners; but it must be confessed that the explorations thus far have not demonstrated that they can be profitably wrought. Township 49, range 42. \u2014 The trap adjoins Agogebic lake on the north, and expands to the width of eight miles. The range of bluffs before described is continued through the southern portion of this township, and presents the same geological features. In the northern portion ara"], [87, "Doc. No. 69. 77 numerous high knobs of quartzose porphyry, in which no traces of copper have been detected. These extend in an east-northeast direction for about six miles, and vary in width from one to two miles. On section 24, known as Boyd's location, explorations to a limited extent have been made. Near the bed of the stream, by the cabin, occurs a mass of epidote, passing into trap, and containing specks of metallic copper. A small quantity of rock has been thrown out here, but the percentage of copper is very light indeed. At the southeast corner of the location, near the summit of a trap cliff 200 feet in height, occurs another mass of epidote rock, which has been explored in search of copper. This mass is about six feet in breadth by ten in length, and presents superficially some of the characters of a vein, but passes gradually into the trap both above and below, so as to be no longer distinguishable at the distance of a few inches. A few particles of copper are found in the epidote; but appear ances, upon the whole, are unpromising. About one fourth of a mile east of the cabin is the locality known as the \"Red oxide vein.\" The trap is very hard and compact, and contains epidote, which is sometimes stained by carbonate of copper. The seams of the trap are filled with thin plates of a red crumbly substance \u2014 proba bly decomposed laumonite. The epidote has, as usual, some resemblance to a vein. Considerable masses of ore have been obtained from this place, being mostly native copper incrusted with the red oxide, which is probably an after-product from the oxidation of native copper. Near this place is another opening of the same kind ; but no copper nor signs of a vein could be discovered. On the whole, there is no reason to suppose that mining operations at this point will be attended with success. The trap occupies only portions of the first tier of sections in the ad joining township (48) south. On section 6, the Charter Uak Company erected buildings and made surface explorations. The copper bearing rock is similar to that which is characteristic of the whole of this range, and to describe it more in detail would be superfluous. The location is now abandoned . From this range west to the Montreal river, (we speak not now of the Porcupine mountains,) the country is low and swampy, affording few facilities for mining operations. The rocks rarely emerge to the surface, and, when observed, are in isolated knobs, instead of continuous ranges. The bed of the Presqu' Isle was examined by us with great care, as well as the country lying west of the river, before the organization of the survey. The conglomerate is seen flanking the trap on the north, as well as intercalated with it in lenticular bauds. The juuction between the two classes of rocks occurs in section 26. Township 49, range 45. \u2014 The trap resembles that of Keweenaw Point, and, near the junction of the different mineral planes, is highly amygda loidal. The zeolites, so rare in the Ontonagon region, are here very abundant. A bed of quartz slightly tinged with the sub-oxide of copper is seen in the trap on section 26, near its northern limits. Numerous and appa rently contemporaneous fissures traverse the mass, which are filled with prehnite, laumonite, and calc-spar, through which native copper is diffused in small specks. Fissures of greater power, and apparently of a later age, cut the mass in a north and south direction, but they are rarely"], [88, "78 Doc. No. 69. metalliferous. Between Presqu'isle and Black rivers, occasionally, de tached knobs- of trap are observed, which afford no inducements to mining. The Cypress River Mining Company erected cabins on section 26, which were subsequently abandoned. The bed of Black river, above the point where the conglomerate and trap meet, exhibits few exposures of rock. On section 5, township 4S, range 46, the Chippewa Mining Company explored a vein in the bed of the stream to some extent, but developed nothing valuable, there being an ill defined vein through which native copper is sparsely disseminated. The trap here rises in hills two or three hundred feet in height, occasion ally exhibiting mural escarpments. Beyond these hills southward the country sinks down into a nearly level plain, covered with deep deposites of drift. Between the Black and Montreal rivers a low range of trappean hills runs parallel with the coast, but in no instance intersects it. To the south the country is low and swampy, but occasionally a trap knob rises up to diversify the monotony of the scene. The Montreal, a rapid, brawling stream, affords a good section of the rocks. For four miles above its mouth, it dashes through a deep gorge which it has excavated in the rocks, laying bare the bedded trap, con glomerate, and sandstone. The trap is both compact and amygdaloidal. The belt in proximity to the conglomerate is decidedly vesicular and con tains an abundance of the zeolitic minerals, in which occasional traces of copper are observed. There are numerous irregular veins of a hard, quartzose material, occasionally stained with copper, bearing north 55\u00b0 west, with a dip of 45\u00b0 or 50\u00b0 northwardly. They are very limited, and we do not consider them as affording any possible indication of valuable lodes. The Montreal River Mining Company occupied sections 23, 24, 25, and 26, township 48, range 49. The exploitations of the company were very limited, and the locations are now abandoned. PORCUPINE MOUNTAINS. These mountains, as will be seen by an inspection of the map, are an offshoot at nearly right angles from the main range, and form the cul minating points in the district, if we except a few points near Agogebic lake. They assume a crescent form \u2014 a peculiarity in the trappean rocks, which has been noted by Dr. Percival in his description of the geology of the State of Connecticut. The great mass consists of quartzose por phyry and jasper, though in other portions the amygdaloid is not want ing. Copper has been observed at numerous points, but no valuable lodes have been, nor probably will be, developed. To show the char acter of the rocks, and the association of the copper, we will advert to the principal points where explorations have been made. Township 51, range 42, section 27. \u2014 The Union River Company have here made quite extensive explorations \u2014 more so than any other company in the region. The seat of their mining operations is about two miles from the mouth of Union river, and is elevated 309 feet above the lake. A bed of trap, 500 or 600 feet in thickness, is included between parallel planes of sandstone, and dips northwest at an .angle of 25\u00b0. Along the line of junction between the sandstone above and the trap below, and occupying a thickness of about 5 feet, is a bed of amygdaloidal chlorite,"], [89, ""], [90, "null- 111 .ticterman ItA ' 37JJroadira.rXf CARP LAKE, PORCUPINE Mri"], [91, "Doc. No. 69. 79 containing copper in bunches and disseminated. On this bed two shafts have been sunk to the respective depths of 100 and 123 feet, and a gallery extended between them. Two vertical shafts were also sunk to intersect the inclined ones. The intention of the company was to make use of the hydraulic power afforded* by the stream to raise the attle. Subse quently another shaft was sunk farther north, through sandstone, which intersected the bed at the depth of 120 feet; but the attle thrown out disclosed only a trace of copper. The hanging-wall of sandstone afforded several very good specimens of silver. In contact with the foot-wall there was a thin seam of clayey matter, called by the miners Jlucait, consisting of decomposed chlorite. Near the surface copper was sound in considera ble masses, some of which weighed 50 pounds; but we could not gather that these occurred in the downward progress of the shafts. The copper here often forms a thin envelope around the exterior of the vesicles of the trap, while the middle is replaced by chlorite or calc spar. The mass brought to the surface was very meagre in copper, not exceeding one per cent. In the bed of the stream, a few miles above the mine, is a large mass of quartzose and sparry material in the trap, with chlorite interspersed, which has been explored to some extent. It has a reddish tint, commu nicated by the sub-oxyde of copper. The workings are now abandonded. Township 51, range 42 \u2014 On sections 22 and 27 the Boston Mining Company have made surface explorations, whieh resulted unfavorably, in a trap belt, which is an extension of that last described. There is a vein of quartz and silicate of lime, containing traces of metallic copper, which bears NE. and SW., and dips NW. at an angle of 30\u00b0 or 40\u00b0, and varies from eight to ten feet in width. The trap here is very much fractured, and contains seams of highly polished chloritic matter (slickeusides.) At the junction of the trap and sandstone, no signs of the bed wrought by the Union River Company are observable. Township 51, range 42, section 32. \u2014 Near the correction line, a shaft has been sunk to the depth of fifteen or twenty feet into the hard jasper, which remains a monument both of persevering industry and misdirected effort; since the difficulty of boring and blasting the close grained and tough silicious rock could only be equalled by the absurdity of attempt ing to mine a seam of clay in perfectly barren walls. Township 51, range 43. \u2014 This township has been the site of much mining exploration, and therefore deserves more than a passing notice. It is much broken by ranges of the Porcupine hills, and mural precipices extend from the centre of section 13 to 30. The highest point is 975 feet above the lake, and on the side opposite the coast presents a vertical face of several hundred feet, with a steep talus of angular fragments at the bottom. The trap, which attains a thickness of several hundred feet, is included within parallel planes of detrital rocks. This range bounds tlie valley of the Carp river on the north; while to the south, and within the distance of a mile, a second range is observed, composed of amygda loid, having rounded summits. Still beyond occurs the elevated range of quartz and jasper rocks, in which no trace of copper has been detected. Almost all of the explorations in this township have been made in the first range, near the junction of the trap and sandstone. On section 14, the Isle Royale Company explored a deposite of copper in some respects similar to that of the Union Company. The sandstone"], [92, "80 Doc. No. 69. masses of metallic copper, one of which weighed 55 pounds, were found here dips at an angle of 30\u00b0 to the north, and has been much altered by contact with the igneous rock. A seam, about a foot in width, consisting of blue plastic clay and chlorite, with rounded fragments of sandstone, is interposed between the two formations. In this seam directly in contact with the trap. An inclined drift was carried on the bed to the depth of 20 feet, but the traces of copper became more indis tinct. Several feet above was a seam of calc-spar, from one to four inches in width, and in some places expanding to a foot, intermixed with frag ments of the walls, forming a breccia; several feet below, a narrow seam, carrying metallic copper was observed, but it gave no evidence of being valuable. The annexed wood-cut is a section of the cliff at this point. About one-fourth of a mile west, the same company explored one of the vein like masses of epidote, associated with native copper, like those west of the On tonagon, bearing north and south, but it afforded little encouragement to persevere. Township 51, range 43. \u2014 The Delavan Company explored on sections 27 and 28. There are no regular veins or ap pearances of veins on either of these sec tions. The rock is epidote, passing into amygdaloidal trap, so intermixed that it is impossible to draw the line of demar- Fig. 7. cation between them. The amygdules are often filled with epidote, both pulverulent and crystalline \u2014 the bright green of the former forming a striking contrast with the dark brown of the latter. A shaft was sunk a few feet in the rock, which here presents a very brecciated appearance, traversed by numerous seams containing calc-spar and the zeolitic minerals. Traces of the gray sulphuret of copper were here observed, and also on section 21 ; on the adjoining section 32 the Croton Company sank a shaft in a similar rock, but found nothing to induce them to persevere. On section 30, the Isle Royale Company mined pretty extensively. The character of the rock is similar to that on section 14, before described. With regard to the Porcupine mountains it may be said, without hesi tation, that- there are no indications of copper of sufficient promise to warrant mining enterprises. There are no true, well-defined lodes, but irregular seams promiscuously scattered through the trap. We have endeavored to give, briefly, a synopsis of what has been done in the way of exploitation by the several companies. Originally, all of the trap belt was secured by perrnrts, and even portions of the sandstone. It will hardly be necessary to say that these permits were located at a time when the speculative fever ran high, and when the mere presence of trap was regarded as a sure inde\\ of the proximity of valuable lodes of copper. Before the expiration of 1848, nearly all of the companies in this region had abandoned their locations, regarding them as worthless; and, at the end of the succeeding season, there was not, to our knowl edge, a white man left."], [93, ""], [94, "i/TOW-SW^'.-^\" Plate IV COLUMNAR TRAP. ISLE ROY ALE"], [95, "Doc. No. 69. 81 ISLK ROYALE. In Miany respects, Isle Royale maybe regarded as the counterpart of Keweenaw Point. On both, the lines of upheaval are nearly parallel, ex- hibit the same banded structure, and yield the same metallic products. There are, however, minor differences. The conglomerates here are net developed on so grand a scale \u2014 different systems of fracture are found to prevail; but on both shores, the lines of inclination converge towards a oommon centre, forming a synclinal valley several hundred feet below the ocean-level, which is occupied by the waters of the great lake. We have seen that the Jesuits formed the most extravagant notions with regard to the mineral wealth of this island; and those notions, though greatly modified, prevailed among the explorers at a later day. Nothing, however, _as been revealed to justify those expectations; and the island, for mining purgpses, may be regarded as infinitely less valuable than Ke- weenaw Point, or the region in the vicinity of the Ontonagon. In an agricultural point of view, it is less valuable than any portion of equal extent in the district. The soil is scanty, and the timber which it sustains is dwarfed aud stunted. Range aud extent \u2014 meiollic contents. \u2014 The trappean rocks range rthrough the island in a northeasterly and southwesterly direction, forming aiumerous ridges, which seldom attain an elevation five hundred feet aLove the level of the lake. Almost everywhere they present a bedded structure, and the beds display marked lithological differences. The lines of bedding almost invariably are fount! to be coincident with the lines of stratification in the detiital roeks which occur on the southern portion of the island. A line drawn from the western extremity of the island, and cutting mid- way between Siskawit lake and the bay of the same name, would repre- sent the junction between the two formations \u2014 the igneous occupying the northern, the aqueous the southern portion. From the eastern point the line carves abruptly, and approaches the shore on the south. There is evidence of apowerful lateral dislocation here, by which one portion of the mass has been forced beyond the corresponding portion, thus interrupting the continuity of the strata. Other evidences of the same phenomena have been observed on other portions of the island, which will be described in the detailed geology. The length of the line occupied by the trap, from, Piielps's island, in Washington Harbor, to Passage island, which is an ex- tension of Blake's Point, is fifty one miles; its breadth varies from four and a half to seven miles. The physical obstructions to a successful ex- ploration of the interior of the island are greater than we have encountered in any other portion of the mineral district. The shores are lined with dense but dwarfed forests of cedar and spruce, with their branches interlocking aud wreathed with long and - drooping festoons of moss. While the tops of the trees flourish luxu riantly, the lower branches die off and stand out as so many spikes, to oppose the progress of the explorer. So dense is the interwoven mass of foliage that the noonday sunlight hardly penetrates it. The air is stifled; and at every step the explorer starts up swarms of musquitoes, which, the very instant he pauses, assail him. Bad as this region is' by nature,. man has rendered it still worse. Fires have swept over large tracts, con suming the leaves and twigs and destroying the growth, while the heaVy 6"], [96, "Doc. No. 69. 88 winds have prostrated the half-charred trunks, and piled them up so as to form almost impenetrable barriers. As we ascend the ridges, the maple and the birch replace the cedar and the spruce, and the physical obstructions become less formidable. These ridges occur at short intervals, and preserve a great degree of parallelism\u2014 bearing northwest and southeast, and are uniformly precipitous on the north, and gently sloping on the south. The valleys between are occu pied bv swamps, clothed with a dense growth of resinous trees, or with small lakes arranged in chains. The coast of the island is rock-bound, and, like Iceland, intersected by numerous feiords, or narrow and deeply indented bays. In describing the detailed geology, we commence at the eastern ex tremity of the island, and thence proceed west. Range 32.\u2014 Passage island occurs within this range. It is three miles _ros_ the nearest point of the main land, and was fabled as possessing _ocks of pure copper, so skat when a stone was cast against them a sound _ke that proceeding from brass was emitted. It is two miles in length, and its shores are rock bound, but indented with numerous bays, which afford excellent boat-harbors. The prevailing rock is a dark vanoloid trap, which rises near the centre of the island to the height of more than one fiundred feet, intersected by numerous veins running north and south, _at nowhere affording much inducement for. mining enterprise. Ranze 23, townships m and bl .\u2014 Within these townships are numer ous projecting headlands and deeply indented bays, known as the Fingers of Isle Royale. The southern portion of Rock Harbor is bounded by a reef of islands, twenty-four in number, arranged in a linear direction. Th\u00ab sock'is a dark -gray trap, not very firm, and occasionally contains amyg dules, filled with agate, chlorite, chlorastrolite, calc-spar, &c. A narrow _elt of conglomerate is. seen intercalated in the trap, bearing northeast and southwest, and dipping southeast 12\u00b0, and good exposures occur on Cari bou and Mott's islands. A seam of calc-spar, about eight inches in thick cess, conforming tin course and inclination to the conglomerate, runs through several of these islands, which, in a region remote.from masses of limestone, may ultimately prove of economical value. On Mott's island and Shaw's island there are veins of considerable power, but, owing to the proximity of the lake, it was thought that they would never prove valu able, since it would be impossible to free the mines from water. SeoviWs Point. \u2014A capos dark-gray trap, breaking into cuboidal blocks, and well adapted to the purposes of construction, is here seen, forming the Fig. 8. northern boundary of Rock Harbor. It rises in cliffs thirty and even fifty feet in height, forming an excellent sea-wall. From the head of the harbor to the ex 1 tremity of the point \u25a0 there is not a pebble beach of any extent. Beneath the conv pact trap is a thin band of amygdaloid;"], [97, "Doc. No. 69. 83 below this a bed of columnar trap, which gradually rises as we advance northward. The columns are arranged in prisms of five, six and seven sides, broken by joints, at short intervals; but we nowhere observed the structure known as ball and socket. The adjoining sketch, taken on the north side of Scovill's Point, will convey a correct idea of the appearance of the columnar trap. I i In the compact trap a well-defined vein of considerable power is seen, bearing north of east and south of west, and extending almost uninter ruptedly from Ransom to the extremity of .the point \u2014 a distance of nearly nine miles. This has been explored at different points by the Ohio and Isle Royale Company, by the Siskawit Company, and by Messrs. Shaw and Scovill. The vein stone consists of chlorite, quartz, and calc spar, with native copper in thin sheets and in bunches, and in the com pact trap presents favorable indications, but, on entering the columnar trap, it rapidly contracts and becomes worthless. A more detailed description of this vein will be found under the head of Mines. The columnar trap is also seen on Blake's Point and on Silver island. The amygdaloid before described crops out on the southern side of the point. It is of a dark-brown color, and contains numerous agates and vein-like masses of pitch stone. On Blake's Point, the trap attains an elevation of 250 feet, and consists of a dark-gray varioloid greenstone, traversed by numerous belts of sienite, (crystalline feldspar and horn blende,) arranged in strataisorm masses. Copper is generally found dis seminated through these belts. On section 33, township 66, a vein can be traced, bearing north 50\u00b0 east, containing quartz, chlorite, and spar, with considerable copper. It is in the varioloid trap, but, at the depth of 15 feet, one of the sienitic bands occurs, in which the vein is ill defined. On the northwest quarter of section 33 is one of those natural monu ments which instantly attracts the eye of the observer, known as \"The Cloven Tower.\" The varioloid trap here rises in two columns to the height of abou sixty feet, which are separated from one another by an interval of only a few inches in width. They are very symmetrical, resembling obelisks, and altogether form' one of the most pleasing features in the scenery of the island. The varioloid trap skirts the southern coast of Duncan's bay, in bold overhanging cliffs. From their summits, the eye has au almost unlimit ed range. To the north, the Canada coast can be traced for more than a hundred miles: all of the prominent points \u2014 St. Ignace, the Paps, Thun der cape, Pie island, McKay's mountain, and Prince's bay \u2014 are distinct ly visible. The many inlets around the island, fringed with evergreens, are seen almost beneath the feet. To the east and south, a boundless expanse of water stretches out, unenlivened by sail or other evidence of man's works. In peculiar stages of the atmosphere, the outlines of Ke weenaw Point may be traced, resting like a cloud upon the verge of the horizon. The amygdaloid emerges from tiie base of these cliffs, and, for the most part, forms the underlying rock on Locke's Point. It is of a dark -brown color, and very soft, dipping southerty at an angle of 40\u00b0.

Where the sandstone is imposed on the trap, there is little evidence oT Fig. 10. its having been metamorphosed; but, on the other hand, where the trap rests on the sandstone, the line of junction is clear and well defined. The trap is less vesicular; and the upper portion of the sandstone belt, for the distance of three or four feet, is converted into a ribbon jasper, having a compact texture. These phenomena have been observed at numerous places both on Isle Royale and Keweenaw Point. The beds of sandstone are not shattered, nor does the igneous rock penetrate in the form of dikes. or ramifying veins. All the phenomena indicate that the igneous rocks were not protruded in the form of dikes between the strata, but that they flowed like lava sheets over the pre-existing surface; and that the sand was deposited in the fissures and depressions of the igneous belt, in some cases, while the mass was in an incandescent state. A bed of crystalline calc-spar, varying in thickness from six inches to two feet, is observed in Chippewa Harbor, and is well adapted to makiDg quicklime. Thin beds of epidote, containing native copper, are atso ob served, having a bearing and dip conformable to the sandstone. Such is the nature of the country, that it is impossible to trace these-"], [102, "88 Doc. No. 69. conglomerate bands to any considerable extent, but they profrabfyrwedge out in short distances, forming in fact lenticular bands. A. thin belt of conglomerate lines the northern shore of Conglomerate bay,'with a dip of 6\u00b0 to the southeast, and is protracted thence along the southern shore of Rock Harbor. A thin belt of sandstone occurs about a fourth of a mile north of Ransom and this is the farthest point north along Ihe line of the section at which the purely detrital rocks have been observed. Between the lake shore and Rock . Harbor, embracing: the fractional township 65 and the extreme southeast portion of 66, the jock is a dark compact trap, occasionally amygdaloidal, consisting of hornblende, chlorite,. and feldspar. The stratiform appearance in places is very maikedy par ticularly near Conglomerate bay, resembling in some respects a sedimen tary rock altered by heat. Occasionally a band of crystalline greenstone is found included in the softer rock. The ridges which form the Fingers of the island, before described,.ex tend through township 66, and present sew differences in external char acters. The crystalline greenstone which characterizes the middle-range, and. of which Blake's Point may be regarded as the prolongation, forms the culminating point on this part of the island. la tlie southwest quarter of section 15 it rises to the height of five hundred and thirteen feet. In crossing the island from Rock Harbor to Amygdaloid island, the trav eller encounters a series of sharp ridges, with intervening; swamps. The escarpments are invariably on the north side, while on the south the slope is gradual. The clusters of islands and headlands on the northern portion of this township consist of amygdaloidal aud compact trap,, but afford little encouragement for mining enterprise. The best mining- ground in this range is near\" the junction- of the two systems of rocks in township 65. The trap is traversed by numerous veins, some of which appear to be metalliferous. The main veins pursue an easterly and westerly course parallel- with the' formation, but dip to the northwest, thus forming nearly a right angle to the inclination of the sedimentary rocks. Datholite, in many cases, forms nearly the entire gangue. Numerous explorations have been made in this vicinity by the Ohio and Isle Royale Company, which will be noticed under the head of Mines. Range 35. townships 65 and 66. \u2014 Sandstone and conglomerate forms the projecting points by the lake shore in the southwest quarter of town ship 65. Along tlie line of junction the same phenomena are ob-: served as at Chippewa Harbor. The coast is lined by heavy masses of trap, with occasional indentations, which afford excellent boat-harbors. Powerful fissures traverse the rock in a northerly direction, and occa sionally afford indications of copper. On section 34 a vein of this kind has been explored to a limited extent. Stratiform masses of epidote, con taining copper, are also observed, included in the trap. Receding from the lake shore, the country becomes low, and the rock rarely emerges lo the surface. In the south part of the northwest quarter of section 24, amygdaloidal trap was observed, containing the zeolite min erals. It is exposed in the bed of the stream which connects Siskawit lake with the bay, almost in contact with the conglomerate, and is trav ersed by numerous and apparently contemporaneous fissures, occasionally affording traces of copper. After crossing the first chain of lakes, the country is intersected by"], [103, "Doc. No. 69. 89 many sharp ridges, sloping from the summit to the southeast, but breaking off abruptly in perpendicular cliffs to the northwest. The rock is a hard crystalline greenstone, with belts of porphyry similar to those before described. At the head of McCargoe's cove, the rock is amygdaloidal trap; but between this point and the lake shore, on either side, high cliffs of green stone occur. The same rock bounds the coast from the outlet of this cove to Todd's Harbor, intermingled with bands of porphyritic trap, having the regularity of sedimentary deposites. This appearance is parti cularly marked on the main shore, opposite Hawk island. The outer reef consists of amygdaloid which is also seen underlying the greenstone at the eastern extremity of Todd's Harbor. Occasionally veins running north and south traverse the greenstone, but are for the most part pinched and unproductive. The best vein of this class hitherto observed occurs on section 12, in the adjoining range west, and is wrought by the Pittsburg and Isle Royale Company, with a good prospect of success. Range 36, townships 64 and 65. \u2014 The northern coast of the island in this range is lined wjth high cliffs of greenstone, so little indented as to afford hardly a boat-harbor. It breaks into cuboidal blocks, and occasionally presents the banded structure before described. Numerous north -and- south veins are observed, and the gangue almost invariably exhibits traces of copper. In the interior, the main range of trap courses through the township in a northeasterly and southwesterly direction, but the subordi nate ridges are less clearly marked. The southeastern portion of town ship 65 is low, and the rock rarely emerges to the surface. The same remarks will apply to the fractional township 64. Near the southern border of Siskawit lake, the linear surveyors arc said to have discovered a vein of some promise; but it escaped our notice. Theyr also found on the shores of this lake a mass of native copper weighing about twenty pounds. The southern coast in this range consists of conglomerate and sandstone. Range 37, townships 64 and 65. \u2014 A line drawn from the southwest quarter of section J 3, in township 64, to the centre of section 31, will in dicate very nearly the junction of the two systems of rocks. In following up the small stream which flows into the northern arm of Siskawit ba3r, the trap is exposed for the first time on the northwest quarter of section 23. Numerous parallel ridges are intersected in crossing the island, which attain no great elevation. The highest range lies immediately north of Lac Desor, and consists of greenstone, affording no evidence of veins. The northern coast in this range is so girt with rocks that in rough weather it is impossible for the voyageur to effect a landing. Ransrc 3S, townships 6ia?id 65. \u2014 But a small portion of township 64 is embraced in the trap range, and the heavy accumulations of drift effect ually conceal the rock. A ridge of hills, two or three hundred feet high, skirts Washington Harbor on the south, which are so covered with debris that the rock cannot be well explored. Loose masses of veinstone have been observed on the flanks of the hills, which would seem to indicate the presence of veins. - Another elevated ridge occurs between Washington Harbor and the lake shore on the north. The rocks rise in bold, perpendicular cliffs, and from their summits the eye has an almost unlimited range. The shore is rock-bound, the cliffs ranging in almost unbroken lines, and presenting a wall like face towards the lake in many places a hundred"], [104, "90 Doc. No. 69. feet in height. Hugennin's cove is the only harbor in this vicinity in which the voyageur can take refuge. The cliffs along the shore exhibit numerous alternations of different igneous rocks. The following sketch was taken on section 28. Thin bands of porphyry are found imbedded in dark compact trap. They bear northeast and southwest, and dip south east 21\u00b0. Whether these al ternating bands are due to successive overflows of igne ous matter, or are the result of different affinities while the entire mass was in an incan descent state, we are not pre pared to say; but are inclined to the former opinion, since the lines of bedding are found to correspond with those of, Fig. n. the detrital rocks. At another point on the coast the following section was observed ; \"Feet. Inches. Compact trap, breaking into cuboidtl blocks ----- 15 Porphyritic trap ----------- 0 Compact trap -.--.--.--- Porphyritic trap ----------- 0 Compact trap ----------- Porphyritic trap ----------- 1 Compact trap ----------- 1 6 23 5 These alternations exhibited wejl-defined lines of junction, and pre served their parallelism along the face of the cliff, as far as exposed. The bearing and dip were the same as in the section before described. The lines of division pursued an undeviating course through the several bands. A small vein was observed at one point cutting vertically through these bands, and the veinstone exhibited marked changes in its passage through the different belts. At a point about one-half of a mile to the west, numerous alternations of compact trap and amygdaloid were observed, having the same regu larity in bedding and inclination. We have observed this banded structure in the igneous rocks, at short intervals, from Blake's Point nearly to Washington Harbor, a distance of forty-five miles; and throughout the entire extent of the island they pre sent a remarkable uniformity in bearing and inclination. They were, un doubtedly, deposited at first in nearly horizontal sheets, and owe their present inclination to the same upheaval which uplifted the associated sedimentary rocks. We regard them as purely igneous products, and not as the result of metamorphism. Range 39, townships 63 and 64. \u2014 Between Hugennin's cove and Washington Harbor, the trap lines the coast in overhanging cliffs a hun dred and fifty feet in height. In rounding the end of the island, where-"], [105, "Doc. No. 69. 91 the different beds of unequal firmness have been exposed to the action of the surf, numerous coves are observed walled up on either side, and skirt ed at the extremities by agate beaches. Rounded masses of prehnite containing copper are abundant on all of the islands, and several beautiful specimens of silver have been picked up in the same association. Phelps's island, on the southern side of the harbor, holds out strong in ducements for mining enterprise. On the southeast shore (section 10) is a vein, bearing south-southeast, 18 inches wide, cotitaining calc-spar, prehnite, and native copper. Still further to the east is another vein of great power, bearing nearly north and south, and thirty inches in width. The veinstone consists of quartz, laumonite, and prehnite, with native copper disseminated. On the southeast quarter of the same section is another copper-bearing vein, well defined, and seven inches in width. Appended to this chapter will be found a tabular list of the tracts in this district supposed to contain copper. In designating such lands as were regarded as mineral, we have been governed by the following considerations: All of that portion underlaid by sandstone and conglomerate has been excluded \u2014 experience having demonstrated that, although they contain traces of copper, no valuable lodes need be expected. We have restricted the mineral lands to such portions of the trap ranges as were sufficiently elevated for mining purposes, where the rock was exposed on the surface, and, from its external characters and proximity to veins of known value afforded evidence of productive lodes. Although the Porcupine mountains afford good exposures of the rock, and contain abundant traces of copper, neither the character of the veins nor of the containing rocks affords a reasonable prospect for successful mining. For this reason, we have included no portion of it in the list of mineral lands. The same remarks will apply to the trap range in the vicinity of the Montreal river. In designating the mineral lands on Isle Royale, we have encountered much difficulty. The metalliferous bands, as we have seen from the de tailed geology, are extremely narrow, particularly in the northern portion; but the physical obstructions were such as to prevent a successful explo ration inland. We have accordingly designated such tracts as were suf ficiently elevated above the lake for mining purposes, and gave evidence of being metalliferous, without reference to the thickness of the belts."], [106, "S\u00a3 Doc.

Having attempted, with some degree of minuteness, in the preceding chapter, to set forth the boundaries, range, extent, and peculiarities of the igneous rocks of the copper region , it now remains to describe the as sociated sedimentary rocks, which may be regarded as nearly contempo raneous. These may be comprised under three divisions, to which are appended the equivalents in the Ifew York classification: I. Conglomerate. \u2014 Not strictly a sedimentary rock, but a volcanic tuff. II. Inferior sandstone. \u2014 Potsdam sandstone. III. Compact or lower magnesian limestone. \u2014 Calciferous sandstone, Chazy limestone, Bird's-eye and Black river limestone. I. Conglomerate \u2014 external cJmractcrs. \u2014 The conglomerate of Kewee naw Point and Isle Royale consists of rounded pebbles of trap, almost invariably of the variety known as amygdaloid, derived probably from the contemporaneous lavas, and rounded fragments of a jaspery rock which may have been a metamorphosed sandstone, the whole cemented by a dark-red iron sand. This cement may be regarded as a mixture of vol canic ash and arenaceous particles, the latter having been derived from the sandstone then in the progress of accumulation. It is not unusual \u25a0to meet with strata composed entirely of arenaceous particles associated with the conglomerate beds; and where these expand to a considerable thickness, the associated sandstone appears in alternating bands of white and red, and exhibits few traces of metaniprphismj but where the belts of sedimentary rock are thin, and come in contact with the trappean rocks, the sandstone is converted into a jaspery rock, traversed by divi sional planes, and breaking with a conchoidal fracture The trappean pebbles often attain a magnitude of eighteen inches in diameter. Their surfaces do not present that smooth, polished appearance which results from the attrition of water; in fact, a close observer can readily distinguish between those which have been recently detatched from the rock and those which have been for a time exposed to the recent action of the surf. The conglomerate appears to have been formed too rapidly to suppose that the masses were detached and rounded by the action of waves and currents, and deposited with silt and sand on the floor of the ancient ocean; for, while the contemporaneous sandstone remote from the line of"], [116, "100 Doc. No. 69. volcanic foci does not exceed three hundred or four hundred feet in thick ness, the united thickness of the conglomerate bands in the vicinity of the trappean range on Keweenaw Point exceeds five thousand feet. As we recede for a few miles from the line of the volcanic fissure, these amygdaloid pebbles disappear, and are replaced by arenaceous and argilla ceous particles. We are., therefore, disposed to adopt the theory, as to the origin of such masses, first suggested by Von Buch:* \"When basaltic islands and trachytic rocks rise on fissures, friction of the elevated rock against the walls of the fissures causes the elevated rock to be enclosed by conglomerates composed of its own matter. The granules compo sing the sandstones of many formations have been separated rather by friction against the erupted volcanic rock than destroyed by the erosive force of a neighboring sea. The existence of these friction conglomerates, which are met with in enormous masses in both hemispheres, testifies the intensity of the force with which the erupted rocks have been pro pelled from the interior through the earth's crust. The detritus has sud denly been taken up by the waters, which have then deposited it in tlje strata which it still covers.\" Those pebbles having a highly vesicular structure may have been ejected through the fissures, in the fonn of scori\u00e6, while in a plastic state, and have received their rounded shape from having been projected through water \u2014 on the same principle as melted le|d, when dropped from an elevation, assumes a globular form.f In the jaspery fragments included in the conglomerate, we often observe a structure analogous to the woody fibre of trees. These fragments (plate, fig. 2) are composed of lamin\u00e6, more or less contorted, and furrowed longi tudinally, like the markings in the extinct plants of the genus sigillaria. A series of stri\u00e6, as fine as the engraver's lines, run parallel with the larger ones. These can be traced on some of the specimens, and generally extend through the different folds; while others possess a structure like the cellular tissue ef wood. We have no confidence in the vegetable origin of these markings; nor have we any theory to offer in explanation. While there are no beds of calcareous rocks associated with this group, we have evidence that the waters during this epoch were abundantly charged with lime; for we find this substance, in the form of calc-spar, fill ing the vesicles of the amygdaloid and the fissures and pores in the con glomerate. It did not result,from deposition, but appears to have been forced into the interstices while in a heated condition, and perhaps in a state of gaseous sublimation. We know that modern volcanoes evolve vast quantities of gases which are capable of dissolving various earthy substances; and is it not reason able to suppose that the same phenomena were exhibited in the early history of our planet, and on a grander scale, when the communications with the interior were more numerous and extended, and when the recur rence of earthquake shocks and volcanic eruptions was more frequent *Geognost. Briefe, s. 75\u201482. \u25a0fThe extinct volcanoes of Auvergne afford numerous specimens cf volcanic bombs, which ap pear to have been ejected in a soft state, and, on cooling'in the air, assumed the form of drops or elongated spheroids."], [117, ""], [118, "\"\u25a0' \u25a0 \" \u2014 \u00bb\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0 \u00bb*> PlateV HORSE-SHOE, HARBOR L.S"], [119, "Doc. No. 69. 10L We ought, therefore, a, priori, to expect to find the products of these gaseous emanations in the vicinity of the volcanic foci. Range and extent \u2014 mineral contents. \u2014 In describing the trappean rocks, we necessarily spoke of the associated bands of conglomerate, and the influence they exerted on the productiveness of veins. We deem it unnecessary to enumerate all of the bands, inasmuch as they are indicated on the accompanying maps. They are lentiform masses, variable in number and thickness. On Keweenaw Point they are numerous, and possess much regularity, ran ging with the trap, and dipping to the N. and NW. at angles varying from 20\u00b0 to 50\u00b0. In the Ontonagon district they are less numerous, but near the Montreal river they expand to an enormous thiekness. On Isle Royale they occur under similar conditions with those observed on Keweenaw Point, with this exception, that the dip is reversed \u2014 vary ing from 2CT to 40'-' to the SE. and SSE. Manitou island is composed of conglomerate, except a few jutting points on the southern coast, which belong to the northern band of trap. Cross ing the channel, which is about three miles in width, we meet with this belt on the northeastern extremity of Keweenaw Point, and thence it is protracted west for about sixteen miles, when it becomes lost in the lake. For a greater portion of this distance it serves as a sea-wall ; but in a few places the water has broken through and excavated long and narrow harbors in this more yielding trap. The appended sketch of Horse shoe Harbor will serve to convey an idea of the appearance of this rock. It occurs in long lines, with rounded contours, and is traversed by heavy fissures, filled with calc-spar. A short distance west of Horse-shoe Harbor a spar vein intersects the shore, which in places is nine feet in width, and bears N. 5\u00b0 E. It affords an excellent material for lime, and has been calcined lor that purpose. On this a shaft was sunk near the junction of the trap and congl\u00abmerate, but no indications of copper were disclosed . On Hays's Point another spar vein, four feet in thickness, and bearing ,N. 9\u00b0 E., is seen. The matrix is more or sess colored with green and blue silicate of copper, forming the \"green rock\" of the old voyageurs. Several shafts were sunk upon it in the early days of copper-mining, but the ore was too meagre to be profitable. This vein undoubtedly extends through the intervening trap, and is developed in the second belt of con glomerate near Fort Wilkins, forming what is known as the Black Oxide Vein. The junction between the trap and conglomerate is well displayed in the vicinity of Copper Harbor. The rocks bear nearly due west, with a northerly dip of 35\u00b0. The trap on the upper surface resembles pumice, the vesicles frequently empty, but oftener filled witlj calc-spar, agates, chlorite, <fcc. Other portions are wrinkled, as though arrested whife flow ing. The lower portion of the conglomerate does not exhibit a clear and well-defined line of demarcation, but encloses angular masses of amygda loid, as though the materials had been thrown down while the trap was in a viscid state. This appearance was particularly noticed a few hun dred yards above Porter's island, where the pebbles, for the distance of twenty feet perpendicular, are enclosed in a scoriaceous mass. Between Copper Harbor and Agate Harbor numerous veins, cutting the formation at nearly right angles, are observed. The matrix for the"], [120, "102 Doc. No. 69. most part consists of calc-spar, but occasionally sulphate of baryta is present. Many of them have been explored, and from one, on the south west quarter of section 28, township 59, range 29, a mass of native cop per weighing about 600 lbs. was taken. At Agate Harbor the New York and Lake Superior Company sank two shafts to the respective depths of 70 and 90 feet, and nearly completed the communication between them by a gallery. The matrix of the vein consisted of calc-spar and sulphate of baryta, with black sulphuret of copper, but not in- sufficient abundance to authorize further operations. This belt forms the outer reef at Agate' Harbor, and does not again approach the shore. Another belt of conglomerate starts from the extremity of Keweenaw Point, opposite Manitou island, and conforms in direction to the one last described, from which it is separated by a sheet of igneous rock about 1,800 feet in thickness. This is known as the main conglomerate range. In places it rises lo the height of 650 feet, and expands to a thickness of 4,000 feet. The culminating points in the range are back of Horse-shoe Harbor and Grand Marais. It intersects the coast at Sand bay, and pre scribes its form as far as the Lake-shore location, section 33, township 58, range 32, when it bends inland and is prolonged towards Portage lake in a narrow band, which is obscurely traced. It does not differ in litho logical character from the belt previously described. The appended sketch, taken from Fort Wilkins, looking eastward, will convey a correct idea of the contour of the hills. The gentle slope towards the lake corresponds very nearly with the line of inclination, while the precipitous escarpments on the south may have resulted from powerful fissures, which destroyed the continuity of the strata. This belt, like the former one, contains numerous traces of copper. In preparing the ground where Fort Wilkins now stands, the soldiers came across numerous boulders of black oxide of copper, varying in weight froffl an ounce to several hundred pounds. Subsequently a vein was dicovered a few rods east of the fort, from fifteen to twenty inches in width, bearing N. 7\u00b0 E., and corresponding very nearly in direction and position to that before described as occurring in the northern belt orl Hays's Point. The gangue consisted of calc-spar, analcime, laumonite, and occasional crystals of fluor-spar, associated with which were the green and blue silicates and the black oxide of copper. This tract had been located by the Pittsburg and Boston Company, and was the first location made after the extinguishment of the Indian title in 1843. They may,. therefore, be regarded as the pioneers in mining enterprise. A part of their mining force was directed to the exploration of this vein. It was found, near the surface, to consist of the black oxide of copper of surpassing richness, yielding from 60 to 70 per cent. Two shafts were sunk Hbout 100 feet apart, and the black oxide found in both, but, at the depth of fifteen feet, it became exhausted. The fissure and veinstone continued, which induced the company, to prosecute further workings, in the hope that the mineral would reappear. Accordingly, the main shalt was extended to the depth of 120 feet, and levels driven in either direction, on the course of the vein, until it became manifest that it was unwise to proceed further.* The aggregate expenditures at this * Report of the trustees, (1849.)"], [121, "Doc.

At Eagle Harbor a narrow vein of black sulphuret of copper was ex plored to some extent. fF \" . Thin veins of this ore were also observed on the Hitz location, a few miles above the mouth of Eagle river, by the lake shore. In this range of conglomerate, a few rods from the outlet of Manganese lake, (section 5, township 58, range 2S,) occurs a vein of black ox.de of manganese associated with calc-spar. The vein is about 3 feet wide 15 inches of which is occupied by the ore. It is so highly sfficious as to impart is value for working.

The shaded portions are man ganese ; the light, calc-spar. The inclination is so great that it soon passes beneath the surface. Between Portage lake and the Ontanagon river, the conglomerate does not expand to the enormous thickness observed on Ke weenaw Point. Limited belts are occa sionally seen, but cannot be traced contin uously for any considerable distance. We observed quite a mass flanking the trap on sec tion 14, township 51, range 38, bearing north '8\u00b0 east, and dipping north' 50\u00b0. A belt, which continues for some miles, is observed south of the Algonquin and Douglass Houghton Com pany's works, and another occupies the northern flank of the trap in the vicinity of the Ontonagon river, and can be traced for many miles on either side. Lenticular beds are also of frequent occurrence in the trappean rocks, some of which attain a thickness of one hundred feet. Examples of this kind are seen at the Minnesota works, and \u25a0 to the east and west of the river. At the base of the Porcupine mountains, the conglomerate and associ ated sandstone expand to a great thickness, and, in the character of the pebbles, afford evidence of having been made up of the ruins of the ad jacent igneous rocks. Numerous intercalations of this rock are observed in the trap, differing in no respects from those described as occurring on Keweenaw Point. In following up the Presqu'isle river, the black slaty sandstone is ob served to be replaced by conglomerate, expanding to a thickness of several hundred feet. To this succeeds the bedded trap, followed by other bands of conglomerate. In the region of the Montreal river, however, the conglomerate expands to a great width, attaining a thickness of nearly 2,000 feet. The boul ders are, in some cases, fully three feet in diameter, consisting mostly of porphyritic trappean rocks and hornblende, cemented by acalcareous paste. This conglomerate bed rises, at its highest point 536 feet. The annexed is a section of the rocks from the mouth of Montreal river across to the trappean rocks, a distance of about three miles. There are several alternations here of amygdaloidal trap and sandstone. The latter"], [122, "104 Doc. No. 69. is generally shaly, and soon crumbles by the influence of atmospheric agen cies. These alternations are finely exposed in the bed of the river, which has cut a deep gorge for some distance nearly parallel with the course of the beds. The falls of this river, which have been before noticed, are caused by the unequal wearing of the beds of trap and sandstone, and are highly picturesque. The width of the intercalated beds of shaly sandstone varies from fifteen to nearly one hundred feet. They alternate with beds of trap of nearly equal thickness. The depth of the gorge varies from one hundred to one hundred and fifty feet. ."], [123, "Fig. 13."], [124, ""], [125, "Doc. No. 69. 107 An attempt at mining was made in the conglomerate on section 18, township 50, range 40, a few miles west of the Ontonagon, by the Men denhall Mining Company; and we are informed that not less than $10,000 were expended on the undertaking. At the time of our visit, it was abandoned. Several shafts, one of which reached to the depth of 1 00 feet, had been sunk, and galleries run from one to the other; the whole of which were filled with water. The bearing of the vein is north 17\u00b0 west and may be observed cropping out in the bed of a small stream called Mineral creek, which crosses the location. The gangue is calcareous spar and sul phate of baryta, in which the gray sulphuret of copper otcurs in very variable quantities, intermixed with silica. The vein varies in width; sometimes it is split into numerous threads, and again it disappears alto gether. Some of the specimens of solid ore were from four to five inches in width, and we were informed that but a few barrels of this had been ob tained. That lying about the shafts was very meagre, being mostly spar, mixed with conglomerate, and containing a small per centage of copper. We were informed that the deepest shaft had been carried down belpw where the ore was found in the vein. Here the vein pitched to the west, with a gradually increased angle, and was underlaid by sandstone. Pro ceeding southwardly, it became poorer, and the shaft sunk a few rods south of the main one, after having reached a few feet, was in barren rock. The veinstone was, at this point, composed of a curious mixture of imperfect agate and calc-spar, in alteied sandstone. Efforts were made to trace the vein into the trap, which is contiguous, but without success. Both carbonate of lime and sulphate of baryta are here found in finely crystallized specimens. The former occurs in hemitropic crystals of con siderable interest to the crystaliographer. They are a combination of the scalene triangular dodecahedron, of a form hitherto found at only one locality in Siberia; also, in six-sided prisms. Some of the varieties of agate were very beautiful, and it is to be regretted that good suites could not have been secured for the government collection. The mining operations here have thrown considerable light on the oc currence of copper in the detrital rocks, and demonstrated that these veins are not reliable ones. We have, in another chapter, described the numerous alternations of trap and conglomerate which occur along the northern slope of the trap pean range. Along the southern slope these belts are very rare. Where the Bohemian range breaks through the incumbent rocks at Lac la Belle, a thin band of conglomerate, not exceeding 30 feet in thickness, is ob served, which has been traced, at intervals, for two or three miles. Its inclination is 80p to the south and southeast. Regarding these conglom erates, lying north of the anticlinal axis, as composed, in the main, of igneous products, and the sandstones, on the south, as purely detrital ac cumulations, we are led to infer that, while the region north of the anti clinal axis was subject to a series of volcanic outbreaks, that to the south remained comparatively tranquil. Divisional planes . \u2014 The conglomerate rocks \u2014 and the same remarks are applicable to the sandstones \u2014 are traversed by different systems of divis ional planes, which are found to preserve a remarkable degree of uni formity, giving to the mass a crystalliform appearance. They pursue straight lines, without any deviation, and extend, to unknown depths; and so sudden was the shock by which these fissures were formed, that the"], [126, "108 Doc. No. 69. intervening pebbles are cut in twain. The main fissures pursue a course varying but a few degrees from the true magnetic meridian, which is found to be the case in other countries. The rocks traversed by these fissures often exhibit not only a vertical, but horizontal dislocation. To convey an, idea of their direction and uniformity, we submit the following observations taken with great care by Mr. Hill: MUN FISSURES, Commencing at the western extremity of the point north of Agate Harbor, and thence running east.

Several of the blocks formed by the lines of division were measured. The following figures represent their forms : Fig. u. At Siskawit bay, Isle Royale, two sets of fissures were observed in the sandstone \u2014 one bearing south and southeast, the other south 40\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 west. A further detail of observations on this head is deemed unnecessary, as they all go to prove the general principles before announced. Although the conglomerate attains a thickness of five thousand feet, yet it by no means follows that the ancient sea in which it was deposited extend ed to that depth. Ripple-marks and clay-cracks have been observed in the upper portions of this group; the one indicates comparatively shoal water,* and the other the ebbing and flowing of a tide, or a change in the level of the water. The inference, therefore, is, that during the deposition of the conglom erate, the bed of the sea was subject to repeated elevations and depres sions, caused by volcanic action, and that its waters obeyed the same tidal laws which govern the existing oceans. These conglomerates, then, may be regarded as local deposites, formed along the courses of the volcanic fissures by the joint agency of fire and water. When the former causes operated with intensity, the materials consisted of spherical masses of lava and scori\u00e6. When they acted feebly, or were quiescent, the materials became argillaceous or arenaceous. Sandstone. \u2014 It is not our purpose in this report to set forth the boun daries of the sandstone, much less to describe its characters, where it comes in contact with the pre-existing rocks. These descriptions will be reserved for the general report on the pal\u00e6ozoic rocks of this district. We propose simply, at this time, to show its connexion with the cupriferous rocks before described. In order that this connexion may be better un derstood, we introduce the following diagram: \u00ab. a Crystalline trap. b. b. Bedded trap. c. c. Conglomerate. </. d.

Stevenson, however, asserts that the agilaiionsof the sea reach tj the depth ostwj hundred feet."], [128, "110 Doc. No. 69. We have seen that, during the deposition of the sandstone, numerous sheets of trap were ejected, and flowed like lava-streams; and that the igneous and aqueous products were so intermingled as to present the ap- pearance of having been derived from a common origin; and that subse- quently the unbedded trap broke through these parallel fissures, lifting up the sandstones, conglomerates, and bedded traps, and causing the whole mass to dip at high angles. -Thus, this portion of the bed of Lake Su- perior is due to these two lines of upheaval. The sandstone between the two lines performs an immense curve, portions of which are at least 800 feet below the chord formed by the surface of the water. The sand- stone is seen on Isle Royale, forming the outer reefs of Siskawit bay. It is of a dark -red color, somewhat fissile, and traversed by numerous divis- ional planes. Thin beds of conglomerate, composed of trappean pebbles, are seen, the whole dipping to the southeast about 8\u00b0. This is not a purely silicious rock, but takes into its composition argillaceous particles, with an admixture of oxide of iron. Passing over to the southern shore, the sandstone is first seen on Keweenaw Point, in low reefs, near the Lake-shore location, (section 1, township 57, range 33,) beyond which point, proceeding eastward., it is succeeded by the conglomerate, which rests beneath it. Proceeding westerly, the trap recedes from the shore, and the intervening space is occupied by the sandstone, forming a belt about ten miles in width. About a mile above the Portage, a good opportunity is afforded for ex amination. Here commence a series of bold cliffs, which line the coast for several miles. They are composed of strata of unequal thickness and induration. Some of the strata consist of'silex, with thin plates of mica interspersed, while others contain portions of alumine, colored red by oxide of iron. The silicious strata afford excellent building materi als, and the supply is inexhaustible. Slabs varying from two inches to two feet in thickness, and exposing perfectly level surfaces of forty or fifty superficial feet, can readily be procured. The rock is sufficiently indurated to give it strength, and is little affected by atmospheric agents. The water is of sufficient depth to permit vessels to approach within a few rods of the shore. The unequal resistance which the strata oppose to the action of the surf has caused the cliffs to assume various fantastic shapes. The harder beds project like cornices, and can be traced almost as far the eye can reach. In the softer materials, the waves have scooped out numerous caverns, resembling gothic doorways. The nearly horizontal stratifica tion of the rocks, their brick-red color, with occasional bands of a lighter tint, and the numerous vertical fissures by which they are intersected, cause them to resemble immense walls of masonry piled up by the hand of man. These cliffs do not range in continuous lines, but exhibit numerous projections and recessions. Peaks shoot up above the mass, like towers, connected by walls, which at the base are excavated into arches and gate ways. The whole is crowned by a dense mass of foliage of the birch, the mountain a:-h, the fir, and the spruce. Fro\"m this mass issue numer ous fountains, which precipitate themselves for fifty or sixty feet before they mingle with the lake. These cliff's may be regarded as a miniature representation of the Pictured Rocks. As we recede from the trap, the dip of the sandstone diminishes rap-"], [129, "Doc. No. 69. 111 idly, and, at the distance of a few miles, the stratification becomes hori zontal. The following observations are adduced: Section 11 Township 57 Range 33 Bearing N. 30\u00b0 E.

Its junction with the trap on the north is rarely seen, in consequence of the drift which reposes on it. It nowhere rises into ridges, but slopes gradually from the trappean chain, and appears to have remained undisturbed since the upheaval of the trap, if we ex cept that general elevatory movement by which the whole district has been raised above the ocean-level. By the lake shore, (section 33, township 57, range 33,) a singular bed of sandstone is exposed for a distance of eighty rods; and the same has been recognised inJand. It is composed of sub-crystalline particles of quartz and feldspar, but the original granular structure,, on close inspec tion, can be recognised. Its bearing and inclination are conformable to the adjacent beds, being north 22J\u00b0 east, dip 26\u00b0 north-northwest. From the Portage to the Montreal river, the sandstone is exposed along the lake shore at short intervals. The further it is observed from the trappean rocks, not only does its inclination become less, but the strata are less colored, and the cohesion between the particles is slighter. Between Salmon Trout and Misery rivers the inclination is very slight, not exceeding 5\u00b0 to the northwest. The trap range between these two rivers is about six miles inland, and consists of low dome-shaped knobs. To the west it is more prominently developed, and the sandstone in the vicinity acquires a sharper dip, which gradually increases until, at the base of the Porcupine mountains, where the trap approaches within a mile of the lake shore, rising up in a lofty ridge more than a thousand feet in height, the sandstone is tilted up at an angle-of 30\u00b0 or 403. The intercalated beds in this vicinity are found to present a nearly uniform dip, showing that their elevation is due to a single upheaval. At Iron river, and at several other points, the sandstone is very fissile and of a dark-brown color, resembling a slaty rock. This rock is ob served to dip in'a direction different from the general dip of the sand stone which lines the coast. This diversity nas been occasioned by the upheaval of the Porcupine mountains, whose prolongation is at nearly right angles with the general direction of the trap range. The bearing of the sandstone exposed in the bed of the stream varies from north and south to north 40\u00b0 east and south 40\u00b0 west. The Presqu'isle river, a short distance above its mouth, is precipitated 40 feet over the dark-colored slaty sandstone, It here dips 10\u00b0 north wardly, the bearing being south 61\u00b0 west. About one-half of a mile from its junction with the trap, it bears north 8\u00b0 west, and dips north northwest 30\u00b0. At the mouth of Black river the same form of sandstone appears, and may be regarded as an accidental variety of the rock which lines nearly the entire coast. Advancing along the coast towards the Montreal river, the inclina- \u25a0"], [130, "112 Doc. No. 69. tion of the sandstone gradually increases, and at the latter point it is ob served in a nearly vertical position. It is here about two miles removed from the trap, and has the same inclination as at the point of contact. These dips have been taken on the northern ,slope of the trap range by the lake shore, or in the beds of streams where there was a good expo sure.of the rock. South of the trap range, the sandstone is almost in variably horizontally stratified, except in the immediate vicinity of the trap, where, for the most part, it dips at a high angle to the south. Judge Burt, however, found the sandstone south of Porcupine mountains dip ping to the north. The general relations of the sandstone and trap will be better understood by referring to the subjoined section from Lake Superior, in township 51, range 43, to the Ontonagon river, in township 49, range 41. \u2014 (see opposite page.) Passing over the trappean ranges, we find the sandstone occupying the southern slope, and bearing the same relation to the trap as the northern belt, with this exception, that the intervening masses of conglomerate are, in the main, wanting. On the south side of Keweenaw Point, (section 27, township 58, range 28,) above Bete Gris bay, the sandstone is seen bearing north 22p east, and dipping southeast, or away from the trap, at an angle of 78\u00b0, and can be traced along the lake shore for three-fourths of a mile. It is nearly white in color, composed almost entirely of sili cious particles, and would form an excellent firestone. On section 36, township 58, range 29, it is again exposed, flanking a thin band of conglomerate. It here consists of alternating bands of a white and red color, having a high inclination. In the bottom of the .bay, when the lake is tranquil, these bands can be seen describing immense curves, conforming in direction to the course of the Bohemian range. This is a point of much interest, as it enables us to solve the problem of the relative ages of the unbedded and sheet trap, and of the associated sand stone and conglomerate. Their order of succession is here distinctly traced. On the east side of section 14, township 57, range 29, the sandstone is observed in low ledges, forming the southern coast of Bete Gris bay. Although but a few miles removed from the igneous rocks, it reposes in a nearly horizontal position. The rock is very fissile, of a deep-red color, and contains patches of dove-colored clay and ochre, or hydrous peroxide of iron. There arc also numerous concretions, resembling, a$ first sight, the vertebr\u00e6 or joints of crinoids, the mould being filled with pure white silex, while in the centre it is not unusual to see a dark speck correspond ing with the alimentary cavity or internal canal. These concretions are so curious that we append a figure. Cutting through one of them at right angles with the planes of stratification, it is found to be a sphere or ball"], [131, "Fig. 16. 3"], [132, ""], [133, "Doc. No. 69. 115 enveloping the black speck which served as a nucleus. This peculiarity in the sandstone has been noticed at frequent intervals as far east as the Pictured Rocks, and even at the outlet of the lake, though at the latter place less perfectly developed. At Tobacco river the sandstone is finely displayed in alternating bands of white and red, forming cliffs fifty or sixty feet in height. Just btffore its entrance into the lake, the stream is precipitated over a ledge of this rock from a height often feet. The aboriginal name of the river is Wa sakodew<tbikag-sepi, or Burnt Stone river, from the prevailing tint of the rock. The present name applies to the dark color of the water furnished by the cedar swamps winch skirt the base of the Bohemian mountains. Along the shore the sandstone is beautifully variegated \u2014 parallel bands of a flesh -red color crossing the mass without reference to stratification, and forming a striking contrast with the buff color which constitutes the prevailing tint. (Plate XII, fig. 1, retro.) Proceeding up Keweenaw bay, we find the sandstone lining the sli i es in bold cliffs, with occasional entering bays; but there are places wher il or miles it is impossible to find a boat-harbor. The stratification is hori< m- tal, or rather consists of numerous.gentle undulations. The waves have excavated caverns in the cliffs, and fashioned them into many grotesque forms. The prevailing dip of the sandstone, we inferred, was about 5\u00b0 to the northwest. At one or two points we noticed that the strata had un- dergone slight vertical dislocations. As we approach L'Anse, the clip to the northwest becomes apparent, and a change in the external characters is noted. The grains become coarser, aud pebbles of white quartz are dis- seminated through the mass. We rarely meet with a pebble of green- stone or amygdaloid. At Crebbesa's (section 25, township 51, range 33) it bears northeast, with a very perceptible dip to the northwest. We have thus traced il to the limits of the metamorphic rocks. To describe its relations to this system, although it forms one of the most in- teresting features in the geology of the region, does not come wiihin the purview of this report. The Sturgeon river was explored by Mr. Hill. For twenty miles no rock was exposed in place, and its banks are bordered with stratified deposites of clay, sand, and gravel. On section 8, township 51, range 34, angular Mocks of sandstone are observed, and in the southwest quarter of the sec- lion the white and red variety is exposed in the bed of a small stream. It is extremely friable, and in other respects resembles that which is ex- posed at the White rapids on the Menomonee river, south of the great anticlinal axis between the waters of Michigan and Superior. Near the south boundary of township 51, range 34, the river flows over a rocky bottom composed of sandstone, dipping northwest from 2\u00b0 to 2^\u00b0. The rapids continue for three miles over this rock. The local disturb ances in this vicinity by reason of the proximity of the igneous rocks have been elsewhere described. The sandstone rarely emerges to the surface, but is covered with heavy accumulations of clay. The Sturgean river at the time of our ascent was at high flood, a condition by no means favora ble to geological explorations. On Torch river the sandstone is exposed in the bed of the stream for the distanced more than a mile. It consists of yellow or red grains, with out any visible cement, enclosing quartzose pebbles and patches of dove colored clay similar to that which occurs at Bete Gris bay."], [134, "116 Doc. No. 69. As this sandstone possesses no economical value, it is deemed unnecessary to incorporate further local details. Its boundaries are defined, to the best of our information, on the accompanying maps. The sandstone extends uninterruptedly from Bete Gris bay to Black river, a distance of 120 miles. On the west and north it is bounded by the trap pean ranges, and on the south by the granite and metamorphic rocks. On Keweenaw Point it is about ten miles in width, but between the head of the bay and Agogebic lake it expands to twice that width. It forms a longitudi nal valley, through which sweep the Sturgeon\u201ethe Ontonagon, and Black rivers, in a transverse direction. The general appearance of this valley is that of a nearly level plain, covered to a great depth by stratified deposites of reddish-colored clay, in which the streams have excavated deep and narrow ravines. It is thickly wooded, and the soil well adapted to agri cultural purposes. This sandstone has been examined from Fond du Lac to Grand Sable, a distance of more than 300 miles. While the beds, in the main, have been so little changed in the process of consolidation as to preserve on their surfaces the forms of ripple-marks and clay-cracks as perfectly as we behold them at this day on the borders of the lake, and while even the indentations of the rain-drops which pattered upon that ancient shore are well preserved, we search in vain for any traces of animal or vegetable life which flourished during this epoch.* From their entire absence we are led to infer that, during the deposition of the sandstone, the waters of the sea, either from their high temperature or. by reason of their impreg nation with noxious gases, or both causes combined, were rendered inca pable of sustaining vegetable or animal life. We have adduced abundant evidence to show that during this epoch the igneous causes were in a state of intense activity \u2014 that numerous lava currents issued from the volcanic fissures, and flowed among the silts and sediments of the ancient sea. Modern volcanoes emit carbonic acid gas, sulphuretted hydrogen and muriatic acid. These products must have been evolved much more copiously during this epoch, when the exterior surface of the earth communicated with the interior by numerous and far reaching fissures, at that time unfilled. Humboldt supposes that the abundance of limestone which charac terizes tlie Silurian epoch resulted from the decreasing heat of the superfi cial waters, allowing them to absorb carbonic acid from the air, at that time overcharged with that element. Before the sandstone was entirely deposited, the igneous causes had almost ceased to operate. We may suppose that, as the waters parted with their heat, the limestone absorbed carbonic acid, and was thrown down as a precipitate on the floor of the ocean. In these precipitates, forming the lower magnesian limestone, we detect in the rocks of this region the first traces of organic life. The position of this member of the series, and the entombed remains, we shall now pro ceed to describe. *We might perhaps except ths obscure traces of fucoids described by Dr. Locke as occurring at the Pictured Rocks. One' or two specimens of linguloz have been found in Tequamenen bay ; and on the St. Croix, according to Dr. Owen, where the evidences of volcanic paroxysms are less marked, the sandstone ia highly fossiliferous."], [135, "Doc. No. 69. 117 COMPACT, OR LOWER MAGNESIAN LIMESTONE. The sandstone, as we ascend from the lower strata to the higher, is found to be less colored by the oxides of iron, and to take into its com position particles of lime, until finally it passes into well-characterized, compact, magnesian limestone. The upper portions of the sandstone effervesce with acids, where a granular structure only is recognisable by the eye. We apply the term magnesian to this belt to define its litho logical characters, although the associated organic remains would seem to indicate the presence of several of the lower Silurian groups, which cannot be recognised by lithological differences. The whole of the northern slope of the anticlinal axis bears evident marks of having been subjected to extensive denudation; and hence over the greater portion of this region we look in vain for traces of limestone rocks. If they existed, they have been swept away; and wherever we penetrate through the thick deposite of clay and sand, we find the rock in place to be sandstone. A limited patch of limestone, however, yet remains west of L'Anse, forming the highest elevation in that direction till we reach the trap range. It is in township 51, range 35, and occupies a portion of four sections. It was first ,discovered by Mr. C. C. Doug lass, in the summer of 1846, but nothing farther was known until the township was subdivided in 1S4S, when its extent and exact locality were determined. Near the quarter-post, between sections 13 and 14, township 51, range 35, the limestone is seen in place, forming a bluff, about 50 feet above a small stream at its base. Here the strata are nearly horizontal, though large blocks have slidden down the side of the hill, and thus appear to dip towards the east. The limestone rests upon a white sandstone, which belongs to the upper part of the formation which we have described as underlying the whole of this valley. A little to the west of the line, between sections 23 and 24, and ex- tending for a little more than a mile, the limestone is seen in a high cliff which runs south and gradually bends t\u00bb the eastward, crossing the line, in several ridges, near the southern limit of these sections, whei! it dis- appears beneath the drift materials. Ledges of rock are occasionally ex- posed, from 20 to 50 feet in thickness. The height of the bluff above the surrounding country is fully 200 feet; and about 600 feet above Lake Superior. The limestone is distinctly stratified, in layers from an inch to a foot in thickness, which dip, according to measurements taken along the lower edge of the precipitous portion, from 25\u00b0 to 30\u00b0; and the direction of the dip is always to the eastward, varying at different points from N. 50\u00b0 E. to S. 20\u00b0 E. It is of a buff color \u2014 in some places silicious, with quartzose nodules; but in others, highly magnesian', containing about 45 per cent, of carbonate of magnesia. From the horizontality of the first described deposite, .which occurs about a quarter of a mile to the north, it seems evident that the lime- stone overlies the sandstone, although the position of the inclined beds of the more southerly portion of the limestone is at first diffieult to explain, since the surrounding country is low and level, and under- laid by sandstone in horizontal beds. It seems evident that at this"], [136, "118 Doc. No. 69. point the country has been disturbed and upheaved by igneous action beneath, which has raised the strata, without any appearance of trappean rocks on the surface. This view of the case is corroborated by the fact that at no great distance from this point an elevation occurs from which the strata of sandstone dip on all sides, and although there is no igneous rock visible, yet it is evident that the sandstone has been raised in a dome-like protuberance by a mass of igneous rock pressing upon it from below. The same cause is also indicated by the irregular variation of the magnetic needle in the vicinity observed by the linear surveyors, which is unusual except fallen caused by the proximity of the trappean rocks. The isolated knob of trap called Silver mountain, which has been be fore described, is an example in point \u2014 where, however, the elevating force has not only been sufficient to raise and shatter the strata of sand stone, but, at the same time, to protrude a mass of molten igneous matter above the surface. Geological position. \u2014 As to the geological position of this limestone, there can be little doubt that it is superior to the sandstone. Mr. Whitney and Mr. Hill have both explored it with care, and both have arrived at the same conclusion. The sandstone, wherever observed in this re gion, rests unconformably on the argillaceous schists. It is seen in this position ten miles east of this deposite, and is found in the beds of the streams in this vicinity. On the southern side of the axis, Messrs. Fos ter and Hill found these two groups occupying the same relative position. Organic remains. \u2014 The fossil restrains entombed in this deposite are by no means abundant, and are so imperfect, consisting for the most part of casts, that it is impossible, to identify species. We have submitted such as were collected by us to Mr. James Hall, the accomplished pal\u00e6 ontologist of the New York survey, and herewith append his report: \"I have examined the fossils submitted to me from the limestone west of Keweenaw bay. The specimens, unfortunately, are all in the condi tion of casts of the interior, and therefore the evidence is less satisfactory than if the shells had been preserved. The evidence from the whole together goes to prove that the rocks from which they were obtained be long to the older Silurian period. \" This evidence 1 will give in detail, so that you may judge of its value, as well as myself; and you may give what weight you think proper to it in your generalizations. \"One of the most conspicuous fossils (No. 1) is a species of maclurea, not unlike the species from the Chazy limestone. All the species of this genus yet known have been found in the rocks of the lower Silurian pe riod; and although many hundreds of gasteropodous molluscs are known in the higher rocks, there is not one of this genus, nor any form ap proaching it. 1 feel inclined, therefore, to regard this genus as a lower Silurian type. \"No. 2 is a fragment of a spiral gasteropod, either murchisonia or lox onema; the surface markings being obliterated, it is not easy to determine to which of these genera it belongs. Its association with maclurea is presumptive evidence that it is a murchisonia, the species of which in this country are restricted to the. lower Silurian rocks. \"Among the acephalous molluscs, the casts of a species of ambonychia (No. 3) are very conspicuous. The species are near A. orbkulata of the"], [137, "Doc. No. 69. 119 Trenton limestone, but are somewhat more elongated, and in this respect approach A. amygdalina. \"A considerable number of specimens are of species belonging to the genus modiolopsis, (No. 4,) among which are several bearing a close re semblance to M. truncatus. Other specimens (No. 5) bear a very close jesefnblance to edmondia subtruncata and E. subanzulata of the Trenton limestone, (Pal. N. Y., vol. 1, p. 156, pi. 35, figs. 2 and 3;) hut these specimens, which are casts, show a greater affinity to modiolopsis in hav ing the strong anterior muscular impression so characteristic of that genus. '\u2022'The specimens No. 6 are casts bearing a very close similarity to ed timtdia ventricosa. (Pal. N. Y., vol. 1, p. 155, pi. 35, fig. 1.) These specimens cannot but be regarded as identical or closely allied to the spe cies cited. \"The cast bears no strong anterior muscular impression, but the lamin\u00e6 between the beaks are impressed on both sides by prominent teeth, which -ftirEish sufficient marks to identify the species in this condition. \" No. 7 is another species of the same genus as the last, and is very closely allied, if not identical with a species from the Trenton limestone of Sev/ York. \".The leptan\u00e6 (No. S) have the characters of L. sericea, which in its highest range does not extend above the Clinton group of New York, aad is more characteristic of the limestone from the base of the Trenton upward to the top of the Hudson river group, or blue limestone of Ohio. \"The species of orthis (No. 9) is too obscure to be identified, but it pre sents the characters known to me only in the lower Silurian rocks. \"The crinoid joints on specimen No. 10 belong to the genus glypto *rinus. The species is not more recent than the Hudson river group. \" The fragments of orthoceratites are too obscure to form any reliable opin ions concerning them. The other fossils belong to bodies unknown to me at the present time.\" From all of the facts, these fossils may be regarded as belonging to the earlier type's of organic life. From the limited scale on which these de posites are developed, and the imperfect character of the organic remains, it is impossible to fix their precise equivalents in the New York classifica tion. The sandstones and limestones which we have described may be regarded as the equivalents of the Potsdam and Calciferous sand stones, the Chazy, Bird's-eye, and Black river limestones, and perhaps of the Trenton and even the Hudson river groups. We have designedly omitted many facts with regard to the pal\u00e6ozoic rocks of this region; but in a subsequent report we purpose to describe their range and extent, and also their fossil contents. In the execution of this task we shall be aided by Mr. James Hall, who has investigated tfae Silurian rocks more thoroughly perhaps than any other American ge ologist. RESUME. Having thus, in several of the preceding chapters, delineated the bound aries and described the lithological characters and mineral associations of She different systems of rocks embraced within the copper region, it will"], [138, "120 Doc. No. 69. not be deemed inappropriate to advert to the varying conditions of the earth during the period of their formation. We may suppose that at one time all of this district formed a part of the bed of the primeval ocean. Adopting the theory of a cooling globe, we may further suppose that the waters were in a heated 'condition, and differed essentially in chemical composition from those of the present oceans. The earth's crust was intersected by numerous, powerful fissures* and the communication between the exterior and interior was unob structed. Volcanic phenomena were much more frequent, and exerted on a grander scale. Each volcanic paroxysm would give rise to power ful currents and agitations of the water, and their abrading action in de taching portions of the pre existing rocks, and depositing them in beds and layers on the floor of the ocean, would operate with greater intensity than at the present time. We can trace the remains of one volcanic fis sure extending from the head of Keweenaw Point, in a southwesterly di rection, to the western limits of the district; and of another, in a parallel direction, from the head of Neepigon bay to the- western limits of Isle Royale. Along the lines of these fissures existed numerous volcanic vents, like those observed at this day in Peru, Guatemala, and Java, which were characterized by periods of activity- and repose. From these vents were poured forth numerous sheets of trap, which flowed over the sands and clays then in the.progress of accumulation. During the throes and convulsions of the mass, portions of rock would become detached, and rounded simply by the effects of attrition, and jets of melted matter be pro jected as volcanic bombs through the air or water, which, on cooling, would assume spheroidal forms ; while other portions of the rock, in a state of minute mechanical division, would fee ejected in the form of ashes and sand, which, mingling with the water, would be deposited, as the oscillations subsided, among the sands and pebbles at the bottom of the sea. During the whole of this period of volcanic activity, the sands which now form the base of the Silurian system were in the progress of accumulation, and became mingled with these igneous products. The level of the sea, as evidenced by the ripple-marks^ was subject to repeated alterations: some times it rose so shoal that the marks of the rippling waves were impressed on t^p sands; at others, it sank to unfathomable depths. In the process of consolidation, the rocks became traversed by numer ous fissures, and the water, charged with lime, was forced in like jets of steam, filling them with materials different from the enclosing mass. In this way the pores in the conglomerate and the vesicles of the amyg daloid were filled. Thus alterrating bands of igneous and aqueous rocks were formed,* until finally the great crystalline masses of greenstone were protruded through the fissures, not in a liquid,' but in a plastic state, lifting up the bedded trap and conglomerate, and causing them to dip at high angles from the axis of elevation. As the volcanic action diminished in energy, the detrital rocks enclosed fewer igneous products; and, when it ceased1 \u2022Consult, passim, De la Beche, (Survey of Cornwall,) Murchison, (Silurian System,) and Professor Edward Hitchcock, ( \u2014 vol. American Journal of Science,) as to the mod* of formation of the bedded trap. These belts have often been described as dikes, into which the molten matter has been injected along the lines of least resistance. If this were the case, we ought to find them, like the </ifcp of greenstone in the granite, cutting across the formation, for that would be the line of least re sistance, and penetrating the mass in numerous ramifying veins. We should expect to find tie"], [139, "Doc. No. 69. 121 altogether, sand and clay, derived from regions remote from the lines of disturbance, were the only materials which, for a time, were deposited on the floor of the ocean . To illustrate the nature of volcanic action, we need only to revert to instances which have happened within the present century.* So recently as 1831, a mass of rock rose up from the sea near the coast of Sicily, where soundings had previously been made to the depth of six hundred feet. This mass, which was subsequently known as Graham's island, rose gradually from the water, until it attained an elevation of two hun dred feet above the surface, and a circumference of three miles. It slowly diminished to the circumference of three hundred yards, and in the course of three months sank eleven feet below the water, leaving a dan gerous reef. i The formation of this island was attended with earthquakes and water spouts, and the effusion of vast quantities of steam and vapor. The sur rounding water was covered with scori\u00e6 and the bodies of fishes. Frag ments of rock were detached by the waves and currents, and deposited in the bottom of the sea. Now, if its bed were laid bare, it would probably be found to exhibit a section somewhat like the following : 1. A mass of volcanic rock, forming an axis or cone, crystalline or granu lar in proportion to the rapidity or slowness with which it parted with its heat, and the degree of pressure to which it had been subjected. '2. Volcanic breccia, consisting of fragments which had become detached and afterwards reunited with the fluid mass. 3. Coarse conglomerate, composed for the most part of pebbles derived from the upheaved mass. 4. Beds of arenaceous and calcareous particles, brought down by the rivers of the adjacent coast, and enveloping the remains of fishes, if not too perishable in their nature, and of shells, inhabiting the shrrounding sea. The conglomerates and trap tuffs would rapidly thin out as we receded from the volcanic focus, and be replaced by the silts and sediments de rived from the rivers flowing into the sea. Such, we conceive, was the process by which the rocks embraced in this report were formed. The heated condition of the fluids, as well as the gaseous exhalations constantly escaping through the open fissures, would prevent the development of animal and vegetable life. junction between the igneous and aqueous rocks clear and well defined, and no marked charac ter -t'cs between the upper and lower portions of the erupted matter. This, however, is far from being the case. The upper portion of the trap belts is highly ve sicular, resembling pumice. Frequently we find angular blocks of trap included in this paste, like ice which has been broken into fragments and aUerwards reunited. We find sandstone de posited in the fissures of the amygdaloid, and angular fragments of the latter included in the sandstone. Between the two rocks there is no well-defined line of junction. The sand and peb bles appear to have been thrown down while the latter rock was in a viscid state. On the other hand, where the trap is exposed reposing on the sandstone, the line of demarcation is clearly defined, the trap is less vesicular, and the sandstone more changed. These appearances clearly indicate to our minds that the bedded trap flowed like lava-streams among the sands while in the progress of accumulation, instead of having been injected in the form of dikes afier the con solidation of the strata had been effected. *This incident is cited by Murchison in his Silurian System, and applied in illustration of the formation of the bedded trap."], [140, "122 Doc. No. 69. When the igneous action became dormant, the water, having parted with a portion of its heat, would absorb carbonic acid from the atmo sphere, which, uniting with the lime held in solution, would be precipi tated in beds and layers at the bottom of the sea. This Humboldt con jectures to have been the origin of tlie vast deposites forming the Silu rian limestones. As the condition of the water changed, numerous types of animal life sprang into being, whose remains are so profusely scattered throughout the strata of that era. Note. \u2014 Since the foregoing chapter. was written we have examined Dana's Geology of the Exploring Expedition, aid find that his description of the volcanic belts of the Pacific islands corresponds in many respects with those of the region under consideration. Thus, Mani, one of the Sandwich islands, is composed of compact and cellular basalt, and compact clinkstone; but at the northeastern extremity there is a cliff of conglomerate 300 or 400 feet high In a pass through ihe mountains, Dr. Pickering observed it 2000 feet above the level of the so, consisting of half rounded fragments of volcanic rocks. \"On Oahu, the compact basaUic lava alternates at times with conglomerate and tufas. Many of the conglomerates are beds of rounded stones and gravel, of the same material as the moun- tains. Others are compacted beds of basa'tic earth, and have a tufa character. The material in many places consists of true volcanic secri\u00e6 and cinders; the former twisted and ropy, and the latter looking like cemented pitchstone, and the whole is so loosely aggregated as to crumble in the hands. The alternation of the solid and conglomerate layers may be seen at many places. The latter are very irregular; graduating frequently into the finer kinds, and forming irregular beds.\" In describing the geological features of Kawai, another of this group, he remarks: \"The con glomerates are very various in structure. Some are a coarse tula; others consist of large rounded masses \u2014 many thirty cubic feet in size, lying together, with earth and pebbles filling up the in- terstices. They contain all the rocks of the mountains, the most cellular, as well as the most compact. Near the descent into the Harapepe valley, not far from the bottom, there were masses of scori\u00e6 in the conglomerate, looking as if there had been ejections of scorice in the vicinity while the island structure was in progress, end before the superincumbent two hundred feet, of layers had been formed.\" Similar conglomerates occur at the Society islands, and the Samoan islands. \"At the Fejee islands the coarse conglomerates pass gradually into a basaltic sandstone, consisting of fine grains of a very uniform textur*. A still finer variety of compact structure resembles an argil laceous rock, and might be mistaken for it from hand specimens. * * * \"At the Mali cliffs the, conglomerate differs in hardness; but in most instances bears evidence of the action of heat in the firmness with which the fragments are cemented together They are sometimes found in close contact wilh the solid basalt, at first seeming to be i. \"bedded in it. At many localities the rock will as readily break acrosn the fragments of basalt as along the material which unites them. These rocks are generally stiatified; though the stratified structure is often more distinctly seen in the distant view than on the spot. In some instances it is minutfly dis tinct. The strata are generally horizontal, but along the shores it is not unusual to find a large inclination towards the sea. Some of the higher elevations of Vanua Lebu, (Fejee islands,) consist of these conglomerates. The little village of Mathuata is over-looked bv a srownine bluff 3,000 feet in height.\" ' 5"], [141, "Doc. No. 69. 123 CHAPTER IV. MINES AND MINING.

The exploitation of mines affords some of the most splendid examples of human contrivance and ingenuity. In extent these underground work ings surpass the proudest monuments of architecture, and, with their vari - ous shafts, adits, and galleries, constitute a labyrinth as inextricable as that of Crete. The largest architectural structures are erected to gratify the public taste, or commemorate some signal achievement in arts or in arms; but these subterranean structures exhibit proofs of elaborate and persevering effort scientifically directed to Avhat is practical and useful. To show the extent to which they have been carried, a few prominent examples will be cited. The engine-shaft of the United and Con solidated mines in Cornwall reaches to the depth of 1 ,650 feet ; and the length of the various shafts, adits, and galleries exceeds 63 miles. The great adit for the discharge of the waters of the Gwen nap mines, Cornwall, exceeds thirty miles.* The depth of the fa mous silver mine of Valenciana, Mexico, is 1,860 feet. The workings of the Samson mine at Andreasberg, in the Harz, have been prosecuted to the depth of 2,197 feet. The depth of the mines in the Saxon Erze birge, near Freiburg , are, in Thurmhofer mines 1,944 feet; in Honenbir ker mines 1,S27 feet. The depth of the celebrated mine of Joachimsthal, in Bohemia, is 2,120 feet. The Eselschacht, at Kuttenberg, in Bohemia, a mine which is now abandoned, reaches the enormous depth of 3,778 feet. At Rorerbiihel there were, in the sixteenth century, excavations to the depth of 3,107 feet, and the plans of the works are yet preserved. f These excavations appear the more wonderful wher. it is considered that they were made before the introduction of gunpowder. The old Kutten berger mine is an example of the greatest depth to which human labor has been able to penetrate; and if, to use the language of Humboldt, we compare its depth (a depth greater than the height of the Brocken, and only 200 feet less than that of Vesuvius) with the loftiest structures that the hands of man have erected, (with the Pyramid of Cheops, and with the Cathedral of Strasburg,) we find that they stand in the ratio of eight to one. The products of mines have contributed in a marked degree to the ad- * De la Beche and Burr. Humboldt, Cosmos, volume 1."], [142, "124 Doc. No. 69. vancenient of the human race. Without a knowledge of their applica tion to the useful arts, the human family would have remained in the rudest and most simple state of society, dependent on the chase or the spontaneous fruits of the earth for the means of subsistence; or certain tribes, under favorable circumstances, might have, become nomadic herds men. This knowledge rests at the foundation of the three great objects of human pursuit \u2014 agriculture, commerce, and manufactures. To show how intimately the metals are connected with the comforts and conveniences of life, we need only to refer to our daily observation. They afford to man the means of rapid communication between distant points; they are essential in the construction of the roof that shelters him, in the preparation of the food that nourishes him, and of the raiment wherewith he is clothed. It will be found, too, that the greatness of a nation is as dependent upon the geological structure of the country as upon any peculiarity of its laws and institutions. England owes her pre-eminence among European na tions as much to her mineral wealth as to the principles of her free consti tution. It is probable that she would have been as powerful as we now behold her, had she never been successively invaded by Roman, Dane, and Norman. Long before the Christian era, her shores were visited by the Tyrian fleet, in search of tin to convey to the then emporium of the world. Her mineral wealth has been the main-spring of her prosperity; and were this exhausied, she would sink to a second-rate power. It is this which has built her workshops and factories, and filled them with colossal machinery; it is this which has equipped her fleets, and made her the carrier of the world on the great highway of nations. Her exhaust less supply of fossil fuel has made Swansea the smelting-house for the copper of both hemispheres. It is this which moves her 20,000 steam engines, supplanting the labor of at least five millions of men, and per forming it with a precision and certainty which human hands could not attain . There are two inventions which have given the moderns infinitely greater facilities in the exploration of mines than were enjoyed by the ancients. These are the inventions of gunpowder and the steam-engine. The invention of the \u25a0 former has been ascribed to the Arabian alchy mists, but M. Reinaud has shown that their claim is without foundation. It was first used for blasting rocks in the Rammelsberg mines, in the Harz mountains, in the twelfth century. It was first introduced into England, according to Mr. Watson, early in the seventeenth century, by Prince Rupert, who brought over a gang of German miners and employed them in the copper mines of Staffordshire. It was not known in Somerset shire until 1620, after which it became introduced into Cornwall. It has been supposed that it was first used in the districts of Lelant, Zennor, and St. Ives, by two men, named Bell and Case, who came from the East. They kept their operations a profound secret, suffering no one to see them charge the holes; but a man of Zennor concealed himself behind a bolt, and discovered and revealed the mystery. The steam-engine has proved as efficient an auxiliary in the working of mines as gunpowder, and without its aid, many of the mines of Europe, now profitable, would be rendered worthless. The advantages of this agent have been graphically described by Mr."], [143, "Doc. No. 69. 125 Webster:* \" It is on the rivers, and the boatman may repose on his oars ; it is in highways, and begins to exert itself along the courses island con veyances; it is at the bottom of mines, a thousand feet below the earth's surface; it is in the mill, and in the workshops of the trades; it rows, it pumps, it excavates, it carries, it draws, it lifts, itbamtners, it spins, it weaves, it prints.\" ' The first steam-engine employed in mining in Great Britain was erected in Cornwall, between the years 1710 and 1714; now, the steam-power thus employed for these purposes, according to Mr. Watson, may be esti mated as amounting to the labor of 150,000 horses, or that of 750,000 men. In the Lake Superior copper region the position of the mines is generally exceedingly favorable for exploration; they are mostly situated in the lofty trappean cliffs, which afford great facilities for raising the ore and for draining the water. The usual method resorted to for the purpose of mining a vein, the position, underlie, and bearing of which have been determined, is to sink shafts on the lode where it is nearly vertical, or away from it where it is inclined, so as to intersect it at a given depth. In the latter case, it is necessary to excavate much unprofitable ground in order that the working shaft may be perpendicular. Simultaneously with these operations, it is advisable to commence the construction of an adit-level \u2014 a work requiring the exercise of the highest judgment and skill on the part of the mining engineer, not only to select the most advantageous site, but to intersect the shaft at a given point. The adit-level often serves the double purpose of draining the mine and of exploring the country through which it passes. Where a lode is profitable, the adventurers often expend large sums to get rid of a few inches of water. Professor Ansted states that he has often known J20,000 or ,\u00a330,000 expended in this way for the purpose of saving a single foot of water. We have before adverted to the immense sums expended at the Consolidated mines on these objects. The contents of the lode are attacked by means of horizontal galleries extending between the shafts. These are ordinarily driven at the depth of 50 or 60 feet. Winces or vertical shafts are often started from the ex tremities of the galleries, for the purposes of ventilation and laying bare the lode. In this way the metallic contents of a vein are cut into a series of oblong blocks, the removal of which is called stopeing. This is ac complished in two ways\u2014either from above or below. In either case the excavations are disposed in steps, like a stair. One miner cuts out a rec tangular mass from 4 to 6 yards in length and -2 yards high. While he is carrying forward this work, another miner commences two yards be neath the first, and in the same manner excavates the rock beneath his feet. In this manner as many miners operate simultaneously as there are steps between the two horizontal galleries. As they advance, wooden floors are constructed for the purpose of sustaining the attle or rubbish. Such portions of the lode only are taken down as are supposed to be sufficiently rich to pay for the extraction of the metal. This method of working will l\u00bbe readily understood from an inspection of the sections of the mines attached to the descriptions in this chapter. The ascent and descent of the miners is effected by means of ladders placed against the shaft, interrupted at every ten fathoms by floors. In- * Address before the Boston Lyceum."], [144, "126 Doc. No. 69. ventions for ascending and descending by machinery have been put in practice in the deep mines of the Harz, and other districts where the mines have been worked to a great depth, by which a great saving of time is effected. The timbering of the shafts and adits forms in many mines a very considerable item of expense. In Cornwall, the timber mostly employed is Norwegian pine; in Germany, on the contrary, oak is chiefly used. Such kinds of wood as can be had at the least cost are generally used, though the importance of sound timbering in extensive mines is very great, and the condition of this portion of the work forms a considerable item in estimating the value of a mine which has been long worked. The quan tity of timber in the Cornish mines is so great that it has been estimated that it would require one hundred and forty square miles of Norwegian sorest to siippfy it. The quantity of timbering required in the Lake Superior mines is com paratively small, since the walls of the shafts are of firm and unyielding rock; but near the surface, where the rock is broken and disintegrated, strong supports are requisite. The annexed sketch (fig. IS) will explain the method of timbering a horizontal excavation through which a tram-road is laid for conveying the ores to the surface : , Fig. 16. In the Lake Superior land district, the resinous trees af ford the best material for tim bering; and the tamarack, in strength and durability, will probably be found superior to all others. The spars should be deprived of their bark, as, by retaining the moisture, it accelerates decomposition . The pumping of the water from the mines, and the raising of the ore, in thjs district, have been thus far effected principal ly by horse-whims. At the Cliff mine it was the intention of the proprietors to put up steam machinery for this purpose during the past winter, which we presume is now in successful operation. This agency will ultimately be employed at all the mines, even where water power can be made available; for, in a region where the climate is so rigorous as on the borders of Lake Superior, and where for months in succession the thermometer does not range above the freezing point, there is too much uncertainty connected with the use of the latter. In the stamping mills, during the intensely cold weather, it becomes necessary to resort to fires to prevent the steam from congealing on the engine, in long icicles, and the ice from forming on the stamp-heads. In an ex tensively opened mine, giving employment to many hundred people, un certainties of this kind must be avoided. The work must progress from day to day, the stopers following fast on the drivers."], [145, ""], [146, "ArM^'^m,, sltth .nSSr-oadMxrtfrr PLATETM \u25a0_-____p-^iF-^s^11|||nri_iiisiiWM__n-T_imT--ni\u00a5ii SECTION OF THE CLIFF MINE"], [147, "Doc.

In raising the heavy masses of copper at the Cliff mine, a powerful capstan is used, in connexion with suitable tackle, by which a jveight of several tons can be raised. Having thus briefly noticed the general nature of the exploration, we will now proceed to describe the principal mines in this district; and \"to illustrate the method of working, and the progress of the under-ground operations, we have prepared several sections, taken principally from surveys and measurements of Mr. Hill. CLIFF MINE. The Cliff mine is situated on Keweenaw Point, about three miles from the lake shore, in the southwest quarter sectioh 36, township 58 north, range 32 west. A range of elevated hills sweeps round in a crescent/orm, trending in a southwesterly direction, and forming the western boundary of the valley of Eagle rh~er. In places these hills attain an elevation of 800 feet, and towards the valley present bold mural escapments, while on. the side exposed to the lake the slope is gradual. This range is composed of trappean roeks. The summit is capped by a hard crystalline greenstone, as at the Cliff mine, passing into a feldspathic porphyry, as at the Albion. Below, and forming the base of the ridge, is a belt of granular trap, oc- casionally amygdaloidal. Between the two there is a thin belt of slaty chlorite about twelve feet in thickness. These belts dip to the north at an angle of 45\u00b0, conforming in this respect to the inclination of the detrital rocks which flank the range on the north. Wherever veins are observed in the greenstone, they are found to be pinched and barren; but where they enter the compact or granular trap they expand in width, and be- come charged with metal. This trap has a good degree of firmness, and consists of labrador feldspar, and chlorite. It has been remarked that the best rock in this region for productive veins is neither a crystalline green- stone nor a soft porous amygdaloid, but a granular trap, with occasional amygdules scattered through it, and possessing a good degree of consist- ency. Where veins enter the greenstone, as before remarked, they be- come pinched; where they penetrate the soft amygdaloid, they become s-attered and lose themselves."], [148, "Doc. No. 69. 128 The lode of the Cliff mine is seen to occupy a break or depression in the hill, and thence can be traced to its base. It was discovered in the summer of 1845, and during the succeeding fall a drift was carried into the greenstone about one hundred feet, (see plan, A,) and between that point and the summit several others were opened. When first discovered, the vein could only be seen in the upper belt of greenstone, the metallifer ous zone being concealed by detritus. No one could have inferred from its appearance at that time that the enormous masses of copper existed but a short distance below which subsequent explorations revealed. It was examined by Dr. Jackson and Mr. Whitney conjointly, about the time of its discovery, who reported that the surface indications were not highly favorable at the points where the vein was exposed, but that, as it became wider and richer in its downward course, the company^ should by all means make a thorough examination by uncovering and 'examining the vein at the base of the cliff. At the summit ft appeared hardly more than an inch or two in width: the gangue was mostly prehnite, with copper associated with silver, incrusted with beautiful capillary crystals of red oxide. Further down the vein was again exposed; here it had expanded to the width of nearly two feet, the veinstone consisting of a series of reticulations of laumonite. . Up to this period the sandstone and conglomerate were supposed by many to afford the best mining-ground, and that to this source they were to look for permanent supplies of the sulphurets of copper. During the winter of 1845-'46, some German miners, in clearing away the talus near the base of the cliff, discovered a small loose specimen of mass copper. This stimulated them in their researches, which resulted in the discovery of the vein in the belt of granular trap (b) about twelve feet to the east, showing that it had been subjected to that amount of heave or dislocation. From that point a level was carried into the hill seventy feet before anything valuable was developed, when the great mass, so called, was struck \u2014 a fortunate circumstance, not only to the company, but to the whole mining interest on Lake Superior. It gave encourage ment to those engaged in these pursuits, and induced them to persevere. It also demonstrated the true source from which the loose masses occa sionally found on the lake shore had been derived. It demolished the fanciful theory advanced by at least one geologist as to the transport of the Ontonagon mass from Isle Royale, and showed that it was not neces sary to resort to icebergs and changes in the relative level of land and water to account satisfactorily for its position. From that time to the present day, hardly a month has elapsed without developing new masses; and their occurrence, so far from creating wonder, is regarded as a matter of course. The largest single mass hitherto exposed weighed about fifty tons. The position of the mass copper in the vein is indicated by the spaces between the dotted lines marked M, while the intervening spaces, marked S, afford stamp -work. It will be seen, by reference to the plan, that the levels 1, 2, and 3 have been extended northwardly into the greenstone before described, but in no instance has the vein been found after having pierced that rock. This arises probably from the lateral dislocation before referred to, the true posi tion of the vein being twelve feet to the west. As a matter of curiosity even, it would be desirable to cross-cut to determine the extent of this fault, and the character of the vein where it enters the greenstone. It will,"], [149, ""], [150, ""], [151, "Doc. No. 69. 129 without doubt, be found less metalliferous at that point than in the granu lar trap which contains the present workings. The deepest shaft in this mine has been sunk 270 feet below the sur face. The other two are little less in depth. The adit, which drains the mine to the depth of 100 feet below the first gallery, has been extended 750 feet. The amount of stopeing and timbering, and the disposition of the attle, or rubbish, will be seen by inspecting the plan. The force employed in this mine at the present time consists of 160 men. The mine is under the management of Capt. Jennings, who has displayed much energy and judgment in developing it. If any criticism may be allowed, it would be to the effect that there has been no increase in the force for the last eighteen months. The openings in the mine should bo in advance of the stope-work. By pushing these forward the country is explored, ample space is given to the miners to work, and op portunities from time to time afforded to increase the force. The. machinery employed for raising the ore and freeing the mine from water is admirably contrived; but the mine is now so thoroughly opened that the company will soon substitute a steam-engine in the place of horse-power. The stamps erected here were the first which operated successfully, and have served as a model for the mines in other parts of the district. * The connexion between the different parts of the mine is exhibited in Plate VIII, which is to be regarded as a plan, rather than a landscape. The cliff in the back ground consists of the crystalline greenstone before described. The vein traverses it in a nearly perpendicular direction, pierced by several galleries which extend no great distance, as will be seen by reference to the section, Plate VII \u2014 the vein here proving to be contracted and meagre in metal. The mining ground, represented in Plate VII occurs below the cliff of greenstone in a belt of amygdaloidal trap, and the relations of the two rocks are exhibited in the plan last re- ferred to. The poppet-heads and whims for raising the ore and water are seen at the entrance of the shafts. The building near the centre is use\"1 for calcining the rock preparatory to stamping it, assorting the ore, ana cutting the mass copper. The building on the extreme right contains the stamps and washing apparatus, which will be described in detail in another chapter. The productiveness of this vein may be inferred from the amount of stopeing which has been done, which is represented by the dark portions in the section, Plate VII. The disposition of the attle is also there represented. From the reports of the trustees rendered in 1849 and 1S50 we gather the following information: The amount of capital stock paid in by the stockholders = 3110,000. The personal effects of the company on the 1st of December, 1S48, were $140,982, leaving a surplus of $111,105\u2014 a sum a little more than equiv alent to the entire capital stock.

Its geological position is similar to that of the Cliff mine before described, both being in the same range of cliffs, and occupying adjoining quarter sections. The veins, however, are distinct. From the surface to the point B, in the smaller shaft, the lode dips 23\u00b0 below the horizon, where it is intersected by a small vein or feeder, beyond which, in its downward course, it dips but one foot in six. The following sketch represents a cross-section above thepoint B. Here, the lode was found to be of little value, contracting to a foot or eighteeir inches in width, and affording stamp work of an inferior quality. Below, it in creases in width, and becomes highly metallifer ous. At the point C, another feeder comes in, which, like the former, enriches and expands the lode still further. The walls are very variable. In some places, they contract to a mere fissure; again they expand to seven feet. This expan sion is observed 'where the vein C conies into Fig 20, the main lode. Through the entire length of the lower level, it has been found good, containing in some places mass copper. From an examina tion at the depth of ninety-five feet, it is inferred that the veinstone is 3 or 3| per cent, richer than that taken from the second level. \u2022 The stamp work, at present, yields about 7 per cent. This estimate, we are aware, is 3 per cent, lower than the agent rates it. From every bunch of ore containing 30 tons there are taken 4 tons of what is called barrel work, yielding 40 per cent, of copper, and the addition of the masses at 60 per cent, will make the average yield of the contents entire not far from 9^ per cent. The gross amount of copper taken from the mine during the past year is not far from 1,400 tons, which will yield 129\u00a3 tons of pure copper. The mine has not been opened sufficiently, except within the last seven months, to admit workmen to advantage. Thirty-five tons of copper have been sent to market during the past season, and the product for the next season may be safely rated at 200 tons. When fairly opened, it 'will annually yield from 400 to 600 tons of pure copper. The stamps connected with this mine are the best hitherto erected in this region. They are driven by a steam-engine, and with eight stampers are capable of turning out 80 or 90 tons per week. Appended to the section is a view of the vein as it appeared at the point A, in the lower level, 180 feet below the surface. A sheet of native copper, one foot in diameter, was seen to occupy the foot- wall, and to ex tend from the bottom to the top of the gallery. The other portion of the vein, one foot in thickness, was composed of calc-spar, quartz, chlorite, and epidote, filled with small spangles of copper.

No. 69. 133 Minnesota mine. \u2014 This mine is situated about two miles east of this Ontonagon river, and fifteen miles from its mouth, (NW. quarter section 15, township 50 N., range 39 W.) The trap ranges here run in a NE. and SW. direction, and attain an elevation of about 700 feet above the. lake. Like the range of Keweenaw Point, they are flanked by sandstone and conglomerate, dipping northerly, besides containing intercalated beds of these detrital rocks. The section of the adit appended to the plan of this mine shows the relation of one of these sedimentary beds to the igneous formation. This vein belongs to a system totally distinct from that of Keweenaw Point. While the latter system crosses the formation at nearly right an gles, the former has a course and inclination nearly conformable to those of the accompanying sedimentary rocks. The inclination of this vein is north 52\u00b0, which is parallel with the sandstone seen at the base of the hill. {Tide section of the adit before referred to.) The veinstone consists of epidote, chlorite, quartz, aud cale spar, distinct in character from the wall-rock. The walls of the vein are, for the most part, well defined, exhibiting the grooved and polished appearance, termed by the Germans slickemides. Throughout the gangue, copper exists in masses, bunches, and spangles. Silver occurs in places in connexion with calc-spar and chlorite, one* specimen of which weighed eight ounces. In the spring of 1S49, we examined this mine before any stopeing had been done. The drift had been exteuded between the two shafts, 156 feet apart. At the point of intersection between shaft No. 1 and the drift, a mass of nearly pure copper five feet in thickness was ex posed, occupying the hanging-wall. A few feet east, it was observed to change its position and occupy the foot- wall. The sheet copper appeared to be nearly continuous between the two shafts. The width of the vein at the point where the level intersects the shaft No. 1 was found to be eight feet, but at shaft No. 2 contracted to three feet. .This increased width is due to a feeder or branch which intersects the main lode and becomes merged with it, where shaft No. 1 is sunk. To the west of this point, a drift has since been extended eighteen feet in length and thirty-eight feet below the surface. Here, the vein expands to eight feet, and is almost entirely filled in with sheets of native copper. Shoots branch off from the main mass, occupying the fissures, so as to interpose a brazen barrier to further driving in that direction. These masses can only be reached by stopeing from the adit-level upward until they are intersected, and then driving along their sides. By means of powerful sand-blasts placed between the sheets and the hanging-wall, they can be thrown down; after which, a great amount of labor remains to be performed, in cutting them into blocks, so that they may be removed to the surface, where they must undergo still another subdivision into blocks of one or two tons weight, that they may be transported to the river. The sheets between shafts Nos. 1 and 2, where the vein was stoped, yielded no masses of any great thickness. At shaft No. 2, 42 feet below the surface, a mass of copper was struck, and the sinking contin- ued beside it to the depth of 55 feet, which was found extending into the level westerly. Portions of this mass were taken down, while other por- tions remain on the hanging-wall. These points are indicated by the letters M, M.

This was the character of the vein between shafts Nos. 1 and 2. In shaft No. 3, 180 feet west, the vein is 28 inches in thickness, including the rocky portion, and presents the following section: 1. Quartz and chlorite, with copper in strings and bunches. 2, 3. Beds of rock, similar to the wall-rock, with thin sheets of copper filling the seams, in sufficient abundance to pay for working this portion of the vein. 4. Quartz, chlorite, calc-spar, and epidote, contain ing a large per centage of copper, in masses, bunches, and disseminated. In certain portions of the lode, these beds of rock disappear, the whole matrix being filled with materials distinct from the walls. Fig. 21. According to the statement of Mi. Knapp, the agent of this mine, whose energy and zeal in exploring this tract we have noticed under another head, there were taken from this mine, last year, (1848,) eleven tons of copper, seven and a half of which were, included in the mass raised by the ancient miners, the position of which is indicated in the plan. (See shaft No. 1.) This was sent to market before the company had fairly commenced ope rations. During the past season, there have been taken from the mine 57 tons of copper, in masses, estimated at 75 per cent., and 700 tons of stamp-work, estimated at 6 per cent., making in the aggregate S4| tons of pure copper \u2014 the mass of the veinstone yielding nearly llf per cent. There are now exposed, in the shafts and levels, about 30 tons in masses, besides a considerable quantity of stamp-work. A year has not elapsed since this mine was opened, and none of the shafts have been extended to a greater depth than 57 feet. No mine in the country has produced so great an amount of copper, with the same amount of labor and capital expended. We cannot find its parallel in the whole history of copper-mining, wherever prosecuted. Plan of the mine. \u2014 An adit-level is now being driven from the base of the hill to intersect the vein, at nearly right angles with its course, at shaft No. 3. Its length, when completed, will be 375 feet. Thence, it will be extended along the course of the vein so as to strike the several shafts. Shaft No. 1 will be intersected 77 feet below the surface; shaft No. 2, at 87 feet; and shaft No. 3, at 86 feet. The shaded portions represent the pre sent workings, while the light portions show what remains to be accom plished. The ancient workings are indicated by a series of oblique lines. The Minnesota vein can be traced along the surface for the distance of a mile or more, and in this respect it admits of the employment of a greater number of miners than any vein yet discovered in the copper re gion. The containing rock is a dark-gray, mottled trap, of a granular texture, with occasional almond shaped cavities through it. It breaks into rhomboidal blocks, and readily yields under the drill. Its constituents are hornblende, feldspar, and chlorite. The section of the adit protracted 300 yards north cuts no less than six veins, some of which conform in dip to the vein now wrought, while others intersect the rocky planes perpendicularly. The company now employ 84 men, about one-half of whom are as signed to the mine, while the other half are employed in erecting the"], [163, "PI. XII. /Icktmian.

These will consist of a whim-house, a house for calcining 'aud assorting the ore, a stamping and washing-mill, with a saw-mill attached. They have already erected five dwelling houses, two smitheries, two barns and other out-buildings, and a commodious warehouse, on the right bank of the Ontonagon. They have constructed an excellent road to the river, 2A miles distant, and cleared and culti vated about 45 acres of land. They raised during the past year 500 bushels of potatoes, 300 bushels of turnips, and other vegetables. This work seems almost incredible, when it is considered that, a year ago, there was hardly a tree felled on the location, hardly a cubic foot of rock excavated from the vein. Northwest mine. \u2014 This mine is situated on Keweenaw Point, (section 15, township 58 N., range 30 W.,) in the same belt of trap in which are contained the Cliff and North American mines. It occurs on the southern slope of the northern trap range, and overlooks the valley of the Little Montreal river, v Fig. 22. The above sketch will convey an idea of the nature and extent of the workings. The rock is a dark gray compact trap, occasionally amygda loidal. To the north of shaft No. 4, occurs a belt of conglomerate about 12 feet in thickness, with a northerly inclination of 40\u00b0, reposing on a brecciated trap. Within a space of 300 yards are three distinct and well defined veins, whose bearing and underlie are as follows: East vein, bearing north 16^\u00b0 east, underlie 8\u00b0 east. Middle vein, \" ' \" 19\u00b0 west, \" 8\u00b0 west. West vein, \" \" 17\" west, \" 12\u00b0 west. It is not improbable that all may ultimately be found to converge and form a single lode of great power. The main workings have been prose cuted on the eastern vein. An adit-level has been driven 500 feet; when extended 136 feet farther, it will intersect shaft No. 4, at the depth of 73 feet. ( Another gallery has been opened, 60 feet below, and a portion of the lode removed, the stopeing being represented by the shaded lines. The vein, along the course of the adit, is well defined, and varies in width from a few inches to two feet. In the northern part, where the present workings are prosecuted, it expands to 2\\ feet, and is highly charged with copper. At the northern extremity of the second level, the vein is 31 inches in width. At the bottom of shaft No. 3, 90 feet from the surface, the vein is observed to have a greater expansion than at any intermediate point."], [166, "136 Doc. No. 69. Its impregnation appears to have taken place at two different periods. The western seam is composed of chlorite and calc spar, with but little quartz; the copper occuriiig disseminated and in thin plates. The eastern seam is composed of quartz and calc-spar, with but little chlorite\u2014 the copper occurring in masses, bunches, and strings. Where the fissure was observed to be subsident, the walls came almost in contact. Where, on the other hand, the fissure was nearly perpen dicular, the vein had the widest expansion. ]_\u201e:__ Two shafts have been sunk on the west vein, each to thejlepth 01 50 feet. Froin one of these a level has been extended SO feet, and a portion of the lode removed, and masses weighing a ton and upwards have been taken down. This vein promises to be of great value. The product of this mine, according to the best information, up to the present time, hag been 50' tons of mass copper, yielding 50 per cent., and 500 tons of 8 per cent, stamp-work. The present force, employed consists of 53 miners and 42 surface men. \u2022' Copper Falls' mine.\u2014 The old mine is situated on the northern slope of the trap range, about two miles from the lake shore. Within that space there are four alternations of trap and conglomerate. The belt in which the lode is situated is only a hundred and fifty feet in thickness, and dips northerly at an angle of 33\u00b0. A belt of conglomerate reposes upon it, forming the northern slope of the hill; while a belt cf metamorphosed sandstone, fifty feet or more in thickness, occurs below. The annexed sketch illustrates the relative position of the igneous and aqueous rocks. Fig. 23. So long as the workings were confined to the belt of trap, the vein was productive \u2014 yielding stamp-work and masses, the largest of which weighed 12 tons. On striking the sandstone, however, it was observed to change in its mineral contents and richness. The shaft E, has been ex tended through the sandstone into the belt of trap below, and the fissure appeared to be continuous through the different formations; but at the depth of 6 feet in the sandstone, the vein had contracted to four inches. Shortly after the intersection it was observed to branch\u2014 one branch dip ping rapidly to the west, and the other to the east. The shaft was con tinued perpendicularly through the sandstone, thus losing sight of both branches. On reaching the lower belt of trap, a drift was extended to the right and left, to the distance of 18 feet, without intersecting either branch. In this stage the workings were suspended. It is desirable to have these workings continued still further, as they will solve one of"], [167, "Doc. No. 69. 137 the most interesting problems in the mineral region\u2014 i. e., the changes which veins undergo in their passage through different mineral planes. The company are now developing a veinbetween sections 11 and 12, known as the Childs vein. Its geological position is the same in refer ence to the sandstone as the one before described. It bears east of south, and dips westerly. A few feet to the west, another vein can be traced along the surface, in which may be seen pits which were sunk by the ancient miners. An adit has been commenced, which will be extended 256 feet, wfyen it will intersect the shaft on the Childs vein at the depth of 64 feet, and in its progress develop the other vein. The belt of trap is much wider at this point than at the abandoned mine. In sinking the shaft, some masses of copper were found weighing from thirty to fifty pounds; but the disseminated copper was incon siderable. Near the centre of section 12 is another vein, on which a shaft has been sunk to the depth of thirty-seven feet, without having developed much copper. The vein is about a foot in width, the gangue of which consists of calcareous spar, with traces of chlorite. The shaft is in the upper portion of the trap belt which underlies the sandstone at the old works, and takes into its composition a large proportion of chlorite. Thirty rods to the south-southwest is another vein of much greater promise. The course is nearly north and south, and the matrix consists of prehnite, highly charged with particles of copper. The total product of this mine up to the present time is as follows: Copper masses and barrel-work, averaging 70 per cent. - 90, 959 lbs. Stamp- work, averaging 10 per cent. ;- - - 497,500 \" Total - ... . . 588,459 \u00ab The Northwestern mine is situated in the same trap belt as the North west \u2014 the same stratum of conglomerate showing itself near the brow of the hill. It is in section 24, township 5S north, range 58 west. The vein crosses the formation, bearing northerly. Two trial shafts have been sunk to the depth of twenty four and thirty-six feet respectively, which yielded copper, in masses and disseminated, in considerable abundance. The in dications are that this is a vein of much power, and the company in possession ought to test it thoroughly. Ph\u0153nix, formerly Lake Superior, mine occurs in the bed of Eagle river, about a mile above its embouchure. This tract was among the first located in this region, and this company among the first to embark m mining adventures. In the early days of copper-mining, this lode was represented as possessing unparalleled richness \u2014 the silver far exceeding the copper in value; and these representations contributed powerfully towards the creation and maintenance of the copper mania which prevailed for a time throughout the eastern cities. The most extravagant ex pectations were formed, and the most exaggerated statements* made, as to the mineral wealth of the country. Many were doomed to a speedy and bitter disappointment; but the ultimate effects Jiave been to divert capital into a new and untried channel, and develop the mineral wealth of a \u2022The first report of the trustees contains a statement of the result of an assay as so lows: In a ton of rock \u2014 Silver, 152.56 pounds, valued at - - ... - $3,053 20 Copper, 203.57 pounds, valued at - - - - - 83 57 S3.13C 77."], [168, "Doc. No. 69. 138 region which, but for these representations, might have remained for a long time unexplored. This vein, as before remarked, is situated about a mile from the lake shore; and between these two points there are no less than seventeen alternations of trap and conglomerate. From the fact that veins exhibit great disturbance and great variableness in their metallic contents in their passage through different belts of rock, it is evident that the best mining-ground lies south of these alternations. In that direction, how ever, it is circumscribed by a belt of hard, crystalline greenstone, in which the veins are seldom well developed. The lode is seen in the bed of the stream about a thousand feet above the main shaft, where it is distinctly marked. The matrix consists of calc-spar, prehnite, and radiated quartz, containing native copper in strings and disseminated. It is from one to two feet in width, and bears north 17\u00b0 east, with a slight dip to the east. Thence it is to be traced down the stream, occasionally concealed by loose rocks and gravel. In the winter of 1844, a trial shaft was commenced at this point, on the left bank of the stream. This, however, had been prosecuted only to the depth of twenty feet, when it was, under the direction of the mining engineer, abandoned, and another shaft commenced further down the stream. Here there was no appearance of a vein; no gangue distinct from the wall-rock; no powerful fissure to indicate the dislocation of the mass; no polished surfaces on the face of the cliff. The true position of the vein was several feet to the east, in the bed of the stream; but it was not apparent, from the accumulation of water- worn materials. The shaft was sunk through a dark-brown au^gdaloid, with little adhesion between the particles \u2014 the amygdules being filled in places with native copper, exhibiting occasional points of silver. This peculiarity could be traced fora distance of eleven feet from the stream, becoming less apparent as it receded from the bank. On the immediate bank, however, the rock was less amygdaloidal, and took in a larger proportion of chlorite. The change in the location of the shaft was injudicious in two respects: 1. The old shaft was on the vein, and, had it been prosecuted, would have proved it, while the new shaft was not on the vein, but to the west of it. 2. It was located so near the' river bank, that the water percolating through the fissures proved a con stant source of annoyance, in the progress of the work. In his report to the company, the. mining engineerrepresents the vein as eleven feet in width \u2014 a vein of greater power than any three thus far discovered in this region \u2014 eighteen hundred feet in length, as far as known, and containing an amount of ore, already exposed, which could not be exhausted within the present generation.* Its richness was unparalleled. As the shaft was continued downward, the indications of copper became less apparent, until finally they disappeared altogether, and nothing was brought up but barren rock. At the depth of 60 feet, if we mistake not, the miners came to a pocket in the rock filled with gravel and water- worn accumulations. They then drifted * Wequotefrom the\u00bbreport: \"The whole known length of the vein isabout eighteen hundred feet. Its width is satisfactorily proved to be eleven feet for the distance of two hundred feet ; and it is probable that it will hold a workable width throughout the eighteen hundred feet. It is obvious that there is an adequate quantity of rich ore in this vein to render the work very profitable, and that there is no danger of exhausting the ore, even should it give out at the depth of one hundred feet, of which there is no probability. *. * * If the ore runs outat a considerable depth, say two hundred feet, it will be a matter of little importance to the present generation, though it might be to posterity.\""], [169, "Doc. No. 69. 139 under the bed of the stream in pursuit of the vein, but were unsuccessful. In removing the water-worn materials, they found numerous boulders of \u25a0copper, varying in weight from half an ounce to 600 pounds\u2014 so numer ous, indeed, that portions of the gravel were profitably washed for the metallic contents. In this connexion was also found a mass of native silver weighing eight pounds \u2014 the largest yet discovered in this region. The main shaft was carried to the depth of 75 feet, when the workings were suspended; nor have they since been resumed. That there is a vein of great richness on that location, and in the vi cinity of the present workings, is evidenced by the numerous water worn masses of copper found in the bed of the stream. They have not come from far. As the matrix of the vein is more yielding than the associated rocks, it frequently prescribes the direction of a stream and forms its bed. That will probably be found the case here. The pocket before de scribed was excavated by the agency of the stream in the gangue of the vein. The west vein on this location, known as Sheffield & Nott's, is about 11 inches in width, and bears north 19\u00b0 west. The veinstone con sists of chlorite and calc-spar, traversing greenstone, resting on a porous amygdaloid. A trial shaft has been sunk, which afforded indications of \u2022considerable value. Lac la Belle mine \u2014 Bohemian mine. \u2014 The workings of these com panies have been prosecuted on the same vein\u2014 those of the former in the base of the Bohemian mountain, those of the latter on its summit. This mountain rises to the height of 864 feet above Lac la Belle, and from its summit is afforded a view of great extent and beauty. The rock consists of chlorite and feldspar of a highly crystalline texture, and ap- pears to be of an age posterior to the bedded trap in which the mines be- fore described are situated, since these beds are found dipping from it like the strata of detrital rocks. It was protruded in vast irregular masses, forming a continuous line of elevation. The metallic contents of this rock are entirely distinct from those of the bedded trap. While the latter is characterized by veins of native copper, the former abounds in the sulphurels of copper, such as the gray and black' sulphuret and copper- pyrites. Two sets of veins have been observed \u2014 one bearing north 26.^\u00b0 west, which appear to be the main ones, and another bearing north 80\u00b0 east. The gangue consists of calc-spar, chlorite, and quartz. Two shafts have been sunk near the summit of the hill \u2014 one to the depth of 106 feet, the Other to the depth of 75 feet \u2014 without developing a rich vein. The Lac la Belle Company extended a drift into the hill, 309 feet above the lake-level, to the distance of nearly 400 feet. They found the vein 18 inches in width, and rich in the sulphurets. Their main efforts, however, have been concentrated on an adit which starts 25 feet i tove the level of the lake, and has been driven 900 feet. As they have> cb- ably left the main vein in the prosecution of the work, its value cat iot be determined at this depth without a cross-cut. No place on Lake Superior affords greater facilities for mining; and the efforts of the company deserve to be crowned with success, Quincy mine is situated near Portage lake, on section 26, township 55, range 34. The surface of the country rises somewhat abruptly from the water, not in broken cliffs, but rounded hills. The elevation of this"], [170, "140 Doc. No. 69. mine is, by estimation. 400 feet.

The vein bears north 43c east, and dips rapidly to the north, corresponding with the course ot the formation\u2014 the only instance of the kind observed on Keweenaw Point. A string or branch was observed in a ravine near by, bearing north 45\u00b0 west, which yielded native copper in sheets of considerable size. This mine, at the time of our visit, had not been sufficiently developed to en able us to form an opinion as to its value. Forsytk mine occurs in the southeast quarter of section 33, township 57, range 32. The vein, which bears north 9A\u00b0 west, is distinctly seen cutting a hill, which rises a hundred feet above the surrounding plain. Two years ago, a shaft was sunk to the depth of 70 feet, and two others to an inconsiderable depth, since which time the work has been abandoned. As the water had filled these excavations, it was impossible for us to ex amine the vein critically. From the veinstone brought to-day, copper in sheets and disseminated was found in considerable abundance. Native silver was also found in this association to an extent thus far unobserved in any other mine on Lake Superior. The external indications here are favorable; but we ave not advised whether the company purpose resuming operations. Albion mine is situated in the same bluffs as the Cliff and North Ameri can, on section 11, township 57, range 32. The cliff, which attains an elevation of nearly 800 feet above the lake, is composed of a hard crystalline greenstone, passing into a porphyry, where the crystals of feldspar are imbedded in a matrix of hornblende. On the western slope, a thin but well-marked vein, filled with arsenical, pyritous copper, is ob served occupying a depression in the soil for a distance of 80 rods. Mr. Stevens, the agent of the company, informs us that at either end it branches into numerous strings and becomes lost. On the southeast side of the bluff, a shaft has been sunk to the depth of one hundred feet, striking the amygdaloid at the depth of 97 feet, from the bottom of which a drift was extended into the hill along the course of the vein. The workings have not been prosecuted sufficiently to determine its value. This vein bears north 46\u00b0 west. Its matrix consists of calc-spar and chlorite, with thin scales cf native copper, and is about 18 inches in width. Forest mine. \u2014 This mine is situated on the northeast quarter of section 36, township 50, range 40, within the limits of what is known as the \" Cushman location,\" on the left bank of the Ontonagon river. The old workings, under the direction of Cushman, on the north half of sec tion 36, do not appear to have developed veins of much value. They have been described in a preceding part of this report. \"The Dutch vein,\" on the northeast quarter of section 31, has been explored to the depth of about fifty feet. Its course is north 70\u00b0 east, ranging with the formation; its inclination, 40\u00b0 below the horizon. The veinstone is composed of epidote and quartz, twelve feet in thickness, with thin plates of copper disseminated through the mass, affording indi cations of considerable promise. In the chapter on ancient mining we have described with some minute ness the pits and excavations found on the southwest quarter of section"], [171, "Doc. No. 69. 141 30, and on section 31. The following sketch may be regarded as an Fig. 24. approximative representation of the contour of the cliff, and of the position of the veins on the latter tract. The inclination of the main lode is 78\u00b0. The ancient miners had excavated to the depth of 19 feet, and this has been continued by the adventurers to the depth of 23 feet. The two veins to the south, from their inclination, prob ably intersect the main one at points below the 23-foot excavation. Should the inclination be found to continue cutting the strata or bands in the same plane, it will present the same phenomena as the main veins in Cornwall. A section of the vein, as it appears in the shaft, is appended. The wall-rocks are composed of amygdaloid and granular trap, with a large admixture of chlorite. The vein, which is about three feet in width, is composed of the following materials, and arranged in this order: 1. A seam of laumonite an inch in width. 2. Calc-spar, quartz, chlorite, and epidote, with copper in bunches and disseminated. 3. Carbonate of copper, probably the result of atmos- pheric changes. 4. Epidote, chlorite, and amygdaloidal trap. 5. Masses of copper associated with spar, quartz, and il\" epidote. To the east of this shaft another has been commenced, Fig. 25. at the bottom of one of the ancient excavations. At this point the vein exhib its very much the same appearance, having the same inclination, and yield ing copper in considerable abundance. Few veins in the mineral region have been opened which, on the surface, afforded indications of greater promise.

Adventure mine \u2014 south west quarter of section 36, and southeast quarter of section 35, township 51, range 38, in the Algonquin mountains. A cliff rises to the height of more than 150 feet above the surrounding country, and to the south presents a bold mural escarpment, while to the north it slopes gradually towards the lake. The rock is a hard, crystalline greenstone, somewhat porphyritic, traversed by occasional strings or seams, filled in with calc-spar and epidote, associated with native cop per. We saw no well- developed vein \u2014 nothing to indicate a permanent supply of metal. A shaft has been sunk on one of these strings to the depth of 20 feet, near the brow of the cliff. The Ridge mine is situated on the southwest quarter of section 35, township 51, range 38, and is in the same axis of upheaval. Workings have been prosecuted only to a limited extent. The ground in the vicinity exhibits numerous pits \u2014 the work of a former generation. At one point a vein is exposed, included within a feldspar and hornblende rock . dipping to the north, which affords copper in stiings and disseminated. This vein, like most of the veins in the region between Portage lake and the Ontonagon river, has a bearing and dip corresponding with the adjacent stratified rocks. The Aztec Mining Company occupy the northeast quarter of section 36, township 51, range 38, and the northwest quarter of section 31, and"], [172, "142 Doc. No. 69. the southwest quarter of section 30, township 51, range 37. The point where mining operations have been commenced is on the northeast quarter of section 31. A vein is seen near the brow of a cliff, bearing west southwest, and dipping to the north at an angle of 46\u00b0. It has not been sufficiently opened to enable one to form an opinion of its value. The Douglass Houghton mine is on the northeast quarter of section 15, township 5] , range 37. Two years ago the vein was opened to the depth of 40 feet, when further operations were abandoned, but the work has been resumed, under the direction of Mr. C. C. Douglass, one of the most efficient mining engineers in the region. The vein, which traverses a com pact chlorite trap, is about three feet in width, running nearly north and south, conforming to the general direction of the ridge at this place, and dipping west 60\u00b0. They have driven a level about 25 feet along its course, and a considerable quantity of copper has been obtained. The vein stone removed was rich in disseminated and string copper, and will yield from 8 lo 12 per cent, of 'metal. Quartz, much of which is colored red with the sub-oxide of copper, forms the principal portion of the matrix, which is traversed by numerous seams of chlorite. The vein is well defined, and affords indications of proving highly valuable. The Algonquin mine is on section 36, township 52, range 37. It has been temporarily abandoned for the last two years, and no work worthy of description has been done here. All of the information in our possession will be found under the head of \"Geology of the trap region.\" The Pittsburg and Isle Royale Company are developing a vein on the northwest quarter of section 12, township 65, range 36, near Todd's Harbor, Isle Royale. The following diagram will represent the present condition of the work: Fig. 26 The vein traverses a hard, crystalline greenstone, bear ing N. 20\u00b0 E., with an under lie of 12\u00b0 to the east. Shaft No. 1, has been sunk upon it to the depth of 63 feet. Shaft No. 2, reaches to the depth of 67 feet. Adit No. 1, starts from the 'water's edge, and intersects the shaft at the distance of 42 feet. The second level connect ing the two shafts is 113 feet in length. Near the surface the vein appears pinched \u2014 attaining a width of only a few inches; but at the extremity of the 113 foot adit, and 50 feet below the surface, it expands to a width of 18 inches, and presents the following section: Fig. 27. I. Sheet of native copper, varying from one-half to one and a half inches in width, and nearly continuous, occu pying the foot-wall. 2. Veinstone of calc-spar, quartz, prehnite, and lau monite, with diffused copper. At the entrance 'of the drift the sheet copper is observed to occupy the hanging-wall, but it very soon crosses the vein and continues in contact with the foot- wall so far as it is explored. This is the best-developed vein we have observed in the hard rock. At the entrance of Todd's Harbor a belt of amygdaloid of a reddish-brown"], [173, "Ooc. No. 69. 143 color is observed dipping under the greenstone at an angle of 45\u00b0; and if the shafts are protracted to a sufficient depth, they will intersect it, when the vein will probably be found to undergo some modification. The company have sent to market 4,483 pounds of copper, which yielded 75 per cent, of pure copper. The mass of the veinstone, however, will not yield 10 per cent. The largest mass of native copper taken from this lode weighed about 700 pounds. The company now employ in and about the mine 26 men, who are pressing on the work vigorously, and with very fair prospects of success. Siskawit mine adjoins Rock Harbor, Isle Royale, and occurs on the southwest quarter of section 13, township 66, range 34. The vein bears nearly east and west, with an inclination of 75\u00b0 to the north. For forty feet in its downward course it cuts a belt of dark, granular trap, composed of hornblende, chlorite, and feldspar, after which it intersects a belt of columnar trap. While confined to the granular trap, the vein was well developed, and yielded considerable copper in masses and stamp- work ; but having entered the columnar trap, it contracted to a mere fissure, the vein stone and metallic contents disappearing. The subjoined sketch repre- sents the workings. Two shafts have been sunk through the chlorite trap, intersecting the columnar trap in one instance at the depth of 35 feet, and in the other at 40 feet. West from shaft No. 2, 1,800 feet, another shaft has been commenced. Fig. 28. The veinstone consists of calc-spar, chlorite, and epidote, with copper disseminated in small scales and points; also in masses, the largest of which observed by us weighed 350 pounds. This company have other tracts on the northern side of Isle Royale which contain veins, but, as they have been only partially explored, we will not pause to describe them. Ohio and Isle Royale Company.\u2014 The operations of the company are at present confined to testing a vein on the southeast quarter of section 34, township 66, range 34, about two miles' south of Rock Harbor, by the lake shore. Its course is northeast; its inclination, 6SC to the northwest. Thus, although its course is conformable to the axis of elevation, its incli nation cuts across the beds of rock. The vein is thirteen inches in width, composed of calc spar, quartz, and epidote, with native copper in thin sheets adhering to the hanging-wall, and disseminated through the gangue. An adit has been started n \u2022ar the water-level to intersect a shaft 25 feet deep, a short distance from the shore. The rock in which it is excavated is a dark-gray, granular trap. The W3lls are well defined, and the character of the rock is favorable. This belt, it was feared, would not prove sufficiently thick to afford ample room for working the vein. The veinstone contains from 8 to 12 per cent, of copper, which is suffi ciently rich to pay for mining."], [174, "144 Doc. No. 69. A small feeder comes into the vein on the left, about 15 feet from the entrance to the adit, at which point it presents the following section: Fig. 29. 1. Laumonte, 1 inch. 2. Epidote and quartz, with brecciated wall-rock con taining copper in bunches and disseminated, 13 inches. 3. Fragments of wall- rock, with strings of copper in the fissures, associated with the launaonite and epidote, 4 feet 3 inches. A few rods to the south is seen another vein about eight inches in width. The matrix consists ofdatholite, heavily charged with native copper. It is in a rock simi- lar in character to that above described, resting on which is a hard, crys talline greenstone. The vein, in its upward course, becomes contracted to a mere fissure, containing little copper, where it enters the incumbent greenstone. The following shafts have been sunk by this company, under the di rection of Mr. Douglass: One on the southeast quarter of section 22, township 66, range 34. At the depth of 20 feet, they intersected the columnar trap, a continuation of the belt described as occurring at the Siskawit mine. The vein in the upper belt was three feet wide, but after entering the columnar trap it rapidly contracted, and at the depth of 35 feet exhibited a mere seam a few lines in width. On section 2, township 65, range 34, a shaft was sunk 40 feet; at the depth of 10 feet a belt of sandstone was struck, which continued as far as the shaft was prosecuted, forming the foot-wait of the vein. On section 35, in the same township and range, a shaft was sunk to the depth of 90 feet. The formation dips to the southeast, while the vein in clines to the northwest. On section 10, township 65, range 34, a shaft was sunk to the depth <of 40 feet on a vein of epidote and datholite two feet in width. These shafts, at the time of our visit, were filled with water, and we were unable to gather exact information as to the character and produc tiveness of the several veins."], [175, "TABULAR STATEMENT or THE MINES IN THE LAKE SUPERIOR LAND DISTRICT, IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN 10"], [176, "146 Doc.

We have thus attempted to give, somewhat in detail, a description of the several mines now wrought in the Lake Superior land district. We have endeavored to exhibit the principal phenomena of the veins, their range, extent, and metallic contents. When it is considered that nearl^ the entire copper region is an unre claimed wilderness, the miners' settlements appearing like mere dots on its surface, covered with a dense growth of trees, through which the ex plorer with difficulty forces a path; and that, except where the streams have worn their beds in the rock, or the hills terminate in bold and crag gy ledges, the ground is covered with a thick carpet of mosses and lichens, effectually concealing every trace of veins, \u2014 it is surprising that such an amount of mineral wealth has been revealed within so short a period. This region had occasionally been traversed by the trapper, and the white man had coasted along its rock-bound shores, at intervals, for nearly two hundred years; but up to the year 1841, when Hough ton made his reconnaissance, we have no evidence that a really productive vein had been observed. To him is to be ascribed the credit of having first pronounced on the value of this region for mining purposes, and de lineated, with a graphic pen, its geological outlines. It is only about a year since the Minnesota mine, which is surpassed by slone in the region either in extent or productiveness, was developed. The same is true, to a great extent, of the North American. As the country becomes opened, and, the means for exploration become increased, new sources of mineral wealth will undoubtedly be revealed. There will be an increase in the products of these mines from year to year, until the national supply will exceed the national consumption. For certain purposes in the arts this copper stands unrivalled; in density and tenacity it surpasses all the ores of copper. Hence, in the manufacture of wire, where extreme ductility is required \u2014 in the manu facture of ordnance, where tenacity is the chief requisite \u2014 this copper .should be employed. It would be proper for the government, in con tracting for ordnance, with the double view of encouraging this branch of industry and securing an article made of the best material, to insert a stipulation that they be ceak from this copper.\" The same encouragement might be given in sheathing the national ships. This copper contains a small per centage of silver \u2014 too inconsiderable in most cases to justify separation, but the presence of which enhances the value of the copper, protecting it, in a considerable degree, from the corrosive action of salt water. These qualities, when known, will give it a preference in market over copper reduced from the ores. We have estimated the product of the copper mines for the year 1849 at 1,200 tons. For the ensuing year it may be safely rated at 2,000 tons; and a proportionate increase may be anticipated for several years to come. > How far the product of these mines will go towards supplying the home demand may be inferred from the following table, which exhibits pretty accurately (at least as much so as any statistics which are availa ble) the extent of that demand;"], [183, "Doc. No. 69. 153 Statement , furnished by the Register of the Treasury, exhibiting the value of copper unmanufactured annually imported during the ten years ending June 30, 1 849. By this statement it will be seen that the average value of copper an nually imported into the United States slightly exceeds $1,708,000. As suming the price of pig copper to be 18 cents per pound, and sheathings to be 22 cents, the annual consumption would be less than 5,000 tons. The product of the Lake Superior mines for fife year 1851 will probably reach one-half of this amount, or 2,500 tons. There is a limit to the produc tiveness of all mines; for, when once fairly opened, their exploitation be comes more expensive the farther it is prosecuted. That limit has not been attained by any of the mines of Lake Superior. We have endeavored in the subsequent pages of this chapter to bring together a mass of statistical information with regard to the products of mines in different countries, which may be useful for reference to those engaged in public pursuits, as well as the general reader. * Old copper included with copper in pigs.

The productiveness of these mines is yearly increas ing, and the relative preponderance of Great Britain is yearly diminishing. France, whose mines are conducted with the most consummate skill, occupies the next place on the list. Our own country abounds in mineral wealth. Our coal-fields, occupy ing portions of fourteen States, 'comprehend an area of 130,000 square miles. Associated with them are extensive beds of iron, rivalling in richness those of Shropshire and Wales. Numerous furnaces and foundries have already sprung up along the lines of their out crop, giving employ ment to a large number of operatives. The high price of labor and the remoteness of the beds from the seaboard have operated to depress this branch of business, which employs a capital of more than $20,000,000. The Silurian limestones of the West, while they support a soil of great fertility, yield an amount of lead beyond the national consumption. \"The number of persons directly dependent on mining operations in Great Britain is estimated at 1,000,000 : 193,000 are actually employed in the mines."], [185, "Doc. No. 69. 155 The value of the copper mines and their influence on the national wealth, we have attempted to set forth. The richness and extent of the gold tracts of California surpass all of our previous knowledge of this class of deposites, and seem sabulous rather than real. It is to this region, also, that we can confidently look for a supply -of quicksilver. The zinc ores of New Jersey are beginning to be advantageously wrought. It is extremely difficult to obtain a correct statement of the mining inter est of the United States, as there is no statistical bureau to which those interested in this branch of industry are required to make returns. The census returns hitherto have been very imperfect. The following table can be regarded only as an approximation to the value of metals annually raised in the United States : Gold $40,000,000 Iron ..... 16,500,000 Lead 2,400.000 Copper ----- 750,000 Mercury* .... 500,000? $60, 150, 000 The mining interest of this country is in its infancy. If the products of the California mines are as great as has been represented by those who have had the best opportunities for acquiring information, the United States at the present time is the most prolific in metallic wealth of any of the nations of the earth. The great chain of the Andes is protracted beyond the northern limits of Oregon, though on a scale less magnificent than in South America. It is composed essentially of the same rocks; and we may therefore confidently expect to find a recurrence of the same mineral products which characterize it in Peru and Chili. Thus far, in regard to its mineral wealth, it may be regarded as comparatively unexplored. To show the products of the mines in different countries, we have prepared the annexed table, from the most authentic sources within our reach. With regard to the South American mines, our materials are very deficient. The unstable character of the governments, the imperfection of the custom-house returns, and the amount of precious metals annually smuggled out of those countries, all render these statistics little better than estimates. The mineral produce of China is undoubtedly great; but it is all consumed within her own borders, and has, therefore, no effect upon the market. The same remark is applicable to other Asiatic coun tries. *It is said that the quicksilver mines of California are now yielding a profit of *3,000 daily, but we apprehend that this statement must be received with many grains of allowance,."], [186, "Doc.

CHAPTER V. ANCIENT MINING. Evidence of ancient mining, excavations, implements. \u2014 High antiquity to be ascribed lo them. \u2014 Whether they can be traced to the mound- builders. \u2014 Ancient works at the Minnesota mines. \u2014 At the Forest mine. \u2014 Nature of the materials found in the pits. \u2014 Bones. \u2014 Evidences of tumuli. \u2014 Extent of these xoor kings in the Ontonagon region.\u2014 On Keweenaw Point.\u2014 On Isle Royale.\u2014 May they not be traced to the aborigines ? That this region was resorted to by a barbaric race for tbe purpose of procuring copper, long before it became known to the white man, is evident from numerous memorials scattered throughout its entire extent. Whether these ancient miners belonged to the race who built the mounds found so abundantly on the Upper Mississippi and its affluents, or were the progenitors of the Indians now inhabiting the country, is a matter of conjecture. When all of the facts shall have been collected, the question may be satisfactorily determined. The evidence of the early mining consists in the existence of numerous excavations in the solid rock; of heaps of rubble and earth along the courses of the veins; of the remains of copper utensils fashioned into the form of knives and chisels; of stone hammers, some of which are of immense size and weight; of wooden bowls for bailing water from the mines; and numerous levers of wood used in raising the mass copper to the surface. The high antiquity of this rude mining is inferred from the fact that the existing race of Indians have no tradition, by what people or at what period it was done. -The places, even, were unknown to the oldest of the band until pointed out by the white man . It is inferred from the character of the trees growing upon the piles of rubbish \u2014 between which and thos<> forming the surrounding forest no perceptible difference can be detected\u2014 from the mouldering state of the wooden billets and levers, and from the na ture of the materials with which these excavations are filled, consisting of fine clay, enveloping half-decayed leaves, and the bones of the bear, the deer, and the caribou. This filling up resulted, not from the action of temporary streamlets, but from the slow accumulations of years. Traces of tumuli, constructed in the form of mathematical figures, have been observed, but not sufficiently explored to determine absolutely whether they be the work of art, and, if so, for what purposes they were intended. It is well known that copper rings, designed for bracelets, are frequently met with in the western mounds. We have several of these relics in our possession. There is no evidence that the race by whom those structures were built possessed sufficient knowledge of the metallurgic art to reduce and purify the ores of copper. Admitting that they did, should we not natu rally refer to this region, instead of seeking a more remote one, as the source from which these materials were derived? Are not these copper"], [189, "Doc. No. 69. 159 rings a strong link in the chain of evidence to connect the ancient mining of this region with the earth-works of the Mississippi valley? We will now proceed to the details of the discoveries thus far made. The most extended excavations are found in thevicinity of the Ontonagon river; and to Mr. Samuel O. Knapp, the intelligent agent of the Minnesota Company, belongs the credit of having first laid before the public an ac count of their nature and extent. In the winter of 1847-'48, while passing over a portion of the lo- cation now occupied by iJAe Minnesota Mining Company, he observed a continuous depression in the soil, which he rightly conjectured was caused by the disentegration of a vein. There was a bed of snow on the ground three feet in depth, but it had been so little disturbed by the wind that it conformed to the inequalities of the surface. Following up these indica- tions along the southern escarpment of the hill, where the company's works are now erected, he came to a longitudinal cavern, into which he crept, after having dispossessed several porcupines which had selected it as a place of hybernation. He saw numerous evidences to convince him that this was an artificial excavation, and at a subsequent day, with the assistance of two or three men, proceeded to explore it. In clearing out the rubbish they found numerous stone hammers, showing plainly that they were the mining implements of a rude race. At the bottom of the ex- cavation they found a vein with ragged projections of copper, which the an- cient miners had not detached. This point is east of the present works. The following spring he explored some of the excavations to the west, where one of the shafts of the mine is now sunk. The depression was twenty-six feet deep, filled with clay and a matted mass of mouldering vegetable matter. When he had penetrated to the depth of eighteen feet, he came to a mass of native copper ten feet, long, three feet wide, and nearly two feet thick, and weighing over six tons. On digging around it the mass was found to rest on billets of oak, supported by sleepers of the same material. This wood, specimens of which we have preserved, by its long exposure to moisture, is dark-colored, and has lost all of its con- sistency. A knife-blade may be thrust into it as easily as into a peat-bog. The earth was so packed around the copper as to give it a firm support. The ancient miners had evidently raised it about five feet and then aban- doned the work as too laborious. They had taken off every projecting point which was accessible, so that the exposed surface was smooth. Be- low this the vein was subsequently found filled with a sheet of copper five feet thick, and of an undetermined extent vertically and longitudinally. The position of the copper block, and the extent of the exploitations along a portion of the lode, may be seen by reference to the plan of the Minnesota mine, on page 133. The vein was wrought in the form of an open trench; and where the copper was the most abundant, there the ex- cavations extended the deepest. The trench is generally filled to within afoot of the surface, with the wash from the surrounding surface inter- mingled with leaves nearly decayed. The rubbish taken from the mine is piled up in mounds, which can readily be distinguished from the former contour of the ground. ."], [190, "Doc. No. 69 160 A few rods to the west is another specimen of ancient mining, where Fig. 30. they have left a portion of the veinstone standing, in the form of a pillar, in order to support the hanging wall. The rubbish in this excavation has not been cleared away, so that its extent is unknown. These evidences are observed on this location for a distance of two and a half miles. Upon a mound of earth we saw a pine stump, broken fifteen feet from the ground, ten feet in circumference, which must have grown, flourished, and died since the earth in which it had taken root was thrown out. Mr. Knapp counted three hundred and ninety-five annular rings oh a hemlock, growing under similar circumstances, whch he felled near one of his shafts. Thus it would appear that these exploitations were made before Columbus started on his voyage of discovery. The amount of ancient hammers found in this vicinity exceeded ten cart-loads, and Mr. K., with little reverence for the past, employed a por tion of them in walling up a spring. They are made of greenstone or porphyry pebbles, with a groove, single or double, cut around, by which a withe was attached. The following is a sketch of one of the larger class, the dimensions of which were 12x5ijX4 inches, and the weight 39\u00a3 pounds. The smaller class, weighing five or six pounds, were probably wielded in one hand. The annexed sketch will convey an idea of their form. In addition to these relics, a copper gad, with the head much battered, and a copper chisel, with a socket for the reception of a handle, were brought to light. It contained the fragment of a wooden handle, when dis covered, which crumbled very soon after being exposed. The timber in the excavation before described showed the marks of an axe, the bit of which must have been about two inches in width. Mr. Wm. H. Stevans, the agent of the Forest minf, has discovered other workings on the southwest quarter of section 30, township 50, range 39, almost of equal extent and interest. They occur on the southern slope Fig. 31"], [191, "Doc. No. 69. 161 of a hill, and consist of a series of pits, some of which, on being opened, are found to be fourteen feet deep. They are arranged in four lines, fol lowing the courses of four veins or feeders. In cleaning out one of these pits, at the depth of *n feet the workmen came across a fragment of a wooden bowl, which, from the splintry pieces of rock and gravel imbedded in its rim, must have been employed in bailing water. Remnants of charcoal were found, not only there, but at numerous places, lying on the surface of the rock. Some have supposed that fires were kindled for the purpose of melting the copper, but the more reason able supposition is that heat was employed to destroy the cohesion between the copper and the rock. Before the introduction of gunpowder, sire was the great agent in excavating rock; and even now, in the Harz aud at Al tenberg, two of the old mining districts of Europe, this agent is employed to break down rocks of extreme hardness. It is quite as economical where fuel abounds as gunpowder in destroying silicious rocks. We can hardly conceive it possible for them to have made such exten sive excavations with such implements simply as they have left behinc , without availing themselves of the aid of sire. In one of these pits \u2014 southwest quarter of section 35, township 51, range 38 \u2014 were found the bones of a deer, in a pretty good state of preser vation. Fragments of the cranium, humerus, and of one horn (which, to use the language of sportsmen, was in the \"velvet\" at the time of the destruction of the animal) were taken out. The smaller bones had mouldered away. They reposed on clay, a foot above the surface of the pit, and were covered with accumulations of clay, leaves, gravel, and sand to the depth of nineteen feet. It would appear that the animal either fell into the pit or ventured in to procure water, and, unable to ex tricate himself, perished. These pits, silled as they were with water, would not become the' dens of carniverous animals, and to no agency of theirs are we to attribute the position of these bones. In the northeast quarter of section 16, township 50, range 39. near a small stream, there is a mound which has the appearance ot having been the work of art. Mr. Hill, from whose notes much of the above information has been derived, states that from the want of tools he was unable to penetrate it, to de termine whether it was stratified or not. It is about ten feet high, in the form of a square, the sides of which are fifteen feet in length, fiat on the top, and slope regularly to the base. Fig. 32. There is another tumulus on the right bank of the Ontonagon river, six miles above its mouth, forty feet high, and nearly circular, which has been supposed to be artificial, but has not been explored with a view t\u00ae determine the point. From the northeast quarter of section 31, township 51, range 37, to section 5, township 49, range 40, a distance of nearly thirty miles, there is almost a continuous line of ancient pits along the middle range of trap, though they are not exclusively confined to it. Upon Keweenaw Point they have been found extending from Eagle river eastward to range 28, a distance of twelve miles, along the base of the trap range. A great number of hammers were discovered on the 11"], [192, "162 Doc. No. 69. present site of the Northwest Company's works, which first led the ex plorers to suspect the existence of a valuable lode of copper. They have also been found at the Copper Falls mine, and at the Ph\u0153nix, formerly the Lake Superior, mine. At the latter place a copper knife was discov ered, in the early explorations of that tract. Mr. C. G. Shaw pointed out to us similar evidences of mining on Isle Royale. They occur on what is known as the Middle Finger, and can be traced lengthwise for the distance of a mile. Mr. Shaw remarks that, on opening one of these pits, which had become filled up with the sur rounding earth, he found the mine had been worked through the solid rock to \"the depth of nine feet, the walls being perfectly smooth. At the bottom he found a vein of native copper eighteen inches thick, including a sheet of pure copper lying against the foot- wall. The workings appear to have been effected simply by stone hammers and wedges, specimens of which were found in great abundance at the bottom of the pits. He found no metallic implements of any description, and is convinced, from the appearance of the wall-rocks, the substances removed, and the multitude of hammers found, that the labor of exca vating the rock must have been performed only with the instruments above named, with the aid perhaps of fire. From the appearance of the vein and the extent of the workings, he conjectures that an immense amount of labor had been expended. He endeavored to find some evidences of the antiquity of these workings, but could discover nothing very sat isfactory to his own mind, except that they were made at a remote epoch. The vegetable matter had accumulated and filled up the entire opening to a level with the surrounding surface; and, in a regkta where it accumu lates as slowly as it does on the barren and rocky parts of Isle Royale, this filling up would have been the work of centuries. Upon this vege table accumulation he found trees growing equal in size to any in the vicinity. All will admit that the facts above set forth assign to these excavations a high antiquity; but whether they were made by a race distinct from the Indians now inhabiting the region, is a matter of extreme doubt, although all traditions with regard to their origin have perished. A race like the Indians, dependent principally on hunting and fishing for the means of subsistence, would employ copper, where it was accessi ble, in the construction of their weapons of capture, in preference to stone, it being more easily fashioned and less destructible. This would naturally be expected in the rudest and most simple state of society. Among the earliest benefits derived from their contact with the whites would be the introduction of iron implements, which would soon super sede those of copper. They then would have no interest in maintaining a communication with the copper region, which abounded in few animals of the chase, or in preserving among their tribe a knowledge of the places from which the metal was obtained. The lapse of a century or two would obliterate all traditions. We have seen that the first missiona- ries arrived on the borders of Lake Superior as early as 1641, and it is probable that the tribes which they there found had established an inter course Ayith the whites at Quebec and Montreal years before. If, from the scanty records of \\h<>. Jesuits, we could gather what amount of skill was displayed by the savages in the art of making metallic implements, and the kind of material used, it would throw much light upon this point."], [193, "Doc. No. 69. 163 Skulls form the most distinguishing feature between the several tribes \u2022\u00abf the human family; and hence their discovery \u2014 which may be looked for among these excavations\u2014 will afford authentic testimony of the character of the race by which they were made. Note. \u2014 According to Kaloi, (Reise, th. 3, s. 416,) M. de Verandrier, who in 1746 was sent \u2022upon an overland expedition intended to reach the Pacific, by Chevalier de Beauharnois, then governor-jreneral of Canada, in the prairies 900 miles west of Montreal, found enormous masses -of stone, placed in an upright position by the hand of man, and on one of them was some thing which was taken to be a Tartar inscription. It was engraved on a small tablet which had been let into a pillar of cut stone, in which position it was found. Some of the Jesuits in the city of Quebec assured Kalm that they had seen and handled the supposed inscription. It was afterwards transmitted to Count Maurepas, in France. Humboldt, from whom we derive this information, ( Aspects of Nature, title Steppes and Annotations,) add\u00bb: \" I have asked several of my friends in France to search out this monument, in case it should really be in existence, and in the collection of Count Maurepas, but without success.\" May not this carved stone have been the work of the old copper-miners? Verandrier further affirmed that, throughout entire days' journeys, traces of the ploughshare were discernible; but Humboldt remarks that \" the total ignorance of the primitive nations of America with regard to this agricultural implement, the want of draught cattle, and the great extent of ground over which the supposed furrows are found, all lead to the conjecture that the singular appearance has been produced by some effects ot water on the surface.\" The surface of- the ishnd of Maekinac, which lay in their route, presents the appearance of a ploughed field. It arises from the removal of blocks of stone from their place of bedding in the strata by the agency of water, during the drift epoch. The earth is not evenly distributed, but lies in ridges like graves, and well might be mistaken for the remains of aboriginal tillage."], [194, "\\6i Doc. No. 69. CHAPTER VI. VEINS AND VEINSTONES. The occurrence of copper in different parts of the earth. \u2014 Geological asso- ciation. \u2014 Definition of veins. \u2014 Different systems. \u2014 Length, width, and underlie.\u2014 Their gangues and the changes which they undergo in their passage through different mineral planes. \u2014 Formatitn of veins. \u2014 Ma- terials composing their gangws, and the order of arrangement .\u2014 Comby structure. \u2014 Position of the silver and of the moss copper. \u2014 Veins of native copper, an anomaly. \u2014 Various hypotheses as lo the mode of filling.\u2014 Injection.\u2014 Sublimation.\u2014 Electro-chemical agency.- Universal diffusion of magnetism, and its influence on the combinations of matter. Before entering upon the detailed description of the phenomena of the veins of the Lake Superior district, it would be proper to consider the conditions under which copper occurs in other portions of the earth, and thus afford the means of comparing this newly-discovered district with those in which veins have been wrought for centuries. We shall then be able to appreciate the peculiar, and we may say Unique, character of the Lake Superior district, and arrive at some general conclusions as to the degree of importance to be attached to the facts developed in the progress of the explorations. -It must not be forgotten how short a \u00a3ime has elapsed since the first attempts at mining were made, and the physical obstacles which had to he overcome before the business was established on a firry basis. Al though on the eastern continent mines have been wrought from time im memorial, and every year has added some new facts to the mass already collected, yet the theory of veins, their detailed structure, and the re lation of the various ores to their gangues and the enclosing walls can only be said to be imperfectly understood in those districts where the most skill and science have been devoted to their investigation. It cannot, then, be expected that we shall be able to solve the various problems pre sented in the investigation of so complex a subject in a district where mining explorations have been darned on only a few years, and where a small portion of our time only could be devoted to the collection of the facts brought to light. The occurrence in this district of powerful veins of native copper in igneous rocks is a deviation from the general rules found to prevail else where. They are confined, as we have seen from the detailed geology, to the btdded trap, while the rocks of the preceding epoch \u2014 for instance, as at the Prince mine, Mamainse, and other places on the Canada shore, where the greenstones have flowed over the slates\u2014 are characterized by the presence of veins of the sulphurets. In referring to the conditions under which copper occurs in other re gions, we will commence with Cornwall \u2014 a district best known to the American miner. This district furnishes all of the tin and seven-eighths of the copper mined in Great Britain. There are about 112 veins wrought,"], [195, "Doc. No. 69. 165 at an annual expense of .\u00a3900,000. The rock in which they are princi pally developed is clay slate, or killas, as it is termed by the Cornish mi ners, constituting the base of the Silurian system, among which the gran ites and elvans have been protruded. The ores are the yellow sulphuret of copper and iron, with which are associated, in the undecomposed part of the vein, black sulphuret, red oxide, and native copper. The gangue of the cupriferous veins is almost exclusively quartz. The average of the ore raised does not probably exceed two and one-half per cent, but by dress ing it is brought up to eight per cent. France at present affords but one workable mine of copper. Numerous mines have been wrought at various periods, but at this time they are abandoned. In the Vosges, the copper veins are associated with the argillaceous slates of the carboniferous era, among which porphyritic rocks have been protruded. The celebrated mines of Chessy, in central France, are at the junction of the granite and lias. Germany. \u2014 In the Harz mountains, the copper veins, with quartzose gangues, occur in gran-waeke slate, with intercalated belts of trappean rocks. The product of these mines does not exceed 300 tons. The mines of Rheinbreitenbach, in the same formation, are productive in pyri tous and variegated copper, accompanied by a gangue entirely quartzose. In -the vicinity of Mansfeld, in Prussia, occurs the interesting deposite known as the \"kupferschiefer,\" or copper slate \u2014 a thin layer in the zech stein, throughout the whole thickness of which is disseminated gray ar gentiferous copper ore, yielding about 2.L per cent. Near Schemnitz, in Hungary, is an interesting metalliferous region, which produces about 5,000 tons of copper annually, together with gold, silver, antimony, and other metals. The veins are included inpofphyritic rocks, which are connected with sienites, passing into granites. The pre dominating, gangues are quartz and sulphate of baryta; the ores, pyritous and gray eopper. Spain. \u2014 The general character of the deposites of the metals in Spain is similar to those of the Harz. The amount of copper raised is trifling, compared with that of lead and mercury. Norway and Sweden. \u2014 The sulphuret of copper and iron is almost the only ore obtained from the Scandinavian mines, and is very meagre, rarely exceeding 3 or 4 per cent. The Norwegian copper is highly esteemed, in consequence of its freedom from arsenic and other metals. The veins are principally confined to the gneiss and mica slate. The famous mine of Fahuln, now nearly exhausted, occurs in the latter rock. From 1S38 to 1843, the Norwegian and Swedish mines did not yield over 1,500 tons of pure copper. Russia. \u2014 The Russian copper deposites in the Ural mountains are re markable for the purity and richness of the ores, with which is associa ted considerable native copper. They have been compared to the veins of Lake Superior, but between the two districts there are few points of analogy. The most productive mines are those of Tourinsk and Nijny iagilsk. The chief mining-ground at the last-named places is a broken and un consolidated mass of detritus, containing thin veins and nests of mala chite. It lies in the depressions worn in the surface of the upturned edges of the limestone strata belonging to the upper portion of the Silurian"], [196, "166 Doc. No. 69. rocks, among which are intermixed broken ridges of amphrbole rock. The malachite is unquestionably a secondary product, resulting from a cupriferous solution, deposited in a stalagmite form. Such is the charac ter of the Russian deposites. Cuba. \u2014 The average product imported to England from 1843 to 1847 was 5,400 tons of pure copper \u2014 the average yield of the ore being a little over 16 per cent. The copper deposites of Santiago are highly productive. The ores are not in regular veins, but in beds and masses, subordinate to the igneous rocks, especially greenstone and serpentine. The gangues are quartz, dolomite, and carbonate of lime. The yellow sulphurets are associated with the hydrated oxide of iron. Native copper is also observed in this connexion. The presence of native silver in the blue carbon ate of copper is by no means rare. Chili. \u2014 The average quantity of copper smelted in Wales, from the ores and black metal from this source, from 1843 to 1847, was 4,400 tons. The average yield of the ore and black metal was 31.15 per cent. The copper veins are exceedingly numerous and powerful, and exist in the granite. The gangues are quartzose and jaspery. Australia. \u2014 These mines, though worked but a few years, are daily rising in importance. The geological association of the rocks is similar to those of Cornwall. Hills of mica slate compose the Barrossa district; and distorted clay slate, like the killas of Cornwall, is seen in the Adaline district. Through these the granites andsienites have protruded. The ores of copper are abundant, consisting of the red oxide and sulphurets. From the verbal communications of Sir John Richardson, we infer that the analogy between the Lake Superior deposites and those of the Copper mine river is very marked. The rocks consist of bedded trap and sand stone, with occasional layers of limestone, traversed by veins containing native copper and malachite. It will thus be seen that the ores of copper are confined to no particular position in the geological column, but range from the has to the granite. Veins are the principal repositories of most of the valuable metals em ployed in the arts, and, whether observed in the Ural or the Harz, in Cornwall or on the borders of Lake Superior, exhibit certain features in common \u2014 showing that their formation is due to the operation of gen eral laws. They are almost always found associated with the igneous and meta morphic rocks; but where they occur in rocks purely detrital, the igneous rocks are generally found not far temoved. It is, therefore, to igneous agency that we are to attribute the formation of fissures and the seggre gation of their metallic products. Mr. Came remarks: \" By a true vein, I understand the mineral con tents of a vertical or inclined fissure, nearly straight, and of indefinite length and depth.\" Werner, the great Saxon geologist, defined veins as \" mineral reposito ries, of a flat or tubular shape, which traversed the strata without regard to stratification, having the appearance of rents or fissures formed in the rocks, and afterwards filled up with mineral matter which differed more or less from the rocks themselves.\" A true vein, therefore, may be defined as a fissure in the solid crust of the earth, of indefinite length and depth, which has been filled more or less perfectly with mineral substances, introduced by various agencies."], [197, "Doc. No. 69. 167 subsequent to the formation of the fissure. They differ essentially from beds, which are generally contemporaneous with the formation in which they are enclosed, and range and dip with the associated rocks. This distinction cannot in all cases be recognised, since mineral deposites some times present characteristics common to both. Every mining district exhibits certain systems of veins, which differ from each other in age, and often in their mineral contents. In Cornwall, three sets have been observed, which have been desig nated by certain provincial appellations well understood: 1st. The system of right running veins, which traverse the country in a direction nearly .east and west. Mr. Henwood found, as the mean of 3' 0 observations, that the right-running veins containing metalliferous ores bore 4\u00b0 north of east and south of west. Another set, called contras, intersect the main veins at an angle of 45\u00b0; and still another set, called cross-courses, intersect the right-running veins at nearly right angles. The first system is the most ancient, be cause it is always traversed by the other two; they are the older tin veins. Tire next are those which contain tin and copper. The third are the east-and-west veins, which are the most recent and the most productive of copper.* These veins vary from one to four feet in width. They ordinarily ex teud-a few thousand feet, and some even a mile; the great vein of the United mines has been, however, traced to the distance of eight miles. The direction of the principal veins in Mexico \u2014 for instance, the Veta Grande and Veta Madre \u2014 is northwest and southeast, and they are exhibited on a scale of grandeur unknown in the mining districts of Europe. Thus the Vela Madre has been traced continuously on the surface for more than six miles, and expands in places to the enormous width \u00abf ninety feet. In the Cerro de Pasco, Peru, noted for its silver ores, one set of veins, according to Tschudi, bears north and south, which is intersected by another set bearing east southeast aud west-northwest. The Veta de Colquirica has been traced to the distance of nine thousand six hun- dred feet, and it expands to the width of four hundred and twelve feet. This belongs to the first-mentioned class. The Veta, de Panarirca, which belongs to the second class, is known to extend six thousand four hundred sent in length, and three hundred and eighty feet in breadth. From these large veins, numerous small ones branch off in various direc- tions, forming a complete network ofeilver beneath the surface. A vein of two or three feet in width can probably be as economically wrought as one of much greater expansion; the ores are more concen- trated, and the expense of securing the work by timbers is proportionately less. Veins of Keweenaw Point . \u2014 On Keweenaw Point, one system of veins is well defined. Their bearing is north of west \u2014 the mean of several ob- servations giving north 21-^\u00b0 west. So true is this, that no permanently productive vein has been discovered thus far which varied 15\u00b0 from this course, which is at nearly right angles to the formation, or axis of uphea val. These veins, in their downward course, deviate more or less from a perpendicular, amounting to 8\u00b0 or 10\u00b0, or even 12J. They also expand * Anstead on Mining, Lecture XV."], [198, "168 Doc. No. 69. and contract at short intervals, which results from the lateral and vertical dislocations to which the walls have been subjected. The Cliff vein affords an illustration of this kind, a section of which is subjoined: Fig. 33. o. Wal's nearly in contact. 6.

Veinstone, breccmte'l ; east layer only seen pinched and much inclined. d- East layer now seen. /. Vein perpendicular, and expanding in width. Not more than one half of the east comb is represented hi the fissure. The miners call it a \"splice in the vein.\" These splices will be found to occur wherever the vein becomes nearly vertical. They fill the vein just above the points where the walls nearly come in contact, and run out on the overhanging wall, leaving the west comb to occupy the more inclined and contracted parts of the fissure. The brecciated veinstone is al ways found just above the points where the walls nearly come in contact. These expansions and contractions in the vein re sult from a vertical dislocation of the enclosing walls. If apiece of paper be cut in a waving, irregular line, and one part slipped beyond the other, it will represent pretty correctly the irregularities of a vein. The surfaces of the fissure, or rather the walls, are polished and striated, resulting from the repeated slippings of the mass. Veins m the Ontonagon region. \u2014 A different system of veins prevails here. The veins run with the formation, instead of catting it at right angles, like those of Keweenaw Point. In the St. Agnes, Gwennap, Red ruth, and Camborne districts, in Cornwall, 'according to De la Beche, the general coincidence of the lines of bearing of the tin and copper lodes with the lines ot eivans is particularly remarkable. In describing the peculiarities of the trappean rocks, we stated that whenever they approached the detrital rocks, as a general thing, they as sumed a stratiform appearance; and this remark is applicable to this re gion. The fissures appear to have been formed along these lines, and correspond in bearing and underlie to the bearing and dip of the asso ciated sedimentary rocks. Of this class of veins, the Douglass Houghton, the Forest, and the Minnesota are marked examples. Some have supposed, from the coinci dence in-the bearing and underlie mi these fissures with those of the sedi mentary rocks, that they were of contemporaneous origin \u2014 in fact, that they were simply beds. We do not, however, regard them in this light. Take, for example, the Minnesota vein. The walls are polished and striated, and the mineral matter composing the gangue is distinct in char acter from the enclosing rock. The vein exhibits numerous strings and feeders, and., wherever these intersect it, marks of derangement are ob servable. The veinstone is arranged in combs, like that of the vertical fissures. These peculiari,;es are sufficiently marked to justify us in re- garding them as true vein; There is another class -'V-irwp rnm-o and underlie corres- pond to the course and dip gard them as beds, contc differ from the fissures la We re tted rocks. They is ; They are im-"], [199, "Doc. No. 69. 169 perfectly defined, there being no clear lines of junction with the walls; are very irregular in their course, exhibiting nothing like parallelism for a considerable distance; and the mineral matter with which the copper is as sociated is never arranged in combs or lamellar plates. They are known as \"epidote veins,\" the gangue consisting of epidote and quartz, with native copper. They appear to be the result of seggregation, rather than injection, and are as rich at the surface as at any given depth. This class of beds is generally associated with the quartzose porphyries of the re gion west of the Ontonagon river and the Porcupine mountains. Numerous explorations of these beds have been made, but in no in stance successfully. The quartzose porphyries are also traversed by a set of narrow irregu lar fissures, nearly vertical, filled in with quartz, and for the most part barren of copper. In this connexion, we may mention still another class of deposites. Between the trappean and detrital rocks is often interposed a bed of chlo rite, three or four feet in width, through which copper is found dissemi nated in small bunches. The Union mine, now abandoned, on the Little Iron river, at the base of the Porcupine mountains, is an illustration of this kind. Veins of Isle Royale. \u2014 The veins of Isle Royale are more complicated than those of the districts we have before described. There are several systems, but the explorations have not been sufficient to enable us to de termine their relative ages. One system of veins bears nearly east and west, corresponding with the bearing of the associated sedimentary rocks; but while the former dip to the northwest at an angle of 75\u00b0, the latter dip to the south-south east at an angle of 12c or 14\u00b0. To this class belong the Siskawit ctnd Scovill vein and the Duncan vein, on section 34, township 66, range 34, on the lease of the Ohio and Isle Royale company. Another class may be appropriately called beds, having a bearing and dip conformable to those of the detrital rocks. This class is seen near the head of Rock Harbor, and at a place on the southern shore of the island which bears the classical appellation of Epidote. There is another system of fissures which run nearly north and south, at right angles with the axis of elevation, and dip from 10\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 to the east. To this class may be referred the vein now wrought by the Pitts burg and Isle Royale Company at Todd's Harbor, and the powerful vein on Phelps's island, at the outlet of Washington Harbor. Numerous fis sures holding the same course may be seen between Siskawit bay and Rock Harbor. Few veins exhibit their true character on the surface, which arises probably from the oxidation of the materials composing the gangue. Owing to the nature of the country, it is impossible to trace the veins con tinuously for any considerable distance; but we have satisfied ourselves that some continue six, and even eight miles. They rarely exceed four feet in width. The average width of the best veins thus far developed does not exceed two feet. Few faults have as yet been observed to interrupt their continuity. Having thus endeavored to define the different systems of veins in this region, we will next consider their gangues, or materials composing the"], [200, "170 Doc. No. 69. veinstone, as well as the changes which they undergo in their passage through different rocks. The gangues of veins deserve to be closely scrutinized by the miner, since a knowledge of their peculiarities is of great practical importance in enabling him to judge of the probable productiveness of a vein. The gangues of the most productive veins in this region consist of an admix ture of calc-spar, chlorite, epidote, laumonite, and drusy quartz. Prehnite, fluor spar, analcime, datholite, mesotype, apophyllite, and tahle-spar are occasionally met with; but their presence may be regarded as accidental. In no instance has a purely spar vein been found productive. The same remark will apply to the quartz veins. In other countries, the miner judges of the character of the lode by the character of the veinstone. Thus, in Cornwall, above the veins where rich deposites of copper occur is a mass of ferruginous matter, called by the miners gossan. In the Harz, a red oxide of iron, known as chapeau de fer, caps the lead and silver ores, and when struck affords the miner almost unerring indications of the proximity of rich deposites. It is deemed unnecessary here to describe the character of the vein stones with more minuteness, inasmuch as detailed information will be found under the appropriate head in the Table of Mines. The productiveness of a vein is also influenced by the character of the enclosing rock. Where it exists in the greenstone or hard crystalline rock, it is pinched; where it enters the soft porous amygdaloid, it becomes scat tered and ill defined; and in its passage through a belt of conglomerate, it almost always ceases to be metalliferous. The most favorable rock \u2014 that in which a vein is best developed \u2014 is a granular trap, with occasional amygdules scattered through it of a lively color, and possessing a good degree of firmness. This kind of rock belongs to the bedded trap. No veins of native copper have been found except in this association. The influence of the enclosing rock upon the productiveness of a vein, and the change in its mineral contents in passing through different belts of rock, have been observed in other regions. \"Granite, or its modification, elvan,\" remarks De la Beche, in his Survey of Cornwall, \"is found near all the localities where tin and copper ores so abound as to be worked and produce good mines; while lead, antimony, manganese, iron, and zinc are discovered in sufficient quanti ties to be profitably raised at a distance from granite or elvan. As far as the two counties of Cornwall and Devon are concerned, the conditions favorable for tin and copper ores seem unfavorable for those of lead. Valuable mines in the granite become worthless when they pass into the slates.\" In the Harz, according to M. Fournet, veins passing from argillaceous slate into cherry slate lose their productive character. Hard granites, as a general thing, are less prolific than the soft decomposed kinds. To show the changes which veins undergo in their passage through different beds of rock in this district, a few examples will be cited. We have described the range of hills in which the Cliff and North American mines are situated as composed of crystalline greenstone at the summit, and a granular trap, somewhat amygdaloidal, at the base. The same remark will apply to the Northwest and Northwestern mines. In"], [201, "Doc. No. 69. 171 the greenstone the veins are contracted and barren, but on entering the granular trap they become expanded and give evidence at once of their true character. At the Copper Falls mine, the vein in the northern trap belt was well defined and productive; but on entering the belt of sandstone to the south, it contracted to a mere fissure. This helt was perforated, but the miners did not succeed in recovering the vein in the southern trap belt. (Vide section of the works in the chapter on mines.) Mr. Hill traced a vein which appears near the lake shore by Copper Harbor through successive belts of conglomerate and trap, and thus describes the changes: This vein is on sections 25 and 36, township 59, range 29, and township 5S, range 29. It is distinctly marked on the.sur face through the above-named sections, and can be examined every few yards on the line of bearing. It varies but little in its general course from north to south, and underlies slightly to the east. Its width in the. first belt of sandstone and conglomeraie is two feet, and its gangue consists of calc-spar, with some native copper. Its width in the first trap belt is 14 inches, and its gangue consists of calc-spar and laumonite, with native copper disseminated. In the main range of conglomerate it expands to* two and a half feet, and is filled in with calc-spar, and exhibits no trace of copper. The large spar vein known as the \"Green Rock\" among the early voy ageurs, which strikes the shore at Hays's Point, Copper Harber, is un doubtedly a continuation of the black oxide vein a few rods east of Fort Wilkins. In the first conglomerate belt, the spar was associated with the green and blue silicates of copper. In the second conglomerate belt, it contained, in addition to the silicates, large masses of black oxide of copper. In the bottom of the harbor, when the water is tranquil, a spar vein, destitute of copper, is seen in the included trap, corresponding to the direction of the vein in the conglomerate on either side. Thus there can be little doubt that the veins of Keweenaw Point traverse different mineral planes, and, in their passage through them, un dergo marked changes in their gangues and metallic contents. On Isle Royale, the veins exhibit the same changes. Mr. Shaw sank a shaft on a vein, above Scovill's Point, to the depth of ninety six feet. For thirty feet the rock was soft, in which the vein was well developed, expanding in places to four feet in width, and containing considerable cop per. At that depth a band of columnar trap was struck and penetrated to the depth of sixty-six feet. The vein contracted to a foot in width, and was nearly barren and worthless. Mr. Whittlesey , the former agent of the Siskawit mine, informed us that, at their works, the columnar trap was intersected at the depth of thirty five feet; that the vein was well exposed in the overlying amygdaloidal trap, but that on entering the columnar trap it narrowed to a mere fissure. The same results followed the explorations on section 27, township 66, range 34, belonging to the Ohio and Isle Royale Company. On section 33, township 67, range 33, a vein bearing north 50\u00b0 east, the gangue of which consists of quartz, chlorite, and calc-spar, with con siderable native copper, is seen traversing a trappean rock composed of hornblende and feldspar, highly crystalline. Mr. Shaw sank on this vein"], [202, "172 Doc. No. 69. to the depth of fifteen feet, when he intersected a dark hornblende trap, in which the vein lost its character and became worthless. The most striking illustration of the changes of a vein in its passage through different mineral planes is to be seen on the northwest coast ot this island. The cliffs consist of numerous alternations of greenstone Fi? 34. and porphyry, which are cut by a vein varying from a few inches to two feet in width. The upper portion of the vein at a, is made up of trappean matter; a few feet lower down, at b, the gangue is entirely quartzose; still lower it gives place to calc-spar. It may be seen in the annexed figure; p, p, p, represent bands of porphyry; d, the lowest band of porphyry seen, which is amygdaloidal, the cavities being filled with calc-spar, below which point this substance entirely fills the space betweeen the walls, indicating a common origin of the calcareous matter both of the vein and the porph^ritic band. The bands of phophyry are separated from the trap by thin layers of laumonite. Formation of veins. \u2014 The manner in which veins occur would seem to indicate that they were rents or fissures formed subsequently to the con solidation of the different mineral planes. The parallelism exhibited in the same system of veins would further indicate that their direction had been determined, not by fortuitous circumstances, but by the operation of general laws. The materials composing the gangue of veins are often arranged in parallel plates, constituting what the Cornish miners call comby lodes. De laBeche supposes that this arrangement resulted from successive openings of the fissure. The following is a section of the gangue of a vein on the southeast quarter of section 10, township 60, range 39, Isle Royale: Fig. 35. 1. Laumonite, half of an inch. 2. Prehnite, with native copper, two inches. 3. Clay, probably decomposed chlorite, one inch. This vein appears to have been subject to three successive openings. The east vein of the Northwest Company ex hibits two combs: that attached to the foot- wall, six inches in width, is composed of calc-spar with little copper; that attached to the hanging-wall, twelve inches in width, consists of chlorite, quartz, and calc-spar, investing copper in spangles and masses. We have given sections of several veins in the chapter on mines, and they may be referred to in the further illustration of the structure of the veins of this region. In the Cliff vein, there are two combs \u2014 that attached to the foot wall containing most of the masses, while the other carries disseminated copper. The sheets of native copper, as a general thing, though not invariably occupy the foot- wall of the vein. Where crystals occur investing the walls, with their faces opposite,"], [203, "Doc. No. 69. 173 whether separated or interlocked, they afford strong presumptive evidence of the orginal width of the fissure. The Prince vein, Canada Shore, affords a beautiful illustration of this. The vein on Spar island is about fourteen feet in width, the walls being invested with amathystine quartz, with the facas turned outwards, occu pying two feet in width, while the intermediate space is filled in for the most part with calc-spar and pyritous copper. It is difficult to deiermine the order in which the materials composing the matrix of veins were deposited. In some cases the earthy substances were deposited before the metallic, and in others it is evident that copper existed in the fissures before the process of filling was complete. It is probable, however, that the copper was formed at different times. At the Copper Falls mine, for example, we find small specks of copper enclosed in obtuse rhomboidal crystals of calc-spar, variously modified; again, we find native copper deposited around crystals of analcime and calc-spar, taking the form of the faces of the crystals, every line and wave being faithfully represented, as in the electrotype process. The copper often appears in arborescent forms, invested with calc-spar. The Prince mine affords specimens of dog-tooth spar, studded with minute crystals of bi-sulphuret of copper, while the vitreous copper is often enclosed in a matrix of carbonate of lime. The silver in this vein is found in thin leaves, between the lamin\u00e6 or joints of the crytrallized spar, indicating that it was deposited subsequent to the filling of the vein. At the Minnesota mine it is not unusual to find spongiform copper ad hering to the walls, which would seem to indicate that copper was the first substance deposited in the fissure. Again we find it deposited in thin plates between the joints of the crystallized quartz, which would in dicate that the latter was deposited subsequent .to the former. We have before us a specimen from this mine, consisting of native copper, native silver, crystallized quartz, and carbonate of lime, (calc-spar.) The copper and silver are distinct, and appear to be chemically pure. The form of the crystals of quartz is impressed on the silver and copper, and in the body of the crystals there is no trace of a metallic substance. The calc spar, however, conforms to the silver and copper, both of these metals be ing disseminated through it. The silver occurs in imperfect octohedra ot the size of a pea. This arrangement would seem to indicate the following order in the de position of the materials: 1. Quartz; 2. Copper and silver; 3. Calc-spar. At the Cliff and North American mines perfect crystals of copper occur only in the cavities of the matrix; when in contact with quartz, it takes the form of this substance. The inference from these facts is, that some of the earthy materials con stituting the veinstone were deposited prior to the copper and silver, while others were subsequent in their deposition. The silver is generally found to occupy a certain position in the lode. Thus, at the Copper Falls mine, it is most abundant near the junction of the trap and conglomerate on the north; at the Cliff mine, near the junc tion of the crystalline greenstone and granular trap. Although silver is intimately associated with the copper, yet it does not occur in sufficient quantity to justify the expense of separating the two metals. The lodes are frequently brecciated the angular fragments evidentjy having been de-"], [204, "174 Doc. No. 69. rived from the adjacent walls \u2014 and are most abundant above the points where the fissure is nearly closed. Mode os formation.\u2014 Having endeavored td set forth the principal phe nomena of the veins of the Lake Superior district, we propose to advert to the principal theories which have been advanced to explain the method by which the process of filling has been accomplished. Native copper is often found in veins abounding in sulphurets, but un der circumstances very different from what are observed in the Lake Su perior district. Its presence is thus described and explained by De la Beche.* Beneath the gossan, which results from decomposition of the ore, we observe appearances strongly reminding us of the common electro type process for procuring copper from a solution of sulphate of copper. The pure metal is gathered together in chinks and cavities between the main mass of gossan and the body of the undecomposed copper pyrites, mingling perhaps with the lower part of the former. Sometimes this na tive copper, as it is called, may retain its metallic character; but at others it becomes converted into an oxide, and this again into a carbonate, by the percolation of waters containing common air and carbonic acid. It is probable that the sulphur, by a union with the needful oxygen, be came sulphuric acid, and that, this- formed, the copper was attacked and removed, to be dealt with like any other solution of the suiphate of copper. Three theories have been suggested to account for the filling of veins: 1st. That'the foreign matter has been injected in a molten state, and afterwards slowly crystallized. 2d. That the volatile matters have been slowly sublimed from below by heat, and condensed upon the walls of the fissure. 3d. That the materials were once held in aqueous solution, and pre cipitated by electro-chemical agency. f 1. Injection. \u2014 We can hardly conceive it possible that the copper, in a fluid state, has been forced up from below like dikes of porphyry or green stone. It is well known that, in many of the loftiest volcanoes, the col umn of lava does not rise to the lip of the crater, but breaks through the sides of the mountain. An elastic force sufficient to raise a fluid mass of three times the density of lava would shatter the enclosing walls, and force the copper into the fissures. If this were its origin, we ought to find it occupying the depressions in the surface rocks in the vicinity of the fissures, like modern lava currents. We find the copper investing various crystallized minerals, and every wave and stria of the pre-existing crystals is faithfully represented. It is impossible, by any artificial method, to cast any metal so as to exhibit such minute lines. They are as delicate and faithful as could be ob tained by the electrotype. Again, the associated minerals do not exhibit the effects of a high tem perature. These consist of zeolites, which yield potash, soda, and lime, and hold a large percentage of water of combination, and of carbonate of Admirality Manual, title Mineralogy. fin those veins which are widest near the surface, and gradually contract in their downward progress, the foreign matter has been undoubtedly introduced from above; and even in those veins which increase in width as they descend, occasional fragments derived from the surfacs have been met with. Thus Carne states that, at the Relistran mine, Cornwall, quartz pebbles, cemented by oxide of tin and bisulphuretof copper, have been found at the depth of 600 feet in a tin lode. The black oxide vein at Copper Harbor belongs to this class."], [205, "Doc. No. 69. 175 lime, (calc spar and andalusite,) and earthy silicious minerals, (quartz, agates, &e.) \u2014 all of which may be supposed to have resulted from the precipitation of aqueous solutions, rather than from fusion under pressure. Again, if the contents of the veins were the result of injection, their productiveness would be unaffected in their passage through different mineral planes. Lastly, copper and silver combine in indefinite proportions, forming a homogeneous compound; and yet we find them existing side by side al most chemically pure. Admitting that they once formed a homogeneous compound, it is reasonable to infer that they have been separated by elec tro-chemical ai>ency. 2. Sublimation. \u2014 This theory explains some of the phenomena of mineral veins which the preceding theory does not. Thus, in some veins, crystals of earthy materials line the walls, whose under surfaces are studded with minute metallic particles, while the upper surfaces are quite smooth. Iron glance is formed at this day in fissures on the margins of the cra ters of Vesuvius and Stromboli. The volatile particles are raised by heat, and condensed on the sides of the fissure in crystallized forms. The parallel arrangement of the different materials on the sides of the vein may also be explained by this hypothesis. The artificial production of various crystals \u2014 such as feldspar, hornblende, mica, and magnetic oxide of iron, found in the slags of furnaces, and of garnets, rubies, idocrase, and olivine, formed in the laboratory of the chemist \u2014 have also been relied on as affording direct evidence of sublimation. The minerals thus artificially produced, however, belong to a different class from those which accompany the native copper. This hypothesis does not explain the changes which are exhibited by veins traversing different rocks, nor the substitution of different metals in the same vein, chemically distinct. The fact that copper, silver, and lead have been found deposited on tim ber and leaves in some of the long- abandoned mines of Europe proves that heat is not the only solvent power by which these metals may be made to assume new forms. 3. Electrochemical agency . \u2014 There is but little doubt that magnetic currents are in a continual state of slow but regular change, sweeping round the two hemispheres. Ampere was the first to announce that these currents traversed the earth from east to west; and others have applied them in explanation of the chemical changes which have taken place in lodes during the process of their formation. The observations of Mr. Robert Were Fox, in the Philosophical Trans actions and the Proceedings of the Geological Society of Cornwall, upon the electro-magnetic properties of veins, and of Becquerel, in his \"Traite de l'Electricite,\" upon the artificial production of crystallized insoluble compounds of copper, lead, and lime, throw light upon one of the ob scurest pages in the history of the earth; yet it must be confessed that these experiments have not revealed all that was anticipated at the time of their promulgation. M. Becquerel shows that, by the long continued action of weak electrical currents, many crystallized subtances hitherto found only in nature may be artificially obtained. Mr. Fox, by placing copper wires against two portions of a lode, or of two lodes divided by a cross-course, and connecting the wires with a gal-"], [206, "Doc. No. 69. 176 vanometer, was enabled to detect a current of electricity. The needle was observed to deviate in some cases to such an extent that it was im possible to note the deflection. In nearly all of the mineral veins of Cornwall he was enabled to detect these currents, but in Teesdale the results of his experiments were negative. He was successful in procu ring an electrotype copy of an engraved plate, by a current collected from two lodes of iron and of copper pyrites, and also in inducing magnetism in a bar of soft iron. Professor Reich detected very decided currents in the lead and silver veins near Freyburg; but Von Strombeck on the other hand, could obtain no results in the copper and lead lodes of the Rhine. Mr. Robert Hunt made also numerous experiments in the mines of Cornwall, and almost invariably obtained indications of electricity \u2014 in one case so powerful that electro-chemical decomposition was produced. He also examined these currents in reference to their connexion with the general currents which traverse the earth, according to the theory of Ampere, and was induced to conclude that they were local, and due to the chemical action going on in the lode itself. They were often found to traverse the lode contrary to the general currents which sweep round the earth,, and often at right angles to them. He inferred that these local currents had had a powerful effect upon tl\u0153 masses of matter exposed to their influence, although the formation of veins might not originally have been due to their agency. The amount of muriate of soda (common salt) which he had sound in the waters of many of the deep mines of Cornwall, equalling in some cases nine hundred and fifty grains in a cubic foot, had, in his opinion, acted powerfully in inducing chemical changes in the lode.* The existence of two metals side by side, like copper and silver, each chemically pure, and capable of being alloyed in any proportions; the accumulation of the latter near the cross-courses, or at the junction of two mineral planes; the changes in the metallic contents of lodes in their pas sage through different rocks; and the parallel arrangement of the earthy gangues, \u2014 all seem to indicate the existence of electrical currents during the period of their formation. It is to magneiism \u2014 an agency subtle, but universal and all-powerful, pervading every particie of matter, and operating unceasingly \u2014 that we are to look for an interpretation of many of the obscurest passages in the history of the earth. To use the beautiful figure of Humboldt: \"That which forms the in- visible but living weapon of the electric eel; that which, awakened by the contact of moist dissimilar particles, circulates through all the organs of plants and animals; that which, flashing from the thunder-cloud, il- lumines the broad canopy of the sky; that which draws iron to iron, and directs the silently recurring march of the guiding needle, \u2014 all, like the several hues of the divided ray of light, flow from one source, and all blend again together in one perpetual, everywhere-diffused force. \"j * Lecture on the electricity of mineral veins, before the Royal Institution, London. t Aspects of Nature, vol. 1, art. 1."], [207, "Doc.

The term metallurgy is applied to the art of extracting the various use ful metals from their ores, so as to furnish them to the manufacturer and consumer in such a state of purity as may be required in the various uses to which they are applied in the arts. The processes by which copper is reduced from its combination with iron and sulphur in the ore, from which the greater portion of that metal is ex tracted, are long and tedious; nor is the skill of the smelter sufficient to separate the copper in a perfect state of purity and freedom from other metals which impair its value. On the contrary, the copper of commerce contains considerable quantities of iron, leaa, nickel, and other metals, as is shown by the following analyses of refined copper from various dis tricts: I.

Native copper from Brazil, having a specific gravity of 8,962, contained iron, 0.17; calcium, 0.38; magnesium, 0.33. Japanese copper is said to be perfectly pure; also the native copper from the Siberian mines, according to G. Ros\u20ac. The native copper from the Lake Superior mines may be considered to be chemically pure. It dissolves in pure nitric acid without leaving a trace of residuum; it gives no precipitate when the nitric acid solution is heated with ammonia; neither on the addition of chloro-hydric acid. It dissolves to a clear solution in concentrated sulphuric acid when heated; it contains no trace of arsenie or other volatile metal. This is the result ot the examination of several specimens of copper from the Ph\u0153uix, Cliff. and Minnesota mines. Apiece of copper from the last-named mine, sawn 12"], [208, "178 Doc. No. 69. with care from a perfectly pure and solid mass, was found to have the specific gravity us 8.838. The density of pure copper is given by dif ferent authors as follows: Peligot and Fremy, pure fused copper - . - - 8.78 Berzelius, \" \" ... - 8.83 Scheerer andMarchand, \" \" - - - - 8.921 Scheerer and Marchand, copper in fine wire - 8.952 It has been asserted that some of the native copper contains a small portion of silver alloyed with it. This may be the case; but we have not found any silver in the specimens which we have examined, when no particles of that metal were visible in the mass. The method of occurrence of the native silver In connexion with the copper in the Lake Superior region is one of the most novel and striking features in the distribution of the metallic riches of that district. Native silver occurs by no means unfrequently, at various points of the trap range, from one extremity of the district to the other. It has, however, been found in the greatest quantity at the Ph\u0153nix, Cliff, Copper Falls, and Minnesota mines; the largest specimen hitherto obtained was taken from the workings of the Ph\u0153nix (formerly Lake Superior) Company's mine. It was a rolled, detached lump, perfectly pure, which weighed over six pounds, and is now in the collection of the mint at Philadelphia. This mass was found in a large excavation or pot-hole worn by the ac tion of the. stream in passing over the course of the vein, and filled with the debris of the vein and the adjoining rocks, and numerous masses of copper and silver derived from the ruins of the veinstone. Several thousand dollars' worth of the latter metal were taken from this hole. In the various excavations on this location, numerous specimens of silver associated with copper have been obtained, both in the vein, where they generally occur associated with prehnite, and in the adjacent rock, either in bunches and strings,*or sometimes in almost invisible particles. A specimen of native silver from the Minnesota mine was found to contain no other foreign substance than a trace of copper. A specimen from the old Lake Superior Company's mine contained no copper, but a small quantity of iron. The silver and copper do not, however, in general, occur alloyed with each other, as would naturally be supposed on the theory that they have been forced up together in a state of fusion from the heated interior of the earth. The silver is scattered through the metallic copper in such a manner that each metal remains entirely free from alloy with the other, although the junction of the two at their edges is a perfect one. The sil ver is often interspersed in the mass of copper, so as to form a species of porphyry, the former metal occuring in small patches and particles per fectly soldered to the enclosing mass of copper, yet, chemically speak ing, entirely distinct from it. The native silver seems to occur especially in connexion with a soft greenish magnesian mineral, also with calc spar and prehnite, and has never, so far as we know, been found distinctly crystallized, as the copper often is. The only question of any practical difficulty in regard to the metallurgic treatment of the Lake Superior copper is that of the occurrence of the native silver in connexion with the copper. If there should be a large amount of silver found finely intermix d"], [209, "179 Doc. No. 69. with the copper, so that it could not be mechanically separated, it Would be important to decide how the two metals could be separated in the most economical manner, and how small a percentage of silver could be economically worked. If the percentage of silver in the copper is large, a separation of the two metals can be effected by the use of acids in the humid way. The so-called \"aqua regia\" was many years since used by Keir, in England, for separating metallic silver from copper. It con sists of a mixture of concentrated sulphuric and nitric acids, or oil of vitriol, mixed with one-tenth its weight of saltpetre. By this reagent the silver is dissolved, and the copper only very slightly acted on. In the separation of silver from copper, when both the ores of these metals occur in combination, in the Harz, the method called lirpiation is resorted to. Inthisoperationthe argentiferous copper, which may contain as low as 0.0016 per cent, of silver, is fused, in the state of black copper, with between two and three times its weight of lead and litharge, and cast into large flat disks, which are then ready for the liquation furnace. In the treatment by this furnace the lead containing the silver flows off into the well in front of the hearth, whence it is taken with ladles and cast into ingots. The silver is then separated from the lead by cupellation. At Tsiklova, in the Bannat, the silver contained in the black copper is \u25a0separated by amalgamation- The ores are principally argentiferous mispi ckel mixed with copper pyrites. The black copper obtained by three separate processes of fusion, contains from 80 to 90 per cent, of copper, with from 0.00125 to 0.00375 per cent, of silver. This is heated to the highest point possible without its fusing, and then pulverized by stamps. The pulverized substance is then mixed with 10 per cent, of common salt and a little sulphuret of iron, and heated in the reverberatory furnace. The resulting chloride of silver is then \u25a0amalgamated with mercury, by means of a suitable apparatus \u2014 thereduc tionof the silver being effected by copper, which at the same time converts the small portion of chloride of copper which had been formed in the pro cess of chloruration into bichloride of copper. The amalgam is then dis tilled, so that no mercury is lost in the operation; and the copper is fused and refined. Up to the present time, the quantity of silver occurring with the copper in th'e Lake Superior region has not been sufficient to render it worth while to erect the furnaces and make the required outlay for sepa rating these two metals; but, should the number of mines be much in creased, and the quantity of silver obtained be considerable, it will be ex pedient to make suitable preparation for separating this metal. At present, at the Cliff mine, the particles of silver which are so flattened by the stamps as to be easily seen, are separated by hand, the coarse metal from the stamps being picked over with care for that purpose.. The silver oc curring only occasionally, and then often in masses of considerable size, there can be no doubt that a very considerable amount is purloined by the miners, who seem to consider the silver found in the vein as their property. The small quantity of silver which may remain with the copper be comes, in the operation of smelting, alloyed with it, and undoubtedly improves the quality of the metal. Taking into view what has already been said in the preceding chapters on the occurrence of the copper in the mines of Lake Superior, it is .evi-"], [210, "1S0 Doc. No. 69. dent that the practical questions involved in the working of this region are exceedingly simple, and that few mining districts occur where mines can be opened with such facility, and their products converted into money with so little outlay of capital or skill in their metallurgic treat ment. The greater portion of the copper produced in the world is obtained from the combinations of that metal with sulphur, and principally from the. ore commonly called copper pyrites, or sulphuret of copper and iron. In addition to the mechanical preparation of such ores, they require a long and complicated process to free the copper from the accompanying foreign substances, the theory of which may be thus briefly summed up: 1. First roasting or calcination. \u2014 This process is performed either in peculiar furnaces or in roasting pits or heaps. By it the greater portion of the sulphur is oxidized; the metals are converted into basic sulphates, which remain mixed with the portions of the ore which have escaped oxi dation. 2. First fusion or melting for coarse metal. \u2014 Silicious substances are added, if necessary, in sufficient quantity to take up the iron, which combines it together, to form silica of the protoxide of iron, making a fusible slag; the sulphuric acid is reduced to sulphur, and the oxide of copper to copper, and sulphuret of copper is formed. The heavy combi nation of sulphur and copper sinks to the bottom of the furnace, while the light slag floats on the surface. This sulphuret of copper still con tains considerable sulphuret of iron. 3. Second roasting or calcination of coarse metal. \u2014 The mass obtained by the last process is now broken up, and again roasted for several weeks in peculiar furnaces. The object of this operation is to oxidize thecgpper. 4. Second fusion. \u2014 The ore is again fused, with the addition of sili cious substances, if necessary \u2014 the object of which treatment is to take up the portion of iron which still remains. The copper obtained by this process still contains many impurities: it is called black metal. 5. Refining. \u2014 The copper is fused and subjected to a process by which the foreign metals present in it are oxidized, and form a crust on the sur face of the fused mass, which is constantly skimmed off. The copper is treated in this way till it acquires the properties of the pure metal, when the operation is suspended. It is then cast in ingots, or cooled \u2022upon the sur face by throwing on water, and removed in successive flat masses, called rosettes. This is the general description of the processes by which the ores are treated, though the details vary much in different countries and under different circumstances. The number of distinct processes which the ore undergoes in the great smelting establishments of Swansea is at least ten, which are entirely distinct from each other. The sulphurets of copper there require a long and expensive process for smelting\u2014 a process which demands the highest metallurgic skill, and a large amount of capital. Eight companies have the control of the great Welsh furnaces, where so large a portion of the copper used throughout the world is smelted. The question arises then, Are the sulphurets of copper destined to form an important part of the production of the Lake Superior mines ? The occurrence of the sulphurets of copper in the Lake Superior region is by no means a very uncommon fact. Two localities have furnished"], [211, "Doc. No. 69. 181 ground for mining operations \u2014 one of which has been entirely abandoned \u25a0;\u25a0 the other is temporarily suspended, though it is believed that the mine is not considered by the proprietors as entirely proved. The ore in each of these cases is mostly the black sulphuret. The yellow ore is found in comparatively small quantity, associated with the variegated. We do not believe that appearances thus far indicate that any ore of copper exists in the Lake Superior region in sufficient quantity to be worthy of being worked. We have, therefore, a comparatively simple task to discuss the metallurgy proper of this district, since nature furnishes us With the pure metal, associated with easily-fused veinstones, from which it can be sep arated by the simplest of processes \u2014 fusion. The native copper is considered by the miners as coming under three distinct heads, according to its state of subdivision in the rock, and the size of the pieces of the metal. They are as follows: 1st. Mass. 2d. Barrel-work. 3d. Stamp- work. 1. Mtms. \u2014 In stopeing, when a large sheet of copper occurs in the vein, the rock is removed from one side of it, and it is thrown down by means of a sand-blast, and thus lies or itfands upon the bottom of the level or drift. Masses have been detached from the Vein which were esti- mated to weigh 60 or 70 tons, mostly of solid copper, in an irregular, flat tened, tabular shape, now expanding to a width of from 2 to 3 feet, and then contracting to a few inches, but firmly united. Of course, such a mass is too large to be moved in the level or raised to the surface, and it is of importance that as litile of the process of subdivision as pos* sible should be done under ground, since the operation, which must necessarily last a long time, impedes the work in the mine, and is less conveniently executed in a narrow, confined space, where easy access cannot be had to the mass on all sides, and where it cannot be readily moved. The use of powerful rtiachinery and tackle for elevating masses of several tons' weight will be gradually introduced, when their occurrence may be reckoned upon as forming a considerable part of the value of the mine. The process of dividing the masses, at present, is as follows, and is the same whether above and below the surface: A groove or Channel is cut diagonally, at a convenient point, where the copper is as pure as possible, and the thickness comparatively small, which is carried through the mass till it is separated into two parts. To effect this, one /person holds a chisel, the cutting edge of which is about three-fourths of an inch in width, and of varying length, according to the thickness of the mass to be divided; another per son strikes with a heavy sledge, and at each blow the chisel is sunk into the groove and moved laterally so as to prevent its becoming wedged, until at last a chip of copper is taken out several inches in length. A repetition of this process at length completely severs the metallic mass. If the copper be perfectly pure, the operation proceeds rapidly and regularly; but when quartzose matter is to be traversed by the chisel, the labor is more tedious, and requires greater care. The cost of this operation is from $6 to $7 per square foot of surface cut through. No other process than this, tedious and expensive as it may seem to be, has yet been resorted to for dividing the masses. If the blocks were of pure copper, and not liable to contain bauds and nodules of silicious mat.-"], [212, "182 Dor. No. 69. ter, it is probable that a machine might be contrived for performing the operation by a kind of saw, driven by steam-power, somewhat similar to that used in dividing railroad bars. Taking into consideration, however,. the difficulty just mentioned, it seems doubtful whether any more eco nomical or efficacious means can be contrived than that which is already in use. It has been suggested that fusion of the masses might be effected,. so as to divide them in that manner; but the fact that copper is so good a conductor that it would be impossible to confine the effect of the heat to a limited space and obtain a temperature high enough to produce fusion at a particular point seems to render any such method inapplicable. The greatest thickness of a solid mass of copper, without seam or break, observed by us, was two feet four inches. This was at the Cliff mine. At the Minnesota, there appeared to be a solid mass in the vein, at least five feet in thickness. When the masses have been brought to the surface, they are still further subdivided, if necessary, into blocks varying from one to two tons in weight \u2014 such as may be conveniently transported to the lake, whence they are shipped to market. The Boston and Pittsburg (Cliff) Company have erected a furnace at Pittsburg for fusing these masses \u2014 the details of which, however, the trustees do not allow to be made public. There is no prac tical difficulty whatever in the way of obtaining the copper at once perfectly pure. The veinstone consists generally of fusible minerals, such as prehnite and the zeolitic minerals, orof quartz and calcareous spar, which flow readily together. In the report of the trustees of the Pittsburg Com pany the per centage of the mass is estimated at 60 of pure copper in 100- 2. Bairel-work. \u2014 This is the name given at the Lake Superior mines to the smaller masses of copper, which are too large to go under the stamps, and too small to be shipped separately. It includes masses of cop per in bunches and string-like forms, which are firmly bound together with a greater or less amount of the veinstone, and weighing from a few pounds up to several hundred. These smaller masses are picked out from the matter raised to the surface, and dressed by the hammer, so as to free them, as much as possible, from the adhering rock or veinstone. They are then barrelled up in stout casks, which hold from five to eight hundred pounds of metal and rock. These are smelted by the Pittsburg Company, with the larger masses. The barrel-work at the Cliff mine is estimated at 50 per cent of pure copper. The proportion of barrel- work to stamp-work furnished by the Cliff mine will be seen by reference to the table appended to the account of that mine, under the head of \" Mines and Mining.\" 3. Stamp-work. \u2014 This includes all the veinstone with metallic cop per in sufficient quantity to allow of its being separated by the process of washing after the stamping. The limit of the quantity of copper con tained in the rock which may be profitably stamped and washed, we cannot yet fix with certainty This depends on a variety of circum stances: as, for instance, the price of labor, the economical arrangement of the works above ground, and, especially, the construction of the wash ing apparatus. The great difference in the specific gravity of the vein stone and the metallic copper \u2014 the former being from 2.7 to 3.5, the latter nearly 9 \u2014 renders a perfect separation of the two very easy, and requires a much less complicated and scientific arrangement of the machinery"], [213, "Doc. No. 69. 183 than in those cases where the ore is only a little heavier than the gangue. Of course, as the country becomes settled, and the price of labor falls, and greater method is introduced into the works, a rock containing a smaller per centage of copper may be profitably worked. Before the rock is stamped, it is necessary that it should be roasted, in order that the veinstone, especially the quartz, may be rendered friable, so that it will readily yield to the blows of the stamps. The roasting is effected in the open air. The rock containing the copper is arranged in alternate layers with billets of wood, and then fired, and allowed to smoulder for forty-eight hours. The heat should not be carried suffi ciently far to cause any portion of the copper to be fused. If necessary, water may be dashed upon the heap while still hot, to aid in destroying the cohesion between the particles of the rock. The price of fuel is so low that this method will undobtedly be em ployed, although a more economical one might probably be devised. After having been calcined, the ores are taken to the stamping-mill. This con sists of several pestles of wood in a ver tical position, to which heads of iron, weighing 200 pounds or more, are at tached. A cylindrical axle revolves hori zontally, and is armed with cams, which, acting successively, catch into the should ers of the pestles and raise them to the required height, when they are disen gaged and fall into an oblong cast ircn trough, which is fed with ore from a hop per above. Three or four pestles com pose a battery, and several batteries are usually employed in a stamping-mill. Figures 36 and 37 represent the arrange ment and form of the stamps used at the Cliff mine \u2014the former being a front view of a single battery with four pestles, while figure 37 is a section showing the manner in which the ore and water a:e introduced. Fig. 36. An attempt was made at the Cliff mire to stamf> the ore dry, and also at the Lake Superior Company's works to pulverize it by a pair of crushing-wheels; but it ' is satisfactorily demonstrated that the Lake Superior ores can be stamped only by the aid of water. After stamping, comes the much more difficult process of washing the metal from pulverized rock, so that every particle may be separated with out loss. As the present methods of washing practised on the lake are very imperfect, we add an account of the most approved machinery for that purpose used in the French and German mines."], [214, "184 Doc. No. 69. Fig. 37. The most simple method of washing is by agitating the metalliferous sand in a bucket, by hand, im parting to it a rotatory irio tion, so that the lighter particles of earthy mattes may be thrown over the top, while the heavier ones containing the valuable metal or ore sink to the bottom of the vessel. Washing can be very per fectly performed in this way with sufficient care; and, simple as the method is, it is one which is ex tensively used in the wash ing of auriferous sands. The same thing can, how ever, be effected much more economically by va rious mechanical contri- vances, such as percussion and sleeping-tables, The water as it issues from under the stamps is made to circulate through a system of canals called a labyrinth, carrying with it the pul verized ore which is distributed at points more or less remote, de pendent on the size and specific gravity of the particles. (See figure 38 which represents the most approved form of this apparatus.) In these troughs the metallic parti cles are deposited in con stantly decreasing quan tity from the end nearest the stamps to the place of exit, where the earthy par ticles are carried ont de prived of all the ore with which they had been pre viously intermixed. The same thing may be effected by the opeiatioh' called riddling, or jigging \u2014 an operation which is performed principally on the rubbish produced in breaking the ores. This may bedone by hand em ploying a kind of sieve or riddle, the bottom of Fig. 38. which is covered by a plate of metal pierced with holes, which is jerked up and down, with a partially rotatory movement i in a cistern of walas\u00bb"], [215, "Doc. No. 69. 185 The water enters the orifices and holds the particles of ore and gangue suspended for a moment, when they arrange themselves in the order of their specific gravities, and are thus deposited in the sieve, and after wards separated, the upper portion being removed by a spatula and re- jected. Figure 39 represents a simple and effective instru ment now used in the Harz for this purpose. The sieves or riddles are in this ma chine fixed, and the water is made to ascend and descend through them by the alternate vertical motion of a solid pis ton. By this arrangement the process of riddling can be per formed with great ease and perfection. The copper can be perfectly separated from the gangue in the Lake Superior ores by washing the deposites which Fig. 39. have accumulated in the labyrinth by means of what are called sleeping tables. Figure 40 represents a section of the common sleeping-table. Fig 40. It consists, in general, of an inclined board, at the elevated end of which a stream of water is made to run upon the mixed mass of pulverized metal and gangue. The water, as it descends the inclined surface, car ries with it the particles, which tend constantly to deposite themselves in the order of their specific gravity, the heaviest nearest the upper end of the table. A workman, with a kind of rake, continually pushes the de scending materials upwards, till the metallic portions have become suffi ciently separated from the particles of the gangue. The former are then removed by opening a slide, through which they are allowed to fall into a suitable receptacle beneath. The same processes are repeated till a complete separation has been effected. The washed metal is then packed in strong casks and transported to the furnace, where the smelting is per formed, and the copper is cast. into suitable shape for the market."], [216, "186 Doc.

The region of the great lakes may be considered as the headquarters of the North American drift. From the mouth of the St. Lawrence to the borders of Lake Superior there is hardly a spot where the drift de posites are lost sight of. They generally form low, level plains, but some times rise in high bluffs and terraces, and again merely cap the promon tories of the bolder cliffs. Throughout this long line of inland country there is, however, noplace where these formations are more extensive than on the southern shore of Lake Superior\u2014 more especially its southeastern coast. There, they not only constitute the only visible formations for nearly one hundred miles, but they also attain an astonishing thickness, so as to form, by themselves, ridges and cliffs which exceed in height even those of the Pictured Rocks \u2014 being in some places (for example, at the Grand Sable) not less than three hundred and sixty feet high. In consequence of this preponderance of the drift deposite, that portion of the shore of the great lake is the least attractive in a picturesque point of view \u2014 it being in the nature of the detri tal deposites to soften down the contrasts, and to produce uniformity and monotony. The drift is less conspicuous along the western portion of the lake shore, although it is not wanting even among the romantic and precipitous cliffs of the Pictured Rocks and the Red Castles. The great difference which exists in the oiographical and geological structure of the eastern and western portion of the southern shore has exercised a power ful influence upon the drift. Since the peninsula of Keweenaw Point, which projects so boldly into the lake, divides the whole country into distinct regions, both in a mineralogical and geological point of view, we may as well consider it also as a dividing-point for the drift \u2014 the more so, as it is now, and long will be, the general landing-place for all those who visit the shores of Lake Superior. We shall therefore start from Kewee naw Point, to examine first those drift deposites which extend to the west of it along the copper region, and afterwards those which line the coast as far as the Saut and the Straits of Mackinac. Before we proceed to the investigation of the peculiarities and distribution of the drift masses in either of these regions, it will be proper to give a brief account of the different divisions which we have recognised. The drift of Lake Superior may be divided into four different deposites, which, in an ascending order, exhibit the following characteristics:"], [217, "Dor. No 69. 187 1st. A layer of coarse materials, composed of pebbles intermingled with loam, which we will designate as coarse drift. 2d. A layer of clay resting either on the coarse drift, or, where this want ing, on the rock. This is the drift clay of Lake Superior. 3d. A deposite of sand , gravel, and pebbles, irregularly stratified, resting upon the clay, or upon the rock itself. 4th. A considerable number of isolated boulders, scattered over the whole region, forming the uppermost portion of the drift deposites. The polished and grooved surfaces which occur in connexion with the drift constitute, likewise, a most important feature in its history. Finally, there are the drift terraces and ridges, which likewise deserve a close examination, in order to ascertain their bearing in reference to the changes of level which have taken place during and since the drift epoch. I. Coarse drift. \u2014 This deposite is the least conspicuous of all. It is found only in a few places along the southern shore of Lake Superior, generally capping the high towering cliffs of sandstone, (as, for example, at the Red Castles, west of the Portage, and also at the top of the Pictured Rocks.) It is generally a mixture of loam and fragments of rock of different size \u2014 sometimes worn, but more generally angular. As a leading feature, we may state that it is almost exclusively composed of fragments of the rocks in situ, showing that, whatever may have been its origin, it could not have been acted upon by long-continued agencies. After a careful examination, I found but few foreign pebbles, mostly of trap, scattered through the mass, aud evidently derived from the neighbor hood. The whole mass is nowhere more than thirty feet thick. We ought to add further, that in many places the pebbles may be seen disap pearing gradually, and the whole passing into a regular drift clay. This deposite might, perhaps, seem hardly worth mentioning, were it not that its peculiar structure and its position remind us of a similar de posite widely diffused throughout New England, especially in the moun tainous districts of Vermont, where it forms the most conspicuous feature of the drill. 2. Drift clay, or red clay. \u2014 This deposite has been long ago recognised as a peculiar one, distinct from the drift-gravel and sand above it, and the coarse drift beneath it. It has been described by the geologists of the Michigan State survey as the tertiary clay of Lake Superior. From its red color, which is one of its leading features, it is also called by some red clay. It is difficult to determine its average thickness, from the fact that, in many places where it is highly developed, it sinks below the waters of the lake, aud in other cases, where its base is visible, its top has been partly washed away. There are, however, some places (for example, at the western portion of the Grand Sable) whefte it maybe seen undisturbed in its natural position, its base resting on the almost horizontal strata of red sandstone, a few feet above the water, whilst its top is covered by a considerable mass of drift sand. I found the deposite in this place to be sixty feet in thickness, exhibiting lines of stratification disposed with much regularity. Its upper limit may be here seen stretching in a horizontal line for a long distance. We may well .consider this locality as indicating the average thickness of the clay. However distinct the upper limit of the, clay may be in general, it is also seen in many localities al ternating with the sand above, or passing gradually into it \u2014 thus showing that both deposites, although of different materials, belong, nevertheless,"], [218, "I*bc. No 69. 188 to the same formation, and therefore that there is no real ground to con sider the clay as being a part of the tertiary formation As far as its composition is concerned, it appears to be a mixture of loam and clay, and its color is owing to the decomposition of the red sandstone and trap from which it has been derived. Though the main mass of the clay stratum is composed of very finely comminuted substances, and of tentimes reduced to an almost impalpable powder, yet there are many pebbles interspersed through it, and even boulders of considerable size, generally rounded and smoothed . Fragments of metallic ores and native copper occur occasionally in it\u2014 the latter sometimes weighing several hundred pounds. It was by means of the fragments of copper scat tered through the clay that the attention of the early travellers was first attracted to the copper mines of that region, which are now so extensively wrought. Asa whole, the great Clay stratum of Lake Superior cannot be con sidered as being regularly stisitified, though there may be seen in many places bands of different color, and differing in the size of the materials, resembling in their regularity a kind of stratification. Neither is there ahy striking variety to be observed between the materials, either at the base or' at the top; so that the conditions under which the deposite was? formed must have been uniform, and rather quiet. As to its extent, it appears, from what we know, to be spread over an immense tract of country. Not only is it found along the whole southern coast of Lake Superior to Fond du Lac, and along the St. Louis river ab far as geologists have extended their investigations, but it occurs also on the north shore, where it has been traced for a considerable distance along several rivers' which empty into the lake. It was observed, however, by Mr. Whittlesey, that to the northwest of Lake Superior the drift assumes an ash-colored tint, which is owing, no doubt, to the absence of red sand stone in these regions. If we were to cohsider merely the position of this clay as it appears on the southern border of Lake Superior, forming, as it does, a regular stratum, resting upon the red sandstone, and being limited to a certain height, where it is followed by the drift sand, we* might well conclude that it was deposited in a circumscribed basin. This is, indeed, the im pression which a traveller might receive if he were Merely to coast around the lake. Such an impression would be, however, entirely erroneous; for, in ascending the highlands which rise behind those cliffs, we meet again with the same clay at an elevation of from six to eight hundred feet \u2014 as, for instance, near the Jackson location on Carp river, and in several places along the road leading to it. It also forms lofty cliffs on the river Ontonagon\u2014 as high as five hundred feet. In all these places its composi tion is the same as along the lake shore, being quite as comminuted, and forming the same sticky loam when wet. It ought to be observed, how ever, that, on the whole, it seems to be limited merely to the depressions of the soil, and never to cover the culminating points. 3. Drift sand and gravel. \u2014 This is the most widely diffused of all the drift deposites along the shore of Lake Superior, as well as over the whole northern part of the country. It not only covers the clay deposite in most of the localities where the latter has been observed, but also extends over many places where this does not reach. We have stated that the clay, even at its highest level, was generally limited to the depressions. The"], [219, "189 Doc. No. 69. drift sand and gravel have no such limitations. It is found on the up lands and along the slopes of the hills, as well as in the depressions. Although separated from the drift of the western prairies by the dividing ridge between the upper peninsula of Michigan and Wisconsin, yet in many places, where the ridge is not of considerable elevation, it may be seen passing directly from one slope to the other, especially on the south eastern corner of the lake \u2014 as we shall have occasion to show hereafter. It is likewise said to pass from one slope to the other at the southwestern border between the lake and the head waters of the Mississippi. It is found on the highest summits of the Pictured Rocks \u2014 nearly two hundred feet. Its relation to the drift clay can be easily ascertained merely from the state of the roads and trails, which are generally dry and pleasant on the drift sand. No rule obtains as to the composition of the drift- sand and gravel, either in reference to the size or the mineralogical character of the materials. Layers of fine sand alternate in every possible way with layers of peb bles \u2014 sometimes by a gradual transition, at others rather abruptly. The pebbles themselves are composed of all kinds of stone \u2014 some from the immediate neighborhood, others from places more remote. They are generally rounded and smoothed, showing that they must have under gone a prolonged and violent motion, such as could have taken place only in the water. The same is the case with the boulders imbedded in the mass, of which there are many of considerable size \u2014 from five to six feet through. Many of the boulders are also covered with scratches, such as could have been produced only by a violent and steady rubbing. We would state, besides, as a further peculiarity of the drift pebbles and boulders, that they are generally clean, there being no loam or mud at tached to them \u2014 a peculiarity which is in itself sufficient to distinguish the gravel drift from the loam deposites of coarse drift before described. The thickness of the drift-sand and gravel, like that of the clay, is best ascertained along the shore of the lake. There seems to be a sort of an tagonism as to the relative thickness of both deposites between the east ern and western portions of the lake shore. Whilst the clay seems to as sume its greatest thickness west of Keweenaw Point, the sand and gravel seem most developed to the east of that point. Its greatest thickness we found to be at Grand Sable, where the coast rises, according to Mr. Whit ney's barometrical measurement, 360 feet above the lake; and since the clay stratum underneath is only sixty feet thick, it gives an amount of three hundred feet for the sand and gravel deposite. From that spot the same drift deposite may be seen extending in the form of a high cliff to the southeast, generally some miles distant from the lake shore; until it reaches it again at Point Iroquois, where it rises almost to the same height \u2014 345 feet; thence it sinks gradually towards the Saut. A further peculiarity of the drift-sand and gravel deposites we would mention \u2014 their irregular and undulating surface, especially where they cover wide tracts of country: as, for instance, in the plains of Wisconsin and Illinois, which, from this feature, have been denominated rolling prairies, in op position to the level prairies, which are mostly alluvial. The shores of Lake Superior are, in this respect, less striking \u2014 owing, no doubt, to the fact that the country is less level, and also in consequence of the forests which cover the ground almost everywhere. The summit of the Grand Sable, as will be noticel subsequently, is the place where this undula-"], [220, "Doc. No. 69. 190 ting appearance is most striking on the lake shore. There can be no doubt that, as a whole, the drift sand and gravel is a stratified deposite, although the stratification is perhaps more imperfect than in any other sed imentary formation. The strata are generally the most distinct where the mass is composed of fine sand. They are less conspicuous in the gravel, except where it alternates with layers of sand or clay, in which case the separation into layers is sometimes very distinct. As a frequent occur rence, we would especially mention those irregular layers which have been designated under the name of cross-stratification by some, and of discordant straHfication by others. There may be sometimes seen in a single section three, four, five, and even more plans of stratification, forming among themselves all sorts of angles \u2014 some horizontal, some slightly inclined, and others almost vertical. Instances of such stratifi cation are to be seen all along the coast of Lake Superior, in the drift as well as in the alluvial sand. They are less frequent where the deposites assume a more loamy character. It is well known that this discordant stratification is not limited to the quarternary deposites, but occurs in sandstone of every age. Along Lake Superior, where the drift deposites rest immediately on the Potsdam sandstone, it is a rather impressive sight for a geologist to witness, side by side, this structure both in the oldest and most recent of the sedimentary formations, thus showing that the same laws of deposition, even in minor details, have prevailed at all times in the formation of the earth's crust. Some doubt still exists as to the cause of these singular stratifications. The attention of geologists was first di rected to them in the recent deposites of the valley of Switzerland, where two rivers (the Rhone and Arve) meet. They were ascribed by M. Necker to the disturbance caused by the meeting of two currents of va riable strength, contending with each other in the same bed, whence the strata resulting from this conflict were called stratifications torrentielles. In this way the Swiss geologists succeeded in explaining, not only the variable inclination of the strata, but also their difference of materials, when it happens that one of the currents carries coarser substances than the other. It is evident, however, that this explanation does not apply to the similar structure of the sand deposites along the sea and lake shore, where the conflict is no longer caused by rivers, but by the con tending forces of waves and currents. We know, for instance, that in some shallow harbors \u2014 that of Charlestown, for example \u2014 the pilots have to make out the channel after every severe gale. This shows that the waves exert a strong influence upon the bottom, where it is shallow enough to come within their reach; and since, from the nature of the waves, we must suppose their action to be broken and unsteady, we might well expect such irregular strata to be formed wherever the waves and tides come in conflict. Along Lake Superior there are no tidal cur rents, as far as we know; but the currents resulting from the changes of the wind are strong enough to account for similar conflicts. If this ex planation be true, we might then expect such discordant stratification wherever the water is shallow enough to allow the bottom to be stirred up by the waves. Indeed, there is every probability that all sand and sandstone formations which exhibit a similar structure have been formed in shallow water \u2014 an inference which, as far as the drift is concerned, is confirmed by other considerations, which we shall examine hereafter. 4. Boulders. \u2014 Of all the drift deposites, the boulders have, from all"], [221, "191 Doc. No. 69. times and in all countries, excited the greatest interest, in consequence of their size, as well as of their position. The mere view of a huge block of granite, situated, as it often happens, on the summit of a hill, whilst the rock on which it rests is of limestone or sandstone, is sufficient to excite the curiosity of every thinking man, as to the place from which this stranger may have come, and as to the mode by which its transpor tation was accomplished. We ought not to be astonished, therefore, that most of the theories which have been imagined to solve the problem of the drift should refer chiefly, if not exclusively, to the boulders. Froth looking at them in a too exclusive point of view, most geologists have misunderstood their true signification; they have overlooked the other more regular deposites with which they are connected: thus forgetting that the boulders form but a part of the drift formation, and represent but one single though striking event in a long period of the earth's history \u2014 that of the quarternary epoch. This we consider the chief cause of the insufficiency of most of the theories. Before we attempt any explana tion, our object will be first to examine their peculiarities, as exemplified in t\\e region of Lake Superior \u2014 which we deem the more important, as this region seems to have been the point of departure for many of them, scattered far and wide over the country. Boulders of every size and description occur in great numbers along the whole southern shore., and are said to be as numerous along the north shore. As a whole, they did not strike me by their dimensions. They do not by any means equal those huge masses found in Switzerland and in many pans of New England. The largest boulder which I noticed was one of hornblende, near Carp river, measuring 15 feet in length, 11 in width, aud 6^- in height; another, near the Portage, measured 8^ feet in length and 5 in width. On the borders of Lake Superior, as in all other countries where drift occurs, the boulders are the most widely diffused. They are scat tered over the whole country, aud may be seen at all heights, where no other drift deposites reach. They are truly the vanguard of the drift for mation, in height as well as space. Even the dividing ridge, where it rises the highest, does not limit their extent; for they have been found as high as one thousand feet above the lake south of the Anse, and may be from thence traced uninterruptedly along the southern slope of the ridge into the prairies of Wisconsin and Illinois. As to their mineralogical composition, there is every variety of rocks to be found, and in many in stances they may be traced to their origin at no very great distance. We thus scon accustomed ourselves not to look any longer upon them as strangers, as we do where there is no analogy whatever between them and the rocks on which they rest. Among the most numerous boulders along the lake may be mentioned those of granite, trap, and hornblende rocks, which are common to both shores. Boulders of sandstone are less frequent, in spite of the great predominance of this rock along the south shore \u2014 a circumstance easily accounted for by its greater softness, which renders it the more destructible. As a general rule, it may be stated that most of the boulders scattered over the Lake Superior region have not come from far. This is of the utmost importance, since it ac tually enables us to trace the route which they have followed ; and as to their direction, I feel no hesitation in affirming that most of the boulders within the region of Lake Superior have been transported from north to south. As instances of this southerly transportation, I shall state the"], [222, "192 Doc. No. 69. following facts. The iron region of Lake Superior is situated near Carp river, east of Keweenaw Point; and, although the ridges where the iron ore occurs are only some ten miles from the shore, yet there is not a sin gle boulder, nor even pebble, of iron to be seen north of the ridges. This ore, of which there are innumerable fragments scattered at the foot and in the immediate vicinity of the ridges, is so conspicuous, from its banded structure, that it would undoubtedly have been noticed, if it did occur at all north of its origin. In going from the iron ridges towards the south, iron pebbles and boulders occur in abundance, and may be traced for some distance. Thus, in September last, Mr. Whitney, starting from the ridges east of the Jackson location, traced boulders of iron ore all along his route towards the Escanaba river, some twelve miles off; and they might probably be found still further south, were it not for the swampy character of the country. This southerly transportation is further con firmed by the boulders of the beach itself, which point to the north shore as their birth-place. This applies especially to the copper region west of Keweenaw Point. There trap and sandstone are the only rocks in place; and yet among the boulders scattered over the surface there are many of granite and hornblende, which have evidently their origin on the opposite shore, where we know these rocks to be very abundant. Thus it hap pen\u00a7 that, when travelling from south to north, the appearance of a new formation is always indicated by the occurrence of single boqlders of it, whilst nothing of the kind takes place when travelling from north to south. This precession of the boulders is especially striking among the ridges of the iron region north of Carp river, where there is often a great variety of structure in the rocks of the different ridges. There the val leys between the different ridges contain, for the most part, boulders from the next ridge to the north. There are also instances where a ridge did not allow the fragments of the preceding ridges to pass. A striking in stance of this has been observed by Mr. Hill west of the Jackson loca tion, where the slate and iron boulders are heaped up in great quantities on the northern slope of a greenstone dike, whilst there are none on the granite slopes south of this dike, which has therefore acted as a barrier, preventing their transportation further south. This limitation prevails, however, only within the hilly portion of the Lake Superior region, be tween the lake shore and the dividing ridge. South of the ridge nothing of the kind seems to occur. There being no further barrier to check their course towards the south, they have travelled even to the very limit of the drift deposite; and thus it happens that boulders of the Lake Su perior region are found as far south as the Ohio \u2014 that is to say, more than six hundred miles from the dividing ridge, the nearest place from which they could possibly be derived. We think, therefore, that there is satis factory reason to consider the region of Lake Superior, and especially the rim of cliffs and hills which surrounds its basin, as the birth-place of the greatest quantity of boulders scattered over the western States of the Union between the Alleghany mountains and the Mississippi; and from this consideration, the region of Lake Superior, more than any other, de serves a close attention on the part of the geologist who attempts to solve the problem of the drift of this country: By far the greatest quantity of boulders on Lake Superior, as well as elsewhere, are situated on the sur- face, above all other drift deposites. This, of course, is in itself a proof that they have been deposited posteriorly to these formations. But be-"], [223, "Doc. No. 69. 193 cause they are of a more recent origin, this does by no means prove that they are disconnected from the other drift deposites. We have seen that an abundance of boulders are to be found both in the drift clay and sand of Lake Superior. The only difference between them is, that whilst those of the surface are often more or less angular, those imbedded in the \u2022clay and sand are generally more rounded, and often scratched and striated\u2014 a peculiarity which we shall afterwards attempt to explain Now, as the boulders within the drift are of the same kind as those of the surface, and have, like them, a northern origin, (though sometimes not a great way off,) we are naturally led to the inference that they were transported by the same agencies, which must, therefore, have been at work during the deposition of the drift period. Moreover, this agency must have been as powerful at the time of the drift and clay deposites as afterwards, since we know that many of the included boulders are as mas- sive and as heavy as those of the surface. It is evident, therefore, that no theory can be admissible which does not at the same time account satisfactorily for the transportation both of the boulders of the surface and of those of the drift-sand and clay. 5. Grooved, scratched, and polished rocks.\u2014 Whatever opinion we may entertain as to the cause and origin of the drift, there is a point upon which all geologists who are familiar with the subject agree, viz: that there is an unquestionable connexion between the drift-deposites and the rounded, smoothed, and grooved appearance of the rocks upon which they rest. Wherever drift occurs, it is associated with that peculiar appear- ance of the ledges, which is instantly recognised. The surfaces are the more perfect, as the rocks, are harder and less prone to disintegration. Thutino-irdistricttheyaremostdistinctonthetrapandcompactslates; less so on the granite and compact limestone; and are not expected to be found on the sedimentary limestones. In many places the stri\u00e6 and furrows have disappeared in consequence of the disintegration, and there remains nothing but the rounded outline of the rocks, which, from their resem- blance to fleecy clouds, have been called, in the Alps, fleecy rocks. In many instances the polished and grooved surfaces are concealed by the drift, and are not visible until by some means the deposite is removed. This explains sufficiently why so general a phenomenon should have been for so long a time overlooked by geologists; for it is only about forty years since it was first mentioned, and only ten years since it was brought into general notice. One striking peculiarity of the rocks subjected to erratic agency consists in the fact that, whilst one side is smoothed down, the oppo- site side is rough and angular, as if it had been sheltered from the abrading process. These are known as the lea and strike sides. By means of this feature we are enabled lo recognise the direction in which the erratic agency operated, even where there are no scratches. The lea side is invariably to the south over the whole of this district\u2014 a feature which we ought to expect, when we consider the origin of the groovings. As a leading feature of all groovings, we may mention their straight course. Whatever the direction, they are in stiaight lines, whether con tinuous or interrupted \u2014 thus showing that they must have been formed by an agency unyielding and steadily applied. There, is but one instance where curved stri\u00e6 have been observed in this region, which will be no ticed hereafter. Groovings of all sizes occur. The most common form is that of paral- i\"j"], [224, "Doc. No. 69. 194 lei furrows from one to two and four lines wide\u2014 sometimes extending but a foot, at others many yards. Where the rock is excessively hard they are mere stri\u00e6, which are often as distinct and sharp as though they had been graven with the point ofa diamond. Hollow spots are observed, as though they had been scooped out by a round instrument; also, we ob serve wide bowl-shaped depressions, known as troughs, and which have been caused by the same agency, since they are always found parallel with the stri\u00e6. Instances of all these different forms exist on both shores of the lake and on Isle Royale. As to the direction of the stri\u00e6 in this district, it will be seen that, wish the exception of a few local deviations, they are northeast and southwest \u2014 a direction which also prevails along the western shore of Michigan, and in portions of the western States. This direction forms a striking contrast with that which prevails throughout New England. There, they bear northwest and southeast. We shall hereafter attempt to explain this singular opposition in the stri\u00e6 of the two regions east and west of the Allegha nies, and show their relation in determining the leading features of the continent. 6. Terraces and ridges. \u2014 The terraces and ridges of the great lakes have of late attracted a good deal of attention, inasmuch as they have a direct bearing upon the question of the changes of level which the sur face is supposed to have undergone during the epoch of the drift. They may be seen both on the south and the north shores of. Lake Superior, though they are less striking here than around the lower lakes, (Erie and Ontario.) Those of the north shore of Lake Superior have been de scribed by Mr. Logan. They are most conspicuous at a locality called \"Les Petits Ecrits,\" of which Mr. Eliott Cabot has given a fine sketch in his Narrative. Those of the south shore have thus far been but little noticed, probably because they occur chiefly in that portion of the iake-dis trtet which: is the least visited, viz: between the Saut and Keweenaw Poin}.. Beyond that point, there may be seen, in many places, along the shore of the copper region, high bluffs of drift; but they nowhere assume that stair-like form which is the characteristic feature of terraces. To avoid confusion, it might not be inappropriate to explain what is meant by the terms terrace, bluff, and ridge, as we shall have to allude frequently to them in the following descriptions. Drift-bluffs, or cliffs, are those accumulations of loose materials which terminate abruptly in steep slopes. The steepness of the slope depends in most cases chiefly upon the kind of materials of which the bluff is composed. Thus, bluffs of clay are steeper than bluffs of loam, and bluffs of loam steeper than bluffs of sand or gravel. The term, terrace, is applied when several such slopes are seen one above the other, so as to appear like the steps of a stair-case. Ridges differ from terraces in having a double slope, and being, therefore, real hills; whereas bluffs and terraces are merely the margins of plateaux. In a geological point of view, the terraces are by far the most imporiant of these three forms, since they afford direct evidences of the changes of level which have occurred since the deposition of the drift. There can be no doubt that, wherever terraces of stratified materials are found above each other, the waters have once stood at so many levels. It might be, and indeed it has been, inferred from this, that when terraces occur along a shore, they ought to be found everywhere of the same size; and hence, that when their level is irregular, it is a proof that the up-"], [225, "Doc. No. 69. 195 toeaval was not uniform. This view, although correct in principle, is, however, apt to lead to mistakes when applied without discrimination. Fig. 41. Suppose diagram 41 to repre sent a lake. Let the water sink, lor rather the land rise, at different I intervals, so as to reduce succes i sively the water-level from a to b, | and then from b, to c. The beach- line, (provided there be one,) striking the shore in an uninterrupted manner, will be found everywhere at the same level; but it by no means follows that the resulting terraces will be found uniform around the whole lake. The error in this respect arises from the fact that terraces have been too often mistaken for, or confounded with, mere beaches. It should not be lost sight of that terraces and bluffs are the result of the undermining action of the waves. Their size and shape must therefore be determined by the force of this agency. If a basin of water is so situated as to have one of its shores exposed to the full force of gales, while the opposite shore is sheltered by highlands, we may easily conceive of a subsidence of the waters from a higher to a lower level, without at all altering the slope of the Goast: as, for example, on the left side of the basin, b, in diagram 41. In the mean time, the right shore, not being protected, will be so acted upon as to occasion a succession of terraces. Again, the destructive action may be so effective in certain places as to wash off, in the course of time, even the terraces of former levels, and to leave only a single bluff, as indicated by the dotted line. There are many places along the lake shore where the peculiar shape of the terraces and their diversity are to be ascribed to such a process. The diagram 42 will render this still more evident. There can be no doubt that the water once stood at the foot of the upper terrace, m, and that, while stationary, the upper bluff was formed. Afterwards, Fig. 42, the water-level sank, and another bluff was formed at n, and, still later, another at o. The subsidence of the water must have been intermittent \u2014 the epochs of subiidence, which are indicated by the areas between the terraces, being followed by intervals of quiet, during which the terraces were formed. But this regular succession of terraces does not extend far. It is limited to a small space in our diagram; and, as we advance towards the left, we see the intervals between the terraces growing more and m\u00a9re narrow, till they completely disappear; \u2014 being, as it were, crowded into a single bluff B. Further on, we see the bluff itself increasing rap idly in height, and by-and-by disappearing entirely, leaving nothing but a gentle uniform slope, A. In the above instance, the circumstance that these different forms of terraces occur within a narrow space, and pass gradually into each other, excludes at once the idea of a local change of level. It must be evident to any one that they cannot but be the result of actual causes. But, should they occur at great distances,"], [226, "196 Doc. No. 69. such differences might easily lead to error. Let us suppose, for a mo ment, that we know the above terraces and bluffs merely from transverse sections, (such as represented in fig. 43:) would we not infer that the difference be tween the section, B, and section, A, resulted from the fact that B was raised higher than A, and likewise that B and A were both raised at once, whilst C was raised at three successive intervals?* Thus, not taking into account the action of the waves, and the po sition of the shores in reference to the predom inant winds, (as exemplified in diagram 49,) we might perhaps be induced to recur to ex travagant hypotheses, call in aid even the trap dikes, and other paroxysmal agencies, to ac- Fig. 43. count for features which are most readily explained by the mere play of meteorological agencies. rlowever, we do not pretend to assert that the upheavals which laid oare a great portion of the drift deposites have been uniform throughout. We know that there are, almost in every drift country, undoubted proofs of local changes of level afforded by the drift terraces; and we shall have occasion hereafter to refer to such an origin for those differences of level which are to be traced in an uninterrupted manner over vast tracts of country, especially along the sea shore. But we should be careful to call in such causes only when the phenomena cannot be otherwise explained. Ridges are often associated with terraces, and have frequently been con founded with them. They differ from terraces in being actual hills, rising from a plain, with a slope on each side. Sometimes they extend for a long distance along the shore of the sea, or an inland lake \u2014 as, for instance, Lakes Erie and Ontario, where they are commonly used as roads, being dryer than the surrounding grounds. From their situation, as well as their po sition, these ridges have the greatest analogy to ancient beaches, and there can be no doubt that many of them have no other origin. In that case they are the most reliable evidence for ascertaining local changes. Beaches have almost uniformly gentle slopes, rarely exceeding 12\u00b0; but there are among the ridges some which are too high, with slopes too, abrupt, to be considered as mere beaches. Since attention was first attracted to them in Sweden, where they go by the name of \u0153sars, (which mean sand hills,) I shall designate them henceforth by the.t name. There is every probability that they were form ed as shoais, or bars, or banks, under water, rather than on the border of the coast, since we know that such ridges are forming in our day in shallow water both in the sea and large lakes. It ought to be remembered that the summit of these submarine ridges is not always even, nor their bearing necessarily horizontal; so that a slight inequality in their outlines, especially if limited to a narrow space, does no more imply a local change of level than in the case of the terraces before mentioned. Since, from the :.-ature of things, raised beaches and \u0153sars are expected to occur in the \"Since the washing off takes place gradually, there is every possibility that the hluff B, 6, -,va\u00a3 once lower, and that there weie terraces indicating the former levels, (ib, ft, o,) as in section 0 .c , but that they have been washed away."], [227, "Doc.

A geologist who should limit himself to the examination merely of this portion of the coast, which is the most frequented, might well imagine that the drift deposite plays but a very subordinate part in this quarter. This impression, however, would soon vanish, if he were to proceed some distance on either side of the point. To the west of Eagle river, the coast is for many miles low, and composed of sand and gravel belonging to the alluvium of the lake. Beyond the Portage, the coast be gins again to rise, forming high and picturesque cliffs of sandstone, which, from their castle-like appearance, have been designated by Messrs. Foster and Whitney as the Red Castles. The tops of these cliffs are covered with a deposite of loose materials, composed of the detritus of the red sandstone, which, from its structure and the absence of all stratification, I am inclined to refer to the coarse drift, (although it is less coarse than on the cliffs of the Pictured Rocks,) and may be seen passing by gradual tran sitions into the red clay. Its average thickness does not exceed twenty feet. This range of sandstone cliffs extends for some ten miles, after which it disappears again ; and beyond Elm river we meet for the first time with high drift bluffs, rising boldly from the water to the height of from eighty to one hundred feet. These bluffs might easily be mistaken for sandstone cliffs, from their color and steepness. It is only when approaching closer to them that we become satisfied as to their real nature. The succession of the strata is as follows: at the foot of the cliff is seen rising from the water a stratum of red clay, very tough and sticky, some forty feet thick; above it a layer of sand from six to eight feet thick; still higher, another stratum of clay not more than a foot thick; and^ covering this, a mass of sand forty feet thick, which reaches to the top. Through the whole mass of the sand-, as well as of the clay, may be seen pebbles of different sizes; among them those of limestone are by no means rare \u2014 the presence of which may offer at first a difficulty, since there are nowhere in the neigh borhood limestone strata, in situ, from which they might have been de rived. But we shall see afterwards that there is no real difficulty in the way of explaining their origin, since that same limestone forms wide tracts \u25a0of country beyond the northern shores of Lake Superior. I noticed that"], [229, "Doc. No. 69. 199 ihese limestone pebbles were oftentimes accumulated in small layers near the top of the bluff. Among them were many fossils, which we found to belong, without exception, to the Cliff limestone. Between these bluffs and the Ontonagon river, the coast is for the most part low, and lined with shingle beaches. The drift appears only in a few places upon some low sandstone cliffs. My own observations do not thus far extend beyond the Ontonagon; but, according to Mr. Whitney, there appear again drift bluffs similar to those just described, and of equal height, between Presqu' isle river, and Black river \u2014 also, between the latter and the Montreal river. In both places they agree in composition and structure with those first described. There are, besides, high drift bluffs to be seen on several of the Apostle islands, and also west of these islands, where they are said to attain in some places a height from 400 to 600 feet. Though the whole mass is generally designated as clay, yet there is but little doubt that, on closer examination, there may be found also layers of sand above the clay. The thickness of the drift-strata along the lake shore, including both drift-clay, gravel, and sand, does not, however, give a correct idea of its extent further inland. In ascending the rivers which empty into the lake, we generally find the drift mass increasing considerably in thick ness. Tims, for example, at the Cushman location, on the Ontonagon, the bluffs of drift may be seen rising to the height of 125 feet above the bed of the river. I noticed that there were also more pebbles and boulders interspersed through the mass, and the distinction between sand and clay seemed less striking. The whole mass may, in some places, be called a sandy loam, and seems to indicate, on the whole, a less regular and quiet action. It is seen leaning against the trap ranges on which the Minne sota location is situated, and the upper sandy layers may even be traced almost to the top of the ridge. The annexed section, fig. 44, will give an approximate idea of their disposition in the vicinity of the Ontonagon. Fig. 44. dt, drift-sand ; <lc, drift-clay ; S, sandstone; T, trap. The Minnesota trap ridge rises like an island from the surrounding drift plateau and breaks off precipitously to the south. From this range, the eye embraces within its scope the great longitudinal valley bounded by the granite range on the south and the trap range on the north. The whole country is covered with drift deposites, through which the different branches of the Ontonagon and Slurgeon have cut deep ravines, forming bluffs which are still higher than those before mentioned. Pebbles of all sizes, and large boulders are seen scattered through the mass, and among them are found occasionally some of native copper. The limit of the drift to the south has notas yet been accurately ascertained. It reaches, accord ing to Mr. Whitney, as far as the sources of the Ontonagon; and, since the dividing line between the northern and southern slope is not very prominent, we may well suppose that it spreads in an uninterrupted man ner in that direction On the whole, however, the distribution of the drift west of Keweenaw Point is not so irregular as might appear when seen from the shore. There are wide tracts of coast which are bordered"], [230, "200 Doc. No. 69. by shingle beaches, and sometimes by dunes; but these are only on the margin, and we need not go far inland to find the drift-bluffs. Even where the coast is rocky and destitute of any kind of loose materials \u2014 as, for example, at Copper Harbor\u2014 this want of drift is only an exception, ap plying merely to the immediate vicinity of the lake; and we have only to cross the first ridge to find it again. Keweenaw Point, from its projecting position, is exposed to the most violent action of the gales and waves, and we may indeed easily con ceive of its shore being deprived of all loose materials. Nor is it the only place where this occurs; almost all the projecting points west of it are likewise more or less barren; but in many places the drift bluffs which line the intervening bays may actually be seen rising behind the rocky promontories. There is but little doubt that, if the country were cleared of woods, there would be seen along the whole southern coast of lake Su perior a line of drift-bluffs, in some places approaching close to the lake, in others receding more or less from it, but yet forming a continuous ter race, more or less elevated. As to the boulders of this part of the country, they are found scattered at all levels, not only over the whole surface of the drift plateau, but also over the different trap ridges, where the drift clay and sand do not reach. I was shown, by Mr. Knapp, a boulder of granite five feet long and two feet high, resting on the very top of the highest knob of the Minnesota trap ridge. This boulder has preserved its angular shape, being hardly worn at all. There is every probability that boulders. are likewise found on the highest elevations of the country, and continue without interruption from one slope of the dividing ridge to the other, as observed in several places further to the east. As far as their mineralogical composition is concerned, most of the boulders belong to the igneous rocks, viz: granite, gneiss, trap, and hornblende. There is but little doubt that in this portion of the country they are for the most part, if not exclusively, derived from the northern shore of the lake, since, with the exception of some trap dikes, there are no similar rocks along the \"lake west of Keweenaw Point. It might be asked, have they not been derived from the dividing ridge between the upper peninsula and Wisconsin, since we know that granite occurs there? But this would suppose a transportation from south to north, \u2014 an analogy not observed else where. The absence or scarcity of sandstone boulders should not sur prise us, if we consider that this rock is much softer and more easily de composed; its debrishas probably been ground to powder, and formed the elements of the drift-sand and clay, while the trap and primitive rocks have furnished the boulders and pebbles. Glacial furrows and scratches are very scanty in this part of the country. I have noticed them only in one locality, viz: on the road from Eagle river to the Cliff mines; they are on trap rock, and run north 15\u00b0 east. Drift phenomena os Isle Royale. \u2014 One of the most prominent features of Isle Royale, which cannot fail to strike any traveller coming from the south shore, is the almost toial absence of drift deposites \u2014 the shore be ing everywhere composed of barren rocks. With the exception of some patches of coarse drift which are said to occur near the western extremity of the island, there are no other quarternary deposites to be seen, if we except some boulders which belong partly to the alluvium, and partly to the drift. I consider, as belonging to the alluvium, those boulders which are seen in several places accumulated near the water's e^dge, along the southern shore of the island. As an instance, I would mention those"], [231, "Doc. No. 69. 201 which occur at the Siskawit Company's location, a few miles east of Rock Harbor. The boulders are here very much crowded, so as to cover almost entirely the ground for some distance; but they are limited to the immediate vicinity of the shore, not reaching higher than twenty feet. They are of moderate size, from one and a half to three feet in diameter, generally rounded and worn. In examining more closely into their com position, I found them to be for the most part trap, of the varieties known as sienitic, amygdaloid, and varioloid, with some few conglomerate and sandstone blocks \u2014 all of which occur on the island itself. This, together with their limitation to the immediate vicinity of the shore, leads me to believe that they belong, like those of the Saut, to the alluvium. Boulders are much less numerous in the interior of the island; and the opinion was even entertained by some that they were entirely wanting. In crossing the island, however, along the first tier of sections in range 37, I succeeded in detecting a granite boulder in the vicinity of Lake Desor, between the second and third ridge, at a height of 2Q0 feet. Others have been found in similar positions near the eastern extremity of the island, by Mr. Foster, at a height nearly as great. Scanty as they may be, they afford, nevertheless, a proof that the same agency which scattered the boulders over the slopes and terraces of the south shore had also operated here; and, since there is no granite to be found on the island itself, there can hardly be doubt that they have been derived, like the granite boulders of Keweenaw Point, from the Canadian shore, where it occurs in great quantities. Polished and scratched surfaces.- \u2014 If drift deposites are scanty on Isle Royale, the phenomenon of the erratic scratches and furrows is the more apparent. The trap ledges being hard, the markings have been pre served with great distinctness; and these are rendered still more con spicuous by the denudation of the drift. I noticed particularly the pol ished appearance of the rocks along the eastern portion of the southern shore of the island. The best opportunity for a detailed examination of the glacial phenomena, however, is afforded at the eastern extremity of the island, where several narrow spits or promontories project into the lake. One of these is Scovill's Point; it is rather narrow, with a gentle slope on the south side, whilst the northern is very abrupt. The whole promontory is entirely barren; so that all the peculiarities of the surface, with its gentle swellings and deep, trough-like depressions, maybe easily embraced in a single glance. Mr. Whitney and myself were struck with the close resemblance which these rounded and barren spots bore to some of the higher portions of the Alps: as, for instance, near the Grimsel. There is hardly a sharp angle to be seen on the whole promontory, ex cept where it is the result of recent disintegration. The trough-like de pressions are just as smooth as the knobs, and oftentimes filled with water, in which I collected several species of shells and a small fish \u2014 a species of shekel back. The glacial furrows, although greatly worn, were yet easily distin guishable in several places on the knobs, as well as in the troughs. I found their direction to be north 50\u00b0 east. Even the northern side of the promontory is here, in spite of its vertical slope, smoothed and polished, with distinct indications of stri\u00e6, showing that the grooving agency has acted on both slopes at once. This is owing, no doubt, to the circum stance that the direction of Scovill's Point coincides precisely with that of"], [232, "202 Doc. No. 69. the stri\u00e6, whereby both sides came under the influence of the furrowing agency, whilst in other places there is but one side which has been acted upon \u2014 the other (the lea side) being sheltered. The whole northern shore of Isle Royale maybe considered as one continuous lea side, in refer ence to the furrowing agency. Indeed, no sooner has the last promontory of the island been turned, than the rounded and polished appearance ot the rocks disappears entirely. The shore, for the most part, presents nothing but high, steep, and rough walls of trap, without any indication whatever of a glacial agency, except on some of the isolated islands, whose sides are occasionally smoothed, but only on their southern slope. Aster having turned the western extremity, and passed Washington Harbor, we meet again with smooth and rounded surfaces; but, from the nature of the rocks, they are less conspicuous. The shore being com posed here of sandstone and conglomerate, it is not expected that they would have resisted the disintegrating influence of the atmosphere as well as the trap. Yet there are undoubted traces of glacial action even on the conglomerates, whose surfaces appear rounded and smoothed, all the pebbles being generally reduced to the same level. In some cases, there may also be seen indications of furrows on the sandstone, and even on the conglomerate. Further east, towards Siskawit bay, where the sandstone disappears and the trap again sets in, (see the map of Isle Royale in Messrs. Foster & Whitney's report,) the scratches and furrows resume their distinctness. Chippewa harbor deserves in this respect a special notice. It appears, at first, as a mere notch in the outer trap ridge, its back ground being limited by a wall of highly polished surfaces of a very stri ing appearance. There are also seen in several places distinct marks of stri\u00e6 and furrows, which show the same direction as those described previously at Scovill's Point; namely, north 50\u00b0 east. The most promi nent, however, are on the lest side, immediately at the entrance to the harbor, where there may be seen not only stri\u00e6 and furrows, but also powerful excavations, some ten feet deep, and from twelve to fifieen wide, extending sometimes from fifty to one hundred feet in length. There are, besides, in the background of the harbor, fine instances of rocks, polished and worn by the mere action of the waves, which form a curious contrast with the glacial surfaces above, beingundulating and scooped out in every possible manner, whilst the latter are remarkably uniform. The develop ment of the furrows and stri\u00e6 .within this harbor is the more remarkable as the rocks outside show not the leastindicationsof similar phenomena \u2014 the ledges along the coast being, on the contrary, very rough and broken. This can be accounted for only by supposing that these rocks, which are now so broken and irregular, were once just as perfectly smoothed and polished as those within the harbor; but that, being brittle, and exposed to the most violent action of the waves and gales, they have been destroyed; whilst others, being more sheltered, have retained their primitive beauty. There may also be seen in the background of Chippewa harbor an accu mulation of angular boulders, which must have been stranded thereby ice very recently, for they are observed heaped up around large trees, which certainly have not grown in this condition. Finally, Isle Royale affords many instances of strange local deviations in the distribution of the stri\u00e6. On the shores of Ackley bay I found on the trap ledges, stri\u00e6 running due east and west, and crossing others whose direction was northeast and southwest, and others agaiu running south 75\u00b0 east. 1 noticed further,"], [233, "203 Doc. No. 69. that all the stri\u00e6, although very distinct, were limited to a narrow space, not exceeding two feet above the surface of the water, and not reaching more than 1^ feet below, whilst the barren ledges above, although rounded and smoothed, did not show any dis tinct stri\u00e6 or furrows. In this case we may well be induced to ascribe their origin to the action of the ice driven by the wind on the shore, and rubbing against the rocks \u2014 some times in one direction, sometimes in another. See figure 45. Fig. 45. The question may be asked, how it happens that, being situated in the middle of the drift regioh, Isle Royale affords so few traces of it? I will not conceal that this is a difficulty, since, although the island is very hilly, yet the ridges nowhere exceed six hundred feet \u2014 a height at which drift sand and even drift clay are found almost everywhere on the main land. We must either suppose that there has never been any drift on the island, or else that it once existed and has been afterwards removed. The first supposition would seem the most natural, were it not for the few erratic boulders which are scattered over the ridges, and which in this case would have been the only materials that the drift agency dropped. Now, it is difficult to conceive how boulders should be isolated in this single place, whilst they are everywhere else connected. Is it not reasonable to sup pose that the island has undergone a general denudation, whereby all the loose materials have been swept away, with the exception of a few boul ders which remain as witnesses of the glacial agencies? At any rate, we ought to remember that this, is not the only spot where such absence-, of drift occurs. The extremity of Keweenaw Point, as we have previously shown, is likewise barren of drift deposites; and here, at least, the sup position of a subsequent denudation seems to be beyond all doubt. Drift deposites east of Keweenaw Point. \u2014 The shore of Lake Superior east of Keweenaw Point may be divided, as far as the drift is concerned, into three distinct regions, in each of which it assumes a peculiar character, and is connected with, or dependent upon, the orographical structure of the country. These regions are \u2014 1st. The granite and iron region, extending from the Anse to the mouth of Chocolate river. 2d. The sandstone region, extending from Chocolate river to Grand Sable, and including the beautiful cliffs of the Pictured Rocks. 3d. The sand region, extending from Grand Sable to the Saut, where no other than quarternary formations are to be seen. Drift of the granite and iron region. \u2014 The granite region near the Anse, and the adjoining iron region back of Carp river, are both distin guished by their hilly character, being composed of a succession of ridges running from NE. to SW., and rising to higher and higher levels towards the anticlinal axis. The projecting spits and promontories are generally des titute of drift deposites, but the intervening bays are lined either by a drift terrace or by shingle beaches of alluvial materials. That portion of the lake shore between Granite Point and Chocolate river is particularly interesting. For a long distance, especially in the vicinity of Carp river, it is lined by a rather low terrace of drift, rising from twelve to eighteen feet above the"], [234, "Doc. No. 69. 204 water and composed of sand and gravel, sometimes distinctly stratified, with specimens of cross-stratification, and sometimes containing a great many large pebbles and boulders, so as to resemble coarse drift. In some places to the west of Carp river, near Worcester, the red clay is also to be seen cropping out from the base of the terrace, where its presence is usually accompanied by numerous springs. In the rear of the first ter race, there is found another much higher, rising from fifty to one hundred and fifty feet above the level of the lake. The latter is. sometimes close by the lower terrace, and sometimes it is separated from it by a space more or less remote. The figures 46, 47, and 48' will show the relative position of the two terraces at three differ ent points, between Worcester and the mouth of Carp river, within the distance of a mile. As to its structure, the upper terrace seems to be composed altogether of sand finer tharr that of the lower terrace, and with fewer pebbles and bould ers interspersed through it. If we now ascend the upper ter race, in order to explore the country inland, along one of the section lines, we find the following features. The top of the terrace is a plateau, covered Fig. 46. Fig. 47. Fig. 48. generally with fine forests, without much undergrowth \u2014 the predominating trees being maples, interspersed with large hemlocks, white pines, and sometimes' birches and aspens. This plateau, which would ho doubt afford an excellent soil for agriculture, rises with a slight slope towards the south, till we reach the first of the rocky ridges running from NE. to SW. where the drift thins out; the summit of the ridge itself being gene rally destitute of it, while boulders and furrows are of frequent occurrence. This, however, is not the limit of the drift to the south, for it appears again beyond the ridge, where it forms either another plateaux, if the next ridge is at some distance, or fills up merely a valley, if the two ridges are close to each other. A succession of rocky hills and drift plateaus or valleys are thus to be traced almost to the highest elevation of the country \u2014 near the dividing ridge, each following plateau or valley being commonly at a higher level than the preceding. In many places, the drift has been greatly washed off, and it is hot un usual to find the margin of the upper terraces scooped out in deep gullies, which are oftentimes to be traced for a great distance along the smallest rivulets. These gullies are very striking in the vicinity of the mouth of Carp river, where they reminded me of similar ones in the detrital de posites of Switzerland, which go by the name of unaids sauvages.\" They afford sometimes an excellent opportunity to investigate the nature of the drift. By far the greater portion of the drift deposite here, as well as along the shore, is composed of sand. There may be seen, however, in several localities, distinct traces of clay \u2014 as, for instance, near Teal"], [235, "Doc. No. 69. 205 * lake. Boulders are found scattered over the whole surface of the drift de posites, as well as on the ridges deprived of it. Some granite boulders have been observed by Mr. Hill even on the summit of Silver mountain, fourteen miles southwest of L'Anse, at the height of one thousand feet above the lake. Similar ones were noticed by Mr. Whitney and myself, inland from Carp river, at a height of 900 feet. There may also be seen, on the drift terraces of this region, indications of narrow ridges, composed of gravel and pebbles, similar to the \u0153sars which occur along the coast of Sweden. One striking instance of such \u0153sars, or ridges, may be seen on the road leading from the Jackson landing to Teal lake, a few miles from the shore. There can be but little doubt that, if the country was cleared of woods, such ridges would be noticed in many other places, for they seem to accompany the drift wherever it occurs in extensive tracts. The color of the drift (of the sand as well as of the clay) is that same reddish-yellow which prevails west of Keweenaw Point, over the whole of the copper region. There, it seems natural that it should have this color, for it rests almost everywhere on red sandstone, from which it is supposed to have been derived. Here, in the iron region, on the con trary, where the prevailing rocks are black slate, dark greenstone, and ridges of iron ore, it is evident that the drift cannot owe its origin to the decomposition of these rocks, for, in that case, it would necessarily be black, or at least very dark-colored. There is no other rock to which it can be referred ; but, since sandstone occurs here in the immediate vicinity of the lake shore, the presence of red drift to the south affords additional evidence that not. only the boulders, but the drift sand and clay, have been transported from north to south. Polished and grooved surfaces of the granite and iron region. \u2014 With tire exception of Isle Royale, the phenomenon of the polished and grooved surfaces is nowhere more frequent and striking than in the granite and iron regions. It is met with along the shore wherever a rocky spit pro jects into the lake, and in the interior wherever a ridge rises above the common level of the drift plateau, or where the drift has been removed. This frequency is owing to the fact that most of the rocks of that region, and especially those which occupy a prominent position, are very hard, and, therefore, have preserved most of the marks which have been stamped upon them. by the so-called erratic agencies. Indeed the rocks are not only smoothed and polished in most places where they appear at the surface, but also distinctly grooved and scratched. Along the coast, east of the Anse, scratches, furrows, and grooves may be seen in several localities. According to Messrs. Foster & Whitney, all the ledges of granite and hornblende between Granite Point and Dead river are distinctly smoothed and scratched. An island immediately east of Dead river is especially remarkable in this respect. The rock, which is very hard and tough hornblende, is not only grooved and furrowed over its whole extent, but there are, besides, deep, trough-like depressions, with perfectly smoothed walls, some twelve to fifteen feet long, four feet wide, and 'two and a half deep. Mr. Foster observed there two systems of stri\u00e6 \u2014 one running north and south, and the other north 20\u00b0 east and south 20\u00b0 west, the latter system being the deepest and most distinct. Similar troughs were observed by Mr. Foster on Middle island, east of Granite Point. Here, too, may be seen troughs sour feet wide and two feet deep, running, like the stri\u00e6, north 20\u00b0 east."], [236, "206 Doc. No. 69. The localities, however, where I found the stri\u00e6 the most distinct, are the promontories and islands near Worcester, two miles west of the mouth of Carp river. The rocks are a very tough hornblende and chlorite slate, which seem well fitted to preserve even the finest lines. There may be seen, near the mouth of a rivulet, several ledges whose northern slope is covered with stri\u00e6 as distinct as if they had been engraved but yester day. Indeed, with the exception of some localities on the black limestone in the Vinoasky valley, Vermont, and some others on the slates in the fiord of Christania, (Norway,) I do not remember having ever seen glacial stri\u00e6 so distinct. The figure 49 represents a ledge with a slope of from 10\u00b0 Fig. 49. to 20\u00b0 at the water's edge, where they are the most conspicuous. \u2014 There are two distinct sets of stri\u00e6: those running north 55\u00b0 east are the most numerous; those running north 5\u00b0 east the least. The latter are dis tinctly seen crossing the others, and are, therefore, more recent. Some of them are, besides, distinctly curved, as if the body which produced them had been deflected in ascending the slope \u2014 a peculiarity not yet observed elsewhere. Both sets of stri\u00e6 extend here but a little way below the water \u2014 generally not deeper than one foot. This is the most eastern point where stri\u00e6 occur along the shore, and, therefore, the first which comes under* the observation of geologists, when coasting west. H he stri\u00e6 and furrows are not less con spicuous in the interior of the country, and may be traced at all heights, and on all kind of rocks, in the neighborhood. I found them 500 feet high on the summit of the quartz ridge in the immediate vicinity of Carp river; 750 feet on the iron ridge south of Teal lake; and as high as 1,000 feet on a greenstone ridge near the water-shed. Among the most remarkable are the stri\u00e6 on the quartz, if we consider the very great hardness of the rock; and, indeed, with the exception of some quartz veins among the granite of the Alps, I know of no other localities where the stri\u00e6 may be traced for any considerable extent on this rock. The surfaces of these quartz hills are in some places so smooth as to glitter like mirrors in the sun, and may thus be seen from far. The rock is too hard to allow deep furrows; the groovings are, therefore, merely very fine stri\u00e6, but of such distinctness that one would think them to have been engraved by the point of a diamond. Their direction on the nearest quartz ridge is, according to Mr. Whitney, north 20\u00b0 east; but on the second ridge (at a height of 531 feet) I found their direction to vary between 25\u00b0 and 30\u00b0. No geologist can look at stri\u00e6 on such a rock without being convinced that the action of the water is utterly insuf ficient to produce such effects. The same inference may be drawn from the polish and stri\u00e6 at the top and along the sides of a very remarkable knob of conglomerate-quartz in township 27, range 25. Notwithstanding the variable hardness of the pebbles of which this conglomerate is composed, the stri\u00e6 on it may be traced in an uninterrupted manner sometimes for a distance of several feet, passing successively over a pebble of granite, of hornblende, of slate, of greenstone, and of iron ore. Their average direction"], [237, "Doc. No. 69. 207 is north, varying from 50\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 east. Stri\u00e6 are also to be seen on the iron ridges, sometimes on almost pure iron ore\u2014 as, for instance, on a ridge along the road leading to the Jackson location, two miles south of Teal lake. Their direction, as far as we could ascertain without a compass, (which is of course unreliable here,) is north 50\u00b0 or 60\u00b0 east. Finally, I would make mention of a green magnesian rock, with vertical walls, to the east, along the road leading fipm the Jackson landing to Teal lake. The walls, although almost semi-cylindrical, are covered with stri\u00e6 which may be traced along the surface, like hoops around a gigantic cask' Fig. 50. This is an important instance, since it goes to show that the stri\u00e6 could not possibly have been made by an iceberg, or any other body floating in the water, but that the agency must have been such as to conform to the direction of the rocky wall. As a whole, the direction of the stri\u00e6 in the several localities where they have been ob served within the granite and iron region are as follows: Main Secondary direction. direction. On Middle island, east of Granite Point - IS. 20\u00b0 E. On an island, east of Dead river - - N. 20\u00b0 E. N.\u2014 S. At Worcester .... N. 55\u00b0 E. N. 5\u00b0 E. On the first quartz ridge, one mile from the mouth of Carp river - - - N. 20\u00b0 E. On the quartzose conglomerate knob, town- ship 47, range 25 - - - N. 50\u00b0 60\u00b0 E. On the Iron ridge south of Teal lake - N. 55\u00b0 E. At the Jackson forge - - - N. 65\u00b0 E. Although there is considerable variation in the direction of the stri\u00e6 and furrows, yet we cannot fail to notice that they all run east of north, whilst we have thus far seen none running west of north. The direc- tion northeast and southwest seems to be the prevailing one, especially on the ridges in the interior. It is also, as we have seen, the prevailing one on Isle Royale. Alone the shore the direction seems somewhat more northerly, (N. 20\u00b0 25\u00b0 east,) corresponding to that observed on Kewee naw Point. Finally, where two sets are seen crossing each other \u2014 as, for instance at Middle island \u2014 the northerly direction has thus far proved to be the more recent one. Drift os the sandstone region east of Keweenaw Point. \u2014 The sandstone region east of Keweenaw Point extends from the mouth of Chocolate river to Grand Sable \u2014 more than sixty miles \u2014 including the high range of the Pictured Rocks. .From Chocolate river to Traine river, for a distance of twenty five miles, the shore is bordered with low, alluvial deposites, with pebbly beaches and hillocks of blown sand. Three small rivers empty into the lake along this coast, nearly at equal distances from each other, viz: Fish river, Laughing-Fish river, (Riviere du poisson qui rit,) and Pebble river, (Riv iere aux galets.) The rock in place is exposed to view only on a few pro montories; but the land rises considerably in the rear, and there is every"], [238, "208 Doc. No. 69. probability that, in following up any of these rivers, the drift may be en countered at no great distance. After having passed Pebble river, the sandstone intersects the shore, forming rather low bluffs, covered with a. deposite of drift-loam from five to ten feet thick. Then the ground rises* suddenly to the height of nearly one hundred feet. We noticed that its slope was covered with a strange mixture of detrital materials, composed of huge angular fragments of sandstone and of rounded granite boulders, giving it the appearance of a vast accumulatioji of very coarse drift. Having landed there, I soon noticed regular sandstone strata beneath the detrital covering, and satisfied myself that this strange mixture was owing to the disintegration of a soft layer of sandstone near the top of the cliff, which, in scaling off, had caused the layer above to crumble down, together with the deposite of drift which caps the summit.\" The drift at the top of the cliff attains here a thickness of twenty-five feet, and is remarkable for the quantity of large boulders which it contains. Beyond this point, the sandstone disappears again from the shore, and the coast is lined for some distance with a drift terrace from fifteen to eighteen feet in height, in every respect similar to that which we have described near Carp river. Traine* bay, which follows next, is lined with shingle beaches and dunes. Having ascended Traine river, which empties into this bay, we reached the drift terrace, after having threaded the innumerable wind ings of its channel, through a low and swampy plain, at a distance of only a few miles from the coast. The terrace averages from twelve to fifteen feet in height, and is com posed of a reddish sand, with many pebbles scattered through it The same drift-sand, although less loamy, prevails also around Traine lake, some five or six miles inland, above the mouth of the river. Beyond Traine bay, begins the range of the Pictured Rocks, the most romantic portion of the southern shore, extending some ten miles from Grand island eastward. Though highly attractive on account of its scenery, this region is less important in reference to the drift, which plays here but a very subordinate part. However, there is seen at the top of the high, towering bluffs a stratum of loose materials from ten to thirty feet in thick ness, composed of pebbles and boulders, intermixed with loam and sand. I consider this deposite, like that formerly described as occurring on the summit of the Red Castles, as belonging to the coarse drift. The most striking feature is derived from its structure, being composed almost ex clusively of fragments detached from the sandstone ledges beneath. Although imbedded in a kind of loam, the fragments are but little worn, whereby they differ essentially from the boulders and pebbles im bedded in the drift clay. After a careful examination of the materials in several, localities, I found but few foreign pebbles among them, chiefly fragments of trap. There are some few places, however, where a stratum of drift-sand may be seen covering the coarse drift. Such an instance occurs at the top of the Grand Portal. It was at first doubtful whether this stratum, which is very homogeneous, had not, perhaps, originated from blown sand from below ; but, on closer examination, I found that it contained a certain num ber of rounded pebbles, which rendered such a supposition inadmissible. * Traine is an antiquated French word, still in use an o lg the Canadian French, for traincav, a eleigh. We heard from one of our voyageurs that there had been, for a long time, an old sleigh mar the mouth of the river: hence probably its name."], [239, "209 Doc. No. 69. The average thickness of this sand stratum, at the top of the Pictured Rocks, does not exceed ten feet, although it is in some places as thick a? thirty feet. Along the whole range of the Pictured Rocks, there are but two locali ties where the high wall is interrupted so as to afford a safe landing-place, viz: at Miner's river and at Chapel river, near the Grand Portal. The first of these two rivers empties into the lake near a most picturesque pro montory, which Mr. Whitney calls Miner's Castle. To the east of this promontory extends, for the distance of nearly a mile, an alluvial plain, covered with ancient beaches. The drift appears at the surface, but there is little doubt that it may be found along the banks of the river. A con siderable layer of drift occurs on the top of Miner's Castle, composed of a whitish clay silled with pebbles and fragments of the underlying rock. At Chapel river, the high cliff is interrupted for the space of half a mile, where the coast is lined by a drift terrace some thirty feet in height, being the border of a plateau stretching for several miles inland, and covered with pine openings. There, I had a fine opportunity of examining the relation of the drift to the surrounding cliffs. At the western corner of the opening, the different sandstone strata are abruptly broken, some- times stair like and sometimes with bold projections. There, I saw drift not only cover ing the lower steps of this gi gantic stair-case, but filling, likewise, the space between the projections, as shown by the following diagram. It is obvi ous from this fact that the cliffs of the Pictured Rocks had alrea dy, atthe'time of the deposition of the drift, the same irregular and broken outlines which ren der them so now. Fig. 51. d, g. drift-gravel, s. sandstone. It is well known that the top of the Pictured Rocks is not a mountain nor a ridge, but merely the margin of a sandstone plateau, which rises heie abruptly to the height of nearly 200 feet. Having ascended the cliff, near Miner's river, we found the plateau almost level; yet, most of the rivulets, instead of emptying into the lake, run southward, so that the water-shed is here near the very margin ef the cliff. Although the sur face of the plateau is thickly wooded and partly covered with swamps even at its highest levels, yet wherever the soil is removed, we found the underlying rock to consist of sandstone, and it soon became evident to me that the drift plays but a very subordinate part, being confined merely to some scattered boulders and pebbles. No glacial furrows and groovings have been observed within this district, which is not to be wondered at, if we consider the nature of the prevail ing rock, being soft, and easily decomposable sandstone. DRIFT OF THE SAND REGION. This region, the most important as far as the drift is concerned, begins where the cliffs of the Pictured Rocks, after having sunk within a few feet 14"], [240, "210 Doc. No. 69. 'of the water's edge, are suddenly replaced by a high ridge of lose mate rials, called the Grand Sable. From thence, along the whole length of the coast, to the Saut, a distance of nearly one hundred miles, there is no other formation than drift and alluvial deposites to be seen. The latter is the most prominent; but wherever the drift comes close to the shore, it is generally in the form of high terraces, with abrupt slopes, exceeding even the highest points of the Pictured Rocks \u2014 e. g., at Grand Sableand Point Iroquois. The Grand Sable, from its peculiar and very striking appearance, de serves a more accurate description. The traveller, in coasting along the beautiful and thickly-wooded cliffs of the Pictured Rocks towards the Saut, after having seen the cliffs of sandstone gradually descend within a few feet of the water, is suddenly struck by the appearance of a high, naked wall rising immediately from the lake, and extending for many miles in an easterly direction. (See diagram 52.) The contrast afforded by such a barren tract in the midst of the dense forests which extend all around is in itself most remarkable \u2014 the more so as it seems, at first, to be nothing but a gigantic heap of loose sand. In deed, since Schoolcraft first described it as a dune, it has generally been thus represented by all subsequent writers. Besides, the fact that the cliffs of the Pictured Rocks to the west of Grand Sable are of a very loose and easily- decomposable sandstone, seemed to justify the idea that this high sand-ridge might be nothing but the detritus of decomposed sand stone strata, heaped up by the power of the northwest winds, which are known to be the prevalent ones on the lake. But yet, it seemed difficult to conceive that sand should accumulate to the height of 366 feet in that single spot, whilst at other places along the shore \u2014 for example, at White-Fish Point \u2014 the dunes should not reach higher than from forty to fifty feet, though the winds are equally violent. Even along the seacoast, under the influence of the oceanic gales, the dunes do not attain so great a height; for those of Provinqetown,on Cape Cod, which are certainly the most remarkable on this side of the Atlantic, do not exceed eighty feet. Having landed on the promontory at the entrance of the bay, bordered by the high, barren ridge, in order to investigate the subject more closely, we soon discovered along the partially naked cliffs a distinctly marked line, (a,) which was found to be the upper limit of the red clay. (See figure 52.) Fig 52. Above this clay was a mass of sand with in dications of horizontal stratification, which, from its appearance as well as from its position, we recognised as the drift sand. Taking this fact as a standard; we followed the cliff towards the east for some distance, and were able to recognise all along, the same rela tive position between the clay and sand. Thus, we ascertained that the dune-like appearance is owing merely to an external covering of loose sand, and that the main body of the ridge is made up of drift sand and clay, the latter ap pearing at the surface in some spots, which are indicated by occasional clumps of dwarfish trees. The Messrs. Whitney, having ascended to t' e top of the sand ridge in order to measure its"], [241, "Doc. No. 69. 211 height, found our suspicion entirely confirmed, for they disco\\rered at the very top, layers and masses of coarse pebbles resting upon the sand, and scattered through it. These, of course, could not have been blown up from below. They found the surface of the ridge very irregular, with deep hollows, and pre senting to the south a steep slope, similar to that facing the lake, and equally barren, but less high, being only fifty or sixty feet. Beyond, the surface of the plateau was again covered with trees. The question will be asked, therefore, how it happened that a mere ridge should be so bar ren, whilst along the shore the drift is covered with dense forests. The cause of this peculiar feature lies, no doubt, in the fact that the drift is here very loose and destitute of any loamy substance. If by any cause (wind falls or heavy rains) the vegetation be carried away, the sand remains ex posed to the wind, and, being very fine and dry, it is gradually blown off and scattered over the surrounding country. Of this we have direct proof in the isolated hillocks covered with trees which indicate the former level <of the plateau. These will probably aster a while also yield to the power of the elements. Meanwhile, they give us the measure of the amount of the materials which have been already taken off from the summit and scat tered over the surrounding country. There may be seen in many places along the slopes of the sand ridge of Grand Sable parallel lines \u2014 sometimes horizontal, sometimes bent and un dulated \u2014 which might at first be mistaken for lines of stratification. I am rather inclined, however, to consider them as indications of successive fallings of the sand coatings, which would take place when the slope be comes too great, as it happens with the snow on the steep slopes of the Alps. Another similarity between these sand slopes and the snow-covered walls of the high mountains, may be found in a peculiar fluted appearance resulting from the falling off of small particles in the same direction. Finally, there may be seen at the top of the long ridge of Grand Sable, towards the eastern extremity, some irregular hillocks, more or less an gular, which have all the appearance of genuine dunes, and which in all probability were heaped up in the same way. Between them and the true dunes there is only this difference, that the sand is derived from a higher spot, instead of a lower one. Between the eastern extremity of Grand Sable and Two-hearted river, a distance of nearly thirty miles, the lake shore offers but little of interest, being composed entirely of alluvium, covered and capped in many places with dunes. The drift terrace appears nowhere on the coast, but is gen erally seen lining the horizon at some distance. At Two hearted river it approaches the shore^ within less than a mile, and is composed of the same red sand as further west. It rises here to the height of fifty feet. At a distance of six miles east of Two-hearted jiver, another smaller river empties into the lake, known as Carp river, but, to avoid confusion, it has been designated on the map as Terrace river. There, the drift again approaches the shore, forming a succession of ter races, which deserve a special attention, as being the most striking instance of this peculiar structure along the south shore of Lake Superior. There are, in some places, not less than six successive terraces, which, when close to each other and combined with the beaches, appear from the lake, like a gigantic stair-case leading to the drift plateau above, rising to ,the average height of nearly one hundred feet \u2014 a height corresponding"], [242, "212 Doc. No. 69. to that of the upper terrace of Carp river, as described above. Mr. Whit ney, who measured the relative height and position of the terraces at a place two miles east of Two-hearted river, found the following succession: Height. 1. Gravel beach ..... 5 feet. 2. Sand beach - - - - - 12 \" 3. First drift terrace - - - - 29 ' \" 4. Second drift terrace - - - - 46 \" 5. Third drift terrace - - - - - 75 \" 6. Summit of plateau - - - - 94 \" The position of these different terraces, as well as their relation to each other, is represented in natural proportions in the diagram fig. 53. It will be seen that, although the distances of the four upper terraces are variable, yet their slopes are rather uniform , being on an average 30\u00b0. The slopes of the two lower terraces are, on the contrary, much less, being from 10\u00b0 to 12\u00b0\u2014 a circumstance inti mately connected with their origin, for they are true Fig. 35. beaches, having been actually built up by the action of the waves, whilst the upper ones indicate merely the denudating action which the drift un derwent \u2014 the crumbling down of the sand under the influence of the waves, when the relative level of the lake and the shore was different from what it is at present. The several terraces thus indicate, in all probability, as many periods of subsidence. Since the steepness of a slope depends chiefly upon the nature of the materials of which it is composed, it is to be expected that like materials will present a uniformity of slope; and thus it is that the slopes of all drift terraces are so constant. This constancy furnishes in itself a striking feature of the drift terraces, by which they are easily distinguished from mere beaches. The surface of the terraces is not always level, but undulating, and covered with ridges, as it appears from the above section. Some of these ridges \u2014 for instance, that marked o, in the section \u2014 are probably ancient beaches. Indeed it is easily conceivable that, if the coast of Lake Superior were to be raised some thirty or forty feet, the two alluvial terraces, which are now close to the water, would appear in the same manner upon the new terrace, whose slope would soon be the same as that of the upper ones. Beyond Terrace river, the drift terraces recede suddenly from the shore, and are not again seen until after having turned White-Fish Point, we reach the bottom of Tequamenen bay. Thus, the whole country in the vicinity of White-Fish Point, comprising an area of nearly two hundred square miles, and including the lower portion of Tequamenen river, is nothing but a low, alluvial and marshy plain, which owes its origin to the action of the prevailing winds and currents."], [243, "Doc. No. 69. 213 Point Iroquois is, as we have stated before, a high ridge rising imme diately from the water, and, in all probability, composed exclusively o'f drift materials. From thence, the drift terrace is seen skirting the shore along Waiska's bay as far as the Saut, where the Potsdam sandstone appears again below the drift deposites. There are, besides, in Tequamenen bay, several islands, which seem to be composed entirely of drift, containing a great many rounded boulders and pebbles, from which have been derived the stones used in the construction of the light-house at White-Fish Point. Iroquois island, opposite the point of the same name,' is made up of like materials. Here I noticed that a great proportion of the boulders aud pebbles were of sandstone, which leads me to believe that this rock must be in place somewhere in the neighborhood. Drift deposites along the St. Mari/s river. \u2014 The same drift terrace which we have described as skirting the southern shore of Lake Superior is here seen. At the Saut, it attains a height of nearly 100 feet, and is separated from the river by a level and swampy plain, destitute of any det rital materials except boulders, which repose on the sandstone. The ter race can be traced eastward \u2014 sometimes in the form of a regular plateau, and sometimes in that of irregular ridges \u2014 until lost sight of beyond the Neebish rapids. A corresponding one is observed on the British side, but of more limited extent, separated from the river by a similar plain, and bounded on the other hand by a chain of elevated hills. The phenomena of the glacial furrows are very marked in many places along the St. Mary's river. In the vicinity of the Neebish, the rocks are smooth aud rounded, as though polished artificially, and glitter in the sun like the finest polished surfaces of the Alps. The general direction of the grooves is N. and S., and the rocks exhibit a lea and strike side. Along the Straits of Mackinac the drift is rarely seen; but on the higher points of land, limited patches are observed. Its position on the island of Mackinac is particularly interesting, where it is restricted to the summit, forming a stratum 100 feet thick. Accustomed to observe the drift occupying only the lowest depressions, its position here at once arrests the attention. The following diagram illustrates its relation to the older rocks and to the alluvial terraces: Like the drift at the Saut, it consists of loamy sand, with- out any distinct stratification, intermixed in places with con- siderable clay. Coming from the lower lakes for the first time, where the clays are buff and blue, the geologistis in doubt as to the real position of these patches; Fig. 54. but, after having visited Lake Superior and examined the drift accumula tions, he has no \"doubt whatever. To Mr. Whittlesey belongs the credit of having first suggested the identity of the two deposites. As this clay is traced southerly-long the shores of Lake Michigan, it is found gradually passing into the blue clay of the west. Thus, the island of Mackmac, with its summits covered with drift, constitutes a most important link in the chain of evidence to identify remote deposites, as belonging to a common"], [244, "Doc. No. 69. 214 epoch. We are thus enabled to connect the drift deposites of Lake Superior with those which form the plateaux of Wisconsin and Illinois. The boulders on the island, which are numerous, rest upon, or are imbedded in, the drift. From their external characters, it is inferred that they were derived from the northern shore of Lake Superior. We can account for the peculiar position of the drift here, and its ab sence on Round island and Bois Blanc, only by supposing that it has been removed by denudation. The topographical engineers inform me that it is to be found on the high ground in the vicinity of Point St. Ignace. Hence, we infer that at one time it was spread over the entire area, and that a general denu dation has taken place to the height of nearly 200 fees. This denudating process, however, did not limit itself to the removal of the drift materials. The island affords evident proofs that the more ancient rocks have not escaped. That curious and picturesque rock known as the Sugar Loaf, which rises like a pyramid, to the height of ninety feet, from the surrounding plain, remains a monument of the ancient water-level. There can be no doubt that this denudation is to be ascribed to power ful currents of water, at a time when the general level of the country was different from what we now behold it. That these currents were long-continued, is proved by the many alluvial terraces which encompass the island, of which we shall treat hereafter. No glacial furrows have been observed on the island, or along the straits; but there is little doubt that such markings might be traced on the rocks, if the superficial mate rials were removed. The soft porous limestone which here prevails, ist ill adapted to retain such markings for any great length of time, when ex posed to the influence of atmospheric agencies. CONCLUSION. It is not intended here to give a general theory of the causes and origin of the drift, since it would oblige us to allude to many phenomena for eign to the district under consideration, and to discuss the many systems which have been proposed by various authors to solve this great problem. I shall, therefore, limit myself, for the time, to a brief sketch of the prin cipal periods which may be recognised among the drift deposites of Lake Superior. A mere glance at the relative position and structure of the drift deposites, as described in the foregoing pages, will suffice to prove that the phenomena neither indicate a paroxysmal agency, nor the operation of a single cause, however long continued. They disclose a long series of events, which have resulted from causes highly diversified, and as yet but imperfectly known. We recognise the following periods in the history of the drift of Lake Superior: 1. The period of the grooving and polishing of the rocks must be con sidered as the dawning of the drift epoch. At the close of the tertiary era, (which has left traces of its presence over many of the States border ing on the Atlantic, as far north as the island of Martha's Vineyard, in Massachusetts,) the whole northern portion of the continent was subject ed to the operation of a general and most powerful agency, of which there is no precedent in the history of former geological ages. Therffmay"], [245, "Doc. No. 69. 215 be found in every sedimentary formation, deposites similar in their compo- sition to those of the drift, but the rocks on which they rest are nowhere characterized by those peculiar markings which we have described as gla- cial furrows and stri\u00e6. In the region of Lake Superior, they are found at all levels \u2014 over plains, and on the slopes of the hills and mountains. Even the dividing ridge between the upper peninsula and Wisconsin exhibits traces of their action. It is proved that here, as well as in Europe, their main direction has been from north to south \u2014 being, however, sometimes de- flected either to the east or to the west. These deflections are, no doubt, de- pendent upon the leading physical features of the country. Along the south shore of Lake Superior we have found them running mostly from north- east to northwest, a direction parallel with that of the principal ridges \u2014 as, for instance, those of Isle Royale and Keweenaw Point. These coinci- dences would be still further strengthened, if it could be ascertained by a series of soundings across the lake, that the main troughs ran in the same direction. We know, in the actual operations of nature, of no agent capable of producing such a gigantic result as the shaving and smoothing of a whole continent. To those who are familiar with the effects produced by glaciers upon the walls and bottoms of the valleys through which they move, it cannot be denied that they exhibit the closest analogy to the phenomena which we have been describing. The appearance of the rocks, as well as the form and size of the stri\u00e6, is the same; yet it must be remembered that, in our days, glaciers occur chiefly in the valleys of the highest mountain chains. It is, therefore, difficult to conceive how they could exist aud move in a wide and level country, like the northern parts of the United States and Canada. In order to avoid this difficulty, it has been assumed that the whole northern hemisphere, as far as erratic phenomena reach, was once covered with a general cap of ice, similar to that of the circum polar region, which, in its southerly progression, is sup- posed to have at once smoothed the rocks and transported the boulders from north to south.* A careful examination of the position of the boulders, which I have found, both in this country and northern Europe resting mostly on stratified deposites of sand or clay, has convinced me that the above as- sumption is no longer admissible, so far as it relates to the transportation of the boulders. The remaining question relates to the grooving and polishing of the surface rocks. However inclined I may be, from personal observation of the glacial phenomena both in the Alps and Scandinavia, to refer the groovings to this agency, according to M. de Charpentier's theory, (which is also advocated by M. Agassiz,) I shall refrain from enter- ing into any discussion of the subject, for the reason that the laws which regulate the motion of the polar ice are as yet too little known to be made the basis of geological speculation in a report like this, the object of whicfr ie to state facts and give particular information. Whatever may have been the cause, of the groovings, it must be admitted that an agency which was capable of shaving off and wearing down such an extent of surface must also have been able to remove the detritus and to transport it from one place to another. I am inclined, therefore, to ascribe to this agency, and to consider as contemporaneous with it, that portion of drift materials which *As to the difficulty arising from the climate, I would remark that it has been most ingeniously shown, in a recent paper by M. Lecog, that if polar glaciers have ever existed in thess lati tudes, U was possible only with a higher temperature."], [246, "216 Doc. No. 69. I have described as coarse drift, and which, wherever it exists, is regu- larly found at the base of the stratified deposites, having been left undis i turbed by the waters of the subsequent period. 2. We have shown that almost everywhere along the southern shore of Lake Superior there is a stratum of red clay resting on the coarse drift, or, where this is removed, on the polished rocks. From its thickness and the comminuted state of the materials, we infer that during its deposition a long interval of time elapsed, characterized by no violent agitations. With this stratum begins the second era of the drift. If it should be proved that the continent stood, during the preceding period, at a higher level than now, as some phenomena seem to indicate, this circumstance . would afford additional evidence in favor of the separation of the two periods, since it would imply a subsidence of the continent, at the begin- ning of the deposition of the clay, by which the shores of the lake were brought within the reach of the waters to the height of the surface of the red clay. Admitting this, we must suppose that the former detritus was to a great extent swept away, and deposited in a more quiet manner. As to the boulders distributed through it, we may suppose that they were transported by floating ice, in the same manner as their transport is at this day effected every spring from the borders of the northern lakes and rivers, and dispersed over the adjacent swamps and low lands. The question recurs as to the nature of the waters \u2014 whether they were salt or fresh. Considering the vast area over which the clay is spread\u2014 it being traceable not only along Lake Superior, but also along the St. Mary's river to Mackinac, and thence along Lake Michigan to the prairies of Illinois \u2014 it would seem to have constituted a part of the ancient bed of the ocean. It should, however, be remembered that we have, in former geo- logical epochs, fresh-water formations extending over considerable areas, particularly during tertiary and carboniferous eras. At any rate, the question must remain doubtful, as long as we have no evidence of fossil remains. Thus far, I know of no type of animal or ve- getable life having ever been found in the clay of Lake Superior. 3. We have found everywhere resting upon the clay of Lake Superior a stratum of gravel and sand, which, notwithstanding its irregular struc- ture, is a real stratified deposite and must therefore be supposed to have been formed in water. Occurring at still higher levels than the drift clay, and attaining sometimes a thickness of several hundred feet, we must suppose that at the time of its deposition the country had subsided to a still lower level. From the diversity of its stratification we infer that this period was characterized by intervals of agitation and repose. According to Mr. H- D. RogerS's ingenious theory, this feature should be ascribed to the temporary operation of earthquake waves, such as are known to occur occasionally in our days, especially in the Pacific. Such waves might well have disturbed the bottom of the ocean, carrying before them an immense freight of detrital materials, which were heaped up in irregu- lar masses and hills, resembling the drift accumulations. If we suppose similar disturbances to have been of frequent occurrence, they might well account for the absence of all organic remains at that epoch. I consider, as belonging to the close of this period, the transportation of those huge boulders which are scattered in such vast profusion over the sur- face of the gravel deposites, and which we have detected on the very sum- mits of the anticlinal axis, where no other drift deposites occur. It might"], [247, "217 Doc. No. 69. thus appear, at first that this epoch had been characterized by more violent agitations than the preceding one. We should be careful, however, not to judge of the power and violence of an agency merely from the size of the materials transported; for, if the boulders had been conveyed by pow erful currents, we should not only find them of diminished size in their progress southward, but also rounded and smoothed like the smaller peb bles. On the contrary, we know that they are just as massive at the very limits of the drift in Ohio, as near their birth-place; besides, many of them along the anticlinal axis are perched, as it were, on the very top of nar row hills and knobs, where it is hardly admissible that they should ever have been left by a violent agency. Finally, many of them, in spite of con tradictory assertions, have rather sharp angles, as if they had been subjected to slight attrition. I am therefore inclined to suppose that the surface boulders, like many of those buried in the drift-clay and sand, have been transported by floating ice, (not icebergs.) By this hypothesis, their posi tion on the summit of the hills offers no longer any difficulty; for it is nat ural to suppose that they should have been stranded upon those points, which at the time were shoals. The changes of level which the region of Lake Superior has undergone during the drift epoch are represented in the following diagram. Assuming that, during the period of the groovings, the waters stood nearly at the same level as now, the land must have sunk during the sec ond period to the depth of five hundred feet, and again the same amount during the third period, when they reached those sum mits, which are now one thou sand feet above the lake. Fig. 55. The boulders of Lake Superior, like those of all other parts of the country, point to the north as the source of their origin; yet there is this difference, that they are not generally derived from far. Those in the immediate vicinity of the south shore have in the main been derived from the north shore, but as a whole, they are not very numerous; and I have Mr. Foster's authority for stating that very fe-w have passed beyond the dividing ridge. The boulders and pebbles of the opposite slope of the axis, although more numerous than on the northern slope, are all derived from the dividing ridge itself. The same is true to a great extent of those scattered over the plains and prairies of Wisconsin and Illinois. This ridge, abounding in eruptive and metamorphic rocks, is therefore to be considered henceforth as the true birth-place of the boulders scattered over the western States, and we need no longer recur to high northern latitudes to ascertain their origin. The drift epoch may be considered as closed with the transportation of the boulders. The waters, after having thus reached their highest level \u2014 during which the transport of the boulders and pebbles was accomplished \u2014 again subsided. With this subsidence commences the era of the alluvium. We have no reason, however, to suppose that the subsidence was sudden. Everything leads us to believe, on the contrary, that it was gradual, and that the same agencies continued to operate to a certain degree. Thus we may infer that beaches were formed, sand bars built up, and boulders transported, in the same manner as before, although at lower levels. Meanwhile, the former and higher"], [248, "213 Doc. No. 69. beaches receded more and more from the shores; the bars, shoals, and sub -marine banks appeared as ridges or oesars above the plains recently laid dry, whilst new ones were forming at lower levels; and whenever the water, in its receding movement, stood for a sufficient time at the same level to allow the new shore to be acted upon and undermined by the waves, these bluffs and terraces were formed, as shown before. Now, since terraces and ridges occur frequently along the great lakes, they may be considered as a conclusive proof that the subsidence was really gradual. In this respect, terraces and ridges, although composed of drift materials, belong properly to the alluvial period, as well as the denudations along the channels through which the waters are supposed to have been dis charged. I shall therefore examine them with more detail in my report upon the alluvium. Thus far, we are not aware of any striking geological event \u2014 such as the elevation of a mountain chain \u2014 having taken place between the two epochs of the drift and alluvium. It might therefore be asked if there is sufficient reason to separate them. There are, indeed, some geologists who question the propriety of such distinction. My chief motive in adopting it is derived from all of the drift phenomena, rather than from any single event. The drift is the last phasis of any importance through which the earth passed before it became fitted for the habitation of man. Were it not for these deposites, a great portion of this continent, including the district em braced in this report, would have been a waste of naked and barren rocks, covered partially with heaps of dry sand or rough detrital materials. Through the long-continued agency of water, these materials have not only been reduced and dispersed, but also mingled in such proportions as to afford a most appropriate soil for vegetable and animal life. When, afterwards, the rise of the continent caused the waters to recede within their present limits, they left behind them those wide, drift-covered plains, destined to become, in the lapse of time, the. seat of an industrious, in tellige\u00bbt, and prosperous nation. We think ourselves justified in con sidering the period, when the waters, after having done their work, began to recede, as the beginning of that new and grand era which has been properly called the era of man, and of which the alluvial period is the introduction."], [249, "Doc. No. 69. 219 GLOSSARY OF MINING AND METALLURGIC TERMS. For convenient reference, we have prepared the annexed glossary of the technical and provincial terms relating the science of mining and metal lurgy, which includes most of those in use in this country and in books treating of these subjects. The fact that a great number of Cornish and German miners are employed in our mines readily accounts for the intro duction of foreign, provincial and technical words, many of which are already in familiar use in the Lake Superior copper region; others are used in foreign works treating of mining and metallurgy, and have been adopted in English books, when we have no word expressing exactly the same idea. In the glossary, the letter C, affixed to a word signifies that it is of Cornish origin; F, follows a term adopted from the French, and G, from the German language. GLOSSARY.

Sir: We transmit to you our second and final report on the geology of the Lake Superior Land District, accompanied with sections and illustra tions, and a general map on which the range and extent of the several systems of rocks are defined. Our observations have been extended over an area of little less than one hundred thousand square miles ; and, although the whole of this area is not strictly within the limits of the district, yet a description of it is deemed necessary to its complete elucidation. Nearly the whole of this area is an unbroken wilderness, interspersed with tangled thickets, almost impassable marshes and inland lakes, which \u2022retard the progress of the explorer; and, even along the mountain ranges where the rocks approach the surface, their presence is often concealed by a thick covering of moss. It is only on the precipitous cliffs, or along the beds of streams, that their true characters are revealed. Even in a densely populated district, every road that is constructed, every shaft that is sunk, and every quarry that is opened, reveals some interesting fact in geology ; and it is by an attentive observance of these artificial excavations, rather than of the accidents of the soil, that the geologist is enabled to draw correct conclusions. In the prosecution of our labors, we have been enabled to avail ourselves of few of these extraneous aids. Passing weeks in suc cession in the midst of the sorest, with no trace of the works of man around us, except the surveyors' lines, we have encountered difficulties unknown and unappreciated by geologists in a more civilized and less inhospitable region. Under these circumstances, it would not be surprising, if, hereafter, when the country becomes more thoroughly opened, and the means of com- munication more direct, it were found necessary to alter, in some respects, the boundaries of the several systems of rocks. Each year will develop new facts and fresh materials for illustration. There is another circumstance to which we deem it proper in this con nection to allude. It was the desire of the department to be placed in possession of the results of these explorations at the earliest period practica ble. We were instructed to press forward the work with all due diligence to completion. We have been in charge of the survey a little more than two years. During the first year, we prepared a report on the \" Geology of the Copper Region,\" in which we endeavored to define the boundaries of the cupriferous belts, and exhibit the principal phenomena of veins. We now transmit the concluding portion of the work, embracing in the main the results of our explorations during the second year. t It will be seen that there are, in this region, two great metalliferous belts, distinct in age and in the character of the products ; to wit, copper and iron. There is already a large interest invested in the copper mines, and their products are to be found in the principal markets of the United States. It is believed that the supply from this source will soon meet the national consumption. The Iron Region will ultimately prove of equal value. From the details incorporated in this report, it will be seen that the specular and magnetic ores are here developed on a scale of magnitude, and in a state of purity, almost unprecedented. While our main object has been to trace out the boundaries and deter mine the quality of these economic materials, we have also endeavored lo"], [265, "INTRODUCTION. V incorporate the scientific results of our explorations, such as the relative ages of the different groups of rocks, the character of the fossils entombed in a portion of them, and the conditions of the ocean in which they were deposited. In the prosecution of this work, we have been aided by Messrs. James Hall, of New York, E. Desor, of Massachusetts; and Charles Whittlesajr, of Ohio, whose contributions will be found incorporated in the pages of this report. In the exploration of a portion of this region, we were also aided by- Mr. S. W. Hill, of Michigan. Mr. John Burt, for many years a surveyor in this region, kindly placed his notes at our disposal.

In Part I. of this Report, communicated to the Commissioner of the Gene ral Land Office in 1850, and published in 1851, we have given a historical sketch of the exploration of the country bordering on Lake Superior, a description of its physical geography and climate, and so much of its geo logy as was necessary to the full elucidation of the copper-bearing rocks and their relation to the sedimentary formations ; this being the subject to which that part of the report was principally devoted. The two concluding chapters contained an account of the drift phenomena so conspicuously displayed in the region of the great lakes. In Part II. of this Report, we shall proceed to the detailed and sys tematic description, so far as our materials will enable us, of the geology of the whole of the Lake Superior Land District, commencing with those formations which are the lowest in the scale of geological succession, or those which were the first formed, and ascending to those which are now in the progress of accumulation. We shall only allude to the results of the former part of the report, so far as it may be necessary to enable the reader to form a connected idea of the geology of the whole region.

The term rock, according to the arrangement of M. Constant Prevost,* is applied to masses, or beds, whether the elements composing them be homogenous, or complex : formation explains their origin, while system designates the relative ages of the different parts. Two sets of causes have operated simultaneously to produce the various compounds which compose the crust of the earth : these are the igneous and the aqueous. The rocks resulting from the first, or igneous set, have a crystalline aspect, and contain certain mineral substances, such as feld spar, mica, hornblende, pyroxene, Sac, constituting great irregular masses, and traversed by divisional planes, pursuing, for the most part, a uniform direction. The rocks resulting from the second, or aqueous set, are arranged in sedi mentary deposits, divided into strata, beds, layers, &c, composed, for the most part, of argillaceous, calcareous and arenaceous particles, and often contain numerous organic remains. \u2022 Article \" Formation\" Dictionnaire Univeisel d' Histoire Naturelle."], [279, "[4] 3 In addition to the two grand classes of formations, igneous and aqueous it is necessary to establish two orders of mixed formations. Where the materials were formed in the interior of the earth, and ejected by the action of fire, but subsequently modified by the action of water, which transported and deposited them in stratified beds, such as trap-tuff, peperino, &.C., often enclosing organic remains ; these are called Pluto-Neptunian On the other hand, those rocks which were deposited by water, and afterwards modified by the action of heat, changing their charactei and causing them to resemble igneous formations, such as the crystalline schists, siccharoidal marbles, &c, these are called metamorphic. Thus far the arrangement of M. Prevost. Each system of detrital rocks in this district, if we except the drift, is characterized by the presence of igneous products, which differ as much, one from another, as the sedimentary systems. Thus, the oldest class of igneous products consists of hornblende and feldspar rocks, and serpentine rocks, and may be regarded as contemporary with the azoic system. Next in order are the granites and syenites, which are intermediate in age between the azoic and Silurian systems. These are traversed by at least two systems of greenstone dykes which are anterior to the purely sedimentary deposits. Contemporaneous with the lower portion of the Silurian system, are the bedded traps and amygdaloids of Keweenaw Point, Isle Royale and the Ontonagon region; and, although composed of nearly the same constituents as many of the older igneous rocks, theie is no difficulty, from the diversity in external characters, in drawing the line of demarcation between them, \u2014 the older being compact or crystalline, but never amygdaloidal. Below all the fossiliferous groups of this region, there is a class of rocks, consisting of various crystalline schists, beds of quartz and , saccharoidal marble, more or less metamorphosed, which we denominate the Azoic sys tem. This term was first applied by Murchison and de Verneuil to designate those crystalline masses which preceded the pal\u00e6ozoic strata. In it, they include not only gneiss, but the granitic and plutonic rocks by which it has been invaded. We adopt the term, but limit its signification to those rocks which were detrital in their origin, and which were supposed to have been formed before the dawn of organized existence. This, however, is a mooted point. Lyell, on the one hand, maintains that animal organisms may yet be detected below what is now regarded as the oldest fossiliferous group ; while, on the other hand, Murchison contends that it is highly probalile ure have reached the point where organized existence first started. We incline to the latter view ; and are disposed to regard these deposits as having been accumulated before the dawn of animal life, rather than that organisms flourished, died and were entombed in the rocks, and that their remains have become obliterated by the long-continued action of heat. The Silurian, or protozoic system, as it is sometimes called, since here we find the first traces of organized existence, is represented in this district from its summit to its base. Much confusion prevails with regard to the nomenclature of the different groups composing it. The various State sur- veys, while they have developed many valuable facts, have, also, originated a multitude of local names. They started about the time that Murchisor. first promulgated his subdivision of the Transition rocks ; and while Ameri can geologists recognized the great leading features of that subdivision, they failed to detect subordinate groups. There existed in this country, no stan dard of comparison, and hence arose a variety of names, local in their ap-"], [280, "4 [4] i plication, and often founded on the lithological, instead of the zoological characters of the rocks. Unfortunately, few of these surveys were carried to completion, so that the geologists in charge were unable to adopt a na tional nomenclature. The New York geologists have divided the Silurian system, as developed in that state, into eleven groups, while some of the Western geologists re cognize, in its western extension, but five. Between the two systems of classification there is no community of names. The geographical position of our district is such as to form a connecting link between the East and the West. While, on the one hand, the New York and Canadian geologists have traced the Silurian groups up to the eastern borders of our district ; on the other hand, the geologists of Michi gan, Iowa, Wisconsin and other states, have traced the same groups, though under different names, along their southern and western prolongation, with out having attempted to identify them with their eastern equivalents, or to subdivide them according to the pal\u00e6ontological evidence. Under these circumstances, we have endeavored to connect the two sets of observations and blend them into one harmonious whole. As the New York survey is the only instance in which the matured results have been communicated to the public, and as the volumes on the pal\u00e6ontology \u2014 a monument of the research and perseverance of the author, Mr. Hall \u2014 will form the standard of reference for the whole country, in determining the succession of the Silurian groups, we have deemed it advisable to adopt that nomenclature, so far as the same groups described by the New York geologists could be recognized in our district. The designation of groups of strata by names derived from their geogra phical position, or from the locality in which the rocks are first investigated and their relative position clearly defined, seems to be of all the methods of nomenclature that which, for the present at least, is liable to the least ob jection. Names given solely with reference to lithological character, or to the presumed predominance at any particular point of a certain genus or class of organic remains, seem much more likely to lead to misunderstand ing and confusion ; and, however desirable it may be that a universal system of nomenclature and arrangement should be introduced, it seems quite im possible to hope for any such thing in the present state of geological science, a science which is so rapidly developing, and liable to such constant changes. The names introduced by the New York geologists, are in most instances derived from the locality where the group designated is particularly well developed, and the fact that those groups have, in their continuation through Canada, been described by Mr. Logan, the Provincial Geologist, under the names recognized by the New York survey, seems an additional reason for their adoption, as far as possible, by us. g It will be seen from the details incorporated in a subsequent part of th;s report, that many members of the Silurian series, particularly the grits and conglomerates, which are clearly defined in New York, have but a limited range, and disappear altogether before reaching the limits of our district. These are conditions which we ought to expect would exist in deposits made along a shelving ocean-shore ; but so far as these are persistent, it seems desirable that they should bear the same names throughout their whole extent."], [281, "[4] 5 The following is the synonomy of the groups of the systems ueve.oped in this region, according to the nomenclatures adopted in the reports of the different surveys.

Accompanying this report, will be found a general Geological Map ot the region over which our observations have extended, on which we have attempted to delineate by a system of colors, so far as practicable, the boundaries of the several groups of rocks embraced in the above table. \u00bb Although we have succeeded in recognizing most of the minor groups, such as the Chazy, Birds-eye, Black-river limestones, and also the Medina sandstone and Clinton groups, not only by their lithological characters, but by their fossil contents, yet their geographical range is so limited that they cannot well be represented on a map of this contracted scale. By adopting a set of symbols, we have endeavored to represent minor phenomena, such as the bearing and inclination of the strata, and in many instances their mineral associations. In preparing the geology of the northern coast of Lake Superior, we have availed ourselves of the labors of Mr. Logan, the distinguished Pro vincial Geologist of Canada. We have had less reluctance in presenting"], [282, "[4] 6 an epitome of his investigations, lot the reason that his reports of progress have had but a limited circulation in the United States, and for the addi tional reason that they tend to elucidate the geology of our own district. EXPLANATION OF THE GENERAL SECTION. The General Section appended to this report has been constructed for the purpose of exhibiting not only the different systems of stratified rocks which prevail in this district, and the relative positions of the granitic and trappean formations ; but is also designed to represent a geognostic pro file of the route traversed, in which the relative heights of the most promi nent points above the level of Lake Superior are given. We have, also, constructed a ground plan on which the topographical features of the region, along the line of the section, are delineated \u2014 a feature not hitherto intro duced into works of this character, but which is calculated to afford the inquirer essential aid. This section commences at the head of Thunder Bay, on the north-west coast of Lake Superior, and terminates at the mouth of the Menomonee river of Green Bay, pursuing a course of about N. 18\u00b0 W. and S. 18\u00b0 E. Its entire length in a direct line is nearly 260 miles. The scale of height has been made to conform as closely as possible to that of length, with a due regard to the representation of all the phenomena. We have not attempted to represent the drift deposits which are plenti fully distributed over nearly the entire region. We propose to give a brief explanation of the phenomena delineated on the section. Commencing a few miles inland from Thunder Bay, we meet with a range of granite, belonging to the oldest system of upheaval, around which the upper beds of the azoic system are deposited in a horizontal position. At Thunder Cape and Pie island, these slates are exposed in a nearly vertical section a thousand feet in thickness, with a crowning overflow of trap of about 300 feet. The greater portion of Isle Royale is composed of trappean rocks of the Silurian epoch, which do not rise in great irregular masses, but present a bedded structure. On the southern slope of the island, we meet with inter calations of sandstone and conglomerate, dipping with considerable uni formity to the south-east. The southern margin of the island, between Siskawit Bay and the point south of Washington Harbor, as well as the various reefs, consists of conglomerate passing into sandstone ; and we have no evidence of the invasion of the trap between this line and the southern coast. Keweenaw Point is the counterpart of Isle Royale, except that the dip of the sedimentary rocks is reversed ; thus, rendering it highly probable that between these two points there is a great curvature in the strata, caused by an elevation along the lines of two volcanic fissures. The alternations of con glomerate and trap are much more numerous on the northern slope of Ke weenaw Point than on Isle Royale, and the latter attain a much greater thickness. The productive veins of copper are restricted to the trap, al though in many instances the fissures traverse the conglomerate. This con glomerate is not, strictly speaking, a sedimentary rock, but in the nature of a tuff or peperino, and is due to the joint action of fire and water. On the southern slope of the axis, the sandstone which is here a purely sedimentary"], [283, "[4] 7 rock, and the equivalent of the Potsdam, is seen clipping away from the crystalline trap at a high angle ; but at a short distance from the line of igneous outburst, it verges towards horizontality ; and all along the coast to near the head of Keweenaw Bay, it presents a series of gentle undulations, A short distance above the Methodist Mission at L'Anse, it is seen reposing unconformably on the slates of the azoic system. From this point to Chippewa island, in the Menomonee river \u2014 a dis tance in a direct line of more than 80 miles \u2014 the country is occupied by rocks of the azoic system, consisting of various crystalline schists, beds of quartz, saccharoidal marble, and immense deposits of specular and magnetic oxide of iron. They are invaded at numerous points by igneous rocks, both granitic and trappean. At Chippewa island, the Potsdam sandstone is seen reposing upon the upturned edges of the slates, or occupying the preexisting depressions in the igneous rocks. To this succeed the calciferous sandstone, and the Trenton limestone. The bed of Green Bay has been excavated in the Hudson-river group, while the Niagara and Onondaga limestones, being more indestruc tible, form a barrier reef on the east, known as the peninsula of Green Bay."], [284, "[4] 8 CHAPTER II.

The Azoic System \u2014 so called from the entire absence of organic remains \u2014 comprises the most ancient of the strata which form the crust of the earth. They consist for the most part of gneiss, hornblende, chlorite, talcose and argillaceous slates, interstratified with beds of quartz, saccha roidal marble and immense deposits of specular and magnetic oxide of iron. Most of these rocks appear to have been of detrital origin, but greatly trans formed by long-continued exposure to heat. They are sub-crystalline or compact in their structure, and rarely present unequivocal signs of stratifi cation. They exhibit the most violent dislocations ; in one place the beds are vertical, in another, reversed, and in another, present a succession of folded axes. Intermingled with them is a class of rocks whose igneous origin can hardly be doubted, and to whose presence the metamorphism so character istic of this series, is in some measure to be ascribed. They consist of va rious proportions of hornblende and feldspar forming traps and basalts, or where magnesia abounds, pass into serpentine rocks. They appear in some instances to have been protruded through the preexisting strata in the form of dykes or elvans ; in others to have flowed in broad lava streams over the ancient surface ; and in others to have risen up through some wide expanding fissure, forming axes of elevation. Most geologists, at this day, admit that the earth was originally in a fluid state and refer to heat as the solvent power; that the earth gradually parted with portions of this heat so as to allow the materials to crystallize and form a crust around the incandescent nucleus ; that the waters acting on this crust detatched particles of matter and carried them far into the ocean, where they were deposited in extensive beds, or strata ; and that by long continued exposure to heat, they assumed the crystalline character which they now present. Their transformation in aggregation, structure and chemical composition, has not resulted from mere contact with plutonic or volcanic masses, but from gaseous sublimations \"which accompany erupted"], [285, "[4] 9 rocks, intense pressure and electro-chemical agencies generated in the vast laboratory of nature. \" If we consider our planet as a cooling mass of matter,\" observes De la Beche \u2014 the great practical and theoretical geologist of England \u2014 \" the present condition of its surface being chiefly due to such a loss of its origi nal heat by long-continued radiation into the surrounding space, that, from having been wholly gaseous, then fluid and gaseous, and subsequently solid, fluid and gaseous, the surface at last became so reduced in temperature, and so little affected by the remaining internal heat, as to have its heat chiefly regulated by the sun, \u2014 there must have been a time fthen solid rock was first formed, and also a time when heated fluids rested upon it. The latter would be conditions highly favorable to the production of crystalline sub stances, and the state of the earth's surface would then be so totally dif ferent from that which now exists, that mineral matter, even abraded from any part of the earth's crust, which may have been solid, would be placed under very different conditions, at these different periods: we could scarcely expect that there would not be a mass of crystalline rocks produced at first, which, however they may vary in minor points, should still preserve a gene ral character and aspect ; the result of the first changes of fluid into solid matter, crystalline and sub-crystalline substances prevailing, intermingled with detached portions of the same substances, abraded by the movements of the first-formed aqueous fluids.\" Chemists have shown that similar materials, when fused, yield dissimilar products, dependent on the rapidity or slowness with which they cooled, and the degree of pressure to which they have been subjected. The re searches of Mitscherlich and Gustav Rose have thrown much light on the process of metamorphism. The artificial mineral products, such as garnet, idocrase, magnetic oxide of iron, &c, and even some of the rarer gems which have been produced in the laboratory of the chemist, or found among the scori\u00e6 of furnaces, afford us an insight as to the manner in which na ture has operated on a grander scale. Since the theory of metamorphism has been generally recognized, many of the rocks which were formerly regarded as igneous, are now referred to aqueous agency, and the transformations which they may have undergone traced to the presence of erupted rocks. Von Buch has shown that the gneiss around the Gulf of Finland has been produced by the metamorphic action of granite. Hoffman points out an instance in the Fichtelgebirge, in which argilla ceous schist, which can be traced for sixteen miles, is transformed into gneiss only at the two extremities, where they come in contact with granite. In the Pyrenees, compact limestone is changed into granular limestone, where it comes in contact with the erupted rocks. The dolomite of the southern Tyrol and of the Italian side of the Alps, is but a metamorphism of calcareous beds, exhibiting no signs of stratification, and no vestiges of organic remains. The marbles of Carrara and Siena, which have afforded so many blocks for sculpture, and which were formerly cited as examples of \" primitive lime-, stone,\" are as recent as the oolite, while the sandstones which flank the Appenines, and were once supposed to rest at the base of the fossiliferous series, are proved to belong to the tertiary. So too, the slates of Claris, which were formerly regarded as transition, have been proved by Agassiz, from the fishes, to belong to a period as recent as the chalk,"], [286, "[4] 10 The vast beds of quartz in South America, which rise in mountains 7000 or 8000 feet in height, are, probably, but transformed beds of sandstone. The ribboned jaspers of Orsk, in the Ural, according to Gustav Rose, are, in all instances, in direct contact with greenstone porphyry, and are but highly silicified schists. Murchison and de Verneuil have observed, in the Ural, the sandstones, limestones and shaleS of the Silurian and carboniferous systems passing into chlorite, talcose, and quartzose rocks, with beds of crystalline marble, as they approach the lines of eruptive agency. It is needless to cite further examples of metamorphism. From the countless analogies which exist, we are authorized in the inference that gneiss is a highly metamorphosed form of shale, quartz of sandstone, and saccharoidal marble of calcareous beds. We shall, therefore, in treating of the various schists, marbles and quartzose rocks, regard them as sedi mentary deposits, transmuted by eruptive agency. We shall recognize no rock as purely igneous, unless it occur in vast, irregular masses, like granite; in dome-shaped, or crater-like summits, like basalt, or trachyte ; in long lines, like dykes, or elvans, cutting through the incumbent strata ; in rami fying veins, like granite ; or broad lava sheets, like trap. Yet, with these restrictions, there are many rocks in this district which almost defy classifi cation. In the earlier periods of the earth's history, igneous causes operated with greater force and intensity, and hence it is, that the ancient sedimentary deposits differ so widely from those belonging to more recent epochs. This system, as its name implies, is characterized by an entire absence of the remains of animal, or vegetable life. It is reasonable to suppose that there was a time in the history of our planet,~when its crust was subject to eonstantly-recurring volcanic paroxysms, when mephitic vapors were es caping through extensive fissures communicating with the interior, and when the waters were in a heated condition, and differed perhaps chemi cally from those of the existing oceans. Under such conditions, we ought not to look for any types of animal, or vegetable life. Many eminent geologists maintain that the lowest stratified rocks are but portions of the Silurian, or Cambrian system ; and that, from long-continued exposure to heat, the lines of stratification have become obscure, and all traces of organic remains obliterated. Our investigations in this district have led us to a different conclusion. If the Potsdam sandstone rests at the base of the pal\u00e6ozoic series, if from that epoch we are to date the dawn of animal creation, there is in this district a class of obscurely stratified rocks interposed between the Silurian system and the granite, \u2014 rocks dis tinct in character, unconformable in dip and destitute of organic remains. They have been so far transformed by direct or transmitted heat as to ex hibit few traces of their original character. Sandstone has been converted into massive quartz, limestone into saccharoidal marble and shales into hard crystalline schists. If we found these rocks graduating into stratified de posits of sandstone, shale and limestone, as we receded from the lines of igneous outburst, and enveloping the remains of animals and plants, we should be led to a different conclusion ; but, so far from it, the evidence is ample that the strata which iorm the base of the Silurian system repose on the upturned edges of the metamorphosed rocks, and that the causes by which their metamorphism was effected had ceased to operate before the deposition of the fossiliferous strata. Between the two systems there is a"], [287, "[4] 11 clear and well-defined line of demarcation. It forms one of those great epochs in the history of the earth, where the geologist can pause and sat isfy himself of the correctness of his conclusions. On the one hand, he sees evidence of intense and long continued igneous action ; on the other, of comparative tranquility and repose. Few regions, perhaps, afford ampler facilities than this, for the investiga tion of the early history of our planet, or at least of that portion extend ing back from the termination of the Silurian epoch to the first-formed or azoic schists, \" when the waters were gathered together unto one pla: \u2022 and the dry land appeared, \" and although a few leaves may be wanting, enough remain to form a connected and intelligible record. * Having thus taken a general view of the origin of the azoic system we will now proceed to describe its geographical distribution. AZOIC SERIES ON THE NORTHERN SHORE. The rocks of which it is composed are developed on an extensive scale, both on the northern and southern margin of the Lake Superior basin. Commencing on the northern shore of the lake, we find a series of talcose and chlorite slates with occasional beds of coarser grits, in immediate con tact with the granite and gneiss. They have been divided by Mr. Logan, the distinguished Provincial Geologist of Canada, into two groups \u2014 a divi sion which we have failed to recognize on the southern shore \u2014 the lowest of which consists of slates partially chlpritic and talcose, and occasionally holding a sufficient number of pebbles derived from the hypogene rocks to constitute conglomerates. \"These slates,\" he remarks, \"are of a dark green color, often dark-grey in fresh fractures, which at the base, appear to be occasionally interstratified with beds of a feldspathic quality, of the red dish color belonging so the subjacent granite and gneiss : sometimes they are a combination of feldspar and quartz, occasionally with the addition of hornblende, making syenitic beds, and in some the hornblende predominat ing gives the syenite a general green tinge. Some of the beds, have the quality of a greenstone, others that of mica slate, and a few present the character of a quartz rock.\"f These slates, he conjectures, attain a {hi \u25a0!. ness of several thousand feet, and are well exposed at the mouth of the river I >p:-&, about five miles from the Michipicoten river. The strike < ! the beds is very irregular and their dip highly inclined. The upper group rests- unconformably on the preceding, and towards the base presents conglomerate beds of no great thickness, the pebbh ; : which consist of white quartz, red jasper and occasionally slate, the whole enclosed in an arenaceous matrix. Higher up are found layers of chert. * Lyell and others, as remarked in a previous chapter, maintain that the rocks composing the azoic system, may once have been fossiliferous,. and that their crystalline character is not due to a peculiar and nascent condition of our planet at the period of their formation. We can hardly conceive it possible that causes of sufficient intensity to elevate continents above the level of the waters, could have operated without having left unmistakable evi dences of their action. At a period when the earth was passing from a chaotic to a habita 1,1 .\u25a0 state, we may suppose that the tivo great antagonistical lbrces of fire and water were Actively excited, and the result would be a vast accumulation of igneous and detrital mate rials; the whole so metamorphosed as to render it difficult in all cases to distinguish between them : and although in the subsequent history of the earth, there is abundant evidence of the repeated and conjoint operations of these causes, yet the azoie, age was emphatically one of JiETAaioKpmsM. t Report of Progress, 1840-7, p. 10."], [288, "[4] 12 occasionally approaching chalcedony. The plates are separated by thin calcareous seams, presenting a ribbon-like appearance. In the vicinity of the disturbed parts, the chert sometimes passes into chalcedony and agate, and small cracks are filled with anthracite, which is also found forming the centre of minute globules, enclosed in a silicious matrix. Higher up in the series, the argillaceous slates become interstratified with argillaceous sandstones, in such an altered condition that it is often difficult, at first sight, to say whether the latter may not be trap layers. Calcareous bands occasionally occur of sufficient purity to be called lime stone. Interlaminated masses of trap are found near the base and over lying the summits. They are composed of a black hornblende anc' greenish-white, horny-looking feldspar, in no instance assuming an amyg daloidal character, but occasionally presenting a porphyritic appearance. It exhibits a sub-columnar structure, and the crowning overflow of trap communicates a peculiar aspect to the whole region occupied by this for mation. It attains a thickness of nearly 2000 feet, and, where it comes to the lake, rises in bold, overhanging cliff's.* \" Beginning at Pigeon Bay \u2014 the boundary between the United Slates and the British Possessions\" \u2014 according to Prof. Mather, who has kindly placed his notes at our disposal \u2014 \" we find the eastern portion of the pen insula lined with bold, rocky cliffs, consisting of trap and red granite. The latter is composed of red feldspar and quartz, with no mica, and is intersected by heavy dykes of trap, and veins of trap and calc-spar, con taining iron pyrites. The whole southern shore of the bay, wherever examined, presents this character. The falls of Pigeon river, eighty or ninety feet in height \u2014 are occa sioned by a trap dyke which cuts through a series of slate rocks highly indurated and very similar in mineralogical characters to the old grey wacke group. Trap dykes and interlaminated masses of trap were observed in the slate near the falls. These slates, brown and grey in color, form beds of stratified rock, nearly horizontal in position, around the granite, exhibiting no marks of derangement or upheaval through which the latter rocks emerge like islands. Both of these rocks are traversed by dykes, belonging to a common system. The base of nearly all the ridges and cliffs between Pigeon river and Fort William is made up of these slates, and the overlying trap. Some of the low islands exhibit only the grey grits and slates. Welcome islands in Thunder Bay display no traps, although, in the distance, they resemble igneous products, the joints being more obvious than the planes of stratifi cation, thus giving a rude semi-columnar aspect to the cliffs.\" At Prince's Bay, and also along the chain of islands which line the coast, including Spar, Victoria and Pie island, the slates with the crowning traps are admirably displayed. At the British and North American Com pany's works, the slates are traversed by a heavy vein of calc-spar and amethystine quartz, yielding grey sulphuret and pyritous copper, and ga lena. From the vein, where it cuts the overlying trap on the main shore, considerable silver has been extracted. At Thunder Cape, the slates form one of the most picturesque headlands * Vide Report before referred to, pp. 13-14."], [289, "[4] 13 on the whole coast of Lake Superior. They are made up of variously colored beds, such as compose the upper group of Mr. Logan, and repose in a nearly horizontal position. These detrital rocks attain a thickness of nearly a thousand feet and are crowned with a sheet of trappean rocks, three hundred feet in thickness. At L'Anse a la Bouteille, the slates reappear, with the granite protruding through them, and occupy the coast for about fifteen miles: numerous dykes of greenstone, bearing east and west, are seen cutting the rocks ver tically. The Slate islands form a part of this group, and derive their name from their geological structure. They are next seen, according to Mr. Logan, for about seven miles on each side of the Old Pic river. Near Otter Head, a gneissoidal rock forms the coast, which presents a remarkably regular set of strata, in which the constituents of syenite are arranged in thin sheets and in a highly crystal line condition. From this point to the Michipicoten river, the slates and granite occupy alternate reaches along the coast, for the distance of fifty miles. \"With the exception of a few square miles of the upper trap of Gargantua, these two rocks appear to hold the coast all the way to the vicinity of Pointe aux Mines, at the extremity of which they separate from the shore, maintaining a nearly straight south-easterly line across the Batchewauaung Bay, leaving the trap of Mamainse between them and the lake. Thence, they reach the northern part of Goulais Bay, and finally attain the promontory of Gros Cap, where they constitute a moderately bold range of hills, running eastwardly towards Lake Huron.\"* This range, according to the same authority,! in its easterly prolonga tion, where it bounds the St. Mary's river on the north, consists of purely silicious masses of quartz rock, the bedding sometimes well-defined, and the surfaces not unfrequently ripple-marked ; of conglomerate bands, con taining pebbles of vitreous quartz and variously-colored jaspers ; and of limestones of a compact texture and colored green, buff and grey, the whole reposing on granite. Interstratified beds of chert and chlorite slate are not wanting. The bedded masses of igneous rock consist, for the most part, of green stone trap, which in some instances attains the thickness of a thousand feet. The limestone in different parts of the range varies in thickness from fifty to one hundred and fifty feet, and, wherever seen, is found in contact with quartz rock, or syenitic conglomerate. On Thessalon lake, great mountain masses of quartz, with subordinate masses of jasper conglome rates, appear to underlie the limestone, and at La Cloche, a band from 3000 to 4000 feet rests upon it. The scale upon which these older rocks ire here developed, seems almost incredible. The associated bands are traversed by several systems of dykes both of greenstone and granite, and, at the points of contact, afford numerous evidences of metamorphism and disturbance. They are also intersected by veins more recent in their origin, which contain several forms of the sul phurets of copper, and afford promise of profitable exploitation. J * Canada Report, 1846-7, p. 25. f Report, 1848-9. J Professor Agassiz, in his w-ork on Lake Superior, has described many of the igneous belts and metamorphic recks which occur on the north shore, and has called attention to the interesting fact that its outlines have been determined in a great measure by these belts. As that work is readily accessible to the American reader, we deem it unnecessary to present the views of the distinguished author in a more extended form."], [290, "[4] 14 This formation does not here invade the American shore. The Potsdam sandstone has been deposited in the sinuosities of the more ancient quartz, or rests unconformably on its upturned edges. The channel of the St. Mary's has been excavated along the line of junction between the azoic and Silurian systems, thus affording a striking coincidence in the political and geological divisions the country. AZOIC SERIES ON THE SOUTHERN SHORE. In the region included between the two great lakes, known as the north ern peninsula of Michigan, this group constitutes the fundamental rock. The materials of which it is composed appear to have been thrown down in a comminuted , state, since we rarely meet with those grits or conglome rates which occur on the north shore. They constitute alternating beds of great thickness, known as gneiss, hornblende chlorite, argillaceous, sili cious and talcose slates, quartz, spccharoidal, and crystalline limestones. They are highly inclined and much contorted, and nowhere exhibit the characters of a purely sedimentary rock, but the evidences of metamor phism are more striking as we approach the lines of igneous outburst. Gneiss generally flanks the granite, succeeded by dark masses of horn blende, with numerous joints, but obscure lines of bedding, which often graduates into hornblende slate or chlorite slate, as we recede from the purely igneous products. The outlines of this class of rocks are extremely irregular, and a refer ence to the general map will give a clearer idea of their range and extent than a mere verbal description. The great mass, it will be seen, occupies nearly half of township 48, between ranges 30 and 36; thence, they stretch uninterruptedly south to the Brule river ; on the east they are bounded by the granite and sandstone, and on the west by the granite. From the main mass there are numerous projecting arms. One starts from township 48, ranges 25 and 26, and trending in a north-easterly direction, intersects the head of Keweenaw bay, and terminates in township 51, range 30. It flanks the Huron mountains on the north and west, and is separated from Lake Superior by a narrow\u00aband irregular belt of sandstone. The length of this arm is nearly eighty miles, with a width of eight or ten miles. Another arm starts near Machi-gummi, or Big Lake, and runs nearly due cast, intersecting the main lake between Presqu'isle and Carp river. Its length is about thirty miles, varying in width from six to fifteen miles. It is included between two granite bosses, the one on the north and the other on the south. This portion is characterized by vast deposits of specular and magnetic oxide of iron in a state of considerable purity. Another arm about eighteen miles in length and ten in breadth extends easterly into townships 42 and 43, range 28 ; while another shoots off in a southerly direction, occupying the valley of the Menomonee as low down as Pike river, in township 35. Their western termination is in Wisconsin. In this district, the area occupied by these rocks exceeds eighty town ships, or more than three thousand square miles. The configuration of the slates and granites may be compared to the contours of a rugged co^st. The main granite masses form numerous projecting headlands^ while the subordinate patches rise up like islands. The slates sweep round the pro montories and form numerous narrow and deeply-indented bays. The topographical features of the region occupied by the slates are stri-"], [291, "[4] 15 icing. It is diversified by bold, rocky cliffs and narrow and intricace valleys, with lakes and water-falls, with luxuriant forests and natural meadows. The culminating points reach nearly twelve hundred feet above Lake Su perior or eighteen hundred feet above the ocean-level. * We commence our description of the local phenomena of this system of rocks where they intersect the lake shore between Riviere du Mortf and Chocolate river. The sketch entitled \" View near Carp river \" forming the frontispiece may serve to convey an idea of the contours of this region better than a written description. The lake here forms a spacious bay with gently-curving shores. A range of quartzose hills rising to the height of six hundred feet terminates abruptly by the coast and forms the back ground of the picture. The extremity of the point consists of sand-dunes rising to the height of fifty or sixty feet, with rounded outlines and highly inclined slopes towards the lake. Along its margin are to be seen the re mains of ancient terraces which indicate its former limits. The middle ground is occupied by a range of trappean rocks interlaminated with the slates. The settlement here represented, has been named Marquette, in honor of the early missionary, and has already become the main outlet of the Iron region. The foreground is composed of another rocky promon tory which projects for some distance into the lake, and serves as a shelter to vessels against a west and north-west wind ; while by the shore, vestiges of the Silurian sandstone are seen reposing upon the upturned edges of the azoic rocks. It would be difficult to select another spot, along the whole coast, where the rocks of so many 'epochs, from the oldest to the most recent, are represented. It contains an epitome of nearly the whole geol ogy of the district. . . . . The quartz zone exhibits two distinct .ridges, where it approaches the lake, hemming in the valley of Carp river with rocky walls, from two to six hundred feet in height. As we trace it westwardly, it presents but a single ridge, and after having passed Teal lake, sinks down and becomes lost. Where exposed by the lake shore, it exhibits lines of bedding and obscure traces of ripple marks. These lines bear east and west, and dip 86\u00b0 to the south, while the Potsdam sandstone abuts against the quartz, in a nearly horizontal position. Some of the quartz beds in this vicinity en close fragments of jasper and slate, showing that they contain vestiges of prior-formed rocks. The southern ridge \u2014 using the notes of Mr. Hill \u2014 pre- sents a number of conical knobs rising from two to three hundred feet above the surrounding country. In section 2, township 47, range 25, a granite boss rises above the quartz, over which the strata are folded like a mantle. In the north-east quarter of this section, a band of slaty lime stone, somewhat silicious, is seen beneath the quartz, bearing north-east and south-west, with an inclination of 44\u00b0 to the south-east. In the northern part of section 3, the quartz is observed, with another band of limestone interstratified, bearing nearly west north-west. The protrusion of the gra nite has displaced the beds and broken their continuity ; one portion shifted to the south, was traced as far as the line between sections 9 and 10, while * For a list of heights determined barometrically, see Appendix, C. t This river is generally called Dead river. It cannot be from the sluggishness of its cur rent, for in the distance of thirty miles, if falls more than a thousand feet, abounding in rapids and cascades. Its true name is the River of Death. There is a local tradition as tc some act of violence here perpetrated, which we cannot now recall, and from which the river derives its name."], [292, "16 [4] another portion, shifted to the north, was traced westward into section 4. The northern beds were found to be associated with a layer of limestone, or compact marble, only a few feet in thickness. The northern ridge attains a higher elevation than the southern, the highest point in section 6, being five liundred and ninety-two feet above the lake. The quartz has been so far metamorphosed as \"to destroy the lines of bedding, but in other portions of the range, for instance, near the Jackson Forge, it assumes the character of a quartzose conglomerate, and exhibits distinct lines of bedding. A franite protrusion occurs along the line between townships 47 and 48, range 5, which has caused a displacement of the strata, many thousands of feet in a linear direction, throwing one portion of the ridge to the south-west, and another portion to the north ; and it is instructive to observe how far the course of the Carp river has been determined by this dislocation. The main branch curves around the southern outlier, while the affluent, known as Alder creek, finds its way between the granite and the quartz. In section 31, township 48, range 25, near the west line, another band of compact limestone was observed, and thence traced westward, by Mr. Hill, through sections 33 and 36, being well exposed in the escarpments of the ridges. It is less silicious than that before described, variously colored, white, ash-grey and flesh-red, and beautifully veined with tints of a deeper hue. It calcines readily into lime, and affords beautiful ornamental mate rials. Along the valley of the Carp, between Jackson Forge and Teal lake, beds of novaculite, or fine-grained silicious slate, are found interstratified with beds of quartz. It has been already quarried at several points, for hones, and there is, even now, a considerable demand for them. The beds are exceedingly fissile, and full of flaws at the surface, so that much of the mass is comparatively worthless ; but it is believed that the blocks taken from a greater depth, and beyond the action of atmospheric agents, will be free from these imperfections. Messrs. Smith & Pratt have established a actory for the purpose of sawing these blocks, at the mouth of a small stream, near the Marquette landing, and are driving a thrifty business. Between the quartz range and Dead river, the underlying rock consists, in the main, of chlorite and talcose slates, intersected by three belts . of igneous rocks, ranging nearly east and west. De la Beche, in reference to the greenstones and schistose rocks oi Boss iney, Cornwall, remarks that, \"there is so intimate a mixture of compact and schistose trappean rocks with the argillaceous slates, that the whole may be regarded as one system, the two kinds of trappean rocks having been probably erupted, one in a state of igneous fusion, and the other in that of an ash, during the time that the mud, now forming slates, was deposited ; the mixture being irregular from the irregular action of the respective causes which produced them ; so that one may have been derived from igneous action, and the other from the ordinary abrasion of preexisting solid rocks, they were geologically contemporaneous.\" This description is applicable to many of the igneous rocks of this region. They form neither long lines of dykes, nor axes of elevation, but broad sheets, bearing the same relation to the slates that the trappean bands of Keweenaw Point do to the conglomerates. Many of the slates appear to be composed of pulverulent greenstone, as though they might originally have been ejected as an ash, and subsequently deposited as a sediment, and pass by imperceptible gradations, from a highly fissile to a highly compact"], [293, "[41 17 state. In some places, for example, at Marquette and Presqu'isle, they assume a spheroidal structure, as though after their deposition they had been so far operated on by heat as to allow a rearrangement of the parti cles. Along the lines of volcanic action, we frequently find, throughout this district, a green pulverulent substance, somewhat resembling chlorite, and containing a large amount of magnesia and lime, which is probably in the nature of an ash. The same ingredients enter largely into the compo sition of many of the trappean rocks, for they possess a soapy feel, and w hen reduced to a powder, effervesce feebly with acids. There are undoubtedly, at this day, beneath the bed of the ocean, nume rous \" salses,\" which, from time to time, pour forth streams of pulverulent materials, but whose operation is concealed from human sight. We know that for weeks in succession, there flowed streams of chocolate-colored mud fiom the crater of Graham's island, before it finally sank below the surface. The contributions from this source, to the first formed stratified deposits, have not been duly appreciated. This volcanic mud is nothing more than the comminuted particles of trappean rocks, reduced by friction ; and in the early history of pur planet, when the fissures communicating with the inte rior were unfilled and volcanic energy was manifested more intensely than at this day, it would be reasonable to expect that igneous causes contributed as powerfully to the reduction of the preexisting rocks, as the ordinary abrading action of water. The slates are composed essentially of the same ingredients as the trappean rocks with which they are associated, and the main difference between them may be, that the one was the product of s Uses, ejected in the form of mud, while the other was the product of vol canoes, ejected in molten streams. It has been supposed that the talcose nature of the slates associated with the igneous rocks was the result of metamorphism, but the supposition that they have resulted in some instances from the destruction of the latter, is quite as reasonable. About a mile from the lake shore, on the road leading to the Jackson Forge, a low range of trappean rocks, of a compact texture, and of a dark- (Fig. 1.) Brecciated hornblende and feldspar rock. freen color, is intersected. Between the Jackson and Marquette landings, _ y the lake shore, a similar belt is observed, which again appears near the junction of the roads, about four miles inland. Another belt intersects the coast a short distance above the Marquette landing, which does not differ essentially from those before described. The"], [294, "[4] 18 slates in the vicinity of these belts are compact, of a greenish color, anu traversed by different systems of joints, more distinct than the lines of bed- ding, cutting the mass into cuboidal blocks. At Little Presqu'isle, another band of igneous rocks, of a highly crystal- line character, projects into the lake. Distinct acicular crystals of horn- blende are distributed in places through a paste of pure-white feldspar, while in others, these two minerals are disconnected, the latter forming beds of considerable thickness. Angular fragments of hornblende slate, chlorite slate; jasper and a green magnesian mineral, are seen enclosed in the mass near the water's edge, as represented in the preceding illustra tion, (Fig. 1,) which may be regarded as a volcanic breccia. These frag- ments seldom exceed a few inches in diamete. . Like most of the rocks of this region, its surface is smoothed and striated in a wonderful manner. Below the mouth of Dead river, a highly crys- talline mass of this character emerges in the form of an island fifty or sixty feet in height. The main Presqu'isle consists of a dark-green trappean rock, rising in overhanging cliffs to the height of a hundred feet. A description of this rock and the relations which it bears to the sandstone will be given when we come to treat of the Silurian system. Over this is deposited a volcanic tuff, imperfectly stratified, filling up the previous depressions, and attaining a thickness of twenty or thirty feet. It presents a complete net-work of veins, a few lines only in width, which penetrate but a short distance into the subjacent basalt. At one place, on the north-west side of the point, an irregular vein bearing north and south is seen for two hundred feet in a linear direction, in this obscurely stratified toff', which yields the sulphurets of lead, copper and iron, but not in sufficient quantities- to render its ex- ploitation profitable. Asbestus is also sparingly distributed, and may be regarded as a metamorphic product resulting from the presence of lime. Traces of magnetic oxide of iron and black oxide of manganese are detected in some of the veins farther eastward. Proceeding up the valley of Dead river, between sections 7 and 16, township 48, range 25, the stream is precipitated from a Jieight of twenty feet over a ledge of schistose rocks, which exhibit distinct lines of bed- ding and abrupt convolutions of the strata. In the next range west (27,) the trappean and\" schistose rocks are frequently exposed in the bed of the stream, consisting o f alternations of talcose and chlorite slates, and hornblende and feldspar rocks. They stretch out in numerous parallel ridges, bearing north of east and south of west, and pre- sent, for the most part, southerly escarpments. On the north-west quarter of section 16, the river is precipitated in a series of rapids over the former class of rocks, affording fine exp.osures for observation. On the west boundary of section 6, in a high led ge which rises from the northern bank of the stream, the slates are again observed dipping to the south at an angle of 70\u00b0. The stream here bears west-north-wes t, conforming to the direction of the strata. After flowing along the northern line of township 48, nearly through range 27, it divides into numerous branches whose sources lie to the north-west, in the region of the graruite. Proceeding southward from Teal lake, we first encounter a ridge of trap pean rocks which skirt its southern shore- and rise abruptly to the height of two hundred feet above the lake-level, si leceeded by chlorite slates and vast"], [295, "[4] 19 masses of specular and magnetic oxide of iron. As we shall devote a special chapter to the character of these masses and their relations to the associated rocks, a more minute description is here deemed unnecessary. We would merely observe that in this region the iron masses are invariably found in this association \u2014 never occurring in the granite. These alternations of trappean and schistose rocks continue, to near tne southern boundary of township 47, and are characterized in many places by the ores above described. SECTION FROM LAKE SUPERIOR TO LAKE MICHIGAN. The coast near the head of Keweenaw Bay (L'Anse) affords an admira ble section of the slates and the overlying sandstone. (Vide Plate XXI., Figure 1.)* The following is the descending order of succession : 1 and 2. Fissile sandstone \u2014 the equivalent of the Potsdam \u2014 dipping slightly to the west-north-west, of a reddish color, and coarse-grained, passing into a conglomerate composed of pebbles of milk-white quartz, and occasionally trappean pebbles \u2014 13 feet, resting unconformably on the azoic rocks, consisting of 3. Chlorite slate and novaculite, or silicious slate, variously colored, and much contorted \u2014 in places folded over 4. A dark hornblende and feldspar rock evidently trappean in its origin. Formations 3, and 4, are traversed by veins _of quartz which in no case penetrate the overlying sandstone. The slates are also occasionally intersected by dykes of trap. (5) This section is exceedingly instructive, inasmuch as it enables us to draw a line of demarcation between two formations different in age and external characters. While the newer formation \u2014 the Potsdam sandstone \u2014 is but slightly if at all disturbed and little changed by metamorphism, the older, or azoic slates, are contorted and folded into numerous arches, and in seve ral places, invaded by igneous rocks. Their structure has been changed from granular to sub-crystalline, and the whole mass is intersected by nu merous planes of lamination. ' These slates are displayed for three miles along the south-eastern coast of Keweenaw Bay, and, within that distance, exhibit several distinct convolu tions, alternately convex and concave. This structure is probably charac teristic of the whole of the azoic series, but it is nowhere so beautifully shown as along this coast, for the reason that it is impossible to meet with equally extended sections inland. Even where, at the surface, the strata are apparently vertical, if we could trace them downward, they would proba bly be found to form parts of flexures more or less abrupt. The upper portions of these flexures are, for the most part, imperfectly traced, for the reason that they, have been removed by denudation. The section displays in a very remarkable degree those planes designated as planes of lamination, represented by the highly inclined lines. (Plate XXI., Figure 1-6.) However great the foldings of the strata, which may * The geology and topography on a southerly line between Lake Superior and Lake Michigan is illustrated on the General Section. It is but justice to add that in the explora tion of this region, as well as in the preparation of the section, we were assisted by Mr. S. W. HilL"], [296, "[4] 20 be traced by the variety of colors, these lines pursue a parallel direction, only an inch or two asunder, sometimes coinciding with those of stratifica tion, and sometimes intersecting them at greater or less angles ; thus showing that the materials composing the mass have undergone a rearrangement since they were first deposited, \u2014 a result probably due to the operation of some great law of crystallization, as yet but imperfectly understood. The lines of lamination dip towards the south, or away from the axis of elevation, and the separation of the blocks is more easily effected in this direction than along those of stratification. Professor Sedgwick was the first geologist to describe these lines, and their uniformity of strike. In the gorge of the Wye, they were observed to cut mountain masses from the summit to the base, preserving throughout a strict geometrical parallelism. He is of the opinion that no retreat of parts, no contraction in dimensions in passing to a solid state can account for the phenomenon, but that it must be referred to crystalline or polar forces, acting simultaneously and somewhat uniformly in given directions, on large masses, having a homogeneous composition.* At the head of the bay, the slates reappear and exhibit the same folded structure. They are somewhat changed in their lithological character, taking into their composition a larger amount of chlorite. For a mile or more, they are exposed along the bed of Fall river, and, in places, are suffi ciently fissile to be employed for roofing purposes. The silicious beds noticed as occurring on section 25, form a very tolera ble material for the coarser kind of hones, or whetstones ; although the substance is somewhat friable, it has a sharp grit. The Indians frequently resort here to obtain pipe-stones, which they work into curious and fantas tic forms. Along the northern flank of the granite, the slates are obscurely traced, their presence being indicated only by occasional fragments strown over the surface, or by low ledges in the beds of rills. As we approach the granite axis, the detrital rocks become more crystalline and exhibit in a more marked degree the effects of metamorphism. About a mile and a half south of the line between townships 50 and 49, range 32, (vide the general section appended to the report,) gneiss was observed flanking a range of well characterized granite. Between this point and the head of Keweenaw Bay, about eight miles distant, the following is the order of succession of the rocks. * The experiments of Mr. Robert Were Fox seem to point to voltaic agency as the cause of these phenomena. He succeeded in producing lines of lamination in clay by long- con tinued voltaic action, the planes of the lamin\u00e6 being formed at right angles to the electric forces. lie considers that the general laminated structure of the clay in these experiments appeared to indicate that a series of voltaic poles were produced throughout the clay, the symmetrical arrangement of which had a corresponding effect on the structure of the clay, and that this view was confirmed by the occurrence in several instances of veins, or rather lamin\u00e6 of oxide of iron or copper, according to the manner in which the experiments were conducted. He considers the prevailing direction of the electrical forces, depending often on local causes, to have determined that of cleavage, and the more or less heteroge neous nature of the rock to have modified the extent of their influence. Report of the Polytechnic Society of Cornwall _ quoted by Da la Seche. Mr. Darwin states that the ore of the gold mines of Yaquil in Chili is ground into an impal pable powder, which is washed and the sediment collected in a pool, which after having subsided is thrown into a heap. Chemical action then ensues,1 various salts effloresce on the surface, the mass hardens and divides into concretionary fragments. These fragments were observed to pos\u00b0ess an even and well-defined slaty structure, but the lamin\u00e6 were not in clined at any uniform angle. \u2014 Travels in South America."], [297, "[4] 21 1. Granite rising in a ridge over a thousand feet in height, and bearing north of east and south of west. 2. Gneiss, with a large amount of mica. 3. Compact hornblende, with silex in places predominating. 4. Chloritic, argillaceous and silicious slates. Passing over the granite which forms a zone ten miles in width, and rises in places to the height of twelve hundred feet, being the culminating point between the two lakes, the azoic rocks reappear. Near the centre of township 48, range 21, on the southern flank, the following was the order of succession observed. 1. Granite, ranging nearly east and west. 2. Quartz and feldspar passing into granular quartz. 3. Compact hornblende, traversed by numerous joints 4. Magnetic and specular oxide of iron, with thin lamin\u00e6 of white, granu- lar quartz. This association of rocks was observed north of a small lake known as Sagiagans, which forms the first link in a chain extending as far east as range 30. It is one of the sources of the Menomonee and lies one thousand and forty-nine feet above its embouchure. On the north, the granite rises in precipitous ridges, with rounded summits, while to the south, the coun try occupied by the slates stretches out in low, marshy plains. On a rocky island near the northern border of this lake, there occurs a hornblende and silicious slate with thin lamin\u00e6 of magnetic oxide of iron. Passing through a tortuous channel, bordered on either side by marshes, we emerge into a a second lake of about the same dimensions. Granite is observed on the north in conical hills, three and four hundred feet above its surface. Be tween the second and third lake, there occurs a portage (No. 1,) where the stream descends twent}--four feet in the distance of three-fourths of a mile. Aside from the descent, the channel is obstructed by numerous boulders of hornblende and granite. In section 21, township 48, range 31, loose masses of hornblende were observed containing a large amount of magnetic iron. The compass here exhibited great perturbation, and in one instance the poles were reversed. In passing over this portage, numerous blocks of compact and slaty iron ore were seen strown over the surface, but no where in place. Portage No. 2, is a short distance east of the entrance to Machi-gummi, or Big Lake, and the trail winds around the base of an elevated knob for three-fourths of a mile. Machi-gummi is among the most beautiful of the inland lakes of this region. It is in the form of a crescent, and elevated 1014 feet above Lake Superior. The numerous islands which dot its surface consist of dark green, compact hornblende, jointed, and perhaps bedded. A range of similar rocks borders its northern margin, cropping out in mural cliffs, two and three hundred feet high, crowned with stunted cedars and spruces. The southern shore is lined with similar rocks, intermingled with patches of dark-green slates, corrugated on their surfaces, and displaying distinct lines of bedding, which dip nearly vertically. All along this chain of lakes, the aberrations of the needle are great, and indications of iron abundant. To William A. Burt, Esq., is due the credit"], [298, "[4] 22 of having first determined the existence of these beds and proclaimed their value.* On the north side of Machi-gummi, in numerous places, an impure variety of magnetic iron is seen \"associated with hornblende or quartz, pre- senting a banded structure. On the southern shore, Mr. Burt observed a bed along the south boundary of township 48, range 30, section 34, having a granular structure, a dark brown color, and bearing south-west ; but it was exposed to no great extent. Another bed associated with a rock in which quartz largely predominates, was observed on the south side of section 35, forming a knob twenty feet in height. It was laminated and jointed, the lamin\u00e6 bearing W. S. W., and dipping 80\u00b0 E. S. E. In range 29, on the south side of section 32, a ledge of iron ore eight feet in height crops out for the distance of nearly seventy-five chains ; course W. N. W. Mr. Burt describes it as variable in richness, structure granular, lustre in fresh fractures metallic, highly magnetic and sometimes possessing polarity. Another bed is described by him as occurring in range 28, on the south line of section 33, in the form of a knob fifty feet in height, jointed and banded, resembling a brown hematite with a large admixture of quartz. At the outlet of the lake, the stream, increased by numerous affluents, expands to the width of sixty feet, with an average depth of two and a half feet, and takes the name of Machi-gamig, \u2014 or, The river flowing from a large lake. It winds its way through superficial deposits which conceal all traces of the subjacent rocks, until it reaches township 46, range 29 and 30, where it forms a lake-like expansion. A chain of hills two hundred feet above its surface, approaches from the left to near the water's edge. On exploring this range, we found that it consisted of a mass of specular oxide of iron, portions of which were of sufficient purity to be profitably wrought. For the distance of eighty sect from the water, the rock is concealed by soil supporting a dense growth of trees ; it then shoots up in a perpendicular cliff to the height of one hundred and thirteen feet. We passed along the base of this cliff for a quarter of a mile seeking for some gap through which we might ascend to the summit, until at length, after much toil and by clambering from one projecting point to another, we succeeded.- Passing back from the brow of the cliff for fifty feet, the mass was found to consist of micaceous and granular oxide of iron: to this succeded aband of white, granular quartz, with particles of iron, disseminated, and, also, large rounded masses of the same material in the nature of a conglomerate, or perhaps, a breccia, fifteen feet in thick ness, succeeded by specular iron exposed in place s to the width of one hundred feet, to where the soil and trees concealed <dl further traces. This iron for the most part, contains thin lamin\u00e6 of quartz arranged in parallel plates, bearing, so near as we could judge, \u2014 for tl e day was dark and rainy and a compass was of no avail, \u2014 north of west and inclining 82\u00b0 north-east, \u2014 corresponding with the strike and dip of the quartz rock. Other portions present a granular structure and are highly magnetic. Veins of quartz, with iron glance, cut through the mass, presenting external characters altogether different from those of the containing rock. This ridge crosses section 1, township 46, range 30, and rises eleven hundred and nine feet * Vide his report on Township Lines, for 1846, Land Office Documents for 1819-50."], [299, "23 [4] above Lake Superior. Here, in this cliff, is sufficient iron, though not as rich as that of the Carp river region, to supply the world for centuries. Above portage No. 4, in sections 1 and,6, according to Mr. Burt, on the right bank of the river, a similar ore appears in a ledge from twenty to fifty feet in height, dipping 80\u00b0 to the south-south-east, of an iron-black color, passing into steel-gray, often resembling very fine cast iron. Another bed of similar character, was observed by him on the east boundary of township 47, range 29, twelve chains in length, rising in a cliff to the heighth of fifty feet. After leaving this portage there is an interval of several miles along which no rock is exposed. The talcose slates probably here prevail, which are more easily denuded than the closely-grained and firmly- cemented hornblende rocks, but on approaching section 31, township 46, range 29, the latter reappear in dark-green masses. Their external characters indi cate the proximity to a line of igneous outburst, and on the adjoining sec tion south (section 5, township 46 range 21,) the granite appears in low, rounded outcrops, and occupies a belt five miles in width, flanked on the south by hornblende, presenting the same lithological characters as that on the north. A short distance below the mouth of Fence river, (township 44, range 27 and 28), the left bank of the Machi-gamig is lined with ledges of com pact and crystalline limestone, rising in places to the height of thirty feet. The lines of bedding bear north-east and south-west, and incline 36\u00b0 to the south-east. Its prevailing tint is flesh-red, inclining to bluish or ash-grey, intermingled with irregular veins of a deeper hue. It is well adapted to ornamental purposes, and for richness of effect is not surpassed by the highly prized foreign marbles. Irregular bunches of quartz are scattered through portions of the mass ; but, with suitable care in the selection, slabs of con siderable dimensions may be obtained. Three-fourths of a mile below, it is again exposed in the left bank of the stream, bearing north 483 east, and dipping nearly vertically, flanked on the south by a bed of argillaceous slate. This slate again appears about a mile below the mouth of Night watching river, so highly indurated that the lines of bedding are very indistinct, while those of lamination are very conspicuous. At portage No. 7, the slates rise in cliffs one hundred and fifty or two hundred feet above the stream, presenting precipitous escarpments to the south. On the north boundary of this township (43) Mr. John Burt observed a bed of specular iron of considerable thickness and purity, but we failed to detect its presence in the river banks. Below portage No. 7, the rocks consist of alternate bands of argillaceous and hornblende slates. At portage No. 8, the latter rOcks are admirably exposed in a nearly vertical position, bearing'north 80\u00b0 east. They are fis sile, of a dark-brown color and contain acicular crystals of amphibole. At portage No. 9, (near the south boundary of township 42, range 31), the granite pierces through the incumbent strata, forming an axis of eleva tion in an east and west direction. On either side, corresponding alterna tions of hornblende and mica slate are observed, and altogether this section affords one of the most beautiful examples of flexures in the strata to be found in the district. At portage No. 10, a mile and a half below, mica slate is exposed dip ping south 60% and is again succeeded by hornblende slate which continues to the junction of the Machi-gamig and Bride rivers, where the united"], [300, "[4] 24 streams take tjie name of the Menomonee, (Indian, Wild-rice river.) The water of the former river is here precipitated from a height of twenty-four feet over a ledge of this rock which rises in sharp ridges on the adjacent banks. The direction of the lamin\u00e6, at this point, is north 72\u00b0 west, dip 69\u00b0 south-east. As we descend the Menomonee, the hornblende and mica slates are found to graduate into chlorite and argillaceous slates. At portage No. 1, alter nations of these rocks are observed \u2014 course north of west with a southerly inclination. At portage No. 2, the chlorite slate forms an abrupt ridge ; the mass contains numerous vesicles filled with calc-spar \u2014 one of the few instances observed where the slates assume a porphyritic appearance \u2014 course north 75\u00b0 east, \u2014 dip 75\u00b0 southerly. The Twin falls break through two parallel ridges of these slates. Here, they are of a dark-green color, in some places fissile, and much plicated, but in others compact. Associated with them are seams of quartz ranging and dipping with the enclosing rocks. They often contain scapolite, and the sulphuret of iron and copDer. The metallic contents, however, of these seams were regarded as worthless. Aside from their conformable inclination and bearing, there can be no doubt that they are contemporaneous with the slates and in the nature of beds, not veins ; for, among the loose fragments in this vicinity we procured specimens of quartz whose surfaces were beautifully ripple marked, while on cross-fracture they presented a compact or sub-crystalline structure throughout. These water-lines are so beautiful and regular that we have thought proper to append a sketch of them, (Plate XXI., Figure 2.) They clearly prove the mechanical origin of the rock, and do they not, also, throw much light on the origin of the associated schists ? The compact texture may be regarded as the result of metamorphism ; and while this agency has thus modified its internal structure, it has failed to deface the mould, or flask, in which it was encased. At the Upper falls the strike of the rocks is nearly at right angles to the course of the stream ; but at the Lower falls the contortions are so great as to bring the strike parallel to its direction. The whole of this region bears upon its surface the marks of powerful abrasion, resulting from the drift agency. The rocks are worn bare, rounded, polished and scratched. Sand, gravel, clay, angular fragments of rock and boulders, are mingled together confusedly, and piled up in ridges a hundred and fifty feet in height. At this point the stri\u00e6 on the rocks bore north 65\u00b0 east. Between the Twin falls and the mouth of Muskos river, the compact hornblende prevails ; but, at the rapids above the latter point, the fissile slates appear with occasional plications. A short distance below, are seen, along the banks of the Menomonee and in its bed, angular blocks of ash grey limestone, some of which contain 2000 or 3000 cubic feet, and con tinue for the distance of half a mile. From their magnitude and angularity, and from their limited distribution, we inferred that the parent mass must exist in this vicinity ; but the hills, which here rise to the height of two hundred feet, are covered with drift, and their summits are strown with boulders arranged in lines, among which Mr. Desor recognised blocks of limestone similar to those in the bed of the river. Within township 39, range 30, occur two of the most beautiful cascades of the Menomonee, the Great and Little Bekuenesec. (For a sketch of the former, see Part I. of our Report.) Above the Upper falls, the rocks con-"], [301, "[4] 25 sist of black, compact masses of serpentine, exhibiting few signs of bedding, but traversed by several systems of joints. They take into their composi tion a large amount of magnesia, and appear under different forms, such as hornblende, steatite, serpentine, &c. At the head of Great Bekuenesec falls, is seen a rock which bears marked evidences of igneous protrusion. It does not appear to have cut the strata, like basalt or greenstone, in long dykes ; or to have flowed over the surface, like the bedded trap ; but, rather, like granite, to have been elevated in a pasty condition through a widely-extending fissure. Like the granite, too, it presents a highly crystalline aspect, and is cleft by nu merous divisional lines into cuboidal blocks. Mineralogically, it might be classed as protogine, being composed of feldspar, quartz and talc, arranged in minute crystalline plates ; but geologically, perhaps this classification might not be recognized, since the protogine of the Alps belongs to a much more recent epoch. Occasionally, hornblende replaces the talc, when it passes into well-characterized syenite. Near the foot of the falls, a bed of drab-colored, talcose slate, in a nearly vertical position, is seen ranging north 70\u00b0 west : to this succeed dark masses of hornblende, or, perhaps, the term serpentine would be more appropriate. Its texture is compact, and in other respects different from the crystalline mass before described. These serpentine rocks reappear at the head of Little Bekuenesec falls, while at the foot, the drab-colored and silicious slates are exposed, bearing east and west with a southerly dip of 80\u00b0. Beds of quartz, containing brown spar and chlorite and magnetic oxide of iron, in octohedral crystals, and copper and iron pyrites, are here observed, but they offer no induce ments for mining enterprise. Between this point and Sandy portage, the dark-colored slates appear on the left, in vertical cliffs, rising in places to the height of two hundred feet, and where they assume a compact structure, resemble basalts. The trail across the portage winds around hills of drift-sand one hundred and fifty feet in height, but along the river-banks the slates are occasionally exposed in a nearly vertical position. The serpentine rocks largely predominate between Sandy portage and Sturgeon falls, often appearing in masses having rounded outlines, and tra versed only by divisional planes ; but, at other times, \u2014 for example, near the head of the falls, \u2014 they display a bedded structure and pass into steatite. In passing this portage, a ridge is intersected bearing north of east and south of west, having very much the external characters of granite, but mineralogically, it approaches protogine. It is traversed by different sys tems of joints, which cleave the mass into cuboidal blocks ; here are also irregular fissures filled with magnesian carbonate of lime and serpentine, with traces of carbonate of copper, but they have not the regularity or the productiveness of true veins. Near the foot of the falls, is seen an entangled mass of slates, cuneiform and about twenty feet in thickness. Similar patches of slate are seen intercalated among the dark-green igne ous rocks, as we descend the stream. The gradations between the crystal line, massive, porphyritic and fissile varieties of rocks are infinite, and seem to set at defiance all attempts at classification. At Quiver falls, the rocks in the main are finely granular, but occasion ally, crystals of red feldspar are seen disseminated through a light-green"], [302, "[4] 26 base. At the head of the first island below, a highly crystalline green- stone is seen, and to this succeed the compact varieties. At Pemenee falls, the rocks assume a basaltic structure, being dark- green, close-grained, and possessing a high specific, gravity. They are tra- versed by numerous lines of division, dividing the mass into cubic blocks. Veins of quartz are observed near the foot of the falls, three or four inches in thickness, associated with brown oxide of iron, bearing nearly east and west, and clipping 28\u00b0 to the north. ! This rock, occasionally porphyritic, prevails as far down as Chippewa island, where it comes in contact with talcose slates, of a light red and grey color, beautifully variegated, bearing north 85\u00b0 west, and inclining but a few degrees from a perpendicular. Between the two, there is a pretty distinct line of demarcation. At the immediate point of contact, the lines of bedding are destroyed, but a foot or two removed, they become conspicuous. There is much sulphuret of iron, in the form of cubic crys- tals, disseminated through the serpentine rocks. Near the foot of Chip pewa island, the slates become porphyritic, containing large crystals of red feldspar, and the dark serpentine rocks are seen in proximity. Numerous alternations of these compact and fissile rocks are observed in this vicinity, the former occasionally changing to a crystalline structure. Near here, on the left bank of the river, the Potsdam sandstone is seen reposing in a horizontal position upon the upturned edges of the slates and filling the preexisting depressions in the serpentine rocks. A detailed de scription of this point will be given when we come to treat of the Silurian system. A few miles further down, the following section (Fig. 2,) was ob served by Messrs. Whittlesey and Desor. Fig. 2. Junction of the Azoic and Silurian Series 1. Drift. 2. Sandstone, horizontal. 3. A mass of brittle, red oxide of iron, or red chalk. 4. Serpentine rock. The drift here forms a bank sixty feet in height, and although the sand stone is not seen in immediate contact with the other rocks, there can be no doubt of the order of superposition. The layers are nearly horizontal, and consist of coarse-grained silicious particles, of a yellow color, and slightly coherent. At the water's edge, a reddish slaty rock, impregnated with the peroxide of iron, is observed, the lamin\u00e6 inclining slightly from a perpendicular, while a little farther removed, a mass of serpentine rock is displayed in the same position."], [303, "[4] 27 Below this point, the compact serpentine rocks largely predominate over the schistose, and are seen at short intervals in the bed of the stream, as far down as the mouth of Pike river. Binds of quartz are, also, found in tercalated. The underlying rock at the White Rapids, according to Mr. Desor, is of this character, with the Potsdam sandstone reposing unconfor mably upon it, and filling up a preexisting depression in its surface. _ Tlie beds of sandstone above described may be regarded as outliers of the great zone which encircles all of the granite and azoic rocks of this region. On the geological map we have extended it as high up as Chip pewa island, where it was first observed. Here, probably, were its ancient limits, and the underlying rocks were laid bare during the drift epoch, when the whole of this region was powerfully abraded. From the White Rapids to the mouth of the Menomonee, about thirty miles distant in a linear direction, the country is successively occupied by the lower groups of the Silurian system ; first, by the Potsdam sandstone, extending to near the Grand Rapids ; next, by the calciferous sandstone, reaching within sixteen miles of Green Bay ; and next, by the Trenfeon limestone, occupying the intervening- space. They repose conformably upon one another ;iii-l incline at a very slight angle to the south-cast. A description of these rocks forms no part of the subject matter of this chapter. The topographical features of the region, along the line of the section just described, are somewhat striking. The explorer, leaving the waters of Lake Superior, passes over a succession of parallel ridges, with rounded outlines, rising higher and higher, until he attains the summit level \u2014 1200 feet \u2014 within about twelve miles of Keweenaw bay, when he strikes the sources of the Menomonee. Following along a londitudinal valley occu pied by a series of beautiful lakes and meadows, he comes to where the waters are accumulated in one great reservoir, 1014.feet above the level of Green Bay \u2014 whose outlet is through a transverse fissure in the hills. With a frail canoe and a couple of attendants, he commences the descent of the Machi-gamig. Day after day, he glides along the wooded banks, with out encountering a trace of man ; running, with race-horse speed, the nu merous rapids ; or, where too formidable, he lands and makes the portage. At night, he draws up his canoe, and camps beneath the shelter of a clump of pines. Occasionally, he observes traces of the otter and beaver, and the tracks of the bear, the wolf, or the deer, impressed upon the sands by the river margin. The valley of the Menomonee has an uninviting aspect. The fires of the Indian have repeatedly swept through the wooels, destroying the prime val growth, and the charred and branchless trunks rise up above the birch and aspen which have subsequently taken root. Abrupt ridges, attainino no great elevation, traverse the country in an easterly and westerly direc tion, and serve to relieve the dreary monotony of the scene. The river itself abounds in rapids, cascades and water-falls ; and these are so numerous and formidable that it can never be navigated, except by canoes. It drains an area of not less than 1200 square miles which offers few inducements to the agriculturalist."], [304, "[4] 28 To illustrate still farther the relations of the different formations, we append the following : The subjoined information is quoted from the MS. of Mr. Whittlesey. \" On the elevation about a mile north of the line between townships 41 and 42, are seen very large blocks of saccbaroi- dal limestone, quartz, granite, greenstone, and specular oxide of iron. One com- posed of quartz and feldspar was 8 by 10 by 12 feet.\u2014 One of variegated marble, green and white, was 4 by 12 by 8. I saw but two exposures of the latter rock, one on section 35, the other on section 36, due east. The beds were nearly co- vered with debris and scarcely observable at the distance of a rod. The iron rep- resented by the large blocks cannot be far distant, although I saw none in place, nor did the surveyor, Mr. Burl, in run- ning the township lines. The needle is mot as much affected here as is usual in the vicinity of iron, in fact, the pieces which I broke from the blocks did not sensibly disturb it. The variations given by Mr. John Burt, in 1849, were as fol- lows : At the S. W. corner of section 3<1, 0\u00b0 5' E. ; one half of a mile N. along the W. side of 34, 6\u00b0 E. : which is near the average variation of the place with- out disturbance. At the middle of the west line of section 35, or one mile east of the last station, it was 15\u00b0 15' E., and one mile farther E. 9\u00b0 30' W. On the S. E. quarter of section 36, it was 3\u00b0 5' E. and a few rods N., 18\u00b0 30' E. ; but both of the above extreme variations were ta- ken nearlarge b^cks of iron. Most of the iron is of a dull -black color, massive and tough, containing silex in the form of chert, approaching horn- stone; but much of it is quite pure yield- ing from fifty to seventy-five per cent, of ore. The limestone is sometimes of a yel- lowish tinge, resembling the calciferous Fig.\" S. sandstone, or lower magnesian limestone ; but at other times, it is pure white and green, beautifully mingled, and is adapted to ornamental pur poses. The space between this iron and marble ridge and the next elevation"], [305, "\u00a34] 29 south is covered with a swamp which is drained by the waters of Cedar river, near its source. It is doubtless underlaid by a confused mass of hornblende, quartz and granite. These rocks are exposed for several miles to the south : in fact, I saw them about a half mile to the east of the swamp. The alternations of these rocks represented in the section for three miles present features strongly contrasting with the surrounding coun try. They are for the most part, denuded, and show sharp, steep faces from twenty to eighty feet in height, bearing east and west, the escarp ments being on the south side. Red and smoky quartz are abundant. There are, also, quartz veins and masses of quartz within the hornblende and granite. The northern portion of these crags is generally hornblende, fibrous or compact : the granite contains silvery mica and occasionally passes into syenite. From these rugged rocks, we passed to a region of pines, growing upon rolling land, composed of sand and drift, which conceal the rocks for three miles, consisting probably of talcose slates, as seen a few miles west. These slates have been more powerfully abraded than the other rocks, from their fissile structure and their yielding nature. On the Correction line between townships 40 and 41, is a mass of vesic ular quartz which presents a remarkable appearance, resembling the fibres of fossil wood. The dip is N. W. by W. at a high angle. It is of a red, or yellow color, and at first was mistaken for sandstone. \" On the north side of the stream, \" quoting from the notes of Mr. Desor, \" it forms a ledj,e twenty-five feet in height ; but on the opposite side, bluffs of pure white quartz rise from one hundred to two hundred feet in height. It is appa rently bedded and cut through by joints, extending from the summit to the base. At one place near the line, it may be seen passing into a hornblende slate, and still farther north, into gneissoid rock. Proceeding east, we found the rock assuming a gneissoid appearance, sometimes in layers and sometimes compact. As a general result, it seems to me that the quartz rock and hornblende are but a variation of the same thing. At the second section corner the rocks rise high, smooth and rounded to the north, but precipitous to the south. One fourth of a mile farther east, is a ridge of black hornblende with intercalated seams of quartz. \" About three-fourths of a mile further south, on the line of the profile, the quartz is again observed in thick beds dipping west at an angle of 25\u00b0, portions of which possess a remarkable fibrous structure. Ascending from the Sturgeon river to the south, the slope is covered to ;m unknown depth with large water-worn boulders of igneous rocks, and some few of metamorphic origin, with very little earth intermingled. We had before observed this phenomenon, but never in so marked a degree. This collection covered the northern face of two successive ranges. The s-ubjacent rock is doubtless the slaty talc seen near some small lakes, two miles west. On the north side of Lac Fumee, or Smoke lake,* in section 23, town ship 40, range 30, there is a sharp and elevated ridge rising apparently to * For the want of a better name, I call this sheet of water Smoke lake. It was a dark lad rainy day when we made our examinations. Following the section line to its northern snore, we were obliged to build a large fire on a terrace about one hundred feet above its siirfece, in order that, after we had made the tour of the west end, we might know by setting tf'e compass when we were opposite the line. The Canadian voyageurs as they looked back and saw the ascending column of smoke, exclaimod \" Lac Fumee '. Lac Fumee .'\""], [306, "[4] 30 the height of three hundred and fifty feet above the lake, which I estimate at two \u00b0hundred feet above the Little Bekuenesec falls. This ridge is an outlier of the lower portion of the Silurian rocks ; the Potsdam sandstone and calciferous sandstone are found resting undisturbed upon the azoic rocks below. The junction is not seen, but there can be no doubt that this is their relative position. Farther to the south-east, I saw the sandstone in two places in the same position, the talcose slates existing not far dis tant. The slopes of the hills on both sides of the lake are composed of heavy masses of coarse drift effectually concealing the rocks. The summit on the south is more elevated than the base of the Potsdam sandstone, but j shows no trace of that rock. In its lithological characters, it may be de scribed as a soft rock, composed of grains of silex, of a reddish-brown color, with a few black and red jaspery pebbles interspersed. Notwith standing its softness, arising from the \\yant of adhesion between the parti cles, it resists the weather perfectly well. The exposure is slight, but distinct, and extends along the northern slope of the ridge for a quarter of mile. The calciferous sandstone, which reposes conformably upon it, is here about one hundred feet in thickness, and comes to the surface at the sum mit. This does not represent the entire thickness, the top having been denuded. It is impossible to determine the thickness of the Potsdam sand stone here, but, about two miles to the south, I saw at least one hundred and fifty feet of it exposed. The calciferous corresponds perfectly, in ex ternal characters, with that of the Wolf and Oconto rivers, in Dr. Owen's district. No traces of organic remains were observed. On sections 34 and 35, the compact marble belonging to the azoic sys tem appears in ledges from ten to sixty feet in height, dipping N. E. by E 70\u00b0, but there is little uniformity in its strike or inclination, and but slight traces of bedding. Its prevailing color is a pale blue, like that at Muskos river, beautifully marked with white, green and red stripes. It can be quarried in large and solid blocks, is susceptible of a high polish, and would afford a highly ornamental material for many architectural purposes. Here the fluctuations of the needle are so great as to indicate the prox imity of a large mass of magnetic iron, although none was observed within three or four miles to the west. At a point one mile west, the variation is given by Mr. Mullet, the linear surveyor, at 90\u00b0 30' E. ; one half mile farther west, at 35\u00b0 50' E., and thence, being frequently taken for the next half mile, gives 164\u00b0 E., 48\u00b0 30' W., 22\u00b0 45' W., 47\u00b0 30' W., 17\u00b0 25' W., and 10\u00b0 30' W. ; turning north one half a mile, it was 0\u00b0 45' E. On section 30, about four miles north-west by west, from where the pro file cuts the line between townships 39 and 40, is a conspicuous iron moun tain, which extends towards the seat of these Arariations. There is, also, near the north-west side of Lac Fumee, on the huge drift hills, which cover the rocks to the depth of one or two hundred feet, a great local disturb ance. The state of the country is such as to render geological explorations difficult, being covered with bushes and burnt logs. There are, on the upper Menominee, large tracts of -land originally covered with pine, which have been prostrated by hurricanes and after wards burnt. These districts are called \"brules.\" The second growth consists of white birch, aspen, pine and hazel. The fires of the Indians frequently sweep through the new growth, destroying it, and giving room for another growth. The explorer, therefore, commands a view of little"], [307, "[4 j 31 i more ground than that on which he stands, and may pass very near a low exposure of rock and not see it. The \"Iron ridge\" to the south-west of Antoine's lake, is the only ex posure of ore I saw in place, and this, for the most part, is covered with J rift. It probably extends along the range south of Lake Antoine and Lac to near the meridian of the profile, between sections 34 and 35. 'she variation at the iron ridge is 17\u00b0 E., and proceeding one mile east, it is successively 0\u00b0 00', 18\u00b0 W., 22\u00b0 W. and 15\u00b0 30' W. I do not consider liuctuations in the needle as an infallible sign of the proximity of iron, but a very good sign. There are other rocks which affect the needle, and there are beds of iron which do not affect it.* Between this exposure of limestone and the Menomonee river is an ex tensive plain of sand-drift covered with dwarf pines. On the east and next to the river, this heavy deposit of loose materials assumes the form of hills, and water-worn gullies, and rests upon the talcose rocks which appear in ' he river banks, especially at the Twin falls, the Great and Little Bekuene <ec falls and at the Sandy rapids. There are patches where the rock is more ferruginous and compact, like greenstone, but the mass is either .s.'aty or compact talc. The mass of specular and magnetic oxide of iron in the south part of Ujwnship 40, range 30, is believed to be the most southerly of all the beds oc this region. It is exposed at the west end of a hill about one hundred feet high, rising to the east one hundred and fifty feet, and occupying a width of from one hundred to two hundred feet. Nothing but slaty ore is seen for the distance of forty rods on the summit. At the sides, as we elescend, the drift and boulders have been piled up around the mass. It is a specular ore, of a bluish-black color, fine-grained, and gives a red streak. On the south and east, there is an abundance of wood for charcoal, and ehe water-power of the stream near the ore is unlimited. The Menomonee is not fitted for navigation, and hence the outlet for these ores should be through Bay des Noquets, forty-two miles distant. \" Thickness of this System. Foldings of the Strata. \u2014 All attempts to estimate the thickness of the various schistose, calcareous and quartzose beds, must prove merely approximative. They occupy a belt which in its widest expansion reaches not less than eighty miles in width, and wherever .'\u25a0cposed, have an inclination approaching vertically. If we were to deduct *ne spaces occupied by the purely igneous rocks, and then measure across it>e basset edges of those supposed to be sedimentary, the result would f.\\ve us an incredible thickness \u2014 a thickness far surpassing that of the whole series of rocks heretofore observed, from the base of the Silurian to the crowning member of the tertiary. It is highly probable that the beds are arranged in a series of flexures resembling those represented in Plate XXI., Figure 1, but with broader and deeper curvatures, and that the observer, in passing over the outcropping edges, beholds numerous repetitions of the same beds ; they have, however, been so repeatedly shattered by earth quakes, so disturbed and forced asunder by igneous protrusions, and so metamorphosed by direct and transmitted heat, that it is impossible to * Mr. -William A. Burt states, that in passing from the Machi-gamig falls to Fort river, in 1846, he intersected a low ridge of iron, not far from the corner of township 41 and 42, be tween ranges 29 and 30. The mass was very pure, banded and jointed, of a granular or micaceous structure, and having a metallic lustre. This was not subsequently met with in running the township lines."], [308, "[4] 32 place their continuity except over limited areas. If we could unfold these beds, and stretch them out in a nearly horizontal position, as when first deposited, they would require a far greater space than they now occupy. The causes by which these foldings have been effected, will be discussed in a subsequent chapter. v \u2022 \u2022 We have thus described the range, extent, and mineral peculiarities of a series of rocks, detrital in their origin, interposed between the granite and the base of the Silurian system. Throughout their whole extent, they aie more or less metamorphosed, presenting a series of gradations, represented at one extreme by crystalline gneiss and compact hornblende, and at tho other by bedded limestone and ripple-marked quartz. To the presence of granitic and trappean rocks this transformation is, in a great degree, to be attributed. Much of the compact hornblende presents the external cha racters of an igneous product ; bus, since it is found to occupy an almost invariable relation to the granite axes \u2014 flanking their slopes \u2014 and to as sume a fissile structure as it recedes from the lines of igneous outburst, we cannot but regard it as tip*1 more highly metamorphosed portions of the dark-green chlorite slates. This compact hornblende is not to be con founded with those lenticular-shaped masses observed in the slates, which, we doubt not, are trappean in their nature. We have seen that those igneous causes which produced numerous axes of elevation, and folded the strata into a series of flexures, had ceased to operate before the deposition of the Silurian groups, since they are found to repose in a nearly horizontal position upon the upturned edges of the slates, or to occupy the sinuosities in the granite, nowhere exhibiting traces of metamorphism or derangement of the strata. We do not now allude to the renewal of those igneous causes as manifested on Keweenaw Point and Isle Royale during the Silurian epoch, producing a class of igneous pro ducts widely different from those associated with the rocks of the azoic system. In a former report (Part I.) we have described the igneous rocks of the Silurian epoch as appearing under a variety of aspects, such as crys talline greenstone, porphyry, granular trap, and a highly cellular amygda loid, differing little from modern lava, except that the cells are filled with various zeolitic minerals. From the local details above given, it wiil be seen that the igneous rocks of the azoic period, though crystalline, compact, and occasionally porphy ritic in their texture, are never amygdaloidal ; and hence we infer that they were produced under widely different conditions. The latter may ha\\e been consolidated beneath the pressure of a deep ocean, while from the former a greater part of this pressure may have been removed ; or it may be that both were, in the first instance, equally vesicular, but that the latter assumed a crystalline or compact structure from long-continued exposuie to heat, under immense pressure. All the phenomena would seem to indi cate that the eruption of the trappean rocks of this period took place be neath an ocean of great depth ; or, at least, under conditions widely dif ferent from those which prevailed during the formation of the trappeau belts of Keweenaw Point and Isle Royale."], [309, "[4] 33 REMARKS. The investigations of geologists in different parts of the world, within the last few years, have clearly demonstrated the existence of a series of non-fossiliferous rocks below the Silurian or Cambrian systems, and there can be no doubt that they are destined to occupy a conspicuous place in the classification of the rocks both of Europe and America. At the meeting of the American Association at Cincinnati, in the spring of 1851, we made the development of this system in the northern portion of the United States and Canada the special subject of a communication. Profes sor Mather, after having confirmed the accuracy of our views, from per sonal observation, stated that he had observed the continuation of this sys tem near the sources of the Mississippi, and on the waters of the St. Peter's. Its existence in Missouri, where it is associatee' as on Lake Superior, with immense beds of magnetic and specular iron ore, is rendered certain by the observations of Mr. Mersch, which will be found incorporated in the sub sequent pages of this report. At this meeting, Dr. King, who has exam ined this region with much care, confirmed these views, and we regret that the proceedings have not yet been made public, that we might quote his remarks in full. Dr. Engelman, also, on that occasion, described a series of azoic rocks, as occurring in Arkansas, between Little Rock and the Hct Springs, which present a striking analogy with those of Missouri and Lake Superior, con sisting of talcose, silicious and crystalline hornblende slates, often highly inclined, with beds of dark-blue limestone. On these older rocks, rests un conformably a sandstone, probably analogous to that of Lake Superior. Within this district of non-fossiliferous, stratified rocks, occurs a beautiful syenite. The vast masses of micaceous, or sub-magnetic oxide of iron, which occur in Missouri, find their representative in the well known \" Arkan sas Magnets,\" or, in the iron ore of Magnet Cove. It is here associated with the interesting titaniferous minerals, schorlamite, arkansite, or Brook ite, and also, el\u00e6olite. Dr. E. thinks hs has traced this series on thi northern branches of the Colorado in Texas. In the eastern portions of the United States, there can be no doubt of the existence of this system. We are satisfied from personal observation that it flanks the Adirondack range in New York, where it is associated with hypersthene rocks and with masses of sub-magnetic oxide of iron, below the Potsdam sandstone. The Messieurs Rogers describe a series of obscurely stratified rocks in Pennsylvania and Virginia occupying the same relative position, known as the gneissoid series. They undoubtedly flank the Appalachian chain on Ex.\u2014 S"], [310, "34 [4] the east, throughout their entire range, and will probably be found well developed in Tennessee and North Carolina. In Europe, the existence of this series has been established beyond con troversy. It has been shown by eminent geologists, especially by Murchi son and de Verne'uil,* that the lowest beds in Scandinavia, containing the least traces of organic life, are the exact equivalents of the Lower Silurian strata of the British Isles, and that these have been distinctly formed out of, and rest upon, slaty and other rocks which had undergone crystalliza tion before their particles were ground up and cemented together again to i compose the earliest beds in which organic life is traceable. \" To this incst ancient system cf rocks in Scandinavia, they have given the name ct azoic. By this term, they do not mean dogmatically to assert that nothing organic could have been in existence during the earliest times, when those rocks were in the process of formation, but simply to express the great fact, that, as far as our present state cf knowledge gees, we look ill vain for any traces of organic life, and it seems probable that they were formed under such physical conditions that nothing living could have flourished during that period. The great mass of rocks in Scandinavia is matle up of a crystalline, cranitic gneiss, presenting an almost infinite succession of feldspathic, quartzose, micaceous and hornblendic lamin\u00e6, wLich are eften highly cen tered, though a general strike or direction may be traced ever a large tract of country. These recks are by no means to le confounded with the metamorphic Silurian strata, occurring under a simi'ar and pnr.legccs form in the same country. These azoic rocks are often tlisturbed and cut through by dykes of greenstone and traversed by countless veins of granite. It is evident from the direct comparison cf the more ancient azoic with newer metamorphic Silurian, that, from lithological characters alone, no distinction could be drawn between them, and it is only where the most conclusive evidence is afforded, by superposition of the latter unconforma bly upon the former, that they can be clearly recognized and dtsined as belonging to different ages. De la Beche remarks that, although alterations in the mineral character of the fossiliferous rocks, from the influence of intruded igneous matter in a molten state, or arising from other modifying causes, often produce mica slates, hornblende slates, gneiss and other forms of laminated and stratified deposits, with a peculiar aspect, there appears, nevertheless, evidence in Scandinavia and the British Isles, and also in other parts of Europe, to show that, beneath all the fossiliferous rocks, there are mica and chlorite slates, quartz rocks, crystalline limestones, gneiss, hornblende, and other rocks of earlier production. These may be, indeed, merely altered, or met- * Russia and tho Ural. Mountains, Vol. 1, p 10."], [311, "4] 35 amorphosed, detrital and chemical deposits of earlier times, and possibly organic remains may eventually be discovered in them; but until this shall happen, it seems desirable to keep them asunder, for the convenience of , showing previous accumulations to those known as the Cambrian group. He, therefore, proposes the name of Mjna Series for the reception of these older rocks, which are well displayed in the island of Anglesea, in con- nection with thus? of the succeeding group.* In the admirable and detailed examinations of the Geological Survey of Wales, where the numerous intercalated beds of trappean rocks and the complicated series of faults have rendered the task of unravelling the geo logy one of great difficulty, the surveyors have clearly shown the existence of this azoic series below the lowest Silurian strata, which is there repre sented by the sandstone of Barmouth and Harlech. Barrande, also, in his investigations of the Bohemian basin, has recog nized a series of semi-crystalline slates alternating with compact argilla ceous slates, below the lowest Silurian strata, in which he has failed to detect any trace of organic life ; hence he has applied the name azoic to these roeks without meaning to assert positively, that the series is absolutely destitute of all traces, bat simply as indicating the great fact that, thus far, none have been discovered. \u2022 Ideological Obsarver, pp. Cl, 3i"], [312, "36 [4] CHAPTER III.

' We shall use the term granite in an extended sense, as comprehending not only those compounds of feldspar, quartz, and mica, which form gra nite proper ; but those compounds consisting of feldspar and quartz, to which the specific name of pegmatite has been assigned by the French, and those of feldspar, quartz anel hornblende, usually known as syenite. - The gradations between the most ancient granites and the products of existing volcanoes are innumerable. There appears, however, this differ ence between them, that while the latter have been poured out in lava cur rents, the former have been elevateel in a softened condition, forming vast, irregular masses, or bosses, over which the incumbent strata are often folded. They have not been protruded from narrow apertures, like the basalts, but from widely-extending gorges.* The granites often occur in long, narrow lines, termed elvans, which appear to differ in no respect from greenstone dykes, except in composi tion, and also in ramifying veins, filling up the preexisting fissures. In most regions where granite constitutes the prevailing rock, the hills assume a rounded outline, and afford few scenes of picturesque beauty. We meet with no over-hanging cliffs, no needle-shaped peaks shooting up into the sky, no narrow and intricate defiles, where the sunlight rarely penetrates. All of the angular points are smoothed off, as though the plough and the harrow had passed over the region. The granite masses are characterized by tabular divisions, which often communicate to them a stratiform appearance. Where it occurs, says Von Buch, in large insulated masses of a faintly arched ellipsoid form, it is covered by a crust, or shell, cleft into blocks \u2014 instances of which are met with, alike in the Harz district, the Mysore, and lower Peru. * Humboldt. Cosmos, Vol. I p. 258. To use the language of an eminent observer, \" imagine a large wedge forced from below through a sheet of thick ice on a river, or pond. First, the ica rises in an angle that becomes sharper and higher, as the wedge rises : then it cracks and opens, presenting its upturned edges on both sides, and through comes the wedge. And this is a very different process from what takes place when the ice merely cracks and the water issues through the crack. In the one case there is a rent, and water diffused over th\u00bb snrf.ice : in the other there is the projecting wedge, flanked by the upturned edges of tJ\u00bb ice.\"\u2014 Hugh Miller."], [313, "37 [4] At the cataracts of the Orinoco, Humboldt saw granite in large flattened spherical masses, which could be divided, like basalt, into concentric layers. GRANITIC ROCSS OF THE NOBTHESN SHOKE. Granite forms, for the most part, the rim of the Lake Superior basin. The culminating points between the lake and Hudson's bay, on the north, the branches of the Mississippi on the south-west, and Green Bay on the south, are of this formation. It appears in low, undulating hills, nowhere attaining a greater elevation than 25p0 feet above the ocean. On the northern shore, it is more widely distributed than on the southern ; but its geographical boundaries have been imperfectly determined. We propose to give, in a condenseel form, a brief description of its distribution on both shores of the lake. Beginning at Pigeon river, in the north-western extremity of the lake, we find, according to Professor Mather, a mass of granite forming the east ern extremity of the peninsula, where it appears in high ridges. It is com posed of the two minerals, red feldspar and quartz, closely aggregated, and is traversed by heavy dykes of greenstone, and veins of quartz and calc spar, containing the bi-sulphuret of iron. A range, according to Mr. Logan, commences at Fort William, and, keeping north of the Kaministiquia river, is prolonged in a north-easterly direction, flanked on either side by beds of gneiss and chlorite slate. It intersects the coast about ten miles below the mouth of the stream, and is seen at intervals along the shore, for a considerable distance ; it then recedes inland, and, crossing the isthmus between Thunder and Black bays, regains the water, about nine miles from the bight of the latter, in a spur terminating at Granite islet. The main range is protracted in a northerly direction, intersecting the Neepigon river some distance above the second rapid, and again approaches the lake near the mouth of Jack river, which falls into a deeply-indented cove in Neepigon bay. Farther on, it emerges from the overlying sandstone and trap, and appears on the bay at a point a little west of north from the entrance to the Chenal Ecarte \u2014 the strait between Simpson's island and St. Ignace. Cutting across a projecting point of sand, it forms a bold, rocky coast, crowned by occasional masses of trap, along the north side of Grand Detroit, as far as Les Petits Ecrits, where it is intersected by trap dykes, running in an easterly and westerly direction. In the north-eastern extremity of the lake, the coast from Pic river to Otter Cove is formed by a gneissoid rock, which a few miles inland attains, according to Bayfield, an elevation of eight hundred feet above the lake. From Otter Cove to Michipicoten river, the coast is occupied by alternate reaches of granite and slate. With the exception of a few square miles of trap at Gargantua, granite and gneiss are the only rocks exposed along the shore until we arrive in the vicinity of Pointe aux Mines, a distance of about fifty miles, at the ex tremity of which they separate from the shore, maintaining a nearly straight south-easterly line across the eastern part of Batcheewauaung Bay, leaving the trap of Mamainse between them and the lake. Thence, they strike ths northern part of Goulais Bay, and finally attain the pro*"], [314, "[41 38 montory of Gros Cap, where they form a moderately bold range of hills, running eastwardly towards Lake Huron.* With ren-ard to the composition of this rock, Mr. I cgan remarks, that the base is granite occasionally passing into syenite by the addition of hornblende; but the latter does not appear to be often present wholly without the mica. Both the mica and hornblende are, in general, black, the quartz, either opake or translucent-white, or colorless, or ti ansparent. The color of the feldspar is usually some shade of red, and, being the prevailing mineral, gives in most cases a reddish tinge to the mass. GRANITIC ROCKS OF THE SOUTHERN SHORE. Crossing over to the southern shore, we find the coast intersected, at rare intervals, by granite masses.' Between Huron Bay ar.d Carp river, a few pcints composed of this rock are observed, generally^ connected with the main-laud Ly n neck of sandstone \u2014 as for instance, at Granite Point, and Dead river. There are several islands in this vicinity composed in the mrin cf granite; but, on the lee-side, patches of sanelstone are seen, which have escaped tie general elenudation to which this region has been sub jected. The Huron islands, according to Mr. Hill's observations, rise from eighty to one hundred feet above the lake, and are composed of granite. It is t ot improbable that, at no very remote epoch, they were connected with ;he main shore by a neck of sandstone, as is seen at this time at Granite Point. The surface of these is'ands is bare and relished, and traversed by nuncr ous stri\u00e6, bearing N. 20\u00b0 E. and S.20\" W. Nowhere on the southern co^st, have we seen these evidences of the drift epoch so well desired. It is only in the fissures of the rock that trees take roct and grow with a stinted growth, and hence these islands present an inhospitable appearance. This granite, unlike most of that found on the southern shore, contains-conside rable mi:a, and is intersected by several systems of joints cutting it into tabular plates, which will materially aid the quarry-man in his labors. It affords admirable materials for construction, and the day may not be far distant when quarries will be opened to supply the cities of the lakes. Ths rock may be quarried almost by the water's edge, and vessels can approach within a few yards anvl be protecteil from every wind. Granite island is a nearly baje mass of rock \u2014 comprising an area of two or three hundred square feet \u2014 on the top of which a few straggling cedars maintain a sickly growth. It is situateel about six miles from the mair-land, and three or four degrees east of north from Granite Point. Middle island also belongs to this class of formations. The granite con sists of the binary compound of feldspar and quartz. Powerful elykes or greenstone intersect the mass, some of which are ninety feet in width, and we countedmo les.-; than six within the distance of forty rods. They cut the granite in remarkably straight lines, (see Fig. 4,) leaving clean, smooth edges, as though the shock by which the original fissures were formed, had been suddenly applied. In the smaller elykes, the green stone is Very compact and fine-grained ; but in the larger, while it exhiLits this texture near the edges, towards the centre it becomes highly crystal- \u2022 Canada Report for 18-19-i\", p. 22 Et Sag."], [315, "M] 39 Kae,\u2014 difference \"*h!ch may have resulted from the relative slowness, or rapidity, with which portions of the mass parted with their heat, in the process of consolidation. There are two systems of dykes; one set bears nearly east and west, while the other bears north-east and south-west; these, in their tujn, are intersected by veins of quartz, as seen on the northern side of the island. The contour cf the mass is rounded, and nu Fig- 4- Cr.'enstone Dyka at Middle Island. mercus deep stri\u00e6, some cf which are two feet in depth and four sett m width, were observed, bearing N. 20\u00b0 W., S. 20\u00b0 E. Several granite islets aprear eff Presqu'isle, but es they differ in no re spect in structure frem Middle island, a faithcr description is deemed un necessary. These islands are but the cutiiers of a mars which, in cur district, is spread over an area cf more than 2000 square miles. It has an extremely irregular outline, which cannot well be defined by a verbal description'. The reader, therefore, is referred to the general Map cf the region for a representation of its boundaries. Granite forms the coast between Prerqu'isle arc! Grr.ritc Tcint. Proceed ing westwardly, it expa'nds rapidly until it attains a width cf twenty-five miles \u2014 a spur shooting off to the north-west, known as the Huron moun tains \u2014 and, after having passed the Machi-gnmmi, contracts equally rapidly, and terminates on the sources cf the Sturgeon river. The extreme lergth of this granite axis is about sixty miles, and its culminating points rise 1*00 feet above the lake. Another granite boss rises to the south of that above described, and ranges in a nearly parallel direction for about thirty-six miles. The interval between them is from twelve to fifteen miles in width, occupied by crystalline schists, marbles, beels of quartz, and specular iron. Farther west, another granite belt starts frem the head waters of the Ontonagon river, and thence extends to the western limits of the district, intersecting the head of Agogebic lake, and crossing the Montreal river about fifteen miles from its mouth. Southward, it forms the water-shed between the rivers of Lake Superior and the Mississippi, and passes beyond the limits of this district into Wisconsin. It is probable that this belt is a continuation of that first described, but we have not been able to trace the continuity. There is an interval of twenty miles, where the surface of the country becomes nearly horizontal, and is strown with accumulations of clay and gravel, burying up the subjacent rocks."], [316, "40 [4J There art, also, numerous, insulated patches of granite scattered through the crystalline schists, the positions of which are indicated on the accom panying map. . ' The granite, for the most part, forms numerous parallel ridges, bearing east and west, which are rounded and featureless. The rocks rarely emerge to the surface in mural escarpments, but are concealed by the debris of ages. Dense forests of maple and yellow birch, interspersed with pine and hemlock, clothe the ridges, while the intervals are occupied by almost impassable marshes, filled with tamarack, cedar, and alder, or by natural meadows, in which the blue-joint (Calamagrostis canadensis) flourishes with rank luxuriance. A chain of small lakes is often observed, hemmed in by the parallel ridges, whose outlet is through some tranverse gorge, formed, not by the erosive action of water, but by a fissure in the rocky barrier. The greater portion of the surface occupied by this class of rocks has not yet been sub-divided, and hence it is, that the maps representing its area are so deficient in topographical information. Of the whole district, the grani tic region possesses the least economical value. There appear to be no metallic veins worthy of exploration, and from the broken and rugged char acter of the surface, it is ill adapted to agricultural purposes. Besides, its remoteness from navigable water will retard its immediate settlement. Local Details. \u2014 We do not propose to make a transcript of our note books. Such a transcript would encumber the report with unnecessary details, and serve no useful purpose. We shall extract such portions only as illustrate some interesting problem in geology, or furnish facts of econo mical value. Sections extending through the elifferent systems of rocks ot this region, possess great uniformity, wherever taken, and their multiplica tion would throw little additional light upon its geological structure. We shall, therefore, content ourselves with a few illustrations of this nature. Besides, in a region so vast as this, where the physical obstructions to its successful exploration are so formidable, it has been found impossible, with the means placed at our disposal, to make but little more than a general reconnoissance. We have only attempted to delineate its more pro minent features, while to those who succeed us, we leave the more difficult task of sketching in the individual lineaments. That task cannot be suc cessfully executed, until the country shall become intersected by roads and dotted with human habitations ; until portions of the forests, which now cover the whole surface, become levelled by the axe, and the underlying rocks exposed in pits and quarries. Practical geologists alone can appre ciate the aid afforded by these artificial excavations. It is not from wandering over the hills, or drift-covered plains, that he arrives at the structural relations of a country ; but, by following up the beds of small streams, where the superficial covering has been removed, by examining epiarries, where the fresh surfaces of the rocks are exposed to thejlay, anu by scrutinizing the materials thrown out from wells and pits. The subjoined section will serve to illustrate the order of position in the different groups of rocks, between Lake Superior and Lake Michigan. It commences on the township line between ranges 3G and 38, and ex-"], [317, "[4] 41 tends thence, in a southerly direction to the mouth of the Escanaba river, a distance of about seventy miles. Proceeding inland from the shore of Lake Su perior, our route for the first six miles is over low, marshy groun I, supposed to be underlaid by the Potsdam -andstone, in a nearly horizontal posi tion. Occasionally vestiges of ancient terraces are observed, indicating the former boundaries of the lake. Where the sandstone is exposed by the lake shore, it is of a dark-red color, and con tains numerous white blotches, like those at To bacco river and Granite Point. A low granite ridge is first observed, according to Mr. Hill, a mile west of the corner of sections 34 and 33, along the south boundary of township 50, range 26. Fragments of slate are seen at it's base, so that it is not improbable that a portion of the azoic system is interposed, at this point, as at many others, between the granite and the Potsdam sandstone. In section I, along the east boundary of township 49, range 27, a ridge of granite four hundred and seventy-two feet in height is observed, bearing N. 20\u00b0 E. It consists for the most part of the ternary com pound of feldspar, quartz and mica, differing in this respect from that seen by the lake shore. Hornblende occasionally replaces the mica, form ing syenite, the prevailing color being light-grey. Powerful dykes of greenstone traverse the mass in a direction parallel to its prolongation. There are also seen numerous granite veins, seldom ex ceeding eight inches in width, ramifying through the granite, and occasionally through the green stone. Mica is more abundantly disseminated through these veins than in the adjoining walls, \u2014 an interesting fact, since it tends to confirm its volcanic origin ; for this substance has been detected not only in the ancient basalts but in the pjoducts of existing volcanoes. Gneiss is ob served to flank thS granite both on the north and on the south, with intercalated beds of quartz and feldspar, and imperfectly laminated hornblende, \u2014 the whole dipping uniformly from the axis of elevation. These might with pro priety be regarded as the more highly metamor phosed portions of the azoic system. On section 7, another range of granite is passed, 'four hundred and ninety feet in height, bearing nearly east and west, which rises ra- Fig. 6. pidly to the westward of the line of section; but to the eastward verges to a level. Gneiss is seen along its flank? to near the summit, which consists oi a dark-colored, crystalline mass,"], [318, "HI 42 In section 18, numerous low ridges of granite occur, flanked by gneiss and hornblende. \u2022 \" Near the north line of section 19, a ridge of granite is seen which attains an altitude of seven hundred and seventy feel, and bears nearly east and west, with gneiss and slaty hornblende along its slopes. The greater por tion of the line through this section passes over hornblende slate ; but, near the southern boundary, the granite breaks through the incumbent rocks and rises to the height of eight hundred and sixty-seven feet above the lake. The mass consists of feldspar, quartz and black mica, the latter so far predominating as to communicate to it a dark color. We here reach th<- boundary between the igneous and the metamorphic rocks, and it will be seen that as we recede from that line, the rocks be come less crystalline in their texture and exhibit more distinct traces of bedding. The gneiss, the compact hornblende, and the quartz and feldspar rocks, exhibiting a massive structure, will be found passing into, or succeeded by, heels of argillaceous, talcose and chlorite slate, and quartzose rocks, enveloping pebbles and displaying obscure lines of strati fication. To the south of the last described ridge, along the western boundary of section 30, the line passes over hornblende rocks somewhat fissile, contain ing seams of quartz conformable in dip and bearing to the enclosing mass. About one-fourth of a mile south of the northern boundary of township 48, the talcose slates, with planes of bedding, are seen for the first time. The surface here attaint an altitude of 1004 feet, which is higher than any of the granite ridges along the line of the section. The valley of Dead river sinks down nearly seven hundred feet, and the underlying rock con sists apparently of talcose and argillaceous slates. To the south, in sec tions 13 and 24, hornblende slates reappear and occupy a width of about a mile and a half. In section 24, they are succeeded by talcose slates ; but, in section 25, the hornblende slates are again observed, and there is no marked change in the rocks until we arrive in section 36, when the talccse schists reappear, dipping to the south at an angle of C8\u00b0. About a fourth of a mile north of Teal lake, a quartz range is intersected, bearing nearly east and west, which forms one of the- most striking topo graphical features of the country. Its altitude is nine hundred and forty four feet above the level of Lake Superior, and throughout its entire range, it rises sharp anel well-elefined. The quartz exhibits imperfect lines of bedding, and displays a slightly granular texture. Beneath this is a led of novaculite ten feet in thickness, which possesses a sine grit and affords an admirable material for hones. To this succeed talccse slates, the whole dipping 66\u00b0 to the south. In section 32, township 48, range 26, a quartzose conglomerate is ob served ten feet in thickness, the included pebbles consisting of quartz from the size of a buck-shot to that of a hen's egg. A few yards to the south-west of the Jackson Company's Forge, this same quartzose conglomerate is seen; but the pebbles do not attain so large a size. These beds, although greatly transformed by reason of their proximity to igneous rocks, still retain traces of their mechanical origin. Not far from the southern margin of Teal lake, there rises a range of hills composed of dark-colored anel compact hornblende rocks, which here forms the \" divortia aquaium\" between the river systems of the two gr\u00abat"], [319, "[4] 43 lakes. The sources of the Escan&ba approach within a quarter of a mik of Teal lake, which is drained by the Carp river of Lake Superior. _ In following the line of our section to the southward, still continuing between ranges 26 and 27, we find a belt of about five miles in width, extending to near the north-cast corner of section 36, township 47, range 27, occupied by the slates of the azoic series, and the intercalated beds of trappean rock. The latter, however, largely predominate in apparent thickness, the ridges being numerous, and mostly of a dark-green horn blendic trap. Near the line between sections 1 and 12, a ridge of green crystalline trap occurs, flanked on the south by hornblende slates, some what talcose in their composition, and clipping to the south at an angle of 63\u00b0. A mile farther south, the country gradually rises, with alternate rido-es of trappean rock, and bands of nornbltnde slates, which have a finely schistose structure. On the north side of section 13, the slates become more silicious, and stand nearly vertically ; and, then again, are succeeded by low ridges and rounded crests of a hard, compact, greenish, trappean rock. At the corner between sections 13 and 24, the hornblende slates are highly impregnated with oxide of iron, which occasionally forms quite pure bancls i.i the slaty rock. The ground continues elevated along the eastern line of section i3, being about 1030 feet above Lake Superior, and is partially covered by drift; two mi'es' farther west, however, the rock is exposed along the whole length of the line between sections 14 and 15, and pre sents a constant succession of steep ridges of a dark and crystalline green stone, no slates being visible in the depression netween the rilges. Near the corner of sections 24 and 25, we find an abundance of angular frag ments of slaty hornblende-rock, containing iron, and masses of quartz, with specular iron. These rocks rise into a dome-shaped protuberance a little to the east of the line of section 25, and have, here, an elevation of about 12 JJ feet above Lake Superior. The slaty rocks are so impregnated with iron, at this point, as to become very good ores. On the line between sections 29 and 32, is a remarkable knob of con glomerate, alike interesting from the fact that such a form of rock is of rare occurrence among the azoic series of this district, and from its intimate connection with the origin of the masses of iron in its vicinity. The con glomerate forms here an isolated, rounded elevation rising at least a hundred feet above the general level. It is made up of coarse blocks of various sorts which belong to the neighboring trappean and slaty beds, and are o very considerable dimensions. Among them we recognized, not only frag ments of the rock associated with the iron; but masses of the iron itself, and of the banded and jaspery varieties. Most of the fragments of this remarkable breccia are but slightly rounded and worn on their edges, having in this respect much more the appearance of a friction-conglomerate than of one in which the long-continued action of water had played a part The blocks are cemented together by a very hard, ferruginous paste. The nature of the surrounding country, covered with soil and forest-trees, pre vented us from satisfactorily tracing its connection with the adjoining rocks. We are inclined, however, to regard it as connected with the \u2022eruption of the adjacent granite, and rather as the effect of the crushing and elevating forces which such an elevation must have called into play. If this is the case, it may be considered as analogous in its mode of form ation to the conglomerates of Keweenaw Point. A fact worthy of notice"], [320, "[4J 44 in this connection is, that, in spite of the heterogenous structure of the mass, it exhibits a distinct tendency to separate, or flake off, in thick con centric layers, like some eruptive granites. The nature of the fragments composing this breccia, and of she cement by which they are united, proves conclusively that the process of for mation of the ores of iron, and the impregnation of the slaty rocks with metallic matter, must have been one of long continuance, and not a merely momentary operation. The various kinds of ore must have been in exist ence before the formation of this mass, but they were subsequently broken off and mingled together in confusion. Emanations of metallic matter must still have been issuing from beneath, since we find the whole deposit thoroughly impregnated with it, and converted into one firmly coherent mass. Near the south-eastern corner of section 25, (township 47, range 27,) we reach the southern boundary of the slaty and trappean rocks, and strike the belt of granite which intervenes between them and the Potsdam sandstone, on the south side of the axis. The width of the granitic belt along this line of section is about ten miles, since it extends south as far as the centre of township 45, where it was first seen in place by Mr. Hall, in ascending the Escanaba. The height of the land at the point of junction of the granite and slates, is about six hundred and fifty feet above Lake Superior. \u2022 The whole surface covered by this belt of granite is low and swampy, the rock rising out of the ground in narrow and precipitous ridges, a number of which are crossed by this line of section. They vary fiom twenty to fifty feet in height above the adjacent surface, and have an eleva tion of from six to seven hundred feet above Lake Superior. These ridges ' frequently present almost vertical and bare walls en both sides ; and the desolate and forbidding character of the region, consisting mainiy of low and tangled swamps, and barren ridges, can hardly be exaggerateei. The mineralogical constituents of the granite, on this side of the axis, are mainly reddish feldspar and quartz, with but little mica. At the junction of the granite with the azoic slates on the southern side, the relation of the former to the latter is clearly seen. The slaty recks are traversed by injected veins of granite, which gradually increase in number and dimensions as we approach the grannie nucleus. On an almost vertical wall of rock, about forty feet in height, near the south-east Fig. 6. Granite. h. Hornhlcnde-slate. e. Vein of granite. cornet of section 25, (township 47, range 27,) the granite is seen pene trating the hornblende-slate like an immense wedge, and shooting cut in ramifying branches. The preceding figure (Fig. 6,) sK?ws the appear ance of the two rocks at this place. 'j$;"], [321, "[4] 45 Around the portion of the granitic mass, indicated by the letter c, the slaty rock has all the appearance of having been bent and twisted by the injection of the granite vein. The following figure(Fig. /,) represents this portion of the rock on a larger scale than the preceding: Fig. 7. This contorted structure seems to be due, not to an actual crowding back of the schistose rock, but rather to a rearrangement of its particles, occasioned by the presence of the granitic mass. Section from Keweenaw Bay to the mouth of the Menomonee. (See General Section.) \u2014 In ascending the first granite axis back cf Keweenaw bay, its northern limits are observed to extend to within two miles of the boundary between townships 48 and 49, range 33, approaching within six miles of the lake shore. It is exposed in a murai cliff facing the south, about thirty feet high ; it is of a light-grey color, and composed of an in finite number of crystalline plates, confusedly aggregated, in which the three constituents feldspar, quartz and mica, may be recognized. The altitude of this ridge is 1064 feet above Lake Superior. Descending into a longitudinal valley, the granite is occasionally exposed in low ledges, having a rounded form. Crossing the range line, it reappears in a cliff fifteen or twenty feet in height, traversed by numerous and remarkably regular divisional lines. At the outlet of a small lake which is one of the reservoirs of Sturgeon river \u2014 near the east part of township 49, range 33 \u2014 it is again seen, under the form of well-characterized syenite. In ear the centre of township 49, range 33, we ascended an abrupt ridge, three hun dred feet above the surrounding level, composed of rose.-colored feldspar and quartz, and traversed by numerous veins of quartz and chlorite. Sy enite reappears along the north line of township 48, range 32. A mile farther south the granite rises to the height of 1198 feet above Lake Supe rior, forming the culminating point of this region. The southern boundary of this belt, which is here about ten miles in width, occurs north of Sagiag&ns. One of the sources of the Sturgeon river crosses this belt twice in this vicinity. It rises near the northern group of azoic slates and, flowing south, cuts through the main axis and sweeps around its base ; then recrosses if, traversing the whole belt in a northwesterly direction. The course of this stream has probably been determined by transverse fissures extending across the entire axis. , The granite, it will be seen, forms a series of parallel ridges, bearing nearly east and west. The gentler slopes verge towards the north, while the precipitous escarpments front the south. The longitudinsj valleys con-"], [322, "[ 4 ] ' 46 tain numerous natural meadows, or small wet prairies, destitute of trees an I clothed with a rank growth of blue-joint grass. They appear to have been the bsds of ancient lakes which have been filled by the debris of the surrounding hills, or drained by the abrarion of their former barriers. The prevailing growth on the ridges is maple, yellow birch and ash, interspersed with colossal pines, sometimes one hundred and fifty feet in height and six feet in diameter. The low grounds are occupied by dense thickets of alder, ce l.ir and spruce, which are hung with long festoons of mess. The second granite axis, where it crosses the Machi-gamig (township 45, range 2 J,) is much contracted in dimensions, being only about five miles in vvi ith, an 1 attaining but a slight elevation above the surrounding country. It c insists of quartz and feldspar in large crystals, presenting, in many p! ices, tie asp?ct of graphic granite. In crossing portage No. 5, it is seen i i low ri Iges running east and west, having a rounded contour. Mr. Pill, e :;More I this zone further east, and from his notes we gather the following i.iformation. St irting on the line between ranges 58 and 29, in township 43, and pro ceeding north, he describes the country as low and marshy, and so thorough ly covered with transported materials that the underlying rocks are almost entirely conce.tVtl. The line of junction between the granite and sand stone was not observed; but is supposed to occur near the northern part cf the township, since here, for the first time, loose blocks of sandstone were n^i ed, which were supposed to have been derived from the immediate vicinity. The granite is first observed on the line between sections 13 and 12, in a low exposure. Near the south-east corner of section 36, town ship 44, a low, rounded ledge is seen, rising up through the surrounding swamp. Along this line, through the whole township, frequent exposures of this i haracter are observed. ' The southern portion of township 45, range 29, is lew rnd marshy; 1 ut t'le northern portion is broken, and the granite apj ears in numerous knots and ridges. In seeiions 1, II and 12, dykes of greenstone are seen to cut t'le granite in numerous places. In section 13, a large dyke occurs, bear ing east and west, and varying but little from a perpendicular in its down ward course. Its mineral components are hornblende and feldspar intimately mixed, with crystals of c/> sy feldspar disseminated. There seem to be, aeei,rding to the observations of Mr. Hill, two gene ral systems of dykes in this region, though subject to minor deviations ; one bears N. from 70\u00b0 to 80\u00b0 W., the other N. 10\u00b0 E. The east and west elvkes are the main ones, being the widest, longest and best defined. Lines if division were everywhere noticed, one set bearing N. 75\u00b0 or 80\u00b0 W and another from S. 10\u00b0 E. to S. 10\u00b0 W. Near the north boundary of township 46, range 28, gneiss is seen sup-, sorted by granite on the south : on sections 3 and 4, heavy dykes of green stone, ranging east and west, traverse the mass. Some chlorite slate is i ?en between sections 46 and 47, where the Escanaba river crosses the line, Janking the hornblende ridges to the east and north. Along the line between sections 27 and 23, township 47, and in sections ; \") and 31, the granite is traversed by two greenstone dykes, bearing east a.vl west, each of which is nearly eight hundred feet in width, composed of -I 'use of compact hornblende and feldspar, with glassy crystals of the latter \u2022Inseminated. The granite in this vicinity consists of a highly crystalline"], [323, "[4] 47 compound of feldspar and quartz, with an occasional admixture of horn blende. On following the granite region westwardly from the Escanaba river, where it crosses township 46, range 27 and 28, we find it possessing nearly the same mineralogical character, and similar in its mode of occurrence to that already described. This belt of igneous rock crosses the Machi-gamig river in township 46, range 29, and pursues a westerly course, bending to the southward, for about twelve miles to the west of that stream. Beyond this point, it can no longer be traced, except in occasional knobs and ridges which rise out of the predominating slaty rocks. There are numerous intrusive masses of granite scattered through the azoic series of the southern portion of the district ; indeed, so numerous are the successions, and so complicated the relations of the two recks with the accompanying trappean belts, and so great the diversity cf character, that it would require much more time than we were able to elevote to this part of the reodon, even under the most favourable circumstances of exposure ot the rocks, to make out its detailed structure. We must content ourselves, therefore, with a general outline of the most conspicuous points. The granite rises in low ridges from amidst the talcose, hornblende, and chlorite slates, in townships 41, 42, 43 and 44, through the whole district westward to 45. It is more quartzose than in the northern townships ; mica is generally present in small quantity, and often arranged in parallel layers, so that the mass assumes a gneissoid structure. This mineral is generally very dark-colored, sometimes black, and, for the most part, occurs in minute plates. In the extreme western portion of the district, west of range 41, granite is the predominating rock below the southern boundary of township 47, and is associated with a hornblende-rock, which sometimes assumes a slaty structure. The granite is mostly a binary compound of felelspar and quartz, the former largely predominating, and giving a reddish tinge to the whole rock ; mica is present only in very small quantity, while horn blende and chlorite are occasionally scattered in minute particles through it. Nearly the whole of the granitic region in this part of the district presents the most so. bidding and desolate aspect. Though it forms the most elevated portion of the country, being the water-shed between Lake Superior and the M srissippi, it is low and swampy, and filled with numerous lakes, of which over fifty were crossed by Mr. Burt, in survey ing the boundary-line between Lac Vieux Desert and the Montreal river. There are occasional elevations, which are dry, and wooded with sugar maple, and which, undoubtedly, are covered with a gootl soil ; but, the larger portion of the region presents almost interminable cedar-swamps, in the midst of which the granite and hornblende ridges rise, with precipitous walls, rarely to more than fifty feet in height above the surrounding coun try. These ridges are generally very narrow, and their sides are covered with a thick coating of moss and lichens. Nothing can exceed the eleso late solitude of this region. Not even the Indian traverses it ; it is desti tute of game, and its stillness is never broken, except by the crashing cf the tornado through the dense forest, tearing up the trees, and piling them together, so as to present an almost impassable barrier, as if still farther to repel the intmsbn of man into a region, so little fitted for his recep tion."], [324, "L4] 48 The granite of the whole of this portion of the district is very coarse grained and crystalline, and is characterized by a predominance of feldspar, and an almost entire absence of mica. Age of the Granites. \u2014 The granites of the Lake Superior region evi dently belong to two different epochs of upheaval. That of the north western coast of the lake, in the vicinity of Pigeon river, was elevated before the close of the azoic period, since the upper portion of the slates reposes horizontally around it; whi'e that of the north-eastern coast, and that which forms the axis between the river systems of the two lakes, was elevated after the termination of the azoic period, and before the dawn of the Silurian, since the granite has disturbed the upper beds of s'ates, while the lower beds of the Potsdam sandstone rest undisturbed around it. Mineraldgicil Compositi n of the Granite. \u2014 The granite, scuth of the belt of azoic rocks in township 46, ranges 25, 26, 27, and 28, is generally made up of feldspar and quartz, mica being almost always wanting, or only present in very small quantity. The feldspar is by far the predomi nating mineral ; in fact, whole ledges in the granitic region are composed almost wholly -of it. It has generally a pale, flesh-red color. On the west side of section 30, township 47, range 27, occurs a beautiful granite, made up principally of large tabular masses of red feldspar, with a little milky quartz, and occasionally a few specks of chlorite. Of the feldspar an analysis was made, to acquire a more definite knowledge of the nature of the alkalies present in this mineral associated with the granite. This analysis gave on 2.0703 grammes of the substance, carefully dried at 100\u00b0 C. Oxygen.

The water is undoubtedly in chemical combination in the mineral, play ing the part of a base. All the feldspars which we have examined, contain more or less water, from one-half to one per cent., which water is not removed by drying, at a temperature of 100\u00b0 to 120\u00b0 C. ; but which ' requires a full red heat for its expulsion. Economic Value of the Granites. \u2014 Many of the feldspathic varieties which occur in the interior readily disintegrate on exposure, and are ill adapted to building purposes. Besides, their remoteness from water com munication woulel prevent their extensive use. There are numerous ledges of almost pure feldspar in this region, which might be advantageously employed in the manufacture of porcelain ware, were they nearer to a manufacturing region. The granite of the Huron islands, as before remarked, is admirably,"], [325, "[4] 49 idapted to the purposes of construction, separating readily into large tabular masses, and resisting the action of atmospheric agents. Trappean Rocks. \u2014 In the preceding chapter, we have described, with some minuteness, the interlaminated masses of igneous rocks which occur in connection with the slates, throughout their entire range ; and, in the present chapter, have noted the occurrence of elifferent systems of dykes traversing the granite. It is, therefore, deemed unnecessary to enter into farther details as to their mode of occurrence, or their range and extent. In a subsequent chapter, will be found the results of a chemical examina tion of many of these igneous products. From the commencement to the termination of the azoic period, as indi cated by the presence of these igneous products, the primeval crust was subject to constantly recurring convulsive movements, manifested unfler fir di.ferent conditions, anrl with fir greater intensity, than what we now behold, even in those districts which are the foci of the volcano and the earthquake. Sometimes the molten materials rose through the deeply seated fissures in long lines of elevation, again they cut through the incum bent strata in the form of dykes, and again flowed x>ver the surface in lava-like sheets. Accustomed as we are at this day to witness the calm operations cf nature, \u2014 operations apparently controlled by fixed and uniform Jaws, and rarely invaded by catastrophes, \u2014 we find it difficult sally to appreciate the turbulence which characterized this period of transition, when first the crust emerged from the watery abysj, and assumed the tlistinctive forms of con tinents and islands."], [326, "[4] 50 CHAPTER IV.

Having, in the preceding chapters, given a description cf the geological relations of the azoic system, we now proceed to consider the mode in which the iron ores are associated with that system ; and, in order to illustrate more fully many of the phenomena exhibited in this district, we shall refer to some of the principal deposits cf a similar character, in ether portions cf the earth. The extent and boundaries cf the azeic system, of which tlere deposits ernstitute a part, have been fully set forth :n the preceding chapters. \u2014 They are, also, delineated on the general map i f the district ; while, en the general section, the relations of the different groups, cie to Eixtler, are portrayed. On the map of the district between Kcweei ! w Bay end Cho colate river, we have indicated the most important and valuable beds of ore by an appropriate symbol, thus (%). From the results of our examinations, it will le seen tint this district is unprecedently rich in the specular and magnetic oxides cf iron, rnd that, so far as relates to the magnitude cf the masses and the purity cf the orts, it stands unrivalled. Thus far, the principal deposits have been found Connected with a belt of crystalline schists and intercalated trappean roeks, bounded on eithtr side, by a belt of granite. This belt extends in an easterly and westerly direction for more than thirty miles, and, in its widest expansion, exceeds eight miles. Proceeding south, for forty miles, along the eastern limits of the azoic system, there are numerous evidences of the existence cf these ores, but nowhere are they observed to be developed en a scale of such magnitude, or in such a state of purity, as those of the belt first alluded to. i The physical obstacles are not of sueh a character as to interpose a formidable barrier to the successful working of these mines. Elevated from eight hundred to twelve hundred feet above the lake, the ground affords a gradual and easy descent; the streams furnish an unlimited amount of water power for the propulsion of machinery, and the magnificent forests of yellow birch and maple will yield an ample supply of chaicoal for the reduction cf the ores; while, at the landing by the lake shore, the lee of Little Presqu'isle"], [327, "[4] 51 forms a shelter for vessels in all but north-east storms. The cities along the shores of the lower lakes will, at all times, afford a market for these products, whether wrought into the finer varieties of bar iron and steel, or in the form of blooms and pigs. When we consider the natural advantages which these localities present, it seems reasonable to suppose, that the day is not distant, when the fabrication of iron will be successfully and exten sively prosecuted in this region. GENERAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE OEES OF HtON. Starting from the shore of Lake Superior, near the mouth of Carp river, and proceeding westwurdly, near the line between townships 47 and 48, we strike the first deposit of iron in the north-east corner of section 1, in town- ship 47, range 27. This is distant about twelve miles from the lake shore, ami, so far as we know, is the most accessible point to navigable water. Throughout the northern, and especially the north-eastern, portion of this township, the iron ores exist in inexhaustible quantity, and under conditions favorable to their development. The only t iwns'oip which, in point of accessibility, and in the abun- dance and parity of these ores, compares with that just mentioned, i3 that a Ij oining on the east, (township 47, range 26.) Here, however, the depo- sits, thin far discovered, are situate 1 near its southern boundary; and, alth vj r'i h reality a litle nearer the lake than those before alluded to, they are inferior in the purity of the ore. lit) v us'iip* 17, range 23, bit few deposits of iron are known to exist, the si.-fciae being canparatively taw an 1 covered with drift. One or two q nrter sectiris on the northern boun lary have been marked with the syin- b>l of iron ( V), x' accodincc with the notes of the linear surveyors, ' tlio lg'i we fiilel to find any be Is of value. On the northern side of sei^tio.i 1.8, ia this to v.isliip, we found specimens which indicated the exist- ence of ore of a goo 1 quality in the neighborhood. In towis'aip 47, range 23, several localities of ore have been obse-.ed, \u2022' in a line nearly due west from the great deposits described as occurring in range 27. \"\u25a0\"Proceeding still farther west, in the next range (townships 48, range 30.) there are abundant traces of iron associated with hornblende rocks, alon* the northern shore of Machi-gummi, while m the adjoing township south\" on section 1, and in the a ljoining township east, on sections 6, 7 and 12,' on the borders of the Machi-gamig river, these deposits are largely devel- oped and possess a considerable degree of purity. , . It is pre5u:ne 1 that these ores are prolonged in their range beyond the Machi-gamig, and in fact their existence, to a limited extents has been as- certained by the linear surveyors ; but the general surface of the re<rion is here intersected by few ridges, and covered over with transported materials, effectually concealing the underlying rocks. Farther west, on the sources of the Bad river, Mr. Whittle\u00e6y, while connected with the survey of the Chippewa district, discovered numerous -deposits of iron, in the azoic series, and under conditions similar to those which prevail here. Crossing the Machi-gamig, the belt of azoic schists sweeps to the south and southwest, intersecting the Menomonee river, along the south-western boundary of our district. Throughout this portion of their range, the oc-"], [328, "[4 ] 52 currence of these ores is by no means rare, but they are nowhere developed on such a scale, or exhibit so great a degree of purity, as those in the vicinity of Teal lake ; some of the beds, however, are valuable, and may ultimately be made available. The most southerly deposits are in township 40, range 30, a few miles east of the Twin falls on the Menomonee river, and are among the most extensive and valuable in this portion of the district. V^hen it is remembered that nearly the whole of this region is an unbroken wilderness \u2014 without a human habitation, if we except the set tlements along the valley of the Carp, or a trace of the labors of man, if we except the surveyor's lines, or the few blind Indian trails \u2014 it seems reasonable to suppose that, at this time, we hav.e but an imperfect idea of the extent of these iron-bearing deposits. The more important masses have been discovered ; but there are, undoubtedly, subordinate beds, equal in purity, and susceptible of being wrought, which will not be revealed until the axe shall level the forests, or the plough strip off the superficial covering. From the above sketch of the geographical range of the principal deposits of iron, it will be noticed 4hafc, in the belt of azoic rocks as far west as the Machi-gamig river, they predominate along the northern side of township 47; so that, if we take a line running due east and west between this township and that of 48, for a distance of about eighteen mijes in length, we shall find nearly all of the valuable deposits concen trated within a short distance to the north and south of that line. A ten dency to the formation of a similar belt may be noticed along the southern side of township 47, where the azoic schists are in close proximity to the granite. PARTICULAR. LOCALITIES OF ORE. We now proceed to a more detailed description of some of the more important iron-deposits of this region. The great similarity which exists among the different'localities, renders it unnecessary to describe all which have been examined in elctail; but, as a guiele to the explorer, we shall insert in the appendix a table of the sections and quarter-sections on which iron ores are known to occur. Township 47, Range 26. \u2014 The principal deposits of specular and mag netic oxide of iron are on and near the line between sections ?7, 28, 23 and 30, and sections 31, 32, 33 and 34 ; they are arranged in a metal liferous belt, bearing nearly east and west. In section 31, the iron ore is finely displa/ed in the bed, and along the banks, of a small stream which is one of the sources of the Escanaba river. At one point, it is precipi tated over a ledge of this ore, from a height of 2% feet, to which fall we have given the name of the \" Iron Cascade.\" The stream is Of sufficient size to furnish water-power, in case a forge should be established here. This ore is a peroxide of iron, mixed with considerable silicious matter, (see analysis,) and seems to exhibit indistinct lines of bedding which dip at a high angle, and are intersected, at nearly right angles, by joints which cut the mass into large tabular blocks. The quantity of the ore is evi dently very great, even at this one locality ; but its limits and thickness could not be ascertained, owing to the heavy accumulations of drift which line the stream on either side above the cascade, forming steep banks some fifty feet in height."], [329, "53 [4] Proceeding eastward, we find, at the north-east corner of the section, and along the section line for the distance of a mile or two, at various points, the apparent prolongation of the same metalliferous band ; but differing in character from that just described. The ore resembles the banded, jaspery deposit, on sections 10 and 11 of the same township, in the next range westerly, known as the Cleveland location. In fact, throughout the whole extent of the azoic series, up to the granite, which makes its appear ance a little north of the south lum of the township, \u2014 the line of demarca tion running nearly east and west along the whole of the township, \u2014 the slaty rocks are so associated with the iron, that it is evident some great, general cause has operated throughout their whole extent to impregnate the entire mass with this metal. The relation of the schistose rocks and the associated ore may be seen from the following section, (Fig. 8,) near the north-east corner of section 31 : Fig. 8. a is a compact, quartzose mass, highly chirged with peroxide of iron, so as to be perfectly black, although distinct grains of quartz can be easily recognized in it. 4 is a somewhat sUty rock, resembling hornblende slate, also impregnated with\" iron, which occasionally forms in it bants of quite pure ore, and in some places alternates with jaspery matter, as at numerous other localities. The presence of the peroxide of iron, in two adjacent rocks of so differ ent mineralogical composition, proves that its diffusion through them must be ascribed to some general cause, quite independent of the nature of the rock itself. We do not regard these ores as equal in value to the purely eruptive ones : an abundance, however, may be obtained, which will probably vield as high as forty, or fifty, per cent of metallic iron. , Along the line between sections 32 and 33, near the junction of the azoic schists with the granite, the relations of the iron and the slatv and quartzose rocks are finely displayed, in a ravine which extends for a cui-sid erable distance to the east and west of this line. The phenomena, l.ere, are of the most complicated and interesting character. On the north side of the ravine, we have the slaty and quartzose rocks dippinn- at a hio-h angle to the north, and presenting a great variety of mineralogical structure. Quartzose bands, composed of fine grains of silicious matter, impregnated with peroxide of iron, with occasional wide bands of pure ore, alternate with a hornblende rock, having a schistose structure, and equally charged with ferruginous matter. The whole appearance of the mass is that of a seriesof beds of quartzose and hornblendic matter, thoroughly impreo-nated with iron and greatly disturbed, and changed from their original structure and position. On the south side of the ravine, at a distance\u00b0of a couple of hundred feet, a complicated succession of trappean and granitic belts, crossed by numerous veins of igneous rock, is presented. Here, however' the rock is no longer charged with iron. Township 47, Range 27.\u2014 Here, the deposits of iron, as before stated, are displayed on a grander scale than in any other portion of the district,"], [330, "s4] 54 and merit a special description ; since they are not only preeminent in quan tity and purity, but are situated so favorably with regard to facility of working and proximity to the lake shore. The location of the Jackson Company embraces section 1, of the above township; but their forges are situated in township 48, range 26, rear the corner of sections 28, 29, 32 and 33 on Carp river, which affords excellent water-power. The ferriferous band here forms a ridge about a thousand feet in width, and from a few feet to' fifty in height, above the general level of the sur rounding country, and can be traced almost continuously across the section in an easterly anel westerly direction. On the northern side of the belt, the ore is compact, and of great purity ; near the centre it exhibits a banded structure, while, to the south, it passed again into the compact variety. The annexed section (Fig. 9,) by Mr. Hill, will serve to illustrate these charges, and show the connection of the iren with the associated recks. Tig. 0 13 15 5 2 4 Section of the Jackson Ore Eed.

Thus, it will be seen that this deposit is bounded en the south by a purely igneous reck (4), and on the nerth by slaty, chlcritic beds (1), the dip being about G'4\u00b0 to the north. Towards the centre of the mr.rs, the oie is less pure, ar.d passes into the br.rded variety. Nimeicus veir.s cf quartz (5) cut the great mass of ore, end contain specular oxide in large, brilliant plates, which present quite a different appearance frem the ore which they traverse. The character of the ore of this locality is somewhat various at different points; but, in general, it possesses a remarkable degree cf purity \u2014 for a description anel analysis of which, see the chemical composition of the iron ores in the succeeding chapter. The iron has been worked to a limited extent in an open quarry, but there are loose blocks enough scattered along the base of the cliff to supply a furnace for many years. The same deposit, above described on section 1, continues westerly into section 2 ; but this latter section is far less valuable. The trappean rocks here form a bold ridge along its northern boundary, being a continuation of the ridge on section 1. In the sections still farther west of this tier nothing of value ha6 been eliscovered. In the north-east corner of section 12, next south of section 1, there are evidences of a deposit of iron in the deep red soil and large masses of ore, which lie near the surface on the side of a hill, of which the summit is a crystalline trappean rock. No part of this section, however, has been reported as containing a workable deposit of ore. In the next adjoining sections west, (10 and 11,) are deposits of ore on a scale of great magnitude ; they are, in fact, unrivalled in the abund-"], [331, "55 [4] ance and almost absolute purity of the ore. The purest ore occurs in a ridge, or elongated knob, which extends across the line between these two sections, about an eighth of a mile south of their northern boundary. It rises with precipitous walls to the height of at least fifty feet above the surrounding surface, and is made up of an almost chemically pure ore. It exhibits many of the characters of an igneous; eruptive rock, and cannot be regarded in any other light than as a huge lenticular mass, which has been elevated to its present position from beneath, while in a semi-fluid state, exactly in the same way as the trappean ridges which accompany it, and which it so strikingly resembles in general outline and position. The ores of this ridge, though in the highest degree of purity, differ somewhat in appearance at different points. The purest portions are a very compact and fine-grained specular ore, having an imperfect slaty structure, and traversed by joints, like the slates in the neighborhood. Through this fine-grained base are scattered numerous, minute crystals of the magnetic oxide. In other places, the ore is almost entirely made up of an aggregate of crystals of the magnetic oxide, sometimes very minute, and rarely larger than a pin's head. Abundance of ore may be obtained in loose blocks, around the base of the ridge, and of a quality unrivalled for purity, con taining between sixty-nine and seventy per cent, of metallic iron. (See analyses of ores from this locality.} The emanations of metallic matter have penetrated the adjoining slaty rocks in the vicinity of this locality, anil filled them with crystals or mag netic oxide and occasional streaks and bands of fine-grained peroxide of iron. The thickness of the mass described above, or its linear extent, can not be given with accuracy, as its limits are concealed bv the heavy cover ing of drift which extends over the greater rorticn of this region ; but it may be safely stateel that this single locality is capable of furnishing an in exhaustible supply of ore ; and that, too, without recourse being had to expensive underground mining. Farther south, we find another deposit of ore crossing the line between the same sections (10 and 11), on a scale of still greater magnitude, though not equal in point of purity, to the ore last describee! ; this is known as the Cleveland location. It rises in the form of an elongated knob, or ridge, to the height of one hundred and eighty feet above the small stream in the valley at its base, and one hundred and fifty-two feet above the drift ter race, over which the road passes near its northern slope. Its height above Lake Superior is 1033 feet, and it forms the culminating point en this line, between the two lakes. This mountain of ore, for such it may be called, is no less remarkable for its magnitude, than for its extraordinary structure. It is made up, as far as it is exposed on its sides, which rise irregularly, and in some places with vertical walls, of alternate bands of pure fine-grained peroxide of iron and of jaspery ore. The thickness of the bands varies from that of a sheet of paper up to one-fourth of an inch. They are not arranged in a constant position, with regard to thevgeneral disposition of the mass ; but are twisted and contorted in every variety of form and outline ; the curvatures are, however, mostly on a very small scale, the radius of cur* vature in the concentrically folded layers being never as great as one foot in length. The deep-red color of the jaspery portion contrasts admirably with the steel-gray of the less silicious bands; indeed, the singular beauty presented to the eye on stripping off the mossy covering of a vertical wall thus decorated by innumerable^ fantastically-interwoven, stripes of harmoti-"], [332, "[4] 56 zing and brilliant colors, can hardly be exaggerated. We kr.ow of nothing resembling it elsewhere. This peculiarity of structure, as well as the con- volutions, is represented in Plate XXI., Fig. 3. The width of this deposit of ore cannot be less, at its base, than a thou- sand feet, and it may be traced for considerably over a mile in length. It is probable that the deposit which occurs on the western line of this section, south of the trail, is a continuation of that just described. It appears in the form of a rounded knob, portions of which are cf very pure ore, while in other places, it exhibits the same banded stiucture as the more easterly- portion of the ridge. In the line of sections next south of 10, 11 and 12, namely, 13, 14 and 15, there is a large quantity of iron at numerous localities; but so far as we have examined them, they are much inferior in quality and purity to those just described. The metallic matter has apparently not been thrown up bodily in a fluid, or semi-fluid, state ; but has permeated the slaty, silicious rocks in the form of a sublimation from below, and is, therefore, not pure, being mixed with more or less foreign matter. At the south-eastern corner of section 13, the hornblende slate is' thus impregnated with iron, which occasionally forms in it streaks of quite pure ore, but not of any consider- able thickness. The same may be said of numerous localities along the line between sec- tions 13, 14 and 15, and sections 22, 23 and 24. In proportion, however. as we recede to the north, or south, of a band about -a mile in width, occupy- ing the northern portion of the township, we find the quantity and purity of the ore deteriorating. Township 48, Range 30. \u2014 On the northern shore of Machi-gummi, iron has been observed at several localities, but it possesses no great purity. It is associated with compact hornblende and feldspar rocks, which may be eruptive in their origin. In some instances, it occurs in slates, when it par- takes of the laminated structure characteristic of these deposits. In other instances, for example along the south boundary of section 32, township 48, range 30, it is associated with a rock in which quartz largely predomi- nates : an association very common in the Adirondack ores of New York. Township 46, Ranges 29 and 30. \u2014 The largest mass observed by us in this region occurs on the left bank of the Machi-g&mig, in section 7, of township 46, range 29, and traces of it are to be observed on several of the adjoining sections. It here rises in a nearly vertical cliff to the height of one hundred and thirteen feet, and is somewhat variable in purity. For the most part, it has a slaty cleavage, and, on close inspection, is observed to be composed of alternating bands of micaceous specular iron and quartz, tinged red by the peroxide of iron ; but there are occasional belts which display a granular texture, and apparently possess a greater degree of purity. These lamin\u00e6 are nearly vertical, exhibiting few contortions, and range with so much uniformity, that the observer would be inclined to refer both the slates and the iron to a common origin. Interlaminated with it, is a band of rock composed mainly of white, granular quartz, with traces of feldspar, through which are disseminated particles, as well as rounded masses, of specular iron. It is difficult to pronounce whether this is a conglomerate, or a breccia. Notwithstanding the immense development of this iron, it was found impossible to determine its relations to the surrounding rocks, a fact of much importance in judging of its igneous, tr metamorphic, origin. At several points, veins of pure white quartz weie"], [333, "[*\u25a0] 57 seen traversing the cliff, which contained iron glance, a form of this mineral which was no where noticed except in this association. In the vicinity of portage No. 4, and on the right bank of. the river, ac cording to Mr. Burt, the same kind of specular iron is seen in ledges twenty and fifty feet in height ; and another exposure of equal magnitude was noticed on the north boundary of township 46, range 29 ; but in both in stances, the associated rocks were npt recognized. On the north boundary of township 43, range 31, Mr. John Burt observed a bed of iron possessing a considerable degree of purity, but of inconsider able extent. Township 40, Range 30. \u2014 This, as far as known, is the most southern position of the iron, and of course nearest to the navigable waters of Lake Michigan. Its position, however, as will be seen, is far less favorable than that of the deposits in the vicinity of Lake Superior, and we do not, there fore, believe the iron will become of practical value, at least within a rea sonable time. According to Mr. Whittlesey's notes, the bed is exposed near the south-west corner of the township, at several points along the west side of a hill which is about one hundred feet in height ; its breadth is from one to two hundred feet, showing nothing but slaty iron ore on its summit for a distance of forty rods. The real extent of this de posit is concealed by heavy accumulations of drift and boulders along its base and on the summit of the ridge; but it probably extends eastward for a con siderable distance. The distance from this deposit to the Menomonee river is only two or three miles; this river would furnish \u00bbgreat amout of water power in the neighborhood of the ore, but is not navigable except for canoes\", which can be carried round the numerous falls by portages. The quality of the ore does not appear, from the specimens collected, to be very good., it being mixed with more than half its weight of silicious matter. The sur face of the township is so covered by burnt and fallen timber and a thick undergrowth of maple and poplar, that it is difficult to ascertain much with regard to the character of the subjacent rocks. Township 43, Rtnge 28. \u2014 In the south part of this township, on the line between sections 28 and 29, there is, according to Mr. Burt, a deposit of iron of considerable extent. It is at lepst a hundred feet in breadth, and extends probably three-fourths of a mile in a linear direction. The speci mens of the ore shew a very high degree of purity, as they contain but little silicious matter, and are a mixture of the peroxide and magnetic oxide, yielding from 63 to 68 per cent, of metallic iron. (See analysis.) The course of the bed is N. 80\u00b0 E. S. 80\u00b0 W., and the dip is 83\u00b0 to the north. This is probably the most valuable deposit of ore in the southern portion of the dis trict, thus far observed.

The ores of this portion of the district are generally much mixed with silicious matter, and far inferior to those of the deposits farther to the north-east. (See analysis.)"], [334, "[4] 58 OCCURRENCE OF IRON ORES IN OTHER DISTRICTS. Having thus briefly indicated some of the principal localities of iron in our district, and given an account of their association with the slates and trappean rocks of the azoic system ; for the purpose of enabling the reader to form a clearer idea of their probable origin, geological position, and mode of occurrence, we propose to allude to some of the most extensive and im portant deposits in other parts of the world ; excluding from our notice those ores which occur chiefly in the form of an impure carbonate, in the carboniferous series, and which are of such great importance frcm their immense development in connection with the coal. With these ores, these cf Lake Superior have no analogy, either in their mine ralogical composition, or their mgde of occurrence. It is to those greet deposits of the oxides of iron which occur in various parts of the world, that we are to look for the means of comparison. Among these, the best known and most extensive, in Europe, are those cf Sweden, of Elba and Russia ; and, in our own coun try, those of northern New Yoik, and Missouri. They are of great extent and cf remarkable purity. Mines of Scandinavia. \u2014 According to the best authorities, and especially Durocher, who has given a very detailed and careful description of the metalliferous deposits cf Scandinavia, the ores cf iren may be arranged in the following scheme. ! f <T.

The deposits of the first division are by far the most important ; these in the pal\u00e6ozoic rocks the least s6. It will be noticed particularly that the former are enclosed in the\" azoic series, which in Sweden and Norway is made up- principally of a crystalline, granitic gneiss, presenting an almost infinite succession of feldspathic, quartzose, micaceous and hornblende lami n\u00e6, and often cut through and disturbed by dykes of greenstone and granite. The researches of Murchison and de Verneuil show conclusively that these rocks had taken their present form before the deposition of the lowest Silurian strata. There are several localities where the magnetic oxide occurs nearly pure and without gangue ; of this, the mine of Bispberg fur nishes a good example. It has the form of a lenticular mass, and its longest axis coincides with the direction of the schistose structure of the slates in which it is enclosed. The mines of Danemora are in a ferriferous band of about 600 feet in width, and 7000 feet in length. In the neigh bourhood gneiss is the prevailing rock ; but, in the immediate proximity of the mines, the rock exposed is a greyish limestone, slightly magnesian, ac companied by talcose and chloritic slates, which probably are suborduiate"], [335, "59 [4] to the gneiss. The deposit* of iron form- imperfectly cylindrical masses, their axes almost vertical, and their bases much elongated in the direction of the schistose structure of the rock. The mines of Uto, which are especially interesting to the mineralogist on account of the quantity of lithia minerals which are found there, are of great importance. The ore is principally the specular oxide mixed with the magnetic oxide. It is in the form of lenticular masses, enclosed in micaceous slates and quartz-rock ; at the point of contact of the ferriferous mass, the quartzose beds predominate, and the silica is often colored red by the peroxide of iron. The principal deposit is about one hundred and twenty feet in its widest part, forming an enormous, lenticular mass of an irregular contour, and with a vertical axis. At Gellivara, the magnetic oxide forms a mountain mass three or four miles in length, and a mile and a half in width, a great portion of which is very pure, some portions containing specular ore mixed with magnetic. The principal reason why this enormous deposit has not been worked to a great extent, is its remoteness from navigable water, and its very high northern latitude, (67\u00b0). These deposits are called, in Sweden and Norway, veins; but they differ materially in character from what is generally understood by true veins. With a few exceptions, they appear to have been deposited in the midst of schistose, or missive rocks, in forms which approach mere nearly to beds, or elongated bands and irregular masses ; and they have evidently not filled previously-existing fissures which cross the strata at an angle, but almost unisorm'y coincide in the direction of their gre^te:t elongation with the strata of the schistose rocks. The micaceous, specular ores are generally associated with the quartzose and mica slates, but rarely with the calcareous rocks. Where there is cal careous matter near the junction of the ore and the enclosing rock, there is a great variety of minerals in the gangue, indicating that they were formed, under certain conditions, by the metamorphic action of the ferrifer rous mass upon the adjacent rocks. The mine of Hassel, in Norway, offers a good iastaase of thi tendency of the specular ore to associate itself with the quartzose and slaty rocks. The deposit is not a vein, but rather a series of slaty bed3 impregnated with peroxide of iron, to the amount of twenty or thirty per cent. The Mines of Elba. \u2014 The mines of Elba, which have been so long known as to have acquired a classic celebrity, afford abundant proof of the igneous origin of the specular ores of iron ; and, on that account, are of great iaterest to the geologist. The deposits cf iron are principally concentrate in the eastern part of the island, where they are associated with serpentine. The sedimentary rocks in that vicinity have been metamorphosed and intermingled with serpentine, so as to give rise to an abundance of beauti fully variegated marbles. The mass of specular ore near Rio has all the appearance of having been formed by sublimation, with pressure from below upwards, through the strata, which are highly metamorphosed at the con tact of the ferriferous mass and into which these metallic emanations have penetrated in every direction. The nature of the gangue varies with the rock in which it is contained. In the quartzose slates, it is mostly crystal lized quartz, and in the calcareous strata, actinolite and yenite ; \"so that it 13 evident that these effects could only have arisen from intense igneous action."], [336, "L4] 60 The appearance and relations of the mass of\u00abmagnetic oxide and heraa\u00ab tite of Monte Calamita, are such as to leave no doubt as to its igneous origin. This deposit, which is much more extensive than that of Rio, has uplifted the incumbent strata and produced all the effects of metamorphic action upon them. For instance, the compact limestone which lies adjacent to the ferriferous mass, is changed into a saccharoidal dolomite, end, along the line of contact, silicates of lime, magnesia anel iron have been devel oped. The whole appearance of the mass is, according to Eurat, that of an immense wedge driven upwards frem below into the calcareous and schis tose rocks, producing all the effects to be expected from the intrusion of such a mass by igneous agency. The age of the deposits of the island of Elba is probably later than the Jurassic epoch; but it must be observed that, although these mines have become very celebrated, from the great length of time during which they have been worked, yet the deposits are by no means on a scale of such magnitude as those of the azoic system, though highly interesting from the evidences of igneous action which they present. Russian Mines. \u2014 The iron ores of Nijny Taginsk, in the Ural moun tains, occur in immense masses, which are thus described by Murchison and de Verneuil, in their Geology of Russia. From this, it will be seen that the associated rocks of the two regions (Lake Superior and the Ural) are somewhat similar, though differing in age. \"On the summits and slopes of the Vissokaya-gora, patches of ore (usually compact, and with a conchoidal fracture,) have been extracted from a very remote period ;# but, whether these metallic masses are merely the upper portions of veins which traverse the surrounding rock, or mere adherent superficial patches, which occupy cavities and clefts in the green stone, we could not ascertain. However this may be, the chief mass of the ore is now seen to occupy the valley on the western side of the hill, for it has been deeply cut into by open quarries. The refuse stuff, or capping of decomposed feldspar and mixed matter, with hydrate of iron, having been cleared away, an enormous body of the iron ore, (fer oxydule,) rudely bedded, and traversed by numerous joints, is exposed by great works along a face which, including the useless overlying materials, has a height of nearly a hundred feet, and a length of several hundred. When on the spot, it seemed to us possible to account for the appearance presented by this metallic accumulation, most of which is now but little solidified, either by supposing it to have been of plutonic origin, and that, issuing from fissures on the hill-side, it had flowed, when in a molten state, into the hollow where it lies; or, that it was formerly a mass of sedi mentary materials, which had been altered and mineralized by heat and vapors, which, making use of parts of the surrounding limestone as a flux, had elaborated the metallic substance. A feature pointed out to us by M. Schwetzoff, may serve to throw some light on the question of the origin of the iron. In opening out the side of the valley, nearest to the hill of greenstone, irregular knobs, or points, of that rock were met with, on strip ping which, it was found that the iron ore had accommodated itself to the inequalities of the surface, and that, at such points of contact, the ore was *iot only harder and more crystalline than usual, \u2014in fact, almost unmanage able by the workmen\u2014but, also, much more magnetic than at a short dis tance from the greenstone. Now, if the observer were furnished with no other data than these, he"], [337, "t4] 61 might, reasoning from the countless analogies of metamorphism which result from the eruption of igneous through sedimentary matter, infer that the greenstone, intruding into ancient materials, had, in producing a change throughout their whole mass, rendered those parts only which were in con tact with it, most crystalline and metallic, by the development at such points of the most powerful electrical action. We leaned, we confess, when on the spot, to this opinion ; but, after having read the memoir of Colonel Helmersen, upon the origin of the magnetic iron ore of Blagodat, we are bound to admit, that the phenomena at Nijny Tagilsk may possibly be explicable in accordance with his views, and that the metallic iron ore may have penetrated the preexisting green stone of the hill, and thence have flowed, as submarine lava, or volcanic mud, into the contiguous depressions. The fact, that the ore expands in width, thickness and dimensions, as it is followed into the lower parts of the valley, and that it sills up the sinuosities of the subjacent rock, seem, on the whole, to favor this view.\"* At Blagodat, the chief eruptive rock is feldspathic augite porphyry. Up right masses with metallic surfaces are seen to rise out, as is were, from the porphyry, indicating the ancient quarries from which the iron ore has been extracted. When on the spot, we were rather disposed, they remark, to view the great lateral and rudely stratified accumulations as sediments which had been metamorphosed by the influence of the contiguous eruptive rocks; we were then ignorant of the tact, that dykes of really intrusive character, made up of crystalline and igneously-formed minerals, and clearly formed posterior to the mountain, contained similar iron ore. If we turn from the foreign localities of this class of deposits to those of our own country, we shall find that they possess many features in common, and that they were all derived, probably, from a common origin. Iron region of Missouri. \u2014 From Mr. Charles F. Mersch, an intelligent German metallurgist, who was employed for several years at the Iron moun tain of Missouri in superintending the erection of furnaces and directing their operation, we derive the following information: \"The specular and magnetic iron ores in this portion of Missouri are found in the porphyritic rocks which constitute all this part of the region. The Iron mountain proper is a conical hill at the western extremity of one' of these porphyritic ridges, its base covering an area of about three quarters of a square mile. Its height is very nearly two hundred feet above the surrounding plain, and its summit is an isolated cone; but on the eastern side, some thirty feet towards a narrow wall of porphyritic rock which con nects it with the ridge forming the western extremity, the junction of the iron ore and porphyry is very plainly seen, along the line of intersection of the surfaces of the two mountains. The specimens along that line contain the two rocks mechanically mixed. At a short distance on either side of this line, the iron ore and the porphyry are pure. This Iron mountain seems to consist of one single mass of compact oxide of iron, almost pure peroxide, with not more than two or three per cent. of silicious, or aluminous matter. Its top presents some large fragments, but without any indications of stratification. v This same specular ore is found in several places in other parts of the * Bwsia and the Ural Mountains, Vol. I., p. 871."], [338, "[4] 62 mountains, hut nowhere in such an extensive mass. It seems to form beds coeval with the porphyry which encloses it. .... Some four or five miles south of this iron mountain is situated another of a much laro-er size, known in the country as the Pilot knob. Here the ore, though not very different in its chemical composition, is different in its phy sical characters, and is known as the magnetic ore. Its altitude may be five or six hundred feet; its summit being about on the same level as the highest points of the porphyritic ridges. This, too, is an isolated cone, and the ore occurs from the summit to the base, appa rently farming an immense dyke bisecting the mountain, which is porphy ritic, like the surrounding ridges. This ore not only occurs in lamin\u00e6, like the slates, but varies also with regard to its purity \u2014 in general becoming more slaty as it becomes purer. When the impurities increase, the mass loses this slaty structure, and constitutes a rock similar in appearance to porphyry. As to the relation of this porphyritic formation to the granite, I can only add that, to my knowledge, there is no real black, or grey, granite in the country ; but about two or three miles to the south-west cf the Iron moun tain, commerces a very remarkable formation of sycr.itic granite, in boulder like masses, resembling in its external characters that of the Nile. These rest on dome-like formations of the same nature, with divided lines of stra tification, or division, running more or less parallel with the surface. As to the relative age of this formation and the porphyry, I have no facts to found an opinion upon. With regard to the sedimentary formations, the only ore I ever sew im mediately connected with the porphyry is a sandstone (Potsdam ?) which has been almost entirely destroyed by sulsequti t aquerus action; but which is posterior in age to the porphyry and iren ; sir.ee, wherever the leyeis ct the latter come in contact with the porphyry, they repese in a nearly hori zontal position \u2014 a fact the more important, since there are pcrtici.s of thil formation in other parts of the district, with different dips, produced in my opinion, by the action cf water. En resumi, I have never observed in the iren region of Missouri, ta which the preceding remarks refer, one single feature which wculd autho rize me to infer, or suspect, any volcanic or rlutonic acticn posterior to tht formation of the first sandstones, except such action as might have caused the absolute change of level in the whole country, of which there are abundant marks,.\" In a subsequent communication, in reply to additional queries prepeunded by us, he remarks : \u2014 \" With regard to the recks which mark the ictei section of the porphyry and iron ore, at the Iron mountain, they are really some what like breccias, though fused into a homogeneous mass ; one rock con taining fragments of the other, though less angular than is generally the case with breccias. My impression is that the specimens rather indicate that the porphyry contains fragments of iron, than the contrary : at any rate, I have never seen any which I would have considered as fragments of the twArocks merely cemented together. With regard to the direction of the ridges, I dare say but little about it, although my impressions are that they run, at least in the vicinity of the Iron mountain, north-east and soulh-west. There are some features about the Iron mountain which I did not com municate in my former letter ; but, in order that you may be able to deter-"], [339, "63 [4] tnine haw far the geological events of this region agree with those of Lake Superior, 1 add here a section of the Iron mountain. (Fig. 10.) This sec tion has actually been made, and there is, therefore, nothing theoretical, or rather, hypothetical, about it, except the relative thicknesses of the different masses.

In the nature of the ores and their mode of occurrence, as well as the character of the associated rocks, there is a considerable similarity to those of the Lake Superior district, but the analogy with the Swedish deposits is still more striking. The New York ores are chiefly the magnetic oxide, with some specular ore, or peroxide. They are included within gneiss, quartzose, and hypersthene rocks, and associated, not unfrequently, with ser pentine. The gneiss seems to be an obscurely stratified rock, similar in position to the azoic slates of the Lake Superior region, the upward range of the ores in both districts being limited by the Potsdam sandstone. By far the larger portion of both the magnetic and specular ores of the iron region of New York occurs in the form of masses, apparently due to igneous agency. These masses appear to be contemporaneous with the rock which encloses them, and, like the trappean rocks, they exhibit a jointed structure. The extent of many of these deposits is so great, that the ore can only be considered as a rock, and the deposits classed like greenstone, porphyry, or serpentine, among rock formations. These erup tive masses almost invariably coincide in their line of greatest linear develop ment, with the line of strike of the associated rocks, but are exceedingly irregular in their dimensions, expanding to a great width, and then con tracting again within very narrow limits, or disappearing for some distance"], [340, "[4] 64 entirely. Although thus coinciding in their strike, they do not invariably agree in dip, with the planes of the rpck enclosing them. Among the most extensive of these deposits, are those of the Adirondack mountains, which consist of the magnetic oxide, showing in their mode of occurrence a striking resemblance to the Swedish deposits before described, of the same class. Nothing like the appearance of regular veins is observed in them, except the small ramifications which are subordinate to the large masses. They have often a jointed structure, and break into tabular blocks. Some of them are slaty, having parallel lines of separation, a structure which may, with probability, be referred to the action of crystallizing forces. The width of these deposits seems to be very great in proportion to the length through which they have been traced. Thus, the \"Sanford bed,\" according to Dr. Emmons, is exposed for a length of 1667 feet, and its width is 514 feet. In describing these deposits, Dr. Emmons appears to have been satisfied of their igneous origin, and of their being by no means veins. In his descrip tion of the ores of Clinton county, however, he seems to recognize, in their mode of occurrence, all the phenomena of true veins,* in corroboration of which, he cites the celebrated \" Arnold vein. \" In our examination of this locality, we gave a different interpretation of the phenomena here displayed. So far from regarding the containing rock as granite, we thought we saw abundant evidences of its metamorphic ori gin. It does not appear in the form of a vast, irregular, compact mass; but presents well-defined lines, like those of bedding, having a uniform tlip and bearing. The ore is arranged in bands, consumable to these lines, and although it is slightly variable in thickness, it was not observed in any instance, to cross the mineral planes. It has none of the characters of a true vein. There are no well defined walls, grooved and striated \u2014 no distinct lines of separation between the metallic and silicious matter, and no gangue, different from the wall-rock : so far from it, there is a gradual pas sage from one into the other, and, even where there is the greatest con centration of the ore, we find disseminated particles of silicicus matter which do not differ in mineralogical character from the exterior rock. From the phenomena here displayed, most geologists would at once recog nize the deposit as a bed, and not a vein. It is true, this bed does not pur sue a uniform direction ; but when it is observed that the quartzose rocks are here traversed by powerful trappean dykes, we are not at loss to account for the dislocation. Ores of Massachusetts. \u2014 Canada East. \u2014 In Massachusetts, according to Professor Hitchcock, the micaceous oxide occurs in beds. At Hawley, it is included in the talcose slates, and at Chester, in the hornblende slates, inter stratified with talcose slates.t Mr. Logan has described numerous deposits of specular and magnetic oxide of iron, in the townships of Sutton and Brome,t Canada East, in a prolon gation of the Green Mountains. They occur between two dolomitic belts on the west side of the anticlinal axis, in a highly metamorphosed formation, supposed to be the equivalent of the Hudson-river group. He describes the deposits as beds, ranging and dipping with the associated strata. \" The * Report on the Second Geological District of New York. t Geologv of Massachusetts, 612. \u2022 } Report' of Progress, 1847-8, p. CO \u00ab \u00ab?."], [341, "[4] 65 ore of the whole of the localities that have been described is of a thinly laminated or slaty character, often splitting into curved plates where corru gations exist, and in the bluff in question the lamin\u00e6 throughout the whole face present a most complicated and fantastic set of contortions, but closely compacted together, in so smooth and polished a transverse section that it was not practicable to ascertain whether there was a tendency to separation in the lines of supposed deposit ; a few parallel joints, independent of these lines, were observed, but giving thick plates.\" These ores are more or less titaniferous, of a finely granular structure and contain an admixture of chlorite. There are, however, in this vicinity, transverse veins of nearly pure specular iron, with a quartzose gangue, cutting chlorite slates. THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS. Having thus indicated some of the most interesting localities of the ores of iron, analogous in their geological position and mode of occurrence to those of the Lake Superior district, we are naturally led to the considera tion of the theory of their origin : a question of the highest scientific in terest, with regard to which the opinions of eminent geologists are at va riance. These differences principally relate to the questions, I. Are they Veins, or Beds ? II. Are they of Igneous, or Metamorphic origin? To the consideration of these questions, wre propose to devote a few pages. I. These deposits, so far as investigated by us, display few of the pheno mena of veins. A vein we understand to be a fissure of indefinite length and depth, running, in most instances, across the lines of stratification, and filled with mineral or metallic matter, differing from the enclosing walls. The contents of a vein are generally separated from the walls on either side by selvages of decomposed earthy matter, so that the gangue and mineral matter are easily distinguished and detached from the accompanying rock ; moreover, there is generally evidence that the fissure is subsequent in age to the rock which it traverses. In all of these characteristics of a true vein, the great deposits of iron, whether observed on Lake Superior, in Missouri, New York, or Scandinavia, will be found to differ essen tially. We do net intend to imply that there may not be veins formed secondary to, and dependent on, the existence of larger masses. These appear in some of the deposits of the New York iron region in the form of ramifying and branching strings, shooting out from the great body of ore. So at the Jackson location, and on the Machi-gamig, -we have numerous quartz veins, secondary to the main ferriferous mass, into which the iron has been sub limed ; but it is worthy of remark, that in those veins, which never exceed an inch or two in width, the ore is in the form of brilliant plates, or proper specular ore associated with a quartzose gangue, which is not, the case in the main body at all. The great deposits of this metal, however, as we have seen, occur under conditions widely different. The Iron mountain of Missouri rises up from the surrounding plain like a great dome, or protuber ance, while the ferriferous belts of the Lake Superior district expand to the width of more than a thousand feet. In Scandinavia, they assume the form of flattened, cylindrical masses, and the same is true with regard to Ex.\u2014 3"], [342, "[4] 66 their occurrence in northern New York, their width, in some cases, being nearly as great as their extent. In regard to the junction of the ferriferous belt with the enclosing rocky masses, it may be said, in general, that there are no selvages and no abrupt lines of demarcation between the two ; but that they are, as it were, soldered together, or else the amount of metallic matter gradually decreases and is replaced by rock. In most of the Lake Superior deposits, there is a total absence of any appearance of selvages, and, moreover, there is no gangue, or peculiar mineral matter, connected with the ore. Where there is a ten dency to a parallel structure of the metalliferous belts, the bands of rock enclosed by them are in no way different in their nature from the formation itself in which the whole system is contained. Neither do we find any ap-* pearance of rubbed and polished surfaces, indicating a subsequent intrusion of the metallic mass, as if it had been driven in between the strata like a wedge. This is an important point, since we can hardly conceive of such enormous quantities of matter having been forced up from beneath, along the line of least resistance of the strata, without some evidence of such a powerful disruption of the rock, and of the immense friction of the uplifted mass against the rocky walls. The almost universally observed coincidence of the line of bearing, or line of greatest extent, with the lines of bedding of the adjacent rock formation, is another essential point of difference be tween the mode of occurrence of the iron deposits, and that of other ores occurring in regular veins. If there had been a set of previously existing fis sures, analogy with the metalliferous veins of the great mining districts would lead us to expect to find them, in the greater number of instances, crossing the formation at an angle with the line of direction of the strata. This is not the case with any of the deposits of ore in the Lake Superior region, and very rarely, if ever, in the other districts. We find, on the contrary, that the great iron beds of this region preserve in their direction a perfect harmony with the slates of the azoic series, which forbids the supposition of there ever having been a set of fissures formed by any disruption of the strata. Having thus shown that these deposits are essentially different from veins, we proceed to discuss the second branch of the enquiry. II. Are they of Igneous, or Metamorphic origin ? Or, in other words, have they been forced up through some widely expanding fissure and flowed over the ancient surface in broad sheets ; have they penetrated the prior formed strata in the form of metallic emanations from below ; or, were they originally deposited by aqueous causes, but subsequently modified by direct, or transmitted heat ? The occurrence in nature of specular and magnetic oxide of iron, and especially of the former variety, is such as to leave no doubt of its having been an original igneous product ; but, whether it is so, in all cases, can not, perhaps, be demonstrated. If, however, it appears, that this theory of its formation is analogous to what we know to be true, in many cases, and does not controvert any known fact, and that it is the only one by which the phenomena of these deposits can be explained, we should not hesitate to adopt ft. We know that the sublimation of speculai iron is a phenome non frequently exhibited, on a large scale, in volcanic craters. In that of Vesuvius, for instance, the clefts and cavities are often found lined with delicate and beautiful crystals of specular iron, deposited in such a manner as to leave no doubt of its having been sublimed from the seat of igneous"], [343, "[4] 67 action beneath. It is related, by Italian authors, that at the time of the eruption by which Torre de PAnnunziata was overwhelmed, numerous well defined crystals of this substance were gathered from the walls and doors of the convent. We consider that the evidence is sufficient, as shown in the preceding pages, to prove that the slates and quartzose rocks of the azoic period we\\e originally deposited from water, and that, since their deposition, they have undergone great changes in their structure. These belts, we have also shown, alternate throughout the iron region with undoubted igneous pro ducts, which, in all probability, were poured out during the accumulation of the sedimentary deposits, in lava-like sheets, over the bottom of the sea. Intercalated among these mixed products, we find the immense masses of ore, and to one or the other of these classes, we have no alternative but to refer their origin. In many districts, there is an intimate association between the iron masses and the trappean, porphyritic and serpentine rocks. The Iron mountain of Missouri occurs in connection with porphyry, without any vestiges of meta morphic rocks ; at Blagodat, upright masses, with metallic surfaces, are seen to rise out of the augitic porphyry ; at Monte Calamita, Elba, the iron mass has uplifted and metamorphosed the incumbent strata ; while, in the Lake Superior region, the trappean rocks very often, but not invariably, occur in close proximity to the great deposits of ore. On the other hand, the ores at Danemora are associated with metamorphic products, and the same is true, to some extent, of the specular ores of New York, Canada and Massachusetts. Were the trappean rocks found to be an invariable accompaniment of these deposits, there would be little hesitancy in assigning to all of them a purely eruptive origin ; but when we find them under the form of beds, in clearly metamorphic strata, having a common bearing and inclination, we are dis posed to regard them as having been derived from the destruction of pre viously-formed igneous masses, and their present association to have resulted from aqueous deposition. The azoic period having been one of long continued and violent mechan ical action, there is no reason to doubt that many of the strata of which it is composed may have been derived from the ruins of previously formed rocks of the same age, both sedimentary and igneous. This is clearly shown to be the case in the remarkable knob of conglomerate, described on page 43, which contains rounded fragments of the various kinds of ore found in the adjacent region. These ores in many districts, assume a banded structure. This is the case in the Lake Superior region, where we frequently find them interlaminated with jasper, chert, quartz and talcose slate. At the Pilot knob, in Missouri, they become lamellar as they increase in purity ; at the Sanford bed in the Adirondack, the same structure is displayed : and, at Nijny Tagilsk, they resemble a rudely stratified mass. At first glance, this banded structure might be regarded by some as the result of aqueous deposition, by which alternate seams of quartzose and ferru ginous matter were spread over each other, and the whole subsequently solidi fied and welded together by heat ; but, if we examine the circumstances more closely, it will be found more difficult to accouut for all of the facts, under this hypothesis, than might at first appear. The extreme tenuity of these bands, which are often no thicker than a sheet of paper, renders this supposi tion of their analogy to strata highly improbable. In fact, this banded"], [344, "[4] 68 structure in many of the Lake Superior ores\u2014 for example, at the Cleveland iron knob, will be hardly apparent to the eye, on fresh fracture of a speci men, the weathered surface of which may present a beautiful series of intri cate' convolutions of alternate bands of bright-red and steel-grey. Besides, i.n examining this mountain mass, we find every portion exhibiting equally nne and equally contorted series of convolutions. If these were reals) the result of aqueous deposition, we should expect, from analogy with other de posits of a similar character, that some of the layers would be of more con siderable thickness than others ; and that, supposing the contortions to have been caused by lateral pressure of the plastic mass, in some cases, at least, the foldings would exhibit a considerable radius of curvature, which is not the case here. We know of no theory which affords so probable an explanation of this structure, as that by which the action of segregating forces is brought into play. An analogous phenomenon may be seen both in the igneous and aqueous rocks of Keweenaw Point. Thus, (in Part I., p. 61), we have described a concretionary structure in the trappean rocks, resulting from this kind of action, by which a series of waving and differently colored bands have been formed. To a similar origin must be ascribed the parallel bands of red and white, with which the sandstone cliffs on the southern side of this point are ' ornamented, the direction of which is in no degree dependent on the stratification. (Part I., p. 115, and PI. XII., Fig. 1.) The jasper of the Porcupine mountains, in the western portion of the dis trict, exhibits a banded structure analogous to that of the ores in question. The flexures are exceedingly intricate, and bear no marks of having been the result of original stratification. There is no actual line of separation betwreen the lighter and darker bands, and if a specimen is struck with a hammer, it is found that it no more easily breaks in the direction of these bands than across them. > On the whole, we are disposed to regard the specular and magnetic oxide of iron as a purely igneous product, in some instances poured out, but in others sublimed, from the interior of the earth. The supposition, entertained by some, that it may be a secondary product, resulting from the decomposition of the pyritous ores, or from the metamorphism of bog iron, is inadequate to account for the accumulation of such mountain masses, or to explain its relations to the associated rocks. Where these ores occur in a state of almost absolute purity, in the form of vast, irregular masses, occupying preexisting depressions ; or, where the incumbent strata are metamorphosed anel folded over them ; or, where they are traversed by long lines of ferruginous matter in the form of dykes \u2014 there can be little doubt that these ores have risen up, in a plastic state, from below. Where they are found impregnatmg metamorphic products, such as jasper, hornstone, or chert, quartz, chlorite and talcose slate, not only interposed between the lamin\u00e6, but intimately incorporated with the mass, giving it a banded structure, we are disposed to regard it as the result of sublimation from the interior. Where they are included in metamorphic strata, in the form of beds, of variable width, with a conformable range and dip, and with minute par ticles of the associated rock mechanically mixed with the ore, we are dis posed to regard them as the result of aqueous deposition, although the materials may have been derived from the ruins of purely igneous products."], [345, "[4] 69 RESUME. We may conceive that the various rocks of the azoic series were originally deposited in a nearly horizontal position, at a period prior to the appearance of organic life upon the earth : that these stratified deposits were composed, for the most part, of finely comminuted materials, principally silicious and argillaceous, in some cases consisting of almost pure silex, like the purest portion of the Potsdam sandstone which was afterwards deposited upon these strata. During the deposition of these strata, at various intervals, sheets of plastic mineral matter were poured forth from below, and spread out upon the sur face of the preexisting strata. These igneous rocks are exceedingly compact and uniform in their texture, which would seem to indicate that they were under heavy pressure, probably at the bottom of a deep ocean. The same depth of water is also inferred from the comparative absence of ripple marked surfaces throughout the whole series. During this period, the interior of the earth was the source of constant emanations of iron, which appeared at the surface in the form of a plastic mass in combination with oxygen, or rose in metallic vapors, or as a sub limate, perhaps as a chloride ; in the one case, it covered over the surface like a lava sheet ; in the other, it was absorbed into the adjacent rocks, or diffused through the strata in the process of formation. Besides, a large amount of iron entered into the composition of the igneous rocks of this period, chiefly in combination with silica, as a silicate of the protoxide. Portions of the eruptive masses were occasionally subjected to denudation, and the ferruginous particles were, under the action of violent currents, spread out in thin beds, or swept into some depression of the surface, form ing a lenticular mass, upon which the strata were afterwards accumulated. When the silicious materials had become impregnated with metallic matter, which may have been scattered more or less uniformly through it, a rear rangement of the silicious and ferruginous particles in some instances took place, under the action of segregating forces, by which the whole mass as sumed a banded structure. Subsequently, the whole series of beds, slaty, quartzose, ferruginous and trappean, were elevated, and, in all probability, folded, perhaps at the epoch of the elevation of the granite ranges on the north and south of the ferri serous belt of the azoic system."], [346, "[4] 70 CHAPTER V.

Before entering on the subject proper of this chapter, we shall give the results of the analytical investigation of the ores of the azoic series, since their chemical composition is the first thing required to be known, before forming an opinion of their economical value. In the chemical examination of the ores of iron which occur within our district, we have endeavored, not simply to make our researches with suffi cient minuteness to be able to give the percentage of metallic iron which they contain,' but also to ascertain whether those foreign and accidental impurities, which usually accompany such ores, were present. This is an important question, since the quality of the iron manufactured from the ore depends, not only on the method employed in the fabrication, and the skill with which the metallurgic processes are performed, but also on the nature of the ore, and the kind and amount of impurities contained. In general, the method of analysis was as follows : The specimen to be analyzed was carefully pulverized, and dried at a temperature from 110\u00b0 to 120\u00b0 C. In this way, all the accidental moisture contained in the sub stance was entirely removed, and none of the ores examined were found to lose in weight, on being subjected to ignition, after having been thus dried; they do not, therefore, contain any water, in chemical combination. The dried substance was then transferred t-o a bulb-tube, and its weight being ascertained by weighing the tube before and after the introduction of the ore, it was then ignited in a stream of dry hydrogen gas. The oxygen was estimated by collecting the water formed in a chloride of calcium tube, and thus weighing it directly, or by determining the loss of weight of the tube, after the ignition. The latter was generally the method adopted, as, with all the precautions which could be taken, the collecting of the water and weighing it directly was found to give less accurate results. The substance, after the reduction, was attacked by weak chlorohydric acid, which dissolved out the metallic iron, and left undissolved the earthy, silicious portion of the ore. This was separated by filtration, ignited and weighed, and then, either fused with carbonate of soda and analyzed as a silicate, or qualitatively determined by the aid of the blowpipe. The filtered solution was then heated, anel a few drops of nitric acid added to peroxidize the iron, which was then precipitated by caustic ammonia. If the precipitate of peroxide of iron contained alumina, it was separated by"], [347, "[4] 71 treating with caustic potash. The precipitate of iron was carefully dried, ignited in a current of air, and weighed as the peroxide. The filtrate, from which the precipitate by ammonia had been separated, was evaporated to dryness, and ignited to expel the ammoniacal salts, when the nature of the remaining ingredients, which were present, if at all, only in minute quantity, could be determined. These were generally lime, magnesia, or manganese. In this way, having ascertained with accuracy the quantity of oxygen and of metallic iron, by calculation from the peroxide obtained, it is easy to determine the state of oxidation of the iron in the ore, \u2014 that is, the relative quantities of the peroxide, Fe2 0\u201e and of the magnetic oxide, Fe O Fe2 + 0:i. There are, however, other substances which very commonly occur in small quantities in ores of iron, and which have a great influence on the quality of the iron produced from them ; but these must be sought for by a special examination, and their presence or absence thus demonstrated. The most important of these substances are phosphorus, sulphur, titanic acid and manganese ; arsenic and copper are a frequent accompaniment of these ores, but generally in very minute quantity. The influence which these foreign substances, when present in the ore, have upon the quality of the iron manufactured from it, depends principally upon their relative quantity; but, in general, it may be said, that sulphur and phosphorus have an injurious effect on the iron, if the ore contain any considerable quantity of these substances ; a certain proportion of manganese, on the contrary, is generally considered to increase the value of the iron. It is generally conceded, that the best steel is not one which contains nothing but carbon and iron ; but that those varieties which unite the greatest amount of- hardness and tenacity, with the requisite malleability are such as contain minute portions of other substances. This is especially true of silicium and manganese ; of the former, the best steel may contain as much as .02 per cent. Some metallurgists even are of opinion that silicium is an essential ingredient of good steel. In regard to pig-iron, the qualities required in it depend on whether it is to be manufactured into bar-iron, or used for castings. In the former case, the amount of silicium or aluminium, present in the pig-iron, may easily be sufficiently reduced by puddling, while the sulphur and phosphorus are much less easily got rid of. For the manufacture of castings, it is neces sary that the iron should have a sufficient degree of fluidity when melted, and that it should be of a uniform texture, and sufficiently tenacious, when cold. Phosphorus renders the pig-iron fluid, when melted, and hard, but, at the same time, brittle, when cold. Sulphur gives a porous texture to the casting, and is generally injurious. The best methods of determining the presence of the above-mentioned impurities in an ore of iron, is as follows : To detect sulphur, the ore should be pulverized, and treated on char coal, with three times its volume of dry carbonate of soda, in the reducing flame of the blowpipe. The fused mass, aster cooling, is then removed from the charcoal with the forceps, and laid on a bright, polished surface of silver, and moistened with water. If the ore is perfectly free from sulphur no discoloration of the surface of the silver will be perceived on washing off the substance, after it has been allowed to remain upon it for a few minutes. If a trace of sulphur were present in the ore, it would be"], [348, "[4] 72 indicated by a brown stain of sulphuret of silver ; if the quantity of sul phur was more considerable, the stain would be more deeply and strongly colored. Of course, the absolute freedom of the carbonate of soda employed, from this impurity, must be ascertained before using it for this purpose. The presence of phosphorus is best ascertained in the following manner : A small quantity of the pulverized ore is mixed with aboutfive times its volume of a mixture of four parts, by weight, of carbonate of soda, and one of pure silica, and the whole fused in the oxidating flame of the blow pipe, on charcoal. The fused bead is then pulverized, and boiled with water, which dissolves the excess of carbonate of soda, and the greater portion of the silicate of soda, as well as the phosphate of soda formed in the operation, if phosphorus was present in the substance. The alkaline solution is then supersaturated with acetic acid, and thoroughly boiled, to expel all the carbonic acid. In the solution, after filtration, a small piece of nitrate of silver is placed, when the presence of phosphorus will be indicated, by a more or less intensely colored precipitate of yellow phos phate of silver around the spot where the nitrate of silver gradually dis solves. The presence of titanium may be best ascertained by the blowpipe, as follows : If the quantity of the substance is considerable, it will be made evident by heating a small portion on platina wire in the reducing flame of the blowpipe with salt of phosphorus. If titanium is present, the bead will acquire a deep brownish-red, or blood-red color. If the quantity is very minute, not over one per cent., the ore must be heated on charcoal, and after a thorough reduction, metallic tin must be added, when the pres ence of titanium will be indicated by the light-yellow color of the bead. If no titanium is present, the bead will have a greenish color. Manganese is almost universally present in ores of iron. If the quantity of this metal is not almost infinitesimally small, its presence will be easily detected on fusing a portion of the pulverized ore with a mixture of two parts of carbonate of soda and one of nitrate of potash, when a peculiar blue-green color, characteristic of manganese, will be observed. Although an exceedingly minute proportion of the metal may be detected in this way, there may be so slight a trace of it present, as to require a more elaborate process to render it manifest. In this case, the substance must be dissolved in chlorohydric acid, and the solution carefully neutralized by ammonia, and the oxide of iron precipitated by succinate of ammonia ; the filtrate is then to be evaporated to dryness, and ignited to expel the ammoniacal salts. If there is the minutest trace of manganese present in the ore, it will be made manifest by fusing the substance remaining after the ignition with soda and saltpetre. Arsenic may be detected, whether it be present in large or small quan tities, in the following manner : A small quantity of the ore, fifty to seventy-five milligrammes, is to be mixed with about six times its volume of a mixture of equal parts of soda and saltpetre. The whole is then heated in a platina spoon and the fused mass treated with boiling water, until alLthe soluble portion is taken up. The insoluble portion having been filtered off, the liquid is evaporated to dryness, after adding a few drops of sulphuric acid. The dry residuum is then to be pulverized with about three times its volume of oxalate of pot ash and a little coal dust, and the mixture heated to redness in a glass"], [349, "[<] 73 tube, sealed at one end, and drawn out to a small size at the other. If the smallest trace of arsenic was present in the ore, a ring of metallic arsenic will be sublimed and deposit itself upon the inside of the tube in brilliant crystals. If the part of the tube be then cut off and heated in the blow pipe flame, the odor of garlic peculiar to the arsenical fumes will be per ceived. ANALYSIS of ores. 1. Ore from the Jackson Company's Location \u2014 Township 47, Range 27, Section 1. \u2014 This is a massive, light-colored ore, with a highly crystalline structure, in which, under the microscope, numerous planes of the octohe dron may be seen. It is a mixture of the granular peroxide and the mag netic oxide, as will be seen from the analysis which follows : .9267 gramme gave, by reduction, .273 loss, oxygen, .0268 insoluble, and .9012 peroxide of iron _= .63084 iron. Oxygen 29.46 Iron 68.07 Insoluble 2.89 100.42 No trace of manganese, phosphorus or sulphur was detected. The insol uble portion consisted almost entirely of pure silica. 2. Slaty Ore from ike Jackson Company's Location \u2014 Township 47, Range 27, Section 1. \u2014 This is a very compact variety of the ore of this Company's location, and is somewhat slaty in its structure. It contains, here and there, a small amygdaloidal cavity, with a nodule of quartz. It is divided by regular joints, like the slates of the azoic system. The analysis shows it to be a very pure ore, being mainly the peroxide, with a little quartz intermixed. The results are : 1.0275 grammes, lost .2990 by reduction with hydro gen : gave .0169 insoluble residuum, consisting almost entirely of silica : 1.0142 peroxide of iron = .70994 metallic iron. Oxygen - 29.09 Iron 69.09 Insoluble 1.64 99.82 No trace of sulphur, or phosphorus, was detected in the specimen ex amined ; a slight trace of manganese was obtained. Both the specimens from this location show a high degree of purity and freedom from injurious substances, and an abundance of the ore may be ob tained of equal purity with that of the specimens analyzed. 3. Analysis of the very compact fine-grained Ore from the Marquette Company's Ore-bed\u2014 -Township 47 ', Range 27, Section 10.\u2014 This is a very compact and pure variety of ore, the body of which is fine-grained perox ide, in which numerous small crystals of the magnetic oxide are dissemi* nated."], [350, "[[4] 74 1.7450 grammes were attacked by chlorohydric acid. The solution was effected very slowly, although the substance had been finely pulverized. After an entire attack had been effected, there remained only .0032 of inso luble residuum ; = 0.20 per cent. The filtrate from the insoluble portion was supersaturated with ammonia and the precipitate of the peroxide of iron filtered off: it weighed 1.7507 = 1.2255 of metallic iron = 70.22 per cent. 1.4357 grammes reduced by hydrogen lost in weight .424 of oxygen __ 29.53 per cent. Iron \u25a0 70.22 Oxygen - - 29.53 Insoluble - 20 99.95 Or, Peroxide of iron 90.58 Magnetic Oxide - - \u2014 9.17 Silica 20 99.95 Thus it will be seen that this ore approaches very nearly to a chemically pure mixture of nine-tenths of peroxide and one-tenth of magnetic oxide. A great portion of the knob from which this specimen was taken is almost equally free from all foreign ingredients. 4. Iron Ore from the north-west Quarter of Section 10, Township 47, Range 27. \u2014 This is a beautiful variety of ore of great purity, consisting of a fine-grained mass, having a slaty structure, and being somewhat con torted, like many of the slates : throughout the whole mass are scattered innumerable crystals of magnetic iron, hardly more than one-fiftieth of an inch in diameter, which stand out in relief from the weathered surface of the specimens. I. 0.8213 gramme left .0094 residuum of silicious substance, and the remaining solution gave = .8174 of peroxide of iron. In the filtrate a trace of lime and magnesia was detected. II. .9412 gramme left .0107 residuum, which equals 1.13 per cent. : gave .9393 of peroxide of iron, which equals 99.79 per cent. I. II. Peroxide -of iron 99.52 99.79 Silicious substance 1.14 1.13 100.66 100.92 I. Gives 69.67 per cent, of metallic iron. II. Gives 69.85 of metallic iron. The ore is evidently a mixture of the peroxide with the magnetic oxide, is is shown by the results of the analysis, as well as by the appearance of the substance itself. Two determinations of the oxygen were made : in one, .8213 grammes"], [351, "[4] 75 lost .2217 of oxygen = 26.99 per cent. ; in the other, .9412 grammes lost .2556 of oxygen = 27.14 per cent : mean of the two 27.06. A portion of the iron is therefore in combination with the oxygen and the silica, as a silicate of iron, in such a manner as not to be reducible by hydrogen. Ore from the Iron Cascade \u2014 Township 47, Range 26, Sectional. \u2014 This is a good specimen of the ore occurring at this locality in very large quantity. The specimen analyzed was taken from (he immediate vicinity of the cascade, where the water pours over a ledge of the ore. It is a com pact, fine-grained mixture of quartz and specular iron, the former making up from 30 to 40 per cent, of the whole. 1.6138 grammes of the finely pulverized substance, digested for a long time with chlorohydric acid, left .5265 of a faintly reddish residuum, = 32.63 per cent. ; all the remaining portion of the substance was precipitated on the addition of ammonia, there being not a trace of residuum left, on evaporating and igniting the filtrate ; the precipitate of peroxide of iron, which contained a little alumina, weighed 1.0657. Peroxide of iron - - - 66.03 Insoluble 32.63 Water and loss 1.34 100.00 No trace of manganese, or sulphur was detected. The insoluble portion was analyzed by itself, as a silicate, by fusion with carbonate of soda. It contained : \u2014 Silica 95.85 Peroxide of iron , 2.88 Alumina, lime, and magnesia 1.27 100.00 The whole quantity of peroxide of iron in the substance is 66.96 percent., which gives 46.87 per cent, of metallic iron. The ore is mainly a mixture \u00b0f silica with peroxide of iron, with a little insoluble silicate of the pro toxi le of iron and alumina. Ore from the Machi-gamig \u2014 Township 46, Range 29, Section 6.\u2014 This is a beautiful specular ore, but contains nearly half its weight of silicious matter. The remainder is nearly pure peroxide of iron. 0.5978 gramme lost by reduction with hydrogen .0894 of oxygen = 14. 9;', per cent. : left insoluble substance, which was silica with a little alumina and a trace of iron, .2805 = 46.92 per cent. The precipitate of peroxide of iron weighed .3222 = .2255 metallic iron = 37.73 per cent. ]lon 37.73 Oxygen 14-95 fe\"\" \" 46.92 1 race of lime and magnesia 99.60 This ore contains a trace of manganese."], [352, "[ 4 ] -76 Ore from north Side of Section 4, Township 43, Range 31. \u2014 This ore was collected by Mr. John Burt. ' Like the other ores of this portion of the region, it contains a large amount of quartzose matter intermixed with it. . 0.525 grammes gave .2208 insoluble silicious residuum, _= 42.05 per cent. ; the precipitate of peroxide of iron weighed .3055, __ 58.09 per cent. Insoluble silica 42.05 Peroxide of iron 58.09 100.14 It contains about forty-two per cent, of metallic iron, with traces of lime, magnesia, and some alumina. It contains, also, a trace of manga nese. Ore from Township 42, Range 28, south on line between Sections 28 and 29, thirteen Chains. \u2014 This ore, collected by Mr. John Burt, is a quite pure and finely-granular variety, and considerably magnetic. It is a remarkably pure and valuable ore. 1.2801 grammes left .1297 insoluble silica, = 10.13 per cen.t. Another portion of the same specimen gave on 1.0775 grammes, a loss, by reduc tion, of .2844, = 26.40 per cent, of oxygen ; .9750 peroxide of iron, = .6825 metallic iron, = 63.34 per cent. Iron 63.34 Oxygen 26.40 Insoluble silica 10.13 99.87 This would give \u2014 Magnetic oxide 19.05 Peroxide of iron 70.69 Insoluble 10.13 99.87 Another specimen from the same locality, also collected by Mr. Burt, was analyzed. It differs, in external appearance from the last, in being less fine-grained, and in having less of a slaty structure. .9265 gramme gave .2573 oxygen, = 27.77 per cent., and left .0398 of silica unattached, = 4.29 per cent. The remainder was metallic iron. Oxygen 27.77 Iron (by loss) 67.94 Silica--' 4.29 100.00 This specimen contains less silica than the former, and more magnetic oxide, as is also evident by its action on the magnet. It is a very excellent ore, much superior to the larger portion of ores which occur in its neigh borhood."], [353, "[4] 77 Analysis of the jaspery Portion of the Ore from Township 47, Range 27, Section 10.\u2014 The bands of jasper and pure ore are so finely interlami nated, and have so little continuity, that it is difficult to separate the more silicious portion from that in which the peroxide predominates. , On sepa rating the former, as perfectly as possible from the latter, and subjecting it to an analysis, it was found to contain a considerable amount of iron. .4399 gramme was attacked by strong chlorohydric acid and repeatedly digested with it. There remained a large quantity of insoluble substance of a bright-red color, still containing a portion of iron which could not be taken up by boiling with strong acid. This residuum weighed .308 gramme. In the solution, ammonia gave a precipitate of .154 peroxide of iron. Peroxide of iron, dissolved by the acid 33.4 f Insoluble silica and iron 66.9 100.3 The insoluble substance was fused with carbonate of soda, and was found to consist of silica, colored by about two per cent, of oxide of iron. Silica - 98.3 Peroxide of iron \u2014 - 1.7 100.00 The substance is a mixture of silica colored by the peroxide of iron, and probably some silicate of the protoxide, with free or uncombined peroxide of iron. From the above analyses, it is evident that the purest ores occur in the northern part of township 47, range 27. Here, indeed, the specimens ana lyzed show an almost absolute purity anel freedom from foreign ingredients. The principal part of the insoluble matter left by acting on the ores with acids, is silica ; none of them contain more than a very minute quantity of alumina, lime, or magnesia. In most of the ores, the larger portion, by far, of the iron exists in the state of peroxide, though nearly all contain a small per centage of the magnetic oxide. Generally, the silica seems to be me chanically mixed with the oxides of iron, since the whole of the oxygen is obtained by reduction in hydrogen. In a few instances, however, from one to two per cent, of the oxygen is in combination with the iron and silica, in the form of an irreducible silicate. As far as the presence of injurious substances, such as sulphur, phospho rus and arsenic, is concerned, all the specimens examined are entirely, or almost entirely, free from them. A few specimens contain traces of sulphur, but not in sufficient quantity to have any perceptible effect on the quality of the iron manufactured. Manganese is present only in the most minute traces ; in fact, it can only be detected in most of them, by the most delicate and careful examination. METALLURGY OF THE IRON ORES. The iron ores described in the foregoing pages will be found capable of producing a soft, malleable iron. With proper care in its manufacture, it may be converted into steel, adapted to the finer varieties of cutlery. The silex, so intimately incorporated with the mass, will serve as a flux, and ren-"], [354, "[4] .78 4er the reduction of the ores easy, particularly where the fusion takes place in the furnace. Ores of almost any degree of purity can be obtained, but the richest are, by no means, the most easily reduced in the blast furnace. The specular ores of New York are found to contain more or less bisul phuret of iron (iron pyrites), which impairs their value, as it is not wholly expelled by roasting. In some instances, too, they are associated with titanium, which render them exceedingly refractory in the furnace. Neither of these substances have we been able to detect, in sufficient quantity to pro duce any perceptible effect, in the ores of Lake Superior. Notwithstanding the immense amount of iron produced in Great Britain, none of it, with the exception of the Ulverstone charcoal iron, is capable ol conversion into the finer varieties of steel. The Swedish hoop L, the Indian wootz and the Russia irons occupy the highest rank. The famous Indian wootz-ore consists of magnetic oxide of iron united with a large proportion of quartz, the compound consisting of 42 silex, and 58 magnetic oxide of iron. The natives pound the ore and winnow away the earthy particles. With a clay furnace, four or five feet high \u2014 the work of a few hours \u2014 and with a blast supplied by a bellows made of a goat skin with a bamboo nozzle, plied by the hands, for three or four hours, the Hindoo brings out his bloom. * A pound or two of this iron is enclosed in a clay crucible, with small fragments of dry wood, the whole being covered with a few green leaves. The orifice is then closed with clay, and the crucibles are subjected to a heat for about two hours, in a blast furnace, when the process is considered to be complete. In this rude way is pro duced a steel, eminently adapted to the purposes of fine cutlery. For the reduction of these ores, the several companies have introduced the Catalan forge, so extensively employed in the Lake Champlain region of New York. This has been done for two reasons : first, it requires a small outlay of capital ; and second, it avoids the uncertainty incident to working a new ore with success in a blast furnace. Besides, according to Mr. Alger, who has had a large amount of experience in the iron manufac ture, these ores are better adapted to the production of malleable, than of cast iron. They do not so readily unite with carbon to produce that grey, soft condition which is found in the superior cast iron made from the he matitic and clay iron ores ; and they require much greater heat for their reduction and perfect metallization. An inferior article of pig-metal will not bear transportation to a remote market, whereas a superior article of bar-iron may be profitably sent to any market in the country. The forges are represented in plate XXII, which is copied from the American Railroad Journal, for September 1849, illustrating one of a series of valuable articles on the Iron manufactures of the United States, by Mr. James T. Hodge. \" The first four figures represent sections in different directions through the simplest form of the bloomery.

Hence only the hematites and the specular and magnetic ores are adapted to this kind of forge. Although there is but one fusion, the ores undergo two successive changes. 1st. The deoxydizement and reduction of the metal by bringing it in con tact with charcoal. 2d. The melting and aggregation of the metal in a ball fit for the squeezer. The following is the method of treatment pursued in the reduction of these ores. The ore is introduced into the top of the forge, in alternating charges with charcoal, in a state of great mechanical subdivision, resembling coarse sand, having been previously calcined, stamped and washed, if it contain much earthy matter. The supply of fuel is maintained in the first stages of the process so as to keep the space full and prevent the ore from collecting together. Water is occasionally sprinkled over the surface, which prevents the fine siftings from being blown away, and gives increased fusibility to the scoriae. The ore falls down and the melted iron collects in a mass at the bottom of the hearth, while the thin slags run off by an upper overflow. | The mass is removed about every hour, in a pasty condition, by means of a powerful pair of tongs \u2014 working by an iron wheel on a railway suspended from the beams above \u2014 which seizes it firmly and conveys it to an anvil, where an iron lever, called a squeezer, working up and down, kneads the particles of iron together, forcing out the semi-fluid cinders and fashioning the loup for the rollers, to which it is transferred. The substitution of drawing cylinders in the place of trip-hammers has greatly facilitated the manufacture of bar iron. It accomplishes in a few minutes, the condensation of the particles, and the distribution of the fibres, which formerly was attained only after repeated heats and hammerings. In cylinder drawing, one workman holds the loup in a pair of tongs and passes it into the first of the grooves ; another workman, on the other side, receives it and passes it back to the first, \"who passes it into a second a&d"], [360, "[4] 80 smaller set, and so on, until it is reduced to a bar, three or four inches broad and two in' thickness. This is then cut by powerful shears, into short lengths called blooms, which are afterwards subjected to a refining process. So great is the dexterity displayed in these various processes, and so ad- mirable the adaptation of the machinery, that the rude ball as it comes from the forge, is converted into mill-bar iron, before it has had time to cool. The whole operation is accomplished in a little more than a minute. The bars are next subjected to the refining process, which consists in heat- ing them in the oven above described, and bringing them to a welding heat, which is accomplished in the course of one half or three quarters of an hour. Where great tenacity is required, they are re-heated and rolled. From the oven, they are passed to the extension rollers where they are fashioned into the required form, whether round, square, oval, or rectangular. Tenacity of the Lake. Superior Iron. \u2014 From the total absence of foreign ingredients, as indicated by the analysis, it would be inferred that these ores, if skilfully wrought, would produce an iron of great ductility and tenacity. In the summer of 1849, we placed two samples of this iron, selected, without any great care, from among the products of the Jackson forge, in the hands of Major Wade, of the Ordnance department \u2014 whose office it is to test the tenacity of the guns made for the government \u2014 for the purpose of experiment. The results obtained were as follows : Sample No. 1, 7.550 density, 89582 lbs. pressure to the square inch. Sample No. 2, 7.768 \u00ab 72885 \" In the second sample there was a slight flaw observed, after it was parted, which would account for its inferior tenacity. These results give an unparalleled tenacity, and prove the high value of this iron. During the past season, howrever, we received additional samples, made from the same ore, but by a different iron-master, which wTere placed in the possession of Mr. J. T. Ames, for experiment. The results were as follows : No. 1, welded three-ply, 56546 lbs. pressure to the square inch. \" 2, welded 55017 \" \" \" 3, without welding, 58583 \" \" \" The second set of experiments proves that the iron experimented on, was of a very ordinary quality ; and, when we compare its tenacity with that before tried, it is very evident that it has not been properly fabricated. Nothing is more uncertain than the quality of iron, however good the ore, where it is not skilfully and systematically wrought. To show the comparative quality of this iron, we give the results of the numerous experiments of Professor Walt,er R. Johnson, on the tenacity of bar-iron, from localities both at home and abroad : Strength in lbs. per square inch.

M. Everett, the former agent of the Jackson company. It will proba bly be found to require some modification : Digging and transporting the ore to the forge, two tons of which are required to produce a ton of blooms $ 3 00 Roasting the ore (2 tons) at $1 00 per ton 2 00 200 bushels of charcoal at 5c. per bushel 10 00 Incidental : 2 bloomers at $2 75 per day each, ) f Qd 2 firemen at 0 90 \" \" \\ J* Stocking furnace at $1 15 1 15 Costing, at that rate, per ton 6 74 Cost per ton, at the forge, of 2400 lbs. of iron in blooms $21 74 To this estimate should be added the interest on the capital, say $20,000, wear and tear of machinery, expense of agency, anel incidental expenses. The cost of transportation to the lake shore (nine miles) is $4 00 per ton, to Cleveland $5 00, thence to Pittsburgh $2 00 = $11 00. It ought to be added, that this company have water-power sufficient to drive eight forges, whereas they now employ but two. The expenses of agency and the interest on the capital would be no greater if the whole power were employed. Besides, as the country becomes settled, there will be a reduction in wages, and the facilities for transportation will be increased. It now costs nearly as much to transport a ton of ore nine miles, by land, as it does to send it nine hundred by water. The nearest proximity of these ores to the lake shore, as we have before stated \u2014 for example, those of the Iron cascade \u2014 is about twelve miles ; those of the Jackson and Cleveland locations are a little farther removed, while those on the borders of the Machi-gamig are thirty miles \u2014 being about equi- distant between the head of Keweenaw bay and the mouth of Carp river ; but the outlet at the latter point would be preferable. Those on the Me- nomonee are about fifty miles distant from Bay des Noquets on Lake Michi- gan, being as remote from that point as the beds on the Machi-gamig and the sources of the Carp. The beds of a similar character, in Dr. Owen's district, on the waters of Bad river, opposite La Pointe, explored by Mr. Whittlesey, are distant from the lake eighteen and twenty-two miles. We have thus endeavored to give all the information in our possession, with regard to the range and extent of these ores, the relative distances of the beds from navigable water, the physical features of the country which favor or impede their exploitation, the chemical composition of the ore, the best method of working them, the tenacity of the manufactured article, and the cost of production. From these data, business men can form correct conclusions whether the time has arrived for their profitable exploitation. Nothing would give so great an impetus to this region, or tend so much to the rapid development of its resources, as the opening of a ship-canal be- tween Lake Superior and Lake Huron. It is emphatically demanded by the mining interest ; and the moment it is done, the value of the public domain is enhanced ten-fold beyond the cost of its construction. Occurrence of other Ores. \u2014 This class of rocks, over many portions of the earth, has been found to be the repository of the rarer and more valu- able metals, such as gold, silver, tin, &c. Between this district and the"], [362, "[4] 82 Ural, there are many points of resemblance ; but Sir Roderick Murchison has shown, that the impregnation of those rocks with gold took place at a comparatively recent date, as recent as the drift epoch ; while, in this district, the metallic emanations ceased before the commencement of the Silurian epoch. It also presents many analogies with Cornwall ; but, thus far, the results of our explorations have led us to believe, that, aside from iron, the metallic products will prove of little value. We have not seen a single regular, well-defined vein of any extent, with distinct wall-rocks and gangues differing from the enclosing mass. There are fissures and irregular rents which contain metallic products, such as copper and iron pyrites, magnetic oxide of iron, &c; but they differ from productive lodes in their want of continuity anel parallelism. At the Pemenee falls, small veins of quartz, associated with brown oxide of iron are seen in the trappean rocks, having the appearance of an auriferous gangue. We regret that the specimens procured by us in 1848, were forwarded to Washington by our predecessor, without analysis. We do not assert that the rarer metals may not be found; but, thus far, all of the explorations south of the trap range of Keweenaw Point, not only in this district, but in the Chippewa district, have not re vealed their existence. At Presqu'isle, there is a vein seen by the lake shore, bearing nearly north and south, and dipping 75\u00b0 to the east. It is included in a rock which exhibits some traces of stratisicationj 'and may be likened to a volcanic sand. The New York and Lake Superior company, a few years ago, sank a shaft upon it to the depth of forty-five feet. At the surface, it yielded the sulphurets of copper anel iron, galena, and black oxide of manganese, enclosed in a matrix of chlorite, calc-spar anel quartz ; but, a short distance below, the more valuable metals disappeared, and iron pyrites was the only metallic product. Another vein was observed on the south-west quarter of section 27, township 48, range 26, containing copper pyrites in a gangue of quartz. It was explored to some extent, a few yeai's since, by the New York and Michigan company, but they met with few inducements to persevere. Narrow seams of sulphuret of copper are also seen in the quartz rocks, below Carp river. In the banks of a small stream flowing into the Machi-gamig, about ten miles below the outlet of Machi-gummi, galena was discovered by Mr. Crebbesa, in 1846 ; but we have not examined the locality, and have no information as to its economical value. On the Menomonee river, traces of the sulphuret of copper are abun dant ; but the veins are not concentrated. At the upper of the Twin falls, there are seams of quartz, included in chlorite slate, which contain traces of this ore. Veins were also observed at the foot of Little Bekuenesec and Sturgeon falls. OTHER ECONOMIC MATERIALS. Building Materials. \u2014 The granite of the Huron islands would afford a beautiful and durable material for construction. The islands are, in every respect, accessible, and we know not why they may noV: soon be resorted to for the purpose of procuring blocks."], [363, "[4| 83 As we have described the situation of these islands and the character of the rocks, in Chapter III., a farther notice is deemed unnecessary. Roofing Slates. \u2014 In so vast a body of slates as are here displayed, it would be surprising if numerous quarries suitable for roofing purposes were not discovered ; but on the surface they have been so acted on by atmos pheric agencies, that it is difficult to eletermine their true character. By jong exposure, they lose the property of cleaving into lamin\u00e6. This is so well understood by the block-hewers in slate quarries, that they never raise more blocks than the splitters can cleave in a short period of time. A frost partially restores this property, but repeated freezings and thawings destroy it altogether. The beds at (lie foot of little Bekuenesec falls, and near the Twin falls, on the Menomonee river, will probably yield unlimited supplies. Steatite and Serpentine. \u2014 From the character of the rocks, beds of these materials will undoubtedly be found in great abundance, but we are unable to indicate any localities worthy of exploration. The beds near Sturgeon falls, on the Menomonee, afford the best indications of any that have fallen under our observation. Fire-stones. \u2014 The talcose slates, as a general thing, are little affected by fire. The divisional planes intersect them in such a manner as to produce cuboidal blocks. These haye been employed in the construction of forges at the Jackson works, and answer a good purpose. Hones. \u2014 Portions of these slates take into their composition minute par ticles of quartz, forming novaculite. The beds at L'Anse afford very good whetstones, but they are too coarse to produce a fine edge on razors, surgi cal instruments, &c. The novaculite, however, of Carp river, is superior to any article which has fallen under our notice, not excepting the Arkansas, Turkey, or Scotch stone, for producing fineness of edge. Engravers will find these hones almost invaluable. The coarser materials for scythe-stones are abundantly distributed. Fire-brick. \u2014 The light-drab and plumose talc-slates, described as occur ring near Chippewa island, on the Menomonee river, if ground and kneaded, would make an admirable article of fire-brick. Lime. \u2014 The marbles described as occurring in the vicinity of Carp river and the Menomonee river, may be calcined into lime. The amount of magnesia which enters into their composition, does not seem to impair their value ; but the lime will not bear the addition of as much sand as an article made from a purer limestone. Ornamental Materials. \u2014 The limestones described as occurring near Carp river, and on the Machi-gamig and Menomonee, afford beautiful mar bles. The prevailing color is light-pink, traversed by veins 01 seams of deep-red. Others are blue and dove-colored, beautifully veined- They are susceptible of a fine polish, and blocks of any size may be procured. For tables, jambs, and vases, they would rival, in beauty, the most cele brated foreign products. Employed for external ornaments, the carved lines would withstand the vicissitudes of our variable climate, and remain sharp for centuries. These rocks, in place, exhibit angular surfaces, which, after all, is the best test of their durability. Fragments of pure-white saccharoidal marble, suitable for statuary, have been found upon the surface, but the beds from which they were derived have not been discovered. Some of the jaspers might be employed by the laoidary, for the smaller"], [364, "[4] 84 ornaments, but they have not been found in large masses, like those of the Ural. The dark and close-grained basalts, and the porphyries, with a dark-green base of hornblende and bright-red crystals of feldspar, observed on the Menomonee, if wrought into vases and boxes, would rival those of Egypt. Many of these materials will, sooner or later, be employed for the pur poses of construction and ornament."], [365, "85 [4] CHAPTER VI. COMPOSITION OF THE TRAPPEAN ROCKS. The Terms Trap and Trappean Rock generic. \u2014 Varieties of Rock which have been included under that Name. \u2014 Their Mineralogical Composi- tion. \u2014 Importance of these Rocks in our District. \u2014 Trappean Rocks associated with the Potsdam Sandstone. \u2014 Analyses. \u2014 Probable Analogy with Dolerite and Anamesite. \u2014 Occurrence of them in Beds. \u2014 Trap- pean Rocks of the Azoic System. \u2014 Analyses. \u2014 General Remarks- . The term trap, or trappean rock, has been applied in so general a man ner, and made to cover such an extensive group of mineral compounds, differing widely from each other in their external characters and minera logical composition, that great confusion has arisen in the designation of the igneous rocks. If we examine more closely what rocks have been desig nated under the name of trap, and endeavor to classify them, we find great difficulty, inasmuch as our knowledge of the mineralogical composition of many of them still remains in an imperfect state ; although much has been done, within the last few years, to throw light on this subject, and numerous chemists, among whom we might especially mention Delesse, Durocher, Abich, G. Rose, Cordier, and Bergemann, have devoted them selves to this Ions; and difficult task. It is with the intention of adding our contribution to this branch of geological science, that we have, as far as our time permitted, made a chemical investigation of a few of the varieties of the igneous rocks of our district. Not only has the term trap been applied to a great variety of rocks, but that of greenstone is hardly less extensively used, both in this country and in England, as well as on the continent. However much confusion the use of these two names may have caused, they will hardly be dropped, at least not until the nature of our igneous rocks shall have been thoroughly studied out, so that they can be arranged under systematic and fitting names. On the continent, we find that by far the larger portion of the igneous rocks embraced uneler the name of greenstone, are made up principally of labra dorite (or oligoclase) and pyroxene, in addition to which chlorite is often present. To this variety of rock the name of diabase is given by continental geologists. The term melaphyre, which includes many of the rocks known under the name of trap, is defined to be a fine-grained compound of labr? dorite and titaniferous magnetic iron, and probably pyroxene, together with, in many instances, carbonate of the protoxide of iron and carbonate of lime. The absence of quartz, as an essential ingredient of these rocks, both dia base and melaphyre, is a characteristic and important point. Under the name of basalt, or basaltic trap, are included dolerite, a crystalline aggre gate of labradorite, augite and titaniferous iron ; and anamesite, a homogeneous and very fine-grained mixture of the same minerals, the labradorite gene rally predominating. This latter term includes especially the rocks of northern Europe and Iceland. Basalt proper includes the rocks which contain, in addition to labradorite augite, and magnetic iron, a small amount"], [366, "[4] 86 of a zeolitic mineral, which gelatinizes in acids, and also, in many cases, olivine. In England, we find the terms greenstone and trap used indiscriminately to indicate rocks mostly of a fine-grained and compact nature, made up chiefly of feldspar and hornblende; \u2014 no distinction being made between the different varieties of the feldspar family, or between hornblende and pyroxene, or augite. In fact, we have only two great classes of igneous rocks recognized ; \u2014 granitic, or hypogene rocks as they are sometimes called, and trappean rocks ; the great and essential distinction between these two classes being the presence of quartz, as a distinct ingredient in the granitic rocks ; while, in the trappean, the silicious matter is all in combina tion with the bases alumina, lime, protoxide of iron, soda and potash, form ing minerals of the feldspar and hornblende families. If the rock has a columnar structure, it is called basalt, without regard to its mineralogical composition. In this country, the same confusion has prevailed, and all the dark-colored, fine-grained igneous rocks have been called greenstone, trap, or greenstone trap indiscriminately, without any attempt having been made to arrive at a knowledge of their composition, regard being chiefly had to their differ ences of external form, such as their having a columnar, or amygdaloidal structure. No attempt has been made, as far as we know, to separate, or classify, the numerous varieties included under those general and generic terms. We find, in all the writings of American geologists, that the term \" trap \" is used in a generic sense, and that it is defined to be a rock composed of feldspar and hornblende and ; we are not aware that any further attempts have been made, in this country, to investigate the mineralogical composition of this great and widely-extended class of rocks. The great importance of the trappean rocks in^iir district, from their in timate association with the veins of copper in the lower Silurian, and their connection with the deposits of iron in the azoic system, has made it incum bent upon us to devote some attention to their mineralogical composition ; and, though lack of time has rendered it impossible for us to carry out our researches very fully, yet we trust that, having made a beginning, we shall, ourselves, at some future time, be enabled to extend our labors still farther, or that the attention of others will be called to this important subject. The mere fact that we find the veins of copper, which are productive and rich in metallic contents in one band of rock, becoming worthless when passing into another, is sufficient proof of the scientific importance and practical value of such an investigation. TRAPPEAN ROCKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE POTSDAM SANDSTONE. We hardly find, in any part of the world, so great a variety of mineralo gical composition and external structure among the trappean rocks, as is exhibited by those trappean rocks which occur in the sandstone and conglo merates between the extremity of Keweenaw Point and the Montreal river, and on Isle Royale. In Part I, of this report, we have given some account of the different varieties of trappean rocks which occur in the copper-region, particularly"], [367, "87 [4]] with reference to their external characters, and we now proceed to the dis- cussion of their mineralogical and chemical composition. The principal mineral ingredients, so far as we can determine, which form the different varieties of trappean rocks of this region, are labrador feld- spar, (labradorite) hornblende, pyroxene, magnetic iron, chlorite, and epi- dote. These minerals, associated in ever-varying proportions, make up the great mass of the rocks, while the less widely diffused minerals are the \u25a0 zeolites, especially Laumonite, quartz, calc-spar and iron pyrites. The prevailing characteristic of these rocks is, that the mixture of the minerals which compose them is so intimate, and the whole mass is so com- pact and homogeneous in its texture, that the several component parts can- not be recognized by the eye, unless in exceptional cases, and of course it is impossible to isolate and analyze each by itself. In such a case, the only way to arrive at a knowledge of the mineralogical composition of the rock is to analyze it as a whole, and endeavor to ascertain by calculation, in what manner the different substances are grouped together into mineral compounds ; or if minerals which are soluble hi acid, are combined with such as are insoluble, to separate them in this way, and then to analyze the soluble and insoluble portions. We now proceed to give the results of some of our examinations of the compact homogeneous rocks, after which we will describe those in which distinct mineral compounds can be recognized by the eye, and then compare the general results with each other. Solubility of the Rocks in Acids. \u2014 A specimen from the wall of Shaw's vein, on Isle Royale, was finely pulverized, thoroughly dried at 110\u00b0 C, and ignited. It lost on 3.203 grammes .072 = 2.2 per cent. After long digestion, at a temperature of about 80\u00b0 C, with nitric acid (specific gravity 1.12), it was found that 26.95 per cent, of the whole was taken up, leaving 73.05 insoluble matter of a brick-red color. Chlorohydric acid dissolved on 2.2993 grammes, after long digestion, at about the same temperature as before, .7803, leaving 1.519 insoluble ; ot the insoluble portion .5552 was silica separated in a state in which it was taken up by carbonate of soda ; making for the soluble portion, including the separated silica, 58.09 per cent. The solution was tested for copper, but no trace of this metal was found ; it contained a very considerable pro- portion of peroxide of iron. Analysis of Greenstone from the summit of the cliff, at the Cliff Mine. \u2014 The following were the results of the examination of the greenstone from the summit of the ridge at the Cliff mine. This is a crystalline variety, I very tough, and breaking with an uneven fracture. It is of a dark-greenish color, very compact and homogeneous in its structure, but, when examined with the microscope, three distinct minerals can be recognized ; one is nearly colorless, or slightly tinged wdth green, and appears to be feldspathic ; the other is of a dark-green color, and resembles chlorite, while the third is apparently pyroxene or hornblende. Occasional crystals of magnetic iron occur, and can be made evident by pulverizing the substance anel applying the magnet. The pulverized substance, dried at 100\u00b0 C, lost, by ignition, on 2.114 grammes, .0374=1.74 per cent, of water ; chlorohydric acid (1.13 specific gravity), by long digestion, at a temperature near boiling, dissolved 21,17"], [368, "[4] 88 per cent., leaving 78.83 of silica and insoluble substance. Each portion was analyzed by itself, and the results were : Soluble. Insoluble. Silica 64.58 (by loss) Alumina 30.95 11.67 Protoxide of iron 32.47 9.18 Manganese - trace trace Lime 9.36 4.57 Magnesia--. 15.98 6.86 Soda 11.26 3.14 100.04 100.00 Analysis as a whole : Oxygen.

Like the preceding ore, it appears to be highly unfa vorable to the development of the copper-bearing veins. 1.9444 grammes of the finely-pulverized and dried substance, lost by ig nition .0479=2.46 per cent. The analysis of the dried material gave : Oxygen. Silica 47.97 24^3 Alumina 15.56 7.28 Protoxide of iron 12.41 2.75 1 Lime 7.07 2.02 1 Q ,Q Magnesia 8.2S 3.21 s J,oy Soda 6.24 1.61 J Water 2.46 2.18 99.99 The near agreement in the chemical composition of these two rocks will be apparent. If we proceed to consider, from the results of the above analysis, what is the probable mineralogical composition of the rock, we are obliged to con fess that the problem is not an easy one. In the first place, as to the nature of the feldspathic ingredient, which is the most important clue to this ques tion. The feldspathic portion of the trappean rocks, though it occurs in"], [369, "89 [4] distinct crystals, at various localities in the trappean region, both on Isle Royale anil Keweenaw Point, is never found in crystals of sufficiently large size to allow them to be separated from the rock and analyzed by themselves. This is unfortunate, since, at the present time, so numerous are the different varieties of the feldspathic family, that it is impossible to recognize and dis tinguish them without a chemical analysis. As far, however, as the feldspathic ingredient can be made out, from an examination of those rocks on Isle Royale and Keweenaw Point, in which there is a porphyritic structure, and separate crystals can be observed, they appear to have the crystalline character of the labradorite variety. They also fuse much more readily before the blowpipe than orthoclase, yielding a transparent, colorless and blebby glass. The results of the analyses seem also to indicate, from the nature and relative quantity of the protoxide bases, lime and soda, that the feldspathic ingredient is labradorite. If, therefore, in the above analyses we assume that all the alumina belongs to 4he labradorite, and that the other ingredient is one in which alumina is not contained, we can reckon the amount of oxygen of the silica and the bases (RO) necessary to form labradorite. In the first analysis, that of the greenstone from the Cliff-mine, the oxygen of the alumina being 7.22, if we deduct the double of that amount from the silica, and one-third from the protoxide bases, we have remaining : Oxygen of silica 11.64 \" protoxide bases - 6.77 \" water - 1.55 And in the other rock, from Rock Harbor, we have, in the same manner, remaining : Oxygen of silica^ 10.37 \" protoxide bases 7.1 \" water 2.18 The results of these analyses correspond pretty nearly with that of the trap of the\" Feroe islands, by Durocher.* In his analysis, after deducting from the oxygen of the silica and the protoxide bases an amount corres ponding with that of the alumina, in the proper proportion to form labrado rite, there remains : Oxygen of silica 9.52 \" protoxide bases \u2014 \u2022-. 7.36 \" water 2.66 Durocher considers that this implies the existence of a mineral analogous to diallage, or a bisilicate of bases with one atom of oxygen +hydrate of magnesia. In fact, if we deduct from the protoxide bases an amount of oxygen equal to that of the water, we have remaining a silicate, in which the oxygen of the silica is nearly the double that of the bases. The great difficulty in this case is to know what part the water plays in the constitu tion of the mineral. As far as our researches go, all the trappean rocks seem to contain from two to three per cent, of wTater. Recent investiga tions, however, still leave it doubtful whether this water belongs to the feldspathic mineral, or whether it may not be due to an intermixture of * Annales des Mines, Ser. III., Vol, 19, p. 547."], [370, "[4] 90 chlorite in the trappean rock. The observations of Delesse seem to prove that water is constantly present in the feldspathic portion of the trappean rocks analyzed by him. This is a point on which, however, we can give no lio-ht, as we have not been able to isolate and analyze the feldspar of any of our trappean rocks. We see, however, that chlorite is abundant in them, and a portion, at least, of their water must be ascribed to its pre sence. In this case, if we take into consideration the variable composition of the hornblendic or pyroxenic portion of the rock, the fact that a part of the water may belong to the feldspathic portion, and that the iron is pro bably partially present as the magnetic oxide, we shall see that the difficul ties in the way of arriving at a complete knowledge of the mineralogical composition of these rocks, by analysis of them as a whole, are nearly insuperable. The only variety of trappean rock occurring in the Keweenaw Point range, in which the ingredients are distinctly visible, so that we have been able to make out its composition, we find to be made up of a light-red feldspathic portion, having the character of labradorite, of a dark-green foliated mineral, which is probably pyroxene, chlorite and magnetic iron. This variety occurs at Lac la Belle, and it graeluates imperceptibly into the common, compact, crystalline greenstone, in which the separate minerals are no longer to be distinguished by the eye. This we consider to be the most probable composition of the dark, crystalline varieties of the trappean rocks on Keweenaw Point and Isle Royale. We have also on Isle Royale, beds of a porphyritic rock, intercalated among the crystalline greenstones, which are composed essentially of a felds pathic ingredient, which is probably labradorite, and magnetic iron ; the feldspar is of a light-greenish tinge, and occasionally exhibits metallic reflec tions ; the crystals, are, however, very minute. Both on Isle Royale and west of Portage lake, epidote becomes a predo minant ingredient of the trappean rocks, forming beds and vein-like masses in it. In the Porcupine mountains and in the vicinity of Agogebic lake, we have this mineral forming masses of such dimensions that it must be regarded as a rock : it is often amygdaloidal, like the other varieties of the trappean rocks. The presence of free or uncombined silica in the trappean rocks, except when it forms a part of the vein-stones, is exceedingly rare. Where, how ever, the trap becomes epidotic, quartz not unfrequently occurs, filling the amygdaloidal cavities. In the veins of the Ontonagon region, where epidote abounds, both as part of the rock-masses and in the veins, quartz forms the predominating gangue. The zeolitic minerals, so common in the veins, and often filling the amyg daloidal cavities of the trap, do not appear to form an essential ingredient of the compact trappean rocks. None of them, as far as we have examined, when acted on by acids, give any gelatinous silica. Carbonate of lime, so common in the veins of the trap, seems to be rarely present in the compact trappean rocks, as few of them effervesce with acids. From the same rea son, we infer the almost entire absence of carbonate of iron. The mineral nepheline is not found in any of these rocks, unless it be in one locality on Isle Royale, near the end of Blake's Point, where the mass is made up of a fine-grained mixture of magnetic oxide of iron and a light greenish-colored material, which fuses readily before the blowpipe, and resembles nepheline in lustre and general appearance."], [371, "[4] 91 Olivine is entirely wanting in all these rocks, as far as we have been tWe to ascertain. On the whole, these rocks may, in all probability, be classed with that member of the trap family, in which are included dolerite, anamesite and basalt. This class of igneous products is developed on a grand scale in Iceland, in the northern part of Ireland, and in Scotland. On the Faroe islands and in Iceland they have been poured out in lava-sheets of great extent and regularity, which, like those of Isle Royale, are piled upon each other in numerous strata-like masses, exhibiting almost the appearance of sedimentary deposits. TRAPPEAN ROCKS OF THE AZOIC SYSTEM. If the study of the mineralogical composition of the trappean rocks associated \\tfth the Potsdam sandstone is one of great perplexity and diffi- culty, this is still more the case in regard to the igneous rocks which occur in connection with the azoic system. So numerous are the varieties of these rocks, and so limited has been the time that we have been able to bestow on their examination, that we have accomplished but little towards arriving; at a knowledge of their complex and obscure mineralogical character. The first thing which strikes the observer, in passing over the intercalations of io-neous rocks among the azoic slaty and quartzose strata, is the difficulty of making a distinction between the purely igneous and metamorphic rocks. The passage of one into the other, especially in the southern portion of the district, seems, in many cases, to be so gradual, and their general appearance and structure is so much alike, that it is often difficult to say where one begins and the other ends ; add to this, the very great physical difficulties in the way of a minute exploration of the almost inaccessible region in which they occur, difficulties of which those who have not themselves experienced them can form but a faint idea, and we shall not be considered as having neglected to do all in our power to throw light on this interesting subject. The io-neouS products which are associated with the azoic system are, so far as we have examined them, perfectly compact and homogeneous. They are entirely destitute of the amygdaloidal structure which characterizes the traps described as occurring in connection with the sandstone and conglome- rate of Keweenaw Point and Isle Royale. They are, likewise, wanting in the zeolitic minerals which are so abundant in the amygdaloidal traps, and are, in every respect, more uniform in their texture and appearance than these. In general, the mixture of the different mineral ingredients of which these rocks are made up is very intimate, and we have never seen them \u2022 assume a porphyritic structure, or developed in crystals of sufficient size to be separated and analyzed. Thus we are reduced to the necessity of ana- lyzing the rock as a whole, if we would wish to obtain any more satisfactory insight into its real composition. If we consider, for a moment, the manner in which these igneous masses must have been formed, and the circumstances under which they were poured out from the interior of the earth, we cannot expect to find an abso- lute uniformity of texture or of composition, in the different sheets of plastic matter, which were spread out over the surface at different periods during the same geological epoch ; but may reasonably expect that, during the con- tinuance of the same general causes, the igneous products will be, in some decree, characterized bv peculiarities of composition."], [372, "[4] 92 We will now proceed to the detail of the results of the examination of these rocks ; and first, we will take up the trappean rock of which Presqu'isle is composed. Analysis of the Igneous Rock of Presqu'isle. \u2014 A peculiar variety of rock occurs at Presqu'isle, and forms the principal portion of that projection of the coast. It has all the aspect of an igneous, or eruptive rock. Its color is a deep-green, almost black, and it is apparently homogeneous in its composition. It is somewhat columnar in its structure, resembling some varieties of basalt. It is all readily attracted by the magnet, when broken into small fragments, but no distinct particles of magnetic iron can be per-. ceived in it. Before the blowpipe, it hardly undergoes any change when heated in the platina forceps ; it becomes slightly rounded on the edges and remains magnetic. It is only partially soluble in strong chlorohydric acid, after long digestion at a temperature near boiling. It contains both the protoxide and peroxide of iron. A portion of the minerali which had been previously ignited in a stream of carbonic acid gas, lost by reduction with hydrogen only 3.87 per cent., so that by far the larger portion of the iron is in a state of combina tion in which it cannot be reduced by ignition in a stream of hydrogen. The analysis gave : Silica 38.24 Magnesia --- - 14.83 Alumina \u2014 * 1.48 Lime ----- 1.42 Water 9.53 Peroxide and protoxide of iron and a little soda 34.50 100.00 The amount of iron, as found by the analysis, and calculated as a peroxide, is 34.59 per cent.; but, on testing the solution of the mineral in chlorohydric acid, attacked in an atmosphere of carbonic acid gas, it was found that both the oxides of this metal were present in it. Want of time rendered it im possible for us to complete the analysis. From the above results, it appears that the substance is essentially a hydrous silicate of magnesia and the protoxide and peroxide of iron. This rock differs in its external character anel chemical composition from any occurring elsewhere in our district, and it is difficult to refer it to any known class of rocks ; it approaches somewhat nearly, in composition, the mineral Hisingerite. The trappean ridges which accompany the iron of the azoic slates are in teresting and important, from their connection with the valuable deposits of this metal, as those of the Silurian with the copper. An examination was made of the rock from section 10, township 47, range 27, as a good sample of the kind of trappean rock most nearly connected with the iron. It forms a high ridge, just south of the great ferriferous band extending through that section. The rock is of a light-green color, tough, made up of a finely foliated and lamellar hornblende, with a small proportion of a feldspathic ingredient, which is not distinctly to be made out, as it is not crystallized, but which appears to have the lustre and degree of fusibility of labradorite. A few specks of iron pyrites are scattered through the rock ; and this mine ral is common to all the trappean rocks of the azoic series. It is not easy"], [373, "[4] 93 to decide whether the main ingredient of the rock is pyroxene, or hornblende, as the crystallization is too - confused to allow of the measurement of the cleavage planes ; but, as far as can be judged by the eye, it seems to be horn- blende rather than pyroxene. Portions of the hornblendic element of the rock have a bright grass-green color, like coccolite, and are of a granular texture. The following are the results of a single analysis : Oxygen. Silica 46.31 24.06 Alumina 11.14 5.21 Protoxide of iron 21.69 4.82 Lime 9.68 2.76 Soda 6.91 1.78 Water 4.44 Magnesia trace 100.17 The large quantity of water is remarkable, and we content ourselves with stating the fact, without attempting to go into the discussion of the part which it plays in the constitution of the rock. If we neglect the water, and considering the feldspathic element as labra dorite, deduct from the oxygen of the silica and the protoxide bases, a quan tity corresponding with the composition of this mineral, taking all the alu mina as belonging to it, we shall have remaining : 15.64 oxygen of silica. 7.63 oxygen of protoxide bases. This would make a silicate, in which the oxygen of the silica was the double of that of the bases RO, namely, hornblende or pyroxene. Thus, the composition of the rock would be a mixture of labradorite and pyroxene, together with water. The above analysis may be taken as a representation of the rocks accom panying the iron in the northern portion of the azoic region ; in the more southerly part of the district, along the course of the Menomonee, there seem to be two classes of igneous rocks ; one, a very compact, dark, horn blendic variety, with occasional crystals of a feldspathic mineral, probably labrador, interspersed ; and the other, a much lighter-colored rock, and in appearance more resembling the granite family. A specimen of the light-colored, homogeneous rock from the Menomo nee, about four miles below Sturgeon falls, was particularly examined. Before the blowpipe it fuses. readily to a colorless, transparent, glass; it is very incompletely dissolved in chlorohydric acid. The analysis gave : Silica 54.54 Alumina ... 21.45 Peroxide of iron 5.53 Lime 8.40 Soda 7_54 Magnesia ,., trace Water -. - 2.54 100,00"], [374, "[4] 94 This is very nearly the composition of labradorite, so that it would seem to be a massive feldspathic rock, or a feldstein of the Germans, which name has been adopted into the English language by Sedgwick, and called by him feldstone. The same rock occurs along the Menomonee, from Sandy portage to Big Bekuenesec falls, forming cliffs two hundred feet high ; it occasionally takes into its composition a little of a light-greenish mineral, which resem bles serpentine, or talc, in appearance. There are some rocks, in the same region, whether purely igneous or met amorphic, it is difficult to say, which partake somewhat of the nature of serpentine, though we have not recognized any perfectly distinctly marked specimens of this substance. A passage from rocks of this class into horn blende and chlorite slates may not unfrequently be noticed. Of this uncer tain composition is the rock which is exposed in ledges on the road from the Jackson landing to the Forge, which is of a character intermediate between a trappean and serpentine rock. In one respect, many of these igneous rocks resemble serpentine, and might, on that account, be considered as likely to contain intermixed portions of that mineral ; this is the large percentage of water which they are found to contain, even when presenting a perfectly fresh and undecomposed ap pearance. This water may, however, with equal probability, be referred to the presence of chlorite, which is certainly an 'occasional ingredient of these rocks, although by no means as frequent as in the traps of the Silurian series. There is evidently a gradual passage of serpentine and steatite into horn blende rock, and they all occur so intermingled, and under such a variety of form, that no exact lines of demarcation can here be drawn between them. On the whole, as far as our researches on the trappean rocks of the azoic series will justify us in drawing any general conclusions as to their place in the classification of these igneous products, we are inclined to refer them to the diorite family, though the feldspathic element is certainly not in all cases albite, which is generally recognized as being an essential ingredient of this class of rocks. The difficulty of determining this point, however, is very great, inasmuch as this mineral forms comparatively a small proportion of the mass, and exhibits only a granular structure. We ought to advert to the large percentage of iron which all these rocks of the azoic series are found to contain, and which is a fact important in its connexion with the immense deposits of the oxides of this metal which are associated with them. This iron is mostly in the form of the silicate ofithe protoxide, in the purely igneous varieties : when, however, they pass into slates, or assume the appearance of the metamorphic rocks, the iron appears in great abundance in the form of the bisulphuret, or iron-pyrites."], [375, "[4] 95 CHAPTER VII. MINERALOGY. The following list, arranged alphabetically, comprises all the minerals which have been found in the sandstone and conglomerate, together with the associated trappean rocks of the Lake Superior copper region, as far as we have been able to determine. We have also included the few minerals which occur in the azoic slates and the associated igneous rocks. We have added, under the head of each mineral substance, such informa tion concerning its crystalline form, chemical composition, and peculiarities of occurrence, as may be of interest to the mineralogist and practical miner. The intimate connection between the occurrence of valuable ores and their associated gangues need not to be insisted on ; and it is evident that infor mation with regard to the veinstones and associated minerals of the copper bearing rocks forms an important addition to the geological description of this region. Actinolite. \u2014 See Hornblende. Agate. \u2014 See Quartz. Albite. \u2014 See Feldspar. Amethysts \u2014 See Quartz. Analcime. \u2014 This mineral has been found in several localities, in beauti fully crystallized specimens. The crystals are all trapezohedra : they are never transparent, but generally nearly opaque. They are tinged with various colors : light flesh-red, by suboxide of copper, or green, by car bonate or silicate of the same metal ; the crystals which contain no copper vary from white to a light-grey or reddish- white. The largest crystals are about an inch in diameter. At the Copper Falls mine, the crystals of analcime are associated with calc-spar, and are influenced in their crystal line form by this mineral in a singular manner. A mass of calc-spar, for instance, will exhibit, on its surface, numerous crystals of analcime, of each of which, however, only from two to four of the trapezohedral faces are visible. On cleaving off the calc-spar with care, it will be seen that the analcime has been prolonged, sometimes for an inch or more, between the crystalline planes of the calc-spar, being compressed, as if by the more powerful crystalline force of the latter mineral, into four-sided prisms, on the summits of which, as they have emerged from the calc-spar, the trape zohedral faces have been formed with their usual lustre and appearance. At the old workings of the Pittsburg Company, at Copper Harbor, in the conglomerate, this mineral was found in abundance ; in fact, it formed no inconsiderable portion of the gangue of the vein. The crystals were generally colored by suboxide of copper, and associated with an argil laceous substance, which was very liable to crumble, and thus destroy the value of the specimens. At Eagle Harbor, crystals of analcime occur, which are filled with a fine net- work of native copper, which has not, how ever, prevented the perfect development of the crystalline faces. Other localities of this mineral are : \u2014 East bank of Eagle river ; Lake Superior company's mine ; Massachusetts location. Apophyllite. \u2014 This mineral is found in considerable abundance, and in fine crystals, at several localities. At the Cliff mine, the crystallized spe-"], [376, "[4] 96 cimens are all tabular, the faces P greatly predominating over M. The planes a1 are developed so that M appears only as a small quadrilateral plane. The crystals are from one-eighth to one-fourth of an inch in diameter ; they are, occasionally, transparent and colorless. At the North American mine, they occur in abundance, mostly in octohedra, with a square base, the face P being entirely wanting on most of the specimens, and when it occurs it is very small. At the former locality the crystals occur in connection with native cop per, in small cavities in the masses, and separated from the metal by a thin band of silicious matter. The foliated variety (ichthyophthalmite) occurs at the Prince mine, on the north shore of the lake. Asbestus. \u2014 See Hornblende. Augite. \u2014 See Hornblende. Azurite. \u2014 See Copper, carbonate of. Baryta, Sulphate of. \u2014 This mineral occurs abundantly m the conglome rate, and occasionally forms veins of considerable magnitude. The finest crystallized specimens have been found at the works of the Mendenhall mining company, on Mineral creek. The ore obtained there consisted of calc-spar and sulphate of baryta impregnated with sulphuret of copper. The crystals are tabular in form, and colorless and transparent : they occur implanted on the gangue and are very abundant, but do not exceed a quar ter of an inch in diameter. Near Agate Harbor the cock's-comb variety occurs abundantly, in a vein in the conglomerate, associated with calc-spar and sulphuret of copper. At both the above-mentioned localities the great weight of the sulphate of baryta, colored deeply by from eight to ten per cent. of black sulphuret of copper, led to the erroneous idea that the ore was very rich in this metal. Blende. \u2014 See Zinc, sulphuret of. Calc-spar. \u2014 This mineral constitutes an essential part of most of the veins, both in the sandstone and conglomerate, as well as in the trappean rocks ; together with quartz it forms the almost invariable gangue of the copper, and it also occurs by itself in veins of great width, which are prin cipally found in the conglomerate. Crystallized specimens occur at many loca lities. A few of the more interesting forms may be mentioned. At Copper Falls, Eagle Harbor, Agate Harbor, the Cliff mine, and North American mine, in the form of an obtuse rhombohedron, cuboide of Haiiy. The crystals are often filled with bright spangles of native copper. At the old workings at Copper Harbor, highly modified scalene-triangular dodecahedra, also six sided prisms, the latter of small size but perfectly transparent and colorless. The oolorless crystals were implanted on the massive calcareous spar in the vein, and evidently formed posteriorly to the latter. At Agate Harbor, the dog-tooth variety was found in the greatest abundance, nearly the whole mass of the vein being made up of a congeries of crystals of this form and of a light-bluish color, associated with cock's-comb spar, and, generally, colored by sulphuret of copper. At the Mendenhall company's location, beautiful hemitropic crystals of the scalene-triangular dodecahedron were found. At Presqu' isle, an abundance of finely-crystallized specimens was thrown out by the company engaged in mining at that place. The crystals are nearly all hexagonal prisms with trihedral summits, some of which are an inch in diameter, and one or two inches in length. They would be verv fine cabi-"], [377, "[4] 97 net specimens, had not nearly all the crystals undergone a molecular change for a depth of half a line, which has rendered them dull and rough upon the surface. The calc-spar is here associated with galena, and is posterior to this mineral. At the same locality handsome dog-tooth crystals occur. At Copper Harbor, in the black oxide vein, numerous fine crystallizations ed' this mineral were obtained. They were mostly six-sided prisms, with numerous additional planes, and scalene-triangular dodecahedra. Carnelian. \u2014 See Quartz. Chabasie. \u2014 Doubtful if found in the Lake Superior region, which is an interesting fact, inasmuch as this mineral occurs commonly among the trap pean rocks in numerous localities. Chlorastrolite. \u2014 This mineral was first observed by Dr. Locke, on the shores of Isle Royale, and afterwards obtained by Mr. J. H. Blake. It was analyzed, and described as a new mineral by Mr. Whitney, in the fifth volume of the Boston Natural History Society's Journal. The name, chlorastro lite, was given to it by Dr. C. T. Jackson, in allusion to its greenish color and stellated structure. It occurs in finely radiated, stellated masses, with a pearly lustre, and slightly chatoyant on the rounded sides. Hardness 5.5 to 6 : specific gra vity 3.180 : color light bluish-green. Its behaviour before the blowpipe is as follows : In the open tube it yields water, and becomes white. In the platina forceps it fuses with great facility to a greyish, blebby glass. It intumesces and swells up like a zeolite. Soda dissolves it in small quantity, and gives a bead colored by a trace of manganese : if more of the assay be added, it swells up to an infusible slag. It is elissolved by borax readily, and in considerable quantity, and gives a transparent glass colored by iron. Salt of phosphorus dissolves it in small quantity, and gives the reaction of iron. With nitrate of cobalt it gives a beautiful blue. It is readily dissolved by chlorohydric acid, the silica being entirely sepa rated in the form of a stocky precipitate. The analysis of two specimens gave : I. II.

The ratio of the oxygen of the water, protoxide bases, the peroxide bases and the silica, is nearly 1 : 1 : 2 : 3 ; and the formula is, therefore : -So! Si01 + 2\u00a3;g.jSiO, + 3HO This formula is that of meionite, with the addition of three atoms of water. The calculated percentage of the mineral, according to the above for mula, is as follows, assuming that the bases R2 03 are represented by six sevenths of alumina, and one-seventh of peroxide of iron, and the bases R 0 by lime six-sevenths and soda one-seventh : Silica 38.25 Alumina --- 24.32 Peroxide of iron i 6.31 Lime 19.97 Soda 3.70 Water 7.45 100.00 The chlorastrolite has been cut and polished for the purpose of orna mental jewelry, and makes a very pretty gem. The best specimens are found in the form of rounded masses, which have been loosened from the trap, and worn and polished by the water ; they are most abundant on the small islands, near the north-eastern end of Isle Royale. This mineral is found in the rock at Chippewa harbor : the largest specimens which have been found are about an inch in diameter. A mineral much resembling chlorastrolite occurs, on Isle Royale, in radia ted epidote, in the form of small fibrous, radiated masses. The color is a light bluish-green. The quantity which could be obtained of it for analy sis was so small, and it was so difficult to free it from the gangue, that the following analysis can only be regarded as an approximation. Silica _ : 42.6 Alumina and oxide of iron -- 31.2 Lime - 20.6 Water 5.2 99.6 As the ratio of the oxygen of the silica, alumina and oxide of iron, lime and water are, approximately, 3 : 2 : 1 : 1, it is not improbable that the above may be a hydrous epidote; which supposition is rendered more pro bable by its mode of occurrence, in fibrous nodules enclosed in radiated and massive epidote. Chlorite. \u2014 This mineral occurs abundantly in the trappean rocks, and is disseminated through them in fine particles, or fills the amygdaloidal cavities of the rock. It is very commonly found covering the surface of the amyg dules of calcareous spar, interposed between the latter mineral and the trap. It is also a constant accompaniment of the veins, e.specially in the Ontonagon"], [379, "[4] 99 region, where it forms a large part of the gangue, and is associated with quartz. It occurs in large masses interposed between the sandstone and the trap, on Keweenaw Point and in the Porcupine mountains. At the mine of the Union company, a bed of chlorite, lying between the trap and sanel stone, was worked for copper, which was interspersed through the mass in fine and delicate films, and which most frequently occurred lining the exte rior surface of the amygdules of calc-spar ; these were scattered through the chloritic mass. Chrysocolla. \u2014 See Copper, silicate of. Copper, Native. \u2014 This metal is in every respect the most interesting substance found in connection with the trappean rocks of the Lake Superior region. Its wide distribution, and mode of occurrence in them, have been already described in the first part of this report, and it will only be neces sary to add some few particulars of mineralogical interest, to what has already been said with regard to this metal. In addition to the enormous masses which occur in the veins of this region, sometimes attaining at the Cliff mine the weight of several hundreel tons, a great variety of interesting crystalline forms are occasionally found. The most interesting localities of the crystallizeel copper are at the Copper Falls, the Cliff, the Ph\u0153nix (formerly Lake Superior), and the Eagle Harbor mines. Unfortunately, but few good crystals have come into our possession, as they are highly valued by those interested in the mines, and of course eliffi cult to be obtained, except by those residing at the localities where they occur. The finest crystals which we have obtained were from the Cliff mine, where they are frequently thrown out with the gangue, which is generally, where the copper occurs crystallizeel, drusy quartz associated with calcare ous spar. These crystals are generally tetrahexahedra ; the largest which we have is one-fourth of an inch in diameter. The twenty-ibur-faced figure is formed by two replacements on each edge of the cube by the plane b3. The crystals, however, are rarely perfect, being almost always much dis torted ; and, often, only one or two crystalline planes are to be recognized on the extremity of a shapeless, elongated mass. We have seen, from the Cliff and Copper Falls mines, octohedral crystals, some of which were nearly an inch in diameter ; cubical crystals also occur at the last named locality. An abundance of dendritic, or arborescent forms, have been obtained at the Eagle Harbor and Copper Falls mines, but their planes are too imperfect to allow their detailed structure to be made out. A beautiful instance of the crystalline form of one mineral modifying the form of another, crystallizing within it, was noticed at the same locality, where the compound group of twin crystals lay within a crystal of trans parent calc-spar, and the individuals of which had assumeel, in reference to the main stem, the angle of the rhombohedral crystal in which they were enclosed. No doubt, as these mines are farther opened, an abundance of interesting forms will be developed. Crystals of analcime occur at Copper Falls, which are completely filled, throughout their whole interior, with delicate ramifi cations of metallic copper, so that, if the silicious material were dissolved out, the form of the crystal would still be recognized by the mass of metallic matter remaining. Copper, black oxide of. \u2014 This substance was found in large quantities, forming a vein in the conglomerate at Copper Harbor. Its geological posi-"], [380, "m 100 tion has been described in a previous report. This, so far as known, is the only instance of the occurrence of this substance in a state of purity, and forming the principal mass of a vein. It is not to be confounded with the substance known to mineralogists as \" copper-black,\" which is a pro duct of the decomposition of other ores, and a mechanical mixture of various hydrated oxides, especially of iron, manganese and copper. The name of Tenorite has been given to the oxide of copper found in minute hexagonal scales on the lava of Vesuvius. As we were present at Copper Harbor during a portion of the time while this vein was being worked (in 1845), we had a good opportunity of seeing the real nature of the ores. We searched all the masses thrown out, at that time, for crystallized specimens of this substance, but without succeed ing in finding any. Mr. J. E. Teschemacher has, however, discovered in the masses, mined after that time, and sent down to Boston, a number of crystals, which are cubes with their solid angles replaced. The question therefore arises, whether this is really a dimorphous substance. Mr. Tesche macher has suggested that these crystals may originally have been crystals of red oxide of copper, and that they have been converted into the black oxide by the agency of heat. In regard to this, it may be said, that crystallized red oxide of copper occurs abundantly in the same vein, but that the crystals are all octohedral; moreover, the crystals of Cu2 O occur implanted on metallic copper, when, according to Mr. Hayes's views, they ought to have undergone the greatest amount of heat, and, therefore, to have been converted into black oxide. We are inclined, in every point of view, to regard the whole formation of the black oxide vein as one which occurred in the humid, rather than in the dry way, and see no sufficient reason to suppose the cubic crystals of CuO pseudomorphs. Portions of the black oxide of copper are mingled with silicates of the oxide, more or less hydrous, but large masses were obtained of almost pure CuO. Severa 1 analyses of the black oxide have been made by us, which show the presence of from one to two per cent, of impurities, mostly silex, lime, and iron, in the massive varieties. The following is a mineralogical description of this remarkable mineral : Substance tesseral ; crystallized in cubes with their solid angles replaced ; generally found massive ; no distinct cleavage ; hardness, about 3 ; specifi.; gravity, 6.25; color, steel-gray to black ; lustre, sub-metallic ; the earthy varieties acquire a metallic lustre on being scratched with the knife ; opaque; chemical composition. Copper 79.86 Oxygen 20.14 j 100.00 Copper, red oxide of. \u2014 This substance is found in numerous localities, but rarely in very fine specimens. The best were obtained from the black oxide vein at Copper Harbor, where they occurred crystallized in octohedra, and implanted on masses of native copper. A few very fine specimens were obtained here, the crystals being about one-eighth of an inch in diameter, and very perfect. The capillary variety, of a beautiful cochineal-reel, was observed near the surface of the vein of the Cliff mine, when first opened, evidently a"], [381, "101 [4] secondary product. Numerous minerals throughout the copper region are colored of a beautiful red tint by the presence of the substance. Copper, carbonate of . \u2014 The green carbonate occurs in numerous locali ties, but only in very small and unconspicuous masses, resulting from the action of meteoric agencies on the metallic copper. The blue carbonate is much rarer; and we have, in fact, only noticed.it in minute quantities in two or three localities. The green carbonate occurs in slender fasiculated fibres, in the cavities of the amygdaloid, at Copper falls; azurite, or the blue car bonate, is found m small quantities at the Algonquin location. Copper, phosphate of . \u2014 Occurs at Copper Harbor, forming a delicate incrustation over some of the masses of the black oxide. Copper, silicate of. \u2014 Chrysocolla, or the hydrated silicate of copper, was obtained in considerable quantity from the so called \" black oxide vein,\" at Fort Wilkins. In the outer belt of conglomerate at Copper Harbor, the same vein was made up principally of calcareous spar mixed with, and stained by, silicate of copper. This vein, projecting into the lake, was long known to the voyagers as \" the green rock.\" The silicate was occasion ally quite pure, and of a fine bluish-green color, but more frequently mixed with ferruginous and argillaceous matter, or, sometimes, with the black oxide. Dioptase, also a hydrated silicate of copper, but containing only one-half the quantity of water of the chrysocolla, is said to have been found in minute crystals at the same locality. Copper, sulphuret of, and Copper Pyrites.\u2014 Copper pyrites, or sul phuret of iron and copper, Cu2 S + Fe2 S\u201e occurs in minute particles, occa sionally, in the native copper mines. In the southern trap range on Keweenaw Point, the sulphurets of copper are the prevailing ores, and are sound in considerable quantity. Copper pyrites occurs at Lac la Belle, in the vein, and scattered in particles through the rock adjoining ; but the greater portion of the metalliferous contents of the lode at this mine are the vitreous and va riegated ores (Cu2 S and FeS + 2 Cu2 S). They are not crystallized, as far as we have observed. The sulphurets of copper have been mined also at the locations of the Suffolk and Mendenhall companies. In the latter case, the ore was mainly sulphate of baryta, colored by sulphuret of copper. 'The same was the case at the workings of the New York and Michigan com pany, the vein, in both these cases, being in the conglomerate. In the azoic system, copper pyrites is found in small quantities in a gangue of quartz, which forms veins traversing the slates. On the north shore of the lake, the sulphurets, especially pyritous copper, have been extensively worked at the Bruce mine, and the Prince vein. Arsenical copper pyrites occurs at the Medora mine on Keweenaw Point. Copper, vanadate of. \u2014 The vanadate of copper is said, by Mr. Tesche macher, to have been found at the Cliff mine ; we have been unable to detect the presence of vanadium in any of the specimens which we have found there, and Mr. Schlieper, to whom Mr. Teschemacher referred his speci mens for examination, was not able to satisfy himself of the existence of vanadium in them. Datholite.\u2014No mineral occurring in this region affords more beautiful and abundant specimens than this. The principal localities are on Isle Royale, where it forms, in some cases, nearly the whole gangue of the copper-bearing vein. By far the finest locality of crystallized specimens is in township 65, range 34, section 10, where beautiful groups of crystals,"], [382, "[4] 102 __ of which were half jMk *\u00a3\u00a3 5__\u00a3ti 2f .*_\u00a3 _> implanted on ,n,s sive da thote, v>hteh . s^ rf copper in the vein is associated wrrn allizations of the same worth while to make an analysis of the massive vaSy of this mineral, the results of which show that it is equaUy^as pure as \u00a3 crystallized, and agree well with those required by the formula.

It occurs, a so, in sine acicuia crystallizations, which have a striking resemblance tc , stilbite, at the Cop per Falls mine, where it is associated, in the vein, with c^e0U?sJ\u2122*\u2122 native copper.

The feldspar is evidently posterior, in its forma tion, both to the copper and the calcareous spar, and must be considered here as an undoubted aqueous product. Labradorite is the prevailing variety of the feldspar family in the trap pean rocks of Keweenaw Point and Isle Royale : it is generally so inter mixed with the /)ther ingredients of the rock as not to be distinguished by the eye; but, in the porphyritic belts of Isle Royale, it occurs in distinct crystals of a green color. For an analysis of the orthoclase of the granite of the azoic region, see the chapter on the igneous rocks. In the same chapter will be found an analysis of the massive labradorite, or feldstone, of the azoic series. Orthoclase forms almost the entire mass of extensive ridges in the gra nite, south of the azoic slates, through the whole extent of our district. Fluor-spar. \u2014 The orjdy localities in which this mineral has been found in our district, as far as we know, are at Copper Falls, where small cubic crystals were obtained, which hardly exceeded an eighth of an inch in diameter; and about a mile above Eagle Harbor, in the conglomerate. On the north side of the lake, fine specimens have been obtained at Prince's bay, where it occurs in cubical crystals of a green color. It also occurs on Fluor island. ; Galena. \u2014 At Presqu'isle, this mineral occurs in a variety of crystalline forms ; namely, the cube, the octahedron, the octahedron with its solid angles replaced, and the dodecahedron. Some of the crystals show a very beauti ful, secondary crystalline action induced upon the faces of the original crys tal. Thus, the sides of the cubic crystal have become, apparently, rough ened on the surface, as if a coarse file had been drawn across them ; but, on examination with the microscope, it will be seen that this appearance is due to the projection from the surface of numerous minute facets of the octohe dron, of which the^olid angles project beyond the surface. In other in stances, the whole crystal is made up of very thin plates, laid one upon the other, retreating by steps. In other crystals, the whole side of the cubic crystal is made up of the minute plates of which the edges are indented with triangular notches, showing a tendency of the surface of the original crystal to develope into octohedral forms. Similar phenomena of crystalli zation have been noticed in other minerals, especially fluor-spar and salt. The variety of quartz, called Babel quartz, presents a structure similar to that displayed by some of the crystals of galena at this locality. Garnet. \u2014 In the mica slates of the southern portion of the district, this mineral occurs, not unfrequently, but the specimens are of little interest. Gypsum \u2014 Occurs in small quantity in the Niagara limestone of the shore of Lake Michigan, but no good crystallizations have been found. We have seen specimens said to be from St. Martin's island, but were unable to discover it there ; at the time of our visit, the deposit was, probably, under water. Beds of plaster are marked on the map as occurring on the east shore of Green bay, but we traversed a large portion of that coast, without succeeding in discovering this valuable mineral. Harmotome. \u2014 A single specimen of this mineral is said by Mr. Tesche macher to have been found on Isle Royale by Mr. J. H. Blake. The most careful examination has failed to reveal the presence of this mineral to us in our explorations on that island, or on Keweenaw Point. Heulandite. \u2014 This mineral is said to have been found on the north shore of the lake, but we are not aware of its occurrence in our district. HorMende. \u2014 This mineral occurs in abundance in the slates and trappean"], [384, "104 [4] rocks of the azoic system, but nowhere developed in very distinct crystals. It is generally of a deep-green color, almost black, sometimes thinly foliated, and sometimes asbestiform. Iron, magnetic oxide of, and peroxide of. \u2014 The nature of the occurrence of these ores has already been discussed at length in the geological portion of this report, so that it will not be necessary to enter into any farther par ticulars respecting them. The specular oxide which occurs in the quartz veins cutting the massive beds of iron, is in large and brilliant plates, and affords very pretty specimens. Crystals of magnetic oxide occur in abundance in the chloritic slates, associated with the azoic rocks, and in the proximity of the massive ores. Magnetic iron forms one of the most common and almost unfailing mine rals of the trappean rocks of the Silurian age. Associated with labradorite, it forms beds of porphyry, intercalated among the compact and crystalline traps of Isle Royale. Iron Pyrites. \u2014 One of the most common minerals; it occurs in great abundance in fine particles, scattered through the hornblende rocks of the azoic series. It is found in cubic crystals atPresqu'isle, associated with cal- careous spar. Iron-sand \u2014 Occurs on the shores of the lake in great abundance, and is probably derived from the disintegration of the slaty rocks of the azoic senes. Jasper. \u2014 See Quartz. Labradorite. \u2014 See Feldspar. Laumonite. \u2014 This is one of the most abundant of all the trappean mine rals in the Lake Superior region. It occurs in the bedded trap of Keweenaw Point, filling the amygdules, especially near the contact of the conglomerate and sandstone. It forms a considerable part of the gangue of some of the metalliferous veins, and is especially frequent in the selvages of the veins. On Isle Royale it frequently occurs in thin bands, between the different belts of trappean rock. Near Eagle harbor it forms a wide vein, filled with irregular strings and bunches of copper. Near the location of the Atlas company, in the Porcupine mountains, it forms a considerable portion of the trappean rock, over a great extent of surface. The rapid change which this mineral undergoes, when exposed to the air, by losing a portion of its water, causes the rock containing this mineral to crumble and disintegrate rapidly. The Leonhardite, on the con trary, appears to remain unaltered by exposure. Leonhardite. \u2014 This mineral has a most remarkable resemblance to Lau monite in its general habitus, but appears to have, unquestionably, a differ ent composition, and must, therefore, be classed as a distinct species. The following analyses of this mineral were made by Mr. G. O. Barnes, under Mr. Whitney's direction : I. II. Silica 55.96 55.04 Alumina 21.04 22.34 Lime 10.49 10.64 Water 11.93 11.93 99.42 99.95"], [385, "[4] 105 The formula 3CaOSi03 + 4Al203Si203 + 15HO requires\u2014 Silica 56.57 Alumina 21.99 Lime 9.40 Water 12.02 99.98 This formula differs from that of Laumonite principally in its containing a one-third, (instead of a bi-) silicate in the first term ; and fifteen atoms of water instead of eighteen. This mineral occurs at Copper Falls. It seems to remain unaltered by exposure to the atmosphere, containing less water than Laumonite, and therefore not parting with it so readily as that mineral does. Malachite. \u2014 See Copper, carbonates of. Magnetic Iron Ore. \u2014 See Iron, oxide of. Manganese, oxide of \u2014 Occurs at Manganese lake, near Copper Harbor, and, also, at Presqu'isle, but the specimens are of no mineralogical interest. Mesotype. \u2014 Fine slender prisms of this mineral occur at Copper Falls, associated with analcime, on which mineral they are implanted : it is also implanted directly on the copper, at the same locality. Mesole. \u2014 A mineral resembling mesole, in external character, is found in the amygdaloidal trap of Keweenaw Point. Mica \u2014 Occurs sparingly diffused through the granitic rocks. The great predominance of the feldspathic and quartzose ingredients of the granites, and the comparatively small quantity of mica, is an interesting fact, and especially so, when taken into consideration in connection with the great scarcity of simple minerals in the same rocks. Over the whole region covered by granite-we have hardly found a single mineral of interest, the only foreign substance present, as far as we have observed, besides specks ef hornblende and chlorite, being occasional strings of magnetic iron. Pectolite. \u2014 This mineral occurs on Isle Royale, in spheroidal masses, con sisting of delicate, silky fibres radiating from a centre, and which closely resemble the foreign specimens of this mineral from Monte Baldo. This mineral fuses readily before the blowpipe in the platinum forceps, with but little intumescence, and gives a colorless, blebby glass. Chloro hydric acid dissolves it readily ; the silica separating as a flocky precipitate. The following are the results of the analyses of two specimens from Isle Royale : I. II. Silica 53.45 55.66 Lime 31.21 32.86 Soda 7.37 7.31 Potash - trace Alumina - 4.94 1.45 Water - 2.72 2.72 99.69 100.00 No. I. contains considerable alumina, which, however, does not form an essential part of the mineral ; as is evident from the analysis of No. II., in which only 1.45 per cent, was found. It is difficult to obtain a radiated,"], [386, "106 [4] or fibrous mineral in a slate of perfect purity from the gangue ; there being in each case, a small quantity of quartz in the silica separated by digestion with acid. The results, however, show conclusively that this mineral agrees in constitution with the formula proposed by Von Kobell. Pitchblende. \u2014 A mineral containing uranium, from Maimanse, on the north side of Lake Superior, was analyzed and described by Dr. J. L. Le Conte, under the name of coracite. For analysis and description of this mineral, by Mr. Whitney, also, see Boston Journal of Natural History, Vol. VI., p. 37. This mineral is particularly distinguished from pitchblende by its ready solubility in acids, and hence was supposed by Mr. Whitney, who analyzed it, to contain the oxide of uranium U, 03, and not U3 Op which is generally considered the state of oxidation of the metal in pitchblende. To this view it has been objected that the solubility of the mineral might be owing to the presence of the carbonate of lime contained in it. This view is, however, hardly sustained by facts, since it is often the case that the common pitchblende contains a considerable amount of impurities, and espe cially carbonate of lime, without becoming soluble. A portion of the lime, and the whole of the lead, which the mineral contains, must remain uncom bined, unless we suppose it to play the part of a base in combination with the uranic acid. Pitchstone. \u2014 This mineral occurs in a large mass, in the trap of Isle Royale. An analysis furnished us the following results : Before \"the blowpipe, in the forceps, it swells up considerably and be comes nearly white ; it then fuses without much difficulty to a greyish glass. The fluxes give with it a strong reaction of iron. If finely pulverized, and eligested with chlorohydric acid, it is only imper fectly decomposed, considerable iron being taken up by the acid. An attack by carbonate of soda gave : Silica T-r 62.51 Alumina - - - ' 11.47 Peroxide of iron- -- - 11.05 Lime :- 2.67 Magnesia - 2.11 Soda and trace potash 3.03 by loss. Water - >\u25a0---\u25a0> ---- 7.14 100.00 Pitchstone is generally supposed to be a natural, vitreous product, and, as such, of course no formula can be given for it. The analyses of this sub stance show considerable uniformity of composition, and all exhibit from five to nine per cent, of water. The part which this large amount of water plays in a vitreous product associated with trappean rocks is not easy to explain. Prehnite. \u2014 Hardly any one of the zeolitic minerals is so widely and universally disseminated through the trappean rocks of the Silurian series as Prehnite. It forms one of the predominating minerals in the vein-stone of the copper-bearing veins. Loose, rounded masses of this mineral are common on the beaches of Isle Royale, and often contain fine scales of metallic copper anel native silver distributed through them. Other pebbles of this mineral are colored of a faint flesh-red by suboxide of copper, no"], [387, "[4] 107 metallic copper being present in particles perceptible to the eye. Some of these pebbles have a fibrous structure. The following is an analysis of one of those fibrous, rounded masses, in which no metallic copper could be seen, on examination with the microscope : Silica 44.80 Alumina and trace of iron \u2014 25.34 Lime 24.75 Soda - trace Suboxide of copper - 1-04 Water 4.01 99.94 The finest specimens of Prehnite, which we have seen from this region, were obtained at the location of the Atlas mining company, near the Por- cupine mountains; at which locality the zeolitic minerals form large, flat sheets in the trap. Pyroxene. \u2014 This mineral occurs abundantly as one of the constituents of the trappean rocks, but no where in well-defined crystals. Quartz. \u2014 The specimens of crystallized quartz (rock crystal), which oc- cur in this district, are rarely worthy of notice. The druses of this mineral which occur in the vein, at the Cliff mine, when associated with crystal- lized copper, or Prehnite, sometimes form very elegant specimens. The smoky variety occurs at Rock Harbor, Isle Royale. Amethystine quartz, nearly transparent and of a purplish-violet color, is found in the vein of the Prince mine, on the north side of the lake, and this locality furnishes mag- nificent specimens of deep-colored groups of crystals, associated with calc- spar. It also occurs in the geodes of the trap, near Copper Harbor. Of the varieties of quartz which occur in the south side of the lake, agate is by far the most abundant. It occurs in the cellular cavities of the amygdaloid, and specially in the outer band on the north side of Keweenaw Point, and along the shores of Isle Royale. As this is gradually broken up and disintegrated by the action of the waves, the agates contained in it are accumulated on the beach. In general, the specimens found along the shore of the lake possess little value, except as souvenirs to those who have collected them, though occasionally an agate of considerable size and beauty is found. The finest of which we have any knowledge were found by Professor Mather, on one of the outer reefs of Michipicoten island ; some of the specimens were two feet in diameter. The agates occasionally pass into cacholong and carnelian. Jasper \u2014 Is very abundant, forming mountain-masses in the Porcupine mountains, and at Mount Houghton. Some of that occurring in the Por- cupine is of a brilliant, deep- red color, and beautifully banded.' That of Mount Houghton assumes, at times, a ribboned structure, but is so fusile, that it is difficult to procure good specimens. (Vide Part I, p. 65, 70.) It also occurs abundantly in the azoic series, forming alternating bands with the iron ores. It is of a deep-red color and susceptible of a high po- lish. (Vide Part II, ch. IV.) Scapolite. \u2014 This mineral was fouud in prismatic crystals at Twin falls, Menomonee river. Serpentine. \u2014 An occasional ingredient of the trappean and metamorphic rocks in the southern portion of the azoic region. Silver, native. \u2014 This metal occurs diffused through the trap, at various"], [388, "[ 4 ] 108 localities on Keweenaw Point and Isle Royale : in fact, its distribution is coextensive with that of native copper ; but the principal portion of that which has been obtained thus far, was from the old Lake Superior (now Ph\u0153nix), the Cliff, the Copper Falls, and the Minnesota mines. The silver occurs in connection with the metallic copper, both metals being united together at their edges, and yet each being almost entirely pure, and free from alloy with the other. The silver is almost invariably accompanied by a greenish, hydrous silicate of alumina and iron. The most curious speci mens are those in which the silver occurs in patches, like the crystals of feld spar in a porphyry. There is nothing of particular interest to add with regard to crystallization, since, so far as we have observed, no crystals of this metal have been found in this region. The largest mass of silver obtained, up to this time, weighed more than six pounds. This was found at the Ph\u0153nix mine. Beautiful specimens of native silver, in Prehnite, have also been picked up on the beaches of Washington Harbor, Isle Royale. No ores of silver have been noticed in the trappean rocks. (Vide Part I, pp. 139, 173 and 178.) Silver, Sulphuret of. \u2014 This mineral occurs at the Prince mine, on the north shore of the lake ; we are not aware, however, that any ore of silver has been observed on the south side. Stilbite. \u2014 This mineral is found very sparingly, if at all, in the trappean rocks of Keweenaw Point. Sph\u0153rosiderite \u2014 Is found in amorphous masses, occupying the cavities of the greenstone of Keweenaw Point, resembling that from Hanau. Tabular-spar. \u2014 See Wollastonite. Talc. \u2014 Although this mineral constitutes a portion of the slaty rocks of the azoic series, it is rare to find any good specimens, or masses of any considerable size. Titanic iron sand. \u2014 Some of the sand, which occurs so abundantly along the shores of the lake, is titaniferous ; but, in general, the iron ores of this region are remarkably free from this metal. Uranium. \u2014 See Pitchblende. Wollastonite. \u2014 This mineral, or table-spar, as it is often called, occurs at the Cliff mine, and on Isle Royale, near Scovill's Point. Specimens from both those localities are identical in external characters, but differ much from the same mineral, as it occurs elsewhere ; so much so, indeed, that their real nature could only be learned by chemical analysis. The mineral, as it here occurs, is compact, of a light, flesh-red color, and remarkable for its exceeding toughness, surpassing in that quality anv mine ral, or rock known. Two analyses of this mineral, from the Cliff mine, gave as follows ' I. II. Silica - 49.09 49.06 Lime 46.38 44.87 Protoxide of manganese - .48 .93 Alumina .23 1.28 Magnesia .14 Water - 2.96 2.96 Carbonic acid and loss .72 - .90 100.00 100.00"], [389, "109 [ 4 ] This mineral is therefore a bi-silicate of lime, colored by a little man ganese. It receives a beautiful polish, and might be wrought for ornamental pur poses, if it occurred in sufficient quantity. Zinc. \u2014 Carbonate of zinc has been supposed to occur on Keweenaw Point, but this is an error. Blende, or sulphuret of zinc, occurs abundantly on the north shore, at the Prince mine, associated with calc-spar, sulphuret of silver, and sulphuret of copper. A small quantity of zinc has been observed at Presqu'isle. i"], [390, "[4] 110 CHAPTER VIII. LOWER SILURIAN SYSTEM\u2014 POTSDAM AND CALCIFEROUS SANDSTONES.

We now proceed to a description of the pal\u00e6ozoic series of this region. Unlike the rocks which we have hitherto described, they exhibit few traces of igneous outburst, and few displacements of the strata ; but, on the other hand, they repose nearly horizontally on the basset edges of the slates, or occupy the depressions in the granite. This general remark, however, must be received with some qualification, for we find that there existed, during a part of the Silurian epoch, at least two lines of volcanic foci, from which flowed numerous streams of lava. These, mingling with the detrital deposits, then in the progress of accumula tion, formed a mass, whose united thickness far surpasses the height of the loftiest summits in this region. We refer to the trap ranges of Keweenaw Point and Isle Royale, described in a previous report. The materials forming these rocks appear to have been deposited as sedi ments in the bottom of the ocean, enveloping the varjpus types of animal and vegetable life, which, by successive creations, started into being. From the commencement of this period, so far as we yet know, may be dated the"], [391, "[4] 111 dawn of animal life. At the base of the Potsdam sandstone, we reach the verge which separates the organic from the inorganic world. \" Here,\" in the language of another, \" our voyage, like that of the old, fabulous navi- gators of five centuries ago, terminates gn the sea, in a thick darkness, beyond which there lies no shore, and there dawns no light.\"* Starting then, from this point, we find but a few forms of organized existence repre- sented. As we ascend in the series, we meet with new tribes, new genera, and new species. Generation succeeds generation. Old forms disappear and are replaced by new, which, in their turn, become obsolete. The dura- tion of a single species comprehends an immense period of years; and, when we consider the numerous changes which have taken place in the different types, since first the Lingula and the Trilobite appeared in the Potsdam sand- stone, our thoughts are carried back to a period so remote that all ordinary modes of expression fail to convey an adequate idea of the lapse of time. The geologist represents periods of duration by millions of years, as the astronomer represents the distance of the fixed stars from the earth, by millions of miles. The limits of this oceanic basin are but imperfectly defined. It stretched east and west, from the shores of the Atlantic to the flanks of the Rocky mountains ; to the south, it extended beyond the Rio Grande, and north, to the Arctic ocean. Within this basin, the granite axes between Lake Superior and Lake Michigan, and between Lake Superior and Hudson's bay, rose above the waters of the Silurian sea. A large portion of North America is embraced within this oceanic bed, constituting its fairest and most productive tracts. The uplifting force, by which this sea-bottom was converted into land, must have been gradually applied; since the strata, for the most part, repose in a nearly horizontal position, and exhibit few marks of derangement. We meet with no moun tain chains, and no transverse valleys, except such as have been excavated by running water. The whole region is spread out in gently undulating plains; or, if ridges exist, they are due to accumulations of drift, or to the greater coherence between the particles in certain groups, which enabled them to resist the general denudation, which has everywhere left such mcontestible evidence of its action. From the MS. of Mr. Hall, we append some general remarks on the identity of the members of the Silurian groups, as developed in different parts' of this basin : \" The observations of the past season have served to show that nearly all the more important groups of the Silurian system extend uninterruptedly from the more easterly points, where they have been investigated, through the northern peninsula of Michigan, as far west as the Mississippi, and even beyond. These observations form a connecting link between those hereto fore made in New York and Canada, and those made in the southern penin sula of Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, and other portions of the West, and enable the geologist to form a correct idea of the range, extent, and fossil contents of these groups, as developed in the northern portion of the United States. We believe that these results will render some points of resemblance, heretofore obscure, clear and distinct ; and remove any doubts that may have been entertained, as to the identity of certain mem- bers of the Silurian system, in their eastern and western prolongation. If * Hugh Jiuler"], [392, "[4] 112 these results are attained, we shall be satisfied that we have not labored in vain. These strata, originally deposited in a wide ocean, every where present evidences of organic existence. _ It is not to be supposed that in tracing deposits of this kind over such wide areas, the conditions of the ocean shores would have been uniform in their physical character, and we cannot, therefore, expect uniformity in the character of the deposits themselves. The very circumstances under which the sediment was thrown down and the causes which gave origin to it, are of themselves evidence, a priori, that absolute uniformity could not prevail over so wide an area. We are to look, in like manner, for corresponding changes in organic remains. It cannot be supposed that animals, possessing certain characters and habits of hfe, would continue to live for any length of time, when the physical conditions were unfavorable to their existence. When we consider, also, the exter-t over which these deposits have been traced, the difference in longitude alone would lead us to expect some differences in the fauna of this ancient period. We have only to compare this great linear development of the pal\u00e6ozoic strata with an equal extent of modern coast, to form some idea of the changes that might be expected to occur under similar circum stances. In making such a comparison, however, we shall find that the actual condition of these ancient deposits is far more uniform than that of the sea-shore, or sea-bottom, at the present day. By making the preliminary examination of recent shores, or of recent geological deposits, we are far better prepared to appreciate and understand the changes which will be observed in the rocks themselves. These changes, though gradual, and readily understood, when studied continu ously, are, nevertheless, difficult of explanation, when seen at wide inter vals, or examined at distant localities. The general results of thesfc examinations, as will be seen by the loca \u25a0 details, have shown an increasing thickness in the Potsdam sandstone, in its western extension, though, at some of the intermediate points, it is much thinner than in New York. It should be recollected, however, that these beds were deposited upon the uneven surface of preexisting rocks, and their entire thickness may, therefore, be exposed only at some of the points where the originally unequal floor presents some of its elevations, and thus give an erroneous idea of its actual, entire thickness. The calciferous sand \u2022 stone, in like manner, appears to increase as traced from the eastern limits of the district westward, and on the Mississippi, attains a thickness equal to that which it has in New York. From all of the evidence, it would appear that these two groups, which are very intimately related to each other, have their most extreme tenuity somewhere near the northern extremity of the great arch, formed by the circuits of the older formations around the northern shores of lakes Huron and Michigan. From this point, they increase in thickness as traced to the east and to the west. On the other hand, the lower limestones \u2014 the Chazy, Birds-eye, Black river, and Trenton groups \u2014 appear to decrease gradually in thickness, as traced westwardly from the Mohawk valley, and the outlet of Lake Ontario, where they exist in great force. This fact is made very conspicuous, when their entire thickness, as developed in New York, is compared with that of the same groups on the northern side of lakes Huron and Michigan, where they contract to within a hundred feet and in some places even less. We have also evidence that they do not,"], [393, "[*1 113 like the preceding groups, increase in thickness, when traced into Wisconsin and across the Mississippi ; for there, they hardly attain a vertical range of fifty feet. Although over the entire area the identity of character' and the continuity of the beds are maintained, it is clear that the materials have continually undergone diminution, and that the formation, unless it has been supplied from other sources, will be found to die out. In the upper member of the Lower Silurian system, the Hudson-river group of New York, we have also a striking example of the marked change which a deposit is found to have undergone when traced over a considera ble area. In the district under consideration, it is clearly recognized throughout its whole extent, from Drummond's island to Green Bay, except wdiere it has been denuded, and the space occupied by lakes, or bays. This group, like the other members of the limestone series before alluded to, exhibits a diminution in its thickness, as traced westward],', and disappears, a short distance beyond the limits of the district. If we next consider the upper groups of the Silurian system, as displayed in this district, we find that, to a great extent, the reverse is true. Leaving out of view the Medina sandstone and the arenaceous portions of the Clin ton group, which are scarcely recognizable here, we find the succeeding lime stones much increased in thickness, and exhibiting no diminution, but rather an augmentation, as traced to the westward. From these general remarks, the reader will be prepared to understand the details given under each division of the series. It should be observed, however, in the outset, that the width of surface occupied on the map, by a particular group, is not always to be regarded as an indication of its thick ness ; for this, in most cases, is dependent upon the amount of dip in the beds, which, in this case, nearly corresponds with the slope of the country ; so that it often happens that a group, less than a hundred feet in thickness, forms a belt several miles in width. The bearing and inclination of these successive groups indicate that they formed the outer margin of a great geological basin, whose greatest depres sion is in the lower peninsula of Michigan, where the surface is occupied by rocks of the carboniferous epoch. It is only in a northern and north western direction, however, that we are enabled to trace the strata in a de scending order quite to the lowest members of the series, and even to the non-fossiliferous series beneath them. In other directions, we find the most elevated portions of the border exposing only members of the upper, or at most, of the middle, portion of the Silurian system.\" POTSDAM SANDSTONE. This was the first formed deposit in the Silurian basin, and attained, in its greatest development, a thickness of about two hundred and fifty feet, if we exolude the conglomerate-bands associated with the trap of Keweenaw Point and Isle Royale. Range and Extent. \u2014 The bed of Lake Superior, embracing an area of about 32,000 square miles, is occupied almost exclusively by this rock, if we may judge from the islands which dot its surface, and the isolated patches which occur along its shores. On the north, the granite ranges approach near the coast and confine the sandstone within narrow limits ; on the south, it occupies a broader area, and has been traced continuously around the"], [394, "[43 114 axis, which divides the waters respectively flowing into Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, and the Mississippi. While the granite ranges attain in places an elevation of 1200 feet above the lake, the sandstones, except in the vicinity of the trap, do not *each higher than 350 feet, and rest in a position nearly horizontal. Consequently, the granites and slates rise up like islands through this great waste of sandstone. This sandstone does not exhibit, at remote points, a homogeneity of cha- racter, or uniformity in thickness ; but appears to have been modified, to a great extent, by local causes. Thus, in the vicinity of the trappean rocks, which afford ample evidence of intense and long-continued volcanic agency, the beds attain the enormous thickness of 5000 feet, and often consist of conglomerates, composed of trappean pebbles, cemented by a volcanic sand. Away from these lines of disturbance, and where it abuts against the azoic rocks, the mass consists of nearly pure silicious sand, enveloping pebbles of quartz and patches of slate. Where granite forms the adjoining rock, an equally marked change is observed in the character of the pebbles. Since, therefore, the nature of the purely detrital rocks is influenced by the surrounding masses which formed the ancient land, it follows that litho- logical characters afford an uncertain criterion in determining their age, at points widely separated. Yet, we have seen distinguished geologists under- take to identify these rocks, simply from lithological characters, with the hunter sandstein* of Germany, with the new-red of England, and the trias of the Connecticut valley. Such a doctrine presupposes a universality of formations, \u2014 as though the same accumulations of silt and sand were taking place at the same time in opposite parts of the earth, \u2014 as though the volca- noes of different hemispheres were at the same time actively excited and poured forth the same igneous products. Such a doctrine is repugnant to all of our preconceived notions. It finds no confirmation in the history of the past, and no agreement with the existing order of things. The doctrine of the universal ity of formations receives less conformation the more the structure of the ea.rth is investigated. The sandstone which rests at the base of the Silurian s ystem in the Baltic and Russian provinces, according to Murchison and de V erneuil, is slightly coherent and in a nearly horizontal position. In the vicinity of St. Petersburgh, the oldest beds of this system consist of blue clay, the several members differing but little in external aspect from the tertiary and cretaceous rocks which are spread out. around the estuaries of many parts of Europe. The old-red sandstone, in many places, is colorless, and presents great diversity in mineral composi tion. The Potsdam sandstone of New York is a quartzose rock, whose particles are firmly aggregated, while the same rock, on the northern slope of Lake Michigan, is so slightly coherent, that it may be crushed in the hand. The calciferous sandstone of New Yo rk, when traced west, passes into a mag nesian limestone. Even in that state, according to Hall, groups which, at one extremity, are of great importance, and well characterized by fossils, cannot be identified at the other. The great mass of the materials which form the sandstones of this region appears to have been derived from the north-west, since the beds there attain a much greater thickness, and are composed of coarser sediments. They thin out as we trace them south and east, and are charged with fewer \u2022 Dr. Owen's Report, 1847-18, p. 57. Dr. Jackson's Report, 1849-50, p. 899."], [395, "115 [4] pebbles. On the Atlantic slope, according to the Messieurs Rogers, the sandstones expand in their south-easterly prolongation, while the limestones decrease. Hence, the ancient land was to the south-east and north-west, while the intervening space which formed the ocean bed, is occupied by the pal\u00e6ozoic series. SANDSTONES OF THE NORTHERN SHORE. On the northern shore of the lake, as before remarked, the sandstone occurs in insulated patches. According to Mr. Logan, to whom we are largely indebted for our knowledge of she geology of this portion of the region, on the isthmus between Thunder and Black Bays, sandstone occurs composed of white, silicious particles, but occasionally calcareous grains aro intermingled. These beds attain a thickness of at least two hundred feet, and are succeeded by beds of red and white, in alternating layers. Con glomerates, containing pebbles of coarse red jasper, held in a reddish-white, or greenish sand, are also interstratified. The upper portion of the beds contains more calcareous matter, and some of the conglomerates envelope patches of limestone and chert. Mr. Logan estimates their entire thickness at five hundred feet. They are succeeded by limestones of a reddish-white color and very compact, interstratified with calcareo-argillaceous shales and reiidish- white sandstones, \u2014 the whole attaining a thickness of eighty feet, w'th an addition of fifty feet of reddish, indurated marl. Succeeding these calcareous strata, after an interval, the amount of which is uncertain, red an. I white sandstones occur, with conglomerate layers, which become interstiatified with trap layers, and an enormous amount of a volcanic over flow ciowns the formation. The extremity of Thunder cape is occupied by the older slates and the associated ignetfus rocks ; but Mr. Logan observed, about six miles to the eastward, a transverse dislocation, which lets down the sandstone at least 1300 feet, bringing it suddenly to occupy the coast in the strike of the slates. On the north side of the bay, the conglomerate is seen to rest in a nearly horizontal position upon the highly tilted chloritic slates, and in one spot, it evenly covers over, without any disturbance, a step in the slates produced by an ancient transverse fault. The sandstones rise in vertical cliffs to the height of two hundred feet, and occupy the coast for the dis tance of seven miles. The limestones and marls start from a point about a mile an! a half east of the down-throw, and run parallel with the sand stones, dipping south-east at an angle of about 3\u00b0. At Granite islet, a con glomerate, composed of granitic ruins, is seen occupying the inequalities and worn fissures of the supporting rock, and displaying a southern dip of about .< \u25a0\". The n ore volcanic portion, consisting of grits and conglomerates, inter stratified with trap layers, commences at Point Porphyry ; and, forming a belt from seven to ten miles wide, stretches in a N.N.E. direcction, em bracing not only a portion of the main-land, but St. Ignace and Simpson's islands.* We examined this volcanic formation, as displayed along the western shore of Neepigon bay and on the island of St. Ignace, and found its geo- * Canada Report. 1846-7."], [396, "i 4] 116 logical structure identical with that of Isle Royale and Keweenaw Point. The pebbles consist almost entirely of trappean rocks, and the interstratified igneous beds are aften highly amygdaloidal and contain traces of native copper, which is one of the characteristics of this formation. On the eastern side of the lake, (again quoting the authority of Mr. Lo- gan,) insular patches of sandstone, and also of volcanic products, reappear. About two miles north of Cape Choyye, a coarse-grained bed abuts against a precipitous cliff of the older formations, and dips to the south of west at an angle of 10\u00b0. At Gargantua, and on some of the adjacent islands, amygdaloidal trap is observed, in beds dipping 40\u00b0 to the south of west. Caribou, Leach, Lizard and Montreal islanels, consist of sandstone, the beds of which are but slightly inclined. The amygdaloidal trap and sand- stone occupy the lower side of the cove above Pointe aux Mines, and the promontory of Mamainse is composed of amygdaloidal trap and coarse con- glomerates, made up of the ruins of the subjacent granite, syenite and slate \u2014 the whole dipping to the south of west, at an angle of 20\u00b0 or 25\u00b0. Sandstones compose the promontory between L'Anse aux Crepes and Batcheewauaung bay, and the coast around Goulais bay, with the exception of a limited space occupied by the amygdaloidal trap, and thence extend in a narrow strip for seven miles, as we advance towards Gros Cap, dipping gently to the north-west. Isle Royale wa,s formed eluring this epoch, and owes its origin to sub- marine, volcanic agency. The main mass. is traversed by numerous ridges of bedded trap, of unequal hardness, while the coast is intersected by deep passages, or fiords, like those of Iceland and Norway.* They undoubtedly originated during the drift epoch, for we know that the waves of the sea, as manifested along the coast at this day, are incapable of such excavating power. Over the whole surface of the island, we meet with numerous evidences of powerful denudation. The rocks have been ground down, polished, and striated, and nearly all of the superficial materials removed. * Mr. Dana has called attention to the important fact of the frequent existence of these fiords in the higher latitudes, aud their almost total absence from coasts in the lower tempe rate and torrid zones. \" Along the west coast of America, they abound, to the north above 48\u00b0 ; and to the south, in Lower Patagonia and Ticrra del Fuego, south of 48\u00b0, there ave similar passages intersecting the land, and often cutting it into islands ; but between these limits the coast has few bays, and fewer still of these channel-like indentations. On the eastern coast of the continent, we observe the same general fact. To the north of the equator, the coast is singularly even in its outline, until we reach Maine, north of latitude 43\u00b0, where, as may be seen on a good map, the fiords become very numerous, and deep and complex in their long windings and ramifications. The same remarks will apply to the eastern continent. The fiords of Norway are well known, and this coast is a singular con trast to that of France, Spain and Africa.\" \u2014 [Geology of the Exploring Expedition, p. 675.] They appear to be intimately connected with the drift phenomena, being the most abundant where the drift action is most conspicuously displayed, and ceasing altogether before arriving at the extreme limits of the boulders. The rocks bordering these fiords are ground down, polished, and scratched, and, in many cases, covered with rudely stratified beds of sand, pebbles, &c, which must have been accumulated when the land was submerged. The fiords are probably due to causes which have ceased to operate, since the present action of the sea is to fill up the sheltered bays, and wear away the projecting capes. Their existence, too, results, in a great measure, from the geological structure of the region where they occur, as we have shown in Part I. of our report. Where the rocks are of uniform hardness, we meet with gently-curving shores and wide-mouthed bays : but, where there are alternating bands of unequal hardness, we meet with numerous projecting head-lands and deeply-indented coves. Rocks of this character prevail, north and south, between the equator and latitude 48\u00b0 ; but the causes by which their denudation was effected, do not appear to have operated within these limits. Wo must, therefore, look to other sources than the action of the sea as manifested at this day."], [397, ""], [398, ".r.e l AcV^rjnar. idi 379 Bxoadbiray -W I I , MU\"M\u00a3NT ROCK (\"NORTH EAST VIEW ISLE ROYALE"], [399, ""], [400, "MONUMENT ROCK (TRONT VIEW ) ISLE ROYALE"], [401, ""], [402, "Ackerman Li.YK.379 Broadway. NY \"THE CASTLES\""], [403, "[4] 117 In some instances, isolated blocks remain as obelisks to remind us of the extent of the desolation. The sketches, marked Plate IL, III., represent the \"Monument Rocks,\" which occur on a bold headland known as Blake's Point, near the eastern extremity of the island. The ridge here is, perhaps, two hundred and fifty feet above the lake, and the rocks shoot up nearly seventy feet. Their sym metrical and tower-like forms, aided by the different systems of joints, which intersect the trappean mass at nearly right angles, cutting it into rectangular blocks, render it one of the most interesting objects on the lake coast. The summit of these rocks, as seen from below, seems entirely inaccessible, and yet we believe that it has once been attained by a daring, and, we might almost add, fool-hardy, climber. From the ridge a short distance to the north, which overlooks Duncan's bay, and is about three hundred feet above Lake Superior, the eye sweeps over the whole region. Rock Harbor, sheltered by a narrow chain of islands, is seen below, beyond which the lake spreads out in a broad sheet, without an object to obstruct the gaze. To the north and west, Thunder c; pe, McKay's mountain, and Pie island, stand out in bold relief, and the outline of the Canada shore can be traced for more than a hundred miles, while to the south, in clear weather, the forms of the hills on Keweenaw Point are indistinctly seen. Along the southern border of the island, we meet with narrow bands of conglomerate interposed between the igneous masses, succeeded by layers of red sandstone, somewhat fissile, the whole dipping to the S.S.E. at an angle, in some cases, of 30\u00b0. SANDSTONE OF THE SOUTHERN SHORE. Between Keweenaw Point and Isle Royale, there is, as we have before remarked, an immense curvature of the strata, probably reaching five hun dred feet below the ocean level. A narrow belt of conglomerate and sand stone lines nearly the whole southern coast, from the head of Keweenaw Point to the Montreal river, beyond which, the latter, no longer associated with coarser bands, rapidly expands in width, and continues to Fond du Lac. For the most part, it appears in low ledges, or reefs, along the lake shore, but, at a few points, it rises in vertical cliffs, which afford many scenes of great beauty. The sketch (Plate IV), entitled \"The Castles,\" repre sents the sandstone as it appears a sew miles above the portage \u2014 a locality which we have particularly described in a former report. The bedded trap and conglomerate are admirably exhibited on Keweenaw Point, and in many places in the Ontonagon district ; but as we have mi nutely described the geographical distribution of all the trappean rocks of this era with the associated conglomerate and sandstone, in a former report, a further description is deemed unnecessary. Where the Bohemian range breaks through the sandstone, the strata on the north side of the axis are observed to dip at an angle of 45\u00b0, while on the south the clip is 70\u00b0. A few miles removed, southerly, they settle down nearly horizontally, or present a series of long and gentle flexures. From a highly broken region \u2014 the hills rising abruptly to an altitude of nine hundred feet \u2014 the country at once sinks down into comparatively level"], [404, "[ 4 ] 118 plains. The sketch of Mt. Houghton from the Bohemian range may serve to illustrate the topography of this portion of the region. (Plate V.) Between the trap range, and the granite and slate region, there is a valley eighty miles in length and twenty in breadth, mainly occupied by sandstone ; but a few isolated patches of the lower limestones remain as monuments to determine the age of their deposition and remind the geologist of the extent of the subsequent denudation. These were fully described in our former report, as well as the organic remains entombed in them. Extensive de posits of clay prevail throughout this valley, so that the subjacent rock is rarely exposed. One of the best exposures, however, of the junction of the trap and sandstone, along the southern slope of the axis, occurs in the gorge of Trap-rock river, she trap here rises in a mural cliff, eighty feet in height, intersected by different planes of cleavage, which give to it a stratiform appearance. Over this, the stream is precipitated by a succession of leaps into a rocky basin below, and thence flows through a gorge lined on either side by walls of sandstone. (Plate VI.) At the point of junc tion the trap assumes an amygdaloidal appearance and a brick-red color, and some portions possess s slaty cleavage. Higher up, however, it becomes more compact, resembling greenstone. The sandstone differs from that which occurs on the northern slope, being granular and almost wholly com posed of silicious particles, intermingled with pebbles of pure-white quartz and patches of dove-colored slate or clay. Over most of this district, the sandstone rests in a nearly horizontal posi tion ; but we have shown that it has been subject to disturbances over limited areas. Along the shores of Keweenaw Bay, it rises in cliffs of coiv siderable height, and the strata present a succession of gentle undulations. As we approach L'Anse, the dip to the north-west becomes apparent. Near the head of the bay, the sandstone is seen reposing unconformably on the slates of the azoic system, leaving no doubt that both groups belong to dis tinct geological epochs, and were produced under conditions widely different. (Vide plate XXI., figure 1.) Its external characters and its relations to the slates have been described in the chapter relating to the azoic system. The projecting spit forming Point Abbaye, on the eastern side of Kewee naw Bay, is of this rock, and cliffs from twenty to thirty feet in height skirt the shore, while low reefs are seen near the water's edge. The sandstone, in numerous places, exhibits a stratification like that re presented in the annexed figure. (Fig. 11.) Fig. 11. Example of Diagonal Stratification. This stratification, having first been observed in the bed of the Rhone, was called stratification torrentielle; but is now known as diagonal, or cross stratification. It is found to pervade the detrital rocks, from the recent alluvial deposits to the sandstones of the Silurian system. From the nume rous examples of diagonal and horizontal stratification afforded by the"], [405, "Elate V Arltmnsnliih 37C .J, natiw-\u00ab V ', Ms) II NT HOUGHTON, 1AC LA BELLI"], [406, ""], [407, "Plate.Vl TRAP ROCK RIVER"], [408, ""], [409, "SECTION ot Folded Nirdia atl'Anse AND SANDSTONE. 3\u00b0 CHLORITE AND SILICIOUS SLATE 4*4 TRAPPED KOCKS 5\u00b0 5\" TRAP DYKES 6\u00b0 6\u00b0 LINES OP DIVISION Fi\u00b02 'iJJalural Size Fig3. \u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0 .\u25a0 ' ' \u25a0 . ,'i\".:;L ' !

Thus, in the above section, taken at Point Abbaye, the beds 1, 3 and 5, appear to have been deposited from materials mechanically suspended ; while the materials composing the beds 2 and 4, were drifted by oceanic or tidal currents. Again, it would appear that the current, which drifted the materials of bed 2, set in a different direction from that which formed the bed 4. To= account for these phenomena it is not necessary to suppose that there were sudden oscillations of the land ; they are such as might result from the shifting of tidal currents, or even of the surface winds. The import ance of these facts, as indicating a shoal bottom, will be commented upon, under another head. In some instances where the observer saw only a diagonally stratified bed, he might mistake for local disturbance, what, in fact was the result of tranquil deposition. East of Huron bay, the sandstone forms a narrow belt, rarely exceeding three miles in width, along the lake shore, and abuts against the slates and granites on the south. Numerous small veins, or rather joints, containing green carbonate and grey sulphuret of copper have been observed in ranges 29 and 30, by the lake shore, some of which, in the early days of copper mining, were ex plored, but proved of no economical value. They bear N.N.E., coinciding with one of the systems of joints which here prevail. Occasionally, as for example, near the head of Huron bay, a knob of hornblende is seen rising above the surrounding country, with the sandstone abutting against its base, in nearly horizontal strata. At Garlic river, and probably at the Huron river, the continuity of the sandstone is interrupted \u2014 the older rocks forming for some distance the coast line. Granite Point affords one of the most interesting and instructive sections to be found along the whole coast of Lake Superior. A dome-shaped Fig. 12.

Dykes of greenstone (3) traverse the nucleus, but in no case penetrate the over lying rock.

The sandstone here is dark-red and divided into numerous layers, through which are distributed numerous white, circular blotches, \u2014 a peculiarity which has been noticed, at intervals, from the head of Keweenaw Point to Saut Ste. Marie. They vary from half an inch to an inch in diameter, and often enclose a dark speck in the centre. They are found to be spheres, instead of superficial films, and differ in no respect in structure from the en closing mass, except that the coloring matter, which consists of peroxide of iron, is driven off. The dark spot in the centre may be the remains of some organic substance, which, in the process of decomposition, has dis charged the coloring matter in the immediate vicinity. Mr. Miller has described similar blotches as occurring in the old red-sand stone of Scotland. \"In a print-work, the whole web is frequently thrown into a vat and dyed one color ; but there afterwmrds comes a discharging process. Some chemical mixture is dropped on the fabric; the dye disap pears wherever the mixture touches ; and in leaves and sprigs and patches, according to the printer's pattern, the cloth assumes its original white.

The discharging agent was organic matter ; the uncolored patches are no mere surface films, for, when cut at right angles, their depth is found to corre spond with their breadth ; the circle is a sphere, the ellipsis forms the sec tion of an egg-shaped body, and in the centre of each we generally find traces of the organism, in whose decay it originated. I have repeatedly found single scales in the ichthyolite beds, surrouneled by uncolored spheres about the size of musket-bullets.\"* Thin bands of conglomerate, charged with pebbles of white and yellow quartz, occur at frequent intervals, and occasionally angular fragments of granite, derived from the immediate neighborhood, are observed. On the main shore, the granite rises in an abrupt hill, two or three hundred feet in height, and stretches away inland, while the sandstone is folded around its base in nearly horizontal strata ; so that there is no doubt that the latter formation was deposited in an erosion of the former. Under such circum stances, we might expect that there would be waves and shifting currents and eddies, which, acting upon the incoherent mass of sand, would cause the subordinate layers to be deposited unconformably with the main ones. From all of the facts, we infer that the following was the order in the succession of events : 1. That the granite was raised, and its ancient surface water-worn, before the deposition of the sandstone. 2. That the dykes of greenstone were protruded before the deposition of the sandstone. 3. That the sandstone was deposited over an unequal surface, amid shift ing currents and eddies, giving rise to cross-stratification. 4. That one system of fissures communicating with the interior, was formed more recently than the sandstone, and that, through them, the gases escaped, bleaching the overlying rocks. Fig. 14.

A bold promontory (2) juts into the water, consisting of a dark-colored ferruginous and magnesian rock, evidently trappean in its origin, although it contains nearly ten per cent, of water. (For an analysis of this rock, see chapter on the chemical composition of the igneous rocks). It rises in overhanging cliffs, which occasionally as sume a columnar structure. The outline of this mass is very irregular, and * Old Red Sandstone, p. 234, American Edition. Also, Professor Flemming in Cheek's Edinburgh Journal, 1831."], [414, "[ 4 ] 122 resembles an immense consolidated lava-stream, except that the vesicular structure is wanting. To the north, the surface of the igneous rock is bare ; but, on the eastern side, it is covered in places with a rudely stratified mass, which appears to have been deposited in the inequalities of the preexisting surface. It resembles a volcanic sand, or ash, portions of it being com posed of a scoriaceous mass of a light-brown color, and reticulated with numerous veins of a white mineral, portions of which are calcareous, and others silicious. In some instances, these reticulations penetrate to a limited extent the underlying rock ; but, for the most part are restricted to the ash. This attains, in places, a thickness of seventy or eighty feet, but is very unequally distributed. On the west side of Presqu'isle, at the point of contact between the igneous and sedimentary (pluto-neptunian) rocks, their character is com pletely changed, and they have become impregnated with metallic emana tions from below. The sulphurets of lead, copper, and iron, occur- here in small quantities in a pseudo-vein, while the containing rock exhibits a strong tendency towards a concretionary structure. Above the last described deposit, we meet with the sandstone in nearly horizontal layers. From its base upward, for six feet, it contains rounded fragments of quartz and granite, with angular fragments of agate and jasper. The prevailing tint of the rock is dark-red ; and, intermingled with the silicious particles, are to be seen minute spangles of specular oxide of iron. Higher up, the layers exhibit a yellow tint. Traces of green carbonate of copper are abundant ; in fact, they pervade this rock from the Huron mountains to the Grand Sable. At Middle island, the sandstone is seen reposing on the granite with an inclination of 7\u00b0 to the S.E. Below Little Presqu'isle, it is occasionally detected forming reefs by the lake shore, abutting against the older rocks. A patch, less than a half mile in width, extends from the shore up the valley of Carp river for two miles, enclosed between high walls of quartzose rocks. It was observed by Mr. Hill in the bed of the stream and in the ad joining banks to the height of seventy feet. Insulated patches are never met with at a greater elevation than three hundred and fifty feet above the lake, and hence we infer that the more elevated portions of the granites and slates rose above the surface of the ocean in which the sandstone was deposited. If this was not the case, we should expect to find traces of it in the sheltered valleys ; for we cannot conceive of an abrasion so thorough and effectual as to sweep away the overlying strata, without leaving behind even a block or pebble. The barometrical observations extended over this region by the two corps, when collated, will enable us to determine the contours of this ancient island which rose above the surface, when a wide waste of waters covered nearly all of the habitable portions of the United States. A short distance below Carp river, the sandstone is again exposed by the lake shore, in contact with quartz. The latter rock exhibits ripple-marked surfaces and distinct lines of bedding which bear east and west and dip south at an angle of 86\u00b0. The surface of the quartz, where the sandstone is removed, is rounded and polished like that of the granite before described, and it is only where the lake surge has undermined the cliff that the true character of the mass is revealed. While the more ancient beds are thus displayed in a nearly vertical"], [415, "123 [4] position, the more recent are seen deposited around them nearly horizontally Their relations to each other are exhibited in the accompanying diagram, Fig. 15. Section near Carp river. a. a. Sandstone horizontally stratified. I. b. Beds of quartz nearly vertical In one place, the sandstone has been deposited in a wide fissure in the quartz, resembling the matrix of a vein. Upon the surfaces of the quartz are seen wave-lines, as though made by. water at the period of its deposi tion. This vicinity affords conclusive evidence that the sandstone has been subjected to repeated oscillatory movements since its consolidation; for, where it comes in contact with the preexisting rocks, the ends of the strata are ground off and polished, like the walls of a vein. Dislocations in the strata ten feet in a vertical direction were observed, and also, instances where they were bent up and broken off; but at what period these took place, we have no means of determining. Beyond Chocolate river, the coast is lined for some distance with sand dunes ; but the sandstone is occa sionally seen at the water's edge, in low ledges, or reefs, and is undoubtedly the underlying rock as far as Saut Ste. Marie, occupying a zone from six to twenty miles in width. Another portion of it starts from Chocolate river, and, sweeping round the granitic and metamorphic rocks, but con forming to their outlines, crosses the Escanaba and Menomonee rivers, and is thence prolonged into Wisconsin. Here, its trend for some distance is parallel with the western coast of lake Michigan, when, curving rapidly, it bears north and connects with the Lake Superior sandstone near the head of the lake. We resume our description of the character of the sandstone, as dis played along the south-eastern shore of Lake Superior. From the head of Grand island, and thence easterly for ten miles, it rises from the immediate coast in bold, mural cliffs, extending not in a direct line, but en echelon \u2014 certain portions of the wall being in advance of the others. The forest trees, which consist of birch, maple, cedar, and spruce, cover the summits to the very verge, and, occasionally, a stream of water is seen to issue from"], [416, "[41 124 the leafy canopy, and precipitate itself, with- an unbroken leap, into the lake. The lower portion of the cliffs consists of a brick-red, iron sand, while the upper is grey, or yellow, and contains sufficient carbonate of lime to cause a feeble effervescence with acids. The whole mass is distinctly stra tified, and dips slightly to the south-south-east. This is not so apparent on the main shore, where the trend of the lake and the strike of the strata are nearly conformable ; but, in approaching Grand island from the north-east, where the strata are for miles exposed, not only longitudinally, but trans versely, this south-south-east dip is clearly displayed. Grand island affords one of the most beautiful and sheltered harbors in the world. In approaching it from the east, the voyageur passes along the base of the cliffs before described, which form an immense sea-wall, and oppose the further encroachments of the water. (Plate VII.) Having passed a projecting hook, he finds himself within a harbor completely land locked, with secure anchorage, and a depth of water sufficient to enable him to moor his craft within a few lengths of the shore. These rocks, at many points, are tinted white, red, yellow, and green, by oxide of iron, carbonate of copper, and saline incrustaticms, and the tints extend upward, from the water's edge, in broad stripes, not dull and blended, but brilliant and well-defined. When the whole face of a cliff is lighted up by a clear sunlight, the effect is magical. The water flowing from above, down the transverse fissures, has furrowed the escarpments of the cliff into deep channels, while the heavy surf of the lake has excavated numerous caverns in its base. Thus, by the combined action of the elements, these rocks have been wrought into forms resembling towers, battlements, domes, and gateways. PICTURED ROCKS. The range of cliffs, to which the name of the Pictured Rocks has been given, may be regarded as among the most striking and beautiful features of the scenery of the north-west, and are well worthy of the attention of the artist, of the lover of the grand and beautiful, and of the observer of geological phenomena. Although occasionally visited by travellers, a full and accurate descrip tion of this extraordinary locality has not as yet been communicated to the public* This deficiency we shall attempt to supply, partly by written descrip tions, and partly by a series of illustrations, which, however deficient in artistic effect, have, we believe, the merit of being careful copies from Schoolcrast has undertaken to describe this range of cliffs, and illustrate the scenery. The sketches do not appear to have been made on the spot, or finished by one who was acquainted with the scenery, as they bear no resemblance, so far as we observed, to any of the prominent features of the Pictured Rocks. On the title-page of his narrative, he has figured the \" Doric Rock,\" but it is impossible for us to make out what particular point it was intended to represent. It is a matter of surprise that, so far as we know, none of our artists have visited this region, and given to the world representations of scenery so striking, and so different from any which can be found elsewhere. We can hardly conceive of anything more worthy of the artist's pencil ; and, if the tide of pleasure-travel should once be turned in this direc tion, it seems not unreasonable to suppose that a fashionable hotel may yet be built under the shade of the pine groves, near the Chapel, and a trip thither become as common as one to Niagara now is."], [417, "L':iT.ri-;A)u.i', in l,kahij kjlanh harhor I"], [418, ""], [419, "125 [4] nature. Though necessarily on a small scale, they convey a correct general idea of the most striking and characteristic features of the scenery. The Pictured Rocks may be described, in general terms, as a series of sandstone bluffs extending along the shore of Lake Superior for about five miles, and rising, in most places, vertically from the water, without any beach at the base, to a height varying from fifty to nearly two hundred feet. Were they simply a line of cliffs, they might not, so far as relates to height or extent, be worthy of a rank among great natural curiosities, although such an assemblage of rocky strata, washed by the waves of the great lake, would not, under any circumstances, be destitute of grandeur. To the voyager, coasting along their base in his frail canoe, they would, at all times, be an object of dread; the recoil of the surf, the rock-bound coast, affording, for miles, no place of refuge, \u2014 the lowering sky, the rising wind ; all these would excite his apprehension, and induce him to ply a vigorous oar until the dreaded wall was passed. But, in the Pictured Rocks, there are two features which communicate to the scenery a wonder ful and almost unique character. These are, first, the curious manner in which the cliffs have been excavated, and worn away by the action of the lake, which, for centuries, has dashed an ocean-like surf against their base ; and, second, the equally curious manner in which large portions of the sur face have been colored by bands of brilliant hues. It is from the latter circumstance that the name, by which these cliffs are known to the American traveller, is derived ; while that applied to them by the French voyageurs (\" Les Portails\"*) is derived from the former, and by far the most striking peculiarity. The term Pictured Rocks, has been in use for a great length of time ; but when it was first applieel, we have been unable to discover. It would Seem that the first travellers were more impressed with the novel and striking distribution of colors on the surface, than with the astonishing Variety of form into which the cliffs themselves have been worn. The Indian name applied to these cliffs, according to our voyageurs, is Schkuee-archibi-kung, or \" The end of the rocks,\" which seems to refer to the fact that, in descending the lake, after having passed them, no more rocks are seen along the shore. Our voyageurs had many legends to relate of the pranks of the Menni-bojou in these caverns, and, in answer to our inquiries, seemed disposed to fabricate stories, without end, of the achieve ments of this Indian deity. We will describe the most interesting points in the series, proceeding from west to east. On leaving Grand island harbor,! high cliffs are seen to the * Le Portail is a French term, signifying the principal entrance of a church, or a portal, and this name was given to the Pictured Rocks by the voyageurs, evidently in allusion to the arched entrances which constitute the most characteristic feature. Le Grand Portail is the great archway, or grand portal. t The traveller, desirous of visiting this scene, should take advantage of one of the pro pellers which navigate the lake, and land at Grand island, from which he can proceed to make the tour of the interesting points, in a small boat. The large vessels on the lake do not approach sufficiently near the cliffs to allow the traveller to gather more than a general idea of their position and outlines. To be able to appreciate and understand their extraor dinary character, it is indispensable to coast along in close proximity to the cliffs, and pass beneath the Grand Portal, which is only accessible from the lake, and to land and enter within the precincts of the Chapel. At Grand island, boats, men, and provisions may be procured. The traveller should lay in a good supply, if it is intended to be absent long enough to make a thorough examination of the whole-series. In fact, an old voyager will not readily trust himself to the mercy of the winds and waves of the lake without them, as he"], [420, "[4] 126 east, which form the commencement of the series of rocky promontories, represented in Plate VII., before referred to, which rise 'vertically from the water to the height of from one hundred to one hundred and twenty-five feet, covered with a dense canopy of foliage. Occasionally, a small cas cade may be seen falling from the verge to the base in an unbroken curve, or gliding down the inclined face of the cliff in a sheet of white foam. The rocks at this point begin to assume fantastic shapes ; but it is not, until having reached Miners' river, that their striking peculiarities are observed. Here, the coast makes an abrupt turn to the eastward, and just at the point where the rocks break off and the friendly sanel-beach begins, is seen one of the grandest works of nature in her rock-built architecture. This is re presented in Plate VIII., and, as we could not learn that it had received a distinctive appellation, we gave to it the name of \"Misters' Castle,\" from its sino-ular resemblance to the turreted entrance and arched portal of some old castle \u2014 for instance, that of Dumbarton. An inspection of the plate will exhibit the principal features more correctly than an elaborate written description. The height of the advancing mass, in which the form of the Gothic gateway may be recognized, is about seventy feet, while that of the main wall forming the background is about one hundred and forty. The appearance of the openings at the base changes rapidly with each change in the position of the spectator. On taking a position a little farther to the right of that occupied by the sketcher, the central opening appears more distinctly flanked on either side by two lateral passages, making the resem blance to an artificial work still more striking. A little farther east, Miners' river enters the lake, close under the brow of the cliff, which here sinks down and gives place to a sand-bank nearly a third of a mile in extent. The river is so narrow, that it requires no small skill oh the part of the voyager to enter its mouth when a heavy sea is rolling in from the north. On the right bank, a sandy drift plain, covered with Norway and Banksian pine, spreads out, affording good camping ground \u2014 the only place of refuge to the voyager until he reaches Chapel river, five miles distant, if we except a small sand beach about midway be tween the two points, where, in case of necessity, a boat may be beached. Beyond the sand beach at Miners' river, the cliffs attain an altitu.le of one hundred and seventy-three feet, and maintain a nearly uniform height for a considerable distance. Here, one of those cascades of which we have before spoken, is seen foaming down the rock. The cliffs do not form straight lines, but rather arcs of circles, the space between the projecting points having been worn out in symmetrical curves, some of which are of large dimensions. To one of the grandest and most regularly formed, we Eave the name of \" The Amphitheatre ;\" this is represented in Plate IX. looking to the west, another projecting point \u2014 its base worn into cave like forms \u2014 and a portion of the concave surface of the intervening space are seen. It is in this portion of the series, that the phenomena of colors are most beautifully and conspicuously displayed. These cannot be illustrated by a mere crayon sketch, but would require, to reproduce the natural effect, an elaborate drawing on a large scale, in which the various combinations of may not unfrequently, however auspicious the weather when starting, find himself weather- Dound for days together. It is possible, however, in one day, to start from Grand island, see the most interesting points, and return. The distance from \"Williams's to the Chapel the farthest point of interest \u2014 is about fifteen miles."], [421, "Plate VIII. MINERS' CASTLE- PICTURE D ROCKS Acker-nan T.nli T.'H Kru...l^ .

These colors, do not, by any means, cover the whole surface of the cliff even where they are most conspicuously displayed, belt are confined to certain portions of the cliffs in the vicinity of the Amphitheatre ; \u2014 the great mass of the surface presenting the natu ral, light-yellow, or raw-sienna, color of the rock. The colors are also limited in their vertical range, rarely extending more than thirty or forty feet above the water, or a quarter, or a third, of the vertical height of the cliff. The prevailing tints consist of deep-brown, yellow and grey \u2014 burnt sienna and French-grey predominating. There are also, bright blues and greens, though less frequent. All of the tints are fresh, brilliant and dis tinct, and harmonize admirably with one another, which, taken in connec tion with the grandeur of the arched and caverned surfaces on which they are laid, and the deep and pure green of the water which heaves and swells at the base, and the rich foliage which waves above, produce an effect truly wonderful. They are not scattered indiscriminately over the surface of the rock, but are arranged in vertical and parallel bands, extending to the water's edge. The mode of their production is undoubtedly as follows : Between the bands, or strata, of thick-bedded sandstone, there are thin seams of shaly materials which are more or less charged with the metallic oxides, iron largely pre- dominating, with here and there a trace of copper. As the surface-water permeates through the porous strata, it comes in contact with these shaly bands, and, oozing out from the exposed edges, trickles down the face of the cliffs and leaves behind a sediment, colored according to the oxide which is contained in the band in which it originated. It cannot, however, be denied that there are some peculiarities which it is difficult to explain by any hypothesis. On first examining the Pictured Rocks, we were forcibly struck with the brilliancy and beauty of the colors, and wondered why some of our predeces- sors, in their descriptions, had hardly adverted to what we regarded as their most characteristic feature. At a subsequent visit, we were sur- prised to find that the effect of the colors was much less striking than be- fore ; they seemed faded out, leaving only traces of their former brilliancy, so that the traveller might regard this as an unimportant feature in the scenery. It is difficult to account for this change, but it may be due to the dryness or humidity of the season. If the colors are produced by the percolation of the water through the strata, taking up and depositing the colored sediments, as before suggested, it is evident that a long period of drought would cut off the supply of moisture, and the colors, being no longer renewed, would faele and finally disappear. This explanation seems reasonable, for at the time of our second visit, the beds of the streams on the summit of the table-land were dry. It is a curious fact, that the colors are so firmly attached to the surface that they are very little affected by rains, or the dashing of the surf, since they were, in numerous instances, observed extending in all their freshness, to thei very water's edge. Proceeding to the eastward of the Amphitheatre, we find the cliffs scooped out into caverns, and grotesque openings, of the most striking and beautiful variety of forms. In some places, huge blocks of sandstone have become dislodged, and accumulated at the base of the cliff, where they are ground up, and the fragments borne away, by the ceaseless action of the surge."], [426, "[4] 128 A striking group of detached blocks is represented in Plate X. To this, the name of \" Sail Rock\" has been given from its striking resemblance to the jib and mainsail of a sloop when spread \u2014 so much so, that, when viewed from a distance, with a full glare of light upon it, while the cliff in the rear is left in the shade, the illusion is perfect. This is represented in Plate XI. but, unfortunately, the lithographer has thrown a shade over both cliff and sail. The height of the block is about forty feet. Masses of rock are frequently dislodged from the cliff, if we may judge from the freshness of the fracture, and the appearance of -the trees involved in the descent. The rapidity with which this undermining process is carried on, at many points, will be readily appreciated, when we consider that the cliffs do not form a single, unbroken line of wall ; but, on the contrary, they present numerous salient angles to the full force of the waves. A projecting corner is undermined until the superincumbent weight becomes too great, the overhanging mass cracks, and, aided perhaps by the power of frost, gradually becomes loosened, and finally topples, with a crash, into the lake. The same general arched and broken line of cliffs borders the coast for a mile to the eastward of Sail Rock, where the most imposing feature' in the series is reached. This is the Grand Portal \u2014 Le Grand Portail of the voyageurs. The annexed Plate, No. XII., is a representation of this arch, though it conveys but an imperfect idea of its vastness and grandeur. The general disposition of the arched openings, which traverse this great quadri lateral mass, may, perhaps, be made intelligible without the aid of a ground plan. The main body of the structure consists of a vast mass of a recti linear shape, projecting out into the lake about six hundred feet, and presenting a front of three hundred or four hundred feet, and rising to a height of about two hundred feet. An entrance has been excavated from one side to the other, opening out into large vaulted passages which com municate with the great dome, some three hundred feet from the front of the cliff. The Grand Portal, which opens out on the lake, is of magnifi cent dimensions, being about one hundred feet in height, and one hundred and sixty-eight feet broad at the water level. The distance from the verge of the cliff, over the arch, to the water, is one hundred and thirty-three feet, leaving thirty-three feet for the thickness of the rock above the arch itself. The extreme height of the cliff is about fifty feet more, making, in all, one hundred and eighty-three feet. In addition to these main passages, there are numerous other openings, smaller and intricately formed, some of which are seen in the foregoing sketch, at the water's edge. It is impossible, by any arrangement of words, or by any combination of colors, to convey an adequate idea of this wonderful scene. The vast dimensions of the cavern, the vaulted passages, the varied effects of the light as it streams through the great arch and falls on the different objects, the deep emerald-green of the water, the unvarying swell of the lake, keeping up a succession of musical echoes, the reverberations of one's own voice coming back with startling effect, \u2014 all these must be seen, and heard, and felt, to be fully appreciated. Beyond the grand portal, the cliffs gradually diminish in height, and the general trend of the coast is more to the south-east ; hence, the rock beino1 less exposed to the force of the waves, bears fewer marks of their destruc tive action. The entrance to Chapel river is at the most easterly extremity of a sandy beach, which extends for a quarter of a mile, and affords a con-"], [427, "\u00bb 1 . r,, .., I 11, 1V1 II, .,,1 . ., 11 Y \u00a3>A1I RUCK IJIS'L'ANT /IKW. t late .X"], [428, ""], [429, "SAIL nil ' !

The Chapel \u2014 la Chapelle of the voyageurs \u2014 if not the grandest, is among the most grotesque of nature's architecture here displayed. The three views (Plates XIII., XIV., XV.,) convey a faithful idea of its appearance as seen from the east and the west, as well as its interior. Unlike the excavations before described, which occur at the water's edge, this has been made in the rock at a height of thirty or forty feet aboVe the lake. The interior consists of a vaulted apartment, which has not inaptly received the name it bears. An arched roof of sandstone, from ten to twenty feet in thickness, rests on four gigantic columns of rock, so as to leave a vaulted apartment of irregular shape, about forty feet in diameter, and about the same in height. The columns consist of finely stratified rock, and have been worn into curious shapes. At the base of one of them, an arched cavity, or niche, has been cut, to which access is had by a flight of steps, formed by the projecting strata. The disposition of the whole is such as to resemble, very much, the pulpit of a church ; since there is, overhead, an arched canopy, and in front, an opening out towards the vaulted interior of the chapel, with a flat tabular mass in front, rising to a convenient height for a desk, while on the right is an isolated block, which not inaptly represents an altar ; so that, if the whole had been adapted expressly for a place of worship,, and fashioned by the hand of man, it could hardly have been arranged more appropriately. It is hardly possible to describe the singular and unique effect of this extraordinary structure ; it is truly a temple of nature \u2014 \" an house not made with hands.\" On the west side, and in close proximity, Chapel river enters the lake, precipitating itself over a rocky ledge ten or fifteen feet in height.* It is surprising to see how little the action of the stream has worn away the rocks which form its bed. There appears to have been hardly any recession of the cascade, and the rocky bed has been excavated only a foot or two, since the stream assumed its present direction. It seems, therefore, impossible that the river could have had any influ ence in excavating the Chapel itself, but its excavation must be referred to a period when the waters of the lake stood at a higher level. Near the Grand Portal, the cliffs are covered, in places, with an efflo resence of sulphate of lime, in delicate crystallizations ; this substance not only encrusts the walls, but is found deposited on the moss which lines them, forming singular and interesting specimens, which, however, cannot be transported without losing their beauty. At the same plaee, we found numerous traces of organic life, in the form of obscure fucoidal markings which seem to be the impressions of plants, similar to those described by Hall, as occurring in the Potsdam sandstone of New York. These were first noticed at this place by Dr. Locke, in 1847. * At this fall, according to immemorial usage among the voyageurs in ascending the lake, the mangeurs de lard, who make their first trip, receive baptism ; which consists in giving them a severe ducking \u2014 a ceremony somewhat similar to that practised on green-horns, when \" crossing the line.\" Ex.\u2014 5"], [440, "130 [4] The phenomena of cross stratification are beautifully shown in the columns of the Chapel, and at numerous points along the whole lme of the Pictured Rocks.

The Grand Sable, represented in Plate XVI., possesses a scenic interest little inferior to that of the Pictured Rocks. The explorer passes abruptly from a coast of consolidated sand to one of loose materials ; and although in the one case the cliffs are less precipitous, yet in the other, they attain a higher altitude. He sees before him a long reach of coast, resembling a vast sand-bank, more than three hundred and fifty feet in height, without a trace of vegetation. Ascending to the top, rounded hillocks of blown sand are observed with occasional clumps of trees, standing out like oases in the desert. This has been described, by former travellers, as a gigantic dune, but we have shown* that it is composed of stratified materials accu mulated during the drift epoch, and that the dune-like appearance is due to the trickling down of the loose and highly comminuted sands. At the base of these cliffs, the sandstone is occasionally seen by the water margin in low ledges ; but after leaving them, it does not reappear until we reach the mouth of Tequamenen river, seventy miles eastward. Ascending into township 48, range 8, the river, according to Dr. Houghton, is precipitated over two ledges of this rock, the one forty and the other forty-five feet in height. Along the southern coast of this bay, it is occa sionally seen in reefs, and at the base of the islets. From one of these, Mr. Forrest Shepherd, several years ago, procured two or three specimens of Lingula. 7- At Saut Ste. Marie, the river falls twenty-one feet, in the distance of a mile, over this rock, which is exposed at the head of the rapids, on the islands and in its bed. It is very fissile, of a brick-red color, and inter spersed with the spherical blotches before described. It here dips, as observed in other parts of the region, at a gentle angle away from the azoic series which occur on the opposite, or Canadian side of the river.' i* The junction of the Potsdam and calciferous sandstone is supposed to occur near the southern portion of Sugar island ; but the accumulations of drift have buried up the subjacent rocks. Mr. Murray of the Canada survey has traced it along the northern shore of Lake Huron, where it is seen, as in our district, in a nearly horizontal position, filling up the hollows in the quartz rock ; but, in many places, he remarks, the irregularities in this ancient bottom- are so great, that different members of the fossiliferous groups come in contact with it. Captain Bay field describes it as occupying low levels and forming nearly horizontal strata at the bottom of Lake George, whilst the horizontal fossiliferous limestone of St. Joseph's and Sugar island rise into higher ridges.f The ancient land, as we before remarked, from which these arenaceous beds were derived, lay to the north-west ; since there, they acquire their greatest expansion, and thin out, as traced to the south-east. It is proba ble that along the St. Mary's river, the vertical range both of the Potsdam and calciferous sandstone is less than a hundred feet. Mr. Murray estimates the thickness of the former at forty feet ; but does not appear to have re cognized the latter, in any place. The south-westerly prolongation of this sandstone, which, starting from Chocolate river, sweeps around the granite, and flanks the southern slope \u2022 Part I. p. 210. t Lond. Qr. Journ. Geol. Soc, April, 1845,"], [444, "[4] 132 he axis, is obscurely tracea, in consequence of the depth of the superfi cial materials. Mr. Burt describes it as a coarse, quartzose rock, generally red, but in some places mottled, and in others of a yellowish white. Mr. Hall failed to detect it in the bed of the Escanaba river, which, after leaving the granite, winds its way for some distance through drifted materials. On section 33, township 40, range 30, Messrs. Whittlesey and Desor dis covered this sandstone, with the calciferous superimposed, in a nearly hori zontal position ; and, further to the south-east, it reappears in isolated patches. The mineral characters of this deposit and its relation 'to the older rocks, are fully described by Mr. Whittlesey, in the section included in the chapter on the azoic system. \u25a0 Where it crosses the Menomonee, the belt is about \u25a0 fourteen miles in width ; the strata dip very gently, corres ponding with the slope of the country, since the subjacent slates and igneous rocks are exposed in the bed of the river for ten miles, after the sandstone is intersected. In descending the river, it is first observed near the foot of Chippewa island. The subjacent rocks in this vicinity consist of talcose slates, in nearly vertical beds, intermingled with dark, compact, igneous rocks and crystalline greenstone. Their contour is very irregular, as though they had been abraded before the deposition of the arenaceous beds which occupy the inequalities in the surface of the more ancient rocks, in horizontal lay ers. The greatest inclination observed in the superior rock wras 3\u00b0 to the south-east. The sandstone consists of alternating bands of red and wThite, and is so friable, when first removed, that it may be crushed in the hand. The grains are coarse and silicious, adhering together without any visible cement. After having parted with the water disseminated through the pores, it acquires a considerable degree of consistency, and is little acted on by the weather. The following section (Fig. 19) occurs on the left bank of the river, near the foot of Chippewa island. (Fig. 19.) Section on the Menomonee river. 1. Drift, composed of coarse rubble and sand, enveloping angular fragments of Trenton limestone. 2. Alternating layers of white and red sandstone. 3. Talcose slates, of the azoic series. 4. Compact serpentine rocks. At the White Rapids, the sandstone is again exposed, presenting very nearly the same external characters, except that it is less discolored, and reposing on the uptilted edges of the quartz. It may be seen in some of the rapids below, and reappears, for the last time, in the river banks,"], [445, "133 [4] forming ledges six or eight feet high, about three miles above the Big Bend in township 35, range 29. \" * In this vicinity, Mr. Desor discovered, in some of the loose masses of this rock, other fossils than the Lingula, which are so characteristic of this group further to the east. These fossils consist of the fragments of one or more species of trilobites, resembling Asaphus. From the characters preserved in a single caudal extremity, one species is identical with that which occurs in the same rock on the Mississippi and St. Croix rivers. From the Menomonee river, the Potsdam sandstone approaches within fifteen or twenty miles of the shore of Green bay, being distinctly exposed on all the streams flowing into it. Continuing in the same direction, its easterly limit passes near the Great Bend in the Wolf river, northwest from the outlet of Lake Winnebago. From thence, meandering westerly, it fol lows nearly the course of Woff river, crossing it in the neighborhood of Lake Pauwaiceen, and is thence prolonged southwesterly towards Green and Puckaway lakes. In the neighborhooel of Pleasant Valley, about twelve miles west of Strong's Landing, on the Fox river, it is exposed in several low escarpments, succeeded by the calciferous sandstone, which here pre sents its usual characters. From this region, its southern limit stretches to the west and north-west. The country here presents a feature which con tinues to the Mississippi river. The hills appear to be outliers, capped by the calciferous sandstone, or succeeding limestones, while the valleys and the lower part of the escarpments are composed of the Potsdam. The rock is fine-grained, of a light-yellow color and very friable. Some of the superior beds, which are thin, have been wrought for grindstones. The friable character of this sandstone is one of its most prominent fea tures, and, owing to this circumstance, the escarpments are not usually high, or abrupt, unless it has been protected by the overlying rock. In its want of cohesion, it differs, in a very marked degree, from the prevailing cha racter of this rock, as developed in New York and Canada, where it is usually, though not always, compact. It is not, however, unlike the sand stone of the Pictured Rocks, and is less friable than that of the Mississippi and St. Croix region. The almost uninterrupted continuity with which this rock can be traced, even from its eastern extension through Canada and along the northern shore of Lake Huron to the St. Mary's river, and thence westerly, leaves no doubt as to its true position and identity in age with the Potsdam sand stone of New York. If we were at a loss in thus tracing it continuously, we have still the evidence of the succeeding fossiliferous strata, which show, conclusively, the same relations to this sandstone as they do to its equiva lent in New York. With both these evidences combined, we cannot hesi tate for a moment in our conclusion regarding its age and place in the series. From the points just noticed, where this sandstone appears in eastern Wisconsin, it can be traced uninterruptedly across the entire breadth of the state to the Mississippi and St. Croix rivers. It is true, at the last named localities, we have the evidence of fossils which are not known to occur in its easterly extension ; but we have already noticed the occurrence of the Trilobite on the Menomonee, while we have the Lingula everywhere, though in far greater profusion in the St. Croix region than elsewhere. In draw- \u2022 The description of the westerly prolongation of this sandstone is from the MS. of Mr. H\u00abU."], [446, "[4] 134 ing inferences as to the age of the rock, from the occurrence of these fossils, it should be remembered that it is by no means improbable that similar ones may yet be found in more easterly localities. They seem to be coexistent with calcareous bands, or the more calcareous portions of the group, and it is to this modification that we should look for the develop ment of the fauna of this ancient period. From all this evidence, we regard the question of the age of this rock as settled \u2014 that the Potsdam sandstone of New York is identical with that of the Mississippi and the St. Croix. One great source of doubt and per plexity in its determination, heretofore, was the recurrence of a sandstone identical in character with the lower, but superior in position to the calcife rous sandstone, or lower magnesian limestone. It is a thin mass, evidently due to a recurrence of the same causes which produced the inferior deposit. This has been well elucidated by Dr. Owen in his reports on the upper Mis sissippi, in which he has shown that, near the junction of the lower sand stone with the calciferous, there are several alternations of calcareous and silicious bands, the latter having the character of the sandstones below, and the former of the calcareous deposits above. These occur in several places on the upper Mississippi river, and give the geologist an introduction to that condition of things which subsequently produced the upper sandstone, which is distributed over a large part of Wisconsin, so often mistaken for the lower member of the series ; but which, in fact, is separated from it by two or three hundred feet of calcareous rocks. This upper sandstone can be regarded in no other light than as the result of the same causes which produced the Potsdam, and were suspended during the period of the deposition of the calciferous sandstone, or lower magne sian limestone, to be renewed, for a short period, in the deposition of a mass of sandstone, varying from fifty to eighty feet in thickness, upon the sur face of the calcareous deposit. This fact shows the more intimate connec tion between these two lower groups than has heretofore been suspected. It is, nevertheless, shown in many places within the Lake Superior district, that the true sandstone, as it is traced upward, becomes gradually calca reous, and \" finally passes into well-characterized, compact, magnesian limestone.\"* The same is true, also, of this rock, in Canada and New York ; while, however, there is rarely any evidence of increase in the sili cious materials towards the termination, as we observe in the west. In some localities, there are thin but distinct bands, near the upper portion, having an oolitic structure, which, as we go westward, appear to be re placed by beds of a granular texture and of a silicious character. CA.LCIFEB.OUS SANDSTONE. In the eastern part of this district, this rock is but imperfectly defined. The north shore of Drummond's island does not extend sufficiently far to reach it, and it is but obscurely seen on the shores of the St. Mary's river. In tracing the strata westward, this rock is distinctly defined in the banks of the Escan&ba river, and can be traced from above the forks for several miles below. It preserves its characters in a remarkable degree, although it does not expand to a greater thickness than fifty feet. The upper por- * Part I., p. 117."], [447, "[4] 135 tions are highly calcareous, having, on fresh fracture, the peculiar granular structure so characteristic of this rock. It is thin-bedded, and contains small cavities lined with crystals of calc-spar, or quartz, and sometimes simply with hornstone. The surfaces of the layers are often impressed with the forms of marine plants, identical in character with those associated with the calciferous of New York. The lower part of this rock, as seen on the Escanaba, is thin-bedded, the layers not more than from three to six inches thick, often variegated and highly silicious. This, though not one of the characteristic features in its eastern extension, was again observed in Wisconsin, along the valley of the Fox river. The lowest layers were of an olive, or dark-slate color, having the same character in texture and color as the beds on the St. Croix river, above Stillwater. These beds may, perhaps, with equal propriety, be re- ferred to the lower sandstone, and regarded as exhibiting a transition from one rock to another. On the Escanaba, the only fossil observed was a species of Lingula. This rock, according to the observations of Messrs. Foster and Whitney, is distinctly exhibited on the Menomonee. \" In descending the river, it is first seen at the head of the Grand Rapids, and continues thence to the first saw-mill, sixteen miles from its mouth, occupying a belt nearly eight miles in width. The lower layers are of a buff color, sub-crystalline in their texture, and contain numerous geodes, lined with crystals of rhomb and dog-tooth spar, quartz, &c. On chemical analysis, it is found to contain a large percentage of magnesia. Interstratified with it, are to be seen thin bands of sandstone, tinged red by the peroxide of iron, which contain suffi- cient carbonate of lime to cause a brisk effervescence with acids. The rapids, more than a mile in extent, are over this rock ; but the adjoining banks are so low, that it is difficult to obtain good exposures. The upper layers, however, as displayed at the saw-mill, are frequently made up of rounded grains of quartz, united by a calcareous cement, which communicate to the mass the appearance of an oolitic structure, though none, in fact, exists.\" Tracing this rock westerly from the St. Mary's river, there appears to be a gradual augmentation in thickness. This is apparent, when we compare its development on the Escanaba, and on the Wisconsin and Mississippi rivers. In its easterly extension, its increase is equally great, attaining, on the St. Lawrence, a thickness equal to that exposed on the Mississippi. Little can be said, in detail, of this rock, since nearly the entire extent of country occupied by it, in this district, is covered by forests ; and it is only in the river banks that good exposures exist. From all that can be observed, it maintains the same character here as in other localities, both to the east and west ; and, from what we know of it elsewhere, and from its tenuity and unaltered condition in this district, we cannot expect the occur- rence of any minerals of economic value. Except that this rock is so im portant a member of the series, both in its eastern and western extension, it might be regarded as a subordinate member of the lower Silurian limestones.\" THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS. We have thus endeavored to define the boundaries and describe the prin-"], [448, "[4] 136 cipal peculiarities of the Potsdam and calciferbus sandstones which play so conspicuous a part in the geology of the north-west. _ From the details, incorporated into this chapter, it will be seen- that, wherever the Potsdam sandstone comes in contact with the granite, or prior-formed schists, it is observed to have a slight inclination away from the older rocks, rarely exceeding 8\u00b0 or 10\u00b0. It is not necessary to suppose that this inclination has been occasioned by a subsequent bodily upheaval of the granite, but that it was, in the first instance, deposited at this angle. From the topography of this region, it is evident that the sandstone was deposited in a basin-shaped depression, having an irregular bottom. Granite for the most part constitutes the rim of Lake Superior, and we have seen that it rose above the surface of the ocean in which the Silurian strata were accumulated. Where the materials forming strata are for a while mechanically sus pended, or held in chemical solution, they will, when thrown down, accom modate themselves in a measure to the preexisting inequalities : \u2014 so, too, where they have been distributed along a shelving shore, they partake in some degree, of the prevailing slope. Hence, a hasty observer might infer that there had been a slight uptilting of the land, when in fact it had re mained undisturbed. It will be seen, from the investigations of Dana, that the detrital accumulations around the islands of the Pacific have almost invariably an inclination sea-ward, where there is no evidence of upheaval ; and Mr. Jukes, another explorer in the same field, mentions a similar mode of occurrence at Heron island, where not only the sand and intermingled fragments of coral exhibit this tendency, but the solid coral, also, is tra versed by lines of cleavage conformable to those of the stratified deposits, the whole clipping sea-ward at an angle of from 8\u00b0 to 10\u00b0. From the experiments of M. de Wegmann, it would appear that sedi mentary strata may be deposited on slopes not exceeding 40\u00b0, and that it is not safe to assume an upheaval, simply from the unconformability of the strata, where there is no evidence of dislocation, or protrusion. Thus, sandstones, or other sedimentary strata, folded over a granite nucleus, at moderate angles, do not necessarily indicate that the nucleus is posterior to the sandstones, since the latter might have been deposited over and around it. The bed of the Gulf of Mexico, near Galveston, has such a constant and regular slope that sailors can calculate the distance from shore by the depth of water. By sounding at two points, the distance between which is known, the difference in depth will represent the tangent of the angle with the coast ; and this angle being known, the distance is easily ascertained by means of a second rectangle triangle.* The want of horizontality in the stratification, therefore, is not of itself, proof of upheaval. * Bulletin of the Geol. Soc. of France, April, 1850."], [449, "137 [4] REMARKS. Great diversity of opinion has been entertained with regard to the age of this sandstone. Dr. Jackson, in his report communicated to the Land Office, in 1849, describes it as the new-red, and seems to think that he has clearly demonstrated that it cannot belong to the Potsdam. He founds his belief on the fact, that a patch of Silurian limestone has been discovered, with a high inclination, in the midst of the sandstone, and hence infers that the latter is the superior rock. He also states that a fragment of Penta merus oblongus was obtained from this locality, which would identify it with the Niagara limestone ; and that, therefore, this sandstone must belong, either to the old-red, or the new-red. From the absence of fossils, and from mineralogical resemblance and mineral contents, he thinks it must be referred to the latter. This reasoning would be conclusive, if the facts were admitted. We have shown, in our former report, that the region where the limestone is exposed, exhibits many evidences of local disturbance ; that in some places the sandstone rises in hills, having a quaquaversal dip, and that a few miles farther west, the igneous rocks break through, and form a mountain a thousand feet in height. The highly inclined position of these beds, therefore, proves nothing. Admitting that the limestone is the inferior rock, is it not singular that it should nowhere be found interposed between the slates and the sandstone, along a line two hundred and fifty miles in length ? Mr. Whitney's notes, which furnished him with all the informa tion he possessed \u2014 he never having seen the locality \u2014 will not authorize the inferences which have been drawn from them. On page 625, (Docu ments accompanying President's message, 1850, Vol. III.,) he speaks of the sandstone in his district as resting directly on the granite rocks, and describes this limestone as belonging to the lower portion of the Silurian system. On p. 711, he remarks that, \" if no other data can be collected I than those which I have already, I should hardly feel willing to pronounce which is the oldest formation.\" All of the fossils were collected by Mr. Whitney. They were subse quently submitted to Mr. Hall, whose authority in these matters cannot be questioned ; and from his report, contained in Part I., it will be seen that he failed to recognize among them, the Pentamerus oblongus, or any other form, characteristic of the Niagara limestone ; but, on the other hand, he pronounces them all as bels-uging to the lower Silurian types, We have, however, in other parts of the district, as shown by the detailed examina tions, the jaost conclusive evidence as to the age of this sandstone j not"], [450, "[4] 138 only the evidence of superposition, but of fossil contents. The occurrence of the Lingula and the Trilobite in this group, must be regarded as conclu sively settling its age, and outweighing mere theoretical considerations founded on lithological characters, which are a very uncertain guide. It is but justice to those who have examined this group, that we should refer to their conclusions. Dr. Owen, in his report on the Chippewa district for 1848, pp. 57 and 58, remarks that, in the absence of all conclusive evidence derived from organic remains, there is certainly strong, presumptive evidence, that the red sandstone, and marls were deposited subsequently to the carboniferous era. Dr. Locke, in his report for 1847, describes this sandstone as the old-red, but it is evident, we think, that by this remark he did not regard it as part of the Devonian series, since he was of the opinion that it must pass beneath the Silurian limestones. On the plats of surveys of township lines, made by Mr. William A. Burt in 1845, under the direction of Dr. Houghton, the sandstone of the southern slope is designated as the Potsdam, thus leaving no doubt that Dr. Houghton had, at that time, satisfied himself as to its true position in that portion of the district. Captain Bayfield was the first to explore this sandstone with Care, while Conducting the trigonometrical survey of Lake Superior. In the Quarterly Journal of the London Geological Society, for November, 1845, there is a communication by him, \" On the junction of the Transition and Primary Rocks of Canada and Labrador.\" In reference to the sandstone of Lake Superior, he remarks : \u2014 \" No organic remains having as yet been found in this sandstone, and its junction with the Lake Huron limestone in the St. Mary's, below the rapids, being hidden by drift, water, and an impervious forest, so as hitherto to have escaped notice, it is difficult to determine, with any confidence, its place or age. There seems no reason to think that it can be more recent than the old-red sandstone ; and when it is considered that it appears in the St. Mary's at low levels, forming nearly horizontal strata at the bottom of Lake George, whilst the horizontal fossiliferous limestone of Sugar island and St. Joseph's rises into higher ridges, so as to make it appear highly probable that the sandstone occupies the inferior position, and that, moreover, a sandstone is known very generally to underlie tran sition limestone in Canada and the United States ; when all this is taken into account, it is not perhaps unlikely that the sandstone in question may belong to the Silurian rather than the Devonian period. On the other hand, its appearance in unworn slabs, that must be near the parent rock, in the neighborhood of Michilimackinac, where great beds of gypsum occur,"], [451, "[4] 139 would seem unfavorable to this conclusion ; as may also, perhaps, tne red marly beds of the Twelve Apostles.\" Mr. Foster, in his synopsis of observations between Lake Superior and Green Bay, dated September, 1848, and published in the report of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, for 1848-9, describes the sand stone of the northern and southern slope as belonging to the same age, and as resting at the base of the pal\u00e6ozoic series. That same year, Mr. Murray, of the Canada survey, examined the St. Mary's river and the northern shore of Lake Huron, anel satisfied himself that this sandstone passed beneath the Trenton limestone, and was the equivalent of the Potsdam. In reference to his explorations, Mr. Logan remarks: \u2014 \"The evidence afforded by the facts is clear, satisfactory, and indisputably conclusive.\" From the concurrent testimony of those whose opportunities for obser vation have been the most extensive, there can be but one opinion as to the age of this sandstone. It has ceased to be a mooted point."], [452, "140 [4] CHAPTER IX. LOWER SILURIAN SYSTEM \u2014 Cojrrnrcnro. HT JAMES HALL.

CHAZY, BIRDS-EYE, BLACK RIVER, AND TREWTOK LIMESTONES These limestones are so intimately connected, one with another, in the Lake Superior district, and each is so thin, that no advantage can be derived from treating them separately. It is true, however, that each can be re cognized as a distinct member of the lower Silurian series, and is characte rized by fossils peculiar to itself, as has been shown in New York. Reduced as these formations are in thickness, it will, nevertheless, be necessary to study them separately, and for the geologist, or collector, to preserve the fossils distinct. Commencing at the eastern limits of the district, these limestones are first seen upon the St. Mary's river; but they are better exposed upon the east ern side of St. Joseph's island, than upon the main land of the Michigan side. The sandstone, which is seen on Sugar island, plunges to the south, and passes beneath all these limestones, leaving, as far as observed, no trace of the calciferous ; but an interval, covered by drift, occurs, where no rock is visible. In examining the shore of the island, the first rock seen, after the disappearance of the sandstone, is the Birds-eye limestone ; but, further to the eastward, near a projecting point, some layers of the Chazy make their appearance, having, towards the bottom, an arenaceous character; while higher up, they assume an argillo-calcareous composition, and contain fossils characteristic of this member of the New York series. This lime stone is also seen to pass directly beneath other beds, which, by their pecu liar character, may be recognized as the Birds-eye. The fossils of the Chazy do not pass above the limits of the Birds-eye ; but the respective limits of the two members are as well defined here as in any of their eastern localities."], [453, "[4] 141 The Birds-eye limestone is, for the most part, thin-bedded, the layers being separated by shaly matter, which rapidly wear away under the influ ence of the atmosphere and the water, while the harder parts are brittle and easily fractured. This limestone appears to be more fossiliferous here than in New York, and, in the upper layers particularly, we found a great number of Orthoceratites. The Black-river limestone, or beds which may be regarded as the equi valent, seems to be intimately incorporated with the Birds-eye ; so much so, that no line of demarcation could be detected. Further to the south, the Trenton limestone was observed extending in a low cliff, for some distance along the river, maintaining, to a great ex tent, the characters by which it is distinguished in more eastern localities. Its higher portions are made up, in a great degree, of crinoidal remains, and it preserves the same character as this portion of the series in the Mo hawk and Black-river valleys. The whole mass is evidently much thinner than at any locality east of Lake Huron, and there is, also, a larger pro portion of shaly matter, not only between the layers, but incorporated in them. In addition to the evidence derived from lithological characters, the fossil contents are of such a character, and so abundant, as to leave no doubt in this respect. The aspect not only of this member, but of the others, was such as to impress one with the belief that, though identical in age and in composition, and a continuation of their eastern equivalents, they were de posited under circumstances less favorable to organic life, resulting from the nature of the materials deposited, or from varying conditions in the ocean. The quantity of shaly materials mingled with this limestone, and distributed in layers between the beds, would seem to indicate that a shal low and turbid state of the water prevailed during its deposition. The observations made by Messrs. Whittlesey and Desor, on the Manis tee river, tend to confirm these views. On the Escanaba river, for more than seventy miles along its meanders, above its mouth, these limestones are almost constantly exposed, and pre sent these features. The river, for the distance of a mile before it enters the lake, flows over limestone strata, which are nearly horizontal, or dip very slightly in the direction of the current, but more gently than the de scent of the water ; consequently, the strata are cut through and their edges exposed, to the thickness of only a few feet. The first rock met with, in ascending the stream, is a tough limestone, in thin layers, separated by bands of shale. It has the lithological characters of the Birds-eye, and contains Orthoceratites and other fossils, characteristic of that member of the series, as well as of the Black-river limestone. The succeeding layers, which are well-exposed about a mile above this point, consist of thin, irre gular, or wedge-shaped, layers of light ash-colored limestone, verging to a dark-blue color, and contain many species of fossils, characteristic of the Trenton series ; leaving no doubt of their identity. Many of the thin lay ers are composed of crinoidal remains, and the weathered surfaces are often completely studded with the detached joints or fragments of columns, stand ing in relief. This character of the weathered surfaces is unlike that exhi bited in any part of this limestone noticed within the limits of New York ; but an examination, of these crinoidal fragments shows that they belong to genera, and, perhaps, species known in this series elsewhere. The thin and even-bedded layers at the mouth of the river, may be qua:*-"], [454, "142 [4] ried to a considerable extent, whenever there shall exist a demand for them, and will form a durable building material. The succeeding layers are too irregular to be of any value, except for burning into lime. At the lower mill-dam, a mile above the first exposure, the banks of the stream, as well as the base of a small island, consist of beds of limestone, which form an escarpment fifteen feet thick. These also belong to the Trenton group, as indicated by the following fossils, which were collected at this point : Isotelus gigas, Calymene Blumenbachii, var. senaria, Or this testudinaria, Lept\u0153na sericed, and L. alternata. In ascending the river, this limestone, and even the identical beds, con tinue as far as the Lower falls, distant two miles from the upper mill-dam. The stream for the most part is very rapid, and the dip of the strata very nearly corresponds with the descent. At the Lower falls, the thin and irregularly stratified portions are suc ceeded by regularly-bedded strata of limestone, attaining a thickness of fifteen or twenty feet. It is impure from an admixture of arenaceous and argillaceous matter, while layers of these materials occur beneath. A few fossils were found at this place, among which were Brachiopods of the Trenton and Hudson-river groups, with Ch\u00e6tetes lycoperdon. After passing the falls, these last described beds very soon disappear, and there occurs an interval of several miles, where few traces of rock are ob served ; but, at several points, the limestone is seen by the margin of the river, \u2014 the descent of which is here very gentle \u2014 in no instance exposed to a greater thickness than two feet. The layers are thin, of a light-grey color, of a granular structure, and contain numerous cavities, some of which are partially lined with crystals. Although these few beds of themselves are of little importance ; yet, when studied in connection with the range of the series, they present a feature of considerable interest, noticed here for the first time. These compact, grey beds lie above the limestone seen at the Lower falls, since they clearly pass beneath the channel of the river, before the others emerge. Between the Lower falls and the Meadow,* distant nine miles from the lake, the surface is mainly covered by an accumulation of boulders, apparently derived from the drift, which forms a steep escarpment on the eastern side of the river. Below this place, the river curves to the eastward, cutting deeply into an accumu lation of this character ; but, above, it again bends to the westward, and lays bare, on the east side, a ledge, some twelve feet thick, of grey limestone, thin-bedded, and containing small cavities, sometimes lined with crystals of magnesian carbonate of lime, and at others empty. These * This is a somewhat remarkable feature in a river of this character, where the general de scent is very rapid, being some seven or eight hundred feet in the distance of thirty miles- The principal meadow is found at a bend in the river, the ordinary channel just above it turning abruptly to the east, and making a broad curve, where it has cut through the drift ; while to the west is another channel, through which a part of the water is discharged during freshets, uniting with the main channel half a mile below ; thus leaving on the \"west side a large tract of bottom-land, the upper extremity of which consists of a wooded island. In looking from the eastern bank, a broad meadow bounds this temporary channel, flanked on the right by the wooded island, and on the lest by the unbroken sorest. In this meadow are several elms of magnificent size, the nearest ones standing out in bold relief, while the far thest blend with the forest growth of maples, beaches, &c. Their mode of growth shows that, from their commencement, which is very ancient \u2014 since two or three were observed which had fallen from age \u2014 they had stood in the open areas which they now occupy In such wooded bottom-lands, in this latitude, we often find plants and trees flourishing luxu \"\u25a0antly^ which, under ordinary circumstances, are only (bund in more southern situations"], [455, "[4] 143 layers are a continuation of those before described as occurring at the water's edge, several miles below. From this point, onward, for a considerable distance, the dip of the strata is more rapid than the descent of the stream, though the latter is quite rapid ; consequently, there is a succession of the lower strata presented to view in its banks. I had, therefore, an opportunity of verifying my first observations, that the grey, granular, limestone rested upon some shaly and arenaceous beds with thicker calcareous strata, like those seen at the Lower falls, succeeded by the irregularly stratified beds observed at the upper mill-dam. We had an opportunity of tracing these two last divi sions for several miles along the river, where these escarpments were exposed from twenty-five to thirty feet in thickness, disclosing, in the ascending order, the Birds-eye limestone, succeeded by the Trenton, with scarcely a trace of the Black river limestone ; for, while the Ormo ceras, characteristic of the latter rock, occurs at the junction of the other two, in the same connection is found the Orthoceras multicameratum. Notwithstanding, therefore, the extreme tenuity of these different members, and the great admixture of arenaceous and shaly matter, there is no diffi culty in recognizing, at this remote point, the important subdivisions which have been made in New York, and of determining them by their charac teristic fossils. From the first exposure of the rocks above the meadow, they are almost constantly in view to the Upper falls, and from thence, onward to the forks of the river. About two miles from the upper end of the meadow, the Birds-eye limestone is seen at the level of the river and continues, with some slight undulations, to occupy the surface, as far as the first rapids below the Upper falls. At Indian creek, a short distance below the foot of the rapids, the Birds-eye limestone is very distinctly defined, and rests upon some heavy beds, which clearly represent the Chazy limestone. One of these beds is remarkable for weathering in a peculiar manner, and an examination shows that it is filled with a kind of tough, silicious and irre- gularly-shaped concretions, or segregations, which stand out in relief, while the calcareous part wastes away. At the Upper falls, the strata rise more rapidly to the northward, and though the ascent of the stream is considerable, yet, on arriving at the foot, the calciferous sandstone is exposed, forming the base of the escarpment over which the water is precipitated; while, above it, there are two layers which represent the Chazy and Birds-eye limestones and the lower part of the Trenton group. _ Here, the following section is exposed in an ascending order. 1. Birds-eye limestone, fine-grained and compact, of a bluish-drab color. 2. Calcareous layers, of a grey color, with crinoidal joints and other fossils, \u20144 feet. 3. A heavy-bedded, variegated limestone, with much silicious matter, the surface weathet ing very unevenly, \u2014 2 feet. 4. A thick, silico-calcareous bed, with fossils in the upper part, \u2014 2 feet. 6. Silico-calcareous layers at the foot of the falls, thin and even-bedded, \u2014 1 foot. The whole exposure at the falls is about fifteen feet, and in the bank above, about ten feet more. The beds forming the top of the falls disap pear below the river, near the point where Indian creek comes in from the east. The layers having the character of the Birds-eye limestone disap pear a short distance below, and are succeeded by thin beds containing"], [456, "f4] 144 abundance of Orthis lestudinaria, Leptcena sericea, and L. alternata, with other fossils of the Trenton limestone, and have the same character as some of the layers about midway in this group, as developed in the Mohawk and Black-river valleys, in New York. Above the falls, the low cliff of fos siliferous limestone continues for some distance, gradually declining to two or three feet in height above the river. The same changes take place, with the recurrence of the same layers, in ascending the stream, the strata rising more rapidly than the ascent of its bed. From this cause, we find the calciferous sandstone comin\u00b0- out from beneath the fossiliferous limestones, at a point some three miles above the falls, and continuing thence up the stream for the distance of two miles above its forks. These limestones, which have a combined thickness of less than seventy five feet, are exposed almost continuously in the bed and banks of the stream, for the distance of more than thirty miles, following its meanders, and a distance of about twenty miles in a direct line. The difference between the dip of the rock and the descent of the river, is less than sixty feet. There is, however, very little parallelism between the two ; for, within the first eight miles after leaving the lake, we meet with the highest beds of limestone in the series which occur on this river. Although its descent is rapid, yet it is unequal in its rate, and these inequalities appear to be due to undulations in the strata, which can be detected at several points. For the most part, the stream is very shallow, and its bed rocky.* Along the whole extent of this exposure of the rocks, whether examined continuously, or at intervals, there is no difficulty in identifying different portions with their New York equivalents. When taken as a whole, and all of the beds examined in connection, the principal subdivisions, such as the Chazy, Birds-eye, and Trenton limestones, are readily identified, not only by their lithological characters, but by their organic remains. Even in the arenaceous layers, which form some twTenty feet of the whole thick ness, we not only detect numerous species of fossils peculiar to the Trenton limestone, but many peculiarities of bedding, and other characteristics, which, though not easily described, are readily understood and compre hended by the geologist. It is deemed unnecessary to give farther details of the variable features of these limestones along the Escanaba river ; in all the localities examined, they offer little of economical value, aside from their application to building purposes. At the mouth of Rapid river and along its borders, and also at the mouth of the White-fish and at the head of Little Bay des Noquets, the Trenton limestone is exposed, exhibiting the same lithological characters as at the upper dam on the Escanaba. Farther explorations, made by Mr. Whitney, along the White-fish river, in crossing from Little Bay des Noquets to Lake Superior, proved the occur rence of the Trenton group, for the distance of fifteen miles, or more, from the head of the bay. The specimens procured are filled with fossils princi pally Lept\u00e6na sericea, and occasionally with L. alternata and Orthis testu dinaria, while, in lithological characters, they agree with those observed on \u2022 The name Escanaba signifies Smooth Rod, given for the reason that the stream often flows for considerable distances, over the smooth surfaces of the slightly-inclined rocks The inequalities caused by the offset of particular beds, give rise to numerous rapids and render the navigation so difficult that even a small skiff cannot be impelled against the stream when the water is low, except by using setting-poles armed with steel points."], [457, "145 [4] the Escanaba and Manistee. The country along the White-fish river is low, rismg little above the river margin ; consequently, there are i.o cliffs, or escaipments, where the strata are exposed to any extent, and specimens can be procured only at the water's edge. This river then, like the Manis tee, affords evidence of the existence ot certain groups, but does not admit of continuous observation as to their succession, thickness, and importance. In the present state of the northern peninsula, being almost an unbroken wilderness, and the elevation of the country occupied by the Silurian series but a few hundred feet above the lake, with no abrupt curves in the strata, by which they are brought to the surface, it is impossible to determine any thing more than tBe limits of the more important groups ; for all practical p.irposes, however, the determinations already made are sufficient; and it was only with the hope of acquiring more detailed information, that we de sired more time and better opportunities of investigation. Leaving the Escanaba, and following along the coast of the bay in a south-easterly direction, we soon find the limestones, just described, coming oat to the surface at the lake-level and scarcely rising above it, the cha racter of the beds being the same as those seen within a mile of the mouth of the river. At she mouth of Ford river, the country is low and there are no rocks visible. The banks consist of alluvial, or drift materials, for four miles, when there occurs a long rapid over the thin-bedded limestone, the same in character as that at the upper mill-dam on the Escanaba. Proceeding to wards Cedar river, we passed several reefs of rock and observed large slabs of limestone in the shallow water, which appeared identical with those at the mouth of the Escanaba, and lower than the thin-bedded portion of the Trenton group. Upon Cedar river, there are no rocks visible for two miles after leaving its mouth; but here, at the end of a mill-dam, the arenaceous and shaly bands, which occur at the Lower falls of the Escanaba and op posite \"Wood's Camp,\" are visible. These occupy a higher position in the series than those seen at Ford river. Few fossils were here observed, crinoidal joints being the most numerous. From the mouth of Cedar river to the mouth of the Menomonee, the more thickly-bedded portions of the Trenton, with layers of Birds-eye, occur along the margin of the bay. Although nearly in situ, the beds have been raised and broken by the water, and, in some places, piled up in walls, or barriers, which have a very artificial appearance. At the lower dam, on the Menomonee, a little above the water, limestone is observed, in places, on the right bank, its surface being ground down, and grooved with drift-scratches. Its character is very similar to that of the Birds-eye, and the only fossils observed were crinoidal joints. The west side of Green bay, from the mouth of the Menomonee to its head, was explored by Messrs. Whittlesey and Desor. The specimens colled ed showed a continuation of the same limestones which had been observed from Little Bay des Noquets to the Menomonee. The fossils collected were two species of Murchisonia, Pleurotomaria lentieularis, and several Brachiopoda. After examining the eastern shore of Green Bay, I took up my observa tions upon the same limestones at Depere, tracing them along the Fox river to the outlet of Lake Winnebago. Subsequently, in order to connect the geology of the Lake Superior district with that of the Chippewa district, I Continued roy examinations across the state of Wisconsin to the Mississippi"], [458, "[4] 146 river, and thence, at intervals, along that river to the falls of St. Anthony. At Mineral Point, the lower members of the series have become very argil laceous, weathering into a light drab color, and are characterized by nume rous fossils. At Plattsville, the Birds-eye layers are pretty well defined, though associated with much shaly matter and some layers of dark shale. The rock, on being freshly fractured, is very dark-colored, but weathers to an ashen hue. The Trenton limestone, which succeeds, is thin-bedded and light-colored, and all that remains is scarcely more than twenty-five feet in thickness. The same features are ohserved at Galena, and again at Du buque. At the latter place, the cemnection of this group with the suc ceeding limestone is very obvious. In all these localities, the entire thick ness of these lower limestones, whfch can clearly be identified with the Trenton and associated limestones of the east, is less than fifty feet; but it is possible that some better exposures? would give a greater thickness. I conceive that there can be no longer a doubt in reference to the age ot the limestones under consideration. Their identity with those of New York and of Canada has been established, no.* only by a comparison of the fossils, but also by tracing almost continuously their range from the Mo hawk, Champlain, and Black-river valleys, through Canada, to the eastern limits of this district, and thence westward, continuously, to the Mississippi river. . These remarks also apply to other groups, concer uing which some differ ence of opinion has heretofore pervailed. Feeling t.he necessity of adopt ing some recognized standard, we have referred these subdivisions, so well marked, to those which have already been made by til e New York geo logists. Before leaving the subject of these limestones, it will he necessary to recall to mind some observations made on the Escanaba r. above the Lower falls, and at the bend above the Meadow. The upper layers of grey limestone, at the last named point, have a thickness of some ' fifteen feet, are meagre in fossils, and do not appear to be identical with an y portion ot the series, which I have observed farther east. In going west\\ Tar^ * ~~ not an opportunity of observing the overlying deposits of th e Irenton limestone until I arrived in Wisconsin. Here, in numerous loc 'a|jt ies, as well as in Illinois and Iowa, the eleposit above that which is marke 'd hy an abundance of fossils characteristic of the Trenton, is a grey, of drab-,-eU.ored limestone, and very friable, forming a part of the \"cliff limestone\" >ot tt* Ohio and Indiana reports, and is c. ailed by Dr. Owen, in his report om the Lead region, the \"upper magnesian limestone.\" From its position, as well as its lithological characters, it appears that this limestone, which is the principal lead-bearing rock in t hese states, is a continuation of that no ticed on the Escanaba, lying abov e the fossiliferous beds of the Trenton limestone ; but that it has increased in thickness, as traced westwardly, and becomes an important member of tb \u00e6 series ; and hence, we have designated it in the classification of the rocks, as the \" Galena limestone.\" In the neighborhood of Galena, I >ubuque, Mineral Point and other placea, there are numerous localities where a direct succession in the beds may be; traced. It is very evident that this limestone diminishes in thickness east wardly from these points, and bece raies a very subordinate member of the series, losing, at the same time, its metalliferous character. From the general absence of fossils, and fron 1 its resemblance to the next succeeding limestone in lithological character :, no distinction has usually bsen made"], [459, "[4] 147 between them. In the localities cited, particularly in the neighborhood of Dubuque, the higher grounds are occupied by a limestone containing an abundance of Catenipora, Heliolites, and other corals marking it as of the age of the Niagara. From the relative position of these coral-bearing rocks to the lead-bearing strata, it has been inferred that they were but parts of the same group, and they have heretofore been described as such. This was the state of our knowledge, when I examined this series in 1841, and having satisfied myself that the coral-bearing limestone of Wis consin and Iowa could be clearly identified with the Niagara group of New York, I expressed the opinion that the lower part of the cliff limestone was of the same age. Up to the present time (1850) I am not aware of any published evidence from an examination of the rock in place, to prove that the lead-bearing rock is of lower Silurian age.* The principal fossil re sembles a Coscinopora, but is probably a Receptaculites. I have found, however, in the same rock, the head of an Illcenus, a Lept\u0153na, not unlike L. alternata, Spirifer lynx, and Atrypa increbescens. The still higher, thin-bedded, argillaceous limestone contains a species of Lingula, undis tinguishable from L. subquadrata, Spirifer lynx, P^eurotomaria lenticula ris, Murchisonia bellicincta, and another species with angular volutions, a large Orthoceras, and fragments of Illcenus. Up to this point, I found no corals of the Niagara period, and, though the fossils are not numerous, they are all of lower Silurian forms, and furnish the best evidence we have of the age of this limestone. This lead-bearing rock, as before ohserved, rests upon fossiliferous strata of the Trenton age, which can be recognized as the identical group traced over several hundred miles. The galena sometimes penetrates the Trenton series, in films or sheets, but does not form veins, as in the grey, heavy bedded limestone above. From all the evidence, therefore, the lead-bearing, or Galena limestone, must be regarded as a distinct member of the lower Silurian system, which is not recognized at the east. From its gradual diminution in thickness, its source appears to have been towards the west. The conditions of the ocean, though favorable to the deposition of this immense mass of calcareous mate rials, were unfavorable to the development of organic life ; for, although there remain a few species which continue through the period of its depo sition, the greater number known in the group below did not survive beyond the commencement of this. The occurrence of more highly fossiliferous strata above, still of lower Silurian age, would show that the Galena lime stone does not form a series of transition beds between the upper and lower Silurian. To the south and south-west, this rock is of limited extent, probably nearly coincident with the lead region; the universal testimony showing that no productive lead mines exist in the western states, out of the range of this rock. * Mr. Conrad, in the proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, 1843, expressed his opinion that the lead-bearing limestone was of the age of the Trenton, from certain fossils obtained at Mineral Point. These fossils are from the Trenton lime stone proper, but no productive veins are known to occur in that rock so far as I can learn. Dr. Owen in his report upon that region has remarked that the veins die out on reaching the \"blue limestone.\" This blue limestone, in Wisconsin, is no other than the Trenton limestone containing large numbers of the fossils peculiar to that rock, and underlying the bine marl and limestone of Cincinnati and other western localities, and which are not recog nized in central and western Wisconsin."], [460, "[4] 148 This fact sets at rest all speculations as to the probable metalliferous cha racter of certain rocks which have been supposed to be identical with the Galena limestone. The lead-bearing rock is a peculiar one, holding a cer tain place in the series, and of limited geographical extent. It is metal liferous throughout the greater part of its known limits, where it has considerable thickness. The lead veins are almost wholly confined to it, and evidently have their source in it. The small quantities sonietimes found below its base are in seams that die out, as they penetrate the inferior rock, and it often takes the form of interlaminations among the strata, having little cemnection with the lower masses. Regarding the higher beds before alluded to as identical with the Galena limestone, it is not probable that the rock contains any valuable deposits of ore within the Lake Superior district ; but, on the other hand, the small thickness of the mass would preclude the possibility of the occurrence of valuable veins. The fact of the existence of this rock, as a distinct mem ber of the series, is interesting in a geological point of view, and opens the question as to the completeness of the series, which has been studied in New York, Canada, Pennsylvania and Virginia. There is another question which may arise, and that is, as to the relations of the lead-bearing rock to the Hudson-river group ; for there appears to be little probability of identifying this group, at any of the localities west of Lake Michigan. If the upper, ash-colored beds on the Escanaba are identical with the Galena limestone, there is then no difficulty in determin ing the question ; for the Hudson-river group is superior to this limestone. Although I am not aware that the shales of this group have been recog nized in Wisconsin, or Iowa, I am disposed to believe that the numerous fossils found in the drift, \u2014 among which are a small Nucula, Cleidophorus, Pleurotomaria, and others, \u2014 are derived from the destruction of beds of that *ge, which lie above the Galena limestone. This opinion is further strength ened from having found on Little Bay des Noquets some beds filled with small fossils similar to those noticed ; and I have received a specimen of similar character, said to have been procured, in place, near Galena HUDSON-RIVER GROUP. The first appearance of this group, in this district, is upon the northern side of Drummond's island, where it lines the shore for the distance of seve ral miles, forming, in fact, that portion of the island lying north of the deep bays which indent its eastern and western extremities. The thickness ex posed is not more than thirty or forty feet of the upper part of the group, consisting of some calcareous beds, with Favistella stellata in great abun dance. Below these are alternations of shaly and calcareous layers with Streplelasma, Ch\u00e6tetes, Spirifer lynx, Atrypa increbescens, Orthis occi dentalis, Modiolopsis modiolaris, Ambonychia radiat.a, and other forms, characteristic of this period. As the strata appear here, they are far more calcareous than in New York, and approach in character the same beds in Ohio and Indiana ; while the prevailing fossils are those which predominate in the western localities. From the evidence here observed, this group of strata has undergone great changes between this point and the northern shore of Lake Ontario ; the changes being in the accession of calcareous and the diminution of, arena-"], [461, "149 [4] ceous matter. In the state of New York, the prevailing characters of the strata are shaly and arenaceous, calcareous matter being subordinate to the other two. After leaving Drummond's island, we had no good opportunity of seeing the strata of this group, before arriving at Pointe aux Baies, between Great and Little Bays des Noquets. Here, the calcareous shales, with thin bands of limestone, indicate the higher portions of the group, and are charged with fossils, principally those before noticed. The highest layer visible contains large numbers of Ambonychia radiata, with a few speci mens of Modiolopsis modiolaris. The surface of the country on the east side slopes gradually down to the level of the water, and offers no oppor tunity for determining the nature of the beds upon that side. On the western side, however, there is a low escarpment, interrupted at intervals, but nearly continuous, to a point opposite the mouth of the Escanaba river. The strata exposed along this coast consist of alternations of cal careous and argillaceous beds, above which is a considerable thickness of arenaceous and calcareous strata, readily crumbling on exposure to the weather. The highest portions seen are compact strata of impure lime stone, containing both arenaceous and argillaceous matter incorporated with the mass and intercalated in thin layers. In the lower beds, the fossils are principally Brachiopoda ; Orthis testudinaria, Lept\u0153na sericia, and L. alternata being the prevailing forms. A single thin stratum is charged with small Nucula, Cleidophorus and minute Gasteropoda. Another cal careous layer is partially filled, and the upper surface covered, with frag ments of Isotelus. This stratum can be traced continuously for more than a mile along the coast, and is everywhere charged with these fragments. A single articulation from the shaly mass, just above this layer, measured ten inches in length, which represents the transverse diameter of the animal, the length having been twice as great. Many of the layers are completely covered with fragments of branching forms of Ch\u00e6tetes lyco perdon, and considerable variety of surface is presented among them. In the succeeding beds there are some thin, calcareous layers, with Orthis testudinaria and Spirifer lynx in the softer and lower shale, while in the higher portions occur the Modiolopsis and Ambonychia, with a few Orthoceratites. The heavy, calcareous beds above have still the same fossils as those next below, which we have just enumerated. Except in lithological characters, arising from the accession of calcareous matter, and the almost entire absence of arenaceous strata, the similarity between these beds and the upper beds of the Hudson-river group, as developed in north-western New York, is complete. Although their actual contact with the Trenton limestone was not observed, there can remain no question as to their relative position. The limestones, as already described, exist upon the west side of the bay, with a uniform dip south-easterly in a direction at right angles to the curve of their outcrop. The beds of the Hudson-river group show an escarpment on the east side, dipping conformably with those on the west, and conse quently lying above them. This fact is important to be established here ; for, there can be no doubt of the positive identity, in composition and fossil contents, of the shales and calcareous beds of Pointe aux Baies and Little Bay des Noquets with the \"blue limestone and marls\" of Cincinnati, Ohio, of Madison, Indiana, and other places. For these beds, then, on the northern shore of Lake.Michigan, we estab-"], [462, "150 [4] lish a distinct geological horizon, and in tracing westward the Trenton lime stone, we prove that they are not contemporaneous with, or a continuation of, that group. If, therefore, this is the case in the north, it is a legitimate inference that those further south hold the same relation (although we are not able there to see the base of the Hudson-river group) ; anel the further inference may be drawn, that the blue limestone and marls of Cincinnati and other localities do not include the Trenton, or any of the lower lime stones, but are strictly the equivalent of the Hudson-river group, being, in fact, everywhere but a continuation of it, changing, as we go westward, its lithological characters, and including other fossils. It has been deemed necessary to go somewhat into these details, for the reason that it has been made a question whether the groups of New York were continuous and could be recognized in the west; and, particularly, whether the blue limestone and associated marls could be identified with the Hudson-river group of New York. The conditions of the Hudson-river group, in the west and south-west, are such as we might expect, when we consider the source from whence the materials have been derived, \u2014 that is, from the east and the north-east. The coarser materials were first deposited, while the finer portions were carried farther into the ocean, and thrown down as the current diminished in velocity ; consequently, we should expect just what we find, an impal pable mud, which, mingling with calcareous matter derived from organic or other sources, has produced such a deposit as we see distributed over so wide an area. It is not to be expected that a sedimentary deposit, made under such circumstances, should present a homogeneity of aspect over the whole area. Greater depth of ocean, distance from land and from the source of supply, as well as conflicting currents, would unite in producing the changes which we observe ; and this, so far from creating surprise, is what we might reasonably expect. In tracing the boundaries of the Hudson-river group on the map, it will be seen that, from Pointe aux Baies, its trend is in the direction of Green Bay, and there is no doubt that this arm of Lake Michigan has resulted from its excavation and removal, affording a striking example of the depen dence of the topographical features of a country upon its geological struc ture. It is not until arriving near the head of the bay, on the eastern shore, that we again meet with the shales and calcareous beds of this group, forming an escarpment which, with some interruptions, continues to the \"Red banks,\" where it is concealed by alluvium; but beyond this, it can be traced along the base of an escarpment, as far as Lake Winnebago. Its development along the eastern margin of this lake has been examined by Mr. Whittlesey. From this point, I have been able to learn little of its occurrence in a southerly direction, in Wisconsin and Illinois. In a south westerly direction, in passing through these states, I saw nothing of it, be yond what has already been noted in the remarks on the Trenton limestone. It is not impossible that this group may be found to exist in the north-west ; if so, it must lie above the Galena limestone, which does not enter into our estimates, in speaking of the Trenton and Hudson-river groups in eastern localities. From the observations made upon the shores of Little Bay des Noquets and of Green Bay, it is evident that this group has greatly diminished from its amplitude in New York, or in the vicinity of Cincinnati. The aggre gate of all the beds seen would not give over one hundred or one hundred"], [463, "151 [4] and fifty feet, though it is by no means certain that we have been able to see the entire thickness. In localities at a distance from the lake-shore, the junction of this group with that above and below is concealed by drift and alluvium, while no absolute point of contact could be observed along the shores of the bays and rivers. From what has been stated, we believe it will be admitted that this group does undergo the lithological changes which we have pointed out, and that to these changes are due the peculiar characters of the blue limestone and marls of Cincinnati. We shall attempt to show in the succeeding pages that with this group terminates the true fauna of the lower' Silurian period."], [464, "152 [4] CHAPTER X. UPPER SILURIAN AND DEVONIAN SERIES.

CLINTON GROUP We now commence our description of the groups which compose, in this district, the upper portion of the Silurian system, to wit: the Clinton group, the Niagara group, and the Onondaga salt group. The Medina sandstone, which occurs below the Clinton group, in New York, has not been recognized in this district sufficiently developed to require a separate notice, while higher up in the series, there occur several well-marked"], [465, "[4] 153 groups in New York, which are entirely wanting here. These will be adverted to in the succeeding pages of this report. Resting at the base of the upper Silurian, we find the Cinton and Niagara groups, which are here so intimately associated with each other, that the line of demarcation between them cannot readily be drawn. It has been shown in the reports on the geology of New York, that the strata composing the Clinton group contain a larger proportion of calcareous matter as they are traced to the westward ; while, in the same direction, the shaly and argillaceous beds gradually diminish in thickness and import ance. So great is this change, that this group, which, in the central part of the state, consists mainly of shaly and arenaceous beds with very subordinate layers of calcareous matter, is, at the Niagara river, made up of two mem bers of limestone and one of shale. Although, in some Canadian localities, the shaly and arenaceous beds acquire a temporary importance, yet the cal careous matter, on the whole, greatly predominates. The first point in the district, where the strata of the Clinton group were observed, is at the eastern extremity of Drummond's island. Here, in some thin, calcareou's beds, at the level of the water, we recognized several fossils of this group. The strata are thin-bedded, of an argillo-calcareous cha racter, and of an ashen or drab color. Only a few feet in thickness are exposed, and, alone, they would hardly have been regarded as of any impor tance. These beds, however, are below others which are well-characterized by an abundance of Niagara fossils, and overlie other strata belonging to the Hudson-river group, though the actual junction of the two has not been observed. In going westward, along the northern shores of the Lakes Hu ron and Michigan, I was unable to observe any beds so low as those on this part of Drummond's island, until after having passed the entrance to Little Bay des Noquets. About three miles above this point, and along the base of a high bluff, I found, at the water-level, layers of precisely the same character and characterized by the same fossils. The fossils consisted of a species of Cytherina, an Avicula, and Murchisonia subulata. At this local ity, they lie at the base of a cliff about two hundred and fifty feet in height. These thin beds, as traced upwards, gradually pass into thicker beds which belong to the Niagara group. We must regard these thin, calcareous strata as intermediate between the two groups, containing, however, no fossils cha racteristic of the Niagara period. In examining the eastern shore of Green Bay, we find thin-bedded cal careous strata extending from near Washington Harbor to Sturgeon Bay, identical in general character with those at the eastern extremity of Drum mond's island and Big Bay des Noquets. Some beds were observed to be more silicious and very compact ; and, in many instances, separated by thin layers of green shale. They maintain this uniform character nearly the entire distance indicated. The line of the coast is nearly coincident with the bearing of the strata, so that we have no opportunity of seeing beds through a greater vertical range than fifty feet. On both shores of Stur geon Bay, we find beds somewhat higher in the series, and more calcareous in composition, the highest of which are charged with casts of Pentamerus oblongus. On the north-eastern side of the bay, we noticed a single bed with strong, rigid, fucoidal markings which are characteristic of some por tions of the Clinton group in New York."], [466, "[4] 154 On the south-western side, and on the next point of land in the same direction, the following section in an ascending order may be seen. 5 Light-grey, or drab-colored limestone, friable, with Pentamerus oblongus, corals, &c. Some of tie layers are two, or three feet thick. One layer marked with a net-work of fucoids, the stems one-half or three-fourths of an inch in diameter. -Thickness, 10 4 fThin, calcareous, with silico-calcareous layers, the same as were noticed at Windy En- campment, on the east side of Green Bay, opposite the mouth of the Menomonee river, | graduating into the mass below, but still showing a line of separation. \u2014 Thickness from 3 Shaly beds alternating with silicious, silico-argillaceous and silico-calcareous layers of 'variable thickness. \u2014 Upper part more calcareous, the layers in many places having a concretionary structure, and containing Cytlierina; a continuation of the beds seen at the lake-level, on Drummond's island, and at the cliffs of Big Bay des Noquets. \u2014 Thick 2. A heavy-bedded, silico-argillaceous limestone of a greenish color, with nodules of horn- stone.\u2014 Thickness, 6 feet. 1. A soft, brittle, greenish colored mass, apparently calcareo-argillaceous, extending 4 or 6 feet above the water-level. A few miles farther to the south-west, the successive layers present the following section. (A mile farther on, about fifty feet of the same section can be seen at a single exposure in the cliff.) 5. Friable limestone with Pentamerus oblongus. \u2014 10 feet. 4. Hard, thin-bedded limestone, more or less silicious, with thin bands of greenish shale \u2014 10 feet. . . \u201e \u25a0 j j v 3. A mass, the upper layers of which are calcareous, containing Cythenna, succeeded by shaly layers of a greenish, or chocolate color, with intercalated, silicious layers. Ripple and fucoidal markings, and tracks and trails, possessing all the characters of those of the Clinton group in New York. The upper layers are less calcareous than the correspond- ing ones farther east. \u2014 20 to 25 feet. 1. Compact, tough, argillo-silicious rock, with interspersed nodules of silicious matter, some- times in layers more or less continuous. \u2014 6 feet. 1. Green, shaly rock, crumbling rapidly on exposure and showing a concretionary struc- ture, and occasionally with small cavities. \u2014 20 feet. In the preceding section, the lower part, as well as the six feet mass above, is entirely destitute of fossils. The succeeding beds are every where characterized by fucoidal markings, by tracks and trails of some animals, by ripple-marks and by smooth, even, beach-like surfaces, on some of which there are irregular depressions like those worn by water under the influence of wind and tidal currents. The peculiar features of this group resemble so much those of the same group in central New York, that their identity is unmistakable. The layers of the six feet mass, next below this, resemble very closely the grey band, or upper member of the Medina sandstone, while the next below has the color and texture of this sandstone ; and, although there is no other evidence than position in relation to the positively identified lower part of the Clinton group, it cannot be reasonably doubted that we have, at this remote point, the representative of this sandstone, which in New York and Canada forms an important member of the series. From the difficulty of obtaining a view of the whole series, arising either from denudation, as on the northern side of Drummond's island, or from their obscuration by drift accumulations, as at other places, we are not able to say * This band is at the level of the lake, on the N.W. side of Sturgeon Bay. At this point, a bluff of Uni3jtono rises to tho height of one hundred to one hundred and fifty feet, visible at intervals, though mainly covered with forests. This cliff was not examined in detail."], [467, "155 [4] with certainty whether these peculiar beds exist at other points in the dis trict. However, the alternating, shaly and arenaceous beds, marked by tracks and trails, so characteristic of this group in central New York, have now been found here. They do not exist in Canada for a long distance west of the Niagara river, and at what point they come in, we are at pre sent unable to say, having observed them only on the peninsula of Green Bay. These evidences, then, of shallow water, of beaches, marked by the trails of shells and other animals, which have been observed in New York, cease for a long interval, thus authorizing the inference that the in tervening portion of the ocean was deeper and the shores more remote. The strata of limestone and shale which occupy the intervening space are charged with Brachiopoda (and for the first time the genus Pentamerus), a few Acephala, Gasteropoda and corals. It is unquestionably true, there fore, that the conditions of the ocean, where one class of these deposits occur, must have been very different from those under which the others were thrown down. After leaving the locality cited in the preceding sec tion, an interval of two miles occurs, where no rocks are visible, when a greyish-green shale, with harder calcareous layers, appears on the shore of the bay. These beds contain fossils of the Hudson-river group, or lower Silurian series. The strata rise to the south-west, but so gradually that it was hardly possible to have passed over an interval of fifty feet of rocks not observed ; and this interval with the non-fossiliferous beds at the base of the last section, constitutes the beds of passage from the lower to the upper Silurian rocks. Although the lower fossiliferous beds are filled with organic remains, among which occur abundantly the Spirifer lynx, Orthis testudi naria, Orthis occidentalis, Lept\u00e6na alternata, and others ; yet, I was never able to detect one of them, either in the beds of passage or in the fossilife rous beds, recognized as belonging to the Clinton group. It will be observed that, in our examination along the coast of the lake from the St. Mary's river to the Detour, the exposures were all upon the upper or inclined surface, dipping lake- ward . The exceptions were of minor importance. From the Big Bay des Noquets, where we have exposed a complete section of the strata, our observations of the upper Silurian and the upper part of the lower Silurian are on the line of strike and upon the exposed cliffs of the northern outcrop. In the first instance, the slight un dulations gave us no opportunity of penetrating beneath the limestones of one group, which, from their uniform character, could not always be distin guished from one another. In the latter, or on the outcrop, every undulation presented us with an opportunity of examining beds not before seen, or of recognizing the same beds, with some slightly varying characters. Although no good opportunity offered for tracing these beds to the south ward beyond the present locality \u2014 which extends along the shore of Green Bay for a few miles south-west of Sturgeon Bay \u2014 yet, it would appear that a part of the shales in the escarpment from the head of Green Bay to Lake Winnebago, and along the eastern shore of that lake, are of the Clinton group. Pursuing the same course a little farther to the south-west, we have additional evidence of the occurrence of this group ; for, on the western side of a low escarpment of limestone, near the eastern line of the town of Hartford, we meet with a greyish crystalline mass, similar to that seen on the shores of Green Bay. Here occurs a band of iron ore, oolitic in its structure, and containing more or less shaly matter. This iron ore is undistinguishable from that associated with the Clinton group in New York"], [468, "[41 156 Although, at this locality, the ore-bed cannot be traced to a direct connec tion with this limestone, it evidently passes below it. At Sterling's, the ore is four or five feet thick, presenting the appearance of a regular, continuous bed, surrounded by a mass of pebbles and fragmentary rocks, accumulated during the drift epoch. It would appear that the outcropping edges of this bed had resisted the denuding action which has removed the shale above and below ; while the ore is simply broken up, without having been removed or transported. At a point some twenty feet higher, the limestone crops out ; while the top of the terrace is about thirty feet above the iron ore, the bottom of the valley is about the same distance below. In tracing this escarpment further to the north-east, the thickness visible is from twenty to twenty-five feet. At another point, the superincumbent limestone recedes to the eastward, and in a bend thus formed, an extensive ore-bed has been opened, by simply removing the surface soil. It is in a loose and incoherent condition, like some of the beds in this association, in Oneida county, New York. I was unable to detect any rock in connection with the ore, the under surface of the bed not being visible. Along the base of this escarpment, rise numerous springs which, uniting, form a per manent stream, indicating the existence of impervious strata beneath the limestone and iron ore. The surface of the country affords no deep ravines, and it is with difficulty that the line of the outcrop of the rocks can be fol lowed for any great distance, in a connected manner. These localities of iron ore, taken in connection with the succeeding limestones, leave no doubt of the occurrence of this portion of the Clinton group in Wisconsin ; but beyond this point, I have no evidence of its existence. It is probable, however, that traces of it will be found, on more careful examination, in following the out-cropping edges of the limestones in a more southerly di rection. To the west of the low axis, which brings up the lower limestones and sandstones and extends to the southern line of the state, I have no evi dence of the occurrence of any members of the Clinton group. . It is interesting, however, to have traced over so great an area, a subor dinate group of the systems which have been recognized in New York and Pennsylvania ; and, although having in some places the appearance of local deposits, it is proved to have a wide distribution. The ocean in which these deposits were made, however different they may be at distant points, was wide-spread, with occasional shoals and insular coasts, as evidenced by the marine vegetation and the tracks and trails of animals. The iron-ore beds, forming in New York so important an economical fea ture in the Clinton group, do not probably occur within the limits of the Lake Superior district, though they do in Wisconsin. We are led to this conclusion from the fact, that they disappear in the region of the Genessee river, and have not been observed to the westward of that point, except in Wisconsin. Neither along the shores of Green Bay, where they could not have escaped observation had they existed, nor at localities further east did we detect a trace of them. NIAGARA GROUP. It is scarcely possible, as before remarked, to describe the limestones of the Clinton group, observed in this district, as distinct from those of the Niagara group. The thin-bedded, ash-colored and sometimes concrition\u00bb"], [469, "157 [4] ary limestones which we have described as occurring at the eastern extre- mity of Drummond's island, on Bay des Noquets, and again on the eastern shore of Green Bay, pass imperceptibly into limestones, thicker bedded, more crystalline and often porous in their structure. Along the eastern shore of Green Bay the Pentamerus bed limits very nearly, the more com- pact and thin-brdded portions, and here this fossil forms a reliable guide ; but the P. oblongus, which in New York is never known above the Clinton group proper, does enter, as we have been able to discover, in many western localities, into the Niagara group. It may, therefore, be doubted whether, in the west, the calcareous beds of this period can be distinctly separated into groups ; but at present, I am not able to determine this question, which, for its perfect solution, would require many months of explo- ration with a careful examination of the succession of beds and their fossil contents. One fact of interest will strike the observer, who is familiar with the members of this group in New York, and that is : from the com- mencement of she calcareous deposits, through the whole period, there is no interruption of the materials, except by thin, shaly intercalations of a dark-green color, which, although indicating that this material still re- mained suspended in the waters of this ancient sea, was not sufficient to form beds of importance, as observed farther to the east. While there, the calcareous deposits have been interrupted at intervals, and form beds con- taining, to a considerable extent, fossils of different species, and distinct from those of the intercalated shales ; in this region, there are no strongly- marked changes in lithological or fossil characters. It must be remembered, however, that, for the most part, the species of fossils characteristic of the Clinton group, are wanting in all the localities examined. Less than one-tenth of those known in this group in New York, have been recognized on the shores of Lakes Huron and Michigan ; but, at the same time, we have not met with three well-marked new species,- -a less number pi obably than would be found, with equal examination, in the same beds in New York. Therefore, no new conditions of life have super- vened to change the fauna of this period, though a general paucity of or- ganic life is observed in the lower calcareous beds. Above the thin-bedded layers already noticed as containing, some fossils of the Clinton group, the beds gradually assume the semi-crystalline and somewhat cellular texture which is so characteristic of the limestones of this period. The Pentamerus beds often contain corals ; and, in a higher position, where this limestone has assumed the characters of the Niagara group, with its characteristic fossils, this shell is still found. The southern portion of Drummond's island is occupied by the Niagara -group : the beds are exposed along its eastern, western and southern sides, dipping southerly or south-westerly; and, at several places along the south- ern shore, the gently-sloping surfaces of the rock afford an abundance of fossils. In a single locality, we were enabled to see strata exposed to the thickness of twenty-five feet, charged with fossils, consisting chiefly of corals, among which are Catenipora escharoides, C. agglomerata, Syringo- pnra ? two species, and Heliolites spinipora. Favosites favosa, and F niagarensis, Astrocerium venustum, Stromatopora concentrica, Caninia, Diplophyllum, and several others, characteristic of the Niagara period. Among all these, the broken and separated valves of the Pentamerus ob- longus were very abundant. We were also enabled to trace the same group from the eastern end of Drummond's island across the southern extremity"], [470, "158 [4] of St. Joseph's, and thence along the coast and is/ands, from the mouth of the St. Mary's westward. In several of the localities, the rock has a lighter color than usually belongs to the Niagara group, and contains casts of a species of Pentamerus similar to one known at Gait, in Canada West. The rocks at Pointe St. Vital, and at other places in this neighborhood, have the aspect of the higher beds of the Niagara group, which evidently pass northward of Mackinac and Pointe St. Ignace. _ My observation upon beds of this period was again taken up along the coast in the neighborhood of Point Patterson, where I found similar rocks. Between this place and Pointe Seul Choix, strata of a similar character are again visible beneath the deposits of sand, which form the lake shore. At the latter place, the strata were examined by Messrs. Whittlesey and Desor, who found them to possess the same characteristic features and the same organic remains, among which the Pentamerus was the most conspicuous. Along the whole coast, from Point Patterson, the rocks at intervals only appear above the level of the lake, the water near the shore being shallow, and the bottom strewn over with numerous boulders of northern origin and fragments of limestone, little worn, indicating that the latter were derived from the immediate vicinity. . In many places, the rock may be seen be neath the water, with a very gradual slope towards the lake, and present /ng, for a long distance, a gently-sloping shore.* From Pointe aux Barques to Pointe Detour, the rock is more frequently seen above the lake-level, though rarely rising higher than five or six feet. It is extremely hard, resembling externally a highly silicious limestone ; /out, on analysis, it is found to contain only a small percentage of silica. The .nardness, or rather toughness, may then arise from the magnesia which is shown to be present everywhere in considerable proportions With the escarpments of the eastern shore of Big Bay des Noquets and Pointe Detour, the limestones of the Clinton and Niagara groups terminate upon the northern shore of Lake Michigan, and no traces of them are seen on the north or west shore of Green Bay. Their prolongation is in the direction of a group of small islands south-west from Pointe Detour, known as the Summer islands, St. Martin's, Rock, and Potawatomee islands, together with several small islets which have no distinctive name. The more elevated portions of many of these islands contain fossils of the Niagara group, consisting chiefly of corals, among which are two species of Favosites, Catenipora and Heliolites. These corals are chiefly above the great Pentamerus bed, in the lower part of the group ; but are, nevertheless, occasionally intermingled with that fossil, which even ranges into the higher portions of the Niagara group. The limestones belonging strictly to the Clinton group, and which have already been mentioned in that connection, exist along the west side of the peninsula of Green Bay, forming the shore as far as Sturgeon Bay, and even for a short distance beyond. At Potawatomee island, and along the * The bold, rocky shores, represented on the geographical maps as extending along the whole northern coast ofLako Michigan, are all imaginary. It is scarcely possible to find so great an extent of coast, with so few bold points and so little deep water, and equally rare to find one so dangerous of approach, even for coasting boats, during high winds. The gradual dip of the rocks lake-ward, broken occasionally in step-liko forms, produces shoal water, with irregular reefs. Upon these are accumulated the coarser drift materials. which often rise to within a few inches, or even quite to the surface of the water. The ac tion of the winds and the ice changes the distribution of these materials every year and even adds to them hy dislodging fragments of limestone from tho solid strata beneath. '"], [471, "159 [ 4 ] \"west side of the peninsula as far as Horse-shoe island, we find a consider able thickness of limestone belonging to the Niagara group. Beyond this point, however, we scarcely find it on the immediate shore, which, break ing off above or below the Pentamerus bed, recedes for some distance, when it rises with an abrupt slope, and even an escarpment, formed by the out-cropping edges of the Niagara beds. The whole of the interior, there fore, as well as the eastern side of the peninsula, is composed of strata of the Niagara group. As might be expected, this assemblage of strata (Niagara group) here assumes a very different external aspect from its equivalent in the New York series : and, although there is no difficulty in identifying the whole as a continuation ; yet, it is difficult to recognize subordinate members and individual beds. As an example of the variation in character, I will here give a section, in the ascending order, of the cliff of Big Bay des Noquets, where a thickness of about one hundred feet of the rock is exposed 1. Compact, hard, and apparently silicious limestone, forming the summit of the cliff\u2014 5 feet. 2. Friahle and porous limestone, resulting apparently, in part, from the solution and removal of some mineral matter\u2014 10 feet. 3. Thin, silico-argillaceous layers \u2014 10 feet. 4. Porous, friahle, and calcareous strata, charged with corals and imperfect remains of ether fossils, often cavernous \u2014 10 leet. 6. Thin-hedded, shaly limestone of a drab-color, with few fossils \u2014 25 feet. 6. A more porous and friable limestone, sub-crystalline, and containing corals \u2014 15 feet. 7. Shaly, thin-bedded limestone, with few fossils \u2014 thickness not ascertained. The manner of deposition is here made quite evident, in the character of the successive beds. The more purely calcareous ones, or those with no appreciable admixture of argillaceous matter, abound in corals, and appear to have been coral-reefs, scarcely disturbed in their natural position, but covered by sedimentary deposits, composed, in a great degree, of finely comminuted matter, probably derived from the remains of corals and other marine animals, intermingled with an argillaceous mud. In this deposit, or over the ocean bed, while it was being formed, no corals lived ; nor are there other fossils seen in this portion of the rock. Again, the condition is changed, and corals reappear and continue to flourish through a longer, or shorter period, until another change takes place, when they cease to exist ; and thus we meet with several repetitions of bands, charged with these remains, in this group. It is not probable that these reefs extended uninterruptedly over very wide areas, and we may expect to find them in one direction entirely re placed by shaly limestone, the materials composing it having been furnished in sufficient quantity to keep up a continued deposition, in some parts ; while, in others, these shaly materials, having been transported at intervals, may have allowed the uninterrupted growth of corals, and the formation of con tinuous reefs. Between these extremes, the two kinds of deposits may have been mingled in all degrees of proportion, and charged with a greater or less amount of corals, dependent on the quantity of intermingled shaly matter. To such conditions, we owe the production of different and successive beds in the same group, and the different aspects which the strata assume at remote points. Thus, the features of a group, which, in one place, are subordinate in importance, become, at another point, predominant. The"], [472, "[4] 160 shale which, in New York, forms more than one-third, and in places, more than one-half, of the thickness of the entire Niagara group, is nut recog nized in this district ; unless it be in the thin-bedded, shaly limestone, which ilternates with the coralline beds, or, in some places, forms a mass of con siderable thickness by itself, being destitute of all the larger corals, and fur xishiug only some of the characteristic shells. Notwithstanding all the changes which have taken place in the Niagara rroi.p, as developed at different poiats, and its intimate blending, as in this district, with the limestone of the Clinton group below and the Onondaga salt group above, we find no serious difficulty in recognizing it as a whole, jotlt by lithological characters and fossil remains. We have been able, by these characters combined, to trace its continuation throughout the entire district from east to west. We have seen it, in this extent, assuming dif ferent aspects, dependent on causes before adverted to ; but we have never ?ai]ed to find a greater or less number of known-characteristic fossils, even where the strata were explored only to a limited extent. Their occur rence, under such circumstances, and their persistence over so great an irea, where physical characters have in a great degree failed, only serve to demonstrate the value of these means of studying and identifying the strr.tified deposits. 1 have, also, had an opportunity of tracing this group, at intervals, across the country between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi river, and of recog nizing it by its fossils, particularly its corals, even beyond that point, to the souih-west. It exists in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee, and nay be recognized, not only by its lithological characters, but by its nu merous fossils, identical with those first described in the New York Geo logical Reports, as occurring in this group. Among these, we have, in iddition to the corals, which are the more common fossils, several species Df crinoids, the Caryocrinus, Eucalyptocrinus, Ichthyocrinus, and others which are identical with species known to occur in New York. In a south-westerly direction, and without the limits of this district, this group has been examined by Mr. I. A. Lapham, of Milwaukee, who has had no difficulty in recognizing it by its characteristic fossils. His observations will be found incorporated in the subsequent pages of this report. Thickness of the Miagara and Clinton Groups. \u2014 As already remarked in the commencement of this chapter, the lowest beds are seen at the lake leve'- on the eastern side of Drummond's island ; while, on the northern side, we find the higher beds of the Hudson-river group. Again, on the St. Mary's river, the lowest beds of the Clinton group come to the water-level just above Lime island. Passing westward, along the northern shore of Lak'i Michigan, although numerous undulations are visible, often enabling the observer to see a considerable thickness of strata, yet the lower beds are nowhere exposed, until we arrive at the bluffs on Big Bay des Noquets. I have already mentioned the exposure of the same beds here which we had seen on Drummond's island. The entire height of the cliffs does not exceed two hundred and fifty feet, and we have nowhere evidence of the existence of superior beds of more than one hundred feet in thickness be longing to these groups. The entire thickness, therefore, of thu calcareous bed:-; of the Niagara and Clinton groups does not exceed three hundred and fifty feet. This is, I am aware, somewhat less than the estimate of Mr. Murray, in his section across the Grand Manitoulin islands, which, inclu ling"], [473, "161 [4] both groups, amounts to five hundred and sixty feet.* Although there are, at intervals, exposures which appear along the coast, where the rate of dip is such as to give a greater estimated thickness than three hundred and fifty feet, yet we have no positive proof of a greater observed thickness. In this estimate, it must be understood that the elevated portions of the island and peninsula of Mackinac are not included, for they are occupied only to a small extent, if at all, by strata of this age. ONONPAGA SALT GROUP. It has already been stated in the preceding pages that, with the excep tion of Mackinac and St. Ignace, the northern shores of Huron and Michi gan, within this district, are low, and void of scenic interest. The whole extent, with the exception noticed, presents a single geological plateau from Drummond's island to Pointe Detour, the Niagara limestone everywhere forming a barrier to the encroachments of the 'lake ; and, though often covered by superficial accumulations upon the shore, it manifests itself in broken ledges beneath the water, or gives evidence of its presence in the accumulation of loose blocks, forming shallow water and dangerous reefs. With the exception of the points noticed, the superincumbent strata have been entirely removed from the surface of the Niagara limestone, along the entire distance, and even beyond this point nearly to Milwaukee. The succeeding strata in New York and Canada West belong to the Onondaga salt group, and consist of shales and marls, with some beds of more or less impure magnesian limestones. The shores of the island of Mackinac, and of some of the small islands to the east, present an abun dance of pebbles of light-drab or chocolate color, with the vesicular struc ture so characteristic of the Onondaga salt group. The lower beds of limestone, at Mackinac, have also this character ; while others have their surfaces marked by straight, gash-like lines, which have been described as appearing like shallow cuts made with an axe on a yielding surface. This feature, like the vesicular structure, is characteristic of this group. The north and west sides of the island present a good exposure of the lower beds, while the shore is strewed with fragments of this and the super incumbent group. The general ashen color of the whole renders the dis tinction obscure ; and the succeeding strata being for the most part destitute ' of fossils, or presenting them usually in an obscure condition, the observer fails at first to recognize the distinction. In the islands of St. Martin, a few miles to the north of Mackinac, it is reported that gypsum has been found in considerable quantities along the shore. At the time we visited the island, we did not succeed in discover mg 't, which may have been in consequence of a high stage of water. To the north of St. Ignace, Mr. Whittlesey found a marly bed about \"sty feet in thickness, containing gypsum in isolated masses, occurring under the same forms as in New York and Canada West. This marly bed, with some higher and more calcareous ones, undoubtedly represents the tmondaga salt group ; holding, in all respects, the same geological position and possessing the same lithological characters and the same association of funerals. The group has greatly diminished in thickness, and with its * Geological Survey of Canada, Report of Progress, 1847-48. Ex.-6"], [474, "[4] 162 small proportional importance, it is remarkable that it should retain, in so great a degree, its distinctive characters. We have not the means of making a comparison of its gradual changes as prolonged to the westward, this being the only place along the whole line of coast where we had an oppor tunity of seeing it. It is a single outlier, giving us the only facts by which to infer the character and persistency of the group, not only within the limits of this district, but farther to the south-west, along the peninsula of Green Bay, as far as Milwaukee, where we have some evidence to show that it has entirely thinned out. Returning, for a moment, to the island of Mackinac and the more ele vated positions of Pointe St. Ignace and Gros Cap, we find the marly beds succeeded by a brecciated limestone, composed of what appears to be thin argillo-calcareous beds, or lamin\u00e6, which often partially, or entirely, indu rated, have been broken up and mingled with a softer argillo-calcareous mud. It may be very appropriately termed a brecciated limestone.* This brecciated mass, in its lower parts, is composed of broken, thin-bedded limestone, like the higher layers of the Onondaga salt group\", or the thinly laminated beds connected with the gypsum deposits of New York and Canada West, which have been recemented by a calcareous mud. The fragments are presented in every possible attitude, as if broken up by the action of conflicting currents, though I was unable to detect the effects of anything like wearing action upon their edges. In the brecciated beds, I have been unable to find any traces of fossils ; but, in the succeeding strata, there occur numerous traces. I cannot but regard the brecciated mass as terminating the Onondaga salt group, or perhaps more properly, as marking the era of the commence- ment of the succeeding group, which, as will be shown, corresponds with the upper Helderberg limestones of New York. Coming here directly upon the former group, they show the absence of several important members which are well developed in the east. These consist of the Tentaculite, or Water limestone, the Pentamerus limestone, the Delthyris, or Shaly lime- stone, the Encrinal limestone, and the upper Pentamerus limestone, (con- stituting altogether the lower Helderberg series,) together with the Oris- kany sandstone and the Cauda-galli grit. All of these form well-marked , features in the geology of eastern New York, but are not recognized in the western portion of that state. These gaps in the succession also occur at Mackinac, so that the upper Helderberg series rests directly on the Onon- daga salt group. A long interval has, therefore, intervened between the termination of one group and the commencement of another, during which these absent members were deposited at a point farther east; and two dis- tinct faunas lived and died, without having left a trace of their existence in the region under consideration. It is greatly to be regretted that we have not an extended line of this brecciated limestone exposed, by which we might be able to form some con- jecture as to the conditions of the ocean-bed during this interval. In west- ern New York, the lower beds appear to have been undisturbed ; the upper member exhibiting an apparently water-worn surface, while the succeeding \u2022 The aspect of this rock is very similar to what may be seen, on a email scale, in conn tries wheie calcareous springs are abundant. The thinly-laminated and shaly limestone mingled with others of a more massive character, being broken up, becomes cemented together by the calcareous deposit from the springs, and forms a mass not mlike tome por tions of this limestone."], [475, "[4] 163 beds have been deposited conformably upon it. There appears, then, to be some evidence of ancient denudation, though there has been no opportunity of making connected observations. From the examinations of Mr. Lapham, already referred to, it appears that the Onondaga salt group, as a distinct member of the series, is not recognized at Milwaukee ; and from its greatly diminished thickness at Mackinac, we are warranted in concluding that it does not occur farther west; nor has it been recognized to the south or south-west of this point. Our present knowledge, therefore, of this group, shows that it is represented in its more easterly prolongation, by a thin band along the base of the Helderberg mountains and along the borders of the Hudson river. It is here the source of the immense supply of the hydraulic cement, conjointly, perhaps, with some of the thin beds below. Tracing it westwardly, we find it gradually expanding, until, in central New York, its vertical range is a thousand feet in thickness, where it becomes the repository of the gyp sum beds and the brine springs. From that point, westwardly, it can be traced, with a slightly diminished thickness, to the Niagara river, and throughout all of this range, it forms the strongly marked plateau, inter mediate between that formed by the Niagara group, and that by the upper Helderberg series. In the western part of that state, it is characterized by the presence of~beds of gypsum and of brine springs, though of little econo mical value, and of springs of sulphuric acid. In Canada West, the pro longation of- this group has been traced from the Niagara river to the shores of Lake Huron. It is there characterized, also, by the presence of gypsum and brine springs, and presents similar lifhological characters, though greatly attenuated in thickness. We have been unable, for reasons before assigned, to trace it uninterruptedly from the last named point into the limits of our district, having detected its presence only on the island of Mackinac and on Pointe St. Ignace. We shall indulge, at this time, in no speculations on the origin and influ ence of this immense deposit, which occurs in the midst of the upper Silu rian series, superimposed upon the Niagara and Clinton groups ; character ized, on the one hand, by at least three hundred species of fossils, peculiar to the upper Silurian, and, on the other, by a series of calcareous deposits marked by an equal number of distinct species of the same age. In the absence of the latter deposits, in this district, it marks a line of separation between the Niagara group and the upper Helderberg series, which at pre sent is regarded as of Devonian age. In the succeeding pages, we intend to consider the value and importance of these subdivisions, as they are pre sented to us in the United States. DEVONIAN SYSTEM UPPER. '.IELDERBERG SERIES. The Schoharie grit, the Onondaga and corniferous limestones form a well marked series known as the upper Helderberg limestones, and, according to the prevailing belief, as before remarked, are to be ranked as members of the Devonian system. Although not entirely coextensive with each other, they constitute a group which, perhaps, is more persistent and uniform in character than any in the United States. The lower member, where possessing its normal character, is a silicious limestone, becoming, in places, entirely calcareous ; and where"], [476, "[4] 164 it does not exist as a distinct member, some of its characteristic fossils may be found in the beds at the base of the next succeeding group. As a whole, it partakes of the character of the others in the increase of calcareous mat ter, as traced to the westward. The subdivisions, which are clearly defined in New York, cannot always be recognized farther west, and it therefore becomes desirable to speak of the whole collectively. In the district under consideration, the only points where these limestones have escaped the general denuding action are the island and the peninsula of Mackinac, where they form outliers of remarkable features. Resting on the marly beds of the Onondaga salt group, the brecciated limestone sup ports isolated, tower, or dome-shaped masses belonging to this group. The rapidity with which the underlying rock is decomposed and removed has a tendency to keep the base of the overlying rock smaller than the body of the mass. The effects of this decomposition and denudation are well illus trated at Gros Cap, on the west side of the peninsula of, Mackinac. (Vide Plate XVII.) The tower-like mass near the extremity of the point is only an outlier of the main body wThich skirts the shore, represented on the right side of the sketch. The wearing action of the water upon the base of this cliff is clearly indicated by its form ; and though, for the present, partly protected by the talus of fallen fragments, it is ultimately destined to be undermined and destroyed. The whole island of Mackinac is another example of this kind of denu dation, but on a more extended scale. The limestones of this group are in thin, irregular layers, such as would apparently result from deposition in a chopped sea. The lower beds are somewhat argillaceous, but, in ascending in the series, they become almost purely calcareous. The analyses show a very small percentage of magnesia, and, in this respect, it differs in a very remarkable degree from all the lower limestones, and particularly from those of the Niagara group. In its thin, cuniform lamin\u00e6, with shaly matter interposed between, it does not essentially differ from the limestone of the same age in the Helderberg range of New York. As particular examples of denuding action on the island, we would men tion \"The Arched Rock\" and \"The Sugar Loaf.\" The former, situatetl on the eastern shore, is a feature of great interest. The cliffs here attain a of nearly one hundred feet, while at the base are strown numerous height fragments which have fallen from above. The Arched Rock (Plate XVIII,) has been excavated in a projecting angle of the limestone cliff, and the top of the span is about ninety feet above the lake-level, surmounted by about ten feet of rock. At the base of a projecting angle, which rises up like a buttress, there is a small opening, through which an explorer may pass to the main arch, where, after clambering over the steep slope of debris and the projecting edges of the strata, he reaches the brow of the cliff. The beds forming the summit of the arch are cut off from direct con nection with the main rock by u narrow gorge of no great depth. The portion supporting the arch on the north side, anel the curve of the arch itself, are comparatively fragile, and cannot, for a long period, resist the action of rains and frosts which, in this latitude, and on a rock thus con stituted, produce great ravages every season. The arch, which on one side now connects this abutment with the main cliff, will soon be destroyed, as well as the abutment itself, and the whole be precipitated into the lake. It is evident that the denuding action, producing such an opening, with other attendant phenomena, could only have operated while near the level"], [477, "Plate XVII Acker-man L\u00abh379-BrDadway NY GRO CAP OF LAKE M1CHI DAN.'"], [478, ""], [479, ""], [480, ""], [481, ""], [482, "!"], [483, "165 [4] of a large body of water, like the great lake itself; and we find a striking similarity between the denuding action of the water here in times past, and the same action as now manifested in the range of the Pictured Rocks on the shores of Lake Superior. As an interesting point in the scenery of this island, the Arched Rock attracts much attention, and, in every respect, is worthy of examination. Evidences of erosive and undermining action are everywhere visible along the cliffs of the island. On the south and south-east side, the for mation of beaches and the accumulation of talus at their bases, have pre vented the encroachments of the lake, and protected the cliffs ; but, on the north-west side, where the winds have full sweep, the waves have under mined the strata, leaving overhanging cliffs above. On the plateau of the island, which may be one hundred and fifty or two hundred feet above the lake, there are other evidences of this character, in the occurrence of caverns and isolated columnar masses of limestone. The latter are, for the most part, of small magnitude, but there is one which is very conspicuous, and has received the name of \" Sugar-Loaf.\" (Plate XIX.) It is entirely isolated, and towers above the surrounding forest. In its rough and weathered contour, the lines of stratification are not so distinctly preserved in the sketch as they appear on close examination. It appears, at one time, to have formed a part of a continuous mass occupy ing the summit of the island ; if so, it gives a thickness of about three hundred feet to the limestones above the Onondaga salt group, which is greater than at any other point where I have examined them. It is scarcely to be conceived, however, that such a mass as the Sugar-Loaf could have been transported to its present position by those agencies which have dispersed the boulders ; nor is it necessary to resort to such a sup position ; for, immediately west, the ground attains a higher elevation than its summit ; and, although the underlying rock is concealed by drift, it undoubtedly is of the same character. This assemblage of strata which was termed by Dr. Houghton, in his survey of Michigan, the \"Mackinac limestone,\" although separated from all of the limestones of the northern peninsula, except that of Pointe St. Ignace and Gros Cap, can, nevertheless, be identified with that of the southern peninsula of Canada West, and of New York, as well as with that of the states to the west and south-west. From its known thickness, in all these places, its apparently increased thickness on the island of Mackinac is the more surprising. Our knowledge of this group, at the present time, enables us to conclude, with great certainty, that the whole formed, at one time, an immense coral reef; and, at intervals, it is abun- dantly charged with their remains. It is occasionally intermixed with sili , cious layers, or nodules, in the form of chert, and also with argillaceous mud, which apparently proved unfavorable to the growth of the larger corals ; but the smaller ones, with numerous Bryozoa and shells, appear to have flourished. So far as I observed, the island of Mackinac and the adjoining coast, furnish few of the larger corals, though Favosites and many species of Cyathophyllide\u00e6 are common. Farther south, however, in the neighbor hood of Presqu'isle, on the western shore of Lake Huron, where the upper beds of this group come to the level of the water, the corals largely pre dominate, and the conditions of the ocean appear to have been highly favorable to their growth and development."], [484, "166 [4] In collecting fossils about this island, one is liable to be deceived in regard to the character of the rocks, since it often happens that those of the Ni agara group have found their way among the loose materials which have been transported from the northern shore. Thus, the Catenipora, Heliolites, and other corals of the Niagara group may be picked up at the base of these cliffs, associated with those which have fallen from the cliffs above. As a general remark, however, it may be stated that the fossils of the Ni agara are much oftener silicified than those of the group under consideration. Owing to this fact, it might readily be inferred, without careful comparison, that the Niagara group existed on the island of Mackinac and on the pe ninsula to the north-west. Notwithstanding, however, the great similarity in aspect and color, they are very different in their chemical composition and their associated organic remains. Most of the fossils collected at Mackinac prove to be undescribed, but are identical, however, with species which occur in the same rocks in New York. Some of the smaller bryozooid corals belong to the genus Tremato pora and Cladopora, while two or more species of Favosites were ob served. A few shells only were collected, and these, with a single excep tion, belong to the Brachiopoda. Among the trilobites was a Phacops, resembling P. bufo and a species of Proetus, both apparently identical with species which occur in the upper Helderberg range. One of the most characteristic species, however, is the Phacops anchiops, characteristic of the Schoharie grit. The specimens of the latter fossil, though consisting only of portions of two bucklers, are so peculiarly characteristic, that I cannot doubt the identity in age of these widely-separated localities. Al though it would have been desirable to identify a larger number of fossils with those occurring in the corresponding series elsewhere, yet the evidence is sufficient to remove this group from any below the Oriskany sandstone."], [485, "[4] 167 CHAPTER XL MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS ON THE PAL\u00c6OZOIC SERIES.

Having given a descriptive account, in the last three chapters, of the range and extent of the several groups of the pal\u00e6ozoic series which occur in our district, and described their mineral characters and organic remains, group by group, we next propose to offer some general remarks upon the assem blage of groups, their thickness, bearing, and inclination, the varying con ditions of the ocean in which they were deposited, and the extensive denu dation to which they have, in comparatively recent times, been subjected. These remarks, from the variety of topics embraced in this chapter, must necessarily be somewhat discursive in their character ; but, at the same time, they may serve to illustrate some of the most interesting features in the geology of our district. CONTINUATION OP THE PAL\u00c6OZOIC SERIES IN WISCONSIN. To illustrate, still further, the succession of the pal\u00e6ozoic groups, as developed in the north-west, we introduce the subjoined section and de scription by Mr. I. A. Lapham, of Milwaukee, a gentleman who has made numerous and extended observations on the geology of this portion of the Silurian basin. This contribution of Mr. Lapham is the more valuable, since it serves to fill up a blank between the Lake Superior and Chippewa districts. Although his nomenclature of the groups is somewhat different from that adopted by us, there is little difficulty in identifying them with their equivalents in our district. \"On the Geology. of the south-eastern portion of the State of Wisconsin; being the part not surveyed by the United States Geologists, in a letter to J. W. Foster, by I. A. Lapham of Milwaukee. In answer to the several inquiries in your letter, relating to the rocky strata in the south-eastern portion of the State of Wisconsin, I cannot, per-"], [486, "168 [4] Section from Milwaukee to Janesville, Wisconsin \u2014 By LA. Lapham."], [487, "169 [4] haps, do better than to exhibit and explain the accompanying section (Fig. 20) from near Milwaukee, on Lake Michigan, to Janesville on Rock river. I. The Inferior, or Potsdam Sandstone, is found at Janesville and above, occupying the bed of the river. The grains are rounded, smooth, and without apparent cement ; the rock easily crumbles upon exposure ; color white or red. The white variety might be used for the manufacture of glass. The discovery, in 1849, of that singular and characteristic fossil described by Mr. Hall as Scolithus linearis (New York Pal. Vol. I. p. 2), in this rock, in Sauk county, may be considered as settling the question of the identity of this rock with the Potsdam sandstone of the New York reports. It occupies much of the counties Marquette and Columbia, enters Dane county, and is seen in the banks of Rock river from Lake Koshko nong to Janesville. The \"granite quarries,\" so called at Portland, in Dodge county, prove to be a metamorphic sandstone, and not a true granite. It consists almost wholly of quartz ; and for building purposes, it ranks with the granites, and passes generally by that name. n. Calciferous Rock of Eaton. \u2014 Resting immediately upon the sand stone, at Janesville, is a limestone with grains of the same sand inter mixed, giving it the form and appearance of an oolite limestone ; the amount of sand diminishing as you rise from the surface of the sandstone. It accords exactly with the description given of a portion of the calciferous sandstone of New York, and contains the same fucoid, (Pal\u0153ophycus tubu laris,) as well as other characteristic fossils. Its character and relative position also clearly show that it is the same rock that, further west and north, is called the lower magnesian limestone, by Drs. Owen and Locke. ni. The Blue, or Trenton limestone, is here, as in the more western districts, a very thin layer, often penetrated in digging wells, &c. It pre sents everywhere its characteristic fossils, and is too well known to need further notice. The upper sandstone, noticed by Dr. Owen, does not appear on the east side of Rock river. IV. The Galena limestone. At Diamond Grove, and also at Fort Atkin son and White-water, is found the true lead-bearing rock, with fossils of the same kind as those brought out with the rubbish at the lead-mines. It is a soft, yellowish, magnesian limestone, very fully described in the report of the United States Geologists for 1839, as well as by Mr. Hodge and others, at an earlier day. It is usually identified, in distant localities, by the occur rence of a peculiar fossil coral, resembling the Coscinopora sulcata of Gold fuss, the tubes of which are sometimes filled with lead. The connection of this rock with the superior strata is unfortunately obscured by large de posits of drift, so that its exact geological age cannot be clearly made out. Judging, however, from the fossils, we may assign to it a place coeval with, or immediately succeeding, the blue limestone. It may, perhaps, be regarded as a portion of the same formation ; at any rate, it is much more ancient than the true geodiferous, or cliff limestone, to which it has usually been referred. In this part of the state, it does not contain lead, or other ores, except in limited quantities. V. Sandstone? \u2014 -Before we reach the rock next to be described, we find, at various places, a narrow strip of sandy land, with occasional frag ments of hard, red, slaty sandstone ; thus indicating that there may be a layer of sandstone here, concealed beneath the drift. Such places have been observed from Kenosha to La Belle lake in the north-western corner o|"], [488, "[4] 170 Waukesha county ; but, as no sandstone has been seen in place, its existence may be considered doubtful. VI. Waukesha Limestone. \u2014 Throughout the county of Waukesha, is found a hard, white, or bluish-white limestone, which, as it appears to be new, I propose to call the Waukesha limestone. It forms an excellent and beautiful building material, being disposed in regular layers from a few inches to a foot or more in thickness. It does not, however, receive a good polish, being in many places filled with small, irregular cavities, occasioned probably by the decay of some mineral substance. It contains but few fossils : the most remarkable are two large species of Orthocera. These, with a spiral-chambered shell and a Trilobite, are all that have been disco vered. The Waukesha limestone extends eastward along the Menomonee* river of lower Wisconsin, to within three miles of Milwaukee, where it is extensively quarried for building purposes in the city. At this point it is only thirty-three feet above the level of Lake Michigan, while at the vil lage of Waukesha, twelve miles west, it has an elevation of about two hundred and fifty feet. VII. A Soft, yellow limestone is found on the Menomonee river of southern Wisconsin, resting immediately upon the Waukesha limestone. The same rock occurs near Racine, and at other points on Root river ; also at the Menomonee falls and at the falls of the Milwaukee river in Washing ton county. It may be considered as only the lower portion of the next rock. VIII. The geodiferous limestone of Eaton, or Niagara limestone of the New York reports. \u2014 This rock is very well characterized, and exhi bits many of the fossils of the geodiferous rock of Lockport and the Nia gara falls. Its hardness, numerous cavities, or geodes, its want of regular stratification, as well as its pal\u00e6ontological character, all go to show its identity with that rock. It extends, with some interruptions, along the whole length of Lake Michigan from Chicago to Porte des Morts, the en trance of Green Bay. In the vicinity of Milwaukee, it is well developed, and affords an excellent material for the manufacture of lime. Both the Niagara and Clinton groups of New York appear to be represented in Wis consin by this one limestone. The extensive beds of oolitic iron ore, found in Dodge and the western part of Washington counties, are connected with a limestone supposed to be the same as that now under consideration. IX. A shaly limestone is found at one locality, representing some of the formations that, in New York, are interposed between the geodiferous and the corniferous limestones. X. Corniferous Limestone of Eaton. \u2014 The most recent of the rock formations, properly so called, found any where in Wisconsin, is the lime stone that, at Louisville, Columbus, and Sandusky, lies immediately below the black shale ; being the upper part of the cliff, and corresponding with the corniferous limestone of Eaton, as found in the state of New York. This is known by its position, as well as its lithological and fossil characters. It occupies the shore of Lake Michigan and the bed of the Milwaukee river, for several miles above its mouth, but does not extend far towards the interior. Hydraulic limestone is found associated with it at Louisville and other places. This and the last preceding rocks occupy but a small extent of surface in this state. * This is not to be confounded with the Menomonee of Green Bay."], [489, "[4] 171 The black, bituminous shale (Ma reels us shale of the New York reports) is found in numerous fragments in the drift near Milwaukee ; thus indicating that it formerly existed at no great distance ; but it has nowhere been found in place. Connecting these observations with those of Drs. Owen and Locke on the west, it will be seen that there is an anticlinal axis extending along the valley of Rock river, from which the strata are inclined eastwardly towards Lake Michigan, and westwardly towards the Mississippi. Rock river, therefore, has a geological position quite analogous to that of Cincinnati ; the only difference being, that there, the blue limestone is the lowest rock, while in Wisconsin there are two or three groups below it. It will be seen, also, that Lake Michigan occupies (like Lake Superior) an ancient basin, of which the hard geodiferous limestone forms the edge or rim. The soft, shaly strata that, in Indiana, Ohio, and New York, occupy the next succeeding geological periods, appear to have been swept away to make room for the waters of the present lake. This is more fully illustrated in the accompanying diagram (Fig. 21.)\" Fig'. 21. Section across the Basin of Lake Michigan. 1. Waukesha limestone. 3. A soft, shaly limestone. 2. Hard, geodiferous limestone. 4. Shales. It will thus be perceived that the observations of Mr. Lapham verify, in almost every particular, those which have been incorporated in the preced ing pages. They show the necessity of recognizing, throughout the whole northern range of the pal\u00e6ozoic groups, from New York to the Mississippi, essentially the same subdivisions. Since the foregoing communication was received, Mr. Lapham has sent us some additional facts which serve to illustrate his general views. He states that, on penetrating the limestone on the top of the ridge above the iron ore, fossils of the Niagara age have been obtained, and, also, that be low the iron ore at Hartford and at the Iron ridge, as well as at the north east corner of Lake Winnebago, a soft, blue shale has been found ; thus corroborating the view taken by Mr. Hall, as to the age and position of this ore, though he was unable to trace its connection with the rocks, abfeve and below. With reference to Mr. Lapham's section, Mr. Hall remarks : \" The sand stone, No. V., conjecturally marked, holds the place of the Hudson-river group, Medina sandstone, and the lower, or arenaceous part of the Clinton group. It is not improbable that a meagre representation of these may occur in the line of the section, since our observations on the shore of Green Bay would prepare us to expect such a condition here ; besides, the iron ore and shale of the Clinton group have been traced to within a short dis tance of the line of the section. I am inclined to regard the Waukesha limestone, No. VI., the soft,"], [490, "[ 4 ] 172 yellow limestone, No. VII., and the geodiferous limestone, No. VIII., as constituting the Niagara, and the calcareous portion of the Clinton group. The Waukesha limestone, as I saw it near Milwaukee, is a thin-bedded, argillaceous deposit containing few fossils ; I collected from it, however, Or thoceras undulatum, and 0. virgatum. I saw the same in Mr. Lapham's cabinet, with another species from this member of the series ; also, a species of Gomphoceras, like that occurring in the Niagara shale at Rochester and in the limestone at Niagara falls (Pal. N. Y. II. , p. 290) ; also, Spirifer lineata, and a flattened Trochus-like shell, similar to a species occurring in a limestone of this age on Lake Michigan ; and a species of Cyrtoceras, and Calymene Blumenbachii, var. niagarensis. Among the fossils from the lower geodiferous limestone, in Mr. Lapham's cabinet, I saw Favosites nia garensis, F.favosa, or striata, Diplophyllum, crinoidal joints, Caryocrinus ornatus, Eucalyptocrinus decorus ? and Orthoceras undulatum. From the upper geodiferous limestone, there were the two species of the Favosites just mentioned, with a third one ; two species of Heliolites, Ca tenipora escharoides and C. agglomerata, Sarcinula ? Diplophyllum, Cysti phyllum, Stromatopora concentrica, Pentamerus oblongus, Pentamerus, n. sp., Spirifer niagarensis, Atrypa reticularis, A. obtusiplicata, Orthis hy brida, Orthoceras undulatum, Calymene Blumenbachii, var. niagarensis, Bumastis barriensis, Ceraurus insignis and Sph\u0153rexochus \u2014 ? All these, with one or two exceptions, are known Niagara species, leaving no doubt as to the age of this limestone, wdiich, in its lithological characters, \u2014 also having cavities lined with crystals \u2014 resembles the Niagara. The fossils of the corniferous limestone, No. X., in Mr. Lapham's col lection, are mostly undescribed species. Among them, however, I recog nized Phacops bufo, an Avicula, like one in the Scoharie beds, and an acephalous bivalve shell, similar to, if not identical with, one in the Sco harie grit. In their general characters, the fossils from this group resemble those of the upper Helderberg series of New York ; and, though I had no opportunity of making a direct comparison of specimens to prove their iden tity, it is, nevertheless, certain that they are unlike any of the known species of the Niagara group. Admitting this to be true, the shaly limestone of Mr. Lapham's section represents the Onondaga salt group, which, however, has so far thinned out as to be of little importance. I had no opportunity of seeing the two last members in place ; but the specimens of the shaly limestone are very simi lar to the thin layers of hydraulic limestone in the upper part of the Onon daga salt group of western New York. The higher limestone, a few feet only in thickness, as seen at Milwaukee, when compared with its thickness, as developed along the northern extre mity of Lake Michigan, shows either a rapid diminution, or an enormous denudation ; the latter is probably true.\" In order still farther to illustrate the geology of this part of Wisconsin, we append a section across the formations, from the granite to the summit of the upper Silurian, by Mr. Whittlesey."], [491, "[4] 173 Section from Wolf River, Wisconsin, to Lake Michigan. \u2014 By Charles Whittlesey."], [492, "174 [4] Remarks upon the Section from the Falls of Wolf River, through Nava- rino to Lake Michigan. By Charles Whittlesey. Formation 1. Igneous Rocks. \u2014 In 1849, while connected with the survey of the Chippewa land district, in Wisconsin, I penetrated from Green Bay, across the sedimentary beds, to the borders of the igneous rocks, ascending the Oconto river, and crossing westward to the falls of the Wolf river. Previous to that time, Messrs. Ellis and Conkey, of Green Bay, United States deputy surveyors, had subdivided a tract west of the Menomonee river, as far as range 20 east, and north to township 38, at the Big Bekuenesec falls, and had collected specimens of the rocks for the Land Office. The surveyed district extends no farther into' the interior than the sources of the Oconto, and the falls of Wolf river ; so that that part of Wisconsin beyond these points is, as yet, unexplored. The falls, which consist of a series of chutes, descend twenty-one feet, besides intermediate rapids, in the distance of one and a half miles. At these falls there is an abundance of excellent, red, coarse-grained syenite, which passes, in some places, into granite. This rock rises above the banks of the stream, attain ing, in some places, an elevation of fifty feet, and is covered by heavy deposits of drift. This is in township 28 north, range 15 east. On the Oconto, in township 31 north, ranges 16 and 17 east, the same red syenite and syenitic granite are seen, and are there overlaid by the Potsdam sandstone ; they extend westward and northward for a distance of ten or twenty miles. For the detailed description of these rocks, the reader is referred to my report to Dr. D. D. Owen. Between the Oconto and the Menomonee, according to Messrs. Ellis and Conkey, the country is occupied by syenite, granite, hornblende-rock, greenstone, and trappean rocks. No. 2. Potsdam Sandstone. \u2014 The junction of this rock with the under lying igneous masses, is nowhere visible. The sandstone is here exceed ingly friable, so that it may generally be easily crushed between the fingers, there being no cement between the silicious grains. For this reason it has been extensively denuded, so that, here and there only, a trace of its former existence is still left remaining. The exact line of junction between the sandstone and the granite, is covered by drift, both on the Menomonee, the Oconto, and the Wolf rivers. The sandstone is visible in township 28 north, range 18 east, on the Oconto ; in township 22 north, ranges 15 and 16 east, near the Wolf river ; and in township 16 north, range 12 east, between the Fox river and Green lake. No. 3. Calciferous Sandstone. \u2014 The junction of this rock with the Pots dam sandstone was seen and examined by Mr. Hall, at Pleasant Valley, Wisconsin, township 16 north, range 12 east ; and also by myself in town ship 22 north, ranges 15 and 16 east ; but its upper limit was nowhere clearly recognized. The exposure at the falls of the Oconto in the south east part of township 28 north, range 19 east, is probably near the junction of this rock with the Chazy and Birds-eye limestones ; no fossils were ob- served here. No. 4. Chazy, Birds-eye and Trenton Limestones. \u2014 Whether a division can properly be made between these three groups, as recognized in New York, is not yet determined, and I have, therefore, included them under"], [493, "[4] 175 one number. There is no distinction recognizable in them from their litho logical characters, and too few fossils have been, as yet, discovered to allow of their being classed according to the pal\u00e6ontological evidence. There is no difficulty in fixing the upper limit of the Trenton limestone, either by its fossils or from its lithological characters. The soft, marly beds of the Hudson-river group, or \"blue limestone,\" rest directly upon the Trenton limestone, and their lithological character has had a marked influ ence on the topographical features of the country west of Green Bay. The bay itself, as well as the low, flat country which gently declines towards it, from the west, have resulted from the denudation of this group by drift agencies ; the hard Trenton limestone, which now occupies the surface, did not yield to the denuding effect, while the blue, soft marls were easily excavated and removed. No. 5. Hudson-river Group, Blue Limestone and Marls, of the Ohio Reports. \u2014 This group, which is seen at Bay des Noquets, on the west side of Green Bay, passes obliquely along its bed and appears on the eastern shore, and at its southern extremity. No. 6. Clinton Group. \u2014 This group is well-defined and easily traced, from Big Bay des Noquets, along the small islands, between Chambers's island and the eastern shore of Green Bay ; thence, as seen by Mr. Hall, on the eastern shore, near Sturgeon Bay ; again, in the bluffs west of \" Des Peres\" (Depere or Depeer), and farther south-west, on the bluffs which overhang Lake Winnebago, on the east. It is nowhere a thick, or heavy bed, but is well known for the beautiful white lime which it furnishes. No. 7. Niagara Group. \u2014 It is not yet determined whether there should be a higher formation, or formations, represented on the line of this section ; but what is included here under the head of the Niagara group, probably embraces two of the next superior beds of the New York system. By re ference to Mr. Lapham's section, it will be seen what are his views and observations respecting this division. My section strikes Lake Michigan in township 22 north, range 24 east, about twelve miles north of Twin rivers, and near where Mr. Lapham places the lower face of the \" geodiferous lime-rock.\" This group presents another instance of the intimate connec tion between the geological structure and- the topographical features of a country. The Niagara limestone, consisting of a close, compact and dura ble mass, overlies the marly beds of No. 6, and the yielding strata of No. 7, protecting them from erosion. It presents a series of mural fronts along the bay, facing the north-west, while its surface declines gently with the dip towards Lake Michigan, exactly in the same manner as the Trenton does towards the bay. For the particulars of the dip and thickness of these formations, the reader is referred to another portion of this chapter, where I have discussed this subject, embracing all the rocks of the north and wes shore of Lake Michigan. a. a. Red Clay and Drift. \u2014 As above remarked, there are, on the line of the section between the Wolf river and Green Bay, extensive deposits of northern drift. The drift hills about the head of the Oconto and around Shawanse lake, are discussed in the report on Wisconsin. From the falls of Wolf river, southerly, beds of red clay occur, inter stratified with the coarse drift : they become more heavy and numerous, as we proceed towards Green Bay, until, at Appleton, the red clay consti tutes the mass of the superficial deposits. It is there about one hundred feet thick, and rests on the Trenton limestone (No. 4), as at Navarino. At"], [494, "[4] 176 this place, it passes beneath the surface of the waters of Green Bay ; and here are sunk the wells, of which the details of the borings will be found in the Appendix. Passing over the crest formed by the Niagara limestone at Lake Winne- bago, the same clay and drift beds continue most of the way to Sheboygan. Their thickness is very considerable, but their extent on the line of this section is not known. At Green Bay, as at Lake Winnebago, it occurs in patches, filling the depressions in the stratified rocks, at various elevations from the level of the water to the top of the bluff. From Sheboygan, I have traced it to the southward, and found it gradually changing to a pur ple, and finally becoming a blue clay like that of Lake Erie ; I am, there fore, satisfied that all these varieties of clay belong to one formation. ORIGIN OF THE BASINS OP LAKES MICHIGAN AND HURON. It has been generally supposed that the immense depressions which con stitute the basins of Lakes Michigan and Huron, and which reach below the ocean level, had their origin in great, transverse fissures, or dislocations of the strata. The evidence, collected during the progress of this survey, shows conclusively that this has not been the case, but that, on the con trary, they must be regarded rather as the result of an extensive denudation and excavation of the more yielding strata, and that there is no evidence of any system of faults or dislocations in the region occupied by them. Mr. Hall has summed up the evidence with regard to this point, in the following remarks : \" From the examination of this region, it appears that Lake Michigan has been, to a great extent, excavated from the Onondaga salt group and the upper Helderberg series, while the Niagara limestone, being harder and more indestructible, forms its western border, from one extremity to the other. From the breadth of country over which we find vestiges of the Onondaga salt group and the upper Helderberg series, in the northern parts of Lakes Huron and Michigan, we are warranted in the conclusion that at least two-thirds of the latter lake, in a direction conforming to its trend, has been excavated from these limestones. The eastern portion of Michi gan is in the shaly sandstones, which are superior to the upper Helderberg series, corresponding to the beds No. 4, in Mr. Lapham's diagram (Fig. 21). These observations, to a great extent, are applicable to Lake Huron. The Niagara limestone there forms a barrier, occasionally broken through, extending along its northern shore, embracing Cabot's Head and the Grand Manitoulin islands. It dips southerly, so as to leave the Onondaga salt group and the upper Helderberg series to the south ; and the area once oc cupied by them is now covered by the waters of this lake. _ Thus, the beds of these two great lakes occupy precisely the same posi tion with regard to the geological series, having been excavated in the same beds, and occupying opposite sides of a low, synclinal axis. The basins of these lakes have not been caused by any upheaval of the strata, except so far as the whole country has been raised, by which these strata were brought within the operation of denuding forces. Whatever of evidence there may be eTsewhere of the effects of a denu ding force operating in an eastern and western direction, it appears to me, in"], [495, "177 [4] these examples, we have the most conclusive proof of a force having acted from north to south. In this direction, the lakes have been excavated in the trend of the strata ; while the same groups, equally exposed, and as easily destroyed, are left as outliers, almost continuous, in the neighbor hood of Mackinac. We can only account for this fact, on the supposition that the shales and the shaly sandstones of the southern peninsula afforded a more resisting bar rier to the denuding forces, which were turned to the right and the left. The water, the chief agent of excavation, found here a more ready outlet, and swept before it, in its resistless force, the excavated materials from these basins, while the northern point of this peninsula is left covered with the finer sediments derived from-the destruction of the sandstones. To form a correct idea of the force of this argument, the observer should place before him a map of the United States, and upon it indicate, by a colored band, the range of the Niagara group, from the peninsula of Green Bay, southward along the western border of Lake Michigan, and extending inland to a width twenty-five or thirty miles, and he will have a pretty correct idea of the geological position of the lake. Let him represent, by a parallel band, differently colored, the Onondaga salt group and upper Helderberg series, and he will observe that the lake now covers very nearly their ancient limits. Again, on the east, protract the Niagara limestone, from Drummond's island along the southern part of the Mani toulin group, and thence, by Cabot's Head, towards Lake Erie, and we will find that the same observations are true with regard to Lake Huron. The continuation of the Onondaga salt group and upper Helderberg limestones, from the peninsula of Canada West, in the direction of Mackinac, is interrupted by the lake basin. At Thunder Bay, on the western shore of Lake Huron, we have the occurrence of the upper Helderberg limestones, while Cabot's Head, on the opposite coast, is occupied by the Niagara group, giving the interme diate space as the width once occupied by the superior groups, but which have been removed by denudation. The direction and contour of these lakes, then, have resulted from the bearing and the yielding character of the beds which once occupied the watery surface ; but, towards the north, their irregular and broken outline has resulted from the destruction, in places, of the shaly beds below the Niagara group. These general observations apply with equal force to the lower lakes \u2014 Erie and Ontario.\" We here offer the results of Mr. Whittlesey's observations on the thick ness, area, dip, &c, of the pal\u00e6ozoic groups described in the foregoing chapters. They may be regarded as approximations ; but entire accuracy, where the whole thickness of the groups is nowhere exposed, is unattain able. The Dip, Bearing, and Thickness of the Silufian Groups* By Mr. Whittlesey* \" The inclination of the sedimentary rocks of the peninsula between lakes Huron and Michigan on the south, and Lake Superior on the north is very slight, but regular."], [496, "1 [4] 178 J In groups like these, possessing similar external characters, it is difficult to identify beds and lines of stratification at remote points, and therefore not easy to determine their exact dip ; but, where this can be done with accuracy, over large areas, it is a plain mathematical problem to determine their precise thickness. ' On no part of the north shore of Lake Michigan did we discover lines of strata m the limestones which could be safely said to be continuous for many miles together. From the superior face of the lower, or Potsdam sandstone, to the top of the Mackinac limestone \u2014 a vertical thickness of at least one thousand feet \u2014 the beds are entirely cal careous ; and although these beds may be separated, without great difficulty, into geological groups, the lines of separation can only be fixed approxi matively. For the purposes of measurement, something more precise is desirable. Along the western shore of the St. Mary's river, the Potsdam, or lower sedimentary rock, is seen, with the Birds-eye and Trenton limestones superimposed, succeeded by the Clinton and Niagara groups; but dividing lines have not been discovered and probably do not exist. These groups, with the exception of the sandstone, graduate into each other, and are recognizable, not so much by lithological characters as by their included fossils. All observations agree in showing that the outcrop, or edges of these groups are curved, and that the convexity is towards the north. Between Lakes Superior and Michigan the lines which indicate the bounda ries of the rocks will be seen on the map, where the breadth of each sub division is indicated by an appropriate color. These bands are concentric, their outlines being rudely parallel, and the curves approaching in form an ellipse, of which the greater axis is east and west. In theory, the general direction of the dip is known at once, when the line of outcrop is determined ; for if, as in the present case, the rocks are not disturbed by\" upheavals and the country is comparatively level, the dip is at right angles to the line of bearing \u2014 the one being a radius and the other a tangent to the curve of outcrop. The radius of curvature in the strata which encircle the northern shores of Huron and Michigan proceeds from a point at, or near, the centre of the lower penin sula of Michigan, where the greatest depression of these beds will be found ; consequently,' as might have been predicted, it is at that point that the most recent groups are seen, such as the coal-seams, shales and sandstones of the carboniferous era, occupying the deepest depression in the great geological ba.sin of Lakes Huron and Michigan. The observations of this season complete the circuit of the Silurian groups of the northern part of the United States, connecting, through the upper peninsula of Michigan, those of New York and Canada on the east, with those of Wisconsin and Minnesota on the west. These groups, in the northern peninsula, known as the Lake Superior district, are rarely exposed, being covered by thick deposits of drift, sus taining a heavy growth of timber ; but, along the coast, where it is inter sected by inlets and bays, the rocks are sufficiently exposed to enable us-to determine their outlines with sufficient exactness for general purposes. Since they are the repositories of none of the valuable metals, minute ac curacy in this respect is of no practical importance. Taking Mackinac as a starting point, where the inclination of tne strata is south and the bearing east ana -west, and proceeding thence westwardly,"], [497, "[4] 179 we should expect to see a change m the direction of the line of dip, and our local observations confirmed this expectation ; for their dip was found to vary regularly towards the eastward, until, on reaching Point Detour, at Great Bay des Noquets, it was found to be nearly south-east. Following the coast past Death's door, or Porte des Morts, to Sheboygan and Mil waukee, where the Niagara limestone forms a sea-wall, the dip is observed to become more easterly, until, at the latter place, according to the obser vations of Mr. Lapham, it becomes due east. As regards the amount of dip, I have already adverted to the difficulty of making a correct estimate. We have had, however, some good oppor tunities of calculating the amount over large areas, where the observations were worthy of credit. The surface of the Potsdam sandstone is well defined, being overlaid by a rock \u2014 the calciferous sandstone \u2014 widely dif ferent in external characters ; but it has not been practicable, with the means at our command, to take accurate levels of all the points where it would be desirable. We have the means of making tolerable estimates of its elevation at several points, connecting it, by short levels, with lakes and rivers whose altitude is pretty correctly determined. For the other elements of the cal culation, viz : courses and distances, nothing is wanting, for we have the aid of the linear surveyors, who have subdivided a large portion of the ter ritory into tracts of a mile square. Before entering upon the general dip of the several groups, we will pro ceed to notice some minor deviations and irregularities. Local Dips. \u2014 From Saut Ste. Marie, along the western bank of the St. Mary's river and the straits of Mackinac, as far as St. Martin's Bay, no good opportunity occurs of estimating the dip of the strata. Wherever they are exposed, the lines of bedding are indistinct and by no means con tinuous. There is, however, evidently a slight inclination to the south. On the east side of St. Martin's Bay, there is a local dip to the S.S.W. of thirty or fifty feet to the mile, but, at the mouth of Pine river, it changes to the south or south-east. At the mouth of Carp river, on the west side of the bay, another irregularity is observed. At the first rapid, one-fourth of a mile from its mouth, it is from 1\u00b0 to 2\u00b0 N.E. by N. Ascending the stream, the strata become horizontal, but, farther up, a mile from its mouth, the dip becomes reversed, being S.W. by W., but is very slight. The bold, rocky cliffs of St. Ignace show a perceptible inclination to the south, but no well-defined lines, capable of being measured, are observed. The same may be said of the coast line, as far as Seul Choix. Here, the upper face of the Pentamerus member of the Niagara group has a marked undulation, the axis of which is nearly north-west and south-east. From Pointe aux Chenes to the last mentioned place, the rock is seldom observed to rise above the surface, and the inference is, that, within this distance, there is no irregularity in the inclination, for the irregular outline of the coast seems to be due, in the main, to this cause. At the extremity of the Pointe Seul Choix, the dip is 2\u00b0 south-east, the strata gradually bending around to the southward ; but, about a mile far ther west, they are observed to plunge, at first, S. 60\u00b0E. 6\u00b0, and still farther west, S. E. 7\u00b0; thence S. E. 5\u00b0; and at the harbor, S. 25\u00b0 W. 7\u00b0 ; and one mile west of the harbor, S. W. 3\u00b0. Eight miles west of Seul Choix, I had the first opportunity of measuring the dip on a smooth flat surface of the limestone, and found it to be S. 30\u00b0 E. |\u00b0. Thenee, to the"], [498, "C 4 ] 180 Manistee river, a slight, but regular dip was observed to the south-east. At the mouth of this river, and at Indian lake, on the west fork, as well as the rapids between the two points, there was a very perceptible and uniform dip to the south-east, varying from \u00a3\u00b0 and \u00a3\u00b0 to 1\u00b0 Up the main stream, as far as the north boundary of township 44, range 13, the rocks are 4oo indistinctly exposed to determine their inclination. Four miles westwardly of the Manistee, the southerly dip is very slight ; at Orthoceras Point, twenty miles S. W., it is a few degrees to the east of south, and at Pointe Detour, it is still more easterly, but subject to a local undulation \u2014 proba bly a repetition of that at Seul Choix. On the east side of the point, the plunge is S. E. 2\u00b0, at the extremity S. 1\u00b0, but, on the west side, it is from \u00a3\u00b0 to 1\u00b0 to the S. W. by S. The first lines of stratification, which could be considered as of much value in determining the inclination of the beds, were observed on the eastern side of Great Bay des Noquets. Here, in the high bluffs, occur alternating bands of coarse and fine-grained materials, which are visible for long reaches. A particular stratum, which is here two hundred feet above the lake-level was identified near the surface, opposite the most westerly of the Summer islands, \u2014 a distance of six miles. This would give an incli nation of S. E. by S. of thirty-three and a half feet per mile. Another coarse-grained stratum, which occurs in these bluffs, was ob served to sink at the rate of thirty feet in the distance of one and a half miles on a meridian line ; another sank thirty-five feet, in 1J miles, on a course S. 20\u00b0 E. Passing among the Summer isles, the dip was everywhere observed to be to the S. E. and S. E. by E., at the rate of forty to forty five feet per mile. On the west side of the main island, it was greater, being one foot in one hundred, or fifty to sixty feet per mile ; but, crossing to the next island, one mile west, it was very slight. Although the local deviations are here numerous, yet the general direction is to the south east. Between this island and St. Martin's, there are three smaller ones, about two miles distant, on the northernmost of which there is little incli nation in the beds ; but, at St. Martin's, it is very perceptible and regular to the south-east, at an angle of forty to fifty feet in a mile. On Light-House island it is the same in direction, but irregular in amount. On Potawotomee island, in the high cliffs north-west of Wash ington harbor, there is a well-defined stratum of coarse-grained rock, which, at the point, is twelve feet above the water-level ; one-third of a mile south, it is eight feet, and one-third of a mile east, it is three feet. This gives a dip of about thirty feet to a mile, in a south-east direction. Thus, all the observations in the vicinity of Green Bay coincide in the direction of the line of greatest dip, and show no undulations in the strata ; a fact to be remembered when we consider the question of the total thick ness of these beds. We now proceed to the discussion of the more extended lines of dip, so far as they have been determined. Extended Lines of Dip. \u2014 The elevation of the upper surface of the Potsdam sandstone has been determined by Mr. Lapham, at Janesville, Wisconsin, (in township 3 N., range 12 E.,) to be one hundred and sixty feet above Lake Michigan ; and by myself, in 1849, while engaged in the survey of Wisconsin under Dr. Owen, near the Wolf river, (town ship 22 N., range 16 E.,) to be one hundred and ten feet above Lake Winnebago, which is stated, by Captain Cram, to be one hundred and"], [499, "181 [4] sixty, and by Mr. Alston, to be one hundred and sixty-five feet above Lake Michigan, making, say two hundred and seventy feet. The upper surface of this belt, where intersected by the Menomonee river, is between fifty and sixty feet above Lake Michigan. At the centre of township 39, range 28, of the Michigan meridian, I estimate its height at three hundred feet. At the Pictured Rocks, Lake Superior, it is at about the same eleva tion above the surface of that lake, which is supposed to be about forty-six feet above Lake Michigan. Where the St. Mary's river crosses this band, on Sugar island, the elevation is but a few feet above the surface. The bearing and distance of these several points have been determined by the public surveys. Line No. 1. From Janesville to Township 22 N., Range 16 E. \u2014 Wis consin meridian \u2014 course N. 11\u00b0 E. ; distance one hundred and twenty six miles ; rise one hundred and ten feet. 2. From Township 22, Range 16 E. \u2014 Wisconsin meridian \u2014 near Wolf river, to the Menomonee river in Township 34, Range 28 W. \u2014 Michigan meridian \u2014 course N. 27\u00b0 E. ; distance sixty-two miles ; descent two hun dred and twenty feet. 3. From the Menomonee river, west side of Township 34 N., Range 28 W. \u2014 Michigan meridian \u2014 to the centre of Township 39 N., Range 28 W.; course N. 6\u00b0 E. twenty-eight miles; rise estimated at three hundred feet. 4. From the crossing of the Menomonee to the Pictured Rocks; course N. 35\u00b0 E,. eighty-four miles ; rise estimated at three hundred feet. 5. From the first-mentioned point to the crossing of the St. Mary's river, at Sugar island, N. 68\u00b0 E. ; one hundred and ninety-two miles, descent estimated at forty feet. 6. From the Pictured Rocks to the last-mentioned point; east one hun dred and twenty-three miles ; descent estimated at two hundred and ninety feet. By combining any two of these lines so as to form a plane, it will repre sent the inclination of the surface of the sandstone (disregarding the spheric ity of the earth), and by a simple geometrical construction, the bearing and quantity of the dip, or line of greatest descent, are easily obtained. Lines Nos. 1 and 2, combined in this manner, give for the dip of the lower sandstone in Wisconsin, 14.3 feet per mile in the direction S. 76\u00b0 E. Nos. 2 and 3, at the crossing of the Menomonee give for dip thirty-nine feet pei mile, course S. 68\u00b0 E. Nos. 3 and 4, at the centre of Township 39 N., Range 28 W., 11.2, along a course S. 30\u00b0 E. Nos. 4 and 5, course S. 23\u00b0 E., give a dip of seven feet per mile. The disadvantage in rising lines like these, along the line of outcrop, is, that they do not make the best angles with each other ; but, in a level country, no others can be obtained. They do not in general represent the dip as great as it really is, or would appear to be, if they were protracted to the centre of the basin. Those above given are nearly coincident with the lines of bearing along the northern and western margin of the Silurian groups. The Hudson-river group, or that portion known as the Cincinnati blue limestone of the Ohio reports, is so marked in its external characters and zoological contents, that it is easily recognizable. By the -aid of Mr. Lapham, I have been able to obtain two lines along- its outcrop, whichmay be regarded as approximately correct."], [500, "182 [4] No. 1. From Stockbridge, Calumet county, Wisconsin, to the north line of township 26 N., range 23 E., on Green bay. Course N. 32\u00b0 E., fifty. eight miles ; descent two hundred and sixty feet. No. 2. From the first-mentioned point, S. 30\u00b0 W. 56 miles, to the north west corner of township 10 N., range 14 E.; rise twenty feet. This would give the line of dip S. 75\u00b0 E., at 13.8 feet per mile, which corresponds very well with the results before given. By my measurements and estimates in the bays and among the islands near the entrance to Green Bay, the dip of the superior members of the Silurian system was determined to be S. E. and S. E. by E., at the rate of thirty or forty feet to the mile. Mr. Lapham, who has carefully examined the various groups in the vicinity of Milwaukee, estimates their dip at from fifteen to seventeen feet per mile, due east. The best estimate which I have been able to make from observation between Fond du Lac of Lake Winnebago and Sheboygan gives about seventeen feet per mile in a direction S. 65\u00b0 E. Between the Manistee river and Point Detour, the inclination is S. E. by S., forty feet per mile; and in the vicinity of Mackinac, S. at the rate of thirty or forty feet. Thickness of the several Groups. \u2014 The Mackinac limestone, which is the equivalent, in part, of the Onondaga salt group \u2014 the superior member of the Silurian series \u2014 and the upper Helderberg limestone, is, by my measure ment, three hundred and fifty feet in thickness. Below this, is a thin, marly bed, containing gypsum, which probably does not exceed fifty feet. Classifying the beds without reference to organic remains, the next member, in the descending order, may attain a thickness of one hundred and fifty or two hundred feet, although its exact measurement is impracti cable. It is characterized by numerous corals, and hence may be desig nated as the coralline bed. Next succeeds the Pentamerus limestone, cropping out north of Macki nac, where it appears thinner than farther west ; but it is difficult to esti mate its thickness, so slightly is it exposed. It appears on the coast at Seul Choix and continues thence beyond Porte des Morts, having, at the entrance to Green Bay, a thickness of four hundred and eighty or five hundred feet. The groups from Mackinac to Seul Choix curve gradually to the south and pass into the lake. The upper portion of the Pentamerus bed is seen on Drummond's island and on the St. Mary's river \u2014 the dividing line between it and the coralline bed passing in a curvilinear form from Seul Choix to the northward of St. Martins' Bay, and thence to the St. Mary's river, a few miles above the Detour light. It is difficult to obtain the thickness of the subordinate groups, consisting of the Hudson-river, Trenton, Birds-eye and Chazy limestones, and the calciferous sandstone, superior to the Potsdam. If we knew their precise dip and area, the calculation would be comparatively easy. For the dip, we should take a medium between the upper and the lower groups, since the inclination of the superior strata is greater than the inferior ; but, in the interior, where the intermediate groups exist, their presence is almost en tirely concealed by drift, and they cannot, by direct observation, be sepa rated. They occupy a belt of country about forty miles in width, on the waters of Green Bay ; their easterly boundary passing from Sturgeon Bay through the middle of Great Bay des Noquets, while their westerly boun dary crosses the Wolf, Menomonee, Oconto and Escanaba rivers, on a line"], [501, "183 [4] nearly parallel with one through Green Bay, and about forty-five miles dis tant to the north-west. If the average dip of these intermediate beds be assumed at twenty-five feet per mile, on a line of forty miles across the basset edges of the strata, the rise would be one thousand feet ; but the surface of the country has also risen from three to four hundred feet, which should be deducted from the thickness of the mass, leaving it at six or seven hundred feet; and, allowing for irregularities in the strata, a further deduc tion of one hundred feet should also be made. Without attempting to separate the .several members between the Penta merus limestone and the Potsdam sandstone, I put their entire thickness at five hundred feet, as displayed on the waters of Green Bay, thinning out, however, as traced towards the St. Mary's. There is also a difficulty in estimating the thickness of the Potsdam sand stone, since its base is seldom visible. On the upper Menomonee, I saw one exposure of one hundred and fifty feet ; and I should estimate its entire thickness at two hundred feet. The results, then, of all my observations are as follows : 1. Potsdam sandstone, on the-Menomonee, 200 feet. 2. Calciferous sandstone, Birds-eye, Chazy, Trenton, Hudson- river and Clinton groups, as developed in the vicinity of GreenBay, 500 \" 3. Coralline and marly beds, near Mackinac, 200 to 250 \" 4. Mackinac limestone, 350 \" Making the aggregate thickness 1200 or 1400 feet.\" EVIDENCES OF DENUDATION AND SUBSIDENCE. In describing the detailed geology of this region, we have had occasion to speak of extensive tracts which were denuded at a remote geological epoch, of numerous examples of 'diagonal stratification, of ripple-marked surfaces, of clay cracks, of the trails of vertebrated animals, of shelving shores, of beach accumulations, and of stratified deposits of sand and clay, high above the present surface of the lake : \u2014 all of which indicate that the sea-bottom in which the various groups were deposited, was subject to re peated oscillations. As this is a subject of much geological interest, we deem it proper to re capitulate this evidence, in a connected form, even if we lay ourselves open to the charge of repetition. It has been shown that the surface of the ocean in which the Potsdam sandstone, or lowest member of the Silurian system, was deposited, did not reach within eight hundred feet of the culminating points of the granite and schists composing the azoic system ; that, all along the line of contact be tween the two series, there is a marked unconformability, the strata of the one being highly inclined, and of the other nearly horizontal ; that, in nu merous instances along this line., particularly at Middle island, Presqu'isle, Granite Point, Carp river, on the northern coast of Lake Huron and in the valley of the Menomonee, the harder and firmer rocks of the azoic series were denuded, their angularities worn down and their surfaces smoothed, before the deposition of the sandstone,\u2014 resembling, in this respect, the rdtks exposed, at this day, to the breaker action of the ocean. We have further shown that the detritus composing this sandstone was"], [502, "184 [4] arranged in layers, dipping slightly away from the prior-formed land, \u2014 an arrangement which is observed at this day in the accumulations around the islands of the sea, and along shelving shores ; that, at numerous points \u2014 for example \u2014 at L'Anse, Granite Point and Dead river, are found intermingled with the finer detritus, angular and slightly rounded fragments of the preexistng rocks, derived from the immediate vicinity, partaking, in this respect, of the character -of beach accumulations ; that the frequently recur ring instances of diagonal stratification, particularly observable in the series composing the Pictured Rocks, in the detrital accumulations at Granite Point, at Point Abbaye, and on the western coast of Keweenaw Bay, indi cate that the materials were not, in all instances, mechanically suspended, but were drifted along the bottom by tidal, or oceanic currents ; and that the frequent occurrence of ripple-marked surfaces, in the series, is strong if not conclusive proof of the subsidence of the sea-bottom. We have, also, as shown, in Part I. of our report, similar evidences of oscillation and of tidal deposits along the volcanic fissures in the copper region. These have been particularly observed on the northern flank of the Porcupine mountains, on the west coast of Kevfeenaw Point (at a locality known as the Hitz location), and'fcn the southern coast of Isle Royale. It frequently happens that we meet with slight alternations of arenaceous and aluminous particles, the one in the nature of a red sand and the other of a red mud, \u2014 such as are \"respectively deposited by an advanc ing and retreating tide. This mud, now consolidated into marl, is covered over with fissures, or cracks, such as result at this day from the drying of similar deposits along the margins of' rivers, or over low tracts adjoining the sea, indicating an exposure of the. ancient surface to atmospheric in fluences. Passing over several intermediate groups and ascending in the series of formations, we meet with evidences of a different character, but illustrating the same point, in the ripple-marked surfaces of the Clinton group, indented with the trails and tracks of animals. These layers were accumulated, if not upon ancient sea-margins, at least, upon the bottom of shoal and tran quil waters. We have seen, that, between the termination of the Onondaga salt group and the commencement of the upper Helderberg series, there occurs, in our district, an immense hiatus, during which, according to Mr. Hall, two dis tinct faunas lived and died, without having left a trace of their existence here; but we are uncertain whether the intervening deposits, which are clearly recognized in New York, thinned out before reaching this portion ot the oceanic bed, or whether they may not have once extended over it, though diminished in thickness, and been removed by an ancient denu dation. There are some facts which seem to warrant the latter conclusion, that is, of a denudation of the strata, not local, but extending over a wide area, which took place at about the close of the period of the Onondaga salt group. Thus, in New York, Mr. Hall states that the upper member ot this group exhibits an apparently water-worn surface, upon which the suc ceeding beds have been conformably deposited. Thus, too, near the upper portion of the cliff limestone, at Columbus,* Ohio, whose deposition must This interesting phenomenon was pointed out to us, in company with M Agassiz by Mr. Joseph Sullivant. Aster having pointed out the line through one quarry, he took us to another, a mile or more distant, where he showed us the same thing, thus leaving no doubt that it was not a mare local phenomenon."], [503, "185 [4] be referred to about this period, the ancient surface appears to have been planed down and smoothed in a most wonderful manner, differing altogether from the effects of breaker action. Were it not for the absence of stri\u00e6, it might be likened to the effects of drift agency. The fossils, principally Cyathophylla, are silicified, and, being harder than the matrix in which they are enclosed, project a few lines above the polished surface ; but show that they, too, were planed down by this agency, whatever it was. Upon this polished surface, the succeeding layers were conformably deposited, so that, in a vertical section, this line of demarcation appears no wider and no more distinct, than one of lamination, or stratification. We may further add that each division is characterized by a distinct fauna. Between the commencement of the Devonian and the dawn of the drift epoch, there is an immense gap in the series of formations in this district, and we search in vain for any evidences of the condition of the ancient sur face. In a former report, we have shown that stratified deposits of drift clay and sand occur in some cases at an altitude of nearly one thousand feet above the present level of the lake, and that, therefore, the waters in which these deposits were made, reached four hundred or five hundred feet higher than the surface of the ocean at the dawn of the Silurian epoch. We have, also, shown that the lake margin is lined in many places with stair-like ridges of loose materials, known as terraces, arranged one above the other, from which we infer that within comparatively recent geological times, the surface of the water has occupied different levels ; or, in other words, that the land has been subject to repeated elevations.* We have thus, then, abundant evidence of the oscillations of the surface, during the accumulation of the detrital deposits of this district, embracing a period of inconceivable duration, from the dawn of the Silurian epoch, when the Lingula and the Trilobite first appeared, to the close of the drift, when the gigantic pachyderms \u2014 the Mastodon and the Elephant \u2014 became extinct. These oscillations, with a few exceptions, to be adverted to here after, appear to have been attended with no corrugations, or displacements, of the strata, although they may have prescribed the limits of certain groups and modified their vertical range. They indicate nothing like catastrophes, nothing which would produce an instantaneous destruction of organic life ; and yet perhaps, they were less gradual than those elevations and depres sions which are now taking place in different parts of the earth's surface, the effects of which are rendered apparent by the lapse of centuries rather than of years. The coast of California exhibits fossil shells a hundred or more feet above the water,t identical with those which flourish along the shore : the same is true with regard to the St. Lawrence, Sweden, and other parts of the earth. The inference, therefore, is that in these instances, the rising of the land has been sufficiently gradual to enable the species to migrate and accommodate themselves to new conditions ; but these ancient oscilla tions appear to have been attended with far different results. In this connection, it may be proper to enquire into The Effects of these Oscillations on Organic Life. \u2014 To account for the repeated destruction of the varied forms of animal and vegetable life, which is attested by all geological researches, it is not necessary to suppose that these results have, in all instances, been brought about by violent perturbations, at variance with that calm operation of nature which we now see going on \u2022 Part I., pp. 188-194. t On the authority of Col. Jewett."], [504, "186 [4] around us. The sea, like the land, has its mountains and ralleys and its far-stretching plains, tenanted by a fauna more circumscribed in its range, and as susceptible to great changes as that which inhabits the land. An elevation of its bed to the height of a thousand feet, would convert many a chain of islands into mountain ranges, with intervening valleys, and many banks into plains, like the prairies of the West, the deserts of Africa, or the llanos of South America. It will at once appear obvious to the geologist that an elevation or depression of the bed of the ocean to such an extent, would be attended with a marked modification of both animal and vegeta ble life, over the entire area thus disturbed. New conditions would arise which would be fatal to their existence. These conditions have been ably discussed by De la Beche,* and consist of a change in temperature, pressure, light, and in the amount of air mingled with the water. In the depths of the ocean, according to the researches of Sir James Ross, and other navi gators, the water is supposed to possess a uniform temperature of 39.5\u00b0. At the poles this line approaches the surface, while at the _ equator it sinks far below it. By a subsidence of the land, many species in the equatorial regions, which are surrounded by a medium possessing a temperature of 78\u00b0, might be brought within the range of a temperature of 39.5\u00b0\u2014 a change which would be fatal to their existence. The investigations of Dana have shown that many of the corals, for instance the Astr\u0153acea, Madrepo racea, and Gemmiporidce range within latitude 28\u00b0 north and south of the equator, and that they are confined to a depth within one hundred and twenty feet of the surface. Darwin had before pointed out the depths at which other forms occur. The researches of Professor E. Forbes have shown that the eastern Mediterranean may be divided into eight zoological zones, each characte rized by a peculiar fauna. Similar results were contemporaneously arrived at by Professor Loven from his investigations of marine life along the coast of Norway. The same observations are true with regard to the marine flora, although it ceases far above the deepest regions of animal life. It would seem improbable that a coral which lives at an inconsiderable depth, in an equatorial sea, where the temperature rises to 78\u00b0, could continue to flourish, when transported near the poles, where the line of 39.5\u00b0 ap proaches the surface, or the colder water forms a stratum above it. As well might we expect to find an arctic vegetation, at the sea-level, beneath the tropics. But let us recur to the conditions of organic life on our own coasts. Ac cording to Dr. Gould,t of the one hundred and ninety-seven marine species found in Massachusetts, eighty-three do not pass to the south shore of Cape Cod, and fifty are not found on the north shore. The remaining sixty-four take a wider range, and are found on both sides. These results have been somewhat modified by subsequent investigations, but the great fact, as to their limited distribution, remains unimpaired. The same law, according to the same authority, is true with regard to Cape Hatteras \u2014 that 'cape forming a natural boundary between many of the forms of animal life inhabiting the sea, north and south. As marine life, then, like terrestrial vegetation, is adjusted to certain * Geological Observer, pages 162 to 190. We shall quote many of tho prominent foots adduced by him, which bear upon this point. t Report on the Inyertebrata of Massachusetts, pago 816"], [505, "187 [4] zones, the geologist, in investigating an anciently raised sea-bottom and the variously distributed organic remains, should be on his guard, lest he assign to different epochs animals which were really contemporaneous ; nor should he neglect to distinguish between littoral and deep sea deposits, which, al though simultaneously formed, would differ both in lithological characters and in organic remains. Without observing the gradations between the two extremes, he might rashly infer, from their relative level, that the one was imposed upon the other. Aside from the differences of temperature, we are, also, to consider the modifications arising from pressure. The law relating to this subject is well understood, and need not here be recapitulated. When we know the depth to which a certain animal penetrates, we can calculate the pressure which it is adapted to sustain. While some forms of marine life, like the nauti lus, have a wide, vertical range ; others, like the oyster, are extremely re stricted ; but to all there are fixed limits, beyond which they cannot pene trate. In investigating, therefore, the pal\u00e6ontology of past epochs, we ought, a priori, to expect to find certain forms ranging through a series of groups, while others would be restricted to a single one. \" We cannot suppose an animal so constructed,\" remarks De la Beche, \" as to sustain a pressure of more than two hundred atmospheres at one time, and two or three atmospheres at another. A creature inhabiting a depth of one hnndred feet would sustain a pressure, including that of the atmosphere, of about sixty pounds to the square inch, while one at four hundred feet, no very important depth, would have to support a pressure of 1,830 pounds to the square inch. \"Animals, among other conditions for their existence, are adapted to a given pressure, or certain ranges of pressure, so adjusted that they can move freely in the medium, either gaseous or aqueous, in which they live. All their delicate vessels and the power of their muscles are adjusted to it. When the pressure becomes either too little or too great, the creature perishes ; and, therefore, when acting freely in such a medium as the sea, an animal will not readily quit the depths in which it experiences ease. All are aware of the adjustment of an abundance of fish to the depths, to or from which they may frequently descend, by means of the apparatus of swimming-bladders. This arrangement, however, only changes their specific gravities as a whole, the relative volume occupied by the air, or gases in the swimming-bladders, being the chief cause of difference ; though, no doubt, also the squeezing process at great depths would diminish the volume of such other parts of their bodies as were in any manner compressible, the reverse happening with a rise from deep waters to near the surface. So adjusted to given depths do these swimming-bladders appear for each kind of fish, that it has been observed that the gas, or air, in the swimming-bladders of fish brought up from a depth of about 3300 feet (under a pressure of about one hundred atmospheres), increased so considerably in volume, as to force the swimming-bladder, stomach and other adjoining parts, outside of the throat, in a balloon-formed mass.\"* The modifications, therefore, of animal life resulting from pressure would be quite as great as those resulting from tem perature. Light, also, exercises a powerful influence upon marine, as well as ter- \u2022 Pouillet, Siemens da Physique Experimental. Geol. Obs. 164."], [506, "[4] 188 restrial life ; and we should expect that the fishes, crustaceans and molluscs, which possessed eyes, should occupy such levels as were adapted to their range of vision. Thus the Pomatomus telescopium, which, according to Professor Forbes, inhabits considerable depths in the Mediterranean, possesses remarkably large eyes, apparently constructed so as to concentrate all of the rays which penetrate to that level. The Trilobite of the ancient world, as demonstrated by Buckland, possesses a set of lenses similarly adapted to enable it to see at great depths. Professor E. Forbes has also adverted to the influence of light, upon marine animals, and shown that those inhabiting different zones are differently colored. Perhaps, however, the mere depri vation of light would not in all cases be attended with the extinction of marine animals, posnessing visual organs ; since the eyeless fishes of the Mammoth Cave, as shown by Wyman, have, in those respects, a rudimen tary organization. Marine animals, also, require for their existence a supply of oxygen, and at the junction of the sea and the atmosphere the absorption is the greatest. The observations of M. Biot render it probable that the con tents of the swimming bladders of fishes vary according to the depths at which they live. He found the contents to consist of pure nitrogen in those inhabiting shoal waters, while the contents of the bladders of those living at great depths consisted of oxygen and nitrogen, in the proportion of nine-tenths of the former to one-tenth of the latter. Again, as suggested by De la Beche, in tidal seas we find certain mol luscs, adjusted to live alternately exposed to the atmosphere and the sea. Some species are confined to the shores, while others are only found at great depths, and hence there can be no doubt that some require for their sus tenance a greater supply of oxygen than others. There are other effects resulting from the oscillations of the land, which might produce modifications in marine life. A greater amount of elevation in one part of the area than in another, might cause a change in the direc tion of the streams, and produce an influx of fresh water, which would be attended with the destruction of such testacea as were exclusively marine. In fact, this accords with the observations of Professor E. Forbes, in the \u00c6gean Sea, where certain species are wanting, which occur abundantly in the western Mediterranean. This result he attributes to the composition of the sea-water, rather than to climatic influences. Again, his observa tions have led him to believe that the distribution of marine life is effected by the nature of the sedimentary deposits distributed over the bottom. Thus, those animals whose habits adapt them to a muddy bottom, would not flourish upon a sandy one, and vice versa. Thus, too, the researches of Mr. Hall, in our own district, have shown that during the period of the deposition of the Niagara limestone, the character of the sediment was a variable. Under certain conditions, corals flourished in great abundance : change ensued, and they disappeared ; and this occurred not in one instance only, but was frequently repeated. Their extinction appears not to have been due to catastrophes, for we find no evidences of them, but to a change in the sediment. In the purely calcareous, or calcareo-magnesian beds, they appear to have flourished, forming reefs of considerable extent ; but where there was an influx of argillaceous mud, they died out altogether. A change in the relative level of the land might produce a change in the char acter of the detrital deposite and of the marine animals dwelling upon them"], [507, "189 [4] On the other hand, the submergence of the land would be attended with changes equally marked. The length of the streams would be shortened, and their power to transport detritus diminished, and the character even of that detritus might be modified. \"When the shores ceased to present them selves, the littoral marine animals, previously inhabiting them, and moving to the coasts as these retreated upon the descent of the main mass of land, would be expected also to have disappeared, unless able wholly or in part to have adjusted themselves to the new conditions. When, however, zone after zone of the marine vegetation disappeared as the circumstances fitted for its growth ceased, the animals which fed upon the plants would perish, and with them those which lived' upon the vegetable eaters, unless they could escape to other localities where food of the same kind, or of others which they could substitute for it, was to be found, and was sufficient for them.\"* In a region, for instance, like that under consideration, encircled in the main, with vast fresh-water lakes, as the sea invaded the land, the waters would first become brackish and then saline ; and thus we might have three distinct sets of formations, each characterized by a peculiar fauna. We thus see that the elevation or depression of extensive tracts of land at this day, would be attended with the extinction of many forms of animal and vegetable life ; and, reasoning from analogy, we have a right to infer that the mutations in the surface of the earth, in times past, which as the researches of geologists have shown were of frequent occurrence and of vast extent, were attended with similar results. * Geological Observer, p. 625."], [508, "[4] 190 CHAPTER XII.

In Part I. of this report, we have described, somewhat in detail, the ex tent, mode of occurrence and economic value of the metallic deposits, which occur in the lower portion of the pal\u00e6ozoic series. In regard to the value and extent of the mineral deposits of the copper region, we have no addi tional remarks to offer, except that the productiveness of the veins has fully equalled, if not exceeded, the estimate given by us in our report ; and that the prospects of companies engaged in mining, at various points along the cupriferous belt, are better, at this time, than at any period since the first exploration and settlement of that country. We shall now proceed to give some account of the rocks and minerals of the above-named series, especially of those occurring in other portions of the district, remote from the trappean ranges, with especial reference to their economic value ; and in order to arrive at a more accurate knowledge on this point, we shall give the results obtained by us in our chemical exa mination of some of the more important of these materials. Where these investigations seem to throw light on any points of scientific interest, we shall briefly discuss them in their theoretical bearing and general applica tion. SANDSTONES AND CONGLOMERATES. Chemical and Mineralogical Composition. \u2014 At a distance from all igne ous action, where the sandstone has been regularly deposited and not sub jected to any disturbing influences, it appears to be made up almost entirely of angular fragments of nearly pure quartz, which are hardly held together by any visible cement. The grains are generally of the size of a pin's head, and often present crystalline facets. The sandstone, on the southern slope. of the axis, is generally of this character, and its composition will be seen from the following analysis, which shows it to be almost pure silica, or quartz. The specimen analyzed was from the White Rapids of the Menomonee river ; it is white, granular, and very friable \u2014 so much so, that it is diffi eult to preserve a specimen, since it crumbles so easily when handled. It was futed with carbonate of soda, after ignition, in which process it"], [509, "[4] 191 lost two-tenths of a per cent, of water, and retained its original pure-white color perfectly. 1.3880 grammes gave 1.3835 of silica, which was perfectly soluble in carbonate of soda. The residuum consisted mostly of alumina, with only a trace of iron and lime. Silica - 99.67 Alumina, trace of iron and lime - .33 100.00 The Potsdam sandstone, at numerous other points, will probably be found of equal purity, though in general it is somewhat colored by a trace of iron. In the vicinity of the trappean rocks, it becomes highly charged with iron and calcareous matter, the latter being so generally and inti mately associated with ail of these sandstones, that they effervesce strongly with acid, even when no perceptible particles of lime can be seen. A specimen from the first bed at Copper Falls, of a deep brownish-red color, lost 2.7 per cent, on ignition at a low red heat; it effervesced strongly with acid, and 38.8 per cent of the pulverized substance was dissolved by diges tion with chlorohydric acid. The soluble portion contained a trace of copper, and a large amount of peroxide of iron, a little alumina and lime, and a trace of magnesia. The insoluble part consisted mainly of quart zose grains, of a light reddish-grey color. Economical Application of the Sandstones. \u2014 The above analysis of the sandstone shows conclusively that it would furnish an excellent material for making glass, as it possesses a remarkable degree of purity. There are many localities where an abundant supply of an equally pure material might be obtained, both near the shores of Lake Superior and Lake Michi gan. The grains of silicious substance, in the purer sandstones, not being held together by any calcareous, or ferruginous cement, the stone can be pulverized with the greatest facility. In fact, there is so little coherence between the particles, that it crumbles readily between the fingers, so that we have found it difficult to preserve specimens of these sandstones, except in the form of sand. The sandstones of the Silurian system, in our district, rarely furnish good building materials, except in the vicinity of the trappean belts. Here, they are cemented firmly by ferruginous matter, and appear to contain few impurities of a nature to cause them to crumble, and become discolored by the action of the weather. From the total absence of organic remains in them, they seem to be free from many substances which result from the decay of organic matter. Some of these sandstones are in beds of two or three feet in thickness, and are traversed by joints, which would afford essential aid to the quarry-man in getting out blocks of a convenient size for building. At other localities, for instance above the portage of Kee weenaw Point, the more thinly-bedded varieties would furnish tolerable stones for flagging. Some of these sandstones would undoubtedly be found to make excellent hearths for furnaces ; and could be used for other purpo ses, where a very refractory material is required. CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF VARIOUS LIMESTONES. Method of Analysis.\u2014 The analyses of the various limestones occurring within our district were made as follows :"], [510, "[4] 192 The pulverized substance, of which a quantity equal to from 1 to 1.5 grammes was taken for analysis, was carefully dried at a temperature a little above 100\u00b0 C. A portion was then introduced into a weighed appa ratus, in which the carbonic acid was set free by the action of chlorohydric acid, and dried in its escape by a tube containing chloride of calcium. The loss of weight was estimated as carbonic acid. The insoluble portion was filtered off, ignited and weighed ; and, when it was considered necessary, analyzed as a silicate, after fusion with carbonate of soda. In the filtrate, the iron and alumina were then precipitated by ammonia, together with a small portion of the magnesia and manganese, which were separated from each other in the usual way. The lime was precipitated in the ammoniacal solution by oxalic acid, and ignited and weighed as a carbonate. In the filtrate, if the soda was not to be determined, the magnesia was precipi tated by phosphate of soda, and weighed as phosphate of magnesia. It the soda was estimated, it was done by several of the processes described for separating it from magnesia. The method, however, which seems to furnish the most accurate results, and by which we are satisfied that these two substances can be separated most perfectly and with the least trouble, at least when the quantity of soda is small in comparison with that of the magnesia, is as follows : The filtrate, after separating the lime, is evaporated to dryness over the water-bath, and ignited in the platina capsule to expel the ammoniacal salts ; the remaining substance is then transferred to a thin, but tolerably large-sized, platina crucible, and strongly ignited for a con siderable time, the cover of the crucible remaining on. The ignition must be repeated till there is no longer any loss of weight ; and, at short intervals, the crucible must be allowed to cool and its contents must then be moistened with a drop or two of water, and a small fragment of carbonate of ammonia laid upon the bottom. In this way, all the chloride of magnesium will be decomposed, and pure magnesia be left behind, which, being almost entirely insoluble, can easily be separated from the chloride of sodium. If the ope ration is properly conducted, no trace of magnesia will be found in the solution containing the soda. The chlorine was estimated on a separate portion, by dissolving in pure nitric acid, and precipitating by a salt of silver. ANALYSES OF LOWER SILURIAN LIMESTONES.

Remarks on the above analyses of lower Silurian limestones; By Mr. Hall. The analyses of several specimens of these limestones show them to be highly magnesian. A single exception occurs in the limestone from the vicinity of Miners' river, in which only five per cent, of magnesia was found. In the other examples of limestone from the same geological posi tion, the per centage amount of magnesia is equal to two-thirds that of the lime in two of them, and more than equals the lime in the other example. The specimen from the Escanaba river, of which the analysis is given, was from the lower part of the calciferous sandstone and near its junction with the Potsdam sandstone ; this accounts for the large proportion of sili cious matter. The calciferous sandstone is everywhere magnesian, from the Hudson to the Mississippi river, the character of the rock changing mainly from the varying proportion of silicious matter which it contains at different points. Other specimens, taken from widely separated localities, show that the nferior members of the lower Silurian limestones are everywhere mag- nesian. A specimen of the calcareous shale of the Hudson-river group shows a proportion of 12.21 percent, of magnesia and 22.13 of lime, which, deduct ing the silicate of alumina 28.71 per cent., would form a dolomitic com pound. In its eastern extension, where the proportion of calcareous matter is far less, the shales are highly magnesian. This is still farther shown where the same strata, in a metamorphic condition, form the talcose slates of New York and the western part of New England. The occurrence of magnesia"], [513, "[4] 195 in tnese rocks in their unaltered and undisturbed position, over so wide an area, is a sufficient explanation of the character of the same rocks when metamorphosed, without supposing that the magnesian character was the result of this process. Since the age of these slates has been well de termined, the chemical examination of their unaltered equivalents becomes a matter of much interest, and chemistry can hardly render a greater ser vice to geology than by furnishing the results of accurate analyses of these metamorphosed rocks and of the same rocks where they have not under gone this change.

This is a compact, highly crystalline marble, and, from its position with regard to the deposits of iron, and the settlements in its vicinity, is of considerable importance. It is a highly magnesian limestone, containing almost forty per cent, of carbonate of magnesia. 2.0675 grammes gave .3005 insoluble silicious substance ; .007 peroxide of iron, = .0063 protoxide; .954 carbonate of lime; .1665 phosphate ot magnesia, and a trace of manganese. Silicious substance 14.53 Carbonate of iron and manganese-- .49 Carbonate of lime 46.14 Carbonate of magnesia 38.01 Water and trace of chlorine and sulphuric acid .83 100.00 All the saccharoidal marbles accompanying the rocks of the azoic series resemble each other in external characters, and, probably, have a chemical composition similar to that given above. They are, when polished, highly ornamental, being variegated with flesh and buff-colored bands and patches. General Remarks \u2014 Theory of Dolomitization. \u2014 From the above series of analyses, it will be seen that nearly all the Silurian limestones contain considerable magnesia. The limestone of the Pentamerus beds of the Niagara group is almost a pure dolomite. This is an interesting fact, as it shows the existence of heavy, stratified deposits of this sub- stance, in a position where there is no reason to suppose that any change \u00bb could have taken place in them, after their deposition, from the action of igneous causes, since they are far removed from any rocks of any other than a sedimentary character. They extend, with great similarity of external characters, through the whole of our district, from the St. Mary's to Green Bay, and are developed to a very great thickness. They are white, and highly crystalline, and abound in casts of the Pentamerus, the interior of the casts being generally lined with crystals of dolomite. There are only two theories which can be admitted with regard to the formation of these beds ; either, that they were deposited originally in their present form ; or, that they were originally deposited in the same manner, and with a similar composition to the beds above and below, and"], [516, "[ 4 ] 198 have since been metamorphosed and converted into dolomite, by hydro chemical agencies; in other words, the metamorphic action must have been of an aqueous, and not of an igneous, character. Although the pos sibility of the original deposition of dolomite from an aqueous solution has been denied, and is still, by some geologists, the large majority are dis posed to admit the Neptunian origin of dolomite strata, at least in some instances. Numerous are. the theories which have been put forth as furnishing a probable idea of the chemical action, by which the originally deposited car bonate of lime might have been converted into dolomite. That of Hai dinger, which has excited considerable attention, and which has been insisted on by Morlot, takes for its starting point the frequent occurrence together of gypsum and dolomite, and maintains that the change was brought about by the agency of a solution of sulphate of magnesia, at a great depth and under pressure. According to this theory, one atom of carbonate of magnesia was formed, by the mutual action of the solution of sulphate of magnesia and the carbonate of lime, which united with another atom of the latter, forming dolomite ; while the sulphate of lime, formed at the same time, was removed. This reaction, though exactly the reverse of what actually takes place, under common circumstances of pressure and temperature, has been supposed to be upheld by some experiments of Mor lot, at a high temperature and under a pressure of fifteen atmospheres, though the result was only partially favorable; for, although by the double action, sulphate of lime and carbonate of magnesia were formed, yet it remained uncertain whether any combination took place between the latter and the carbonate of lime, so as really to form dolomite. If this theory be the correct solution of the formation of dolomite, we should expect to find some traces remaining in these dolomitic beds of the sulphate of lime, which must have been formed at the same time with the dolomite. We were unable, however, to find any deposits of gypsum in the Pentamerus beds, and are disposed to regard this as a difficulty in the way of adopting this theory, which would require the formation and subse quent removal of such an enormous amount of sulphate of lime. If we consider the very large amount of magnesia present in some of the shales, which have evidently undergone no change since their deposition, since the fossils entombed in them remain in a perfect state, and do not exhibit any marks of metamorphic action, we must allow the possibility of the original formation, under circumstances not hostile to animal life, of a highly magnesian deposit. The shales of the Hudson-river group, which are filled to repletion with organic remains, in perfect preservation, contain, after subtracting the silicious and aluminous portion, almost a sufficient per centage of carbonate of magnesia to form a dolomite ; the same is true of the shaly beds of the Clinton group ; but these strata are highly impure, since they contain from thirty to forty per cent, of insoluble residuum, and are, of course, destitute of a crystalline structure. We may conceive that the production of these marly beds involved a two- fold action in their deposition. In the first place, a mechanical action was introducing into the great basin, in which the deposition was going on, a supply of finely-comminuted, argillaceous materials, or mud, which was gradually sinking to the bottom ; while, on the other hand, a chemical action was separating from the solution a mixture of the carbonates of lime and magnesia. If the quantity of the carbonates was in the proper"], [517, "[4] 199 relative proportion, a hue dolomite would be formed, if not a dolomitic limestone. In the process of formation of the Pentamerus beds of the Niagara group, the action was almost purely a chemical one, since the quantity of matter introduced by mechanical causes, is hardly more than a half of one per cent. Hence, we can easily conceive of the exertion of a force by which the whole mass was made to acquire a crystalline struc ture \u2014 an arrangement of the particles of the rock which may have been contemporaneous with its deposition, or posterior, and dependent on some change in the causes acting externally at the time. We see from the above analyses that all the Silurian limestones of our district contain a small amount of soda, chlorine, and sulphuric acid. The quantity of soda is generally sufficient to be weighed, amounting, some times, to one or two-tenths of a per cent. This soda is probably present mostly as a carbonate, since the quantity of chlorine is too small to take it all up, in forming chloride of sodium. The sulphuric acid may, probably, be combined with the magnesia. Distinct traces of these salts may be ob tained by digesting these limestones, after they have been pulverized, with pure, distilled water. In regard to the occurrence of these substances in the limestones and shales of our district, Mr. Hall's manuscript furnishes the following remarks : \" It is an important geological fact, that all of these limestones contain a small proportion of soda, chlorine, and sulphuric acid. The source of these substances was undoubtedly the water of the ocean, from which the rocky strata were originally thrown down ; and we are enabled to trace through out the strata of this long period, from the earliest Silurian, to the dawn of the Devonian series, the existence of these substances ; and, notwith standing the influence of the weather to which the edges of the strata have been exposed, an appreciable quantity yet remains undissolved. We are aware of the production of sulphate of magnesia, by the slow de composition of many of the shaly rocks, in situations sheltered from the weather ; and, also, in a few instances, of the production of carbonate of soda. Salt springs, or licks, occur abundantly in many geological groups, and their origin is, doubtless, to be sought in the decomposition of the rocky strata. In certain situations, or from other causes than the chemical com position of the deposited mass, a larger portion of the saline matter has been included in the rock, whose dissolution gives rise to salines, or brine springs, of great economical value. The earliest group in which, at this time, they are known to occur, is that known as the Medina sandstone, while in the Onondaga salt group, we have them in greater purity and far more copious, thus indicating a larger proportion of saline ingredients in the strata. In attempting to account for the presence of sulphuric acid in the strata, we may reasonably suppose that, in some instances, the decomposition of animal remains has given rise to the sulphur, while its existence in the waters of the ancient ocean, even before the advent of animal life, may, also, have been one of the sources from which it was derived.\" ECONOMICAL APPLICATION OF THE LIMESTONES. For Calcination into Lime.\u2014 That portion of the district which was especially the subject of Part I. of this report, is, for the most part, destitute of the materials for making quick-lime. The only locality which may be"], [518, "[ 4 ] 200 said to be at all near to the copper region, is that described by us in Part I., page 117. This limestone is highly magnesian, but quite free from sili cious matter, and would furnish good lime. It will, however, for a long time, at least, be more convenient to bring lime from the islands and vicinity of the St. Mary's river, where the limestones are directly on the waters' edge, than to construct a road of ten or twelve miles in length, to the de posit west of L'Anse. For want of a better material, the mining com panies on Keweenaw Point have occasionally resorted to the somewhat ex pensive method of mining the veins of calc-spar in the conglomerate, for the purpose of getting a material to calcine into lime. One or two instances have come to our knowledge, where they have even had recourse to J picking up the limestone pebbles on the lake-beaches, for this purpose. It is evident that, when once a canal has been built around the falls at the Saut, it will be much less expensive than it now is to procure lime from the kilns of the St. Mary's river. Throughout the whole of the district which borders on the St. Mary's river and Lakes Huron and Michigan, there is an abundance of limestone suitable for calcination. The Niagara limestone is that which is most com monly exposed on the lake-shore, and which has hitherto furnished the principal part of the lime used in that region. Kilns exist on Lime island, at the Detour, and at other places. The above analyses of the limestone of the Pentamerus beds of this group, show that they consist of an almost che mically pure dolomite, well adapted to burning into lime. The mag nesia is not detrimental to the mortar, but displaces a portion of the sand which would be required, were the material used a chemically pure carbo nate of lime. The coralline beds of this group, when not silicious \u2014 and this is the case with the upper part of the group \u2014 furnish lime of an ex cellent quality. Large quantities might be furnished, at numerous points, along the lake-shore. Hydraulic Cement. \u2014 Many of the lower, thin-bedded portions of the Clinton group are well adapted to making hydraulic cement ; and, whenever there shall exist a demand for this substance in this region, it may be pro cured here in unlimited quantity. Building Materials. \u2014 The value of the limestones of the Niagara group for the purposes of construction, has been tested throughout western New York and Canada West. The locks and other structures on the western part of the Erie and Welland canals, are good examples of the durability of this limestone, and its adaptation to such works. It has been determined by careful experiments, made in England, espe cially with a view to the selection of the material for the new houses of Parliament, that those limestones are most durable, and best in every respect, in which the lime and magnesia exist in the proportion required to form a proper dolomite. This is the case with a large part of the beds of the Niagara group in this district, and, hence, we should conclude that they would furnish a durable building stone. They also contain but a very minute portion of soluble salts, or of protoxide of iron, which are generally allowed to be detrimental to the durability and beauty of a material intended for architectural purposes. A large portion of the lower limestones, especially of the Trenton group, will also be found available for the same purposes. The limestone of this group, at the mouth of the Escanaba, may be instanced as a good locality for a durable building material."], [519, "201 [4] ORES AND OTHER SUBSTANCES OF ECONOMICAL VALUE. Traces of copper are not unfrequent in the sandstone, even at a distance from the trappean belts ; but there is no reason to suppose that there are any metallic veins of any value, either in the sandstones or limestones of the pal\u00e6ozoic series in our district. With regard to the occurrence of ores of lead and other metals, in the southern portion of the district, Mr. Whittlesey makes the following remarks : \" From the general belief which prevails among those residing on the shores of Green Bay, and the numerous rumors afloat respecting the ex istence of lead, copper and silver, an explorer in that quarter would be led to indulge in high hopes of success. Many of the supposed metals, on inquiry, are found to exist only in the stories of Indians, who are fond of telling marvellous things, and ever ready to feed the credulity of the whites. There are, however, well-au thenticated cases of the occurrence of lead, copper, and silver ; but these have, for the most part, been traced directly to the drift. As it is now settled that the force, whatever it was, which denuded the country and transported the blocks of rocks and the beds of sand and clay, acted from the north towards the south, it follows, that the ores which exist at the north would be found in the detritus at the south. Blocks of native cop per, according to Mr. Lapham, have been found in Wisconsin as far south as Milwaukee and Racine ; and, according to Mr. Bela Hubbard, as far south as the county of Berrien, in the state of Michigan. We saw almost every mile along the northern shore of Lake Michigan, fine illustrations of this transporting power, in the rolled pieces of magnetic and specular iron ore scattered along the beach, from Drummond's island to Green Bay. They varied in weight from a few grains to two or three hundred pounds. The Galena limestone in Wisconsin and Iowa is richly impregnated with lead. The reported occurrence of this metal in the sandstone of the Oconto and Peshetego rivers is undoubtedly true, as it occurs, under similar condi tions, farther west ; but not in such quantities as to give encouragement to mining enterprise. It exists, also, in some of the Silurian groups which form the coast of Lake Michigan, from Great Bay des Noquets to Seul Choix. The same rocks appear on the west shore of the lake, and on the east coast of Green Bay ; and, according to Mr. Lapham, in their south-westerly ex tension, connect in the valley of Rock river with the true lead-bearing rocks of Wisconsin and Iowa. East of Rock river, they have not as yet been found to contain any productive veins. They lack that frequency, openness and regularity of fissure which seem essential to valuable deposits. Fragments of lead may also have been distributed over portions of the north-west by means of the Indians ; for, it is well known that they were in the habit of resorting to the mines and procuring specimens for traffic, long before the whites took possession of the country. I have seen specimens a few inches in diameter, perfectly angular, three hundred miles from the parent source, which were thus distributed by the agency of the red man. Float mineral, or that dispersed by the drift, is invariably rolled and water worn. Its presence is to be regarded merely as an inducement to search, and not as conclusive evidence that the parent bed exists in the vicinity.\" Gypsum. \u2014 Below the limestone of Mackinac, as observed by Mr. Whit-"], [520, "[4] 202 tlesey, there is a marly bed about fifty feet in thickness which contains gypsum. It is generally of a brown cast, with spots of white ; and, no doubt, exists in large quantities. The northern out-crop of this bed is not very broad, and would be represented on the map by a curved line from St. Martin's island, extending back from St. Ignace and Gros Cap and inter secting the lake at Pointe aux Chenes. It does not everywhere contain gypsum, but incloses this mineral in the form of nests, or irregular patches. It has been quarried at Pointe aux Chenes. In the shoal water around St. Martin's island, when the lake is low and tranquil, it may be picked up in blocks of fifty or sixty pounds weight. Much of it is impure, being more cr less mixed with carbonate of lime. If a search were to be made for workable beds, the best mode would be to find the marly stratum, where it emerges from the lower surface of the brecciated limestone, and there bore through it, examining the borings with care for gypsum. As this substance may not be readily recognized in a pulverized state, by the ordinary observer, we give the most obvious tests: On the application of sulphuric, or nitric acid, no effervescence takes place; whereas, with carbonate of lime, it does. When exposed on red-hot coals, it decrepitates, becomes white and splits into brittle plates. At a tempera ture of about 400\u00b0 F., the water of combination escapes, attended with ebullition. The presence of ten or twelve per cent, of carbonate of lime improves its quality. Used as a mortar, it becomes more adhesive, and stucco work, executed in this manner becomes firmer and more durable. Geologically, the position of this gypsum corresponds with that of San dusky Bay, Ohio, and that of Grand river, Canada,"], [521, "[4] 203 CHAPTER XIII. DESCRIPTION OF NEW, OR RARE SPECIES OF FOSSILS, FROM THE PAL\u00c6OZOIC SERIES. BY JAMES HALL. Marine Fossils from the Potsdam and Calciferous Sandstone. \u2014 From the Chazy, Birds-eye, and Black-river Limestones, and the Hudson-river Group. \u2014 From the Clinton Group. \u2014 From the Niagara Group. \u2014 From the Upper Helderberg Series. \u2014 List of Organic Remains. \u2014 General Remarks. POTSDAM AND CALCIFEROUS SANDSTONES. This sandstone on Lake Superior, so far as we have been able to observe, is generally destitute of fossils. It is true, the incoherent character of much of this rock, along the southern shore, would, in some degree, pre vent the recognition of the small shells of the Lingula, which is the pre vailing fossil of the same formation in other regions. In 1845, Mr. Forrest Shepherd brought from Tequamenon Bay, two speci mens of sandstone containing Lingul\u00e6. The rock was composed of rounded grains of quartz, cemented by calcareous matter, having the appearance of oolite, and corresponding, in general appearance, with the upper part of the Potsdam, in other localities. In a small fragment were parts of five sepa rate valves of Lingula, two of them nearly entire. The form of the entire shell is round-obovate, and more elongated in proportion to its breadth than the ordinary specimens of L. prima from the same sandstone in New York. Nevertheless, I am not prepared to describe it as a distinct species. A careful comparison of specimens shows that the shell is very variable in the proportions of length and breadth. A comparison of these specimens from Tequamenon Bay, with the round forms from the St. Croix, shows such a close similarity, that I have little hesitation in regarding it as the same species. A careful measurement of a number of forms shows that the proportion between length and breadth is very varying; in some cases the length is equal to the breadth; in others one-fourth to one-third greater. Externally, the shell shows distinct, con centric stri\u00e6, and, sometimes, faint, longitudinal stri\u00e6 ; the latter becoming more distinct in the cast, or where the external shell has exfoliated ; and, in some instances, they are very prominent. This is decidedly a variable character, both as shown on the casts, and upon the interior of the shell ; the former often appearing quite smooth, perhaps from accidental causes. Specimens from the Escanaba river, in the lower part of the calciferous sandstone, resemble, in all of their important characters, those from Tequamenon Bay. From the comparison of specimens, I am inclined to unite all these in one species, which, in its wide distribution, and in more or less favorable situations, has undergone considerable changes ; but showing its most perfect development in the calcareous beds on the St. Croix river, which are crowded with the valves of this species, and another so closely resembling the L. antiqua, that I have not found characters to warrant the separation."], [522, "[4] 204 From the number of individuals occurring in the small fragment, from Tequamenon Bay, it is evident that, at that point, the rock was highly charged with these forms of organic life. These were not generally distri buted, but restricted to particular layers of greater or less vertical range. In the almost purely quartzose beds, as for instance, in New York, it is difficult to ascertain their true form, or proportions ; but, as the beds become more calcareous, the shells acquire greater dimensions, and are far better preserved, both in their outlines and their external markings. Lingula prima. Plate XXIII., figure 1, a, b, c, d, e,f, g. Lingula prima Conrad, Pal\u00e6ont. N. Y. Vol. I. p. 3, Plate I., figure 2. Shell round, or roundish, obovate; beak obtuse; umbo elevated; base rounded, or sub-truncate ; surface marked by close concentric stri\u00e6, and, at wider intervals, with more prominent lines of growth ; longitudinal stri\u00e6 more or less distinct, often scarcely visible on the exterior of the shell ; muscular impression. The form of the shell is often altered by the sides being more or less rounded, and sometimes nearly straight, from the broad base to the obtuse beak. In many instances in the New York specimens, the longitudinal stri\u00e6 are more prominent than the concentric ones ; but, in a larger number of specimens, procured since my description of the New York specimens was written, I find this character extremely variable, and, in some of them, scarcely visible. Some of the illustrations in Plate XXIII. are drawn from specimens col lected by myself on the St. Croix river. These, together with those pre viously given, will enable the collector to form a correct opinion of the characters of this widely-distributed species in the oldest fossiliferous rock.

The specimens from the Potsdam sandstone in the North-west, when compared with those from New York, prove so similar to this species, that I can only regard it as the same, but developed under more favorable cir-"], [523, "Plate XXIII POTSDAM SANDSTONE Arkerman Li*31? Broadway NY"], [524, ""], [525, "205 [4] cumstances. The great number of well-preserved specimens enables us to indicate its character and form, more fully than the imperfect specimens described in the New York Pal\u00e6ontology. The absence of longitudinal stri\u00e6, in the specimens described, is owing to the imperfection of the speci mens ; but there are other specimens from New York which exhibit this character in as marked a degree as those from the North-west. In many of the latter, the width, at the base, is proportionally greater than in those of New York, and, in the same individuals, the beak is proportionally more extended. We have, thus far, comparatively few specimens from New York, and, until we possess more extensive collections, the proper com parisons for determining the question can scarcely be made. Fig. 2. a, b, c, Different individuals, showing a variety of forms. In connection with the Lingul\u00e6 on the Escanaba river, I collected a number of obscurely pointed, triangular bodies, like those described in the Pal\u00e6ontology of New York as Thec\u00e6 ? They are, however, too indefinite to be described with any advantage at the present time. TRILOBITES OF THE POTSDAM SANDSTONE. In the Lake Superior district, the only fossils seen in the Potsdam sand stone, in addition to those just described, are the fragments of one or more species of Trilobites, which were found on the Menomonee river. These have the characters of the Ogygia, or Brontes ; but those in the possession of the survey, are too imperfect to admit of a satisfactory determination. A farther examination of the prolongation of this sandstone across the in terval between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi and St. Croix rivers, has resulted in satisfying us that the sandstones of the two termini are identical in age, and the Trilobites specifically the same. These facts increase the interest of these specimens, and suggest the hope that we may yet find Crustaceans in more eastern localities.* With the above suggestions, as to the relations of the genus figured, I adopt the name proposed by Dr. Owen, presuming that the specimens col lected by him warrant the establishment of a new genus. Dikellacephalus, D. D. Owen. Plate XXIIL, fig. 3, a, b, c, d, e, and fig. 4. The fragments in our possession do not admit of a complete description * I have recently received from Professor Adams, of Amherst, specimens of partially metamorphosed sandstone from Salisbury, Vt., which he regards as the equivalent of the Potsdam. The specimens have all of the characters of the purely quartzose variety of this rock, and contain fragments of crinoidal columns, and casts of an acephalous bivalve, simi lar to Modiolopsis. Such facts are highly interesting, and promise important results for the future. Since, however, no known fossils of the Potsdam sandstone occur with those just mentioned, it re quires a careful scrutiny to determine the age of the rock in situ."], [526, "[4] 206 of this fossil. The cheeks are projected posteriorly into long spines. In one fraoment, a line, which may have been the facial suture, reaches to the margin just within the angle. 'The spines are long, gradually curving and becoming round towards the extremity. The surface is marked by strong elevated stri\u00e6 ; caudal shield semicircular, the axis prominent and obtusely conical, extending about two-thirds the length, marked by five distinct rings : in the cast, there may have been six or seven in the outer-crust ; lateral lobe, with seven ridges, four of which may be called bifurcations of the second and third, which are simple in their origin ; margin flat, or depressed just within the margin. The margin is broken off, and its original extent not precisely defined :fc some faint remains of stri\u00e6 are preserved ; but, from the friable nature of the rock, it is impossible to determine the character. It is very apparent that there is a degree of similarity between the tail of this species and the Ogygia Portlockii ; but the difference is quite spe cific, anel the cheek-shields present few points of resemblance. The glabella figured on the same plate, fig. 4, is from the Mississippi ; and though the identity cannot be positively determined from this fragment, yet the fragments of cheek-shields found with it are undistinguishable from our specimens. From an examination of these and other similar fragments, I have been inclined to refer the species to Ogygia. Fig. 3. a, b, c, Fragments of the cheek and the prolonged spine.

Fossils from the Chazy, Birds-eye, Black River, and Trenton Limestones and Hudson-river Group. The following are among the undescribed and little-known species, col lected from these groups ; but principally from the two latter. Phenopora multipora. Plate XXIV., figure 1, a, b. Frond broad, irregularly ramose ; branches not numerous, broad, flat and thin ; surface marked by numerous parallel or slightly diverging rows of minute, roundish oval pores ; each row of pores separated by a distinct, elevated line, in a direction parallel to the axis of the strip\u00a9 or branch, and diverging at the bifurcation. Pores, fifteen in the eighth of an inch trans versely, and eleven or twelve in the same space longitudinally. Width of stripe, one-half to three-fourths of an inch.

Clathropora flabellata. nov. sp. Plate XXIV., figure 2, a, b. Clathropora, Pal\u00e6ont. of N. Y., vol. II., p. 159. Frond expanded, flabellate, somewhat plicate towards the base ; perfo rated by numerous roundish, or oval openings of variable size ;. cells minute, rhomboid-oval, arranged between obliquely ascending lines or lamin\u00e6 ; axis concentrically striated and corrugated around the perforations. This species bears a very near resemblance to C. frondosa of the Niagara group. In that one, however, the frond appears to be thicker, and the perforations smaller and more irregular. The cells in the present species are more oval, or elongated than in the Niagara species. The similarity of the two, however, is very striking, and requires a carefhl examination to distinguish between them.

Y., Vol. I. p. 64, plate 23, figures 1, 2, 3. I have heretofore described this species as occurring in hemispheric an ramose forms ; the former, in many instances, graduating into the latter by the projection of branches from a solid, or spheroidal mass. It is possible that there are other minute branching corals often confounded with this species, since it requires a careful examination to distinguish them. All of the New York species, whether hemispherical or ramose, are smooth ; but at the West and North-west, both forms become nodose, or have the surface covered with little stellate elevations. One of these has been described as"], [532, "[4] 208 a distinct species, and it may prove that there are several, since there is a considerable variety of surface presented. Under an ordinary magnifier, however, the cells all appear alike, and I have not yet been able to distin guish the different species by this means. On the Escanaba riv'er, where I observed a greater number of these corals than at any other locality in ths district, a large majority of the spe cimens, both hemispheric and ramose, have a nodose or stellate surface. This character is so remarkable as to deserve notice, since it appears to be peculiar to western localities. Fig. 1. a, A small, hemispheric specimen of the natural size. Fig. 1. b, A portion of the surface enlarged, showing some of the elevations to be solid, or pierced only by the cells, while others consist of elevated borders around a large cell.

Vol. I. p. 81, Plate 26. The columns of this species are very abundant on the Escanaba river, and attain a much larger size than those of the same rock in New York, and other eastern localities. The great number and large size of these fragments indicate a more favorable condition for the growth of these ani mals than at any other locality I have examined. Slabs of several feet in extent are often thickly covered with fragments, as represented in Fig. 2, a. Some of the fragments measured half an inch in diameter. Many of them, either from age, or from having been worn down, do not preserve the nodes upon the joints, but, in well-preserved specimens of medium size, they are always conspicuous.

Plate XXV., figure 4, a, b, c, This body consists of a ring, or a sac, the upper edge of which only appears, composed of numerous plates joining by their broader edges. The upper, or exposed surface of the plates is sculptured, or granulated, convex, and not closely joined together at the upper angles, presenting the appear ance of somewhat quadrangular tubercles ; exterior margin of each plate furnished with a thin, wing-like expansion, marked by two diverging ridges. This curious body is evidently crinoidean, from the character and struc ture of the plates. The ring presents an appearance very similar to the row of plates surrounding the valves which close the ovarian aperture in some Cystideans, but the number is far too great, being, in one specimen, twenty-nine, and apparently not less in the other. The inner faces of the plates, moreover, do not present any appearance, as if for the attachment of other plates, or valves. It is possible that it may be the elevated, mar ginal ring of some one of the sessile crinoids, though the arrangement of the plates is more regular than in any species known to me.

I have but a single tolerably perfect specimen, all the others being frag ments. In the larger and nearly entire one, the upper part of the head has been removed, showing the lower plate with the hypostome attached and in its proper place, though the whole head appears to have slipped downwards so as partly to cover the first articulation. The impression of the posterior spine is shown extending backward as far as opposite the fourth articulation of the axis of the tail. The crust is, in a great degree, removed, and on what remains, the imbricating stri\u00e6 are coarse and strong. In other speci mens of smaller size, these stri\u00e6 present the beautiful appearance described. The rings of the axis of the tail are obsoletely nodose, there still remaining the appearance of a double row of flattened nodes down the axis. The number of furrows in the axis of the tail appears to be as many in the"], [537, "TRENTON LIMESTONE.

In young specimens the tail is very convex, but in all of the larger ones it is flattened. This difference, however, appears to be due to the character of the rock in which the latter are imbedded, while the small specimens, in the limestone, preserve their natural forms. This species has considerable resemblance to A. tyrannus of Murchison, the most prominent differences being in the prolonged spines of the buckler, and the shorter and proportionally broader tail in one species. The pleur\u00e6, also, arch downwards towards the extremities more than in the figures of A. tyrannus.

Geological Position. \u2014 I first noticed this species in the limestone of the age of the Birds-eye, on the St. Mary's river. Subsequently, I saw it in the same position near Plattsville, Wisconsin, at a locality shown me by the Rev. John S. Lewis. At the latter place it occurs in a limestone which holds the place of the Birds-eye, possessing many of its characters, as well as some of its peculiar fossils. It also occurs in some shaly or flaggy. layers, associated with the thin stratum of limestone, and in them the finest specimens have been found. It is from a layer of this kind that the large specimen figured was obtained, by Mr. Pickard, of Plattsville. The litho logical character of this layer is almost precisely the same as some speci mens-of Llandeilo flags, containing Ogygia Buchii. Harpes escanabi\u00e6. nov. sp. Plate XXVII., figure 2, a. A single marginal plate, or shield, of the head of this fossil, is all that has fallen under my observation. The lower portion is exposed for about an inch on one side, and more than half as much on the other. It gradu ally diminishes in width from the front backwards, and is marked by rows of pores, the outer and inner^of which are larger than the inter mediate ones. The marginal rows of pores are regular and parallel to the margin ; of the intermediate ones, there are three or four in front and one at the most posterior portion visible. This portion of the fossil bears some resemblance to H. Doranni, of Port lock, but is, nevertheless, a distinct species.

It is here associated with Ch\u00e6tetes lycoper don, Lept\u0153na alternata, Orthis testudinaria, Phacops callicephalus, Cerau rus pleurexanthemus, and many other fossils of this group. It is the first example, to my knowledge, of the occurrence of a species of this genus in the lower Silurian strata, and a genus hitherto unknown in this country, unless, as I suspect, the fossil figured and described by me as Ceraurus ? pustulosus (Pal\u00e6ont., N. Y., Vol. I., page 246) prove to be a species of Harpes, the crust being removed, which gives the pustulose appearance. Should it prove to belong to this genus, it is still quite a distinct species from the one now described. Phacops callicephalus. Plate XXVIL, figure 3, a. b. Phacops callicephalus, Pal\u00e6ont., N. Y., Vol. I., p. 247. This species occurs in considerable numbers in the Trenton limestone upon the Escanaba river. I have seen only the separated heads and tails, but these are in greater numbers, at this one locality, than all I have seen in the state of New York. Fig. 3. a, The head of this Trilobite. Fig. 3. 5, The eye enlarged. The individuals observed at this locality are smaller than those in the same limestone in New York. The same is true of the Ceraurus pleurex anthemus, which also occurs here. It is probable that the admixture of arenaceous matter, while it does not appear to have interfered with the production of species, has diminished their size. This fact is true of the Crustacea and Mollusca, while the crinoidal columns are of a larger size than at any other locality observed. Catenipora gracilis. nov. sp. Plate XXIX., figure 1, a. b.

Coral cespitose, composed of irregular, cylindrical stems, which are con nected at intervals by lateral processes ; internally rayed and with trans verse septa ; externally striated The internal structure is obscure, since both the rays and septa have been removed and the interior is empty, or partially filled with crystalline matter. This species occurs in immense numbers, forming, in some places, almost continuous beds. Geological Position. \u2014 This species occurs in the shales in the upper part of the Hudson-river group, associated with Catenipora gracilis. It forms continuous layers on the eastern shore of Green Bay, above the entrance to Sturgeon Bay ; also, on the west side of Big Bay des Noquets, where it has once formed a continuous stratum, in the same position. This coral is of a type not observed by me in the lower Silurian series of New York, or elsewhere. Being associated with the Catenipora, a genus heretofore known only in the upper Silurian series, the beds containing these fossils become of ex-^ ceeding interest both to the geologist and the pal\u00e6ontologist, for it will be in such beds, if any, that he will trace a continuation, or passage, of orga nic beings from the lower to the upper divisions of the Silurian system.

Plate XXX., figure 1, a, b. c, and Plate XXXI., figure 1. Shell oval-obovate, elongate ; base slightly arcuate in she middle ; convex in the middle and compressed towards the posterior extremity ; umbones prominent, hinge-line slightly arched, and, in some specimens, nearly straight ; muscular impression, large and strong, near the anterior extremity ; surface marked by strong folds or ribs, which, originating on the hinge-line, diverge and curve gradually downward to the base. All the specimens of this peculiar species, which I have examined, are more or less distorted, so that we may not be fully acquainted with the form. The peculiar surface-marking, however, is unmistakable, and in nearly all the specimens is preserved, in some degree, in the casts. There appears to be considerable difference in the size of these ribs in different"], [550, "214 [4] specimens, and it is possible that we have among them two species, which, for the present, however, we prefer to regard as one. The form in many specimens is similar to that of M. modiolaris, but in the surface-markings, it is very distinct. In some specimens, however, from the same locality, which appear to belong to the M. modiolaris, I have observed concentric ribs similar to those in the species now described. In that species, however, they appear more arched, and confined to the region of the hinge-line, gradually losing themselves in the concentric stri\u00e6, and are quite obsolete towards the base. Nevertheless, we have never observed this feature in the New York specimens, and these western ones, thus marked, prove a distinct species. Fig. 1. a, The left valve of a large individual.

Geological Position and Locality. \u2014 This species occurs in the marly beds, constituting the higher portions of the Hudson-river group, on the eastern shore of Little Bay des Noquets. It is associated with M. modio laris and Ambonychia radiata, with two or three species of Orthocera tites. Modiolopsis modiolaris Plate XXXI., figure 2. a, b, c, d. Modiolopsis modiolaris, Pal\u00e6ont. N. Y., Vol. I., p. 294. The specimens figured present the sapie variety of form as those described in the Pal\u00e6ontology of New York. In several of them, how ever, the concentric stri\u00e6 become strongly marked along the back of the shell, forming, as in the preceding species, ridges, or cost\u00e6. The distinc tion between this and the preceding species is readily detected in tracing the cost\u00e6 from the hinge-line towards the base, the one continuing distinct, and terminating along the lower margin, while, in the other, they become merged in, and take the direction of, the concentric lines of growth. It would be desirable to compare a large number of specimens from different localities, in order to arrive at an explanation of these variations of character in what appear to be identical species. The specimens in my collection from Cincinnati and Madison, la., as well as those from New York and Canada, show scarcely any evidence of this character; and, it is not a little interesting to observe, that a locality, rffording another species so strongly marked, should also afford one simulating the same cha racters.

CLINTON GROUP. TRACKS AND TRAILS OF VERTEBRATES ? As already remarked, few characteristic fossils of this period were recog- nized in this district. The argillaceous limestones, which, for the most part, represent this group, contain few fossils. The argillaceous sandstones, which, in New York, represent the lower portions of the series, were ob- served at only one place, on the eastern shore of Green Bay, particularly I described in one of the preceding chapters. The surface of the slabs of this sandstone is covered with numerous tracks and trails, made at the time of their deposition, some of which differ so widely from those hitherto observed, as to require a detailed description. One of these, which is very remarkable, not only on account of its size, but for other peculiarities, is represented in plate XXXII. This track, or trail, occurs on the surface of a shaly sandstone, thinly laminated, indica- ting that the lamin\u00e6 were due to successive depositions. The materials were highly comminuted, and deposited in comparatively shoal and tranquil water, since the marks of the rippling waves are impressed upon the slab. The markings consist of a continuous depression, or groove, placed midway between a series of imprints, made in succession and at regular intervals, having a uniform character, as if made by the same organs. These- imprints ! consist at first, as seen on the left hand side of the slab, of a single series on each side of the trough-like depression, each one presenting a duplicate. Almost from the starting point, however, there are faint impressions of a second series, without and a little in the rear of the inner series. These, farther on, are observed to be of the same form, but less distinctly dupli- cate and less deeply impressed. For a part of the distance, these outer impressions are quite distinct on one side, but for the remainder, they are \u25a0 visible beneath the superimposed lamin\u00e6 of sandstone. On the other, or right; side of the trough, the outer series is very indistinct, appearing at only one or two points, being entirely obscured by the deposition of mineral matter. The imprints cut the stone rather abruptly on the anterior side, while on the posterior side, it is less so, and behind each one the stone is elevated in a little ridge, or node."], [554, "[4] 216 In some parts, the markings present the appearance of three or four toe like impressions, less deep than where the duplicate character is only per ceptible. There is nothing to indicate the attachment of long claws, or fimbriated appendages. The median groove is more shallow in some parts than in others, and, in this respect, the foot-like imprints correspond in faintness and distinctness. The distance from the centre of the median groove to the outer margin of the second series is uniformly two inches, making the whole width four inches. The distance of the imprints from each other, in the line of pro gression, is one inch and three-sixteenths, there being only one or two slight deviations, in twenty-four of these steps. The slab, from which the figure is taken, is three feet long ; at the left side, which is not represented in the figure, the imprints commence at the edge, \u2014 the continuation in that direction being broken off \u2014 where both the median groove and the foot-prints are slightly impressed, though still quite distinct. As they advance to the right, they become more distinct, but, before reaching the other extremity of the slab, they are concealed by layers of sandstone which cannot be removed. The course of the median groove is still perceptible from the depression of the lamin\u00e6 above it, and there are even slight depressions corresponding to the foot-prints, neither of which is represented in the figure. On this part of the stone, covering the track, there are numerous trails and imprints, apparently produced by or ganic bodies, but which are too obscure to admit of any satisfactory deter mination. It is very evident from an inspection of these impressions, that they have been made by some animal in voluntary motion ; and it would appear as if in the direction from left to right, for the reason already given. When, however, we would offer an opinion, as to the nature of an animal producing such a track upon the surface of an oceanic, or estuary beach, it becomes a subject of no little difficulty. From all the previous facts in our possession as to the character of the fauna which existed at this period, our preconceived notions are strongly opposed to the admission of the exist ence, at this period, of quadrupedal animals, contemporaneous with corals, crinoids, mollusks, and crustaceans, and the rare occurrence of fishes, as indicated in a few and ill-preserved fragments of ichthyodorulites. We have already been made aware of the trails of mollusks, during this epoch, which have been preserved on the surface of the rocky strata ; and there are others which may have been made by planarian worms, the bodies of which may not have been preserved. I have also described other tracks like imprints, possessing toe-like impressions, which possibly may have been made by fishes. The impression under consideration, however, has a cha racter differing widely from all the former, and only, in some degree, allied to the latter. If we were, for a moment, to regard this track as having been produced by an articulated animal, with an elongated body, and possessing lateral appendages, capable of making a double series of lateral imprints, we must first compare them with those made by similar animals, before we can become satisfied that such was their origin. In all of the trails I have seen, which could be referred to mollusks, or to planarian worms, whether made by existing worms, or by those which have left their impres sions on the rocky strata, there is positive evidence of the body having been pushed forward through the superficial sand, or mud, since there is"], [555, "[4] 217 raised up, on each side of the groove, a ridge continuous with the groove itself. In instances where these evidences of lateral appendages are observed, they have marked, at close intervals, the adjoining surface. In the present instance, the shallow groove is not lined with a ridge, as in those just mentioned, but appears to have been produced by a body drawn over the surface, while the anterior extremity was elevated above that level, and, consequently, none of the mud, or sand, has been pushed out. of the track to accommodate the animal. The lateral appendages, there fore, of whatever nature they may have been, may be presumed to have elevated the anterior portion of the body above the surface. These appendages, also, were of sufficient strength and power to bear the weight of the body upon their extremities, as shown from the impressions being firm, decided, and shows their depth that they were supporting a body of considerable weight, while the interval between the extremities and the junction with the body is clearly raised above the surface, and produces no imprint. Such, then, are some of the facts which ought to be regarded in forming an opinion of the animal by which these tracks were made. Whatever may have been our preconceived opinions, we find none of the characters, pertaining to this track, resembling those of known articulated animals ; and, if we would suppose that there may be large articulated animals capable of producing such impressions, it appears to me that we have, moreover, to suppose them provided with few \u2014 no more than four \u2014 lateral appendages for locomotion, and that they were, by these, capable of raising their bodies partially above the surface, and of moving by steps, instead of the gradually advancing motion characteristic of those animals of this class with which we are acquainted. I have made these observations for the purpose of presenting the facts in as clear a light as possible, and would cheerfully adopt an explanation which would satisfactorily refer these peculiar markings to an articulated body with the usual appendages. It now becomes important to find out the nature of the animals capable of making such tracks as these and others, which flourished during this period. In doubting that they were made by articulated animals, I have been wholly uninfluenced by the opinion of Professor Richard Owen, with regard to the nature of the tracks found in the Potsdam sandstone of Canada If we admit the existence of quadrupedal (chelonian) animals, during the period of the Potsdam sandstone, we should find less difficulty in supposing that they flourished during the deposition of the Clinton group. It must be remembered, however, that every step in the progress of geology has shown the occurrence of the remains of higher orders of animals in deposits of an earlier date than we had a right to infer that they existed ; and, although discoveries of this kind were, on their first announcement, received with in credulity, yet ultimately geologists were compelled to yield to the force of the evidence. It is not long since it was supposed that the mammalia did not extend below the tertiary ; subsequently, they were found in the lias, and now, it wOuld appear, they extend as low as the keuper. The tracks in the sandstone of the Connecticut valley are now admitted to have been made by birds ; but for a long time the evidence was regarded with distrust. The remains of air-breathing animals have mow been found as low as the coal, and the tracks of supposed reptilians below all the coal-"], [556, "[4] 218 seams.* The ripple-marks and mud-cracks even so low as the Potsdam sandstone and the evidence of beaches in a higher position prepare us to admit that there may have been conditions possible, at least, for the exist ence of air-breathing animals, even during these lower Silurian epochs. The tracks here described bear a strong resemblance to those found in the Potsdam sandstone, in the village of Beauharnois, on the south side of the St. Lawrence, twenty miles above Montreal, by Mr. Logan, the director of the Canada survey .f Its similarity has also been recognized by Mr. Hunt, of the Canada survey, who is familiar with the specimens collected by Mr. Logan. : It would appear highly probable, that the track in the Clinton group was made by an animal of the same class as that in the Potsdam sandstone, at a time when similar conditions prevailed in the pal\u00e6ozoic ocean, and when, in some degree, it was tenanted by similar organic forms, the Lingula being the prevailing fossil at both periods. * Mr. Logan was the first to announce the occurrence of foot-marks in the coal measures of Nova Scotia, which 'appeared to Professor Owen to belong to some unknown reptile. In 1844, Dr. King, of Greensburg, Pa.-, announced to the Academy of Natural Sciences, the occurrence, in the coal measures of that state, of the tracks of two Saurian reptiles. Lyell subsequently visited the locality, and considered them as belonging to the genus Cheiritheroum. In 1850, Mr. Lea, of Philadelphia, announced to the Academy of Natural Sciences, the discovery of the foot-prints in bas relief, of a reptilian quadruped, lower in the series than had before been observed, which he provisionally named Sauropus primevus. They occurred in a gorge of Sharp mountain, near Pottsville, Pennsylvania, in the red shale, or number eleven of Professor Rogers's classification. The position of these foot-marks is about 8500 feet below the upper part of the coal formation, which there is 6750 feet thick. Within the present year (1851), Professor Rogers has found, in the same basin, similar tracks to those described by Mr. Lea, as well as another S6t of smaller ones, reptilian in character, several hundred feet lower in the series. F. & W. t Professor Owen, of the Royal College of Surgeons, who examined a slab of these sand stones, on the upper surface of which the foot-prints are impressed, and a plaster cast of the remainder of the continuous trail, in all twelve and a half feet long, brought to London by Mr. Logan, has communicated to Sir Charles Lyell the following description, which the latter incorporated into his anniversary address, (February 1851.) \" The impressions are more numerous in regular succession than any that have been pre viously discovered ; so that the evidence of their having been made by successive steps, afforded by the succession of corresponding prints- at regular intervals, is the strongest we possess. They are in pairs, and the pairs extend in two parallel linear series with a groove midway between the two series. The outer impression ol each pair is the largest, and it is a little behind the inner one. Both are short and broad, with feeble indications of divisions at their fore-part \u2014 they succeed each other at intervals much shorter than that between the right and left pair. \"The median groove is well-defined, and slopes down more steeply at its sides, than towards its bottom, at some parts of the track. I conclude, from these characters, that the ani mal which lest the track was a quadruped, with the hind-feet larger and farther apart than the fore-feet; with both hind and fore-feet very short, or impeded by some other part of the ani mal's structure from making any but short steps ; that the fore and hind limbs were very near each other, but that the limbs of the right and those of the lest side were wider apart ; conse quently, that the animal had a short, but broad trunk, supported \u00abon limbs, either short, or capable of only short steps ; and that its feet were rounded and stumpy, without long claws. As to the median impression, that may be due either to a thick, heavy tail, or to the under surface of the trunk, dragged along the ground. The slope of the body and the structure of the limbs, indicated by the above described character of the steps, accord best with those 3f the land, or fresh-water tortoises, and the median groove might have been scooped out by the hard surface of a prominent plastron. The disproportion in the size of the fore-and hind-feet, is such as we find in some existing Terrapenes e. g. the Emys geographica.\""], [557, ""], [558, ""], [559, "[4] 219 Tracks of Crustaceans ? Plate XXXIII. Impressions consisting of two parallel linear imprints, or shallow grooves, extending continuously for short distances and again repeated at irregular intervals, either in the same or a slightly varying direction. Wherever there are several of these impressions near each other, only two lines are parallel, one with the other, and have no connection with any other series. The two lines are about three-sixteenths of an inch distant from each other, usually direct, sometimes undulating and sometimes making an abrupt curve. These linear grooves are usually of nearly equal depth throughout their length, but in some instances there is a decided pit at one extremity, as if the mud had been struck by a pair of parallel claws which were pressed backward, and the grooves gradually dying out in that direction. In one or two places, there appears to be a line of distinct, pitted impressions, continued in the same direction as the groove. In addition to the linear parallel grooves, there are, upon the slabs, numerous pitted impressions like those just noticed which are often in a continuous series, quite separate from any grooved lines, many of which are simple, while others present markings as of claws, or toes, like speci mens from the same rocks in New York. (Pal. Vol. II. p. 26, et passim.) Those now described appear to be due to crustaceans, rather than to any other animal, since they resemble, in some degree, marks made by existing species of that class of animals. The surface of the specimen on which these tracks are made, is covered with a thin film of shaly matter, in which are imbedded, apparently, the remains of the macerated skeletons of several Bryozoa, the structure of which is so obliterated, that their generic rela tions cannot be established. We have known, for many years, that the Clinton group of New York contains numerous trails made by different species of animals, or by ani mals of different size which may have been mollusks ; we have others which, by the peculiar fimbriated character, indicate other forms ; and we have those making distinct imprints, like foot-marks, with distinct toes, which clearly belong to still another class. To these three classes, we may now add those just described, which are quite distinct from either, and were unquestionably made by animals of a very different organization. We have, then, tracks and trails of five distinct types, which existed during the deposition of the Clinton group. Regarding, at the same time, the fact that no special attention has been given to the examination of these objects, the specimens being mainly those which have fallen under my observation while devoting myself to other objecls of pursuit, we may feel assured that we have much to learn in this field, which thus far has remained comparatively unexplored, but the results of which will richly reward him who undertakes it. Geological Position and Locality. \u2014 I have already spoken of the geo logical position and locality of the argillaceous and thin-bedded sandstones which bear these markings, be-ng u> the lower portion of the Clinton group, but above the Medina sandstone., as now restricted in New York. They"], [560, "m 220 are associated with strata which occur at the commencement of the upper Silurian epoch, belonging to that period of disturbance which preceded the formation of all those calcareous strata of the upper Clinton and Niagara groups, so highly charged with the remains of corals, crinoids, mollusks and trilobites. NIAGARA GROUP. The fossils found in this group are chiefly those which have been else where described ; many of which have been mentioned in the preceding pages, and, therefore, it is unnecessary to repeat them here, farther than to remark, that Catenipora escharoides, and two or more species of Heliolites, with one or two species of Astrocerium, are the characteristic ones of this group, throughout its range in this district. Nearly all the larger corals are identical with those in the same group, in western New York, and in Canada West, while the smaller ones are much less numerous in the Lake Superior district than at more eastern localities. The remains of Trilobites are extremely rare, and only some few fragments have been observed. The characteristic Brachiopoda are, also, almost entirely wanting at all the localities which I examined. Several species of Orthoceratites have been observed at different localities ; but they $re so poorly preserved in the rock, that they are of little interest. Among the more interesting fossils of this rock, are those peculiar forms described by Dr. Bigsby, in his paper on the geography and geology of Lake Huron, as Huronia.* In that paper, they were regarded as the remains of corals ; but, subse quently, Mr. Stokes corrects this opinion, and regards them as the probable siphuncles of Orthocerata. They are analogous, indeed, in their form and general appearance, to this portion of the Orthocerata ; but it is still very remarkable, that, in the numerous examples observed by Dr. Bigsby and Mr. Stokes, not one should have been found preserving some remains of the septa, or outer shell. The example of Huronia Portlockii, given by Mr. Stokes, (Geol. Trans., Second Series, Vol. V., p. 710, PI. IX., fig. 5,) does exhibit the appearance of septa ; but it appears to me that this, one is very different from the typical forms of the genus, and may well be referred to Ormoceras. If the exam ples, such as Huronia Bigsbii, and H. vertebralis, which are often found of considerable length, and in numerous individuals, prove to be the siphun cles of Orthocerata, they form an exception to the general condition of pre servation in these bodies ; for, in the strata where the remains of this family occur in the greatest abundance, and in all degrees of preservation, there are only rare examples of the siphuncle having been preserved without the septa. In fact, both are one and the same thing : an extension of a lamina of shell from the siphuncle, forming a septum, or, vice versa, the lamin\u00e6 of the septa curve around and enclose the open sippon tube. The rare examples alluded to in Ormoceras and Endoceras, where the siphuncle is preserved separate from the septa and outer shell, present a \u2022 Geol. Transactions, Second Series, Vol. I.

The apparent insertion of one joint within the other, in some species of Huronia, is a character much more like that of Cornulites, and their shell, the exterior of which is rarely preserved, is very like specimens of this genus. It may be due to the extreme concavity of the septum, and the enlargement of the siphuncle at the point where it is joined by the septum. Whatever may have been the original nature of those fossils, it appears to me that, even admitting them to have been siphuncles of some Ortho ceratite, they\" still preserve characters which entitle them to a separate generic description. Huronia vertebralis. Plate XXXIV., figure 1. Huronia vertebralis, Stokes, Geol. Trans. 2d Series, Vol. I., p. 202; Plate XXV1IL, figure 2. Tube elongated ; composed of joints, or articulations, of which the upper extremity is the largest, and the smaller and lower extremity of the suc ceeding one is apparently inserted within the upper edge of the preceding ; upper edge expanded and somewhat deflected. The surface sometimes presents longitudinal stri\u00e6, but I have been unable to detect any other structure, though, in some parts, the entire shell appear to be still remaining. A comparison of this fossil with some specimens of Cornulites, where the shell has been partially removed, shows a striking similarity m the structure and arrangement of the parts, except that in the latter fossil, the joints of which it is composed, diminish much more rapidly than in the Huronia. It is an interesting fact, however, that all known sptxties oi Cornulites belong to the Clinton and Niagara groups, and are of th\u00ab same epoch of the Huronia. The specimen figured is somewhat distorted by pressure, but th* pro portion of the parts and general form indicate the species describee, under this form by Mr. Stokes. v Geological Position and Locality. \u2014 This, and other specimens, were found by Messrs. Whittlesey and Desor, at Orthoceras Point, about eight \u25a0 miles east of the Detour, on the north shore of Lake Michigan, anfa from the position of this place, they occur in the central, or higher portion;* of the rock ; thus affording a new locality for these singular fossils.

In this species, the smaller end of the joint does not seem inserted into the expanded portion of the other, but to rest upon it, and in many of them, it appears as if expanded equally with the lower one, and that the two meet on the centre of the annulation, as shown in the figure by the dark line, which, in the specimen, appears like a suture. In this character, it pre sents a very remarkable similarity to a vertebral column and I should at once have referred it to H. vertebralis of Stokes, but that in his descrip tion the tapering downwards, and the inflation above are regarded as prominent characters. Our specimens agree better with the characters given to H. Bigsbii; but in the figure of that species the length and breadth of the joints is much more nearly equal than in our specimen ; the form of the joints is also more tapering, though I have observed this char acter in a few of the joints in the specimen figured. This character is somewhat apparent towards the right hand extremity of the figure. The extremes of measurement given by Mr. Stokes, however, are sufficient to make us hesitate in determining the species from the length and diameter of the joints. In this specimen, towards the right hand extremity, as shown in the figure, there is an appearance like a tube penetrating the interior, a char acter noticed by Mr. Stokes. When the specimen is broken, the interior presents an eccentric, tubular cavity, lined with crystals of carbonate of lime. In the present condition of the specimen, it is not possible to ascertain any connection between this tube and any other part. Both the specimens figured are in a light-grey sub-crystalline limestone from the same locality. The associated fossils are the following species of Discosorus and some trochiform Gasteropoda. DlSCOSORUS CONOIDEUS. Plate XXXIV., figures 2 and 3. Discosorus conoideus, Pal\u00e6ontology of N. Y., vol. II, p. 99, Plate XXVIII, figure 13, a, b, c. A conical body composed of a series of rings or discs, with rounded outer edges, and flattened above and below. Each succeeding ring, or disc, increases in size from the apex towards the base. These discs are composed of a thick crust, or shell, having a fibrous structure, which radiates from a small, central, tubular cavity, or space, filled by a different kind of material. This cavity may, perhaps, commu nicate with the internal, conical cavity, formed within the entire series of rings. The structure of the ring, in specimens of this fossil from New York, resembles more nearly that of the Belemnite than anything else with which I am acquainted. The specimens from Lake Michigan afford no new facts regarding the structure of this fossil. One of the specimens has the"], [565, "223 [ 4 ] two broader discs crushed, giving them apparently an abruptly increased diameter ; but this appearance is entirely accidental. The oblique direction of the discs and the curved form of the specimens are, in like manner, due to pressure. The other specimen has the edges of the discs \"worn down, the interior being crystallized, leaving only a thin exterior shell. This crystallized interior does not represent the cavity before alluded to, but is the substance of the thick shell, or crust, crystallized and partially removed, leaving a cavity. These fossils were first noticed by Dr. Bigsby, on Drummond's island, and were described and figured in the geological transactions before cited, but without a name, and, so far as I know, they have remained without farther notice, until the description cited above. I am unable to find any characters by which to separate the species, now described, from those found in the Clinton group in New York. Geological Position and Locality. \u2014 The specimens figured were found with Huronia, at Orthoceras Point, in limestone of the Niagara period ; and also in the same rock on Drummond's island. UPPER HELDERBERG LIMESTONES. Above the Niagara group, the first fossiliferous rocks belong to the age of the upper Helderberg limestones of New York, the intermediate space being occupied by the Onondaga salt group, which, so far as observed, is non-fossiliferous throughout the district. I have had no opportunity of examining any fossils of the rocks of this age, except those from Mackinac, among which are several corals, inden tical with those of the upper Helderberg, a Trilobite resembling Phacops bufo, a few Brachiopoda, which, from their condition, are not reliable, and those figured on Plate XXXV., which are recognized as species of the upper Helderberg group.

Frond flabellate ; branches slender, bifurcating, and slightly divergent ; united laterally by slender transverse filaments of the same substance as the branches. The substance of the fossil is carbonaceous, crumbling under pressure, and leaving only a black stain. This species resembles very nearly the Dictyonema gracilis of the Nia gara group, but the substance of the branches is thicker, and it does not show the stri\u00e6 or indentations so conspicuous on that one. In the species under consideration, I have not observed the separation of a thin horny crust from the internal portion of the branches, as is distinctly visible in D. gracilis."], [566, "[4] 224 Geological Position and Locality.\u2014 In the argillaceous limestone of Mackinac, associated with corals of the genus Callopora. Pr\u0153tus 1 Plate XXXV., figure .2. Tail having the axis marked by about nine or ten annulations, which are broad and rounded in the crust, but thin and sharp in the cast ; lateral lobes marked by six or seven ribs, which are slightly grooved on the upper side ; these all terminate in a narrow, thickened margin; the axis scarcely reaches this marginal fold, but terminates near enough to allow the space of the longitudinal furrows to pass around the apex. This fragment, which has a portion of the crust removed and otherwise not entire, so nearly resembles a species in the Schoharie grit, that I cannot doubt their identity. The number and character of the rings in the axis and the ribs on the lateral lobes correspond in the two species, and even the papillose markings on each side of the groove, in the lateral ribs of the tail, are the same in both. In the Schoharie specimen, the thorax has ten arti culations, the eyes are large and reniform, and the head is margined by a broad expansion, separated from the cheeks by a distinct narrow groove. The posterior angles of this marginal expansion were probably continued into spines, but in the specimen before me they are broken off.

Head somewhat semi-circular, with the posterior angles extended into spines ; a strong spine proceeding backwards from the centre of the base of the head ; glabella very narrow behind, but abruptly expanding before ; eye large and very prominent ; a broad, strong tubercle on the inner side of each eye, and separated from it by a furrow. The furrow separating the glabella from this tubercle is marked in the cast by two deep pits ; thorax with the usual number of articulations ; tail large and strong, projecting into a long and strong spine ; axis with ten to thirteen rings ; lateral lobes with seven to nine ribs. This fossil varies to an extreme degree in its general appearance, from the presence, or absence, of the crust which in the prolongation of the head"], [567, "Plate XXXV UPPER HELDERBERG GROUP ckerman Lifti,3'3Bronlway N Y"], [568, ""], [569, "225 r \u00bb] and the tail, gives to it very marked and positive characters. The speci men referred to by Brongniart, is a nearly entire individual, with the ex ception of the extremity of the tail and the spines at the base of the head, which are broken off, and the eyes somewhat mutilated. It was a cast of this specimen, now in the collection of the Albany Institute, which was sent by Dr. Hosack to the Academy of Sciences at Paris. It is the same specimen which Professor Green describes under the name of Calymene anchiops, in his monograph of the Trilobites of North America. The Msaphus laticoslalus of the same author, is the tail of that species entirely denuded of the crust, and presenting the rounded form, shown in the cast accompanying the monograph. This Trilobite is so peculiar in the form of the glabella and of the tuber cles within the base of the eyes, that these characters alone serve to distin guish it, even in the absence of others. In one of the iragments before us, the form of the glabella and the eye is well-preserved, and, at the base of the head, the impression of the central spine with a part of it still remaining. In this one, the lateral portions are broken off; but, in another specimen, this part is better preserved, though, in other respects, less characteristic. Fig. 3. a, A part of the head preserving the form of the glabella, the bases of the eyes and the large tubercles within the base of the eyes.

Geological Position and Locality. \u2014 These fragments occur in the cliff of the Arched Rock on the island of Mackinac. The facts bearing on the position of this rock have already been given, and the associated fossils would alone offer conclusive evidence of its age. The Trilobite here noticed is known in New York, everywhere restricted to the lower member ot the upper Helderberg group \u2014 the Schoharie grit. The species of Proetus which occurs in the same locality, at Mackinac, is found only in the Scho harie grit, in New York. The same rock contains a species of Phacops of the form of P. huso, but having a row of spines down the axis of the thorax. At a quarry in Mackinac, I found the impression of a similar Trilobite. We are already pretty well acquainted with the Trilobites of our succes sive groups, and though we may expect to find many new species, it is not to be, for one moment, regarded as probable that we shall find such an association of species passing from one rock into another ; for, thus far, we know that they are remarkably restricted in their geological range. It is quite probable that a more careful examination, at Mackinac, would enable us to detect the three distinct members which compose this group in the eastern part of New York. I here append a list of the fossils found within the Lake Superior district, as far as they have been determined. Of course it cannot be considered as very complete ; but, it is not probable that the number will be very con siderably increased for a long time to corne ; the region is too remote, and the exposure of the rocks too few to afford much encouragement to col lectors.

In the Niagara group, in all probability, the number of corals may be augmented by new discoveries ; though, from what I have already seen, it does not appear that many of the smaller bry ozooid forms will be found in this district, unless some locality should be found, more favorable for their growth than any yet observed on the north ern shores of Lakes Huron and Michigan. Judging from the character of the rock, it seems hardly possible that we shall be able to obtain, in any thing like a perfect condition, the species of Crinoidea which characterize the Niagara group farther east. Few of the Brachiopoda of this grouo have been recognized ; indeed, so unsatisfactory are the fragments of shells of this family, that, with one or two exceptions, they have been omitted from the list. These fragments indicate that Spirifer niagarensis and S. sulcatus, have extended westward through this district, and that they are known still farther west. Several of the strongly plicated species of Atrypa have existed in this district, but they occur only in fragments, or in a con dition too imperfect to be recognized. The entire list numbers about one hundred and fifty species, of which more than one hundred are from the lower Silurian strata ; twenty-six from the upper Silurian ; and sixteen from strata regarded as of Devonian age. It seems scarcely possible that, for a long time to come, the number of spe cies from the Silurian strata of this district can reach two hundred ; while we have already, from rocks of the same age, in their eastern prolongation, more than seven hundred well-known species. Notwithstanding, therefore, that some of the localities arjpear to be abundant, both in species and indi viduals, there is not to be found the great variety which characterizes more eastern localities. We have already shown the diminution in thickness of all the lower Silurian limestones, though we can recognize the period of each one, both by its representative beds, and by its characteristic fossils. It is true, that in the upper Silurian period, there is an augmentation of the cal careous beds ; but this increase is not accompanied by a corresponding accession of species, to what we find in the same beds, even when not so thick as in this district. The almost entire absence of the schistose and arenaceous beds has had some influence in diminishing the number of species of fossils ; for, in the Niagara group particularly, the smaller corals, the crinoids, and the Trilo bites, are confined to the shaly limestone and marls. The shaly and arena ceous beds of the Clinton group, with some calcareous bands of minor importance, afford, in the state of New York, more than one hundred spe cies of fossils. These are scarcely represented in the Lake Superior district, and, therefore, it is not proper to include the entire grouping in our com parison. The following table will present at once, without the necessity of farther explanation, the means of comparison :"], [576, "[4] 230 Table of the number of species of fossils found in the State of Menu York and the Lake Superior District. The great diminution of species, which is here so apparent, would seem to be due to other causes than those which would be assumed at first sight. We know that it is not always the deposits of the greatest thickness which afford the largest number of species, but that other conditions influence their scarcity or abundance. The small number of new, or undescribed, species which have been col lected over this wide area, is another surprising fact. Those which have been found to be new, have been collected almost entirely from strata of lower Silurian age, and amount to about ten per cent, of the whole number obtained. A few more could be added from the collection already made, which would, perhaps, increase the proportion to fifteen per cent., or about four per cent, of the whole number of species now known in the American lower Silurian strata. In a collection of lower Silurian fossils made in Tennessee, by Professor Safford, I recognized about one hundred known, and about fifty undescribed species, making, in all, about one hundred and fifty. In the region from which this collection was made, the formations are entirely calcareous, and occupy an extent much less than in the Lake Superior district, yet the proportion of new species in the former is four or five times as great as in the latter region. In both, we find new corals of the bryozooid type ; but in Tennessee, in addition to a much larger number of these, we find several new species of the larger, true corals, while all those hitherto described as occurring in rocks of this age, are found there. We cannot, therefore, hesitate to regard the pal\u00e6ozoic ocean, in the region of Tennessee, as having been more favorable to the growth of corals than that of the Lake Superior district. Tracing the same formations across to the Mississippi river, we find that the corals continue to be few in number, and new species have been rarely recognized. The whole series has, it is true, greatly diminished in thick ness^ and the supply of calcareous matter has disappeared, to a great extent, at the same time with the corals, so that the argillaceous matter predominates. The formation of these calcareous beds we know to have been dependent on the corals, crinoids, and other organisms, whose remains constitute the Lake Supe- rior Dis- trict. New York.

Should we find that these formations, in their northern exten sion, everywhere assume the same characters and undergo the same changes, we might be justified in concluding that there were some climatic influences operating to produce a diminution in the number of species in the north ; while towards the south, there is a constantly increasing ratio. The facts here briefly stated do exist ; the conclusions drawn from them may, perhaps, be modified, after more extended observations and collections have been made, both at the north and the south. These deductions, however, do not apply to the upper Silurian groups, since the facts show that, as far north as these strata have been traced, there has been an increase cf calcareous matter ; and we find the remains of corals in great abundance, though the number of species is not always very considerable in proportion to the amount of individuals. Whatever may be the final view with regard to the decrease of the lower Silurian limestones in importance and thickness, and the diminution of the number of species, of fossils, wre can confidently assert that the conditions of the ocean had undergone a change during the interval between the depo sition of the upper member of the lower Silurian, and the lowest beds of the upper Silurian and Devonian age. In considering the character of the pal\u00e6ozoic strata of the west, we ought not to lose sight of the fact, that, although there is an absolute aug mentation in the amount of calcareous matter in a south-westerly direction, yet this increase is by no means so great as would appear from a superficial examination. We shall probably find that, in a south-westerly direction from New York, there is a large increase in the thickness of all the groups, with the exception of the lower Silurian limestone. But as we go west and north-west beyond. Lake Michigan, it is doubtful whether their aggregate thickness is greater than in New York. The increase of the calcareous strata is made more prominent by the absence of the schistose and arenace ous beds which occupy so conspicuous a place in the series, in the more easterly localities. * These remarks refer to the fossiliferous beds above the calciferous sandstonr, or lower magnesian limestone."], [578, "[4] 232 CHAPTER XIV.

The drift proper, composed of strata of clay, sand and gravel, wilh boulders interspersed. II. Terraces, belonging to a later epoch. III. Alluvial deposits. The first division is by far the most important, forming, as we shall see, bluffs and ridges a hundred feet, or more, in height. In this connection, we shall describe the diluvial stri\u00e6 and furrows which have been observed at several points, the direction of which corresponds in a remarkable degree with those on the opposite slope. The coarse drift, described in a former report as occurring beneath the drift proper, at several points along the shore of Lake Superior, seems to be entirely wanting in this district. DRIFT PHENOMENA. The North Coast of Lake Michigan and West Coast of Green Bay \u2014 Although these coasts are lined with superficial deposits, which in some instances are very conspicuous, for instance, the dunes of Pointe aux Chenes and the gravel terraces of Mackinac, yet they do not generally belong to the true drift, but the alluvial period. The true drift deposits seldom approach the shore ; but, in ascending the rivers, they are met with at no"], [579, "[4j 233 great distance. Thus, on Pine river, we meet at first with banks composed of silicious sand to the height of eight or ten feet ; but, at the distance of a mile from the mouth, there is seen a stratum of tough, red clay, cropping out from beneath, in every respect similar to that bordering the outlet of Lake Superior, near Saut Ste. Marie, and, in all probability, it might be traced continuously from one lake to the other, since the intervening land does not here rise to any great height. In like manner, as will be shown, the drift deposits of the Menomonee, White-fish, Escanaba and Manistee, are relatively situated with regard to the lake. It is necessary that this peculiar distribution of the drift should not be lost sight of, for, otherwise, the geologist, who should merely coast along the shores, might infer that it occurred only in isolated patches, where as it covers nearly the whole intervening country between the two great lakes. Its absence from many parts of the coast is the result of a subsequent denudation, when the waters of the lake stood at a higher level than at the present time. I shall first describe the drift phenomena as observed along the coast, and next those of the interior, as observed in the valleys of the principal streams. The first locality to be mentioned lies hi the vicinity of Pointe aux Chenes. For a distance of six miles west, towards Manitou, or Payment Point, the coast is lined with dunes, or heaps of blown sand ; but before reaching it, there may be seen, at the bottom of the bay, a ridge rising immediately from the water's edge to the height of one hundred and sixty-two feet, and running parallel with the shore. Having ascended to the summit, we found a kind of undulating plateau, intersected by ravines, which appeared parallel to the bearing of the ridge. The most marked feature, however, was its steep slope \u2014 being, as we estimated, nearly 40\u00b0 \u2014 which would render the ascent difficult, but for the trees which grow upon it. Its structure is pecu liar, inasmuch as it is composed throughout of a very fine and homogeneous sand, similar to that which forms the dunes farther east, and one might be tempted to regard the whole as a gigantic dune, were it not for the regu larity of its outline, which is not in accordance with the hillock-shaped form of the latter. Its considerable slope is equally at variance with this feature ; for their slopes, in numerous examinations I have made, are seldom found to exceed 32\u00b0. It could not, therefore, be anything more than the accumu lation of very fine and homogeneous drift-sand ; 'and any doubt that I might have entertained originally, vanished when I afterwards found extensive tracts of the same materials along the Manistee river. There is no similar accumulation of drift to be observed along the north ern shore of the lake ; the whole coast, from Payment Point to the entrance of Big Bay des Noquets, being composed of projecting spits of flat lime stone and wide bays lined with blown sand. The eastern coast of Big Bay des Noquets presents a totally different aspect from that of the northern shore of Lake Michigan. After having passed Pointe Detour, the limestone strata are observed to rise in ledges to a moderate height ; but continue to increase in altitude until they attain one hundred and fifty feet, in a long and picturesque bluff at Bay des Noquets; and beyond they attain a greater elevation, being two hundred and fifteen feet. The same feature is maintained along the eastern shore of the bay, until we approach its extremity, where there is seen rising from the back ground, from amidst a flat country, a high ridge covered with pines. The"], [580, "[4] 234 occurrence of this kind of timber, which is altogether wanting on the top of the limestone cliffs, is, in itself, an indication of a change in the nature of the soil; and on examination, we found that the apparent ridge was merely the margin of a plateau which was seen stretching, for some distance, in an E.S.E. direction, and rising to the height of one hundred and thirty-six feet. The material was a fine and nearly homogeneous sand, like that before de scribed, but more loamy, with occasional pebbles of limestone, which showed that it was a sedimentary deposit, undoubtedly of the age of the drift. At the foot of the ridge, a spring was seen to issue, flowing perhaps over an impervious stratum of clay, although none was visible. The various islands near the entrance to Big Bay des Noquets are not without importance, in reference to the distribution of the superficial depo sits. The lower ones are generally destitute of drift, their margins, like the coast of the main land, being merely lined with seams of alluvial depo sits, either limestone pebbles or fine silicious sand. On some of the larger islands, for instance, that of Potawatomee, the summits of the cliffs are covered with a thick deposit of loamy drift-sand, intermingled with pebbles and boulders, very much like that of the Menomonee. Chambers's island, in Green Bay, is formed entirely of these materials, no rock whatever being visible. To conclude, the drift deposits near the head of Green Bay, although not strictly within the limits of our district, are too intimately connected with those of the interior, about the sources of the Mississippi, to be overlooked. There may be seen on the banks of the Fox, or Neenah river, opposite Fort Howard, a stratum of tough red clay beneath the alluvial belt, belonging, no doubt, to the same formation of drift clay which occurs in the Menomo nee region, and which, according to Mr. Whittlesey, forms a high bluff on the margin of Lake Winnebago. A short distance back of the river, this clay stratum is covered by the drift sand, forming a continuous plateau, on which the upper part of the town is built, and thence it spreads far into the interior. The thickness of the drift deposits at Green Bay has been ascer tained, by boring, to be one hundred and eight feet. This same reddish drift sand continues along the lake shore for some ten miles to the north-east of the village, to near the French settlement, where it forms bluffs some fifty feet in height ; but, according to Mr. Whitney, without being underlaid by clay. Drift of the Menomonee Valley. \u2014 Having followed this river from its mouth to near the junction of the Machi-gamig and Brule, where the united streams take the name of the Menomonee, and made excursions, at several points, into the interior, we had an opportunity of observing the drift over an extended area. It will be recollected that, along the shore of Lake Superior, on the op posite slope of the axis, stratified drift deposits of clay, sand and gravel were found as high as eight hundred and eighty-seven feet above the lake, in the vicinity of the iron mountain \u2014 township 47, range 27 \u2014 and that pebbles and boulders were also found at a height of one thousand feet. We did not attain so high a point on the southern slope, and I am there fore unable to describe, from personal observation, the character of the detri tal formations near the summit-level of the country ; but, according to Mr. Foster, there are accumulations of gravel and pobbles, occupying extensive reaches along the Machi-gamig, at a height c-\\ one thousand feet above the Jevel of Lake Superior ; and at a higher le^ Uk there are numerous otatruo*,"], [581, "235 [ 4 ] oons in the stream eansed by an aggregation of hornblende end granite boulders, around which it is necessary to make portages. In fact, boulders may be said to be perched upon the very summit of the country. There is no country where the drift plays a more conspicuous part than near the junction of the Machi-gamig and Brule. In many places, espe cially between the Twin and Great Bekuenesec falls \u2014 township 40, range 30 \u2014 the river banks are composed of drift, forming bluffs one hundred feet and more in height. A remarkable instance may be seen a few miles above the latter falls, on the left bank, where the whole mass is, for some distance, laid bare from its summit to its base, so as to afford a most admirable sec tion. It is composed chiefly of a loamy sand, very indistinctly stratified, with several layers of gravel, more or less coarse, interspersed through it. Boulders were scarce, except near the summit, where they seemed rather crowded together, so as to form a sort of stratum. On the opposite or right bank, the detrital deposit rises still higher, forming a terrace of some forty feet, above which there is a steep slope leading to a plateau nearly one hun dred feet higher, with numerous boulders scattered over the surface. Although the bluff on the left bank formed a natural section of nearly one hundred feet ; yet, no evidences of a clay stratum were revealed. If it exists at all, it must be beneath the level of the river ; but it will be seen hereafter that the clay occurs only at low levels. There are other places in the neighborhood, where the drift deposits rise still higher ; but, instead of forming steep bluffs, they are fashioned into hills, covered %vith dense vegetation. Having ascended one of these hills, opposite the mouth of Muskos river\", which, from its form and outline, was supposed to be granite, I was much surprised to find that it was composed of the same materials as the bluffs. Since fires had recently swept over the whole of this region, an opportu nity was afforded for noticing the contour of the ground over a wide range. It was found that the drift\" hills were not merely limited to the borders of the river, but stretched far inland, especially on the right, where they assumed the form of a wide plateau with numerous ridges, giving it an undulating surface, like the rolling prairies of Illinois. The ridges appeared to be composed of rather coarse materials, and along their slopes and over their summits were scattered numerous boulders, composed of such \"neks as wpre knov.'u to occur in the region to the north ; such as hor .blende and talcose rocks, with some blocks of saccharoidal limestone. From the Twin falls, where the same character prevails, we proceeded in a northern direction, in search of the limits of the older sandstone strata, crossing, first, an elevated plain of drift sand, about two hundred feet above the bed of the river, and several miles wide, covered with aspen and dwarfed pines. (Pinus Banksiana.) This is bounded on the north by a series of low ridges, apparently of the same drift-sand, when we come to a small lake, to which we gave the name of Lac Fumee. To the north, the surface suddenly rises in steep ridges, attaining an elevation of two or three hundred feet above the water. The drift with whi< h these ridges are covered is no longer fine sand and gravel ; but very coarse rubble, sometimes wholly composed of rounded boulders. These ridges extend northward for some miles, to near the Correction line between townships 40 and 41, where the drift gradually disappears, leaving the surface bare along the whole range of hills Proceeding along the line eastward, the hills, for several miles, consist"], [582, "[ 4 ] 236 of quartzose rocks, with very little loose material, except huge boulders, derived from the adjacent ledges. The prominent ledges showed distinct traces of glacial action on their northern slopes ; but, on the south, they were generally rough and precipitous. At the corner of sections 32 and 33, range 29, there may be seen naked quartzose knobs, with vertical walls sixty feet high, fronting the south, while the northern slope is rounded and smoothed, \u2014 thus showing, in a striking manner, the contrast between the lee and the strike-side. Stri\u00e6 were also observed on some of these rounded and polished rocks. The range of hills near the Correction line does not, however, mark the limit of the drift, for, in proceeding northward, Mr. Whittlesey again found these deposits, together with boulders, in great quantities, as far as the centre of township 41, where they again disappear. Returning from the northern limit of this township towards the Menomonee, he describes the country as follows : \" Along the line of the section, from the northern extremity to the mid dle of township 41, the rocks are principally bare of drift ; for the next three miles, or half a township south, they are concealed by a deep cover ing of drift, which here consists of a mixture of sand and gravel, bearing, as usual, a great number of excellent pines. After crossing the range of syenite and quartz rocks, which are exposed for three-fourths of a mile along the Correction line, the land rises rapidly between sections 10 and 11, and is composed of a prodigious mass of rounded boulders, from one to three feet in diameter. Here, although there is scarcely any dirt or gravel, but only heaps of large stones, the white cedar flourishes in great abun dance. Passing over this rise of, say, one hundred and fifty feet, we descend to a stream, along the line between sections 14 and 15, and ascend the next range, which rises about two hundred feet. Its northern slope, like the last, is made up of a mass of large boulders, without an admixture of earth. Among them were seen all the varieties of the rocks which occur to the north, but the quartz and quartzose rocks predominated. The drift of the southern slopes is sometimes coarse, but never composed wholly of rounded boulders.\" The lower portion of the basin of the Menomonee is, in every respect, more uniform. As an interesting feature, however, may be mentioned the occurrence of ridges with steep slopes; which is the more extraordinary, as the surrounding country is rather level. In a pine opening, on the left bank, three miles above the upper saw-mill, a ridge of this character is seen stretching, for a long distance, in a south-south-west direction, about forty feet in height above the surrounding plain, and sixty-one above the river, the drift terrace, on which it rests, being eighteen feet. The average width of this ridge is about ten feet, and its average slope from 25\u00b0 to 30\u00b0, but its maximum is 34\u00b0. This ridge reminded me strongly of similar ones found in the vicinity of Andover, Mass., where they go by the name of Indian ridges, it having been supposed by some that they were the work of the aborigines. It also reminded me, more vividly than anv others which I saw in the West,of those curious ridges in eastern Sweden, familiar to European geologists, under the name of osars, or giant roads. Another striking peculiarity is, that the ridge itself is composed of very coarse materials, with many pebbles and boulders ; whereas, the plateau on which it rises is composed of fine, homogeneous sand, indicating a dis-"], [583, "237 [4] turbed condition of the waters posterior to the ouiet deposition cf the drift sand. Descending from the head of the Menomonee towards its .south the drift deposits on its banks decrease in thickness, ar.d at the same time become finer. This change is peculiarly striking in the vicinity of the White i aphis, where they are seen at a considerable elevation; but, farther down, they seldom reach higher than fifteen or twenty feet. There is, however, ore place in the Big Bend, below Kitson's trading-house, where it is observed at a height of fifty-four feet, while at the Pemenee falls, at one place, the drift terrace is only six or ten feet high. At Grand rapids, it is only six feet, the material being generally _a fine, loamy sand, with indistinct traces of stratification and diagonal stratifica- tion, such as frequently occurs in the superficial deposits\". Occasionally, however, the drift terrace rises to the height of twenty-five or thirty feet, as for instance at the saw-mill, sixteen miles above the mouth of the river. Drift-clay was met with at four places along the river, and always near the water's edge. The following are the localities where we observed it : near Menomonee City ; at a place some miles above the saw-mill ; below Sturgeon falls and at the head of Sandy portage, where it occurs ; for some distance in the bottom of the river, as we had occasion to observe when poling, our poles sticking in the stiff clay ; we found it to be very adhesive, and of the same red color as that on the borders of Lake Superior. Although the width of the valley increases as we descend the river, vet it is narrower than that of some other rivers of less importance, as for in- stance that of the Manistee. There are many places where it is lined by the drift terrace, on either bank; although, in most cases, one bank is lined with drift, while the other is alluvial. The phenomena of glacial furrows and stri\u00e6 are abundantly displayed along the Menomonee, as will be seen in a subsequent chapter. There are, be- sides, many localities where the rocks, without being striated, exhibit those rounded and smoothed outlines, known as fleecy rocks (roches moutonnees), and which, to the geologist, are conclusive evidence that the localities where they occur have been subjected to powerful glacial action. As a locality where this feature is seen on a grand scale, I would mention the portage around Sturgeon falls. The rock is here composed of a crystalline talcose slate, somewhat syenitic in its appearance, and which, from its tough nature, is is admirably fitted for resisting the destructive influence of the atmosphere. When walking over these rounded and smooth ledges, along the deep chasm, in which the Menomonee rushes and falls in a series of cascades, I might easily have imagined that I was again wandering along one of the torrents of the Alps, so great is the similarity, both in a picturesque and geo- logical point of view ; but, above all, in reference to these peculiar appear- ances of the rocks. Drift of the Valley of the Manistee. \u2014 This river, which empties into lake Michigan, is composed of two main forks \u2014 the one coming from the west and forming on its way the Manistee lake ; the other coming from the north, where its sources interlock with those of the Tequamenon of Lake Superior. The whole area drained by this river is a vast swamp, the rocks being visible only in a few places in its bed, where they occasionally give rise to"], [584, "238 [4] rapids; but rising nowhere, as far as our investigations go, above the water. The banks are composed either of drift, or of alluvial deposit. In many places there are no banks at all, the ri-ver winding its way through a suc cession of swamps and low lands. As a farther peculiarity of this river, the main rapids are near its mouth, there being nonein its upper course; whereas, in most rivers they are concentrated near their sources. Starting from the saw-mill at its mouth, we found the river-bed much w.der than we anticipated ; its brown swampy waters flowing, with a gentle current, between banks of fine alluvial sand. These are at first only a few feet high, and of doubtful origin; but, ere long, they grow somewhat higher and their true character becomes apparent. Ascending first the right fork,' we soon reached the Manistee lake, with the little thriving Indian village on its northern shore. The Niagara limestone, which appears in regular and horizontal layers in several places, and especially in the vicinity of the village, is covered by a layer of reddish, sandy loam, containing granitic pebbles, intermixed with those of limestone. We could not, therefore, fail to recognize in it the representative of the true drift, such as is found on Lake Superior, and on the summit of the island of Mackinac. It seems to afford a good agricultural soil, for we saw there, not only potatoes, but also corn and peas thriving finely, cultivated by a settlement of Indians, who, to their credit be it said, form here an industrious and prosperous little colony.* Proceeding from the lake up the river, we passed through a low, marshy country, being for many miles one continuous swamp. There are but few places where the banks rise much above the river. Near the main fork, however, township 42, range 17, where the river cuts through a ridge about twenty feet high, the banks are composed of fine, homogeneous sand, apparently without stratification, so that it might readily be mistaken for an ancient dune of blown sand. On closer examination, however, I dis covered several granitic pebbles, which are sufficient proof that the whole ridge belongs to the drift. We were informed by Mr. Merryweather, of the corps of linear surveyors, whom we met here, that the same character prevailed throughout the whole neighborhood; the country being composed of swamps with occasional pine ridges similar to that above described. Drift of the Main Branch of the Manistee. \u2014 The main branch of the Manistee has a more uniform character than the one described above. It is a quiet and fine stream without either rapids, narrows, lakes, or islands ; but flows through a regular channel all the way from the confluence of the left branch to near its origin ; so that were it not for the rafts caused by the accumulation of timber, the river would be easily navigable for boats and canoes. Throughout its whole length, it has, almost everywhere, a well-defined margin, although of rather unequal height; high banks sometimes succeed ing abruptly to low ones, or the bank on one side being very high, while that of the other is quite low. This contrast is particularly striking vicinity of the Upper forks. Here, however, it is very crooked, and I noticed that the high banks were generally at the head \"of the meanders. This led me to examine more closely into the composition of both the * They not only cultivate the soil to supply their own wants, but, as we were informed, had saved some money in order to buy the land, when it is brought into market."], [585, "239 4] higher and lower bluffs, and I found that, whereas the latter were com posed of a loamy sand without any gravel or stones whatever, the higher bluff, although composed likewise of fine materials, contained in some places strata of gravel and even pebbles, \u2014 the latter being partly granitic and partly limestone. We had, besides, noticed in several places a layer of clay beneath the sand of the higher bluff, which was nowhere to be seen in the lower. Thus, we could not fail to recognize in the higher, true drift deposits, whereas the lower are undoubtedly alluvial. There is occasion ally some difficulty in ascertaining this fact, on account of the considerable thickness of the alluvial deposits and their great similarity to the true drift. The width of the valley of the Manistee, which, according to our estimates, averages nearly a quarter of a mile, is another remarkable feature, when we consider that the valleys of other rivers of larger size, as for instance that of the Menomonee, are much narrower. There, we have seen, that in many places the drift terrace occurs on both banks of the river ; but this is never the case on the Manistee, at least not in its lower and middle portions. In consequence of the great width of the valley, the river fre quently keeps at a distance from either bluff, and is lined only by alluvial banks ; but, wherever it has a serpentine course, it invariably intersects the drift bluff at the head of the meander. It is quite a striking feature that the vegetation on the drift bluffs, at the head of the meanders, is entirely different from that of the opposite bank, it being composed of pines (red and white) with some aspen; while the alluvial bank opposite is invariably covered with elms and maples, and sometimes with white cedar. At first, I ascribed this distinction to the mere fact that the drift bank was higher and dryer, and, therefore, more appropriate for pine growth ; but, afterwards, became satisfied that the composition of the drift-soil was not without its influence, for I found the same character of vegetation growing on these terraces, where their level was not higher than that of the alluvial terrace. Thus, in descending the river, we could always know, from the mere appearance of the vegetation, whether we were upon the alluvium, or the drift. The drift clay, without being as conspicuous as along Lake Superior, is well marked, in many places, below the drift sand. It does not generally reach more than four or five feet above the river, although in one place I found it to be ten feet thick. It is very tough, and generally flesh-colored, but in one instance it was perfectly white. There were observed, in several localities, rather coarse pebbles of limestone, and even flat stones, intermixed with the upper layer of clay, near its contact with the sand. This was especially the case at the first high drift-bluffs which we met with, a few miles below the forks, in ascending the river. Continuing on, the drift-bluffs increase in height. Between the confluence of the two upper branches, (township 43, range 14,) their height is from sixty to seventy feet. This, however, does not prevent the adjacent country from being very swampy. Having been obliged to leave our boat, on account of a large raft near the township line between townships 42 and 43, we decided to proceed by land till we should find the outcrop of the Trenton limestone. Having thus crossed the country in several directions, we are enabled to say that at least one-half of the surface drained by the left branch of the Manistee, is composed of cedar swamps. In some places \u2014 as, for instance\u2014 in township 44, range 13, the dry spots are so limited,"], [586, "thai rhey appear actually like islands in a sea, being composed of sand-. ri.l . -s pavered with yellow and wnite pine. A similar belt of pine land lines the river, or rather the valley, through out it. whole length, and the approach to it is always indicated, in this region, by a strip of dry soil, which is no doubt owing to the drainage. The timber is, however, smaller than on the rivers emptying into Green Bay. ; ,'.\u201e'' In connection with this subject, I cannot refrain from alluding to a cir cumstance which has often surprised and perplexed me. When we consider the materials of which the drift of the Manistee region is composed \u2014 very fine, silicious sand, forming bluffs, in some places as high as seventy feet, without any impermeable layer except the clay at its base, which does not rise higher than ten feet \u2014 it seems but natural that the banks of the river should be dry for a considerable distance. This, however, is not always the case. In climbing up the bluff, I was often astonished to find that the timbered portions occupied but a narrow belt, as it were a mere embank ment to the extensive swamps in the rear. This is the case at a locality on the river, in township 44, range 13. The bluff is here some sixty feet high, composed, throughout, of fine sand, except at the base, where there is a layer of clay eight feet thick. But, in spite of that, the belt of pine land is less than one hundred yards wide ; it then slopes down fifteen feet, and immediately the pine trees are replaced by cedar and tamaracks, grow ing on a wet ground. A distance, therefore, of less than one hundred yards is sufficient to prevent the drainage, although the swamp is forty-five feet above the level of the river. In order to ascertain if the swamp was not occasioned, by some impermeable layer near the surface, I examined carefully the roots of the fallen logs, and found them enclosed in the same fine, silicious sand which forms the bluffs. Having submitted the question to my friend M. Lesquereux, of Ohio, an eminent botanist who has thoroughly investigated these subjects, I beg leave to insert here his views. In a communication, dated December 12, 1850, he says : \" The fact you point out is not new ; it almost always occurs in this formation of peat bogs, or, indeed, of cedar swamps, which are the same thing. If you examined attentively what you call the fine sand of the banks of the river Manistee, I think you must have observed that it is not a true sand, but a loamy, argillaceous, impermeable alluvium. This sand is found in all the peat-bogs of Europe : in Switzerland, in Germany, in Sweden, in Denmark and Holland \u2014 everywhere it is the same. I have invariably found, on putting a handful or two of this sand into a funnel, that it resisted the passage of water to a really astonishing degree.* But, even supposing your designation to be correct, and the sand of the Manistee be really permeable, the following explanation is none the less satisfactory: When a river overflows its banks, the slimy sediment is deposited, of course, at the edge of the current, and where its force ceases ; and thus a ridge is formed along the banks, behind which, on the retreat of the river, there re mains stagnant water. This is the origin of peat-bogs. The first growth of the still water is the Chara, a plant of a peculiar composition, containing a large quantity o-f silica, and to the decomposition of which I attribute, in a great measure, the formation of the clay found in peat-bogs. The idea ot * The sind of the Manistee is entirely different from this loamy alluvium alluded to by M. Leiipereux."], [587, "241 [41 attributing a geological formation to vegetable decomposition may seem to you extraordinary, at least ; but, if I am able* to complete my work on the influences of vegetation, I hope to establish this, and other facts at least as curious. Next to the Chara comes the Sphagnum. To enable these plants to grow, requires only a hollow, in which moisture can lodge, and a sew fragments of woody fibre. My examinations of these curious mosses have proved that, in moist climates, on the banks of rivers, or on mountains covered with clouds, their existence and their growth is by no means neces sarily dependent upon the soil which they cover ; for these mosses, by their peculiar conformation, are so exceedingly hygroscopic that they imbibe moisture in all parts of their tissue, both from the base upwards, and by their leaves, stalks, &c. This peculiarity is not due, as some have supposed, to a mechanical capillarity ; but to the nature of their tissue, to the disposition of their fibres, and to the entire absence of chlorophyl, wherein these plants resemble the most simple substances ; for vegetable tissue, as you know, is hygroscopic in proportion to its freedom from particles of a foreign nature. I shall give a more satisfactory exposition of this matter in a special work; but you have often observed, without doubt, the curious hygroscopic pow er of Sphagnum ; for, if you pull off a tuft, even from the driest part of a swamp, on pressing it between your fingers, you will always find water running from it, as from a sponge. These plants, in this way, imbibe mois sure from the atmosphere, if they cannot obtain it from the soil. Thus, a tuft of Sphagnum, weighing, in a completely dry state, three pennyweights, twelve grains, suspended in the air during a foggy night, absorbed seven grains of water. On the other hand, evaporation by the tissue is exces tively slow and out of proportion to the absorption. Another tuft of Sphag num, about twenty-two inches in superficial extent and four and one-half high, and weighing, when dried, one ounce, twenty-one penny-weights, was put into a vase having at the bottom a hole of half an inch in diameter. Through this hole, and touching the water with one-fourth of a line of the ends of its stalks, the tuff became completely saturated in less than two hours, having absorbed a pound of water. The same tuft, being then exposed to the air and sun for thirty-six hours, lost only five ounces by evaporation. Upon the basis of these facts, you may easily follow the operations of nature in the formation of cedar-swamps. When a little water remains in a hollow,'and becomes saturated with humic acid, by the decomposition of vegetable substances, sphagnum imme diately establishes itself. You know how it grows, in compact tufts, and even if the water should escape, it will continue to grow, and by degrees will cover very dry soils ; for we see it in moist climates, for example, in the mountains of Ireland, in the Vosges, in the Harz, climbing up slopes of 25\u00b0 and 30\u00b0, and covering bare granite rocks. A little moisture on the soil, in the spring, is sufficient to make the spores germinate, the atmos phere furnishing the necessary moisture for subsequent vegetation. I remember, in this connection, that one day as I was descending the slope of the Brocken, I slipped on a wet rock, and coming down upon my back, found myself buried under a carpet of Sphagnum more than a foot thick, from which I had some trouble in extricating myself. You, yourself, remark that the pines are not fond of moisture. As these mosses spread, they exclude the air from the roots of the pines, when they die and disappear ; whilst a favorable soil is formed for the cedars, which"], [588, "C 4 ] 248 represent, in America, the Pinus pumilio of Europe. On the sandy banks of the river, where the slope favors drainage, Sphagnum cannot grow, and thus the pine and spruce thrive. You ask me why it is that the Sphagnum does not form peat ? It is because the slow combustion of wood, which forms this substance, can not take place except under water, and where there is a permanent supply. So soon as it runs off, the air reaches the lower part of the stalks, the increase of oxygen decomposes and destroys them, so that, after ages of these little vegetables, (which nevertheless contain more woody substance in proportion than the hardest oaks and pines) there remains only a very thin layer of black earth mixed with sand.\" En resume ; as a peculiar feature of the drift of this part of the district, I would farther mention the almost entire absence of boulders, either in it, or over its surface. In various excursions, we did not observe more than three ; the largest one, of hornblende, in township 44, range 12, did not measure more than three feet in length. DRIFT OF THE WHITE-FISH RIVER. Throughout the whole region drained by the White-fish and its branches, according to Mr. Whitney, drift is spread over nearly the entire surface to a considerable depth, so as to effectually conceal the rocks, except in the beds of the rivers, and other places where it has been removed by the action of water since its deposition. On the trail from the mouth of this river to the shore of Lake Superior, opposite Grand island \u2014 a distance of some fifty miles \u2014 not a rock in place is to be seen ; even boulders are few in number. The drift is spread very uniformly and evenly over the southern portion of this region, and is made up of fine, reddish, quartzose sand, with but few pebbles, forming nearly level plains, covered with a fine growth of Norway pines, particularly in township 42, range 20. These plains are occasionally varied, for a short distance, by ridges and knobs ; but, in general, present a great uniformity and monotony of aspect. Along the course of the White-fish, the drift has been excavated so as to leave a wide swamp on each side, in which the rock lies near the surface. The thickness of this sandy deposit is from fifty to one hundred feet. As we approach Lake Superior, the country becomes more broken and diversified wtih ridges, but is still deeply covered with drift. A few granite boulders are seen, even on the highest point of the dividing ridge, which is not over four hundred feet above the lake. The same sandy plains extend west, through townships 44 and 45, to the Escanaba, and cover several hundred square miles. The same is true, also, of the region lying to the east of the White-fish, and that about the sources of the Manistee. The descent of these streams is gentle, and little broken by rapids. DRIPT ALONG THE ESCANABA. The drift along the Escanaba resembles, in many respects, that of the Menomonee and of the Manistee, as will be seen from the following obser vations, made by Mr. Hall : \" At the mouth of the Escanaba, and along the west side of Little Bay des Noquets, there is a great accumulation of fine drift, mostly sand above,"], [589, "243 [4] with pebbles below. Above the first fall of the river, and particularly eight or nine miles from the mouth, there is much coarse drift, covered by fine materials, fifty feet or more deep. Beyond this place, to the second fall, and for several miles above, in fact to the forks of the river, there is scarcely any drift visible, the rock being covered merely by a deposit of impure peat from two to four feet thick. Above the forks, we again find the fine sand and small pebbles, the lower part coarse all the distance. Near the junction of the stratified rocks with the igneous, or from the point where I last saw the stratified rocks, until I came to the igneous masses, the accumulation of drift is greatest. Just below the syenitic ridges, I found ridges of drift from twenty to fifty feet high, some distance from the river. I examined these, supposing that they might be of rock, but found nothing except, here and there, a boulder. I learned from Mr. Sinclair, that the sand continues from the mouth of the river northward, and extends to within a few miles of the eastern branch all the way to the forks ; but that, on the west side, this kind of drift is hardly seen below the forks, unless farther than he had penetrated, or farther than I travelled, on that side. I saw the same kind of material at Fort river. I saw no clay stratum, except at the meadow, nine miles above the mouth, where it occurs beneath gravel, with sand above.\" GLACIAL FURROWS AND STRI\u00c6. The phenomenon of glacial furrows and stri\u00e6, on the southern slope of the upper peninsula of Michigan, is much more marked than might, at first, oe expected, considering that the prevailing rocks are limestone, of a more or less destructible kind. Starting from Mackinac westward, we noticed glacial furrows in the fol lowing localities : 1. At the bottom of St. Martin's Bay, two miles north of Pine river, on a point composed of almost horizontal ledges of limestone. The surface of the rock was well-polished, with many distinct furrows, some of them mea suring one quarter of an inch in width, and extending over wide areas. Their average direction is from east to west, some running N. 80\u00b0 E., and others S. 70\u00b0, and 8 j\u00b0 E. There are, besides, well-defined troughs, occur ring in the same direction. . 2. At Payment Point, the rocks are distinctly smoothed and rounded, in spite of the many small cavities which are scattered through them. At the bottom of the cove, the furrows are very distinct ; but, at the Point itself, they are indicated chiefly by a greater regularity of the small cavities. One might almost believe that the formation of the latter had been influenced by the furrows, the direction being from N. 50\u00b0 to N. 60\u00b0 E. 3. At the bottom of Big Bay des Noquets, on the west shore of the eastern cove, there are seen distinctly polished and striated surfaces on a stratum of limestone belonging to the Hudson-river group. The direction of the stri\u00e6, which are here rather fine, is from east to west. 4. At the mouth of the Escanaba, in Little Bay des Noquets, the surface of the Trenton limestone ledges was observed by Messrs. Whitney and Hall to be, in several places, most admirably polished, with fine stri\u00e6 run ning north-east and south-west. 5. At Oak Orchard, on the west shore of Green Bay, we found the"], [590, "i 4] 244 direction of the stri\u00e6, which are here very distinct, from N. 15\u00b0 to N. 20\u00b0 E. 6. The banks of the Menomonee afforded various opportunities for ob serving the effects of glacial agents on the rocks. At the saw-mill, near the mouth of the river, the strata of Trenton lime stone are distinctly polished, and marked by stri\u00e6 running nearly east and west. At a locality six miles above Kitson's trading-house, there may be seen, in the ' river, several islands of tough talcose slate, most admirably polished and rounded (moutonnes), with indications of stri\u00e6 running E.N.E. and W.S.W. At another locality, three miles above Sturgeon falls, the stri\u00e6 occur on a very hard greenstone rock, running N. 65\u00b0 E. At the foot of the lower Bekuenesec falls, on a hard talcose rock; direc tion N. 70\u00b0 E. At the lower Twin fall there are smoothed and fleecy rocks, with stri\u00e6 running from N. 60\u00b0 to N. 70\u00b0 E. Finally, the upper Twin falls deserve a special notice, there being no other place along the river, and, I may say, in the whole district, where glacial phenomena are more distinct than at the foot of this fine cascade. The rock, a hard and black slate, is so well polished that it glitters ' in the sun like a mirror, and most of the stri\u00e6 are as distinct as if they had*been engraved but yesterday. Their direction is from N. 65\u00b0 to N. 70\u00b0 E. I noticed, however, that the polish and stri\u00e6 did not extend beneath the water, but that the surface of the rock was rough, and, as it were, corru gated, so far as the waves caused by the cascade reached. A conclusive proof that they had not been formed by water. There are, besides, many places where the ledges are merely rounded or moutonnes, the structure of the rock having been too coarse to retain the stri\u00e6; as, for instance, at Pemenee and Quiver falls, and especially over the portage of Sturgeon falls. The rock, at this latter place, being coarse grained and highly crystalline (a kind of protogine), and its rounded out line looking like a succession of large wool-sacks, heaped up one above the other, reminded me strongly of the similar masses which I had observed near the Scandinavian cascade of Trolhatta. In addition to the above localities, I may be allowed to mention here the following, which were observed by Messrs. Hall and Whittlesey, on their way from Green Bay south-westward, in Wisconsin. At Mehoggan Point ; large polished surfaces, with stri\u00e6 running N.E. by E. and N.N.E. At Mehoggan falls, on Niagara limestone, the stri\u00e6 running N.E. by N. At a locality three miles west of Milwaukee, polished* slabs of Niagara limestone, with stri\u00e6 bearing N.E. At Strong's landing, (Fox river), on metamorphic slate, N.E. by E. By comparing the direction of the stri\u00e6 in the various localities above mentioned, it will be seen that their average distribution is from N.E. to S.W. \u2014 the extreme deviation being N. 70\u00b0 to 80\u00b0 W.; whereas, no locality was noticed with stri\u00e6 running west of north, or even north and south. This average direction agrees very well with the prevailing direction on the * I visited this locality myself, the year previously, in company with Mr. Lapham, and, having taken the exact bearing of the stsi\u00e6 at the top of a quarry close by the road, found it tobeN. 60\u00b0E."], [591, "245 [4] southern slope of Lake Superior, as described in my report for 1849. The only difference to be noticed between the two slopes is this: that while there are, on the shore of Lake Superior, some sets of stri\u00e6 running north and south, we find here, on Lake Michigan, other sets running east and west, but the prevailing direction, in both districts, is the same; thus showing that the agent which engraved them, whatever may have been its nature, acted independently of the inequalities of the soil ; for even the high ridge, between the two slopes, did not interfere with its direction. ROCKS BROKEN BY DRIFT AGENCIES. In connection with this general direction of the drift agencies from north to south, as indicated by the direction of stri\u00e6 and furrows, as well as by the transportation of the boulders, I would mention another very curious feature, which was noticed on the southern shore of Lake Superior. Near the Jackson forge, on Carp river, the talcose slates are seen in a low ridge, where the rock has been quarried, to some extent, for building the forges. The slates stand nearly vertical ; but the upper portion of the ledge is seen to have been abruptly broken off at a depth from ten to fifteen feet be low the surface. The broken and shattered portion of the rock has been carried forward in the direction of the drift-current, and lies embedded in the drift, on the southern side of the ridge, as represented in the annexed figure : Fig. 23 Broken Strata at Jackson Forge. 1. Slates. 2. Drift-gravel. Similar fractures of the strata have been noticed in other regions. One of particular interest, from its extent, occurs at Guilford, Vt., at a locality known as the Bruce slate-quarry, and has been fully described by President Hitchcock, in his report on the geology of Massachusetts. The cause of this curious phenomenon was considered by him, in accordance with the views of Mr. Darwin, to have been the sudden impact of a large mass of floating ice ao-ainst the projecting ridge. What gives a peculiar interest to the broken strata at the Jackson forge, is the fact that the broken masses of slate have been carried forward in the direction of the drift current, and are imbedded in strata of drift, as seen in the diagram, thus showing that the break must have taken place, previous to, or rather during, the deposi tion of the drift \u2014 the broken portions being both overlaid and underlaid by it. The extent of the broken strata is, in itself, sufficient evidence that nothing but a sudden, or violent stroke, such a one as we might imagine"], [592, "[4] 246 would be caused by the shock of an iceberg, \u2014 would account for such a break. On the other hand, the sharp edges of the broken portions, and the manner in which they are found abutting against the vertical strata, show that they must have been buried in the drift, soon after the fracture took place. ORIGIN OF THE LIMESTONE PEBBLES IN THE DRIFT OF LAKE SUPEBIOR. It is not uncommon to find limestone pebbles intermixed with the granite pebbles and boulders, in the drift of the upper lakes. Along Lake Michi gan, their occurrence is easily accounted for by the fact that the rock, in situ, is mostly limestone. It is not so in regard to those found along the beaches and terraces of Lake Superior. Limestone is nowhere to- be found on the north shore of that lake, and, on the south shore, we know there occur merely some isolated patches in Sturgeon valley, belonging to the lower Silurian, from which the pebbles along the beach, both on the north and south shore, are entirely different, both in their lithological character, and in their fossils. They are of a pure white limestone, and contain fossils which are characteristic of the Niagara group, such as Cyathophyllum, Favosites, &c, which are occasionally so well preserved that they can be identified without the least difficulty. Among the specimens collected on the south shore, near the mouth of Chocolate river, there is a specimen of Favosites four inches in diameter, which is so well preserved, that its finest partitions are recognizable. The quest'on naturally suggests itself, where is the source from which they were derived ? There having been thus far no indications of any limestone formations north of Lake Superior,* it was suggested by some that they might possibly have come from the limestone districts to the south and south-east ; such a supposition, however, would have been in direct opposition to what we know of the general course of the drift agencies. Rather than adopt such an opinion, I preferred to derive these limestone pebbles from some distant portion of the British territory, where similar \u2022From information derived from Mr. Ballenden, of the Hudson's Bay Company, we became aware, several years ago, of the occurrence of the Silurian and Devonian series, on the northern slope of the axis between Lake Superior and Hudson's Bay. These series are intersected in crossing from Michipicoten river to James' Bay, the southern arm of Hud son's Bay. Mr. Ballenden described the strata on the shores cf Lake Winnipeg, as con sisting of limestone, in nearly horizontal strata, filled with fossils. Within the last year, Sir John Richardson, in the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society, mentions that the Silurian series occur on both sides of the axis, in an undistur' d position, and continue to the Arctic Ocean. The fossils found in the superficial deposits along the shores of Lake Superior, are not exclusively confined to the Niagara limestone, but range from the Devonian to the Trenton limestone. Some of the cyathophylla are from the Devonian, while, at the mouth of Black river, in the south-west extremity of the lat' we have collected one or two trilobites, as old as the Hudson-river group. When we cor sider the relative positions of Lake Temiscomeng, and the south-western portion of Lake Superior, where also the fossils of the Niagara group occur in the superficial deposits, it would be unphilosophical to inler that they were derived from a single point ; for, if this were the case, the drift current by which their transport is supposed to have been effected, must have swept in a course a few degrees south of west, a course not coincident with the stri\u00e6 on the rocks. Since it is pretty certain that we have a belt of Silurian rocks on the north of the brim of Lake Superior, there is little difficulty in accounting for the presence of fossil.: in the transported materials. Those of the Niagara group are more abundant, for the reason that they are generally sili cified, whereas those of the Hudson-river group arc not, and therefore more liable \"to be ground up and destroyed. p_ & yy\\"], [593, "247 [4] limestones are said to occur along the north-western lakes and the Macken zie river ; although I could not but confess that their transportation from such a distance was rather uncommon. All the difficulties have since been removed by the recent discovery made by the Provincial Geologist of Canada, Mr. Logan, of an extensive deposit of white Niagara limestone on Lake Temiscomeng, fifty miles north of Georgian Bay ; and since the rock, according to Mr. Logan, presents the same lithological features which are exhibited by the fragments scattered throughout the drift and alluvium of Lake Superior, there can be hardly a doubt as to this being the source from whence the latter have been derived. This is the more satisfactory, as Lake Temiscomeng is situated to the north east of Lake Superior, in a direction, which, as has been shown in the pre vious pages, is also that to which most of the stri\u00e6 of this district seem to point, thus showing, that the two operations \u2014 the grooving of the rocks and the transportation of the materials \u2014 have taken place in the same direction from north-east to south-west."], [594, "[4] 248 CHAPTER XV.

Age. \u2014 Lacustrine in their Origin. \u2014 Denudation of the Drift. \u2014 The Period of its Denudation. Terraces of Mackinac. \u2014 In my last report,* I briefly alluded to the gravel terraces which skirt this island, as among its most remarkable fea tures. At that time, the age of the corresponding terraces of Lakes Huron and Erie had not been ascertained, nor was it known whether they were of marine or fresh-water origin. I therefore refrained from entering into any speculations as to their precise age, but merely stated that they were more recent than the drift, and ranked them among the alluvial deposits. Meanwhile, Mr. Whittlesey has succeeded in finding fresh-water shells in the clay and loam deposits of the south shore of Lake Erie, and was led to infer that they belonged to the age of those lacustrine deposits in the valley of the Rhine, known as loess, which are intermediate between the drift and recent alluvium. Although the terraces of Mackinac differ widely in composition from the loam, or loess, of Lakes Erie and Huron, yet, the fact that both are poste rior to the drift and occur at similar heights on the coast of the same lake, seems to warrant the conclusion that they may have been simultaneous. The next inquiry would be, how far their peculiarity of structure can be accounted for by their insulated and exposed position in the straits. This island, situated at their eastern entrance, is as interesting in a geological, as in a picturesque point of view. It rises to the height of three hundred and fifteen feet, and its base and precipitous cliffs, occasionally crowned with clumps of foliage, at once arrest the attention of the traveller, more espe cially since the whole western coast of Lake Huron is low and void of scenic interest. The sketch on the following page (Fig. 24) represents a distant view of the island, approaching from the eastward. Its main features, when seen from the wharf, at first appear exceedingly simple. A cliff of limestone, white and weather-beaten, with a narrow, alluvial plain skirting its base, is the first thing which commands attention ; but, when following along the gently curving bay, towards the Mission house, if the geologist happens to cast his eye upon the terrace which rises in the rear of the house, he will notice that the cliff is no longer composed of solid rock, but of loose mate rials consisting of limestone-gravel, with larger pebbles intermingled \u2014 dif fering in so marked a degree from all other detrital deposits seen along the shores of the upper lakes, that his curiosity is at once aroused. He would, * Keport Part I., p. 213."], [595, "249 [ 4 ] at first sight, be disposed to class it with alluvium, were it not for the height at which it occurs, namely, eighty feet. Fig. 24. Mackinac. 1. Lover's Leap. 2. Harbor. 3. Tillage. 4. Fort. 6. Signal. 6. Sugar Loaf. 7. Mission. 8. Robinson's Folly. These loose materials disappear, as soon as we reach the top of the ter race, being merely heaped up against the cliff, so as to form an external covering, and are also lost sight of in going southward towards the fort. If, from this point, we proceed towards the signal at the summit of the island, we find at first the surface of the plateau destitute of detrital mate rials, with the exception of a few isolated boulders. It is only when ap proaching the foot of the signal, that they reappear ; but essentially diffe rent in composition, being composed of rolled materials, as stated in a former report, characteristic of the true drift. It is evident to the observer that deposits so essentially different cannot belong to the same period. If, from the harbor, we follow the coast south-westwardly, towards the headland known as Lover's Leap, we meet with features still more inte resting. Instead of one terrace, we meet with a series of them, the relative position of which is indicated in the following topographical sketch : Fig. 25 Topographical Sketch of Mackinac. I. Lover's Leap, 2. Harbor, 3. Village, 4. Fort, 5. Signal, 6. Sugar Loaf, 7. Mission, 8. Robinson's Folly."], [596, "[4] 250 The terraces are most striking in the immediate vicinity of the promon tory, where, from their being crowded together in a narrow space, they appear like a gigantic stair-case. They are less distinct in the vicinity of the village, on account of their being farther apart, still there is no difficulty in tracing the principal levels, as will be seen by the sections below, (Figs. 26, 27.) The materials composing these terraces are limestone-gravel, with hardly any admixture of foreign rock ; which is the more remarkable, since there are many granite pebbles and boulders in the drift, at the summit of the island. In surveying the position and structure of these terraces, which contract near the head, and expand under the lee of the promontory, we become convinced that they were formed by a current setting from the south-west, which, after having passed the point, subsided in velocity and dropped the materials transported from the adjacent shores. The following sections (Figs. 26, 27), taken at two different places across them (a-6 and c-d, Fig. 25) exhibit the relative height and width of the terraces at these points : Fig. 26. Fig. 27. Fig. 26. Section along the line a b, in Fig. 25. Fig. 27. Section along the line c d, in Fig. 25. The first section was taken immediately east of the Lover's Leap, where the terraces are in close proximity. Starting from the beach, which, at the time of the measurement (June 22, 1849,) was five feet above the lake-level, we found the following order of succession : No. Width. Height. 1, A ten-ace 10 feet. 9.5 2.\" \u00ab 10 \" 22. 3.\" \u00ab more distinct 50 \u00ab 42. 4.\" \u00ab with a slope of 50\u00b0 55 \u00ab 105. 5. Summit of a limestone ridge 147. In the next section, the two upper terraces preserved the same level, but they are farther apart. The third terrace which, in Fig. 26, is only fifty feet wide, here assumes a width of three hundred and fifty, while the two lower are replaced by a succession of ridges, with double slopes, like recent beaches. There can be no doubt that this change is owing mainly to the configura tion of the coast. By referring to the diagram (Fig. 25), it will be seen that the cliff recedes, as we proceed N.E., and thus a wider space is allowed for the expansion of the materials ; and as the current abated in velocity, it lost its excavatory power, and hence the terraces expand in width, until, farther on, where the wearing ceased altogether, they disappear and are re placed by unaltered beaches. Along the south-western shore of the island, there are no indications"], [597, "251 [4] whatever of terraces ; but the northern shore is lined with a succession of beaches, not unlike those before described, except that they extend over a wider area. Along the road leading to the British landing, they occupy a space not less than three-fourths of a mile in width, extending nearly to the farm-house, where the boulders reappear. There is here a remarkable ridge of large limestone pebbles, which appears to correspond with the highest terrace on the opposite side of the island, and to mark the limit between the drift and the ancient beaches. The exact level at which the latter disappear on the north side of the island was not determined with precision, but was estimated at seventy or eighty feet. As will be seen by the following diagram, which represents a section of the island of Mackinac, there is Fig. 28. Section of the Island of Mackinac. a most striking contrast between the two shores. On the one side, we have distinct terraces with stair-like slopes, and on the other a series of beaches with gentle slopes; and yet the materials of both are identical. This difference is chiefly owing to the form of the coast. On the southern side, where the space is narrow and the slope abrupt, there was a wearing off of the beach after the upheaval of the land. These terraces are due to successive upheavals, and the base of each marks the limit of the periods ot repose. On the northern side, the coast is low, presenting a long and gen tle slope. There was, therefore, room enough for the formation of beaches at each change of level, which, after having been raised above the reach of the waves, remained unaltered. Hence, a succession of uniform beaches is produced on those parts of the island exempt from the wearing action of currents, but those portions exposed to this action are characterized by ter races. These beaches gradually decrease, as traced from the British landing, and, after having turned the north-east corner of the island, entirely disappear \u2014 the shore beino- ao-ain lined with high limestone cliffs, which extend uninter ruptedly to the eastern promontory known as Robinson's Folly. Yet this portion' of the island is not entirely destitute of detrital deposits, for there is to be seen, a short distance beyond the Arched Rock, a terrace with steep slopes, consisting of limestone pebbles, and rising to the height of about twenty feet ; its top and sides are overgrown with lar^e trees, showing that it is not of very recent origin. Like the terraces at Lover's Leap, it abuts"], [598, "[4] 252 against a promontory ; and as it does not extend beyond, it is evident that its formation is due to the shelter afforded by it ; the cave in the rear causing an eddy, in which the currents deposited a part of their materials. This is farther confirmed by the fact that there is a recent beach, of con siderable extent, abutting against the promontory, and separated from the terrace by a small marsh. The most important feature, however, is the fact that both beach and terraces occur on the north-west side of the promontory, thus showing con clusively that they were formed in the lee of the east wind ; whereas the terraces of Lover's Leap, as well as the beaches on the north side, near the British landing, were evidently in the lee of the south wind. This is, in itself, sufficient evidence that the gravel terraces, like the actual beaches, were accumulated under the influence of local causes, at a time when the topographical features of the region, and the distribution of the winds, must have been very similar to what they now are. It will not be uninteresting to compare these observations with similar ones made by Sir R. Murchison on the island of Gothland, in the Baltic :* \" In many ancient bays (of Gothland), where the coasts do not present bluff-cliffs washed by the Baltic, like Hog-Klint, on the east coast, and Mount Hoburg on the south, terraces of water-worn and flattened shingle are exhibited at heights of twenty or thirty feet above each other, of which four or five may, in some places, be counted, between a low interior (or an cient) cliff or scar of limestone and the present sea, to which there is usually a long slope from the lowest of these terraces. The inland cliffs or scars present, in many places, the aspect of having been washed by the waves, and the different terraces of shingle, (each having a level surface, and each exactly like that which the sea washes at its present level) bespeak as many distinct upheavals, and are evidently quite unlike anything which could have resulted from the gradual upraising of the island. As the nature and rela tive position of numerous raised sea-beaches, or shingle banks, in different parts of Norway and Sweden, lead to the same conclusion ; the bearing of this view upon our subject, consists, not merely in establishing a submarine condition of things, totally irreconcilable with the application of former glaciers to such tracts, but is, as will be seen, of some theoretical value in accounting for the motive power of those waves of translation, to which I have elsewhere referred, and which, independent of all glacial action, may, by sudden upcasts, have produced the violent transport, and consequent rounding and rolling onwards of much gravel and detritus. \" Now it is important to observe, that these terraces in Gothland, simply consist of the limestone locally rolled and flattened into shingle, such as is actually formed on the sea-beach ; and it is only after having passed over them, and when we have reached to the height of a hundred feet more, that we meet with the \"Osar\" drift of foreign, coarser boulders, mixed with limestone debris, and surmounted here and there by great angular blocks. So striking is the resemblance between these two localities, that we need only substitute the island of Mackinac for that of Gothland, to have a true picture of the relation between the drift and the gravel terraces. It is true, the shingle beaches of Gothland do not attain so high a level as those of Mackinac ; but the height of thirty feet is sufficient to warrant the conclu sion that they have not been heaped up by the mere action of the waves \u2022 Quarterly Journal of Lend. Geol. Society, 1846, p. 360"], [599, "253 [4] and surf; but that they must have undergone an upheaval since their deposition, which brings them into the same category with the terraces of Mackinac. Terraces, in every respect similar to those of Mackinac, occur on the neighboring coasts and islands. On Round island they attain an elevation of forty-six feet, by the south shore, between the two hooks. On the west coast, Mr. Whittlesey found them at the height of eighty feet. I noticed that the gravel, although composed of the same limestone as that at Macki nac, was much finer, the pebbles rarely exceeding a chestnut in size. A similar terrace, but of less height, measuring some twenty feet, may be seen at the foot of Rabbit mountain, on the north coast of Lake Michigan. At Pointe St. Ignace,* it rises to a greater height, connecting, as it were the various promontories of limestone, which stand out like bastions in a huge wall. The terraces are still more remarkable in the vicinity of Gros Cap, the uppermost attaining an elevation of one hundred and thirty feet. Two miles east of the promontory, I noticed one at the height of eighty five feet. It can be safely inferred from the terraces of Gros Cap, as well as those of Mackinac, that the upheaval took place at successive intervals, and that the waters were stationary for some time at the foot of each. It will, per haps, be possible, at some future day, to trace these various levels around the islands, and thus to ascertain whether or not the upheaval has been uni form throughout the whole range. Age of these. Terraces. \u2014 That the terraces of Mackinac and the adjacent shores are more recent than the drift, needs no farther demonstration, since the latter, as was shown previously, is only found at higher levels, to which the terraces do not reach. Nor can they be mere alluvial beaches, for they occur at too great heights to be due to the mere fluctuations of the lake level. To account for their actual position, we are compelled to assume a rising of the land at successive epochs. Now a change of one hundred and five feet, which would be required to account for the highest of the terraces at the Lover's Leap, supposes such a change in the distribution of land and water, and such a change in the aspect of the surrounding country, that it is, in itself, a sufficient reason for separating the terraces from the beaches, the latter being decidedly alluvial. On the other hand, the position and distribution of the terraces are not without some importance, in reference to their age. We have found them, for the most part, occurring on the east side of the island, and especially under the lee of the promonotory of Lover's Leap, where they are shel tered from the south-west winds and currents ; whereas none are sound to the west. The inference, therefore, is plain that the materials must have been carried from south to north, or in a direction opposite to that of the drift ; and this may be considered as another proof that the deposits have nothing in common. If we now consider the geographical position of the island, it can hardly be expected that a sheet of water with the current coming from the south west, could have been anything else than an inland sea. No fossil remains have, as yet, been found among the terraces to throw light upon their origin, and it is not probable, from their structure, that they will yield any. \u2666 The reader must not confound St. Ignace and Gros Cap of Lake Michigan with those of Lake Superior."], [600, "[4] 254 The question as to their being of marine, fresh water, or brackish origin, cannot be decided by the evidence of fossil contents, and we are compelled to resort to such evidence as is afforded by other ancient terraces and beaches, of the adjacent lakes. Those of Lake Erie and Huron, as before stated, have been ascertained to be of lacustrine origin. From their extent and position, there can be no doubt that they are at least as ancient as those of Mackinac; and, if the changes of level by which they were brouo-ht into their present position were all uniform, the surface of this ancient lake must have reached as high as the uppermost terrace of the island. There is, therefore, no necessity of resorting to local changes and disturbances, in order to account for the lacustrine origin of these terraces ; and, since we have in the terrace of Cleveland direct evidence of the exist ence of such an extensive fresh-water basin, posterior to the great body of the drift and previous to the alluvium, there seems to be some reason for referring the terraces of Mackinac to the same epoch : \u2014 at any rate, they cannot be more ancient. There are, however, some difficulties in the way, which I feel it neces sary, in all candor, to state. I mean the absence of similar terraces far ther west, along the north shore of Lake Michigan and Green Bay. It has been shown, in the preceding chapter, that at Pine river, the Manistee and Menomonee, the true drift may be found a short distance from the coast, and at no considerable height above the lake-level, sometimes as low, even, as twenty feet. Now, it is evident that, if the lake ever reached, in these places, the same height as at Mackinac, we should find there similar ter races above the drift. The difficulty might, however, be met by supposing that the upheaval which raised the terraces of Mackinac to their actual height, did not operate to the same extent west of the island. At any rate, this circumstance is, in itself, a proof that the change could not have been brought about by a mere lowering of the water ; but that they must, at all events, be referred to a gradual, but unequal rise in the land. As in many other instances, there appears to be, on the island, something like a gradual transition from the upper terraces to the highest beaches. It would be difficult to trace the line of demarcation between the two ; but we need only consider the position of the latter, in such places where there can be no doubt as to their having been merely the result of the lake action within historical times, to be convinced that they nowhere exceed eighteen or twenty feet. It seems, therefore, not unreasonable to refer to an earlier period, all such terraces and deposits of the Island of Mackinac, as occur above that level ; whereas, those which are below it must be referred to the recent period. With regard to the latter, the reader is referred to the latter part of the succeeding chapter, by Mr. Whittlesey, on the ancient and present beaches of Lake Michigan. DENUDATION. It has been shown, in a previous report, that the position of the drift on the island of Mackinac is such, that it cannot be supposed to have been de posited originally in this manner, it being in the nature of the drift deposits in general, to sill up the depressions and spread over the plains, rather than to occupy the summits. I was thus led to the conclusion that the absence of th\u00ab drift, on the lower portions of the island, was owing to a denudation"], [601, "255 jr 4 -j caused, probably, by violent currents along the main channels ; since a simi- lar denudation is observed, both along the straits of Mackinac and the valley of the St. Marys' river, where the banks, on either side, for some distance, are destitute of drift. The question arises, at what epoch did this denudation take place ? The terraces at Mackinac afford us the means of solving this problem, at least in part, as far as the island and neighboring shores are concerned. A careful examination of the terraces has shown, tnat they all rest immediately on the subjacent rocks, there being, nowhere, any trace of drift beneath them. The inference, therefore, is, that the drift ?must have been removed from the surface and from the slopes of the island, previously to the formation of the terraces. As to the nature of these de- nudating currents, we are inclined to the belief that they were chiefly owing to the retreat of the waters of the drift epoch, when the continent, after having been subsiding for a long period, began again gradually to rise. The beginning of this rising, which might thus be considered as coincident with the beginning of the denudation, would then represent the true limit between the drift epoch and the highest terraces of Mackinac."], [602, "[4] 256 CHAPTER XVI.

It has been repeatedly stated, in the preceding chapters, that, while the interior of the upper peninsula of Michigan is covered with extensive drift deposits, the immediate shores of Lake Superior, where they are suffi ciently low, appear to be lined with deposits belonging to the recent epoch : to wit \u2014 the Alluvium. Under this head I shall include the recent beaches, whether of pebbles or sand ; the marshes and flats ; those heaps of blown sand, known as dunes, or downs ; and, finally, those beaches and terraces which seem to indicate a higher level in the waters of the lakes at some former period. Sa?id Beaches. \u2014 The voyageur, who coasts along the northern shore of Lake Michigan, cannot fail to notice those deposits of fine, white sand which line the shore, sometimes for a long distance, and form the bottoms of nearly all the bays and coves. This sand, when examined microscopi cally, is found to be composed of minute grains of nearly pure white quartz. Similar sand beaches have been noticed as occurring in many places along the shores of Lake Superior. They assume, however, a special interest in reference to Lake Michigan, for the reason that the surrounding country is exclusively calcareous. The question, therefore, naturally arises in the mind of every geologist, as to the source from which this silicious sand was derived. There might be some difficulty in answering it, if .we had simply explored the coast; but, knowing that the drift exists almost everywhere in the interior, and that, though lss homo geneous in structure, it is yet composed of a large admixture of sand and gravel, we are not at a loss to assign its origin to this source. Every stream that flows down from the wide drift-covered districts in the interior, carries with it a quantity of sand and gravel, which, when brought wthin the influence of the waves, becomes thoroughly assorted ; the calcareous particles are probably dissolved, while the silicious grains are distributed according to their size and specific gravity ; and, when thrown upon the beach, occasion those accumulations of white, homogeneous, quartzose sand which are seen so generally lining the coast. Pebble Beaches. \u2014 The occurrence of these is to be expected on all rock bound shores. I mention them here in consequence of their extraordinary"], [603, "257 [ 4 ] extent along the shores of some of the islands at the entrance to Green Bay. The pebbles are chiefly limestone, varying in size from that of a chestnut to that cf a melon ; so few, indeed, are the specimens of igneous, or metamorphic rocks, that I have often walked for hours along the beach without observing their presence. On 'some of the islands they are piled up, like an immense wall, from six to eight feet in height. Extensive pebble beaches also occur on the southern shore ..of Lake Su perior, especially along that extended reach of coast to the east of Grand Sable. The pebbles here are almost exclusively granitic and entirely foreigu to the rock in place (Potsdam sandstone). For a distance of several miles east and west of Two-hearted river, the shore is lined with an uninterrupted beach of pebbles of rather uniform size, rarely exceeding that of an apple. This is the more extraordinary, as the only deposit vi.-ible in the rear of the beach is fine drift-sand. Another similar pebble beach is seen lining the coast for a long distance west of White-fish Point. Occasionally, however, the pebbles are replaced by a homogeneous sand beach. The beaches along Keweenaw Point consist for the most part of trappean pebbles of large si-re, with an occasional admixture of granite ; and this remark is applicable to those in the vicinity of the Porcupine mountains and on Isle Royale. They have been derived, in the main, from the destruction of the trappean conglomerate, and of the associated igneous rocks, while the granitic pebbles have been transported by drift agencies ; where long reaches of sandstone occur along the coast, few pebble beaches are observed. In the vicinity of Granite Point and Middle island, granite and greenstone pebbles greatly preponderate. As a general rule, the character of the beaches is determined by the character of the neighboring rocks; but there are many phenomena which can be explained only after a close and elabo rate study of the outline of the shore, the depth of the water, and the na ture and for.^e of the current. Such knowledge could not be acquired in a hurried coasting expedition, in which investigations of this nature were us subordinate interest. Alluvial Marshes. \u2014 I place under this head those extensive accumula- tions of alluvial matter which line the coast uninterruptedly, for a great distance, and which, i a consequence of their low level, are generally swampy. A striking instance of this character occurs along the western coast of Green Bay, which fix- a distance of more than thirty miles, to wit, \u2014 from the mouth of the Menomonee to that of the Fox river, \u2014 is lined with a continuous belt of low swampy ground, from a few rods to half a mile in width. This marsh yields a luxuriant crop of wild hay, sufficient to supply numerous herds. The soil consists of the same fine silicious sand, before described as occurring on the beaches, and its marshy character results from its low position. The inquiry naturally suggests itself, why this marshy belt should be confined to this particular locality, there being nothing like it on the easlern coast of Green Bay, or the northern coast of Lake Michi- gan. I cannot but think that, in this case, it is owing to the sheltered position of the coast and its nearly uniform level, resulting from the hori zontally of the strata, which allow the particles of sand brought down by the rivers to accumulate and spread in regular layers, without being much disturbed by westerly gales.* * This is also the origin of many marshes of less extent along the shores of Lake Superior. Ex.\u2014 9"], [604, "[ 4 ] 258 Flats.\u2014 There may be seen on the same western coast of Green Bay extensive flats, which are simply the continuation under water of the allu- vial sand, forming the soil of the marshes. Indeed, so gradual is the transi- tion, that it is difficult to draw the line of separation between them. The origin of these flats can be referred, with still greater certainty than that of the alluvial marshes, to the action of rivers, from the circumstance that they are more extensive in the vicinity of their embouchures. Thus, at the mouth of the Peshetigo river of Green Bay, the flats are not only very wide, but a bar extends for a long distance into the bay. The fact that the silicious sand deposits can be traced back to the agency of rivers is sufficient proof that they are nothing more than the detritus of the drift \u2014 the analogues, though on a small scale, of the flats, bars, and., sand beaches, now forming on the Atlantic coast. Subaqueous Ridges. \u2014 An example of this character occurs on the north- ern shore of Lake Michigan, not far from the Fish station of Bark Point (Pointe aux Ecorces), under the lee of a promontory, designated on the map as Point Patterson. Here, the shore, after running clue east and west for some distance, bends abruptly to the north-east. The voyageur coming from the west, after having passed Point Patterson, is struck by the appear- ance of several bands of shallow water, indicated by a yellowish tint. These bands, which appear to start from the extremity of the point, are caused by subaqueous ridges, which spread, fan-like, to the distance of nearly half a mile to the east, being from three to ten yards wide, and from five to ten feet above the general bed of the lake, at this point. They are not com- posed, like the flats, of fine sand, but of white limestone pebbles, derived from the adjacent ledges, with an admixture of granitic pebbles, some of which are a foot in diameter. It is difficult to conceive of currents suffi- ciently powerful to transport and arrange such heavy materials, and yet we know of no other means by which this aggregation could have been accom plished. These subaqueous ridges afford, on a small scale, an interesting illustra- tion of the formation of similar ridges now above water. If the north coast of Lake Michigan were to be raised only twenty feet, such a rise would lay dry a wide belt of almost level ground, on which these ridges would appear conspicuously, not unlike those which occur on the south shores of Lakes Erie and Ontario, and thus confirm the views of Mr. Whittlesey, that most of these ridges are not ancient beaches, but have been formed, under water, by the action of currents.* Hooks, or Spits. \u2014 There are to be seen along the lake-shores, as well as along the sea-shores, belts of loose materials, either sand or gravel, which extend into the water beyond the rocky boundaries, and form low barren spits, or points. These spits are frequently curved at their extremities, and have therefore received the name of hooks. A striking instance of this character may be seen at the south-western extremity of Round island, op- j posite Mackinac, which presents, as ascertained by measurement, the fol- lowing form (Fig. 29) : * I have elsewhere expressed the opinion that the pebble and sand ridges of the prairies of Illinois have originated in like manner, or that they are (like the so-called Indian ridges of New England, at Andover, Massachusetts, and in Maine, where they are provincially termed horse-backs) the analogues of the Swedish osars."], [605, "259 [4] Fig. 29. Hook at Round Island. A similar hook was measured on one of the Summer islands, in the vici nity of Death's door (Porte des morts). I found it a general rule that, at the extremity of the spit, where it assumed the form of a hook, the con vexity was in the direction of the prevailing winds. The nature of the materials has but little influence on the formation of the hooks. Thus, where the beaches are composed of limestone pebbles, the hooks partake of this character, and where beaches are composed of sand, the hooks consist of the same material. I have noticed, however, that where the hooks are made up of shingle, the smaller pebbles occupy the extremity. The hooks combine, in various ways, with the more extensive alluvial deposits, and, in many instances, it is difficult to draw the line of separa tion between them. As an instance, I would mention White-fish Point on Lake Superior. Not only is its extremity terminated by a regular hook, which stretches eastward, but the whole area, extensive as it is in its struc tural relations, belongs to the hook formation. It will be seen, by inspect ing the map, that it is situated at the extremity of a long and almost straight coast, succeeded by a wide bay known as Tequamenon. Two causes have probably combined to produce this hook. The pre vailing current of the lake strikes the Canada shore \u2014 which consists of firm igneous and metamorphic rocks, opposing an effectual barrier to the encroachments of the lake \u2014 and is thence deflected southward into the bay, whose margin is lined with less coherent sandstone. The tendency of this current would be to wear away the hook on the eastern side ; but the loss is repaired by the prevailing winds which sweep from the north-west, accumulating detrital materials on the western side of the hook. They may, therefore, be regarded as compensating forces, the one counteracting the effects of the other, and thus preserving the outlines of the point almost unimpaired from year to year. Nowhere did I see the hook-form so well represented as at Grand Marais harbor, east of the Pictured Rocks. The projecting spit (Fig. 30) at its entrance presents the following outline, platted from the measurements of Mr. Whitney : Fig. 30. Hook at the entrance to Grand Marais Harbor."], [606, "260 im It is impossible to look at this little hook, without being struck with its resemblance to some of those on the oceanic border, \u2014 for instance, that of Cape Cod. Not only is it curved in the same manner, at its extremity; hut, inside of the outer hook, there is a second and smaller one, which seems a miniature of the first. This is the case with Cape Cod ; the inner hook enclosing the Bay of Provincetown. Thus, the same causes which construct the alluvial deposits on the Atlantic coasf operate, though on a less extended scale, to build up the spits of our inland lakes. Similar hooks occur along the shores of the lower lakes, Ontario and Erie. As a remarkable instance, I would mention Sandy Point on the British side of Lake Erie, and the hooks which enclose the harbor of Erie on the American side. On Lake Ontario, the most remarkable hook is that which shelters the harbor of Toronto. Hooks, like these, are of the highest importance, being sometimes the only natural harbors along low flat coasts. Even, the smaller hooks are not without interest, for they often, on the upper lakes, affoid a welcome shelter to the coasting-boats. River-belts. \u2014 It is not unfrequent for a river, before its dehouchure into the lake, to pursue for some distance a course parallel to the shore. Their deflection is caused by an accumulation of sand, or gravel, very similar to that of the hooks in composition, and deposited by the same causes. These deposits, generally in the form of a narrow spit, are ele vated but slightly above the water. I shall designate these as river-belts, in order to distinguish them from the immersed ridges, known as bars, which are formed across the mouths of rivers. As might be expected, the bars are, in many cases, but a continuation beneath the water, of the belts. Sometimes, when the current is not strong enough to keep an open pas sage and the mouth of the river becomes silted up, the bar is transformed into a belt and the water percolates through the sand and pebbles, and thus gains access to the lake. Numerous instances of this kind have been observed on the south shore of Lake Superior, and on those of Isle Royale. During a freshet, the water cuts through the belt in a direct line, but as it subsides, the channel is again destroyed, or deflected for a long distance, parallel with the coast. Belts and bars are to be found only where the shores are flat; but they are wanting where the coast is bold and the water deep. As exam ples of the former, on the northern shore of lake Michigan, I would mention a small river near Biddle's Point, and another near Pointe aux Chenes, and the Menomonee and Peshetigo rivers. They are still more conspicuous on the south shore of Lake Superior ; as examples may be cited the mouths of the Ontonagon, of the Traine, and of the Two hearted rivers, but especially that of the Chocolate river, which is repre sented in the following sketch (Fig. 31), in which the proportions are correctly represented : Fig. 81. Belt of Chocolate River. D. T. Drist-ten-ace. H. Hook. D. Dune. M. Marsh, It. River."], [607, "261 [4] The belt extends from west to east, and is composed of a fine yellowish sand, identical with that of the beach westward, but different from that of the drift-terrace which lines the river on its right bank. As a peculiar feature of this belt, I would mention that it is covered towards its origin witha ridge of dunes, thus showing that, however recent the belt may be, the dunes are still more so. The recent origin of the dunes is confirmed by the fact that they are found embedding half-decayed elders, which, being particularly fond of a wet soil, could never have grown on this spot, under the present conditions. The most remarkable of all the belts of Lake Superior is that at the mouth of the St. Louis river, the extent of which may be seen by inspect ing Bayfield's chart. It is of such magnitude that it can be compared only to similar phenomena on the ocean shore. Occurring, however, as it does, within another geological district, and not having given it a personal examination, I must pass it by without farther comment. If it were asked to what extent a river may be deflected from its natural course by the increase of its belt, we might refer to many along the southern coast for an answer. The Carp river is a marked example. The present embouchure is but little deflected from the straight course ; but there is to be seen at the left, an ancient channel through which it formerly flowed. It would appear that many of these rivers, after flowing for some distance in a direction parallel to the coast, encroach gradually upon the belt, until it can no longer resist the pressure of the current, when it gives way and allows the waters to flow directly into the lake. By and bye, the beach sand accumulates outside of the river, and the latter again begins to be deflected. Similar changes are often effected during a gale of long continu ance. The mouths of many of the rivers are changed to an opposite direc tion, and the old belts are destroyed and new ones formed. The belts assume a uniform direction, where the winds prevail from a certain quarter. On the north shore of Lake Michigan, and on the south shore of Lake Superior, they commonly run from west to east ; but on the north shore of the latter lake, I am informed, their general direction is from east to west. Bars. \u2014 It need hardly be stated that the bars are only modifications of the river-belts, and that they are formed on the same principle; in other words, they are merely the continuation of the belts under water. There is hardly a river along the flat portions of the shores of Lake Superior, or Lake Michigan, where this continuity is not observed. Unless the current be strong enough to keep an open channel, these bars become like those of the ocean, a serious impediment to navigation. This is the case with regard to the Menomonee; the bar cannot be passed by steamers, or even schooners, otherwise the river would be navigable to the first rapids. The mouth of the Peshetigo \u2014 a very considerable stream south-west of the Menomonee, \u2014 is hardly accessible to a coasting-boat. Origin of Hooks and Belts. \u2014 Hooks and belts are due to a common origin, and hence they present a similarity of features. Both are the result of an eddy, or a diminished velocity in the current. It is an admitted prin ciple of hydrography that any current, holding sand or other materials in suspension, will drop a portion of its freight whenever its velocity is dimi nished. When, during a gale, the waters loaded with sand, after rushing around a point, pass into a sheltered bay, they immediately drop a portion"], [608, "[ 4 ] 262 of the materials held in suspension. A deposit, thus commenced, goes on increasing during every gale ; but, at the same time, a current, which is no longer kept in a steady direction by the resistance of the shore, will be de flected towards the bay, and the deposit will consequently assume an arched form. The hooks, occurring at the outlet of a river, or where it assumes a lake-like expansion, or where it bends abruptly, are the result of the same principle. The hooks of islands, like those of the main shore, occur in the direction of the prevailing winds. Thus, for example, on the islands near Death's door (Porte des morts), the sheltered, or lee side, will be to the S.E. ; the waters rushing from the N.W. will glide on both sides along their shores, until they meet at the opposite extremity, with a relative eddy, which causes them to deposit a portion of their freight in a similar manner as in the sheltered bays and coves of the main shore. The degree of cur vature in the island hooks depends chiefly on the comparative inequality of the currents on either side. If the island is so situated as to allow the cur rent to reach the lee, or sheltered coast, only on one side, the curvature Mill be great ; but, if the currents reach the lee of the island with equal force from either side, there will be no curvature ; \u2014 on the same principle that the sand, which accumulates on the lee-side of the pier of a bridge, is arranged in a straight line. As a whole, the island hooks are less curved than those of the main land. That deposits of a similar kind should occur at the mouths of rivers is but natural, if we consider that river-belts are also the result of a relative eddy. If a current, either constant or remittent, sets along a shore, it will continue to flow with equal strength as long as there is no obstacle interposed ; but, when it meets in its course the current of a river debouching at right angles, the latter will cause the former to abate in velocity, and thus a state of comparative quiet is produced, in consequence of which, a portion of the materials are thrown down at the point of con fluence \u2014 the river here acting the same part as a bay in the former instance. The width, however, of a river-belt is not generally greater than is required for the discharge of the waters, and hence it follows, that the belt cannot encroach on the river ; therefore, instead of bending inward, it increases in a straight line, parallel with the beach. As to the origin of the materials of belts, it will be found that they con sist of sand and pebbles, similar to those of the neighboring beach ; thus showing that they were heaped up from without and not from within. This is especially striking in places where the materials of the river differ from those of the beaches. Occasionally, we may find the inner margin of the belt partly composed of river materials, but they are seldom mingled with those of the outer margin. It follows, from the foregoing remarks, that belts, as well as hooks, must go on increasing beneath the water for sometime before they appear at the surface ; and, indeed, it is not unfrequent to see the subaqueous portions extending for some distance beyond the subaerial ones, \u2014 the former being indicated by the different hues of the water. These hooks and belts afford us the most simple and natural explanation of the formation of bars, which are nothing but immersed belts. The occurrence, to such an extent, of hooks, belts, and bars, on the borders of our lakes, cannot but have some bearing on the views entertained as to their origin along the shores of the ocean, where they are developed on a larger scale. Their formation has been mainly ascribed to the action of the tidal currents ; but it is sufficient to have shown that they are phe-"], [609, "263 [ 4 ] nomena of common occurrepce along the lake-shores to prove that tidal ac tion is not necessary for their formation, although there can be no doubt that, when there is a tidal current, it must play an important part, in con junction with other causes. Dunes. \u2014 Under the name of dunes, or downs, we designate those irregu lar heaps of fine sand which are accumulated by the winds on certain shores. They are generally composed of fine silicious sand, without any stratification. Their most conspicuous feature, however, is their irregular outline, which is so striking that it cannot fail to attract the notice even of those who are not particularly engaged in geological inquiries. Not only are the hillocks of very irregular size and height, but they are often shaped in the most fantastic manner ; some being very steep, others with a .gentle slope, and others with rounded outlines. They have not improperly been compared to oceanic waves suddenly solidified. Dunes are especially conspicuous on the oceanic shores ; and there are countries in which they are of paramount importance, both in a geographi cal and economical point of view. Holland owes its prosperity chiefly to the shelter which the dunes afford to its navigation, by forming a natural and most valuable barrier against the invasion of the sea ; whereas, in other countries, they are dreaded on account of their encroachment upon culti vated and fertile soil ; as, for instance, on the coast of Suffolk, in England, and in Gascony, France.* It appears that, in some countries, they advance with great regularity, so much so that they have been represented as natu ral chronometers, the rate of their advancement affording a means of calcu lating approximately the epoch when they first began to accumulate. Although the dunes, as a whole, are less frequent on this side of the At lantic than on the other, yet there are some striking instances of their oc currence on the shores of New England, especially at Cape Cod, where they have been described by Professor Hitchcock. There, too, we may witness considerable changes from year to year, in their outlines. Nay, the movements of the blown sand have been deemed serious enough to attract the attention of the government, and it has been attempted to devise means to prevent the harbor of Provincetown from being eventually filled up. This object has been partially attained by planting beach-grass along the shore, whereby the single grains of sand are arrested in their course, and the onward progress of the dune stopped. The dunes of the upper lakes are of peculiar interest, affording, to my knowledge, the only examples of their occurrence on the borders of an in land sheet of water. Nor are they in any way inferior in height to those of the ocean shore. The average height of the latter is indicated, by M. Elie de Beaumont, at from twenty to sixty feet ; and it is only in extraor dinary cases that they rise to the height of one, two or three hundred feet. Those of Cape Cod do not exceed eighty feet, although they have been des cribed as beino- higher ; whereas, it is reported that some of the dunes, on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, attain a height of three hundred feet.t One of the hills, which from its striking appearance is called the Sleeping Bear, is said to be nothing but a huge dune. * There are, in both countries, instances on record where whole villages have been in vaded by the dunes and converted into deserts. tThe hills called Grand Sable, east of the Pictured Rocks, on Lake Superior, are some times ranked among the most remarkable instances of dunes ; but I have shown in my for mer report that they belong to the drift formation."], [610, "[ 4 ] 264 Those of the north shore of Lake Michigan, although not quite as high, are nevertheless very striking. The most remarkable for size, or extent, occur at Pointe aux Chenes, a locality some twenty miles west of Mackinac. The shore rises suddenly to the west of the point, in hills which, from their singular shape and bare surface, would be recognized at once, even from a distance, as dunes. They are composed of a fine quartzose sand, with a lit tle admixture of colored grains, which impart to the whole a yellowish tint. Having measured several of the hills with my pocket-level, I found them to average, near the point, from eighty to one hundred feet in height. The highest, however, at a distance of half a mile from the point, I found to be one hundred and twelve feet,* extending, uninterruptedly to the west, a distance of some six miles ; but at the same time decreasing in height, until they are reduced to hillocks, not exceeding twenty-five feet. I noticed, besides, that they became more and more covered with vegeta tion towards the west, this being without doubt the most ancient portion. There are nowhere any traces of stratification to be seen in them ; nor could I detect a single pebble in the mass, except some few scattered ones in the depressions between the hillocks, where they were thrown up by the waves, in severe gales, as is also the case on Cape Cod. In following the summit of the upper dune-ridge at Pointe aux Chenes, I noticed that the back slope was very steep, and at the same time very con stant. I found its inclination to be 32\u00b0; this being, without doubt, the greatest natural slope which this kind of loose sand is capable of assuming, when sheltered from the winds. Whenever the dunes exhibit some regularity, or are so situated as to form a succession of ridges perpendicular to the coast, this greater steepness of one slope is always noticeable. Moreover, it is invariably found that the gentle and long slope is towards the windward side, and the steep side to the lee. This feature is especially striking near the western extremity of the dune-ridge of Point aux Chenes. The same feature is repeated in several places along Lake Superior. As a peculiarity of the dunes, in both places, I would mention that they are often covered with trees of considerable size, such as, to my knowledge, do not occur on any of the oceanic dunes. One white pine, which I meas ured near the top of one of the highest ridges of Pointe aux Chenes, was found to be eight feet m circumference ; thus showing that the dune has, at least, remained unchanged in this spot, for some length of time. The trees unquestionably act as barriers to prevent the sand from spreading further in land ; and there is but little doubt that if they were cut down, the scanty vegetation which covers the summit and the back of the dune-ridge, would prove insufficient to resist the action of the winds. The sand would be laid bare, and the whole range of dunes would spread inland, as it is known to do in several parts of Europe. A peculiarity of this character was observed on the summit of the country back of the Grand Sable of Lake Superior. Here, numerous clumps of trees rise up like islands, in a wide waste of shifting sands, and struggle to gain a precarious support. Next to the dunes of Pointe aux Chenes, the most remarkable within the upper peninsula of Michigan are those of White-fish Point, on Lake Supe rior, an outline of which is given in the following sketch by Mr. Foster (Fig- 32)."], [611, "[4] 965 Fig. 82. Sand-dunes at White-fish Point. Although very conspicuous when seen from a distance, the dunes of White-fish Point are, nevertheless, smaller than those of Lake Michigan. The most elevated hills do not attain the height of the light-house, which is built among them, and which is seventy-five feet high. As to their extent, it is doubtful whether they cover more than a square-mile ; yet their posi tion in front of the projecting promontory is such, that they necessarily attract the notice of all travellers on Lake\" Superior ; and hence their great celebrity. An interesting instance of the instability of the dunes is afforded at the western extremity of White-fish Point, as seen by the following sketch (Fig. 33). Fig. 33. Section of a Dune at White-fish Point. A dune (2) some twenty-five or thirty feet high, is seen rising near the shore ; and between it and the gravel beach (1) are seen several dead pine trees, buried partly in the sand of the dunes. Now, it is hardly prob- able that the shore was as barren as it is now, when the trees first grew in that place. Being apparently of the same kind as those in the rear of the dune, which are rooted in the alluvial soil of the point, it is but natural to suppose that they belong to a similar soil, and attained their full size before the dune was formed. Thus it would follow that the dune has taken pos- session of the soil subsequently to the growth of the pines, which have , probably been killed by its encroachment. A similar instance of the recent increase of dunes has been previously mentioned as occurring near the mouth of Traine river, where young elders may actually be seen buried to the limbs in the sand of the dunes ; and there is hardly any doubt that, like those of White-fish Point, they will die, if the sand is not removed. Dunes also occur, to some extent, along the shore of Keweenaw Point, west of Eagle Harbor. They here line the coast for a considerable dis tance, but do not exceed twenty-five or thirty feet in height. The mouth of Eagle river is likewise lined with a succession of dune"], [612, "to 266 ridges ; the highest of which, and also the most distant from the beach, t found, by measurement with a pocket-level, to be forty-seven feet. Like those of Pointe aux Chenes, they are covered with a scanty vegetation. Dunes of less extent occur at the mouth of several rivers, both on Lake Superior and Lake Michigan. On the former, I would mention those of Chocolate and Traine rivers, which are as much as thirty-six feet high ; on the latter, those at the mouths of the Manistee and Menomonee, along the western shore of Green bay. More extensive dunes occur, I am told, on the north shore of Lake Erie, on that extensive spit or hook called Long Point, where they appear, from a distance at sea, as a chain of very singu lar hills. , Mr. Murray mentions, also, dunes in several places along the east shore of Lake Huron. At Port Franck they rise to the height of one hundred feet and more. The occurrence of dunes, more frequently at the mouths of rivers than elsewhere, is probably to be accounted for by the fact that the beaches are here more extensive, and offer a greater supply of sand. Origin of the Dunes. \u2014 It need hardly be stated that _ the dunes. are nothing else than the sand of the beaches, raised by the winds when dry, and heaped up in these irregular hillocks. This process may be witnessed on every sand beach where the wind has free access ; besides, we need only compare a handful of the dune sand with the sand of the beach, where it is homogeneous, to be convinced that the two are identical. The dunes which we have been describing, therefore, enable us to correct an erroneous impression as to their mode of formation. The circumstance that the most celebrated among the oceanic dunes, those of Holland in Europe, and of Cape Cod in this country, occur on coasts where there is a considerable rise and fall of the tide, led to the inference that tides were necessary to their formation ; it being known that the sand of the beach frequently becomes sufficiently dried, during the ebb, to be carried off by the winds. The above mentioned instances of dunes on the shores of the upper lakes will suffice to refute this opinion, by showing that tides are not necessary to their existence, and that the mere action of waves is sufficient to supply the materials for their formation on an extensive scale. Another feature of dunes, both on the shores of the ocean and of the lakes, which I would mention, is, that they occur only on flat coasts, where the waters are subjected to considerable motion, either from currents, or from the action of the winds, or from both these causes combined. Now, this law is strikingly illustrated by the dunes of the upper lakes. As was stated before, the most conspicuous ones occur on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, in those regions which are most exposed to the winds. The dunes of Pointe aux Chenes, which we have just been describing, are also exactly in the direction of the prevailing winds ; and, moreover, it can be shown that they were formed from west to east ; whereas, the west ern coasts, both of Green Bay and Lake Michigan, are entirely destitute of them. It is true that dunes are equally wanting on the eastern shore of Green Bay ; but this is owing to the steep limestone bluffs which line the coast, and do not favor any considerable accumulation of sand on the beach. The dunes of White-fish Point are also in the direction of the prevailing gales, which blow here from the north-west. Considering the phenomenon of the dunes, as a whole, it would appear that it exclusively belongs to the present era ; at least, we do not know of finy instance of their occurrence referrible to a previous epoch ; whereas,"], [613, "[4] 267 they are frequently found covering the most recent of the quaternary depo- sits. Thus, it is not uncommon to find them resting upon peat bogs, both on this side of the Atlantic and on the European coasts ; and I feel confident that similar instances might be discovered along the upper lakes. At any rate, the fact that they are composed of sand gathered from the beaches is, in itself, sufficient evidence of their very recent origin; it having been shown, in the foregoing pages, that the sand beaches, together with the sand flats of the upper lakes, belong to the most recent deposits. Indeed, so mani- fold are the evidences of the modern origin of dunes that M. Elie de Beau- mont has even proposed to designate the actual period as the Era of dunes. It would appear that, since dunes began to form, no change of any conse- quence has taken place in the relative distribution of land and water, either along the ocean, or in the region of the great lakes. Dune-like Ridges. \u2014 There are various localities along the upper lakes where the dunes seem to pass gradually into sand-beaches, or, at least, assume such a regular outline that it is sometimes difficult to identify them. As an instance, I would mention a series of low ridges near the mouth of Traine river, on Lake Superior, where they cover a surface of at least a mile in width, stretching from N.E. to S.W., and separated by trough-like depressions, generally filled with water. They are also covered by a fine growth of white, yellow and black pines (Pinus Banksiana); so regular and so parallel indeed are these ridges that, when crossing them in going from the interior towards the shore, they appear very much like ancient beaches, and it would be but natural to consider them as such, were it not for theii homogeneous composition. In proportion as we approach nea? the shore, the vegetation disappears, the trees become less abundant, and, at last, the ridges graduate insensibly into the barren dunes which line the river. Now, there can be no doubt that the latter are genuine dunes ; and since they are parallel and identical in composition with the ridges in the rear, the infer- ence is but natural th.it the latter have originated in the same manner. Very probably they are the result of the combined action of wind and waves. A series of similar ridges or parallel dunes occur at the mouth of Miners' river, and also in various places between Grand Marais and Two- hearted river. Near the mouth of the latter river, they rise to the height of eighty feet. When the dune ridges are too crowded, their unequal slope is sufficient to indicate their true origin \u2014 the lee-slope, which is here the eastern, being much steeper and shorter than the opposite or western slope. When, however, as it sometimes happens, the ridges are so crowded as to obliterate these features, it is not always easy to distinguish them from the underlying sand deposit, especially when the latter is composed of fine and homogeneous materials. By closer examination, however, I generally suc- ceeded in discovering some j ice along the shore where the base was strati- fied ; whereas, the ridges ab > re were not. It may still be asked wh'.her these ridges, in spite of their want of stratification, might not have ! cen formed under water through the agency of some current which would L ave prevented a regular stratification ; and, likewise, if their unequal slope might not be owing to some subaqueous cause. Without denying the possibility of such an origin, I would remark, that none of the shoals or submarine ridges with which I am acquainted, exhibit any such feature ; and, moreover, they generally contain some peb bles either intermingled with them or occurring in their immediate vicinity. At any rate, if it should be proved that they are not true dunes, but the"], [614, "[4] 268 result of aqueous action, they can by no means be recent beaches, for their direction far from being parallel to the shore, is almost perpendicular to it. Besides, the recent beaches, in the vicinity of Two-hearted river at least, are entirely different in their composition, consisting almost exclusively of rounded and water-worn pebbles Ancient Beaches and Terraces .\u2014The various kinds of alluvial deposits, which we have thus far been examining, can all be readily explained by the action of existing causes, without recurring to any change in the rela tive level of land and water. There are others, equally independent of any great geological changes, which seem to indicate, however, a higher tage of the waters along the lakes and rivers at the time of their forma tion, or such changes as may be explained by the prolonged action of actual agencies. A most striking example of this kind occurs at Saut Ste. Marie, near the outlet of Lake Superior. There is to be seen on the left bank of the river, an extension terrace, on the margin of which the fort and the village are built. Its height at the fort is twenty-one feet above the water ; thence, it stretches for nearly a mile to the foot of the drift terrace, near the Mis sion farm ; but in the rear of the village there is an abrupt rise of seven feet, especially conspicuous near the Baptist mission. From this point to the foot of the drift terrace, the ground is covered with an endless variety of boulders, which are so numerous in places, as to render the soil unfit for cultivation. The following section (Fig. 34) will show the relative height and position of these terraces. Fig. 34. The materials of the two alluvial terraces (1) are a fine yellow sand, somewhat loamy, and exhibiting in various places marks of cross-stratifi cation. The appearance is so very different from that of the drift of the upper terrace (2) that it must be evident, at fir t sight, that they cannot by any means belong to the same formation. On iie other hand, when we con sider the extent of the terrace and the abrupt manner in which it breaks off at the fort, we feel naturally inclined to ascril e it to a different origin from that of the ordinary alluvial deposits, and I was at first tempted to regard it as belonging to the loess, rather than the alluvium. This impression, however, vanished when I came to examine the topographical features of the locality in detail. The highest terrace at the fort, although twenty feet above the river, is almost on a level with the beach at the head of the rapids."], [615, ""], [616, "Jl<ue, AX <ti BOULDERS AT SAUT SIE MARIE man I .oh 379 Broadway"], [617, "269 [4] Fig. 36. \u00a9 to 3 \u00a3\u00ab Is. E- W. Alluvial terrace at Saut Ste. Marie. 1 . Drift ten-race. -. Alluvial terrace 3. Rapids. The above profile distinctly shows that the height of the terrace above the river, at the fort, is merely the result of the fall of the rapids. If, instead of terminating near the upper part of the village they extended as far down as the fort, the small terrace by the Baptist mission would not by any means exceed Ihe average height of the ordinary alluvial beaches. Now there is, as we shall see farther on, some ground for believing that in former times the rapids extended farther down. At that time the ground on which the fort now stands must have been a wide flat over which the boulders were carried, probably by ice-rafts, and stranded beyond the tem- porary shore, which is indicated by the little terrace near the Baptist mission. There are, besides, n.ear the head of the rapids, patches of alluvial sands and boulders at a still higher level, belonging to the same deposit ; nor is it at all improbable that some of the terraces mentioned by Mr. Bela Hub- bard in his report, as occurring along the shore of Lake Superior, may be- long to this earliest siage of the alluvial period.* Boulders of Saut Ste. Marie. \u2014 In a former report, I alluded to those remarkable accumulations at this point. My object then was merely to show that they did not belong to the drift but the alluvial epoch. Of this we need no better pros than the fact that they are found scattered in great numbeis over the surf ice of the alluvial terrace just described. The litho- graphic, sketch, Plate XX, represents their accumulation on the right bank at the loot of the rap; is, although very conspicuous in the western portion of the village and along the road leading to the head of the portage, and they aie still more at.mdant in the rear of the fort. At the Baptist mis- sion they are found t-venty-eight feet above the foot of the rapids, and it is plain that no freshe'. or gale could have raised the river so as to strand them there ; but, when we take into account the peculiar topography of the country, and start from the level of the river, at the head of the portage instead of below, it w ill be found that their distribution can be accounted for by the operation of such causes as are now in action, and without the necessity of recurring to any considerable change in the level of the coun try. It would appear that a rise of but a few feet would enable the lake to reach the level of the main tracks of the boulders between the head of \u2666According to Mr. Hul'bard, '\u2022' these ridges without doubt once constituted the shores of the lake at an era when its waters were, for a considerable period, at an elevation of about twenty-five or thirty feet above the present level.

Here, however, a difficulty arises with regard to those which extend beyond the rapids. We can readily conceive how those near the head became stranded, especially when encased in ice and heaped upon the shore ; but how are we to account for those which occur at the same level beyond, notwithstanding the twenty feet descent in the river? The only satisfactory explanation is this. If the rapids, instead of terminating at the entrance to the village, had extended at one time beyond the fort, there would be no difficulty in accounting for the position of the boulders. Now, if we consider that the bed of the river is excavated in a fissile sandstone, the supposition is by no means un warrantable that the rapids have receded from the fort to their present* portion, within the alluvial epoch. So far as I know, the boulders extend but a short distance below the rapids, thus shewing that their transporta tion, by whatever means it may have been accomplished, was limited to the immediate neighborhood : consequently, according to this hypothesis, it would not be necessary to assume a recession beyond the limits of a fair analogy. But, suppose farther that the head of the rapids were somewhat higher at that time than now ; we would not only account for the boulders of the neighborhood, but for the alluvial terraces and ancient beaches along the shores of Lake Superior. Mr. Whittlesey has applied this hypothesis to explain the origin of the ancient beaches along the straits of Mackinac. Assuming that the distribution of the boulders at the Saut resulted from the retrocession of the rapids, it will be conceded that their transportation must have taken place gradually and at different periods, since they occur at all levels from the margin of the lake to the distance of ten and fifteen feet above its level, forming in many places groups as though they had been stranded in the same direction. Thus, these boulders, like the dunes and flats of the upper lakes, are to be ranked among the most recent monu ments of the quaternary period ; and there is but little doubt that many have been stranded within the memory of man, although I have not been able to gather any direct information on this point. As another striking instance of stranded boulders, I would mention those of Round island, opposite Mackinac. They occur mainly at the water's edge, on the north-eastern shore ; and, since there is no drift in the neighbor hood from which they could have been washed out, there can hardly be a doubt that they were transported by ice-rafts from distant points, \u2014 perhaps from the northern or north-eastern shore of Lake Huron. We here append an account of the ancient and present beaches of Lake Michigan, by Mr. Whittlesey, as illustrating still farther the phenomena of the superficial deposits of this district. The ancient and present Beaches of Lake Michigan. BY MR. WHITTLESEY. On the subject of the ancient and present beaches of the upper lakes it will not be necessary to dwell at length. The profiles and sections which accompany this chapter will show, at a glance, their uniformity and their characteristic features. They unquestionably belong to the recent period, and are due to fluctuations in the surfaces of the lakes, since the era of the drift. They are the natural modifications of the drift and shingle deposits,"], [619, "271 [4] arising from the action of the waves on the shore. . The most elevated and those intermediate cannot be distinguished in form or composition, from those now being formed at the water's edge. They are, however, deserv ing the name of \" ancient beaches,\" as compared with those of the histori cal period, as is evident from the fact that they are covered with growing trees, such as elms and cedars of very great antiquity. The height to which the action of the waves reaches, and, consequently, the height of the present beaches, depends upon the exposure of the shore, and the force and direction of the prevailing winds. The following sections (Figs. 36, 37) will serve to illustrate their nature : Fig. 36. Beaches at Lime island, St. Mary's river : Distance, ten rods. A. Niagara limestone. B. Water-worn limestone gravel.. Nos. 1, 2, 4, 6, and 12, rep resent the height in feet. The following section (Fig. 37) occurs on the north shore of Lake Michigan, on the south side of point St. Ignace : Fig. 37 Beaches at St. Ignace. The distance is fifteen rods, and the height between the water line and the most ancient of the beaches, is eighteen feet. The underlying rock A consists of the Niagara limestone, covered with water-worn materials, B. There are here no less than five beaches. Numerous sections of this character have been observed at different points. Thus, one mile east of Biddle river, there are four ancient beaches, within the distance of twenty rods, respectively rising ten and one-half, thirteen, fifteen and three-quarters, and seventeen and one-half feet above the water. Two miles east of Point Patterson, there are no less than five, within the distance of thirty rods, respectively rising three, four, six, fif teen, and eighteen feet above the water. One mile west of Seul Choix, there are three, rising, respectively, six, twelve, and fifteen feet. The coast bluffs on the west side of St. Martin's island present a.sec tion somewhat like the following (Fig. 38) : Fig. 38. A. Niagara limestone. B. Coarse, water-washed limestone gravel, fourteen feet above tb\u00ab lake-level."], [620, "[ 4 ] 272 On the north-east side of Potawatomee island, the cliffs of limestone rise to the height of eighty feet ; but, resting on a projection, as in the above section, is seen the remnant of an ancient beach, eighteen sect above the lake-level. It is deemed unnecessary to give further examples. By referring to the subsequent chapter on the fluctuations of the sur faces of the lakes, it will be seen that Lake Michigan and Lake Erie have, since the beginning of the present century, varied about six feet. In case that the waters of lakes Michigan and Huron have stood for a considerable length of time \u2014 say one or two years \u2014 at an elevation of six feet above the level of the summer of 1850, the ridges within twelve feet of the water line on the above sections would have been formed. It will be perceived that a majority of these sections have four ridges, often less, but in only one instance more. . Four stages of considerable promi nence are thus indicated, and the effects of the lake waters, in no case, are perceived at a higher elevation than eighteen feet. The two most interesting cases of water-washed beach gravel, raised to considerable elevations, are at the cliffs of St. Martin's and the Potawato mee islands. These are upon perpendicular or shelving rocks, with no shingle at their base. It will be perceived that the fourth and oldest beach is very uniform in height. In few places it does not fall below sixteen, or rise above eighteen feet. On the supposition that a beach of eighteen feet indicates a stage of water six feet below the crest of the ridge, as it does, generally, at the pre sent time, the most elevated stage of the lake must have been twelve feet above that of 1850. The lakes during that year were low, but not so low as they have been since the permanent settlement of the country by the whites. Allowing six feet as the greatest known and recorded fhctuation, it places the stage of water, which formed the most ancient of the beaches, more than six feet above the highest known stage. May not this state of things occur again ? It has not, evidently, taken place within several centuries, since trees are found flourishing on the third and fourth beache:1. Such an event would be of no great detriment to wild beasts or savages, hut would prove a great calamity to a civilized people. It is evident, from our own observations on the rise of the lake waters, that the outlets ai e not suffi cient to allow a rapidly accumulating surplus to pass off wit hi. 1 several years. Suppose that there was a long succession of humid seasors over the whole area ; there is nothing to prevent a rise heyond what we have yet observed. An examination of the statements furnished in the si cceeding chapter, as to the amount of falling water in the lake country, the loss by evaporation, and the comparative surface of the reservoirs into which it must flow, will show that a much greater rise might, in a certain combina tion of circumstances be reasonably expected. On the other hand, it is probable that the outlet of Lake Huren, at Fort Gratiot, has been deepened, if not widened, by the action of a strong and ceaseless current, operating for many centuries on a sand and gv&\\ el bottom. The outlets of lakes Superior and Erie, being over a rocky bed, have not probably changed as much. So far as my observations go, there ave not to be found around their borders, ridges and beaches of recent oiigin, as high as those of Huron and Michigan. The former, if their dtbuuchures have remained entire, have been exposed to the sajne meteorological causes,"], [621, "[4] 273 and should therefore show evidences of equally high water. I infer, there fore, that the beaches of lakes Huron and Michigan afford probable eviaence of a change in their outlet, by widening and deepening the channel. I do not allude, in this connection, to those terraces and ridges which border all the lakes at an elevation ranging from thirty to two hundred and fifty feet. These are due to a much more ancient and permanent elevation of the waters, \u2014 phenomena which have been discussed in a previous portion of the report."], [622, "274 [4] CHAPTER XVII.

Among the many interesting subjects of investigation to the geological observer, there are few which can so justly claim a large share of his atten tion as that of the structure and relations of mountain chains. Next to the division of the surface of the earth into land and water, the direction, height, and form of the elevated ridges, which traverse the land, play the most im portant part in its physical history. While the student of philology, ethnog raphy, and physical geography alike see the immense influence which the position and direction of mountain chains have exercised in the distribu tion of languages, in the migration of races of men, in giving form and out line to continents, and in the modification of climate ; the geologist acknow ledges in them the grandest and most imperishable record of the great cycle of events, the study of which is his peculiar province. Hence those inquiries, which have for their object the determination of the nature of the dynamical forces which have given origin to the great features of the earth's surface, the laws which have regulated their direc tion and their chronological succession, will be readily acknowledged to be of the highest importance. To these investigations the attention of geologists has been especially directed by the comprehensive labors of Elie de Beaumont, who for the last twenty years has made this the jfcrticular subject of study, and whose researches have been distinguished By the most admirable ingenuity and perseverance. The object of this chapter is to call attention, we will not say to the theory, but to the great facts which have been developed by De Beaumont, in the course of his investigations, and then attempt to compare some of these re sults with corresponding ones on this side of the Atlantic ; and especially such as have been obtained by us in the region of Lake Superior. In order to a clear understanding of this subject, it will be necessary to consider the internal structure of mountain chains ; and also some of the principal theories which have been proposed to account for their formation, or elevation. ' Here, however, it is important to bear in mind that the ob- servations of De Beaumont are entirely independent of any theory with re- gard to the peculiar mode of upheaval of mountains, or the causes by which the ridging and folding of the earth's crust have been produced. His great object has been, simply to trace out, on the surface of the globe, the direc-"], [623, "275 [ 4 ] lion of the great, lines of fracture and uplift, and to ascertain their relative orders of succession. The result of his investigations has been to accumulate a great mass of facts which seem to show a very near approach to parallelism in the mountain chains, or lines of si%cture of the same geological epoch throughout the continent of Europe, which has been the principal field of his researches. He has, however, not confined his investigations to that conti nent only, but has traced out, in other countries, several of the systems of elevation which he has recognized in Europe, and shown a marked coinci dence in their direction, \u2014 indicating that certain movements of the earth's crust had taken place simultaneously, and in parallel lines over a large por tion of its surface. The whole subject of the parallelism of mountain chains, and the determi nation of their relative ages, depends on the arrangement and position of the different stratified groups which have been disturbed and elevated at the epoch of their formation ; orwhich, since that period, have been deposited in a nearly horizontal position upon the previously disturbed strata. If the stratified beds on the flanks of a mountain dip away from it at a considerable angle, it is evident, that, having been originally deposited in a nearly horizontal position, the elevation of the mountain, which was the cause of their disturbance, must have taken place after their deposition ; or, in other words, that it was a more recent geological event. If a group of strata dip at a high angle from the central elevated mass, and is again covered by another group inclined at a less angle than the former, but still having a considerable dip, it would be equally evident that there had been two successive epochs of disturbance ; one after the deposition of the first group, and a second after another set of strata had been deposited horizontally upon the first. If, on the other hand, the elevated strata, dip ping at a considerable angle from the mountain, are covered by others rest ing horizontally on them, it is plain that the elevation of the central mass took place at a period between the deposition of the first and second series. Thus the relation of mountain chains is fixed, by reference to the age of the strata which had been deposited at the epoch when the disturbance or uplift took place. On examining the structure of mountain chains, however, it is not unfre quently foujid that the phenomena which they present are of a more compli cated character, since the action of the elevatory forces was not exerted in such a manner as to produce a single ridge, from which, on either side, the strata dip at an equal angle. There may be a succession of parallel ridges or flexures, in which the strata assume a great variety of positions, accord ing to their relative distance from #ie line from which the disturbing force is supposed to have acted. Thus in the admirable sections of the Professors Rogers across the great Appalachian chain, we have a series of plications or flexures more abrupt near the line of disturbing action, and gradually opening out as we recede from it. In the Alps of Switzerland, we have abundant examples of the folding of a whole series of sedimentary beds in numerous and abrupt plica tions. Here, indeed, large masses of strata are sometimes bent back upon themselves-, so that the lower members appear to overlie the upper ; and instances occur, in which beds of an older geological epoch are inverted, and appear for a great distance, superimposed on those of a much newer epoch. Besides this, there are many instances where the elevation of the strata"], [624, "s 4 ] 276 has not been attended by any actual protrusion of igneous matter, forming a ridge or crest, but in which the direction of the elevating forces must be inferred from the prevailing strike of the strata. Thus the direction of actual mountain ridges is not onlyto be taken into consideration, but the general direction of the stratified masses becomes an essential element of such investigations. , Almost all geologists are agreed in opinion as to the great fundamental cause of the wrinkling or ridging of the earth's crust ; or, in other words, the formation of mountain chains. The theory now almost universally adopted is founded on the combined results of the most careful observa tions of distinguished physicists and geologists, and the profoundest calcu lations of astronomical and mathematical science. According to this theory, it is inferred that the earth was once at a much higher temperature than at present ; indeed, that, in all probability, it has been in a state of liquid fusion ; that, among the first results of the cooling process, was the forma tion of a solid crust, thin at first, but gradually increasing in thickness over the still liquid interior ; and that, as the secular refrigeration continued, the interior gradually contracted, while the exterior shell or portion was rup tured, or bent and folded, in endeavoring to accommodate itself to the shrunken nucleus on which it rested. General as is the adherence among geologists to the idea of the wrinkling of the earth's crust having been the result of the cooling of the exterior, they are much divided in opinion with regard to the laws which nave gov erned the action of this great cause, and the precise nature of the chain of events by which the present state of the surface has been brought about. Every year, however, seems to indicate a nearer approach to uniformity of opinion among those engaged in these investigations ; in fact, the two great leaders in theoretical geology, in the Geological Society of France, have admitted that their differences of opinion related in reality to the use of words, rather than the facts themselves. The principal question which still remains in discussion between them is, whether the w-ord elevation can be properly applied to the designation of a phenomenon dependent on the sinking. of the earth's crust; M. de Beaumont maintaining that, inasmuch as the chief visible effect is to produce a comparative elevation of a certain portion of the surface, therefore, the word elevation may with pro priety be retained in use to designate the formation of mountain chains. It is to the Danish philosopher, Steensen, that we are indebted for the first recognition of the fact that strata of different ages may be distin guished from each other by their discordance of stratification, while to Humboldt is due the credit of havingjfirst called attention to the constancy of direction in the so-called primary schistose strata. To Elie de Beau mont must be ascribed the first distinct attempt to investigate systematically the laws which have governed the upheaval of mountain masses, and the recognition of the parallelism of elevation of the same geological age over different portions of the earth's surface ; these researches, which have been carried on for many years with untiring patience, have been communicated to the world, principally through the medium of the publications of the Academy of Sciences and the Geological Society of France. \u2022 In his most recent publications on this subject, De Beaumont has coordi nated his observations and placed them upon a mathematical basis, by con necting all his great circles of comparison into one vast net- work, the position of which upon the surface of the globe is determined by the geo-"], [625, "277 [ 4 ] graphical position of a single point, and the direction of a great circle starting from that point. This net-work has for its base fifteen great \"circles cutting each other, so as to divide the surface of the spheres into regular pentagons ; while from these pentagonal areas, other supplementary circles are developed according to certain simple mathematical laws. The great result of these investigations is, that the wrinkling of the earth's crust has been effected in a series of arcs, the directions of which coincide with the lines of most easy crushing of a sphere, gradually contracting in its dimen sions. Our object in this chapter is to call attention to the investigations of geologists in this department of dynamics; and, so far as is in our power, to furnish the materials for a comparison of the systems of elevation observ ed in this country, and especially those which we have recognized in our own district, with those which have been determined by De Beaumont. For this purpose, we shall first describe some of the principal systems of elevation which have given configuration to the continent of North America, and particularly those wThich form the rim of the Lake Superior basin ; we shall then proceed to enumerate some of the more important of De Beau mont's systems, and particularly such as from their age and direction appear to be of more importance in this country. The number of these systems has gone on increasing as the researches of geologists have gradually extended, and new facts have been accumulated ; and it is to be expected that every year will add to this list, and accumulate new data of compari son for such as have already been adopted. SYSTEMS OF ELEVATION IN NORTH AMERICA. There are three grand systems of elevation which appear mainly to have determined the outlines of North America. 1. The first we denominate the Lake Superior system, since it is de veloped on both shores of the lake, forming the divortia aquarum between Hudson's bay on the one hand, and between the river systems of Lake Su perior and Lake Michigan on the other. The rocks comprising it consist ot granite, gneiss, hornblende, talcose and chlorite slates, and belong to the azoic series. The lowest member of the Silurian series, wherever observed in the basin of Lake Superior, is found to rest undisturbed upon the up turned edges of these slates, or to occupy preexisting depressions in the igneous rocks, leaving no doubt that these schists were elevated and folded before the dawn of the Silurian epoch. The direction of the lines of bear ing is about N. 80\u00b0 E., S. 80\u00b0 W. This system, as developed on Lake Superior, is but a portion of a con tinuous belt which stretches from Labrador to the sources of the Mississippi forming the northern brim of the St. Lawrence valley\u2014 and probably beyond, even to the flanks of the Rocky mountains. Northwardly, according to Sir John Richardson, it extends to Coronation gulf in the Arctic sea. Upon the northern flanks of this belt, as upon the southern, the Silurian groups rest unconformably.* If we examine a good map of North America, we find that this best ot country, lying between Hudson's bay and the Rocky mountains and em bracing nearly 30\u00b0 of latitude, is furrowed with ridges, the prevailing direc- London Quarterly Journal, Geological Society, v. viii., p. 212."], [626, "[4^ 278 tion of which is a little north of east and south of west ; among these may be mentioned the Arctic hills, the High hills, and the Caribou mountains The trend of the principal lakes conforms to this direction. This is the case with the Great Bear lake, near the borders of the Arctic sea, Slave lake, Athabasca lake, and Lake Superior. The trend, however, of Great and Little Winnepeg is at nearly right angles to this direction, and it may have resulted from a transverse fissure. The trend of lakes Michigan and Huron, also, may be said to be a deviation from this east and west system, but we have shown that this has resulted from denudation rather than from subsi dence. The Great-fish, the Unjiguh, or Peace river, the Assiniboin, and Saskat chewin rivers appear to flow along longitudinal valleys ; while the Macken zie, Slave, and Athabasca rivers apparently flow through a transverse fissure of the age, it may be, of the Rocky mountain system. The granite and schists composing this system formed the ancient conti nent of North America, wdaose culminating points, in the Lake Superior dis trict, rose not more than a thousand feet above the waters of the Silurian sea. It stretched out in a long and narrow belt, east and west, from La brador to the sources of the Mississippi ; and north and south, from the borders of Michigan to the Arctic sea. At that time, the Appalachian and Rocky mountain chains had not been elevated, and, with the exception of a few isolated patches in the form of islands, the whole area of the United States constituted a portion of the bed of the primeval sea. 2. The second may be designated as the Appalachian system, which has given configuration to the eastern slope of North America ; and the period of its elevation may be referred to the close of the carboniferous epoch. It commences near the outlet of the St. Lawrence, and terminates in northern Alabama ; pursuing a course nearly north-east and south-west. The series of rocks composing it, according to the Messieurs Rogers, present an almost unbroken succession of conforming strata from the lowest mem bers which repose immediately on the primary, or metamorphic rocks, to the highest carboniferous strata. The New red sandstone, which extends con tinuously in a narrow belt from the valley of the Connecticut to beyond Vir ginia, reposes immediately on the folded strata of this chain, and furnishes not the slightest indication of having been disturbed by the movements which produced the numerous axes beneath.* 3. The third may be denominated the Rocky Mountain system, which, according to Sir John Richardson, \" has a general course for two thousand five hundred miles, \u2014 or, from the thirtieth parallel of latitude to the Arctic sea,\u2014 of N. 26\u00b0 W., S. 26\u00b0 E., or N.W. by N.\"f It spreads out into a belt nearly one thousand five hundred miles i.i diameter, between the Mississippi valley and the Pacific ocean, consisting of numerous gentle corru gations, as shown by Fremont, but occasionally swelling into lofty ridges. There is little doubt, from the concurrent testimony of all the explorers, that its age is as recent as the cretaceous period, and therefore among the most recent of those geological events which have modified the outlines of continents. On both sides of the equator it is, in places, flanked by calca reous strata containing, according to Von Buch, fossils characteristic of the chalk. These were also observed by Humboldt between Guambos and \u2022Transactions of the American Geologists, (1840-'42) p. 522. t Quarterly Journal, before cited."], [627, "[4] 279 Montan, nearly one thousand three hundred feet above the sea ; and Neoco min fossils were obtained by Tschudi in the cordilleras of Peru. The explorations of Fremont and others, in the Rocky mountains, con firm these views as to the recent age of this system. These are the three great systems which appear mainly to have deter mined the outlines of North America ; but there are, in the Lake Superior district, subordinate systems which we will proceed to describe. 4. The system of Kaministiquia. \u2014 This is developed on the north-west coast of Lake Superior, between Pigeon river and Thunder bay. Its direc tion is nearly north-east and south-west, and traces of it are to be observed in the parallel course of the principal rivers which enter Hudson's bay from the south-west, among which may be enumerated Moose, Albany, Sev ern, Nelson and Churchill rivers, extending through at least fifteen degrees of longitude. This is the most ancient, so far as we yet know, of all the systems of North America ; and the age of its elevation was prior to the close of the azoic period, since the upper portions of the azoic slates rest undisturbed upon the granite axis. 5. The system of Isle Royale and Keweenaw Point. \u2014 This embraces the crystalline greenstone of the Copper region, which lifted up the bedded trap, sandstone and conglomerate at angles varying from 40\u00b0 to 70\u00b0. The precise period of its elevation cannot be determined, but it probably took place near the close of the lowTer Silurian epoch, since we find that the Trenton limestone of the Sturgeon river valley has been disturbed by it. The di rection of these axes is somewhat variable. On Isle Royale, they are N. 65\u00b0 E.; but, on the southern shore they bear N. 52\u00b0 E.,* though subject to minor deviations, \u2014 the trap ranges in many places assuming crescent shaped forms. Although the great mass of rock has been subject to no intense disturbance since the close of the Silurian epoch, yet it has expe rienced a succession of widely-extended oscillations, which have been dis cussed under another head (Chapter IX). Thus, it would appear that, in North America, the oldest lines of frac ture pursue an easterly and westerly direction, while the more recent ones pursue a northerly and southerly direction. Having thus given an outlifie of the great systems of elevation which have, as we conceive, during different epochs, gradually brought about the present form of this continent, we proceed to consider the European systems. SYSTEMS OF ELEVATION IN EUROPE. In his first publication,! in 1829, De Beaumont recognized only four sys tems of mountain chains, but the year following he augmented the number to nine, J to wit : , . _ . 1. System of the main chain of the Alps ; direction E. and W., which raised the older diluvial deposits. 2. System of the western Alps (from Marseilles to Zurich) ; direction N. 26\u00b0 E., which raised the upper tertiary. * This is the direction of a line drawn from the southern limits of the trap, on the Montreal river, to the southern limits on Keweenaw Point. \u201e\u00ab\",\u00bb. r. \u201e*\u201e., Por,H,ia t Recherches sur quelques unes des revolutions de la surface du globe.

System of the Pyrenees and Appenines ; direction N.W. and S.E., which raised the chalk and green-sand. 5. System of the Cote d\"Or (Burgundy), the Erzgebirge (Germany) ; direction S.W. and N.E., which raised the Jura limestone. 6. System of the Vendee, Thuringia, and Bohemia ; direction N.W. and S.E. which raised the Trias. 7. System of the Rhine ; direction N. and S., or N.N.E. and S.S.W., which raised the sandstone of the Vosges (which he considers distinct from the variegated), and zeichstein. 8. System of the Netherlands and South Wales ; direction N.E. and S. W., which raised the coal measures. 9. System of the Ballons (Vosges) and Bocage, Western France ; di rection N. 74\u00b0 W., S. 74\u00b0 E., which raised the carboniferous limestone. In his last principal communication,* De Beaumont has shown that there are at least three different systems of elevation included in the above named direction ; and since M. Riviere had previously noticed another an cient system on the south-western coast of the Vendee, the direction of which was nearly N.W. and S.E., this system was added to the other three, making four, all of which are older than the oldest in the above list. To these four ancient systems, still another must be added, which was also observed by Riviere, in the Vendee, and supposed by him to be the oldest known system of Europe. These five systems are as follows, \u2014 beginning with the oldest and proceeding in the order of their relative age, as determined by De Beaumont : 1. System of the Vendee ; direction at Vannes, \u2014 latitude 47\u00b0 39' 26\" N., longitude 2\u00b0 46' W.\u2014 N. 22\u00b0 30' W. Age, anterior to the system of Finisterre. 2. System of Finisterre ; direction at Brest \u2014 latitude 48\u00b0 23' N., longitude 4\u00b0 29' W. \u2014 N. 68* 15' E. Age, posterior to the oldest schists of Britanny. 3. System of Longmynd ; direction at the Binger-loch, \u2014 latitude 49\u00b0 55' N. ; longitude 7\u00b0 50' E. \u2014 N. 31\u00b0 15' E. Age, after the deposition of the green slates of Wales and the feldstones. 4. System of Morbihan ; direction at Vannes, N. 51\u00b0 45' W. Age, posterior to the Bala limestone of Wales. 5. System of Westmoreland and the Hundsrilck ; direction at the Binger- loch, N. 58\u00b0 30' E. Age, posterior to the Silurian and a part of the Devonian, but anterior to the Old red sandstone. In a still later communication,! De Beaumont recognizes twenty-one sys tems as having been determined with more or less precision, but none of the new ones which he has adopted are as old as those given above ; Durocher, however, has recently announced the existence of six new sys tems of upheaval, in Scandinavia, older than the lower Silurian, or belonging to the azoic period. Besides these, he recognizes the existence there of the four oldest systems of De Beaumont, enumerated above. The data of direction and relative age of the new systems proposed by Durocher are so * \"Notes sur les systemes de montagues les plus anciens de 1' Europe:\" Bulletin de la Societe geologique de France: Ser.

For the purpose of making a comparison between our own systems of upheaval and those of Europe, it will be especially necessary to fix, as near ly as possible, on the equivalency of the older systems of rocks in the two countries, since the age of the oldest systems of upheaval are determined by De Beaumont, principally by reference to certain groups as developed in England, Wales, and Britanny. The following scheme is as accurate as could be expected, in the present state of geological knowledge. For a critical examination of the data on which this parallelism is founded, the reader is referred to the succeeding chapter by Mr. Hall. America. Eueope. Azoic System.

Bala limestone of Wales ; Llandielo flags and Caradoc sandstone of Great Britain. The above comparison of the lower Silurian groups of the two continents seems to accord with the results of the geological survey of Wales. There, according to a communication of Barrande to the Geological Society of France,* in which he gives the result of- his own examination of the mate rials collected by the survey, the Caradoc sandstone is distinctly recognized as being between the upper and lower Silurian divisions, while the Bala limestone and the Llandeilo flags form the upper portion of the lower Silurian, corresponding with the Hudson-river group in this country. We now propose to inquire how far the ancient systems of upheaval, re cognized by De Beaumont as existing in Europe, agree with those previously enumerated as occurring in North America. Four of the European systems are shown by De Beaumont to be prior in age to the deposition of the Ca radoc sandstone, and we have enumerated three which are of at least as high antiquity in the region of Lake Superior. While, however, two of our systems are shown conclusively to be older than the pal\u00e6ozoic epoch, the age of the oldest European systems, with regard to the oldest strata containing organic life, is by no means so clearly settled. In order, however, to institute a comparison between these oldest \u2022Bulletin, Ser. II. T. 8, p. 207. (January, 1851.)"], [630, "[4] 282 systems of Europe and those recognized by us, we have calculated the direc tion which they would assume if transferred to the region of Lake Superior.* 1. The system of the Vendee ; the direction of which, at Vannes, is N. 22\u00b0 30' W., becomes\u2014 in longitude 87\u00b0 30' W., and latitude 47\u00b0 30'N.,\u2014 . N. 79\u00b0 53' E. 2. The system of Finisterre ; the direction of which, at Brest, is N. 68\u00b0 15' E., becomes\u2014 in latitude 42\u00b0 22' N. and longitude 72\u00b0 32' W.\u2014 N. 38\u00b0 20' W. 3. The system of Longmynd ; the direction of which, at Binger-loch, is N. 31\u00b0 15' E., becomes N. 53\u00b0 40' W. 4. The system of Morbihan ; of which the direction, at Vannes, is N. 51\u00b0 45' W., becomes N. 60\u00b0 30' E. On comparing these results with the directions of the systems of upheaval, before indicated as occurring in the Lake Superior region, we find that the direction of two of these systems coincides very nearly with that of two of those which have been calculated above. The Lake Superior system agrees with the system of the Vendee ; the for mer being about N. 80\u00b0 E., S. 80\u00b0 W., and the latter, transferred as above, N. 79\u00b0 53' E., S. 79\u00b0 53' W. With regard to the age of the system of the Vendee we quote the follow ing from the last publication of Riviere on this subject : \" I have united all the normal directions of the gneissoid rocks of the Vendee into one system of dislocations, to which I have given the name of the system of the Vendee. * * * This is probably the most ancient normal system ; at all events, it is the oldest system known ; if it was preceded by other sys tems, these must be sought for in the north of Russia or in America, where the transition strata appear to be nearly horizontal, * * The gneissoid formation is completely distinct from, and anterior to, the transi tion (Silurian or Cambrian) strata.\" We may, therefore, presume that there is no doubt that both these sys tems, the European and American, are anterior to the deposition of the old est fossiliferous strata, and thus far the agreement of the two in age and direction is sufficiently satisfactory. The system of Kaministiquia, which seems to be the oldest which we have been able to recognize in America, appears to be older than any sys tem of upheavals thus far admitted by De Beaumont. A coincidence will, perhaps, be found, after farther observations shall have been made as to its precise direction in this country, and after the numerous systems of the azoic period in other regions shall have been worked out with clearness and precision. As the region to which this system is confined in this country lies without the limits of our district, we have not been able to fix its direction with the precision requisite for a comparison with those of other coimtries. The system of Keweenaw Point agrees very nearly in its mean direction with that of Morbihan, of which the direction, when transferred to the region of Lake Superior, becomes N. 60\u00b0 30' E. The coincidence of this direction with that of Isle Royale had already been noticed by De Beau mont, who drew the inference that the sandstone and conglomerate of that island could not belong to the New red sandstone, as maintained by Dr. C. T. Jackson. \u2022The substance of this chapter was communicated to the American Association for the Ad vancement of Science, at a meeting held at Cincinnati in May, 1851."], [631, "283 [4] If, however, we proceed to inquire as to the coincidence in age of the systems of Keweenaw Point and Morbihan, we find that there is good reason to suppose that they may belong to the same geological epoch. The elevation of the sandstones, conglomerates and bedded traps of the Lake Superior region appears to have taken place at a period not far removed from that of the deposition of the Hudson-river group. This is inferred from the position of the deposit of lower Silurian limestone near L'Anse, which appears to have been disturbed by the same causes which produced the ele vation of the trap and conglomerate of Keweenaw Point. As was shown in Part I. of this report, the age of the highest beds of this deposit is not more recent than that, of the Hudson-river group, so that as far as can be known, this elevation must have taken place during the lower Silurian epoch. According to De Beaumont, the age of the system of Morbihan is ante rior to the deposition of the Caradoc sandstone and posterior to that, of the Bala limestone. If it were admitted that the Caradoc sandstone is the equivalent of the Potsdam, we should be unable to recognize any agree ment in the ages of the two systems in question. The age of the Caradoc sandstone, as well as that of the Bala limestone, seems at the present time to be better understood than when De Beaumont published the article before referred to, in which the ages of the older systems of elevation are so ably discussed. If we consider, as we are authorized to do by the most recent authori ties,* the Caradoc sandstone as forming the upper portion of the lower Silurian, and overlying unconformably the Bala limestone, the next inferior member of the same group, we shall have a perfect correspondence in the age of the system of Morbihan, in Wales, with that of Keweenaw Point, in the Lake Superior region. This parallelism of the groups in the two countries is conformable to the results of Mr. Hall's investigations, as given in the succeeding chapter. As to the Appalachian system, De Beaumont was at first inclined to refer it to that of the Pyrenees, but now considers it as belonging, partly at least, to the system of the Ballons, the direction of which is N. 74\u00b0 W.; but which, when transferred to the meridian of Washington, becomes N. 46\u00b0 42' E., a direction which almost exactly agrees, with the outcrop of the principal ridges. There is also another direction to be noticed in the Alleghanies, which is nearly parallel with the meridian, although at many localities it becomes merged with the former. This is known as the oldest meridional system of Hitchcock, and is supposed by him to embrace the White moun tains of New Hampshire ; \" and it would appear,\" he remarks, \" as if the strata had been deranged by the N.E. and S.W. system, which would go to show that the latter was more recent. \"t The Messieurs Rogers maintain that these two directions have originated simultaneously, and are intimately connected in their whole composition ; but, admitting that they are distinct in age, and discarding the existence of the so-called Taconic system, the meridional system remains an anomaly, not only as to its age, but in its parallelism with any of the older systems of Europe. . As to the Rocky mountain system, its parallel is to be sought in Asia rather than in Europe. Erman states that the great chain of Alden in east ern Asia, which forms the water-shed between the river systems of the Arctic * Bulletin of the Geological Society of France ; Series II. Vol. 8, p. 207. f Geology of Massachusetts, p. 710."], [632, "284 [41 I and Pacific oceans, if protracted in the direction of a great circle, or follow ing the shortest course from point to point, would intersect several of the principal summits of the Rocky mountains between 40\u00b0 and 45\u00b0, thus indi cating that, though widely asunder, they belong to one great fissure.* It is worthy of remark that this chain, like the Rocky mountains, is in many places covered with volcanic materials, and several of the highest summits consist of active volcanoes. We have no information as to the character and age of the sedimentary rocks which repose on its flanks. We have thus attempted to trace a parallelism between the mountain systems of the two hemispheres. We are disposed to regard these axes of elevation, not simply as irregular lines of limited extent, but as possessing much uniformity in direction and traversing entire continents ; but we admit that, in the present state of geographical and geological knowledge, abso lutely certain conclusions cannot be attained. Our object has been to call the attention of American geologists to one of the most interesting problems in this science \u2014 one which, thus far, has not received the attention which it deserves. We have had another object in view. Many European physi cists have represented this continent as being emphatically new \u2014 not simply in reference to its settlement and civilization, but to the period when it first emerged above the ocean. We have shown conclusively, we think, that the period of its emergence was at least contemporary with, if not prior to, that of the eastern continent, although its outlines were very dif ferent from what we now behold. In the succeeding epochs we witness the operation of the same great forces, though not perhaps in all instances simultaneously exerted in the two hemispheres. The seas swarmed with the same types of animal life, and the same forms of vegetable life clothed the land. \u2022 Reise urn die Erde."], [633, "285 [4] CHAPTER XVIH.

So much has already been said upon this question, that it might appear superfluous to add anything more at the present time. We are, however, constantly learning more of our own systems of stratified deposits, and, of course, gradually becoming better able to compare them with what we regard as the equivalent systems in Europe. It was natural and agreeable to us, when we began our serious investigations into the condition and age of our pal\u00e6ozoic strata, to desire to identify what we found in this country with that which had been previously described on the other side of the Atlantic. In our too ready willingness to believe that nothing would be found here, except what had an equivalent abroad, wre seized upon evidence and formed conclusions which farther investigations have proved to be erro neous. The publication of Murchison's \" Silurian System\" gave the first clue to anything like a satisfactory recognition of our strata, and their identifi- cation with their European equivalents. The subsequent publication of the \"Pal\u00e6ozoic Fossils of Devon,\" &c, and the establishment of a Devonian system in England, left us in no doubt as to the exact equivalency of some of our groups. The facts, if facts they shall prove, that many Silurian fossils exist also in Devonian rocks, seemed to us, however, strangely at with those in our own country, where we certainly have had opportunities of examining as wide an area, and of deriving our informa- tion from beds as well marked in character, and far less distant in position. Our data, collected over fields of wide extent and admirably adapted for such examinations, had shown us that the fossils were far more restricted in their geological range than had hitherto been supposed. We were able to subdivide what appeared to be the equivalent of the systems and groups recognized in England ; and, in some instances, that which had previously been regarded as one group, has been found to be made up, in this country, of two or more distinct and widely separated members. Even after this subdivision, we were still able to recognize and trace other and minute divisions over a large section of country. Although we"], [634, "[4] 286 have been charged with impeding the progress of geology by these minute subdivisions, introduced in the geological survey of the State of New York, we have adhered to a system based on researches made over an extent of many thousand square miles, and by so doing we believe that an impulse has been given to the study of geological science and to the collection of fossils ; and the more careful and minute the subdivisions, the more fully and completely have the observers been able to work out the details. By this system we have a better knowledge of the changes which took place in the bed of the pal\u00e6ozoic ocean, and the consequent variations in the character of its fauna, than has yet been obtained in many other parts of the world, where the series of strata has been studied for a much longer period.* The thinning out and disappearance of a single member of even a sub ordinate group, and the consequent disappearance, in part or entirely, of its fauna, is a point of great interest in our geological investigations, and it is by this kind of study that we have found a clue to the character of our pal\u00e6ozoic fauna, which has not yet been reached in the exploration of the deposits of more modern geological epochs. Although many of these minor subdivisions cannot be recognized in remote parts of the United States, yet the knowledge of their existence at another point enables the observer to detect their absence and to direct his attention to certain horizons, in order that he may ascertain whether the fauna of the absent member of the series has ever existed at all at that remote point, or whether it may have been mingled with that of a higher member of the same group with which it was contemporary. It is true that the greater subdivisions are more readily recognized, because they require less scrutiny to detect them than the more subordinate members. I may farther add that, until we are willing to study our formations with this degree of minuteness, we can have no positive knowledge of the duration of species, nor of the value of groups of species in the identification of strata. If we would determine whether species have ceased to exist in one part of the ocean, while they have flourished long afterwards in a distant region, it can only be done by a critical study of the subordinate groups, and the individual members of every group in the series. The simplest principles of elementary geology teach us that sedimentary beds, having the same thickness and the same lithological characters, cannot have spread over an area so wide as that now included between the Euro pean and American continents. All sedimentary deposits must vary in character at remote points, as the physical conditions of the ocean cannot be presumed to have remained the same over a wide extent of surface. Under such circumstances, absolute parallelism is not to be sought for or expected. Calcareous deposits, as would naturally be supposed, have been found to be more persistent and more uniform in the character of their fossil contents ; but these, over some portion of their extent, have often been in vaded by argillaceous and arenaceous sediments, and the fauna is found to be in a greater or less degree influenced by such circumstances. In dis tant and disconnected localities, we are compelled to base our opinions of the equivalency of beds, upon the organic remains which they contain ; and when we reflect that the nature of the sediment may in a great degree influence the character of the fossils, we shall not fail to recognize the necessity of keeping the character of these lithological changes in view. \u2022 I might instance here as an example the carboniferous system of England, of which the details are, as yet, but little known."], [635, "-w__ 287 f 4 1 \u2022 The coarse conglomerates and grits, which are so frequently found inter calated in the series, indicate not only disturbance in the waters of the ocean, but also the proximity of the land ; since we know that the effects of the waves, as manifested at this day, -is to confine these materials to the shore, or if they are transported by currents, the velocity soon becomes so far diminished, as to allow of their deposition in comparatively shoal water. As a general rule, therefore, the former class may be regarded as deep-sea deposits, while the latter may be regarded as littoral. When, too, we con sider that marine life is greatly modified by the character of the sea-bottom, we ought not to look for a fauna specifically identical in the different classes of deposits. The conglomerates and grits, for the most part, are barren of organic life, while the limestones are richly stored with it. We have shown that the coarse grits in the New York series, are restricted in their range, while certain limestone groups spread out over an immense area. Besides the changes which take place in the nature of the sediment depo sited upon the bed of the ocean, we are to look to other important condi tions which may affect the fauna, and, consequently, our conclusions regard ing the equivalency of formations. Among the most important of these is the depth of the ocean in which the animals lived, since we know that certain species are confined within certain zones, depending on the depth of the water. There are other conditions which sensibly affect the distribution of or ganic life, such as temperature, pressure and light ; but as these have been fully discussed by Messrs. Foster and Whitney, in a previous part of this report (p. 183), I need not here pause to inquire as to the extent to which these conditions operate. In investigating the fauna of past ages, we see nothing to lead us to believe that the same great laws which regulate the distribution of species, did not then operate with as great effect as at the present time. COMPARISON OF THE PAL\u00c6OZOIC GROUPS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES. Before proceeding to compare the pal\u00e6ozoic series of the United States with those of the same age in Europe, it will be necessary to institute some comparison between the successive groups as they occur in different parts of our own country. The succession, which has been clearly made out in the eastern extension of these deposits, has not been determined on with the same degree of precision at the West, and this for want of that knowledge which can only be obtained by a minute examination of all the interme- diate points. We have already, in the preceding pages, alluded to the changes which have been recognized in tracing the development of the pal\u00e6ozoic series from the east towards the west. In order to facilitate the comparison we are about to make, we give below a table of the successive groups which have been determined in the State of New York. It is here that the series is more complete than in any other portion of the globe, and to this standard it is most convenient and satisfactory for us to make reference in our critical discussion."], [636, "[4] 288 Table of the pal\u00e6ozoic Series in Mew York ; from the Base to the highest Group recognized. 1.

The area over which each one has been traced is quite sufficient to establish its distinctive character and relative importance. On the left hand I have indicated the grouping which has been found to agree best with the prevailing pal\u00e6ozoic features, and with the lithological characters. The lower Silurian limestones from the Chazy, including the Trenton limestone, have not the same intimate relations with one another, which the upper and lower Helderberg groups have, since these form two very distinct and natu- ral groups. The upper part of the Clinton group is very intimately rela- ted to the Niagara group, and the lower part with the Medina sandstone ; and, though treated as distinct in the State of New York, for reasons already given, it may hereafter be found best to unite the shaly and arena- ceous beds with those below into one group, while the calcareous portion may be included with the Niagara. This arrangement would be more natural than the present subdivision. We shall, in the first place, inquire into the relations which these groups have to those occupying the western and north-western States. I have already alluded to one of the most striking features of the geology of the west, namely, the almost entire absence of schistose and arenaceous deposit*, from the termination of the Potsdam sandstone, to the commencement of the shales and sandstones succeeding the corniferous limestone. The real and apparent importance of the calcareous deposits is much augmented, when we view the series as a whole. Looking to this fact, we expect to find the difficulty of recognizing the individual members considerably increased, since the intercalated masses of sandstone or shale often mark, in a con- spicuous manner, the line of separation of the two distinct deposits. It has already been shown, in the preceding pages of this report, that the lower sandstone of the Lake Superior district is a continuation of the Potsdam sandstone of New York, which has been traced, by the Canadian geologists, through Canada and along the northern shore of Lake Huron. This sandstone has been shown to dip beneath a series of calcareous beds in which we recognize, as shown above, the calciferous sandstone, the Chazy, the Birds-eye, the Black-river and Trenton limestones, charac- terized by the same fossils which they contain in New York. We have shown that these successive members of the series have greatly diminished in thickness, the entire vertical range being, at several points, less than one hundred feet. In tracing them across to the Mississippi river the same tenuity is observed in all the four limestones ; but the calciferous sandstone aug- ments in thickness till it acquires the same development which it has in New York. At the extreme westerly points where we have examined these limestones, we find that their lithological character has undergone an essen- tial change ; but this has been a gradual one, so that we have been able to trace its progress in our examinations from east to west, and recognize many of the characters which might otherwise have escaped our observation. The fossils, though diminished in numbers, are, for the most part, identical with those which we have everywhere learned to regard as characteristic of the different groups. Thus far we have had brought to our notice two or three important dif ferences in the succession of the rocks at the West and in New York. These are the alternation of the lower beds of the calciferous sandstone with the higher part of the Potsdam, by which several successive bands of Ex.\u2014 10"], [638, "[ 4 ] 290 greater or less thickness are presented near the line of junction ; farther, we have above the calciferous sandstone a bed of sandstone resembling the Potsdam, and which is from fifty to eighty feet thick. The occurrence of this bed, which I have indicated in the table above, shows that the causes which operated to give origin to the deposit of the Potsdam sandstone first became intermittent at the base of the calciferous, and then again became active after the final deposition of that rock. In addition to this, we have, succeeding the Trenton limestone, a thick-bedded, porous or cavernous, and usually friable limestone in which the great deposits of lead are sound. This rock, though included with the cliff limestone of the West, is now known to be a distinct member 01 lower Silurian age, and one which thus far we have not recognized in our New York series. To make up for the . diminished thickness of the Trenton and associated limestones in the West, we have this important and distinct mass, the geographical extent of which has not yet been fully determined. We next turn our attention to the Hudson-river group, under which term we include the Utica slate, the shales and sandstones' of Pulaski,* and the grey sandstone. In tracing this group towards the north-west, we find that the arenaceous beds gradually disappear ; the calcareous matter, on the other hand, gradually increases, forming with the argillaceous beds of marl, or, by itself, occasional bands of impure limestone. We are able to trace this group continuously as far as the shores of Lake Winnebago in a wes terly direction ; and, at the south-west, we find it in the vicinity of Cincin nati and extending into Indiana and Kentucky. Thus, the Hudson-river group of New York, by the accession of calcareous matter forming marls and thin-bedded limestones, has become the typical \" blue limestone and marls\" of Ohio and of the North and South-west. This term has been extended to include the representatives of the Chazy, Birds-eye, Black river and Trenton limestones, which appear about Frankfort in Kentucky, and again on the upper Mississippi.! I have already given the detail of the facts which prove the truth of this assertion. Of the Oneida conglomerate, we know nothing at the west. It is an important member of the New York series, and extends from thence south erly through New Jersey and Pennsylvania, forming a well-marked geologi cal horizon. The Medina sandstone has been traced to the north-west, through Canada ; and it may be possible that the green marly bed below the Clinton group, on Green bay, is the equivalent of that rock. Farther to the west, or south-west of the great Alleghany coal-field, it has not been recognized. The Clinton group is, for the greater part of its extent west of Lake Huron, merged in the Niagara group ; or, in other words, the calcareous portion is so intimately united with that of the Niagara, that the two are hardly to be distinguished. The shaly and arenaceous portions of this group appear only at rare intervals, and form no important feature in the geology of the western States. There, the Niagara and Clinton groups are not recognized as distinct from each other, but both form a part of the * These two are usually denominated the Hudson-river group, but since all those rocks along the valley of the Hudson river are more or less disturbed and metamorphosed, it is important to distinguish the individual members. Moreover, the four together form a natu ral group, which may either be studied as a whole, or, in favorable localities, in its indi vidual members. t The localities about Cincinnati do not expose strata below the age of the Hudson-river group, including the Utica slate."], [639, "291 1*1 \" cliff limestone,\" or \" upper magnesian limestone,\" so often spoken of, and which is one of the most prominent groups of the western states. This term, however, designates an extensive series of groups, since it includes the Galena limestone, the Clinton and Niagara limestones, (the shales and sandstones of the former group being absent), and the upper Helderberg limestones, all the intermediate groups being wanting in the states north ol the Ohio river. This will be better understood, perhaps, by the inspection of the follow ing table, in which the equivalency of the Cliff limestone with the New York groups is shown : Cliff Limestone. corniferous limestone.

Trenton limestone. ) The union of the Galena limestone with the cliff has been induced by the almost entire absence of the Hudson-river group, where the lead-bearing limestone occurs, and from the similarity of the latter to the Niagara. The Niagara group, in the form of a heavy-bedded limestone, can be recognized throughout all the western States, both to the north and to the south of the Ohio. The Onondaga salt-group and the lower Helderberg limestones have not been recognized in the States to the north of the Ohio ; nor has the Onondaga salt-group been observed to the south of that river. In Tennessee, the cliff limestone of Ohio is reduced in thickness and im- portance, and is nowhere recognized except as a single formation. Still, among its fossils are to be recognized many of those of the Niagara, and of the upper and lower Helderberg groups. Among the latter are Penta- merus galeatus, Spirifer macropleura, S. rugosus, and several species of Atrypa, which are known in New York only in the limestones of the lower Helderberg. This interesting fact is not to be lost sight of, for we shall have occasion again to refer to it. We perceive that, over all that area of the pal\u00e6ozoic ocean, now occupied by the States north of the Ohio, this important group of limestones is wanting. Their absence can only be accounted for by supposing, either that the bed of the ocean was so far elevated that no"], [640, "[4] 292 deposition could be made upon it ; or that it was so far depressed that its depth was too great to admit of the existence of corals and other marine animals with which they are associated, and the consequent production of calcareous deposits. Although represented in Tennessee, it is only by a few of the characteristic fossils, the formation not becoming one of import ance in the series. In numerous localities which have been examined, the upper Helderberg limestones rest upon the Niagara limestone, but are sometimes separated from it by a band of argillaceous limestone, which is, probably, an indica tion of the Onondaga salt-group. In some instances, there is evidence of a denuding action upon the surface of the Niagara limestone, previous to the deposition of the upper Helderberg limestones ; and we can suppose this to have occurred only in a shallow ocean. Whether this was the con dition of the ocean during all the intervening period, we cannot pretend to decide at present ; it seems not improbable, however, that, during the first part of the interval, the ocean was too deep to admit of the growth of animals ; and that, subsequently, or at the period of the Oriskany sand stone, its bed was elevated, and, after some slight oscillations, it remained at that uniform elevation over the entire area, thus admitting of the for mation of this extensive coral reef which marks the period of the upper Helderberg. The limestones of this period, either in their several parts, or as one rock, are recognized throughout the West and South-west, having everywhere an unmistakable character, and filled with the same fossils as in the state of New York. Of the groups above the corniferous limestone, which is the terminating rock of the upper Helderberg series, we have but a meagre representative in the States west of the Ohio river. Here, we know that some portions of the Hamilton, as also of the Portage and Chemung groups still remain, but they gradually die out in a westerly direction. In Canada West, and in the southern part of Michigan, the Hamilton group is well marked by many of its characteristic fossils. In many parts of Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky, the corniferous limestone is immediately succeeded by a black slate, the exact age of which may be regarded as undecided. It appears not to more recent than the Genessee slate, and we should expect to find some representation of the Portage and Chemung groups above it. Thus far, however, it is only in the lithological character of some of the shaly sandstones above this black slate, that we see any resemblance to these groups. The shales and the sandstones of the Catskill mountains, we know, have thinned out and disappeared before reaching the western part of New York ; and these have no representation at the west. Succeeding the black slate, however, there is a group of shales and sandstones which, from the fossils they contain, are regarded as belonging to the carboniferous period. This group is succeeded by the great limestone deposit, which is usually termed the carboniferous. Neither of these has as yet been satisfactorily recognized at the east. Thus far, up to the present time, having traced the actual continuation of the several rocks and groups to the westward, and perceiving the diffi culty which exists in determining in detail the parallelism of the different members of the pal\u00e6ozoic series, even where no ocean or mountain barrier exists, we shall be prepared to appreciate the obstacles in the way of arri ving at an exact parallelism of our series and those of Europe, separated"], [641, "293 [4] as they are by an intervening space of 3000 miles of ocean. In making any such comparison, it is highly important for us to possess a knowledge of the changes which take place in the nature of deposits which are abso lutely continuous, and strictly synchronous in their origin, having been deposited in the same ocean during the same period of time. We have an opportunity of comparing these in a country where there have been no dis turbances to produce faults, dislocations, foldings or metamorphism of the beds, and where the general elevation varies but a few hundred feet. Here there can be no mistake in the observations, and the conclusions drawn from them must be allowed to have great weight. We perceive that entire groups of strata are unrepresented at the West, since the species in the upper Helderberg limestones, where they rest upon the Niagara group at the West, are identical with those of the same rocks in New York, where they overlie the Oriskany sandstone. The very interesting species marking the period of the Hamilton group are entirely wanting in the western and south-western States, and we have very few representatives of those of the Portage and Chemung groups, and none at all of the Catskill mountain shales and sandstones. Such being the state of things at the West, it is easy to point out the line of demarcation between three or four groups, but this kind of grouping will not help us elsewhere. One of these groups which physically is a natural one in some parts of the country, contains fossils of three distinct periods, viz : the Niagara, the lower and the upper Helderberg. Were these ani mals living contemporaneously, or did they succeed each other in the order of time, as elsewhere shown ? And, if they thus succeeded each other, did the same interval elapse in those localities where they form one appa rent group, as in those places where each one is represented by a distinct geological formation and a fauna peculiar to itself? These are questions to be answered only after mature investigation ; they arise with others when we take into consideration our pal\u00e6ozoic series, in its entire geographical extent, and consider the varied phases which it displays over the space stretching from the Atlantic to the Mississippi, and from Alabama on the south to Lake Superior on the north. PARALLELISM OF THE PAL\u00c6OZOIC SERIES OF EUROPE AND AMERICA. The series of deposits which we have to consider lies between two well marked limits ; namely, the base of the pal\u00e6ozoic beds on one side and the period of the coal on the other. These two points are of equal import ance as geological horizons. On the continent of Europe and in the Uni ted States, there is little difference of opinion in regard to the point of the commencement of organic life. In England the question is not so well deter mined, and it is here that we need further information before we can make satisfactory comparisons. M. de* Vernueil has remarked* that one of the * I should not proceed farther without making due acknowledgment for the very lucid and philosophical memoir of de Verneuil upon the \"Parallelism of the Pal\u00e6ozoic formations of America with those of Europe.\" (Bulletin de la Soc. Geo. de France, Ser. II. T. IV. translated and published in Sill. Am. Jour., Series II. No. 14,) which has done more than all else to elucidate this subject. The paper by Mr. Sharpe on the \"Pal\u00e6ozoic rocks of North America,\" (Quar. Jour. Geol. Soc. London, Aug., 1848) is filled with valuable criti cal matter and affords useful hints upon the subject. M. Elie de Beaumont, in his \" Note sur les systemesde Montagnes les plus anciens de l'Europe,\" published in 1847, has also intro. duced the subject of parallelism in connexion with his views of mountain systems and theii epochs of elevation. Beyond these, we have our own papers on this subject, which were the results of observation* made ssveral year* since."], [642, "294 [4] principal difficulties, in the comparison between American and European systems is, that, in America, the series is more complete than in Europe. It cannot then be expected that we should find representatives for all our groups, but only for the most persistent of them. The very completeness of the pal\u00e6ozoic series in this country presents another difficulty, since it destroys those sharp lines of demarcation, and those wide and positive dis tinctions which are very conspicuous where many of the beds or groups composing the series are wanting. If there be any changes in the charac acter of the animals marking successive stages, then every later group is marked in some degree by these changes ; thus, the absence of any one or more of the intermediate groups leaves those on both sides in stronger con trast with each other. All the attempts to show that the parallelism of American and European pal\u00e6ozoic deposits have been with a view to find a correspondence with the European standard, where the series is confessedly incomplete, and where it has suffered, during its deposition or subsequent to it, many disturbances. In speaking in this manner, we do not mean to detract from the great merit of this standard of classification, the result of labors of which we, who study the various groups almost undisturbed, can have but little idea ; we mean only to claim for the most complete series, that one where physical and zoological characters are best developed, the preeminence which is due to it as the most perfect exponent of nature herself. It has been said that our groups are of very unequal importance ; but to this it may be remarked that it was not always possible to say what were and what were not impor tant groups. For example, the Niagara limestone, in its eastern extension, is only a few feet in thickness, and might well be united with the lower Hel derberg series, which are separated from it by less than twenty feet ; and these two groups were so united up to the year 1838 : but, following out these deposits in a westerly direction, the Niagara group expands to an important one, and the thin mass separating it from the lower Helder berg attains a thickness of a thousand feet. What are apparently unim portant beds, in one place, may become very important in another. It is, indeed, true that this attention to minor groups does diminish the value of the lines of division between the so-called systems ; thus, throughout New York, the line of separation between the Niagara and the lower Hel derberg limestone is as strongly marked as that between upper and lower Silurian, or that between the lower and upper Helderberg, which is now regarded as the line between the Silurian and Devonian. In this instance, we have no hesitation in saying, that the line of separation between two of the subordinate groups of a system is as well marked as that between the two divisions of that system into upper and lower, or between that system and the succeeding one. If it be argued that, in the South-west, these two groups of the lower Silurian system coalesce into one physical group, so also does the upper Helderberg (Devonian), coalesce equally with the other two, the whole forming but a single physical group. The Oriskany sand stone is often less than five feet in thickness, and yet it separates the lower and upper Helderberg limestones as effectually at those points, as where it is a thousand feet thick. The Marcellus shale, a subordinate member of the Hamilton group, is not more than one hundred feet thick, and still it contains a group of fossils specifically unlike all those in the succeeding rocks. It is certainly worthy of separation as a distinct member of the series, and its importance is likely to increase rather than to diminish. The"], [643, "295 [4] black slate of the western and south-western States, which immediately succeeds the corniferous limestone, has no greater thickness than the Mar cellus shale, and yet its importance is there fully acknowledged. It occu pies the interval between the corniferous limestone and the carboniferous sandstone, which, in New York, is filled by three distinct groups having a total thickness of little less than five thousand feet. A review of all the facts, and the conditions under which we find the successive groups developed, brings us back to our original conclusion, that, where the series is most complete, there will be recognized no lines of sys tems ; and that the whole series, from the commencement of organic exis tence to the period of the coal, is one system, composed of a series of de posits succeeding each other without those marked changes or intervals which have usually been considered to exist. LOWER SILURIAN GROUPS. The Potsdam sandstone, with its associated conglomerates and shales, which exist in some parts of the United States, lies at the base of the fos siliferous series. It has now been traced from Canada, west to the Mississippi river, and south-west to Alabama. This rock is represented in Russia by the beds containing Obolus and Lingula ; and in Scandinavia by sandstones, which rest unconformably on the gneissoid and schistose rocks, composing the azoic system. M. de Verneuil remarks : \" These are, in the two continents, the most ancient fossiliferous rocks ; and, when we reflect upon their antiquity, we are astonished to find a genus of shells in them which still appears in the existing creation, proving that the conditions of existence wTere not very different then from what they are at present.\" It is not yet certain that any beds exactly equivalent to this sandstone have been found in Great Britain, though it is not impossible that some of the beds in North Wales may be so. In the same connection we may include the calciferous sandstone, which does not appear to be recognized anywhere in Europe with the same distinctness as in America. The Chazy, Birds-eye, and Black-river limestones, which, in New York, form a group distinct from the Trenton limestone, are not very clearly re cognized in Europe. It is probable that some part of the Orthoceratite limestone of Sweden is the equivalent of the Black-river mass ; but we have no evidence, from fossils or otherwise, that there are any representatives of the twro lower rocks. I have shown that, cf the eighty-three species found in these lower limestones, four pass upwards into succeeding beds, two are doubtful, and seventy-seven are restricted to the group. Of this number of species, the Lifuites convolvans is the only one which I can consider as an European species ; the Ill\u00e6nus of she Chazy, which I regarded with doubt as J. crassicauda, being a vsry distinct species.* For these reasons I consider the limestones in question as having no representation among British strata ; and, if at all represented on the continent, it can be only in a very partial manner. The Trenton limestone, the Utica slate, and the Hudson-river group are represented in northern Europe by the Orthoceratite limestone of Sweden and Russia, and by the shales with Graptolites, which succeed to that lime stone. In Great Britain, the Llandeilo flags and Caradoc sandstone are Columnaria alvcolans of Gcldfuss is an American fossil."], [644, "[ 4 ] 296 clearly the equivalent of these groups. It is here that we first find a num ber of species identical with European ones, and which enable us to insti tute a comparison. It will be found, however, that the species in the Hudson-river group correspond most nearly with the European forms, and that it may be doubtful if the base of the Trenton limestone has been reached in Great Britain. I am quite aware of the opinion expressed by Mr. Sharpe, who speaks of the fossils of the Trenton limestone, Utica slate, Blue limestone of Ohio. Hudson-river group, as being, many of them, common to Europe, where they characterize the middle part of the lower Silurian system ; it must be recollected, however, that Mr. Sharpe includes in the lower Silurian series, the Grey sandstone, Oneida conglomerate, Medina sandstone, Clinton group. The three latter we cannot include withip the lower Silurian, for reasons elsewhere given ; but especially because, by thus doing, the line between the upper and lower Silurian would be drawn in the midst of species and types continuing upwards into the upper Silurian. We must also recollect that the larger part of Mr. Lyell's collection w^as made in western locali ties, and that he could not have had a fair representation' of the species of the Trenton limestone, as we know them in New York. I have now satisfied myself, from actual examination over many hun dred miles, that the blue limestone, as it appears at Cincinnati, is only the Hudson-river group ; and that the Trenton and other limestones, or their equivalents, lie below it. This opinion was published by me in 1841, and thouo-h I -was, at one time, disposed to modify it from the observations and published accounts of others, later examinations have confirmed me in my position. The argument of Mr. Sharpe, therefore, when we look at the facts, is strongly in favor of the view we have expressed ; for, taking away the three groups, as we are compelled to do, we show that the fossils he was examining were from the upper part of our lower Silurian series, and not from the middle. These correspond very well with the Caradoc sand stone, which, in its zoological character, is clearly the equivalent of our Hudson-river group.* In studying the fossils from the Trenton limestone, Utica slate and Hudson river group, (regarding the latter as composed of the Frankfort slate, the Pulaski shales and sandstones, and the gney sandstone,) I found, restricted to the Trenton limestone, one hundred and eighty-eight species ; and, beyond * There can be no longer any ground for sustaining the opinion of M. Elie de Beaumont, that the Caradoc is the equivalent of the Potsdam sandstone. This opinion I presume to have been formed from the erroneous views published in this country as to the position of the Potsdam sandstone with regard to the metamorphic slates and other schistose rocks of eastern New York and western New England. Since there is now but one opinion regard ing the age of these rocks, it is no longer necessary to offer any argument to prove their real position and relation to the Potsdam sandstono."], [645, "r, 29? [ 4 ] this number, twenty species common to the Trenton limestone and Hudson river group, and two species common to the Trenton limestone and the Utica slate. In the latter rock, I found eight species restricted to that rock, and three others occurring in both this rock and the Hudson-river group. In the latter group, fifty-four species are restricted to it, and there are twenty which are common to it and the Trenton limestone, and three common to it and the Utica slate. The list, given by Mr. Sharpe, of the European species found in \u25a0 these groups, is as follows : Lept\u00e6na alternata. Spirifer biforatus. depressa. imbrex. Terebratula bidentata. reticularis ? sericea. Strophomena grandis. Bellerophon bilobatua. Porcellia ornata. Orthis parva. testudinaria. Of these species every one, which is included in our list, is common to the Trenton and Hudson-river group, or restricted to the latter, as is the case with Terebratula bidentata* and Porcellia omala.i This does not reach the case ; and unless we have evidence that some small portion of this one hundred and eighty-eight species, restricted to the Trenton limestone, are identical with British species, we shall not feel disposed to admit that this period is there represented. It is probable, however, that the Llandeilo flags, and some associated limestones, may be the equivalent of this rock in the British isles. When we recollect that, according to Professor Sedg wick, all the bands of limestone in England, below the carboniferous series, are purely local phenomena, which appear only at intervals, we shall not be surprised to find that our lower Silurian limestones are not there repre sented by strata of the same lithological character. In comparing our fossils with those of Ireland, we find several species identical and others closely resembling those of the Trenton limestone. Among them may be named, Isotelus gigas ( which rarely occurs in the Hudson-river group), Ill\u00e6nus crassicauda, Phacops callicephalus, (allied to P. Dalmani), and, Lichas trentonensis (allied to Lichas (Nuttainia) hiber nica). We recognize in the fossils of this period some which are identical with those from Sweden and northern Europe. M. de Verneuil has indicated the following : Calymene Blumenbachii, (var. senaria.) C. Eischeri. Trinucleus caractaci. Orthoceras communis, or duplex. Lituites convolvans. C. punctata. Ill\u00e6nus crassicauda. Lichas laciniata. Bellerophon bilobatus. Spirifer lynx. Ceraurus pleurexanthemus. Phacops Dalmani. Orthis testudinaria. Verneuili. \u2022 Atrypa dentata, Hall. Pal. N.

Cyrtolites ornatus, Conrad."], [646, "[4] 298 These may be regarded as characteristic of the lower Silurian age in Europe and America. When we compare the formations given by Hisin- fer, and the lists of fossils under each, we can have no doubt but that we ave represented in the \" strata schisti argillacei\" and the \" strata schisti alumnaris,\" our Hudson-river group and Utica slate ; and that the \" strata calcarea antiquiora,\" with their numerous Trilobites and Orthoceratites, Orthis, &c, some of which are identical with our species, and many closely related in form, are equivalent to our Trenton limestone, with a meagre representation of the beds below. If the Orthoceratite limestone of Sweden extended into Great Britain, it seems scarcely possible that it should not have been recognized, since it contains an abundance of that remarkable form, the Endoceras, but a single one of which, Orthoceras bisiphonatum, is figured in Murchison's \"Silurian System,\" and this one is from the Caradoc sandstone. The fossils from the Llandeilo flags are, to so great an extent, identical with species from the Caradoc, that we cannot suppose these beds to extend below the horizon of the upper part of the Trenton limestone ; or, in the absence of the calcareous element, they may possibly hold the place of this limestone ; but of this we have no positive evidence, for the want of materials for comparison. In America, the Hudson-river group terminates the deposits of the lower Silurian period. The commencement of the succeeding period is marked by some great disturbance, which, though not visible in its effects upon the pre ceding beds, is indicated by the production of a coarse sandstone and con glomerate, spread widely over the deposits of a more quiet period. This reason alone might not be sufficient to induce us to draw the line of demar cation at this point ; but, in the fossiliferous beds succeeding this rock, we find ourselves in the midst of a fauna which is entirely new, or at least where preexisting forms are so rare and obscure that they are scarcely appreciable in our consideration of the whole. This entire change in the fauna is equally characteristic over large areas of country, where the sand stone before alluded to has not extended. The epoch of this conglomerate, however, was followed by alternate periods of disturbance and repose ; for we find, in the Medina sandstone, a vast accumulation of argillaceous mat ter mingled with the arenaceous deposits ; and, the Clinton group, whose organic remains become numerous, consists of shales, sandstones and con glomerates. At the commencement of this period, therefore, as at the beginning of the pal\u00e6ozoic epoch, we have the evidences of those distur bances which have charged the ocean with coarse materials, transported by violent currents, and spread widely over the bed of a previously quiet sea. The change in the fauna is equally conspicuous where the sandstone or conglomerate, which ushers in this period, does not exist, that is to say, at the West and North-west.* We have already shown this in tracing the formations from Drummond's island to the Mississippi river. If any further facts or arguments were needed to sustain this view, we have them in the fossils already described from the Clinton group of New York, which amount to more than one hundred species ; and we have not yet recognized five which are known in the lower Silurian rocks of America. *M. de Vernueil says, that near Galena, the line of separation is not so distinctly marked, and the magnesian limestone contains, at its base, the fossils of the lower Silurian period. We regard this as already sufficiently explained in what we have said of this lead-bearing or Galena limestone, which has heretofore been united with the cliff, or upper magne sian limestone, but which is decidedly separated from that, and is a lower Silurian limestone, which sufficiently accounts for its containing lower Silurian fossils."], [647, "299 [4] UPPER SILURIAN GROUPS. In the upper division of the Silurian system, we include the rocks from the Oneida conglomerate to the lower Helderberg limestone inclusive. Of these groups, the Clinton and Niagara have a very wide extension, as we have already shown, in a westerly and south-westerly direction, while the lower Helderberg limestones extend in a southerly direction, following the pal\u00e6ozoic deposits, and can be more or less distinctly recognized from New York to Alabama. The Clinton group, with its beds of Pentamerus oblongus, represents what in England is regarded as the upper part of the Caradoc sandstone ;* but we find it, not only above this well-marked horizon, which we have already indicated, but associated with numerous species of fossils, some of which are known as upper Silurian forms in Europe, and others pass into forms characteristic of the Niagara group in this country. The Niagara group, with its shale and limestone, would seem, at first view, to be the exact equivalent of the shale and limestone of Wenlock and Dudley in England, and of Gothland in Sweden, so numerous are the identical species in these groups ; but, on examination, we find that there are numerous species included in these rocks in Europe, which occur only in the lower Helderberg limestones, and which are separated from the Niagara by the enormous deposit of the Onondaga salt group. It is clear, therefore, that in the Wenlock formation of England, and its representatives in northern Europe, are included parts, at least, of two dis tinct groups in the order of time, \u2014 distinct both in their physical and zoological features ; and we cannot institute a proper comparison between the rocks of our own country and those of Europe, while we regard that as one group. The condition, both in England and on the continent, is doubtless similar to what we find in Tennessee and Virginia, where, from the absence of the intermediate groups, not only the Niagara and lower Helderberg are united together, but even the upper Helderberg limestones are superadded. M. de Verneuil regards the five inferior beds of the Helderberg as equiv alent to the Ludlow formation of England, and, at the same time recog nizes many Wenlock species among them. Mr. Sharpe remarks that \" a large proportion of their shells correspond with those of our Wenlock for mation, and there can be no doubt that they must be classed with that de posit.\" We certainly admit the propriety of recognizing these divisions \u2014 the Niagara on one side and the lower Helderberg on the other \u2014 as equiva lent to the Wenlock formation. Mr. Sharpe remarks, however, that, with these shells of the lower Helderberg, he finds some which have been re garded as Devonian, and mentions Orthis resupinata and a Productus, which we can only suppose to have found their way into this collection by accident.! We are not prepared to say what relation these five members, * It appears to me highly probable that the breccia and conglomerate of the upper part of the Caradoc may represent our Onondaga conglomerate, and there, as here, occupy a lower position than the Pentamerus beds. t It is true that there is, in the upper Pentamerus limestone of the lower Helderberg, an Orthis resembling O. resupinata, and another in the Delthyris shaly limestone, which bear some resemblance to that species ; both, however, are quite distinct. I have, in my own collection three different species from England and the continent, all under the name o1 O resupinata, but entirely distinct from each other ; and Mr. Sharpe will, I am sure, recog nize them as distinct, whenever he shall direct his attention to them. I have seen Products below the upper Helderberg limestone, wlere we know that it occurs."], [648, "[ 4 ] 300 forming the lower Helderberg group, bear to the Ludlow rocks ; but we know that few of the fossils are similar to those of that division, while many are identical with those of Wenlock and Dudley. We have yet seen no reason to change our opinion as to the similarity of the fossils of the upper Helderberg and Hamilton groups, with those of the Ludlow divi sion, though there are some very important and characteristic ones known only in the lower position. Among the species of the Niagara group, which are apparently identical with those of Wenlock and its equivalent on the continent, we may men- tion the following : Catenipora escharoides. Atrypa reticularis. Heliolites pyriformis, and allied imbricata ; or a closely allied species. species (Porites of Lonsdale). bidentata. Stromatopora concentrica. interplicata. Limaria fruticosa. cuneata. clathrata 1 brevirostris I Numerous bryozboid corals, plicatella 1 identical with Dudley species. aprina. Ichthyocrinus l\u00e6vis. Orthoceras imbrisatnm. Eucalyptocrinus decorus, and virgatuia. Cystide\u00e6 of closely allied forms. undulatnm. Orthis elegantula. Conularianiagarensis. (Compare with C.quad- hybrida. risulcata in Murchison's Sil. Syst.) Lept\u00e6na depressa. - Cybele punctata. transversalis. Ceraurus insignis. subplana ? \u2014 Orthis pecten ? Bumastis barriensis. Spirifer bilobus. Phacops linguhirns. sulcatus. Calymene Blumenbachii. crispus. Homalonotus delphinocephalus. radiatus (S. cyrt\u00e6na, Dal.) Proetus Stokesii, and species of Onchus. This list might be considerably extended, if we were to add species so closely similar to European forms, that there may still be some question as to their identity.* Remembering that, above this group, we have the Onondaga salt gioup, which, in its greatest development, is one thousand feet thick, we turn to the next succeeding, or lower Helderberg group. In this group we recognize : Orthis pisum, a species closely allied to 0. by- Atrypa tumida ? brida. AVilsoni ? A species allied to 0. hybrids. Stricklandi ? A species allied to 0. elegantula. Pentamerus galeatus. 0. orbicularis. Avicula navil'orniis. Lept\u00e6na depressa. Bellerophon profundus, allied to B. dilatatru. Spirifer various, allied to S. tilobus. Phacops Hausmanni. Spirifer, two species resembling S. crispus, Homalonotus ? allied to H. delphino- and S. sulcatus, but much larger. cephalua. Atrypa reticularis. Acidaspis ? * In this list I have included none which are restricted to the Clinton group."], [649, "301 [ 4 ] The number of species identical with European forms will doubtless be much increased, when a critical comparison shall have been made of all the specimens we now possess from this group ; and, even at the present time, the list of allied species might be considerably increased, if it were desira ble to do so. Among those enumerated, not one is known in the Niagara group, and among them are Phacops Hausmanni and Pentamerus galeatus, which are w-ell-known European species of the age of the Wenlock divi sion. Among the corals are numerous forms closely allied to the Niagara species ; but they have not yet been fully compared with those of Europe. To show still farther that these are distinct zoological groups, I may mention, that three hundred and twenty species have been described from the Clinton and Niagara groups ; and among more than two hundred known species of the lower Helderberg, I have not recognized a single one identi cal with those of the Niagara group. Again, the Niagara and Clinton groups extend from New York far to the westward, everywhere recognized by their physical and zoological characters ; while to the north of the Ohio, we do not recognize the lower Helderberg limestones, beyond the central part of New York. These two groups, from the thinning of the Onondaga salt group, approach within a few feet of each other along the base of the Helderberg, but, nevertheless, continue far to the south-west, separated by a remnant of the Onondaga salt group, till at last this disappears, or is no longer recognized. In the comparison, therefore, with European groups of upper Silurian age, we find that our Clinton group is merged, by European writers, in the lower Silurian period ; the Medina sandstone, on the other hand, appears not to be recognized ; or, if existing in any form, is classed with the prece ding. The Onondaga salt group is not represented in Europe, and the Niagara group and lower Helderberg limestones, which exist there only partially developed, are merged in one, while, in the United States, they mark two important epochs in the upper Silurian period. That this is the true state of the case we feel the more confident, inasmuch as it is analo gous to what we find to be true in this country. GROUPS ABOVE THE LOWER HELDERBERG. Turning our attention to a comparison of the divisions succeeding the lower Helderberg, we first meet with the Oriskany sandstone and Cauda galli grit. The former has no great thickness in New York, but acquires a greater development in Pennsylvania and Virginia. It has, however, entirely thinned out in western Tennessee and is nowhere met with in the States west of the Appalachian chain. This rock, however, is geologically of great importance ; for, along the Atlantic slope it forms a very prominent dividing line between limestone series which, in their physical aspect, are very similar to each other. In its organic contents it contrasts strongly with the rocks which have preceded it. Although in many places super imposed directly upon the upper Pentamerus limestone, yet, the moment we enter it, we discover that we have left all those forms which were charac teristic of the strata below. In its prominent and abundant fossils it has almost as little connection with the succeeding fossiliferous rocks as with those below. The production of this rock undoubtedly marks a period of physical dis turbance, which resulted in the formation and distribution of this detrital"], [650, "[ 4 ] 3( 2 matter. It appears to have been only in remote parts, or in those points distant from the source of this deposit, that organic beings flourished in any considerable numbers. The succeeding deposit, which is a detritus of gritty material, both argillaceous and arenaceous in its character, is very limit ed in its extent, and contains scarcely a vestige of organic life, while the fossils of the preceding division are entirely cut off by it. From all that we have been able to learn, these two rocks are not rep resented in Europe, or at least they have not been recognized as of any geological importance. The Oriskany sana stone, however, marks an impor tant horizon, since we now regard it as commencing the Devonian period. In Europe, and more particularly in Great Britain, the limits between Silu rian and Devonian have not been clearly traced; since we observe many disputed species, and others which are said to pass from one system into the other. A farther comparison of specimens shows us, that, though specifi cally distinct, many of the Oriskany sandstone species possess peculiari ties not noticed in those of lower groups, but which are characteristic in the higher ones. DEVONIAN SYSTEM. With this preliminary notice, we enter upon the consideration of the rocks which are regarded as forming the equivalent of the Devonian sys tem in Europe, excluding the two just mentioned, which are not recognized there either by their physical or zoological characters. These are the Schoharie grit ; the Onondaga and Corniferous limestones, which are inti mately connected by their fossils ; the Marcellus shale ; the Hamilton, Por tage and Chemung groups, together with the sandstones of the Catskill mountains. We have already shown how far these can be recognized at the West and South-west, and it remains to consider how far they are rep resented in Europe by the groups kown as Devonian, It has been a difficult point to fix the lower limit of the Devonian system in the United States. We were able to recognize the extension of the series equivalent to the Wenlock formation, as high as, and including, the lower Helderberg limestones, of which we have been speaking ; but we were unable to find beds corresponding to the Ludlow rocks, unless by including those groups which were much higher up in the series ; in fact, by taking into the classification the Hamilton group. The large number of forms figured in Murchison's \" Silurian System\" from the Ludlow beds, and which can nowhere be recognized, even in their analogues, below the Oris kany sandstone, convinced us of the impropriety of including the upper Helderberg and Hamilton groups in this part of the Silurian series ; nor have we yet seen sufficient reason to change this opinion. If the Devonian system is so extended as to include all the groups alluded to, then it must also include some of those beds heretofore referred to the Ludlow rocks. We think that this argument has some force, from the fact that in the coun try where this system was first promulgated, no less than twenty species are described from the rocks of Devonshire which had been previously des cribed by Murchison in his \" Silurian System,\" and nearly all of them from the Ludlow beds ; giving more than twenty-five per cent, of all the Lud- low species, exclusive of fishes, which are not included in the enumeration. This number, moreover, amounts to ten per cent, of all the Devonian fossils described by Phillips. We say, without fear of contradiction, that there is"], [651, "303 [4] no such mingling of species, no such passage from one group to another on the American continent, even among the most insignificant of the New York subdivisions. More than this, it seems unphilosophical to separate rocks into different systems, when so great a similarity of organic life is shown. It may seem presumptuous, for one not having been on the ground, to offer remarks thus opposed to the conclusions of eminent English geologists, but before the appearance of the \" Pal\u00e6ozoic fossils of Devonshire,\" we had in this country, as we supposed, been able to recognize something like the equivalent of the Ludlow series, and the species present themselves to us still in the same light. If the relation of the Ludlow rocks to the Devo nian system is clearly made out, and they are shown to constitute an inter mediate group, then we must of course' admit that there is an important hiatus in our series ; but until this is done, we are willing to believe that it is more perfect than that of other parts of the world. Before proceeding farther, we will devote a few lines to fossils of the Ludlow beds, as figured in the plates of Murchison's \" Silurian System.\" Lituites Biddulphii (Sil. Syst. p. 211, Fig. 8). \u2014 We have in the Scho harie grit fragments of a fossil scarcely distinguishable, in any respect, from the one figured ; covered, moreover, with the minute Spirorbis tennis, as in the Ludlow specimens. In the same association is another species quite similar to Lituites articulatus, and numerous others of this peculiar type of fossils, which we know in no other rock. Fragments of other chambered shells, referred to Phragmoceras, are also found in the Schoharie grit. In the same rock we have the Calymene platys of Green, which is indistin guishable from C. Blumenbachii, var. major of Murchison. It is only in a higher position, principally in the Hamilton group, that we find Loxone ma nexilis, and forms like Modiola semisulcata, Cypricardia solenoides, Cardiola fibrosa, Cypricardia amygdalina, C. undata, (which is of the type of many of our Hamilton forms, and clearly belongs to the same ge nus, Grammysia), and C. cymb\u00e6formis (a decided Hamilton form). Among the Orthoceratites we find such forms as 0. ibex and O. articula tum, and I might go on to increase the list, were it necessary. There is not, in the whole series of illustrations, any which strike us more forcibly than those just cited, since they are, if not positively identical, at least closely allied species. Prof. Phillips's list of the Devonian fossils includes the following species, described by Murchison as characteristic of the Ludlow or upper Silurian series : Cypricardia impressa ? Nucula (Cncnll\u00e6a) ovata. Orthis semicircnlaris. ' compressa. Loxonema sinuosa. Bellerophon trilobatus. Orthoceras ludense. imbricatum. ibex. Brontes signatus. Turbinolopsis bina. elongata. Cyathophyllum turbinatnm. Favosites polymorpha. gothlandica. spongites. fibrosa. Stromatopora concentrica. Fullastra? complanata. Cypricardia (Modiola) semisulcata. It is certainly not a little remarkable that so many Silurian fossils should pass upwards into the Devonian system, a case quite unexampled with us"], [652, "[4] 304 even among groups of the same system, and what we cannot conceive of as occurring in different ones. We will next turn to the American species identified with Devonian forms in Europe. Mr. Sharpe, in his paper, cites the following species from the Oriskany sandstone, Cauda-galli grit and Schoharie grit, as identical with European forms, viz : Spirifer arenosus, Urii, Terebratula reticularis ; and from the Onondaga and Corniferous limestones, Lept\u00e6na depressa, Orthis resupinata, Terebratula reticularis. We have not had the good fortune, personally, to see Spirifer Urii m so low a position. S. arenosus is a characteristic species of the Oriskany sandstone. Terebratula reticularis is a species which passes from the Clin ton to the Chemung group, and is worthless, simply as a species, in identi fying strata. Lept\u00e6na depressa passes from lower Silurian beds to the corniferous limestone inclusive, and must stand in the same category with the preceding. Orthis resupinata can be of no value till its character or geological range is defined ; and we are thus reduced to a single identical species. We would ask, whether all those ' remarkable forms from the Schoharie grit, so much like those of the lower Ludlow, and numerous others of the corniferous limestone, equally peculiar and characteristic, are to pass un noticed, as of no value in the determination of strata, while a few forms, whose geological range is indefinite, are made to decide the question of parallelism ? In the Marcellus shale, Hamilton group, Tully limestone, and Genessee slate, Mr. Sharpe identifies the following species as European : Avicula Boydii. quadrula. Athyris concentrica. lamellosa. Orthis Michelini.* cximia I opercularis. Strophomena Sharpel. Spirifer TJrii. macronotus. Productus fragaria ? scabriculus 1 Terebratula reticularis. aspera. borealis. \u2014 nucula ? Orthoceras articulatum ? In the Chemung group, the same author recognizes as European species : Avicula Boydii. Damnoniensis I Athyris concentrica. Strophomena umbraculum ? Spirifer TJrii. aperturatus. Productus plicatilis? fragaria ? Terebratula reticularis. aspera. borealis. nucula ? \u2022 Orthis Michelini does not occur in the Hamilton group of New York."], [653, "305 [4] The whole number of species being twenty-one, of which eight are doubt fully identified, and one (0. Michelini) not identified ; and from the num ber remaining we may subtract Terebratula reticularis, for reasons before given. With this evidence alone, we do not consider that the parallelism of the groups enumerated with those of England can be regarded as posi tively established ; for we believe that a complete collection of our fossils from the lower members of this division would offer stronger proof of their identity with the Ludlow rocks. It is probable, however, that there are other circumstances, of which we are ignorant, which led Mr. Sharpe to this conclusion; for, upon similar grounds, we have a right to conclude that the Ludlow and Devonian rocks of England are equivalent, since they con tain fully an equal number of identical species. If such a group as the Ludlow, divisible into upper and lower, separated by a limestone like the Aymestry limestone, does exist as distinct from the Devonian system, it presents a remarkable anomaly in the series, in containing so many species which are identical with, and so many which are similar to, those of the Devonian system. It should be observed that the species cited by Mr. Sharpe are, with one exception, from the Hamilton and Chemung groups, and that at least seven of the number are of those which pass from one group into the other. The number, all together, is less than one-twentieth of the whole ; and the other nineteen-twentieths, which are the most characteristic of the group, are not taken into consideration in the comparison. The arguments of M. de Verneuil, in favor of placing all these groups in parallelism with the Devonian of Europe, are certainly very satisfactory, after we have once admitted the principles advanced in the outset ; but, at the same time, it appears that the question of the Ludlow series is left un determined. They have, in England, a group of shales and flags with earthy limestone \u2014 a limestone of importance \u2014 and this again succeeded by soft, micaceous, thin-bedded, greenish-grey sandstones, the whole having a thickness of two thousand feet, which it seems difficult to recognize, even on the continent of Europe. This author regards it as incontestible, that the red sandstone of the Catskill mountains is upon the same horizon as the old red sandstone of Scotland and Wales ; that the Chemung, and Portage groups, the Genes see slate, the Tully limestone and Hamilton group represent the series of the Eifel, and of Devonshire ; and that the Marcellus shales are equivalent to those of Wissenbach, in the Duchy of Nassau. The Onondaga and corniferous limestones, he places in the same horizon as the inferior part of the Eifel and the Harz ; while the Oriskany sandstone is regarded by him as equivalent to the fossiliferous schists upon the borders of the Rhine. Following the views of this author, the presence of the genera Productus, Goniatites, Nautilus, Pentremiles, and the larger ganoid fishes, like Astero lepis and Holoptychius, constitute characters which are unmistakably Devo nian. We are not aware of the appearance of Productus and Pentremi tes, before the period of the corniferous limestone ; Goniatites and Nau tilus follow in the Marcellus shales ; while the first fish, of the character specified, is found in the Schoharie grit. Following this view, we have, from the corniferous limestone onward, the combination of types required to characterize the Devonian system ; that is to say, \u2014 we have a single spe cies of Pentremites and one of Productus, in the corniferous limestone ;"], [654, "[4] 306 and two of the latter and two of the former in the Hamilton group, where they are associated with Goniatites. Leaving, for the present, any criticism upon the zoological value of these types, we would merely remark that the advent of Productus and Pentrem ites is what might have been anticipated, and is only another stage in the developement of types existing in the Silurian period. Of Nautilus and Goniatites, we have, at present, less positive information ; but it seems to us that the peculiar Cephalopods, at the base of the upper Helderberg, are a link in the series, which it is necessary to consider before introducing the Goniatites. The rocks, from the Oriskany sandstone upwards, form three very natu ral physical groups, which, to a greater or less degree, are marked by their peculiar fossils. These physical groups would give the Helderberg lime stone as the lowest ; the Hamilton group, including the Marcellus and Genessee shales, for the second ; and the Chemung, including the Portage group as an enormous development of beds of passage, for the third. The American fossils, recognized by de Verneuil as identical with Euro- pean species, are : Terebratula reticularis. aspera. concentrica. Spirifer mucronatus. macropterus. cultrijugatus. heteroclitus. Verneuili. Orthis striatula. umbonata. crenistria. Lept\u00e6na depressa. Dutertrii. laticosta. Chonetes nana. Productus subaculeatus. Favosites gothlandica. Porites interstincta. Stromatopora concentrica. Pleurodyctium problematicum. Holoptychius nobilissimus. Dendrodus, teeth of. Asterolepis. Phacops macrophthalmus. Cryph\u00e6us calliteles, Goniatites retrorsus. Bellerophon striatus. Murchisonia bilineata. Chemnitzia nexilis. Avicula Damnoniensis. Pterinea fasciulata. Modiola squamifera. Inoceramus chemungensis. Cardium loricatum. Lucina proavia. rugosa. Grammysia hamiltonensis. Sanguinolaria dorsata. Terebratula cuboides. The greater part of these species have been recognized on the continent of Europe, and among them are only four or five which are included in the lists given by Mr. Sharpe. Still, it does not appear to us that the Scho harie grit, the Onondaga and the corniferous limestones are equally well represented with the groups above them. The fossils cited from the Scho harie grit are a species of Asterolepis? Calymene Blumenbachii? Pha cops macrophthalmus and Modiola squamifera ? Of these C. Blumenbachii is a distinct species peculiar to this rock, the C. platys of Greene already alluded to ; the Phacops is not P. macrophthalmus, but a very distinct spe cies, having a row of spines along the axis ; so that certainly no more than two species are identified."], [655, "307 [4] The species of the Onondaga and corniferous limestones are : Phacops macrophthalmus. Bellerophon striatns. Chemnitzia nexilis. Murchisonia biUneatns. Lucina proavia. rugosa. Terebratula reticularis. aspera. Terebratula concentrica. Spirifer mucronatus. cultrijugatus. heteroclites. Lepteena depressa. Catenipora escharoides. Stromatopora concentrica. From this list we exclude the two last entirely, since they are not known in these beds ; and, if occurring, they would prove nothing, since they are Silurian species. Terebratula reticularis and Lept\u00e6na depressa are also Silurian species, and of little value for the purposes of identification. Pha- cops macrophthalmus is equally common in the Hamilton group ; and Che- mnitzia nexilis, Terebratula aspera, T. concentrica and Spirifer mucro- natus, are comparatively very rare in these limestones, and only reach their maximum in the Hamilton group. Therefore, we must still regard these three calcareous deposits as but meagrely represented in the Devonian sys- tem on the other side of the Atlantic. In fact, we are unable to see, after all, any greater similarity to the Devonian than they have to the Ludlow series ; and the number of species here cited from these two members of the upper Helderberg, wdlich pass upwards into the Hamilton group, is not so great as the number of Ludlow species which rise into the Devonian of Eng- land, according to the authorities here cited. We perceive here, as in the lists cited from the memoir of Mr. Sharpe, that there are comparatively very few Devonian species below the Ham- ilton group, and that these are by no means characteristic forms. Although we admit the conclusions of M. de Verneuil in general, yet we are still una- ble to appreciate the evidence which would place all these deposits in par- allelism with the Devonian of Europe. In a westerly direction, the upper Helderberg group, composed chiefly of the Onondaga and corniferous limestones, is continuous as far as the Mis- sissippi river. Of the sedimentary formations succeeding these, all have disappeared save a black shale, which may be a representation of the Genessee slate of New York, but which holds the place of the Marcellm\". shale, resting directly upon the corniferous limestone. The green shales and yellow sandstones of Ohio and Indiana, which sue ceed this black shale, have been recognized as carboniferous by their fossils, though there is still some doubt whether the lower part may not represen- the Chemung group of New York ; at least their connection with the groups below has not been fully shown. In these states, therefore, the equivalent of the Devonian of Europe is to be found in these limestones and the black shale immediately overlying them. This limestone is more uniform in its character than perhaps any other of the groups, and it is _ every where marked by numerous characteristic fossils. On the Mississippi river, we find that the shales and sandstones between this group and the great carboni ferous limestone have entirely thinned out, leaving the latter rock resting directly upon the limestones of the upper Helderberg. The contrast between the divisions of this period, at the East and the West, will be made more intelligible by a tabular comparison."], [656, "14] 308 Black Slate of the West.

Upper Helderberg Series, including Shelly limestone and upper coralline limestone, (upper part of cliff limestone), continuous with the Onondaga and corniferous lime- stones of New York. Corniferous limestone, Onondaga limestone, Schoharie grit. Before concluding our remarks upon the parallelism of these several groups with the Devonian system of Europe, we will examine, for one mo ment, the zoological evidence. The occurrence of Productus, Pentremi tes, Mautilus, Goniatites and the scales of ganoid fishes are regarded as showing the parallelism of these deposits with those of Europe. In the first place, Productus, as now restricted, includes Brachiopods of a pecu liar type, not known before the period of the Helderberg rocks. Lept\u0153na, which, till recently, has been included in the same genus, is the earliest representation of the type ; Chonetes is another form, coming in only at the upper Silurian period, and at about the same time Strophodonta, both forms making a nearer approach to Productus proper ; and, after the lapse of these periods, the genus appears precisely in accordance with a law which has operated upon all the types from the beginning. Pentremi tes, as now constituted, includes some four or five distinct genera ; but the type of this genus appears in upper Silurian rocks. This genus, like Pro ductus, is par excellence, a carboniferous form ; both appearing in small numbers and with few species during the Devonian period. The Goniatites appear, for the first time, in the Marcellus shales, associated with a nauti loid form, the Discites of M'Coy ? In the black shale of the West, other species of Goniatites occur. Now, as all these genera, in their most perfect development, are the ac knowledged types of the carboniferous period, the inquiry naturally sug gests itself, whether, at any point of time, or at any horizon in the series of deposits after the appearance of these genera, we can draw the limit be tween Devonian and carboniferous. If the advent of these forms is of im portance enough to be regarded as the commencement of a system, we can conceive of no law, in the progress of these developments, which will per mit us to draw any line separating the strata in which they predominate in to two systems. If they are important, when occurring in small numbers, as characterizing the Devonian system, they are certainly as important when they become developed in greater numbers and more perfect forms. We have a right to contend, therefore, for the existence of the carboniferous system at any point where we can find a continuation of the genera Pen tremites, Productus, Goniatites (Cyrtoceras, Discites), Mautilus, and the ganoid fishes. I contend that this is the legitimate conclusion, or else the"], [657, "309 s 4 ] carboniferous system is subordinate to the Devonian. We characterize Devonian rocks by the presence of these fossils ; how shall we character ize the lower members of the carboniferous, except by the same genera ? If we decide that certain species, or certain peculiarities of species, imply the existence of the carboniferous, are we not making it a subordinate sys tem or group, since it is by these characters that we everywhere distinguish our subordinate groups ? If we would establish groups or systems on zoo logical characters, then we are bound to maintain the principle with which we set out. It appears to me that we have regarded certain systems as es tablished, and their limits as fixed, more from habit than from any express ed principle ; and that we consider a certain association of species even of more importance than the advent of new types. I have already shown that many of the Ludlow species of Murchison are very similar to, and others identical with, species from our higher groups ; and this similarity might even be traced much farther. It is true, moreover, that, in the \" Pal\u00e6ozoic Fossils of Devonshire,\" a number of Ludlow fos sils are cited, equal in number and importance to those cited from Amer ican rocks, to prove their identity with the Devonian of England. In the paper of M. de Verneuil, a larger number of species, and some of them of more important forms are cited ; but we still find the serious objection which we have just mentioned. This would be made more apparent if we wrere to compare more fully our species with European forms. We will take, for example, the Marcel lus shale, in which we have a beautiful group of Cephalopoda. Among them we have a species undistinguishable from the Discites planotergatus of M'Coy, a carboniferous fossil. Associated with this are forms very similar to Discites castellatus, Temnocheilus coronatus, and Goniatites sph\u00e6roidalis, with Orthoceratites &c, of the same author, and all from the same member. Now, even admitting that they are only similar species, and not positively identical, still it seems to us that this is too remarkable a combination to admit of the rocks in which they occur being very widely separated in point of time. Animals of this class have not often lived through more than a single growth, and, so far as we know, in our pal\u00e6o zoic series, are very reliable guides.* In the Hamilton group we have a Ptntremites of the form of P. floreales, a carboniferous fossil. We might mention a considerable number of Aceph ala, in the same group, having close relations with carboniferous forms of Europe. We have, in the Chemung group, numerous species of Pecten and closely allied genera, which are scarcely distinguishable from those of the carboniferous period of Europe. The Holoptychius is rather a carboni ferous than a Devonian type, though H. nobi/issimus belongs to the latter system.! In the black shale of Rockford, Indiana, a few feet above the cornife rous limestone, the Goniatites rotatorius and G. princeps have been found. These are carboniferous species of Europe, and indicate to us the same ho rizon in America. What arguments shall we offer in explanation of these * Brachiopoda have been the most enduring forms, and have often passed through seve ral geological divisions. Acephala appear to be next in the order of persistence ; and after them the Gasteropoda, while the Crinoids have rarely lived beyond the group in which they first appear. t I might here mention the fact, that Prof. Agassiz informed me, a few months since, he had seen, from the limestone of Columbus, Ohio, (corniferous limestone,) the tooth of a fish, which he had heretofore regarded as being a carboniferous genus."], [658, "310 [4] facts, but that, in the carboniferous system of Europe, have been included, not only types and genera, but even species which began their existence at about the period of our Marcellus shale ? How shall we be able to bring these deposits into parallelism, without bringing down the limits of the carboniferous to this horizon ? We have already, as we think, given sufficient evidence in the number of identical fossils, to show the equivalency of certain of our divisions, as far as the lower Helderberg limestones, which we place in parallelism with the Wenlock shales. We cannot agree with M. de Verneuil in placing them in parallelism with the Ludlow, for we have scarcely a single identi cal species of any importance, nor even analogous types. Leaving out of consideration the Oriskany sandstone and Cauda-galli grit, we feel disposed to regard the Schoharie grit as possessing zoological features more in ac cordance with those of the lower Ludlow series than any other rock in our classification, and we shall thus place it for the present. In reference to the identity of groups above the lower Helderberg series, it is impossible to place our rocks in any distinct parallelism with those of Europe ; since the published works of European writers represent a gradual passage of one system into another, and a want of well-defined limits, either by physical or zoological characters. It should not, however, be understood from this, that the equivalents of the European systems do not exist with us. What we would say is this: that, so long as the Ludlow group and its subdivisions are maintained, to gether with a Devonian and a carboniferous system and their subdivisions, we can never reconcile our series with those of Great Britain or the conti nent of Europe. If those divisions and subdivisions do not exist, and the identification of the groups above this with the Devonian system be sus tained, then we have an important hiatus to fill above the lower Helder berg limestone, which is unquestionably the place of the Ludlow deposit Should we ever be able to fill this gap, we are but at the commencement of the difficulty. In the first place, we find in the Schoharie grit, as already cited, numerous forms closely resembling those of the Ludlow beds. In the Hamilton group we find others, of which the bivalves resemble, or are iden tical with those of the upper Ludlow. The numerous species of obliquely cingulated shells, such as are figured in the geological survey of Great Britain, (Vol. II. Part I., Plates 17 and 18, together with such forms as are represented on Plates 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23,) are not to be found in our series, except in the Hamilton group and the associated strata. We have therefore to reconcile in some way all these apparent discrepan cies and real difficulties, before we can proceed one step beyond the lower Helderberg limestones. It is true, that, in the sandstone of the Catskill mountains, we have the remains of Holoptychius Dendrodus and other fishes of Devonian types ; and, as already remarked, the higher groups cor respond with the Devonian of Europe ; thus, were it not for the previous difficulty in recognizing the Ludlow series, together with another which now appears, we could feel some security in the conclusion that this part of our series corresponds to the Devonian of Europe. But here we are met by the difficulty of accounting for carboniferous types which, according to the present views of pal\u00e6ontologists, disappear here ; and not only the types, but numerous identical species. I have already given a list of species which are recognized by Professor Phillips as common to the Ludlow and Devonian beds ; and when we exam-"], [659, "311 [4] ine farther among published species, we find numerous Devonian types among the carboniferous strata, as shown by the list given below, which is only from a single work.

Trans. II. ser. vol. 5). Those thus marked (t*) were first described by Sowerby in the Geological Transactions cited above, and also recognized by Phillips in his \" Pal\u00e6ozoic Fossils.\" S, D, and C, or either of these letters, denote that the species belong also to the Silu rian, Devonian or Carboniferous. The entire number of Devonian species, here recognized as passing up wards into carboniferous strata, is one hundred and twenty-five. This is nearly half of the whole number published by Professor Phillips in his \" Pal\u00e6ozoic Fossils of Devonshire and Cornwall.\" Of the entire number, however, eleven are species published in the paper of Sedgwick and Mur chison before cited, and which are not included in the work of Professor Phillips. If we now take from the remaining Devonian fossils, the Ludlow and other Silurian species, the list is still further reduced by some twenty species ; thus more than one-half the number of fossils described in the above-mentioned work of Professor Phillips, are found to occur in Silurian and carboniferous strata ; and the small number of restricted species reduces the importance of the system to the value of some of our subordinate groups. Let us next compare the proportion of so-called Devonian species in the \" Synopsis of the Carboniferous fossils of Ireland.\" This work embraces descriptions of about nine hundred species, of which, as just remarked, one hundred and twenty-five have been recognized in Devonian and older de posits. This gives, of the whole number of species, between thirteen and fourteen per cent, as belonging to the older divisions. In the Brachiopoda of the work there is a still larger proportion, or sixty-three species, which is about twenty-six per cent, of the whole, chiefly in* the Devonian system. Among the corals there are twenty-four species, or about twenty-three per cent, of the whole ; and among the Crinoids, ten species, or about twenty"], [661, "313 [ 4 ] per cent, of Devonian and Silurian species. This last fact is of high im- portance ; since, of all our fossils, the Crinoids are among those which are the most restricted in their range. The proportion of species here represented, as passing from Devonian to carboniferous, is so enormously great, that we find no parallel to it in any preceding period. It is even nearly twenty times greater than the propor- tion of lower Silurian species now known in the upper Silurian groups of North America, and in the same proportion more than are common to the two divisions of the upper Silurian. We are even prepared to say, that the subordinate members of the Hamilton group do not present an equal num- ber of species passing from one to the other. We will go further and say, that, if the Hamilton group, as it exists in the State of New York, were broken up, and a space twenty-five miles in width to the east of Cayuga lake were metamorphosed so as to obliterate the fossils, the eastern and wes- tern portions would scarcely present an equal proportion of identical fossils, with the Devonian and carboniferous systems of Europe, as shown in the works above cited. If, therefore, physical conditions have wrought out such changes in the fauna of a particular period, in the space of three hun- dred miles, in what we know to be a continuous formation, we are certainly warranted in believing that changes as great as these may have occurred elsewhere.* The arenaceous and argillaceous deposits, which we trace uninterruptedly over so wide an area, and which present to us such gradual and almost im- perceptible changes in the fauna when studied continuously, would, if bro- ken up and isolated so that they could not be traced consecutively, present the same phases which are exhibited by the systems in Europe to which they are related. From all these facts there seems to be but one conclusion, and that is, in the British islands particularly, either there are remarkable exceptions to the general law in the continuation of species from one to another, or that there is no foundation for a distinction between the Devonian and carboniferous systems. We are quite aware of the objections which may be offered to these argu- ments ; but, before we can admit them, we must inquire on what principle have the systems of our pal\u00e6ozoic strata been established ? We hailed with gladness the promulgation of the \" Silurian System,\" which developed from * Referring to the paper of Mr. Sharpe before alluded to, we find the greater part of the spe- cies cited from the Hamilton andChemung groups to be Brachiopoda, which, particularly in the Hamilton group, occur in the western division, while they are few and comparatively rare, in the eastern part ofrtie Stute of New York. Of the list of species from this group, I find Avirula Boydii, A. yuadrula, Atrypa nucida and Orthoccras articulatum, (one-fourth of the whole) identical with Ludlow species. The Avicula and other Lamellibranchiata are abun- dant in the Hamilton group in the eastern part of the State of New York, and compara- tively rare in the western part. Now in Mr. Sharpe's table of species common to the two countries, we find among the Lamellibranchiata, Avicula, of which there are seventeen spe- cies in Mr. Lyell's collection: of these, fourteen are placed under the head of Devonian, and recognized as identical with European species there occuring, while two of these are Ludlow species. Again, under Cypricafdia, there are nine species in the collection, of which one is recognized as identical with a European species. Under the head of sundry genera, we find, in the same list, twenty-five species indicated as contained in the collection, of which not one is recognized as European. These twenty-five species are Lamellibranchiata, from the eastern part of the Hamilton group, and are of those very characteristic forni3 before noticed, which have a greater analogy\" with fossils of the Ludlow rocks than with any other. It is worthy of notice, that of forty-eight species of this family, placed by Mr. Sharpe under the head of the Devonian system, four only have been recognized as identical with European species ; and of these four, two from the Hamilton group are identical with Ludlowspecies."], [662, "[ 4 j 314 chaos and uncertainty that beautiful system, marked both by physical and zoological characters. The Devonian system came to us far less distinctly marked either by its physical or zoological features ; for, on the one side it was clearly and unequivocally related to the Ludlow rocks of the Silurian system ; and, on the other, as intimately connected with the carboniferous, by its zoological characters. In the great development of strata holding this place in the series, we still find these characteristics. If what has been published in Europe as carboniferous, belongs really to that system, we can come to no other con clusion than that above indicated ; for, in our undisturbed and continuous series, the order of succession is most clearly understood. In view of the facts which we have cited, we are unwilling to regard the question of par allelism as decided, and we insist upon the zoological evidence from those forms and those types best entitled to give the character. The distinction of systems by zoological characters is not to be made in one case upon primary, and in another upon subordinate and secondary characters ; and if the whole pal\u00e6ozoic series is to be divided on a certain principle, it must be applied in every instance equally. We cannot avoid the conclusion, that, if we adopt the Devonian system with the limits suggested by foreign writers, we must drop forever the attempt to recognize the Ludlow division of the Silurian system. We can hope for no species equivalent to the peculiar forms in the Schoharie grit and Onondaga limestone, and the numerous bivalves in the Hamilton group ; and, in giving up this and attempting a reconciliation of our groups with the Devonian, we find that we are encroaching upon the preexisting claims of the carboniferous system ; and that we have no zoological types of sufficient importance to enable us to separate one from the other. Although it is not difficult to find the evidences of a general parallelism in our successive groups with those of Europe, yet, when we come to more minute and critical comparisons, the difficulties increase rather than dimin ish. This is more especially true of those subsequent in age to the Wen lock group of Europe, which has its latest phase represented in our lower Helderberg limestones. If, for example, we attempt to find the exact equivalents of the several groups of shale, from the Oriskany sandstone upwards, by the general groups of species, and even by individual species themselves, as far as they have been identified with European forms, we meet with insurmountable difficulties. The relations of our divisions often appear to be in two directions, wdien we take for our standard the Euro pean classification ; and it is impossible to account satisfactorily for the ap parent divergence in the direction of groups as shown by the evidence af forded by the recognized species of European authors. In the first instance, Spirifer Urii and S. arenosus are rather carbonif erous than Devonian species in Europe, and should be regarded as a con necting link between these systems ; while, in this country, they occur in the Oriskany sandstone, immediately succeeding the lower Helderberg limestones, which are positively identified with the Wenlock series of England. The Cephalopoda of the Schoharie grit and Onondaga limestone find their analogues in the Ludlow division. The Cephalopoda of the Marcellus shale, Goniatites, Discites, and others with which are associated one or two species of Productus, ally that group with the carboniferous system ; and, if we can rely upon the position of the Goniatites of Indiana, we have positive carboniferous species in the black slate of the West. The"], [663, "315 [4] Hamilton group, in its numerous Lamellibranchiata, and some species of Orthocerata connects itself in a very positive manner with the Ludlow se ries ; while, by its Brachiopoda, it is related to the Devonian and carboni ferous systems. The Chemung group through its Brachiopoda is, on the one side, related to the carboniferous system ; while, on the other, certain forms indicate a connection with the Devonian. The Lamellibranchiata of the same group are, in part, referable to Ludlowr forms ; while others are recognized as Devonian species. The few species of Cephalopoda known in this group ally it also with the carboniferous period. The Onondaga and corniferous limestones are related to the Devonian system through some species of Brachiopoda and Gasteropoda, which pass upwards into the Hamilton group. If we attempt to express these ideas in a tabular form, so that the whole subject may be brought before the eye at once, we appreciate the difficulties in the way of arriving at satisfactory conclusions, so long as the systems of European pal\u00e6ozoic strata remain under the present arrangement, with the lists of species at present referred to each ; nor will the difficulties be di minished until the absolute sequence of groups, from the Wenlock upwards. is determined in England and on the continent of Europe,"], [664, "[4'1 316 This diagram explains the views which we entertain, and which ap pear unavoidable, regarding the rela tions of our groups with those of Europe, where generic resemblances and the identity of species are made the foundation of our opinions. We have constantly before our eyes a more complete series of pal\u00e6ozoic strata, than has as yet been recog nized in any other part of the world. We know that the order in which our groups are arranged is the order in time. Where the succession is made out from the examination of isolated deposits, the order may not always be the true one ; or, at least, it will be impossible to make the proper al lowance for range of species, or to distinguish so clearly the changes which may have resulted from litto ral and deep-sea deposits. Our nu merous subdivisions, though they may be united in fewer groups, are, nevertheless, important; for every one of them is marked by a distinct inter val of time, and the changes in the character of the deposit indicate changes in the operating influences not to be disregarded. Where the records between two distinct points of time are the most numerous, and the intervals of least duration, there, certainly is to be found the most per fect record of the history of the pe riod. In geological history, we _'ist regard the series which presents to us groups of one age, of less conse quence than another which presents such an apparently single group, sub divided into several ; each one being the evidence of successive changes which are recorded in beds of different materials and characterized by hiero glyphics not to be misinterpreted. So long as we adopt zoological char acters in the designation of groups, and acknowledge these as the most reliable evidence of the age of strata, so long must we recognize those physical subdivisions which contain peculiar groups of species, or types of certain genera ; and such a group must be recognized as a zoological period.

Those who have examined and compared the recorded observations of the rise and fall of the surfaces of the great lakes find themselves greatly perplexed in arriving at exact results. The earliest information, upon which any reliance can be placed, is given by the pioneer settlers who began to oceupy the southern shore of Lake Erie as early as 1795-6. They, however, only give general impressions and recollections. In 1814\u201415 their attention was forcibly drawn to the subject by a very high stage of water, which interfered with their buildings adjacent to the mouths of rivers, which then served as harbors for the few schooners by which the western commerce was transacted. About the close of the war of 1812, the late Brigadier-General Henry Whiting commenced a series of personal observations upon the fluctuations of the Detroit river, at Detnot, and these observations were resumed in 1828 by E. A. Hathan, a civil engineer connected with the water-works of that city. In 1830, Dr. Douglas Houghton began his observations upon the rise and fall of the upper lakes, abstracts of which are given in the Michigan geological reports for the years 1839 and 1841. Since the opening of the New York and Erie canal in 1824, many observations have been made by the state engineers and referred to the mitre-sill of the guard-lock at Black Rock, as a zero. These have been published, from time to time, in the news- papers of Buffalo, particularly in the Commercial Advertiser, but we are not aware that they have ever been collected in a connected and systematic form. In 1844, when Colonel T. B. W. Stockton took charge of the govern- ment works at the harbor of Cleveland, Ohio, he caused a meteorological table to be kept, which is very complete and reliable. From August 1845, to August 1846, inclusive, Colonel Stockton added a water-table. The observations were taken at 6 A.M., at noon, and 6 P.M., by Mr. George Tiebout, which, by the kindness of Mr. D. P. Rhodes, late disbursing agent, I have in my possession. While connected with the geological survey of the state of Ohio, I col lected some information relating to this subject, which was published in the report for the year 1838-9,"], [668, "[4] 320 From August to December 1838, Mr. George C. Davis, of Cleveland, kept a daily register, and since that time I have made occasional measure ments at the same place. In the month of November, 1850, Mr. John Lathrop, a resident engineer of the New York State canal, commenced at Buffalo a register of the stage of the water at that place, twice each day, referred to the bottom of the canal as zero, a portion of which is given below. These are the sources of information within my reach, and I deem the subject of sufficient importance to find a place in this report, not simply as a matter of general interest, but of practical utility ; since all public con structions upon the lakes should be built in reference to the extreme fluctua tions of the water-levels. There are sites of towns laid out during a low stage of water, which in after years have been flooded to the depth of several feet; and others surveyed in a high stage, counting upon a sufficient depth of water for harbors, docks and shipping, which were left by. the reflux at an inconvenient distance from navigable water. An erroneous opinion prevails in the lake region, founded on Indian and French traditions, that the rise and fall of the water is periodical, occurring once in seven years, but an examination of the records of the past twenty-five years will afford no grounds for this belief. It has been the popular impression that there was something mysterious in these secular fluctuations, and that they were in no way connected with the vicissitudes of the seasons; \u2014 a belief which may be easily accounted for, when we take into account the immense size of the basins of the great lakes, and the length of time neces sary for the accumulation of water in such capacious reservoirs to become sensible to the eye. A comparison of the rise and fall of the water of the lake with the recorded observations of the rain-gauge, will show con clusively that the surfaces of these great bodies of water rise gradually after an unusually large amount of rain has been falling during one or more seasons, and that, on the other hand, they fall after a long period during which the quantity of rain has been less than the average ; obeying in this respect, the same laws which influence other collections of water. It will be more satisfactory to the philosophical inquirer and more relia ble for the use of future observers, to give the statements of different authors fiom which I have drawn some conclusions, in their own terms. It will be seen that it is no easy task to reduce the recorded observations to one standard, since some are made from memory alone, \u2014 such being the best and only authority prior to 1814 \u2014 while others were taken on rivers a little distance from their outlets, where the stage of water was influenced by floods. Even those observations taken at the surface of the lake are sub ject to variations, resulting not only from visible causes, such as winds and storms ; but from distant and invisible ones, such as swells and sudden risings.* Thus, at Cleveland, the surface has been known, in perfectly calm weather, to rise and fall suddenly siom three to eighteen inches; but usually within a few hours the cause became apparent in the approach of a gale or storm. One of the uses of the magnetic telegraph is to inform the mariner in port of the prevalence of storms elsewhere, before they burst upon him. The different lakes do not rise or fall at the same time, but in succession ; as the several mill-ponds on a stream are known to fill, during floods, in \u2022 See Chapter II. Part I. of Foster and 'Whitney's report."], [669, "321 [ 4 ] order \u2014 beginning with those nearest the source, and to discharge themselves in the same order. The successive basins of the lakes are so many ponds or enlargements of the St. Lawrence. There is, besides, an annual rise and fall which is not equal in different years, and not precisely uniform over the whole area, during the same season. Taking the best observations at dif ferent points of the same lake, as for example, at Buffalo, Cleveland, and Detroit, for the same year and month and comparing them with each other, discrepancies are apparent in the amount of rise or fall for the same period as deduced from measurements at different places. Another source of diffi culty arises from the different zeros referred to by the different observers. For the zero at Cleveland, in 1838, I made use of one of the courses of masonry on the east pier of the harbor at its southern extremity, being then, the bottom of the first course from the top ; but since the coping has been laid, it is, at this time, the second. This line was used because it cor responded with the highest permanent stage of water within the memory of white men ; and being intended to last so long as commerce shall be pursued on the lake, it was considered sufficiently permanent ; but since that period, portions of the work have subsided a foot or more, and it has been found difficult to restore the zero-level by other marks. The zero of June 25, 1838, was six feet below the surface of the southern end of the parapet- wall as it now stands \u2014 October, 1851. Dr. Houghton and General Whiting took the lowest known stage for their zero, which, according to their best information, occurred June, 1819 ; but other authorities \u2014 and they are numerous \u2014 fix the lowest known stage late in the summer of that year, and also in August, 1820. The difference between 1819 and 1838, at Detroit, is five feet three inches. It is a general tradition that in 1809 and 1810 Lake Erie was even lower than in 1819 and 1820. There is no evidence that, since the settlement of the region by the whites, Lake Erie has been higher than in 1838 ; but at Buffalo and at Detroit, the highest stage is said to have occurred in August, while at Cleveland it occurred on the 25th of June. During that month and the succeeding July, there were several swells which lasted for a few hours or perhaps a day, when the waters rose in the extreme, eighteen inches, flooding warehouses and offices ; but these oscillations were too rapid to be classed among the regular fluctuations of the lake. The Detroit river, with a strong current and \u2022 crooked channel, \u2022 is not as good an index of the flux and reflux of the water as the open lake itself, provided the observations are freed from the sudden influence of winds. With these cautions and explanations, I proceed to give full quotations from the authorities above cited. In the year 1796, the water was low in Lake Erie, as all the early set tlers in the Western Reserve agree. They state that they were able to travel with teams on the beach of the lake, most of the way from Buffalo to Cleveland \u2014 there being no road on the shore \u2014 and that it has never been so broad and continuous since. In 1798, a rise was observed in the lake. Dr. Houghton* says that our oldest inhabitants agree in stating that the waters were high from 1800 to 1802, in proof of which it is alleged that the roads which had before been in use on the banks of the Detroit river were so completely * Michigan Geological Reports, 1839, p. 22. Ex.\u2014 11"], [670, "[ 4 ] 322 inundated as to be impassable.* As a comment on this, it should be observ ed that Detroit has been occupied by the French since 1702, and if, in the intervening century, there had been higher water, the recollection of the event would have been preserved by tradition, and their roads would have been laid at a greater distance above the river. For 1806, the inhabitants along the shore of Lake Erie, in north-eastern Ohio, report the lake as low, and for 1810-11, as very low ; at least six feet below 1848. \" From the years 1809 to 1814, inclusive, the water was generally two feet lower than in 1820. The reefs between this (Buffalo) and Fort Erie were then entirely out of water, but now covered ; and on Bird's Island, which, for many years past, has been almost wholly under water, buildings were erected.\"! Mr. Alonzo Carter of Cleveland, who lived at the mouth of the Cuya hoga river in 1798, says, that the water was then three feet below the flood of 1838, and that the high water of 1815-16 was not equal to that of 1838. Mr. Solomon Juneau, the first settler of Milwaukee in 1838, re marked that the water had never, within his recollection, been so low as it was in 1820 ; and never so high as in June, 1838, when the old Indian race-course was six feet under water. The inhabitants along the southern shore of Lake Erie concur in their recollection of a rise from 1813 to 1816. In 1814, Captain Dobbin, of the revenue service, measured a rise of two feet six inches in three months. Mr. M. Sandford of Erie . says, that he took out stone from a quarry in 1810, which in June, 1838, was six feet under water. In June, 1815, he built a ware-house five feet above water, to which the flood reached in June, 1838, and, during the year 1815, it advanced three feet. \" It is now a matter of record,\" remarks General Whiting, \" that, in 1814-15, the Detroit river was unusually high ; that the foundations of houses, and much land that had long been under cultivation, were submerged. These buildings had been erected many years before, and, of course, under * We here append the testimony of the late Governor Dewitt Clinton, a highly competent observer, contained in the second volume (Part I.) of the Transactions of the New York Literary and Philosophical Society, which appears to have escaped the attention of Mr. Whittlesey. \" Lake Erie began to rise in 1811 and continued to increase until 1815, when it was two feet higher than ever known. The overflowing of the waters destroyed trees on the low lands more than two hundred years old, and the inhabitants of Detroit, which is an ancient settlement, had never seen or heard of such a rise before. It fell a little in 1816, rose again in 1817, and decreased until 1822. In 1810, 1 walked on Bird's Island, situate at the outlet of Lake Erie. In 1816 it was almost covered with water and was scarcely visible. I am informed by an intelligent ship-master of the lakes that ' when he visited Detroit in 1797, the waters were at their height. He went South the following year and did not return to that place until 1802, when he found the waters considerably lower.' [There is great discrepancy between this statement and that contained in the text.] ' Having understood that there was a rise and fall every seven years, he determined to ascertain how great it was j for which purpose he caused marks to be made on a solid wharf, which had been built more than twenty years before, and was perfectly firm and immovable ; and he found that the water declined about an inch a year for nine years. What the fall was for five years during his absence he did not know, but it may be fairly stated at three times as much yearly ; that is, fifteen inches, if compared with subsequent occurrences of a similar character. The lake began to rise again in 1811, in the spring of which it rose six inches, but during the summer it fell two inches. In 1812 it rose fourteen inches and subsided three inches, leaving a nett gain of fifteen inches in two years. The surrender of Detroit to the British, in Octo ber, 1812, compelled him to leave the country ; but in October, 1813, he returned with the fleet, and the water was then at its greatest altitude, having in that year gained twelve inches \u2014 in all twenty-seven inches. In 1814 and 1815, it was stationary. In 1816 and 1817 it fell at least eighteen inches.\"\u2014?. c\\ W. t Buffalo Commercial Advertiser, November 12, 1841."], [671, "323 [4] belief that they were aloof from all but extraordinary elevations. * * * In 1820, or about that time, the rivers had resumed their usual level and several wharves were built, at Detroit, between that year and 1828, at a height, as was supposed, sufficiently above the general level for conve nience and safety. At the latter date, the river had again attained the ele vation of 1815, and remained so until 1830.\" Dr. Houghton* remarks, \" I have been enabled to fix, with a considera ble degree of certainty, upon the height at which the waters of the lake in 1819-20, when they were at their lowest level.\" From a comparison of his own observations on Huron, Michigan, and Superior, with those of Mr. Higgins, General Whiting, and Mr. Hathan, he was enabled to form a table of heights, for the month of June, in each year, taking the lowest stage of water for 1819-20 as the zero.

In this way, some of the conflicting reports as to the stage of the water, that every inquirer meets with, may be reconciled. The annual tide takes place, whether the lake be low or high, and is at its flood in the spring, after the rains of that season and the snows of winter, melted by the warm weather, have united in throwing a surplus of water into all the lakes. In the fall and winter \u2014 when the meteorological conditions are re- versed, and the absence of rain and the presence of frost unite to check the discharge of water from the tributaries \u2014 the lakes, as might be expected, recede twelve, fifteen, and even eighteen inches. Availing myself of the information derived from Messrs. Wal worth, Merchant and others, who were engaged in the construction of the piers at the mouth of the Cuyahoga river, at Cleveland, from 1824 to 1837, 1 have constructed the following table :% Ft. in. 1822, lowest stage, below my zero of June, 1838, at least 5 00 1825, \" \" \" \" \" \" 4 00 1826, general level, - - - - 2 10 1832, \" - - 2 ft. 6 in. to 3 02 1833, - - - - 2 ft. 8 in. to 3 08 * Geol.

Considering the accuracy of these observations, which were freed from the sudden changes which result from winds, I give the weekly mean for those two months : \u2014 the numbers express the average of each week below my zero : ' Ft. in.

A very observing man might have taken the height of the water at Buffalo, in August, and, only a few weeks afterward, during the same season, at Cleveland, and reasonably have concluded, in the absence of strict data, that the surface at the former place had not materially changed in the mean time ; but it is here shown, that a change of one foot in depression occurred in the space of two months. These rapid fluctua tions give rise to doubts in all statements where the precise date is wanting. The same thing renders a reference of one set of observations, in one part of the lake, to another set, made at different seasons, in another part, a very complicated affair : nor is it entirely safe to take the same month, in different years, and compare them together; for neither does the spring rise nor the winter fall always happen at the same period of the year ; nor is the annual flood-tide of one year equal to that of another. Different observers do not agree as to the precise time of either the hi\u00b0h est or lowest general stage of the water. At Cleveland it was unquestion ably the highest about the 25th of June, 1838, when it was two feet five inches below the surface of the main wall at the south end of the east pier ; two feet below the same wall four hundred feet from the south end ; six feet"], [673, "325 [4] four inches below the coping of the lock at the Cuyahoga river, at Merwin street (on the west wing-wall); three feet eighty-eight hundredths below the water table of the Commercial House, corner of Main and River streets, Ohio City ; and was also on a level with the heads of the piles on the river, at the Morocco factory. These marks and benches were established by Mr. Howe, the resident engineer of this division of the Ohio canal ; by General Ahaz Merchant ; by Col. T. B. W. Stockton ; and by myself, independently of each other, and will probably, some of them, remain for future reference, through all time. I am unable to find hi these tables any confirmation of the popular belief, that there is a \"seven years' rise and fall\" of the water in the lakes. The Detroit registers show a continual rise, from 1819 to 1838, or nine- teen years. From 1838 to 1841, a continual decline of three years. In 1842 a slight rise. From 1842 to 1851, eight years, a regular decline. At the other extremity of Lake Erie, accounts differ as to the fact of the lowest water being in 1819 or 1820 ; but the difference between those years was slight. At Black Rock, the highest stage of water is stated to have been in August, and not in June, 1838 ; but at Buffalo it is given in the month of June. Some observers place the lowest water in August, and some in the fall of 1819 ; others in that of 1820 ; and at Buffalo there is a tradition that in 1810 it was still lower. From 1838 to 1841 there was a decline of three years, the same as at Detroit. From 1841 to 1851, ten years, it has been fluctuating up and down, about as much rise as fall ; that is, the total rise 2.75, total fall 2.56. At Cleveland, from 1796 to 1810-11, the water was low, fourteen years ; from 1811 to 1816, five years, rising very rapidly ; from 1816 to 1819, three years, falling rapidly to the lowest known point ; and from 1819 to 1838, nineteen years, a steady rise. Since 1838 there has been a steady decline to March 1846, the low- est since 1819, and since 1846 considerable fluctuation and irregularity. Among all these periods, there is none of seven, and just one of fourteen years. These tables demonstrate the effect of the change of seasons within the year upon the stage of water. They show an annual rise and fall entirely independent of the general height of water fluctuating a certain distance within each year, whether the general surface is high or low.

For five years high water occurred there ; in July once, June once, May once, August once, and October once. For the winter months, when the water is l#sv, the measurements are wanting. At Detroit there are several years when there was little variation during two or three months. In four years (not consecutive, but those best as certained) it was high in June and July three times, and August once, and January, February, and March once. At Cleveland, in five years well ascertained, high water has been, in June four times ; and June, July, and August once ; low, in January once, De cember twice, March once, and August once. So that out of fourteen cases, where the highest months have been regis tered, it has been high in June and July ten times, and in ten cases has been low in December and January six times. It is like other ponds and rivers, raised by the spring freshets, and lowered by frost and drought of winter. At this time Lake Superior is unusually high. During the summer of 1851 it was about three feet above the general level of 1847, when it was unusually low. Lake Huron is stated to have been two and one-half feet higher at the Detour light than in 1847. Lake Michigan is reported to have been higher the past autumn than for several years. The upper lakes being full must discharge a large surplus into lakes Erie and Ontario, which will be felt in the coming spring. If we have a cold and wet season, it will operate at that time to assist the flood of water from the north in raising Lake Erie. If it is warm and dry, it will counteract the effect of a large supply through the Detroit river. Instead of regarding the rise and fall of water in the lakes as a mystery, it is rather to be wondered that there is so little fluctu ation. Their stability is dependent entirely upon the regularity of the sea sons, within the lake country, and if there should be a combination of wet and cold years, wherein the fall of rain should be great, and the evapora tion small, there might be a rise or fall exceeding any thing we have on record."], [676, "[ 4 ] 328 Table showing the highest and lowest stage of water in Lake Erie, for each month, from August 1845 to August 1846, inclusive, drawn at Cleveland, from Colonel T.

Of twenty-one cases of extreme high water above given, eight are due to north-east winds, three to south winds, and three to north-west winds. Of sixteen instances of low water, two are connected with north-east winds, two with westerly, and five with south-west winds. High water occurred oftener in the morning than at noon or evening, and the same of low water, which is in consequence of the changes that occur in the land and sea breezes near the commencement and close of the day. The water has been high in the morning (6 A. M.) ten times, in the even ing five, at noon twice. It has been flUv in the morning seven times, at noon six, in the evening twice. The greatest fluctuations take place in the morning ; of which the most extreme case on these records occurred on the morning of November 19, 1845, after two days' light breeze south, changing to high south-west winds. The water then fell twenty inches below the bottom of the stone wall, or six feet two inches. It is apparent, from the column of differences in the above table, how little reliance can be placed on a single measurement, and how neces sary it is to have a daily register, in order to arrive at the mean surface of the lake. Winds, not felt at this point, may affect the stage of water ma terially.

If this could be done, it would have very much re duced the length of this chapter ; but there are so many discrepancies be tween the different registers which I cannot at present reconcile, that I have thought it best not to attempt to fix a general zero or plane of reference. A general and well arranged system of synchronous observations, kept up for some years at different points on the lakes, is needed before a complete comparison can be made. If we follow the register at Black Rock, the water was four inches higher in August, 1838, than in June ; while at Cleveland, on the other hand, it was nine inches lower. At Black Rock, in August, 1341, it was within nine inches of the lowest known level, that of 1819; but, at the same time, it was not so low at Detroit as in August, 1819, by one foot ten inches. The average fall of the water at Detroit for the year 1841, was one foot; at Black Rock the average fall from May to October of the same year, was 1.63 feet ; which is even less than it would have been for the entire year. The average of the summer months of 1840, at Detroit, was two feet ten inches above the level of 1819, and at Black Rock, two feet two inches ; thus showing a difference of eight inches in the amount of rise at the two places during the same period. By using the observations which were made at Cleveland and Detroit during the months of September, October, November and December, we might determine the difference between the zeros of those two places, pro vided that the rise and fall of the river and lake w ere equal. Thus the observations for four months at Detroit, according to Mr. Ha than, give for the level of the water at that place, four feet six inches below zero ; the observations at Cleveland for the same period, give an average of one foot one inch below the zero of that place ; making the zero of Cleve land three feet five inches below that of Detroit. According to the observations made by Mr. Lathrop and myself during the months of June and July, 1851, at a time when the lake was little dis turbed by winds, the average level of the water was, at Buffalo, 9.41 feet above the zero of that place, and at Cleveland 2 feet below the zero of that city; making the zero of Cleveland 11.41 feet higher than that of Buffalo. But if we reduce the observations at Black Rock to the standard, we find that the low water of October, 1841, was below the level of 1819, when it is universally agreed that this was the lowest known stage. Mr. Lathrop remarks, that the depth of water on the mitre-sill of the guard-lock at Black Rock is very much influenced by the mills which are fed from that basin. The records show that, from some cause, the fluctuations are greater at Black Rock than at either Cleveland or Detroit, so that, whatever may be) the cause of the error or difference, the registers at the eastern extremity o the lake are not a safe index of the level of the water elsewhere. The fail at Black Rock from August, 1838, to October, 1841, was five feet nine inches ; while at Detroit, it was only three feet four inches during the same period. Cleveland is better situated than Buffalo for the purpose of regis tering accurately the fluctuations of the lake ; for, while the former city is nearly midway between its two extremities, and opposite its widest part ; the latter city, on the other hand, is placed at the vertex of a triangle formed by the sides of the lake, and at its eastern extremity, so that the waters are"], [684, "s 4 ] 3&> crowded by a south-west wind into a constantly narrowing space, and of course rise higher than they would otherwise do. Thus, during a gale, which blew down the lake on the night of the 18th of October, 1849, the water rose fifteen feet six inches above the point to which it fell during an easterly gale, on the 18th of April, 1848. The greatest sudden change noticed at Cleveland, was November 19th, 1845, when the water fell 2.5 feet. At Chicago the level of the lake is said to have oscillated through a space of four feet during twenty-four hours, in June, 1851. The greatest range of one month at Cleveland, was in August, 1845, when the difference between the highest and lowest stage of water was, according to Colonel Stockton's tables, two feet eleven inches. The greatest range of the fluctuations, in 1845 and 1846, was three feet three inches. The regis- ters of Colonel Stockton and Mr. Lathrop show that the greatest oscillations of the lakes are due to south-westerly and easterly winds ; but these winds depress the water at Cleveland, while they raise it at Detroit. If our materials were sufficiently ample to enable us to form a general table, expressing the mean monthly stage of the water for an uninterrupted series of years, the annual rise and fall could easily be exhibited by curves constructed upon the measurements as ordinates. The relations between the observations at Detroit, Cleveland and Buffalo, are, however, as yet too im perfectly understood, and the registers are incapable of being reduced to one plane of reference. They are here, therefore, collated and arranged for future use; but before leaving the subject, I will draw up a tabular state ment, showing the time of the year when high or low water has been ob served, and the amount of the annual rise or fall for the few years covered by the registers. Table showing the annual Rise and Fall of Lake Erie- Now it doe s not follow that if observations had been taken at all these E laces since 1 837, the time of high and low water of each year would have een the sam e at each place, or even that it would have fallen in the same month.

A south-west wind sweeping over Lakes Michigan, Huron and Erie operates quite differ ently upon their surfaces. While it accelerates the discharge of the water from Lake Erie, and lowers the surface of that lake at its western end, it checks at the same time the flow from Lake Huron ; thus operating in a two-fold manner to depress its surface. A north-east gale, on the other hand, forces back the water of Lake Erie and increases the discharge of Lake Huron, so that there is a corresponding rise of the water at the west ern extremity of the former lake. Neither do all the lakes reach their maximum height at the same time, but successively, according to the com bined action of the various meteorological causes. In general, the great lakes rise and fall nearly together ; but not abso lutely at the same time, nor by an equal amount. It is apparent from these statistics that there is no foundation for the popular belief that there is a rise and fall of the lakes during a period of fourteen years. Between 1796-8 and 1819-20, a period of twenty years, there was a gradual depression and rising of the lakes. From 1816 to 1819-20, the waters fell to a lower level than even their previous stage of depression. From 1819-20 to 1838, a period of eighteen years, there was a steady increase of elevation, when the water attained its greatest known height. The lowest stage of water, since that time, occurred in October 18 tl, which was less than three and a half years after the preceding great depression. No person, who examines the daily registers, will find any grounds for the belief that there is in Lake Erie a daily or lunar tide, like that of the ocean. As before remarked, the causes which produce changes in the levels of the lakes are the same as those which influence other collections of water ; that is, the ever-varying amount of rain and evaporation. The records of the rain-gauge throughout the north-west are yet too meagre to enable us to determine the amount of falling water over the basins of these lakes ; but I will avail myself of such materials as are in my possession. From the rain-gauge kept at the Pennsylvania Hospital, we derive the following results :* From 1810 (low water) to 1815, (high water) 5 years - 185.68 inches.

Those of Philadelphia and Marietta being out of the valley of the St. Lawrence, are not a certain guide in determining the amount of rain which fell within those periods, in the region of the lakes. The observations at Hudson, and at the various military posts, do not extend back sufficiently far to enable us to draw certain conclusions. For periods of five yeais, there must be a similarity between the seasons of the lake-country and of Philadelphia. From the low water of 1810 to the high water of 1814-15, there fell, in Pennsylvania, 34.54 inches of rain more than for the years from 1815 to 1819. If this be true of the lake region, the only wonder is that the rise of water was not greater. The area drained by the lakes is estimated as being four times as great as their surface, and the amount of water poured into them by their various afflu ents, unless checked by evaporation, would raise their surface twelve feet. The mean of the eleven years prior to the flood of 1838 is very large, being forty-one inches, or eleven inches per annum greater than that of the preceding low water of 1819. So for ten years out of twenty, of the time of the gradual rise from 1819 to 1838, Dr. Hildreth's gauge, in the valley of the Ohio, one hundred and eighty miles south of Lake Erie, gives an ave rage of 43.2 inches \u2014 a very large increase. The great rise of 1838 is due to causes which operated in 1837 and years preceding, so that the reports of the army surgeons are divided in point of time ; the years 1838 and 18390 belonging to a declining stage, while those of 1836 and 1837 belong to : in advancing stage. The records of Professor Loomis , and his successors at Hudson, begin in 1838, with the flood of that year, ; ind continue with some intermissions to the present time. The lowest sta^ ;e since 1838, happened in 1841. The 'Meteorologi cal Register, p. 99."], [687, "339 [4] mean of these four years is, for Hudson, 31.27 inches, which is a foot per year lower than that for ten years prior to 1838, at Marietta. The mean of three years since 1841, is 32.86 inches, and from 1848 to the present time 39.36 inches, showing a large increase, amounting to nearly seven inches per annum. For this period the measurements of the lake-surface are too imperfect to enable us to estimate the actual rise. On Lake Superior the years 1845-6 were unusually dry, and in 1847 that lake had reached a very low stage of water. The years 1849-50 were in that region wet, and the lake as a necessary consequence is now (1851) very high ; that is, from three to three and one-halt feet above the level of 1847."], [688, "[4] 340 CHAPTER XX.

Having had occasion to pass for many hundred miles along the surveyed lines ot the public lands in Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota, and to observe the practical workings of the present system of surveys, I deem it not out of place to devote a chapter to their examination. The records of surveys in these States have frequently been submitted to my in spection by the surveyors-general in charge, and I have frequently met with the deputy surveyors engaged in their toilsome labors, in the depths of the forest, remote from civilization, carrying their instruments, camp equipage, and provisions on their backs, through places where neither horse nor canoe could penetrate, and have thus had occasion to admire their perseverance and fortitude. In these expeditions, they are frequently buried for a whole season in the forest \u2014 far from human settlements, sometimes short of pro visions, and always destitute of what are called luxuries ; their clothing, especially towards the close of the season, in shreds, and, to an observer from a civilized region, they present an aspect by no means attractive. I have seen them under circumstances which required great promptness and energy, and have generally observed that they possessed inflexible integrity in fulfilling their contracts, where there were many discouragements and many temptations to slight their work. There are, however, a few cases where fictitious field-notes have been returned ; but, when we consider the number of persons engaged in this service, and the slight supervision to which they are subjected, as well as the inadequacy of their compensation, particularly in regions where timber abounds, they may be regarded as among the most scrupulous and merito rious of public officers. Many of them possess mathematical attainments of a high order, great general intelligence, and a degree of fortitude and perseverance which should command respect. Having traversed the field of their labors and inspected their notes, I propose to institute a comparison between their results and those obtained by astronomical observations."], [689, "341 [ 4 ] I shall first, however, present, with little or no comment, a series of mag* netic observations taken along certain meridians and base lines, or parallels of latitude, which intersect each other in squares of about sixty miles. They will be useful as illustrating the intensity of magnetic forces, and of practical utility to those who may be commissioned to make the subdivisions into sections. The annual change in variation can thus be fixed ; and they will serve as a standard of reference hereafter. Those taken by Burt's Solar compass,* which includes most of those given since the year 1839, may be regarded as reliable. The surveys of the public lands, west of the Alleghany Mountains, ex tend over an area greater than that of any other surveyed portion of the globe, and if all the data repecting the variations of the needle were col lected, they would afford a mass of facts worthy of reliance and unequalled by any collection thus far made. The parallels, or lines of equal variation, in the United States, could then be laid down for the present period with great accuracy. Those who study the reported variations for the State of Michigan would do well to bear in mind that the Upper peninsula, west of Chocolate river, is a region of great local disturbance ; and that the surveys on the Lower peninsula, below the second correction line, were not made with the Solar compass, and that, therefore, the results must be taken with some grains of allowance. The rectangular system of surveys, adopted for the first time by the Uni ted States in 1785, on the recommendation of Thomas Hutchings, is so sim ple that the position of any surveyed township or section is known, at once, by reading the letters and figures, cut upon the witness and bearing trees. Each township of six miles square has a number different from every other ; and to follow the variations given below, from point to point, it is only necessary to take the meridian as a starting line, when reckoning east or west ; and the base when reckoning north or south. Numbering the town ships north or south from the base line, they are called Towns ; number ing east or west from the meridian, they are called Ranges. Thus, T. 20 N., R. 10, E., indicates a township one hundred and twenty miles north of the base line and sixty miles east of the meridian. The latitudes and longitudes are not intended, as here given, to be authority, unless the name of the observer is indicated ; they are necessary, however, to a full understanding of the position of the compass, when the variations were noted ; but are generally derived from maps, or astrono mical observations. So, too, the length of most of the lines given has been derived from maps, unless the length be given in miles and chains, or used for the express purpose of deducing longitudes by measure ment, in order to compare with the reported astronomical results. These distances should, therefore, be regarded only as near approximations, and not as strictly accurate. * This ingenious instrument, invented by William A. Burt, of Mount Vernon, Michigan, about the year 1836, does not appear to have attracted the attention which it merits. It is well known that the magnetic needle is everywhere subject to many fluctuations, regular and irregular, and that it will not mark a straight line. In the rough regions of the north, where the igneous rocks themselves often contain magnetic oxide of iron, and where there are immense deposits of iron ore, often magnetic, a common compass is frequently entirely use less. Transcripts, which are given below, show variations of 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, and even 175\u00b0, in the distance of half a mile. Without the Solar compass the region could not have been surveyed, except at a cost exceeding the value of the land."], [690, "[4] 342 To provide for the convergence of the meridional or range lines, the first row of townships north, on a base or correction line, is made more than six miles broad, east and west ; this excess, generally amounting to about three chains, is not the same in all latitudes, and even in the same latitude is not made equal by all surveyors. The last row to the north, or next south of the correction line (sixty miles northward) will be less than six miles, by about the same quantity, only a few of the townships that are midway being exactly six miles in breadth. With these prefatory remarks, we proceed to give the variations furnished by the Surveyor General at Detroit, for the State of Michigan. VARIATIONS IN MICHIGAN.

REMARKS ON THE VARIATIONS IN MICHIGAN. By reference to the variations on the east and west lines between T. 41 and 42 N., near Mackinac, it will be seen that the line of no variation, or zero, touches the State of Michigan in R. 7 E., on Drummond's island. Mr. Higgins, in the geological report of Michigan, for 1841, has laid down, from the precise observations of William A. Burt, the line of no variation from Lake Huron to Lake Superior, and given much additional original in formation, to which reference is here made. The line is very tortuous, but keeps near the St. Mary's river, crossing different belts of rock, igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary. In 1820-24, Captain Bayfield, of the British Admiralty survey, took the variation on Lake Superior, at various places, some of which were as follows : Michipicoten island, lat. 47\u00b0 40' N., long. 85\u00b0 20' W., 6\u00b0 00' E. Granite island, 46\u00b0 40' 87\u00b0 30' 8\u00b0 00' .\u00ab* Keweenaw Point, 47\u00b0 30' 88\u00b0 30' 9\u00b0 00' Apostle islands, 47\u00b0 00' 91\u00b0 00' 12\u00b0 00' Pic island, 48\u00b0 40' 86\u00b0 40' 8\u00b0 00' Mr. Frederick Hubbard, assistant on the Michigan survey, made some observations upon this subject in 1840. In July of that year, he found the variation to be, at La Pointe, 8\u00b0 33' E., or 3\u00b0 27' less than Bayfield \u2014 in dicating a change to that amount in the course of a little more than a quar ter of a century. The variations for Keweenaw Point, in the tables above given for 1844, range from 4\u00b0 20' to 8\u00b0 07' E. \u2014 being much affected by local attraction in consequence of the trap rocks containing a large per centage of magnetic oxide of iron. The same remark will apply to Isle Royale, where, in 1847, the variation was from 4\u00b0 to 14\u00b0 E. Between July 13 and August 1, 1839, Mr. W. A. Burt made very care ful observations on the diurnal variation of the needle, at Mount Vernon, Michigan. The results were as follows : Average 01 twenty days, at 5 h. 30 min. A. M., 1\u00b0 39' 53\" 1 h. 00 min. P. M., 1\u00b0 28' 45\" \u00ab \" \u00ab 6 h. 30 min. P. M., 1\u00b0 33' 06\" . The difference of these numbers gives the diurnal variation as follows : Between morning and evening 5'.93 Between morning and noon 11'.08 Between noon and evening ---- 5M5 COMPARISON OF ASTRONOMICAL AND TERRESTRIAL MEASUREMENTS. Having thus adverted to the principal phenomena of variation in this re gion, so far as the materials in our possession will enable us to do, we now propose to compare the terrestrial measurements of the linear surveyors in"], [700, "[ 4 ] 352 the north-west, with the results of astronomical observations. And here a brief discussion of the two modes for the determination of longitude may not be inappropriate. Although the measurements of the surveyors, pass ing, as their lines do, over swamps, rivers, precipices, and thickets, are lia ble to many minute errors, yet these errors, in the main, counteract one an other. As the work is done by many persons, using different instruments, it is hardly possible that small errors should accumulate ; and if they did, the subsequent work, always closing upon that which was done before, would detect mistakes, or bad measurements, and become apparent in the returns to the office. The correction, base, and meridian lines, since the introduction of the Solar compass, have been generally surveyed with much care, particularly the principal meridians ; so that they may be re garded as following very nearly parallels of longitude. The distances measured by the chain, along the base, correction, and meridian lines, may also be regarded as nearly accurate, as much so as could be expected from a single measurement, where so many obstacles are necessarily encountered. The interior township and range lines are not required to be made with so much care, because the principal exterior lines serve to stop the errors, if any accrue. This is why, as will appear from an examination of the con vergence of range lines, in the tables given below, the width of the upper tier of townships is less than six miles ; but this irregularity may be amend ed on the next correction line, by making full townships. Thus, the con vergence of range lines, for sixty miles below latitude 46\u00b0 N., being seven chains, sixty links, if the lower tier of townships on the correction line, sixty miles south, were made six miles, three chains, and eighty links, the townships midway would be exactly six miles wide, and those on latitude 46\u00b0 would fall short, three chains and eighty links. -It will make the sub ject more intelligible to refer to the manner in which the public surveys have been conducted. A principal meridian and a base line are first run through large tracts, generally embracing a State or States. These meri dians are numbered from east to west. The First principal meridian forms the division between Ohio and Indiana, on longitude 84\u00b0 51' west from Greenwich. The Second principal meridian divides the state of Indiana north and south, terminating at its northern boundary. There isa \" Michigan Meridian,\" not numbered, which commences at the north line of the state of Ohio, twenty-two miles east of the first me ridian, and, running through the Lower peninsula, crosses the straits of Mackinac and terminates at Saut Ste Marie. The Third principal meridian begins at the mouth of the Ohio river, run ning north to the northern boundary of Illinois, where it terminates. The Fourth principal meridian commences at the mouth of the Illinois river, at Alton, latitude 38\u00b0 58' 12\" N., longitude 90\u00b0 29' 56\".7 W., and extends through the States of Illinois and Wisconsin, terminating on Lake Superior, at a point fourteen chains, seventy-seven links, S. 65\u00b0 W. along the shore, from the mouth of the Montreal river \u2014 its length being three hundred and forty miles. The Fifth principal meridian starts from the mouth of the Arkansas river, on the Mississippi, and has been extended north through Arkansas, Mis souri, and Iowa, to near latitude 43\u00b0 30', being about twenty-five miles to the west of the fourth meridian. When we consider that it repeatedly crosses the bends of the Mississippi and passes through the broad, swampy"], [701, "353 [ 4 ] marshes of Arkansas ; and, further, as it was surveyed with the needle and not with the Solar compass, it cannot be regarded as very correct. From the mouth of the Illinois, where it overlaps the fourth meridian, to Dubuque, in latitude 42\u00b0 30', these two meridians maintain about the same distance from one another ; whereas, if they pursued their respective longi tudes, they should converge, in that distance, about three miles. At right angles to all these meridians are east and west correction and base lines, once in sixty miles, or about 52' of latitude. Such are the lines made use of in the following computations. I know of no portion of the earth's surface on which there are so many and so regularly measured lines as in the Mississippi valley. This opportunity of making a mutual refer ence to the terrestrial and celestial methods of fixing points upon our planet is unequalled, and the results of theory and science may thus be placed in contiguity with those of actual measurements. If the discrepancies should be great and general, we must infer that there is, in one or the other, some imperfection which should be remedied ; but, if it appear to be the case, that the results harmonize remarkably well, the accuracy of both modes is theoretically and practically established. The tables of convergence in par allels of longitude, through all degrees of latitude, are based upon a nice calculation of the oblate spheroidal form of the earth. The correspond ence of these tables with the measurements which I shall introduce, extend ing over large areas, is a gratifying instance of the truth of philosophy and mathematics, demonstrated by a process familiar to the most ordinary minds. The Superintendent of the Coast Survey is engaged in determining the longitudes of different places in the United States, particularly by means of the e'eclric te'egraph ; and from this source I have been furnished with the results for Cincinnati and St. Louis. The longitude of Cincinnati is 84\u00b0 29' 48\".8. In time, 5h. 8m. 12s.: (Washington) OOh. 23m. 47s. Longitude of St. Louis, 90\u00b0 12' 57\".7. In time, 5h. 8m. 12s.+52m. 40s. = 6h.00m.52s. The determination of the longitude of the Cathedral at St. Louis, by Nicollet, differed from this, 2' 16\".3 of arc, being 90\u00b0 15' 16\". The measured distance, by the public surveys, between Cincinnati and St. Louis, reduced to the parallel of latitude for the former place, and that cor rected for convergence, is 310.32 miles, which is equal to a difference in longitude of 5\u00b0 45' 57\". 6 ; and the distance above given, according to the best authority, deduced from observations made by the aid of the telegraph, is 5\u00b0 43' 15\" \u2014 a discrepancy of 2' 42\".6 of arc. The western boundary of Ohio was doubtless established with care and should follow the true meridian. If it does, we can deduce, from Cincin nati, the longitude of the south end of the meridian of Michigan, which is twenty-two miles east of the first, or Ohio meridian, and two and one half miles east of Cincinnati ; making it, in longitude, 84\u00b0 26' 50\" W. If this meridian has been well carried up, the longitude of the Falls of the St. Mary is the same, for this meridian terminates there, being about three hundred and thirty miles long.* The next corresponding meridian to the west, is the Fourth, or Wisconsin * On comparing the longitude of the point where this meridian meets the Falls of the St. Mary's river, as laid down on Bayfield's Chart (84\u00b0 33' 40\"), with that obtained for its southern extremity, as given above, we find a discrepancy of 6' 50\" of arc, which can hardly be due to tho error of so distinguished an observer as Bayfield.

The distance between these meridians, measured west, on a parallel of latitude from the foot of the Michigan meridian, across In diana and Illinois, is 318.10 miles ; the distance between the upper, or northern extremities of these meridians, on Lake Superior, is very nearly 292.64 miles ; showing a convergence of the ground of 25.46 miles. I give the latitude of the southern end of the Michigan meridian only approximatively at 41\u00b0 54' N., and that of the upper end, at Saut Ste. Ma rie, at 46\u00b0 31'. The latitude of the north end of the Wisconsin meridian, as given by Captain Cram, is 46\u00b0 33'. The theoretical convergence, by thej tables from the south to the north end of these meridians, is 24.75 miles \u2014 differing from the result above given only .71 mile. In the longitude of the mouth of the Montreal, as deduced from the sur veys of William A. Burt, there is a discrepancy, when compared with the reported longitude, which indicates an error somewhere. The surveys have not been carried across from the Fourth meridian to the Mississippi, at the mouth of the Crow-wing river, near Fort Gaines, where a discrepancy is found in the position of that place. The measured distance from the Fourth meridian, along the Fifth correc tion line, to the meridian of Crow-wing, is one hundred and ninety miles and nine chains ; which, corrected for convergence, and converted into de grees and minutes of arc, gives 3\u00b0 58' 30\" as the difference of longitude west. The reputed longitude of the Montreal river is 90\u00b0 44' 30\", and of Crow wing 94\u00b0 22' 45\", making a difference of 3\u00b0 38' 15\", or 20' 13\" of arc less than the surveys, and equal to about 16.2 miles. It becomes necessary to form a conclusion, whether the error is due to terrestrial or celestial meas urements. The longitude of the southern extremity of the Fourth meridian, at Alton, Illinois, is closely determined from St. Louis, and is put at 90\u00b0 29' 56.7\", and the same meridian passes within fourteen chains west of the mouth of the Montreal river. If it is well run, the longitude of its mouth should differ only about 12\" of arc, while the difference is 14' 43\" to the west. From the longitude deduced from the Michigan meridian it differs 11' also to the west.* Though undiscovered errors, in running these lines, may exist, or in measuring the correction lines, the question arises, whether so great a mis take could possibly occur, as is shown here, of 8.5 to 10.5 miles. The work of determining longitude chronometrically, on land, is known to be very difficult and requires much time devoted to observations. This * The longitude of the mouth of the Montreal river, according to Bayfield, is 90\u00b0 35' 15\" and taking that of Crow-wing, as given above on the authority of Nicoilet and Lieutenant Derby, at 94\u00b0 22' 45\", we have a difference of 3\u00b0 47' 30\". Comparing this with the differ ence of longitude, as deduced from the linear surveys by Mr. Whittlesey, we have a discre pancy of 11', which is considerably less than that which results from assuming the longi tude of the Montreal river, given by Captain Cram. In like manner, using Bayfield's longi tude of the Montreal river, and comparing it with that of Alton, as given above, we have a difference of 5' 7.7\" between the results of the astronomical measurement of the longitude of the two places, which should have the same longitude, if the meridian was cor rectly run by the linear surveyors. The discrepancies in each of these cases are very con siderable, but indicate that the position of the Montreal river was more accurately \"deter mined by Bayfield than by Captain Cram. Probably at least a part of the error is due to the nature of the ground over which the northern portion of the meridian in question passes, and the difficulty which the surveyors found themselves obliged to contend with in executing this work. . F. & W."], [703, "355 [4 may not have been practicable at the Montreal and Crow-wing rivers,* and, until the details of the observations are examined, it would \u00b0be impossible to say what weight is to be given them. To throw the errors entirely on the surveyed lines, it is necessary to suppose that it commenced in the First principal meridian, in Ohio, and that the same departure from the true me ridian accrued in the same direction, in Michigan, and in the Fourth meri dian, and that it has not been observed by those who ran the township lines adjacent to them. At the Crow-wing river the discrepancy is to the east ; thus bringing this point and the mouth of the Montreal river too near together, by 20' 30\", of which 11' to 14' is shown as probably due to the observations at the Mon treal river. The first named point is reported to be in longitude 94\u00b0 22' 45\" west, and, as deduced from measurements, is 94\u00b0 32' \u2014 a difference of 9' 15\". CONVERGENCE OP RANGE LINES. We next propose to examine the convergence of range lines, from one correction line to another, as shown by the surveys in Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa.

On the Fourth correction line in Michigan, about latitude 45\u00b0 50' N., the average convergence of range lines for twenty-nine\" townships west of the meridian, is, by field measurements, 6 chains 65.5 links ; in theory, 7 chains 45 links ; but this correction line having been taken across and around Lake Michigan, is hardly a fair example for comparison. The townships on the correction line below, as well as all those in the upper peninsula, are made, on the correction line, two chains under six miles, in order to throw part of the irregularity upon the lower or southern townships. This excess of two chains is not enough for that latitude to equalize the town ships between correction lines, as will appear by results.

For twenty-six ranges next west of the Michigan meridian, and next south of the fifth correction line, the actual average convergence is 7 chains 50 links per range and township.

It thus appears, from a general average in the lower part of Iowa, that, where the ranges are made 6 miles and 3 chains on the correction lines, they do not vary materially from equalizing the convergence; so that the upper townships fall as much short of six miles in breadth as the lower ones exceed it ; but further north, in Iowa and Minnesota, a greater breadth than 6 miles and 3 chains is necessary on the correction lines ; and as the surveys proceed northward, the excess should be greater. The great inequalities in conse quence of this, as shown by the difference from range to range, below the second correction, is probably owing to the use of the magnetic compass."], [707, "359 [4] CHAPTER XXL BOTANY. BY W. D. WHITNEY. Remarks on the Flora of this Region. \u2014 Predominance of Northern Types. \u2014 Effect of the Lakes in equalizing the Temperature. \u2014 The Character of the Vegetation little influenced by the geological Forma- tions. \u2014 List of Plants, with Remarks on some of the more important Trees and Shrubs. The following list comprises all the plants noticed by members of the Corps, between the 1st of July and the 1st of October, 1849, in the ter ritory included within the limits of the survey. The parts of the territory visited, and more or less carefully examined, were Mackinac, the Saut, the southern shore of the lake from the latter place to Carp river, the north-eastern extremity of Keweenaw point, the Ontonagon valley as far up as the metalliferous range, and Isle Royale. It was intended to make the search after species as thorough as circumstances would allow, but they were so often and so variously unfavorable, and the region explored bears so small a proportion to that left unvisited, that the list cannot be other wise than very incomplete. A few observations on the frequency, mode of occurrence, &c, are ap pended to the names of many of the species, especially of the forest trees and shrubs, and these perhaps include all that it is necessary to say on the subject of the like vegetation in general. The following remarks, however, may be added by way of introduction. The whole face of the lake country is covered with a dense forest, un broken, save by the clearings of the settlers and the few natural meadows and open marshes which are scattered here and there along the rivers, espe cially near their mouths. The constitution of this forest is such as is characteristic of so high a northern latitude. The peculiarities consist, not as much in the introduction of new and exclusively northern species \u2014 for there is hardly one of any importance that does not occur also on the high lands of the middle states \u2014 as in the increased frequency and predominance of certain northern types, and the total absence or great rarity of many which are the most familiar to the eye of the dweller farther south. Thus, all the trees that have esculent fruit, the oak, walnut, chestnut, beech, &c, are either quite wanting, or of very unfrequent occurrence ; while the spru ces, the fir, the cedar, the red pine, the birches, the aspen, poplar, &c, are the prevailing growth. With the lesser herbaceous species it is somewhat diffe rent, and a much larger proportion of them are solely northern. The gene ral distribution of the more important species through the country is very uniform. This would, for a variety of reasons, be naturally expected. The region explored extends through no great reach of latitude, and the influence of the great body of water about which it lies, is, of course, like that of the ocean, equalizing. Even Isle Royale hardly exhibits any dif ference in the character of its vegetation from the southern shores of the"], [708, "[4] 360 lake. Nor, in that part of the region visited by us, were there highlands of sufficient elevation and extent to impress a peculiar character upon the growth covering them. The two highest and most extensive mountain ranges \u2014 those of the Porcupine and Huron mountains \u2014 were not ascend ed this year ; upon them it is probable that some modification of the Flora might be noticed. Nor could it be seen that the geological formations, un derlying the soil, exercised any modifying influence upon the forests above them. They are too limited in their extent, and too frequently interchanged to exert any such influence ; and, moreover, comparatively little of the soil upon them is of local origin, resulting from their decomposition ; but the northern drift occupies most of the surface. It is in the distribution of this drift, and the consequent clayey, or gravelly, or sandy nature of the soil, that the law of distribution of the native plants also is, in great meas ure, to be sought. But most of all is it the presence of a greater or less quantity of moisture, that determines with what growth a tract of country shall be clothed, and the most important variations are those dependent upon this cause.

The first four maples are very generally distributed throughout the lake country, and may often be found within the space of a few square rods. Yet in some quarters the sugar maple is altogether wanting, and its place is supplied by an abundant growth of the red. It is thus at Macki- nac, and in the vicinity of Copper Harbor. Of the four, the sugar maple, or \"sugar,\" as it is commonly styled by the settlers, is by far the most useful and important. In the almost total ab- sence of oaks and hickories, it is the sole dependence of the set- tlers for hard wood fuel, and for charcoal. As furnishing the latter article, and of the first quality, it is especially indispensa- ble in the iron region ; and, fortunately, it is nowhere found more abundantly, or of larger and finer growth. Considerable sugar is made from it, both by the Indians and whites ; but the resources of the country in this line are far from being so fully developed as the great distance from the seaboard, and compara- tive infrequency of communication, render expedient. As fur- nishing ornamental woods to the cabinet-maker, also, the Lake Superior majiles, both sugar and red, are of considerable eco- nomical value. It is a remarkable fact, that nearly every maple trunk in these forests affords one or other of those beautiful and highly-prized varieties of structure, known as \" birds-eye \" and \" curled \" maple. A saw-mill has recently been erected on the main shore, opposite Grand Island, for the purpose, mainly, of furnishing these ornamental woods for exportation below; and it would seem that the enterprise can hardly fail to prove a profitable one. The A. spicatum, which generally occurs only as a bush, here attains, in many instances, the dignity of an under sized tree.

Empetrum, Tourn. nigrum, L. (Crowberry.) CUPULIFER\u00c6. Quercus, L. rubra, L. (Black Oak.) The great family of oaks is represented in the vicinity of the lake by this single species only ; and even this is of rather rare occurrence, and attains no great size, appearing generally as a high bush, or a low scraggy tree. It was only in the Ontonagon valley that we found it rising to any- thing like the proper height and majestic appearance of the oak. It is of little or no value as timber. Fagus, Tourn. ferruginea, Ait. (Beech.) The beech forms a considerable share of the growth on the island of Mackinac, but from thence north- ward and westward, we saw no more of it, excepting at one point. This was at the Pictured Rocks, on a tract stretching back from the edge of those precipices, the soil of which was a fine light drift-sand. It was thriving admirably then, much excelling in size and appearance the rather dwarfish growth at Mackinac."], [721, "373 [4] CoRYLtrs, Tourn. rostrata, Ait. (Beaked Hazel.) americana, Walt. (Hazel.) Tie hazels are very common as under- brush, in almost every dry forest. No appearance of fruit was at any time noticed upon them ; and indeed, by the absence of some species, and the rarity or sterility of others, the lake region seems almost entirely deprived of nuts of native growth. With the nuts, of course, are also found wanting the\" squirrels, except the red and ground squirrels. Ostrya, Micheli. virginica, (Willd.) (Hop Hornbeam.) On the trap ridges, the hop hornbeam, or iron-wood, as it is generally called, is not unfre- quently found sparingly scattered through the forest. Its exceeding hardness and toughness render it valuable where strength, and no great size of material, is required. MYRICACE\u00c6. Myrica, L. gale, L. (Sweet Gale.) BETULACE\u00c6. Betula, Tourn. lenta, L. (Black Birch.) excelsa, Ait. (Yellow Birch.) papyracea, Ait. (White Birch.) One or two of the dwarf Alpine species undoubtedly also occur on the ridges, but they were not noticed. The last of the three mentioned \u2014 the canoe, or paper, or white birch \u2014 is the most abundant, occurring almost every- where, interspersed among the other species of the deciduous forests. It is valuable for the almost infinite variety of uses to which its bark can be turned \u2014 from the manufacture of canoes down to the preparation of little specimen boxes and water cups, and the kindling of camp fires. It arrives at considerable size in the lake forests ; but we nowhere meet with trees capable of furnishing bark in sheets large enough for the uses of the canoe builder. For fuel it is much infericr to the black birch, which ranks second only to the sugar maple. The black birch is also plentiful, although more nice in the selection of its soil than the other ; it is rather confined to high or rocky ground. It attains a most majestic size. Its wood is valuable, not only for burning, but also for the various uses of the cabinet maker. Alnus, Tourn. incana, Willd. viridis, D. C. Both these alders are abundant in the lake country, but they occur in quite different situations. The former prefers a wet soil, and forms here and there compact and tangled \"alder swamps\" on flooded land; or, especially and frequently, long strips of almost impenetrable thicket, a few rods in width on either side the river that cuts and pretends to dram an extensive cedar-swamp. The other is generally scattered along the shore, pn dry and rocky lands."], [722, "[4] 374 SALICACE\u00c6. Populus, Tourn. tremuloides, Michx. (Aspen.) grandidentata, Michx. (Great Poplar.) balsamifera, L. Of these three poplars the first is so much the most abundant, that the others are hardly worth mentioning; and indeed the latter are quite rare, and only individual specimens were found by us occurring here and there. The former, on the contrary, is one of the commonest species about the lake. It is the tree that seems to spring up most readily and abundantly, where the ancient forest has been prostrated by fire or tempest, although nowhere excluding all intermixture of other species, as the birches, maples, and lesser evergreens. It is of little or no economical value, and indeed seldom attains a size sufficient to furnish any considerable timber. Yet it excels the southern growth of the same species; and on the northern ridge of Isle Royale there are trees of it which tower conspicuously above the mass of the forest about them. The willows which, as at the East, are found more or less abundantly everywhere in moist grounds, it was not found convenient to analyze and identify. URTICACE\u00c6. Urtica, Tourn. canadensis, L. (Nettle.) Ontonagon river. CONIFER\u00c6. Pinus, Tourn. banksiana, Lamb. resinosa, Ait. (Red or Norway Pine.) strobus, L. (White Pine.) The white pine is to be found in all parts of the lake country ; yet nowhere did we find it growing in great abundance, nowhere forming what could properly be called a fine forest. It rather appears in single trees, standing amid the mass of deciduous forest, and far overtopping it, or in little clumps of a dozen or two, on the crest of a ridge. In many quarters, as for example, in the vicinity of Copper Harbor, the white pines have all fallen with the ancient forest, struck down by fire or by tornado, and only their huge trunks are left decaying on the earth, under the shade of the young growth that has sprung up to cover the surface anew. It is not at all stunted in its growth by the severity of the northern climate, but attains a diameter and height nearly as great as in its most noted localities. It is unfor- tunate for the interests of the Territory that so little of its soil is heavily timbered with this pine ; yet its deficiency is in some mea- sure made up by the abundance and excellence of the red or Norway pine, which, though by no means as valuable, yet forms a tolerable substitute for the other, when that cannot be provided in abundance. The red pine occurs not only scattered through the mixed forests, but occupying alone tracts of considerable"], [723, "375 [4] extent, and on low sandy plains generally forming \" pine plains,\" in which the trees stand, orchard-like, singly, not far enough apart to prevent their boughs from interlacing at the top, yet leaving free communication among their trunks at the base; the ground under them being quite bare of underbrush, and at most only covered with the low trailing bushes of the whortleberries. The trees on these plains are from seventy to a hundred feet high, with straight, shapely trunks, which are free of branches nearly to the summit, and of size sufficient to furnish very good timber. The other species, Banks's pine, is a rough and scrubby little tree, of no economical value, growing stragglingly on the roughest and barrenest coasts, or more rarely attempting to shoot up after a comelier fashion, on better soil and in good company. Abies, Tourn. balsamea, Marsh. (Balsam Fir.) canadensis, Michx. (Hemlock.) alba, Michx. (White Spruce.) nigra, Poir. (Black Spruce.) The balsam fir is everywhere dis- seminated, forming a greater or less share of nearly every forest, so that it is rarely that the traveller or even explorer pitches his tent at night in a neighborhood where its branches are not to be procured to serve as his mattress. The balsams are conspicuous objects in the forest landscape, their slender-pointed tops being distinctly defined by their darker shade of green amid the brighter foliage about them. The hemlock and spruces are likewise fre- quent, the former choosing the ridges and rocky soil, the latter associated in the swamps with the cedar, or more rarely forming \" spruce plains\" in moist and level grounds, to the exclusion of other species. Of the trio, the white is much the more common. Larix, Tourn. americana, Michx. (Larch, Hacmetack, Tamarack.) The larch is another tree often found in the swamps with the cedar, nowhere, as far as we noticed, attaining a very considerable size. Thuja, Tourn. occidentalis, L. (Arbor Vit\u00e6. White Cedar.) The white cedar, or cedar, as it is generally styled, is perhaps the most abundant and widely and universally diffused of all the trees of the district. It grows in every situation ; on the rough summits of the trap ridges, along the hill sides, on the plains, by the shores, but most espe- cially in the extensive \"cedar swamps\" which cover so consider- able a portion of the face of the country, filling the low grounds everywhere. Wherever there is a tract of plain land of so litt e inclination as not to be readily and thoroughly drained, there is a' cedar-swamp. Nothing is more characteristic of the country, and nothing more troublesome and vexatious to those who journey about it, for the disagreeableness and difficulty of making one's way through such a swamp are extreme. The tangled, crowded mass of cedars, interlacing from the very bottom with their dead, stiff, incorruptible lower limbs, rises up out of a bed of mud and water, varyino-, according to the situation and the season, between ankle- deep and waist-deep, filled with fallen logs and rugged roots, that furnish a deceitful semblance of secure foot. The cedar of thev"], [724, "[4] 376 swamps is a low, scraggy, ugly tree ; in more favorable situations it sometimes attains the height of eighty feet or more, with a diameter at the base of two or three feet. Its wood and bark hold the very first rank for durability ; yet so rough, irregular, and rapid ly tapering are its trunks generally, that it is very difficult to pro cure from them any valuable timber.. Its bark, peeled off in squares, is made much use of for thatching the whole outer sur face of cabins. Juniperus, L. communis, L. (Juniper.) virginiana, L. var. humilis. (Red Cedar.) The latter of the two junipers is found in the vicinity of the lakes only, as a low, pros- trate, creeping shrub ; a variety characteristic of this tree in high latitudes. Taxus, Tourn. canadensis, Willd. (Yew. Ground Hemlock.) The yew is very common, bedding the surface under the shade of the higher forest. It much impedes the progress of the traveller, and is of no value in any way. ARACE\u00c6. Arum, L. triphyllum, L. (Jack-in-the-Pulpitv Calla, L. palustris, L. Not common.

Note A. \u2014 Part I, p. 5. \" The first steps towards the exploration of the country bordering on the great chain of North American lakes were taken by the Jesuits of Canada.\" Three Jesuits and two lay brothers arrived in Canada as early as 1625. The order in Canada as in other countries, had for its head a Superior to whom the missionaries at out-posts regularly reported. The Superior re ported annually to his Provincial, and these reports constitute the Jesuit Relations. These are printed in forty duodecimo volumes under the title of \" Relation de ce qui s'est passe en la Nouvelle France es annees.\" Some times the title runs : \u2014 \" Relation de ce qui s'est passe de plus remarquable aux Missions des Peres de la Compagnie de Jesus en la Nouvelle France, es annees.\" They extend from 1632 to 1672. Of their merit, Charlevoix pronounces the following opinion : \u2014 \"As those fathers were scattered among all the nations with which the French were in relation ; and as then mission obliged them to enter into the affairs of the colony, their memoirs may be said to embrace an elaborate history thereof. There is no other source to which we can apply for instruction as to the progress of religion among the savages, or for a knowledge of these people, all of whose lan guages they spoke. The style of these Relations is exceedingly simple ; but this simplicity itself has not contributed less to give them a great celeb rity, than the curious and edifying ma<' they contain.\"* No historian can enter fully into an investigation of circumstances attendant on the first settlement of this country, without being conversant with them, and those who pretend to acquit themselves of such a task without previously studying these works, afford only a proof of their unfitness for the duty. In proportion to their great value is, at the same time, their great scarcity. A complete set is not now to be found even in the Royal Library at Paris. Southey, at his death, owned twenty-three volumes (1637 to 1671), except ing volume eleven. Bohn purchased this lot for seven pounds, seven shil lings, and- sixpence sterling. In this country, the completest set is owned by Mr. J. C. Brown of Providence, Rhode Island, the volumes for the years 1654-5, 1658-9, and 1671-2 only being wanting. The next in order is that of Harvard College library, there being five volumes wanting. The collection of Mr. J. C. Murphy of Brooklyn is the next in point of completeness, there being eleven volumes wanting. The Relations for the years 1654-5, and 1658-9 are not to be found in any collection, public or private, in this country. \u2022 Historie de la Nor. France, II. XI. VIII.

Some were known to have been written, but the manuscripts were supposed to be lost. The Relations from 1672 to 1679, inclusive, have lately been discovered, and, among them,, a manuscript containing a full account of the voyages of Father Marquette,, and of the discovery by him of the Mississippi river. It was undoubtedly this manuscript which furnished Thevenot the text of his publication, in 1687, of < The Voyages and Discoveries of Father Marquette and Sieur Joylet.' The latter kept a journal and drew a map of their route, but his canoe was upset in the falls of St. Louis, as he was descending the St. Lawrence, in sight of Montreal, and he lost them with the rest of his effects. What increases the value of the present discovery is, that the original narrative goes much more into detail than the one published by Thevenot. The motive which prompted the preparations which were made for the expedition are fully described, and no difficulty is found in tracing the route. There is, also, among the papers, an autograph journal by Marquette, of his last voyage, from the 25th of October, 1674, to the 6th of April, 1675, a month before his singular death, which occurred on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan. Also, a chart of the Mississippi, drawn by himself, illustrating his travels. The one annexed to Thevenot's ac count, above referred to, is manifestly incorrect, and there is a variance between the route of the Jesuit, as traced on his map, and that detailed in the text.

The editor remarks : \" While at Grand island, a few days since, Mr. Williams gave us an ac count of a remarkable instance of the sudden rise and fall of water, at that place, in 1845. On a certain day, without any appearance of wind on the lake, the water rose and fell several times during the day, from four to five feet above high water mark. The weather was calm before and after the occurrence, and this was the case for a hundred miles, at least, to the north west of the island ; for Captain Smith wick, of the schooner Algonquin, was that day off Copper Harbor, and nearly becalmed.\" NoteBI. \u2014 Part II, p. 80.

Artesian wells in the red clay of Green Bay, from Mr. Whittlesey' s MS. In my report made to Dr. Owen in 1849, for that part of Wisconsin east of the Wisconsin river, will be found a statement of the Artesian wells bored by Mr. Alonzo Curtis and others, in the red clay at Fond du Lac, Lake Winnebago.

Whitney and others, near Mr. Beard's, show the same section ; and all, thus far, give a good supply of water. Well of Mr. M. L. Martin, one mile south of the last, surface 'thirty- five feet above the lake, gave, after boring through red clay one hundred and fifteen feet, a supply of water from the quicksand, rising to within seven feet of the surface. Well of Mr. Daniel Whitney, near Manitou river, three feet above the lake : 1: Soil. 2. Red clay - - - - - - 44 feet. 3. Quicksand and water rising above the surface. Well of D. C.

Red clay \u2014 water rises to lake level."], [742, "[4] 394 Well of Jeremiah Porter, five feet above the lake : 1. Sand ------- 14 feet. 2: Red clay 94 \" \u2014 108 feet. 3. Limestone, probably Trenton \u2014 no water. Well of Mr. Daniel Whitney, four feet above the lake 1. Sand 4 feet. 2. Red clay 50 \u00ab 3. Blue sand, with leaves and sticks. A specimen of cedar was given me from a piece eight inches thick - 3 \u00ab 4. Red clay 40 \u00ab 5. Blue clay 11 \u00ab \u2014 108 feet. 6. Trenton limestone \u2014 no water. Another well sunk by Mr. Whitney to the depth of one hundred and six feet, in red and blue clay, struck the rock at that point, but gave no water. Four other wells, on a line of .half a mile north and south, and about on the same level, gave a depth of one hundred and eight feet before striking the rock. In all the cases where no quicksand was met with below the clay, no water was obtained. Mr. Robinson's well is not Artesian, but one of the ordinary kind, in which water filters through the gravel, and fluctuates with the level of the water in the bay. The stratification is evidently very irregular ; for, although the extreme wells are not more than a mile and three-quarters apart, yet the sections vary much, even in the distance of a few rods. In one of the borings, at the depth of forty-three feet, a bed, two feet thick, of rotten wood and leaves, was intersected between strata of red and blue clay. It also con tained the remains of the bones of fishes. The wood was submitted by me to M. Lesquereux, for examination, and pronounced by him to be cedar, and transported by fresh water. Several pieces of the same wood were given me at Appleton, which were also taken from the red clay, but at a height of one hundred to one hundred and fifty feet above the lake. The one above mentioned, however, was found fifty feet below the level of the lake. The alternations of red and blue clay much resemble those of the west side of Lake Michigan, as, for instance, at Racine and Milwaukee ; and it is evident that they both belong to one formation. Since, therefore, the great clay deposits of Lake Michigan graduate, on the south, into the blue marly sand and clay of Lake Erie, and on the north into the red marly clays of Lake Superior, it follows that they ought to be considered to be of the same age. Those on Lake Erie and the streams flowing into it, contain the same wood as those of Lake Michigan, and also a few fresh-water and land shells. It follows, therefore, that the Lake Superior clays are also of fresh water and not of marine origin. In the vicinity of Green Bay, the red clay may be seen at a height of one hundred and fifty feet above the lake ; but, on ascending Fox river, its surface rises, and on the hills south-east of Lake Winnebago, it attains a height of four hundred feet. On the waters of Fox river, the bricks made \u00abom it are of a cream-color, like those of Milwaukee, when hard-burnt,"], [743, "395 [4] otherwise they are red. The color of these red and blue clays is due to iron in different stages of oxidation. They all contain more or less car bonate of lime and magnesia. Pebbles of the sedimentary rocks are also sparsely distributed through them, as well as some fragments of the north ern igneous and azoic rocks. The principle upon which water rises in the wells of Green Bay and Fond du Lac, is very simple : A bed of quicksand, or some other material into which water can penetrate, is confined between impervious Strata above and below; wherever the edges of the first mentioned stratum come to the surface, they are penetrated by the water, which gradually fills the whole of the permeable mass in which it is confined, as a reservoir. Of course, if the superior bed is bored through, the water will rise nearly as high as the edge of the bed which is filled with water, according to the well-known laws of hydrostatics. At Appleton, on the Fox river, wells are bored, which either give no water, or it only rises in them a part of the distance to the surface. But then the river is near, and has cut through the clay to the underlying sand stone, so that the water finds, in part, a natural outlet from the beds of quicksand. A few observations have been made on the temperature of these wells. At Oshkosh we found, in September, 1849, that the water of a well thirty feet deep was at 48\u00b0, Fahrenheit, in July, according to Mr. M. Williams, a well ninety feet deep gave the same temperature, and in the January following, 51\u00b0, F. Note G. \" Fisheries of Lakes Michigan and Superior.\" The number of persons engaged in this business is very variable, as well as the quantity of fish caught. Fishermen say that the same ground is much better one year than another, so that they are obliged to shift their quarters. We saw at Pointe au Cheiie, Biddle river, Payment Point, Point Patterson, at the harbor west of Bark Point and many other places, aban doned fishing stations ; but these may all be resumed during the present year. There were fishermen at the island of St. Helena, Gull island, and others in the lake, not within our course, whose number we cannot state. They had thus far been unsuccessful, the fish having retired far out into the deep and cool water. At Seul Choix, there was a greater assemblage of men and boats than at any other point in our route. From the best estimates, there were at Seul Choix, ... 90 boats and 200 men.

On the west shore of Green Bay and the west shore of the lake, south of Death's Door, there are also fishing stations. Altogether there must be nearly a thousand persons engaged in this pur suit. The fish here taken are the white-fish and Mackinac trout. (Mr. Whittlesey' s MS.) On Lake Superior there are fisheries at White-fish Point, Grand island, La Pointe, and Isle Royale, where considerable quantities are taken and exported ; but we have no statistics as to the number of men employed, or the number of barrels exported. Between the head of Keweenaw Point and the mouth of the Ontonagon river, considerable quantities of fish are taken, for which there is a ready market at the mining stations. In addi tion to the white-fish and Mackinac trout, the siskawit is occasionally ta ken. Its favorite resort, however, is the deep water in the vicinity of Isle Royale. Note H. Statistics of Lumber. There are eight saw-mills in operation along the southern coast of the Upper peninsula, viz : One at the mouth of the Manistee, running - - 2 saws. One at Sturgeon river, (Bay des Noquets,) running - 1 saw. One at Escanaba river, running 4 saws One at White-fish river, running - - - 2 \" One at Fort river, running - - - - 2 \" One at Cedar river, running - - - - 3 \" Two at Menomonee river, running - - - 7 \" 21 At Cedar river and the Menomonee, there are lathe machines, and prob ably at others. The best saws cut from 4000 to 6000 feet of lumber in twenty-four hours, while running ; but the mills generally lie still during winter, and from breakages and other causes are not in operation at all times during the remainder of the season. There is an excellent belt of pine lands, extending from the Manistee to the Menomonee and thence to the Wisconsin and even the Mississippi, but towards the sources of these streams the timber is less abundant and valu able.\u2014 (Mr. Whittlesey's MS.) Note I. Origin and Orthography if some of the proper Names in the Lake Supe- rior District. Hardly anything has more perplexed us than the difficulty of ascertaining the correct names of the prominent natural features of our district, and of"], [745, "397 L 4 J writing them as they are pronounced, so as, at the same time, to preserve the original meaning. While very few of the small lakes, rivers, or hills, in the interior, have as yet received any names ; almost all the streams, points, and bays, along the coast of the great lakes, are known by some name, generally either of Indian or French derivation. Many of these are now so corrupted from their original designation, that it is impossible ever to restore the correct spelling, or to bring again into use the original name. As the race, by which most of the conspicuous points and rivers were named, is rapidly disappearing, we deem it worth while to place on record such information as we have been able to obtain, either from the natives (Chippeways or Ojibwas), or from our voyageurs (Canadian French, or French and Indian), or from the published works of the old explorers of this region, and especially of the Jesuit fathers. How many of the great topographical features of this country retain their aboriginal names, while the meaning of those names has become irrevocably lost ! In Part I. of this report we have given a sac-simile of the map of this region, made by the Jesuit missionaries, probably about the years 1670 and 1671, and published in Paris in 1672. The astonishing amount of geogra phical knowledge of the borders of these lakes, obtained by the earliest explorers, speaks volumes for their skill and perseverance. Some of the maps published in this country and in England, within the last ten years, do not exhibit the main features of Lake Superior as correctly as they are shown on the old Jesuit map. From these old Jesuit authorities, especially the \"Lettres edifiantes,\" and from Charlevoix, \"Journal d'un Voyage,\" &c, we have gleaned what information we could, with regard to the original designation and meaning of the names. In giving the abstract, we will begin at Saut Ste Marie, and, following the northern shore of Lake Superior toward the west, make the circuit of that lake, and then follow the northern shores of Huron and Michigan, towards the west, along the southern borders of our district, to Green Bay. Lake Superior (Lac Sup'erieur, Fr., Kitchi-gummi, Ch.). \u2014 The name upon the Jesuit map is \"Lac Tracy ov Svperievr.\" Lac Sup'erieur means simply, Upper Lake. Lac Tracy seems to indicate a desire on the part of the Jesuits to perpetuate the name of M. de Tracy, by giving it to the largest sheet of fresh water on the globe. We need hardly add, that the name of Lake Tracy was never adopted, and is quite unknown. ' Kitchi-gummi signifies Great water or Great lake, gummi being, in general, a collection of water, or lake. Saut Ste. Marie (Le Sault, Mission de Ste. Marie du Sault, Jesuit map). \u2014 Sault is the old French orthography. The French name seems now finally adopted by the inhabitants at the Saut, or Soo, as it is frequently pronounced. The river, on the other hand, is known by the English name \u2014 St. Mary's river. The Indians at the Saut are called Les Sauteurs. Gros Cap. \u2014 A name given by the voyageurs to innumerable projecting headlands ; but in this case appropriately, since it is the conspicuous feature at the entrance of the lake. Goulais Bay. \u2014 Derivation doubtful ; perhaps goulet, the funnel-shaped opening of a net, from some fancied resemblance in its form. Batcheewauaung Bay. \u2014 Derivation unknown. Mamainse (Indian). \u2014 Little sturgeon."], [746, "I [ 4 ] 398 \u00ab Michipicoten (Great sand) Bay. \u2014 Not descriptive of the island, but of the river. Neepigon Bay. \u2014 Neepi or nipt is water ; neepigon, dirty water. Kamanistiquia. \u2014 \"River that goes far about.\" Serpentine. Le Pate. \u2014 Pie island, or Pastry island, from its fancied resemblance to a French pie. The island rises from the water to the height of eight hun dred feet, with regular and slightly sloping sides, like a hat; and the term, \" Hat island,\" would convey a better idea to the American reader, of its outline, than that now in use. Isle Royale. \u2014 Isle Minong on Jesuit map. Minong is said to mean Great island. Another explanation is, that it means an island which is inter sected in passing from one point to another. Thus one in voyaging down the north shore might pass from Pigeon river to Washington harbor, and, following along the shore of this island to its eastern extremity, make the traverse to Point Porphyry. It is very curious to observe that, on the map of the great lakes published in Charlevoix's Journal (1744) another large island of nearly the same size and shape as Isle Royale is inserted about half way between Keweenaw Point and Isle Royale. To this island, which is not on the Jesuit map, published sixty years before, the name of Isle Philip peaux is given, and it figures to this day on some of the European maps. This same error, if we recollect aright, is perpetuated in Henry's work, pub lished in 1822. Montreal R. \u2014 The name Montreal is one which is most frequently given by the voyageurs, in memory of their home, and the head-quarters of the Hud son's Bay Company. Indian Ka-wa-si-gi-nong sipi, or River of the White Falls, alluding' to the fine fall near the mouth of the river and visible from the lake. Chaquamegon (Cha-ga-wa-mi-kong). \u2014 Narrow pointed bay. Kargwajiwing. \u2014 Porcupine mountains. Karg is the Chippeway for por cupine, probably given from the great abundance of these animals in the region, and deservedly. Agogebic ( Little fish) lake. Ontonagon, R. \u2014 Nagon or nogon, signifies cup or dish, but whence the origin or what the meaning of the whole word, we have never been able satisfactorily to learn. Spelled on the Jesuit map Nantounagan. Keweenaw Point. \u2014 On many maps Keweewaiwona. Kiouchounaning, Jesuit map. Pronounced by our Indians, Ki-wi-wai-non-ing, now written and pronounced as above ; meaning a portage, or a place where a portage is made. The whole distance of some eighty or ninety miles around the point, being saved by entering Portage lake and following up a small stream, leav ing a portage of only about a half a mile to Lake Superior on the other side. Eagle River. \u2014 The name giveh| by the voyageurs is La riviere nid d'digle, Eagle's-nest river. Manitou Island, supposed to be one of the residences of the Indian goblin. Agate Harbor. \u2014 Indian name, Na-jo-wi-kue-do-wang, or Double bay. Kewainoquot harbor, generally called Horse-shoe harbor, a few miles cast of Copper harbor, a beautiful little boat harbor. Indian name explained to us as signifying Flying clouds. Bete grise Bay. \u2014 Hardly any name on Lake Superior is written in so many different ways, but never as actually pronounced. The invariable pro nunciation in the Lake Superior region is as if written \" Bay Degree.\" The"], [747, "399 [4] name is said to have been given from some gray animal seen in that vicinity, and to be written correctly must be \"Baie de la Bete grise,\" or \"Bete grise bay.\" The Indian name is Ba-ghi-da-wi-i-ning, a bay where nets are set ; there being here excellent fishing ground. Torch Lake, Ba-ki-ga-mang, in allusion to spearing fishes by torch-light Sturgeon River, Name Sepi. Tobacco River. \u2014 Wa-sa-ko-di-na-bi-kon, or Burnt-stone river, from the red sandstone at its mouth ; the former given in allusion to the dark brown color of its swampy water. Fall River. Me-ta-bi-ki-ti-goei-ang Sepi, or Shallow river. L'Anse. \u2014 Anse is bay, \u2014 \"une tres petite baie qui s'enforce peu dans les terres.\" Diet. Fr. Accd. It is applied to many indentations of the coast. but for the most part, it has reference to the settlements at the head of Ke weenaw bay. Point Abbaye. \u2014 A corruption of Point aux Baies, a name very commonly given by the voyageurs to a point, on each side of which there is a bay. In dian name Kitchi-ni-ia-sing. Big Point. Lake Michigan (Lac de Ilinois, Jesuit map). \u2014 Probably the significa tion is the same as that of Lake Superior \u2014 michi, vast ; gummi, water. Manistee River and Lake. \u2014 This name has been generally spelt on the map, Monistique. The name is pronounced by those residing at the mouth of the river, Manistee. It is written also by Charlevoix, la Manistie. This we think sufficient authority for changing it. The name, as explained to us by ourlndians, means, \" A river at whose mouth are islands.' There is, at least, one other river of this name emptying into Lake Michigan. Seul Choix Point. \u2014 The only choice ; in allusion to the few spots along the coast suitable for landing. Properly written, Seule Choix. Bark Point, near Point Detour. Not Pointe aux Barques, but Pointe aux Ecorces, in French. Bay des Noquets. \u2014 This is the proper name of this bay, but it is univer sally pronounced in that region as it is written, Bay de Noque, or Nock in English. The following quotation from Charlevoix shows that this is a very ancient name: \u2014 \"Nous nous embarquames le deux de Juillet apres midi, nous cotoyames pendant trente lieues une Langue de terre qui separe le Lac Michigan du Lac Superieur, elie n'a en bien des endroits que quelques lieues de large, et il n'est queres possible de voir un plus mauvais Pays ; mais il est termine par une jolie riviere nomme la Manistie, fort poisson neuse, et qui abonde sur tout en Esturgeons. Un peu plus loin, en tiran* au Sud-Ouest, en entre dans un grand Golphe, dont PEntree est bordee dlsles, on le nomme le Golphe, ou la Baye des Noquets. C'est une tres petite nation, venue des bords du Lac Superieur, et dont il ne reste plus que quelques Families dispersees <;a et la, sans avoir de demeuse fine. La Baye des Noquets n'est separee de la Grande Baye, que par les Isles des Pouteouatamis.\" \u2014 P.de Charlevoix, \"Journal d'un Voyage,\" fye, vol. 5, p. 429. Traine River (Riviere la Traine). \u2014 Traine is the old French term for sleigh or sledge \u2014 traineau. Nekomenon, or Dead River (Riviere du Mort). \u2014 Probably named from some tradition of a dead man found near its mouth. Laughing-fish River (Riviere du Poisson qui rit). \u2014 The origin of this singular name we are at a loss to understand."], [748, "i 4] 400 Tequamenon. \u2014 On Jesuit map, Outakoniman ; meaning unknown. Green Bay. \u2014 The name of this bay on the Jesuit map is \" Baye des Puans,\" the \"Puans\" being the not over-cleanly Indians who inhabited its borders. Menomonee River \u2014 Indian \u2014 equivalent to Wild-rice river. On Jesuit map, \"Riviere des Oumalouminee, ou de la folle avoine.\" Escanaba River. \u2014 Flat-rock, or Smooth-stone river. Name given in allusion to the geological peculiarities of the river, as described in the pre ceding pages of this report. Machigamig River. \u2014 A river flowing from a great lake. Spelt on various maps, Michigamig and Peshekemme. Machigummi, or Michigummi. \u2014 Great lake. Night- watching (Mibe-go-mi-nini) River. \u2014 A branch of the Machi gamig, so called because the Indians were wont to watch for game on its banks by moonlight. Fence River (Indian, Mitchikau). \u2014 A branch of the Machi-gamig. The name, Fence river, alludes to the manner of catching the deer, by building a long line of fence diagonally to the river, and abutting against it, so that the deer are concentrated at one point. Pemenee (Elbow). \u2014 Falls of the Menomonee river, where the river bends like an elbow. Bekuenesec (Smoky). \u2014 Name given to a waterfall on the Menomonee, in allusion to the spray rising like smoke. Swampy River (Wabashkiki). Jack-fish (Ki-no-je-si-kauing) Lake. \u2014 So called from a species of Esox (pickerel) inhabiting it in great abundance. Note J. EEEATA\u2014 PAET I.
