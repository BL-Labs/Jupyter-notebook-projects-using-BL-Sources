The South Eastern Railway Company was incorporated by 6 William IV., c. 75 (21st June, 1836), as the South Eastern and Dover. The original scheme commenced at Red Hill Junction, and terminated near Dover. In 1839 the Com- pany obtained power to run over the Croydon Line (from Croydon to Red Hill in the parish of Reigate). This section of tire railway was originally constructed by the Brighton Company, but the South Eastern Company afterwards purchased for \u00a3340,000 (with interest on the cost up to the date of purchase) one-half of the length, and also contributed a share of the expense of erecting the joint station at London Bridge. In 1843 the extension to Dover (making the length of the main line 88 miles), the branch to Maidstone, and the purchase of the Bricklayers' Arms Station were authorized. Powers were secured for the Canterbury, Ramsgate and Margate, and Folkestone Harbour Branches in 1844 ; the Tunbridge Wells (in the following year supplemented by authority to extend to Hastings), Minster and Deal, and Ashford and Hastings Branches in 1845 ; and the North Kent (with its exten- sions) in 1^46. The Reigate, Guildford and Reading Railway was purchased in 1852, and the Whitstable Branch and Continental Steam Packet Service iu 1853. On the 30th of June, 1863, the South Eastern Company obtained Parliamentary sanction for new lines to Tunbridge and Dartford. Tlie first-named line was pro- jected with the object of shortening the journey to Dover. It was opened as far as Chislehurst in June, 1865 ; to Sevenoaks in March, 1868 ; and to Tunbridge (then becoming the direct main line \u2014 the section to Tunbridge via Croydon and Red Hill being described as the old main liue) iu May, 1868. The Dartford Branch was . .rst used for public traffic on the 1st of September, 1866. The City (Cannon Street) and West End (Charing Cross) extensions were originally undertakeu by a district company. By the terms of an Act passed on the 8th of August, ] 859, the South Eastern Company subscribed \u00a3300,000 to the Charing Cross undertaking, and agreed to participate in its management and work the line when opened. The Cannon Street extension was authorized on the 25th of June, 1861, the South Eastern contributing a further sum of \u00a3250,000. These amounts were supplemented by a third contribution of \u00a3350,000 \u2014 making in all \u00a3900,000\u2014 in May, 1861. In 1863 the Company obtained an Act to amalgamate the Charing Cross scheme, fusion being effected shortly after. The line from Charing Cross to London Bridge was opened for traffic in August, 1864; and that into Cannon Street on the 1st of September, 1866."], [20, "X The dates of autho.ization, and other information respeotiug the principal short as under bra nches of the South Eastern system, are Tbe Company are authorized under the Act of August 11th, 1876, to extend the Hythe and Sandgate Branch to Folkestone Harbour, thus giving an alternative route from Westenhanger to that point.

The Hundred of Hoo Bailway (incorporated July 21st 1879) from Shorne near Higham to the Isle of Grain opposite Sheerness (about 13 miles in length) is in course of construction. It will terminate with a pier and landing place, to be named Port Victoria, from whence a direct German and Belgian steam ship service will be organized.

Five hotels are owned by the Company \u2014 namely, Charing Cross Terminus ; Cannou Street Terminus; the Pavilion, Folkestone Harbour; the Lord Warden, Dover; and the Seabrook, Hythe. All are magnificent establishments, replete with the most recent facilities of hotel accommodation, but not lackiug the comforts of English home life. The two first named form the entrances to the statious from which they take their designation, and are a combination of Italian and Gothic styles of archi tecture \u2014 principally the former. That of Charing Cross contains 250 sleeping-apart ments and about as many private and other rooms ; it gives employment to more than 200 persons; and there are complete provisions for guarding against fire. Cannon Street Hotel is, in most of its features, a reproduction of the Charing Cross building. Both were built from the designs of Mr. E. M. Barry, and completed for use shortly after the opening of the sections of the liue with which they are imme diately connected. A reminiscence of the Eleanor Cross, which in ancient times stood near the site of the terminus at Charing Cross, is perpetuated by a beautiful facsimile in the centre of the open space fronting the hotel. The Pavilion at Folkestone is a somewhat old-fashioned but luxurious hotel (built by tho Company), with which few in the provinces eau compete for size, splendour, and convenience ; it is specially suitable for winter residence. The Lord Warden Hotel, at Dover, is a structure which, from its massive yet elegant style, unrivalled position, and excellent internal arrangements, has attained a reputation enviable as it is deserved. The Seabrook Hotel, at Hythe, opened in 1880, and under the direct management of the Compau)'-, possesses an unparalleled situation, and possesses every advantage which can aid in ensuring its acceptance as a favourite residence both in summer and winter. There is no railway in the kingdom \u2014 and, it may be added, with little room for contradiction, \" in the world\" \u2014 of the same extent which presents such varied and striking examples of engineering skill and scientific construction as the South Eastern. On the journey between Charing Cross and Dover, by the main line, feats of human genius can be observed which are not to be surpassed anywhere in talent of design and ability of accomplishment : they inelude the Charing Cross Hotel, Station, and Bridge ; the Cannon Street Hotel, Station, and Bridge ; the continuous viaduct from Lambeth to Spa Road, 3 miles in length ; the Sevenoaks Tunnel, 3,453 yards or nearly two miles in length (its lineal dimensions are exceeded in the United Kingdom by only three other tunnels); the \"straight road\" between Paddock Wood and Ashford \u2014 a section of the line which would be mathematically precise in its course for 25 miles but for an almost imperceptible curve at Staplehurst ; the Ford Valley Viaduct near Folkestone ; and the tunnels and sea walls between Folkestone and Dover. The Charing Cross Terminus and Bridge were commenced in 1860. The latter is 1,350 feet long, and comprises nine spans \u2014 six of 154 feet and three of 100 feet. It is mainly supported by cylinders sunk into the bed of the river ; but the brick piers of the old Hungerford Bridge, wliich it supplanted, were incorporated in its design \u2022md execution. The greatest depth of water between these piers is 13 feet below low water spriug tides, and the average depth about 10 feet. The level of tlie rails is 31 feet above Trinity high-water mark, and the clear minimum headway 25 feet above the same level. No less than 4,950 tons of wrought iron (including steel pins) and 1,950 tons of cast iron were used in the building of the bridge. The station-shed is 450 feet long by 170 wide, aud covered by an arched glas3 and iron roof as bold in its dimensions as that of tho Islington Agricultural Hall. It stands upon a series of wide and massive arches, which have be?n utilized for a variety of purposes, and_ produce a large revenue to the Company. The-cost of the bridge was \u00a3160,000. It was designed by Mr. Hawkshaw, President of the Institution of Civil Engineers. The cost of the hotel and station was \u00a3320,' '00. The Cannon Street Bridge and Station very closely resemble those at Charing- Cross. The bridge is 700 feet long between the abutments. The piers, from tho bottom of tho cylinders to the bed-plate girdt rs, contain about 2,500 tons of cast and wrought iron ; the superstructure contains s.bout 4,200 tons of wrought iron.in"], [23, "XIII girders, floor plates, (fee, and about 1,100 tons of ornamental castings in cantilevers, railings, pillars, cfcc. The roadway carries five lines of rails, and the cost of the works, with the exception of the permanent way and signals and signal apparatus, amounted to \u00a3193,000. The dimensions of the station-shed slightly exceed those of the Charing Cross shed. The elevation of the London Bridge Station (the headquarters of the Company) is in the Italian style, but rather unpretending. It consists of three stories, terminating with an ornament \\\\ cornice, and surmounted by a clock. The station buildings, which are jointly owned by the South Eastern and Brighton Companies, stands upon an artificial terrace or platform reared upon a massive superstructure of piers and arches which extends to a depth of 40 feet below the railway. In this stupendous work moro than eight millions of bricks were consumed. The train platforms are covered with wood aud glass roofs. There aro no less than 38 tunnels on the railway, eleven alone being on the main line. First iu importance and costliness is the wonderfu 1 passage through the North Downs at Sevenoaks, which is only 69 yards short of being two miles in length. The Polhill Tunnel, north of Sevenoaks, is 2,609 yards long ; Abbotts Cliff Tunnel, between Folkestone and Dover, is 1,933 yards ; Merstham Tunnel, near Red Hill, pierced throughout its whole length by the blasting process, 1,832 yards; and the Shakspeare Cliff Tunnel, at Dover, 1,392 yards. The portion of the line between Folkestone and Dover excites greater attention and secures more interest than any other, not only on account of the fine marine view which it furnishes, but also by reason of the immense difficulties that were overcome in its formation. From the moment the train leaves Folkestone Station it proceeds alternately through chalk cliffs andover artificial embankments of the. same material, so strong as to have successfully resisted the storms of the Channel since the day they were made. The tunnels are four in number : \u2014 the Martello (530 yards) ; the Abbott's Cliff (1,933 yards) ; the Shakspeaie Cliff\u2014 so named from the dramatist's supposed description of it in the tragedy of \"King Lear \" \u2014 (1,392 yards) ; and the Arch Cliff (66 yards) ; \u2014 a total length of 3,921 yards of tunnel in the distance of 8,800 lineal yards of road between the two stations. The Shakspeare Cliff Tunnel is of peculiar construction \u25a0 it consists of two separate flutes, each thirty feet high, and of Saracenic architecture, faced throughout with brickwork \u2014 except in such places where the hardness of the chalk rendered such precautions unnecessary \u2014 the whole being ventilated by seven shafts sunk perpendicularly from the surface of the cliff, and the same number of lateral outlets towards its face, originally made for throwing the excavated matter into the sea. The sea-wall on the Folkestone side is one of the largest works of its kind in England ; it is nearly thr-ou-quarters of a mile long, and elevated from sixty to seventy feet above the beach, being composed en tirely of flint and shingles, consolidated into a compact mass witli lime, thrown down to form the seatings ofthe cliff. Most of this chalk was obtained by the blasting of Roundown Cliff, which was effected by the use of 1,900 lbs. of gunpowder, causing the disintegration of no less than 400,000 cubic yards of rock, which in ten seconds was distributed over eighteen acres of beach. The Company saved about \u00a37,000 in labour v, ages by this skilful and peculiar plan of forming a solid road. The viaduct on the Dover side, between Shakspeare and Arch Cliff Tunnels, though of a different and smaller character, is no less interesting as a result of engineering science ; it is about half a mile long, and formed of heavy beams of timber securely framed and bolted together, but left open so as to offer less resistance to the waves, which fre- quently expend their tremendous force along the whole length of the shore covered by the staging. The lofty viaduct which spans the Ford Valley, south of Folkestone Station, consists of nineteen slender brick arches varying from 40 to 100 feet iu height, surmounted by plain parapets. The town of Folkestone has extended to the village of \"Ford, and the viaduct is now surrounded by houses, &c. As the ground on either side slopes rapidly towards the valley, the lofty embankments which were here necessary to maintain the level of the railway add to the apparent depth of the piers and arches, and give them an air of grandeur they would not otherwise posse ss. The viaduct"], [24, "XIV was built from the plans of Sir William Cubitt, who also designed the sea-walls and tunnels between Folkestone and Dover. The Locomotive and Carriage works* of the Company are at Ashford Junction, a little to the south-west of the station. Between a thousand and twelvo hundred artisans and labourers are employed therein. The natural attractions afforded by the routes of the South Eastern Railway and its branches areas numerous as they are diversified. The precipitous and lock bound coast line \u2014 from the North Foreland to Hastings \u2014 varied here aud there with bustling ports, picturesque fishing-villages, fashionable marine resorts, ancient strongholds and fortifications, and enchanting inland prospects ; the verdant slopes and wooded knolls of the north Downs, extending from Guildford to Tunbridge ; and the sylvan vales and undulating parklauds \u2014 embosoming rustic hamlets \u2014 historic cities and mansions, aud venerable ruins of the Wealds of Kent and Sussex, all make up an enticing programme for the tourist aud pleasure-seeker, and aro material factors, with unsurpassed Continental communications and valuable commercial connections, in ensuring a continuanco of that successful career, which from the date of its opening, nearly half a century ago, has distinguished this popular \" Iron Road.\" Lrist ot the lunnels on tho South Eastern Railwai7 (with their length in yards) : \u2014 Main LrxE.

Lug gage cannot be registered from London beyond Paris; Luggage coming from Switz erlaud is examined at the frontiers of the neighbouring States. Luggage may ba registered through from Paris to Turin or Milan and examined at Modane, and coming from Turin it is examined at Modane, or in some eases it is examined on arrival at Paris. In returning from the Continent to London the luggage is examined at Boulogne and Dover on Sundays whenever the arrival at those places occurs between the Saturday and Sunday afternoon ordinary services. Where the passenger in tends to stop short of the final destination shown by his through ticket, he should register only to the first point at which he desires to break the journey.

Passengers should especially note that baggage registered for the German stations will not be forwarded beyond Aix-la-Chapelle or Cologne until examined by the Customs there, ivhich can only be done in the presence of the owner or person acting for him. The owner is liable in Belgium and Germany to a duty of about ls. 6d. per 100 lbs. weight. Passengers who register their baggage for Cologne, and who subsequently desire to have it at Brussels, should claim it at Blandain or Mous cron, where, as a favour, it may be given up by the station master. At Lille, pas sengers are required to say by what route they wish to proceed \u2014 either via Ghent or Tournay \u2014 in order that the baggage may be put in the proper wagon.

Notwithstanding the above regulations, all trunks or parcels which have to pass a frontier, must be given up at starting, and are conveyed in the Customs' truck. This regulation applies even to hat boses and necessaries. Any luggage Tcept in the carriages up to any frontier town \u2014 for instance, Verviers \u2014 must be re-booked there, and is sent on by an after train, as express goods. Some French Goods \u2014 as New Clothes, Millinery, Printed or Dyed Cotton, Woollen and Linen Fabrics, Silk, <fcc. \u2014 are charged at a reduced rate of duty on entering Belgium. But to obtain this reduction, it is necessary to have a certificate, termed \" certificat d'origine'' from the French Customs, and to present this with the goods at the Belgian Customs. On this system, Silk, for instance, pays 4 francs instead of 10 for each kilogramme. Travellers can obtain the necessary paper at the Bureau de la Douane, at Paris.

Demeanour. \u2014 To insure that world-renowned civility from French servants, officials and others, the visitor should be thoroughly courteous when making a request, or even when ordering refreshments at a cafe or restaurant. It is customary to address even persons of the lower classes as Monsieur, Madame, or Mademoiselle. The policemen, who are to be met with in every street and place of public resort, are always ready tc furnish strangers with every information in their power. Cabs and Public Carriages, \u2014 Paris is well supplied with public carriages of all kinds. The omnibuses are numerous and well-conducted, but slow. The price is. 30 c. (3d.) for the inside places, and 15 c. for the outside (imperiale). Almost all are in correspondence, and the passengers may claim a ticket of correspondence to go on by another omnibus if the one he gets into does not reach his destination. Care should be taken to tell the conductor on entering what part of Paris it is desired to reach. The omnibuses of the various lines are all indicated by letters of the alphabet, and colours. These different colours are used in the various quarters or divisions of Paris for all public purposes. \"For fiacres or cabs, the fares are about one shilling for the course, as it is called, if not exceeding a quarter of an hour, and a little more for the longer courses. The price per hour is 2 frs. Full statements of the fares will be found suspended in all the carriages, and the driver must give the passenger a printed ticket of particulars, <fcc. The prices are nearly double between midnight and 6 a.m. in summer, or 7 a.m. in winter. Besides the fiacres (or voitures de place), there are a somewhat superior class of vehicles, belonging to private individuals, and known as voitures de remise. They are better fitted and travel more quickly. The fare for the short course is 1 fr. 50 c, for the longer 2 frs. By the hour 2 fr. 25 c. The visitor to Paris should learn the colour that belongs to the lanterns of the quarter of the city he resides in, and select cabs with lanterns of this colour on returning home. Places of Amusement. \u2014 The following establishments are the most frequented : \u2014 Conservatoire de Musique (classical music) ; Herz, Sainte-Ce'cile, Pre Catelan, Erard, Pleyel and Sox concert halls. The concerts of the Cafes Chantants are of an inferior description. Those in the Champ-Elysees attract numerous visitors in summer. The foUowing are among the best establishments : Eldorado, Alcazar, Cafe-Concert Bataclan, and Gi-and Concert Parisien. Of Soirees Musicales et Dansantes, the most frequented in summer are Jardin Mabille (balls on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays ; admission, 3 and 5 francs) ; Closerie des Lilas, {Jardin Bullier) ; the Chateau Rouge. In winter : Salle Valentino Casino, rua Cadet; Elysee-Montniai-tre. The Cascade Cafe', in tho Bois de Boulogne, and the Casino d'Asnieres are favourite summer resorts. The Masked Balls of the Grand Opera last from the middle of December till Lent, and take place every Saturday evening (admission 10 fr.). Theatres. \u2014 There are nearly 50 in Paris. The performances commence at various hours between 6 and 8 o'clock, and last till midnight. The best places are the stalls in. front of the orchestra (fauteuils d'orchestre), behind which are the stalles d'orchestre ; those behind the pit (stalles d'amphithe'dtre), and those in front of the first tier of boxes (fauteuils de balcon, de la premiere galerie). Ladies are not admitted in some theatres to the orchestra stalls. In the case of popular performances, seats should be secured by purchasing billets de location beforehand at the location office des theatres. These billets cost 1 or 2 francs more than those bought at the door, but the purchaser thereby reserves his seat. Hotels, Cafes, and Restaurants. \u2014 Although attendance is always an item in the hotel-bill, it is usual to give the head-waiter and the concierge a fee of 1 or 2"], [31, "XXI frs. per week, and the under-waiter by whom the traveller has been served, about 2 frs. In a few instances the payment for service is left to the discretion of the traveller, who is expected to give J or 1 fr. daily. Au occasional extra gratuity will greatly tend to ensure civility. Visitors should avoid keeping articles of value in the drawers or cupboards of their rooms. They should be entrusted to the care of the landlord, or sent to a banker. The cafe's of Paris are one of the characteristic features of the city. They are to be found in all quarters of the town, and some are fitted up with great splendour. They are adapted for the entertainment of all classes of society. Billiards, cribbage and dominoes are allowed in Parisian cafe's. The traveller should select restaurants of the best class, at which a simple repast of 2 or 3 courses may be obtained for a reasonable sum. The visitor is not expected to drink expensive wines. The waiter expects about 1 sou on each franc spent. Ladies \u2022can dine at restaurants without attracting the observation which is so noticeable in London establishments. Money, Weights, and Measures. \u2014 The French coinage is very simple, and easily understood; it is divided into tenths, on the decimal system. The coins \u25a0consist of centimes (a \" sous \" is equal to 5 centimes) and francs. 100 centimes \u2022(or 20 sous) make a franc. 20 franc gold pieces were formerly styled Napoleons. For all ordinary dealings the visitor may calculate the franc as worth led. in English money. As the franc is actually worth only 9-Jd., if a halfpenny be taken off the value of each franc in making a calculation, the exact British equivalent will be found. The coinage system of Belgium, Italy, and Switzerland are similar to those of France, and equivalent in value. Tbe franc becomes lira (singular), and lire (plural) ; the centime, centesimi, in Italian. In Holland 5 cents are about equivalent to ld. ; 1 florin or guilder (100 cents) to about Is. 7d. ; 1 gold ducat to about 9s. 4d.; and 1 gold 10- florin piece to about 16s. 6d. In Germany 12 pfennige are about equivalent to ld. ; 1 mark (100 pfennige) to ls. ; 20-mark piece (gold) to \u00a31. The kilogramme, or kilo, as it is generally called, is the French ordinary weight by which goods sold by weight are quoted. It is equal to 2 lb3. 3\\ ozs. avoirdupois ; a pound of any article is nearly equivalent to about a demi-kilo, which is 1 lb. IJ oz. avoirdupois. The unit of length is the metre, which is about 39 inches English ; 5-J metres, nearly 6 yards ; 10 metres, 11 yards. The metre is divided into 100 centimetres. The kilometre is the road measure \u2014 3 miles are equal nearly to 5 kilometres ; 8 kilometres are 5 miles ; 10 kilometres are 6 J miles ; 100 kilometres, 63 miles. The \u25a0same measurement is also used in Belgium, Italy, Portugal and Spain. Liquid and dry measures are calculated by the litre, about 1| pint. An ordinary .French wine bottle contains about a litre."], [32, "\u00e6-m LONDON HACKNEY CARRIAGE REGULATIONS, AND LIST OF FARES, TO AND FROM THE PRINCIPAL RAILWAY STATIONS' TO THE POINTS NAMED.

ABBEY WOOD\u2014 (STATION.)\u2014 This place is a hamlet within the civil parish of Erith and the ecclesiastical district of Belvedere, in the county of Kent (see under both these heads). It comprises a portion of Lesness Heath, (which gives name to the hundred), and is renowned for the monastery which once existed here. Some extensive frag ments of boundary wall comprise the sole remains of this once thriving estab lishment. Lesness Abbey was founded ia the year 1178, by Richard de Lucy, Lord Chief Justice of England in the reign of Henry IL, and during the king's absence in France, regent of the kingdom. It was one of the first religious houses swept off at the Reformation, and its revenues of nearly \u00a3200 per annum went to endow Wolsey's new college at Oxford. Oa the fall of the cardinal, however, the abbey estates were given to William Brereton, a gentleman of the Privy Chamber, and eventually, in the reign of Charles I., came into the possession of Sir John Hippesley. At this time an inte resting discovery was made by some workmen, who, in digging, found \" a goodly funerall monument\" of a man in coat armour, supposed by Wee ver to be the monument of Richard de Lucy, founder of Lesness. This, with other curious relics found at the same time, was, it is said, buried again, but all traces of them have been lost, From certain indications in the boundary wall, it would appear that the church was originally about 40 feet wide and 97 feet in length, and that the tower, a structure only about 17 feet square, abutted against the northern side of the church, between the nave and the chancel, of which it formed a compouent part. A doorway, apparently of the time of Edward I., still exists at the south-western corner of the garden, and seems to have been the principal en trance into the abbey, opening into the cloisters beneath the refectory, which stood on the southern side of tho quad rangle, opposite the church, the kitchen adjoining. The dormitory surmounted the cloisters, and the rest of the buildings contained the chapter-house and the conventual offices. The convent garden still remains enclosed within its ancient boundary wall. The abbey and manor now belong to Christ's Hospital. The southern outfall of the Metropolitan sewer is situate about a mile and a half from this station, on the river bank ; the reservoir and engine-house were constructed in 1863.

Aldershot is the fourth largest. town in Hampshire, and is well built, drained, and lighted. The parish church of St. Michael is an unpretending edifice, dating in parts from the twelfth century ; it contains memorials of the Tichborne family, who were formerly lords of oDe of the manors in the parish.

Fares"], [75, "\u25a02,', of the place is derived from the stream on which it is situated \u2014 the Esshet, a tributary of the river Stour. The town has much increased of late years, owing to the fact of its being the chief depot and locomotive and carriage factory of the South Eastern Railway. The works are situate in what is called the new town (or Alfred, as originally named by the Com- pany as owners), which is a populous hamlet, partly in the parish of Ashford, partly in Willesborough. It is about a mile from Ashford. A large and hand- some building is provided for educating the children of the Company's servants, and a new church to accommodate 600 worshippers was erected in 1867, to a con- siderable extent by the subscriptions of South Eastern shareholders. Between 1,003 and 1,200 persons are employed at the works. (See page xiv.) The parish church, dedicated to St. Mary, is a hand some structure, restored and beautified with much skill aud judgment, and a new and most magnificent stained-glass west window introduced. It illustrates a series of events in the life of ou_ blessed Lord. The church is cross-shaped, in the per- pendicular style, and consists of a nave and two aisles, with transepts, three chancels, and a lofty tower, with four pinnacles, built by Sir John Fogge, lord of Repton, in this parish, in the reign of Edward IV. Sir John was Comptroller of the Household to that monarch, and obtained leave to make the church colle- giate, consisting of a prebendary, with priests and choristers. His tomb, with that of his two wives, is in the high chancel, and bears the date of 1490. Among the ancient monuments in this church is one over 500 years old.

BATTLE.\u2014 (STATION.)\u2014 A mar ket town, parish and urban sanitary dis trict of the county of Sussex (eastern division) ; in Battle union and petty ses sional division, and Hastings county court district. The ancient name of the place was Epiton, but it takes its present one from the celebrated Battle of Senlac (more generally called Hast ings), fought in the year 1066, between William of Normandy and Harold, the last of the Saxon kings. Battle Abbey, now the seat of the Duke of Cleveland, K.G., was founded by William, and dedicated to St. Martin, in commemora tion of the struggle, the high altar occupying the spot where the Saxon royp.l standard was placed. In the Abbey was preserved the celebrated Battle Abbey Roll, which formed a list of those families which came over with William. The great hall is remarkable for its timber roof ; it is 57 feet in length, the same in height, and 31 feet wide. The gate-house, or entrance from the town, directly fronts the street from the London-road : it is a tower, about 35 feet square and 54 feet high, comprising three stories, with an oc tagon turret at each angle, and is thought to have been erected some- \u2022 where about the time of Edward III., when the Abbey was enclosed and for tified ; it is one of the most perfect specimens of monastic gate-houses in the kingdom. The ruins of the Abbey cover three sides of a square. There are nine elegant arches remaining of the Abbey church : tho public are admitted to view the Abbey on Tuesdays. The church of St. Mary was founded by Ralph, Abbot of Battle from 1107 to 1124. The font is a good specimen of the Norman style.

BERKS (County of).\u2014 An in land county, belonging to the south eastern division. Its shape is very irregular. On the north are the coun ties of Oxford and Buckinghamshire, the Thames being the boundary ; on the east Surrey and Middlesex ; on the south Hampshire ; and on the west Wiltshire and Gloucestershire. Length, about 50 miles ; breadth, 2 1 miles, and circumference, 120 miles. Watered by"], [77, "37 the rivers Kennet, Lambourne, Loddon, Oke, Emborn, and the Thames. Berk- shire is well supplied with railway communication. The chief railway is the Great Western, the main line of which enters this county at Maiden- head and proceeds by Twyford to Reading, thence to Pangbourne, Steven- ton, and so near Wantage andFaringdon to Swindon ; it has branch lines open from Didcot by Abingdon to Oxford, from Maidenhead to High Wycombe through Cookham, from Twyford to Henley, from Slough to Windsor, from Reading to Basingstoke on the South Western, and from Reading to Hunger- ford and Devizes, by the Berks and Hants Extension ; the Reading, Guild- ford and Reigate line, connecting the towns from which it is named, crosses the South Western at Guildford, and joins the South Eastern and Brighton lines near Reigate, thus uniting Reading with the whole of the southern system of railways ; the lines from Oxford to the north also place Reading in direct communication with the northern parts of the kingdom. The eocene tract on the south-east border, called Bagshot Heath, has been from time immemorial an unprofitable waste, scarcely producing a single blade of grass. Latterly an extensive portion of this district has been planted with fir, which is proving of considerable value in reclaiming this truly desolate spot. Owing to the great variety of its soils, Berkshire exhibits almost every form of agriculture. Ex- cellent corn crops are raised on the oolitic formation. The south-east and eastern parts of this county are occupied by Windsor Forest and Park. There is much woodland, in which grow hazel, oak, ash, jeech. and alder. At White Horse Hill the Berkshire Downs rise to a height of 893 feet. Berkshire returns three members to Parliament, and con- stitutes an archdeaconry in the diocese -of Oxford and province of Canterbury. It is in the Oxford circuit, and the assizes are held at Reading. The borough representation comprises five members ; namely, Reading, 2 ; Abing- don, 1 ; Wallingford, 1 ; and Windsor, 1. The shire has 20 hundreds, 12 registry districts, and 12 poor-law unions, and contains 192 civil parishes, 6 municipal boroughs [Abingdon, Maidenhead, New- bury, Reading, Wallingford, and New Windsor J, in addition to a part of the city of Oxford ; 8 urban sanitary authorities, 12 rural sanitary authori- ties, and 8 turnpike trusts, lt has also one court of quarter sessions, and is divided into 11 petty sessional divisions, and 7 lieutenancy subdivisions ; the boroughs of Abingdon, Newbury, Read- ing, and New Windsor have separate commissions of the peace and courts of quarter sessions ; the boroughs of Maidenhead and Wallingford have com- missions of tbe peace only. The boroughs of Abingdon, Newbury, Read- ing, and Windsor have their own police. The geology of Berkshire comprises the lower eocene (London clay, &c), which extends across the whole of the southern portion, with the exception of a narrow strip on the south-east border, where tho middle eocene (Barton and Bagshot series) makes its appearance. A ridge of chalk hills, running east and west, divides the vale of the Thames, or of the White Horse, as it is called, from the vale of Kennet. North of these chalk downs a narrow strip of greensand occurs, and beyond this the upper and middle oolite. This county was anciently called Barocscire or Berocscire, softened in process of time into Barkshire and Berkshire, and probably derived its name from a thick wood, called Barroc, which occupied an extended tract be- tween Lambourne and Wantage. The English held this shire as part of the kingdom of Wessex, but it was some- times under the Mid-English. Berk- shire was attacked by the Danes, with whom several battles were fought, a very famous one at Asdown, in which Ethelred and Alfred the Great defeated the invaders. During the middle ages, frequent forays took place in this county, and in the Parliamentary war most of the towns were the scenes of conflict. On the chalk hills near Lam- bourne are some remarkable piles of large stones, one of which is called Wayland Smith's Cave. At Kingston Lisle, near Lambourne, is a curious stone, called a blowing stone. It con- tains an aperture, on blowing into which a sound is \"iven forth which can be heard six miles ofl'. The White Horse, which is the figure of a horse cut ojit of the turf on the side of the chalk"], [78, "38 hills, and left white, is by most thought to have been done by the old English. It moy be seen from a distauce of fifteen miles, and gives name to the hill in which it is cut. At Silchester are re mains of an important Roman station, and old castle ruins exist at Donnington and Wallingford. Iron works, railway engineering works, and a large biscuit factory, have been established at Read ing. There are paper and silk mills on the river Kennet, and a factory for copper goods at Bisham.

Accord- ing to tradition, Julius C\u00e6sar encamped here. In 1001, the Danes had a camp, where they held the Archbishop of Canterbury a prisoner, after sacking his city and cathedral. In the reign of Richard II., Wat Tyler assembled an immense force of Kentish men here. In 1400, Henry IV. received the Emperor of Constantinople at this place. Fifteen years afterwards, Henry V. was received here after the battle of Agincourt. His son, Henry VI., in 1541, came to Black- heath to witness the submission of a number of Jack Cade's followers. The views from this spot are magnifi- cent, the east side terminating in Shooter' s-hill, and the northern bounded by Charlton. The Common is bor- dered by numerous villas, and on it are two episcopal churches and a proprie- tary chapel, and Morden's College for decayed merchants, founded in 1695 by Sir John Morden. It has an annual revenue of more than five thousand pounds. Blackheath is crossed by the Roman Watling-street, and various se- pulchres and other remains of the middle ages have also been discovered. Ascend- ing the hill from Greenwich to the Green Man Tavern on the Heath, there is a remarkable cavern, discovered in 1780. It consists of seven apartments, and is entered by fifty steps, the whole cut out of the chalk rock, with a bottom of sand, and a well of water twenty- seven feet deep. The lodge or ranger's house, near the wall of Greenwich Park, was formerly the residence of the Princess Sophia. That part of the Heath near Lee is called Blackheath Park. Park-road is a line of comfort- able residences. The surface of the district is undulating, and broken with gravel-pits. The town of Blackheath, formerly called Tranquil-vale, has been much increased in size, and is called Park-town. The Population of the district in 1871 was about 5,500. There are more than CO trains each way on week-days; and on Sundays \u2014 except during morning hours of Divine service \u2014 they run hourly in each direction. The Fares from the London terminii are small. tithing of Hawley, and county of Hants (northern division). A large number of residential mansions and parks are in the vicinity. The place takes its name from the Blackwater stream, and is the station for Sandhurst Military College. The College is about a mile from the station, and is situated in beautiful grounds. The building consists of a centre, with Doric portico, two wings, and a very handsome chapel. A well - furnished library contains portraits of George III. and his. Queen, and previous governors.

BOX HILL.\u2014 (STATION.)\u2014 This station takes its name from the magnifi- cently wooded hill which overlooks the town of Dorking, and is thickly clothed with plantations of yew trees, from which \"box wood\" is obtained. From its summit a view of the country for many miles can be secured, and, commanding as it does, some of the most beautiful scenery to be found in the United King dom, it is much frequented in summer by visitors from the metropolis. The river Mole flows underneath the hill, and it is from this circumstance that the stream takes its name. The mansion on the brow of the elevation, opposite the north-west slope of Box Hill, is Denbies, the seat of the Right Hon. Geo. Cubitt, M.P. A short distance from it is Ran more Common, with its graceful church and spire, built by Mr. Cubitt at his sole expense. The gorge, or defile, between Box Hill and Denbies is the only natural opening through the North Downs along an extent of many miles. The station is in the parish of Dorking, and close to Burford Bridge, a favourite halting-place for travellers.

The town is situated on the banks of the small stream known as the Ravensbourne. The Bishop of Rochester, to whom the manor was given by Ethelbert, king of Kent, formerly had a palace here, which was rebuilt court district and petty sessional divi sion, and prettily situated on the shores of the small Bay of Bradston (whence the name is derived). The church was built iu 1831, and is in the Early English style. There are gas and waterworks belonging to companies, and the usual establish ments of a quiet bathing resort. The place is considerably patronised by families. The coast defences here com prise Northfleet and Chandos Batteries.

CANNON STREET.\u2014 (CITY TERMINAL STATION.)-Full par ticulars of this station, with the Bridge, will be found in the Introduction (see page xii.) CANTERBURY. \u2014 (STATION.) \u2014 A parliamentary (returning two mem bers) and municipal borough in the eastern division of the county of Kent ; the metropolitan see of all England, capi tal of the county, a city and county in itself, market town and poor law union of fourteen parishes, in the hundreds of Bridge and Petham, deanery, arch deaconry, and diocese of Canterbury ; it is a principal station on the main line of the London Chatham and Dover Rail way ; 55 miles from London by road, 15 miles from Margate, 15 from Dover, and 7 from Whitstable, which is its port on the river side, and with which it has com munication by means of a branch line of the South Eastern Railway. The quarter sessions for the eastern division of the county are held here. The origin of the city of Canterbury is far beyond the era of authentic British history. Most pro bably it was a seat of superstition, and a principal scene of Druidic barbarity, long before the Christian era. Under the Roman rule it increased its importance from the circumstance of its being on the great high-road to the continent. By them it was called \"Durovernum,\" and at the time of the Heptarchy became the capital of the county, under the name of \" Cant-wara-byrig,\" or \" Kentish men's borough.\" Hengist and Horsa were en tertained here by Vortigern, who after wards took possession of the city ; and Hengist kept his court here, as did his successors of the kingdom of Kent, amongst whom was Ethelbert, the first royal convert of Saxon England to Christianity. The city was burnt and rebuilt several times during the conflicts with the Danes, who, it is believed, threw up the mound called \" The Dane John,\" for military purposes. During the Plan tagenet era the city derived considerable benefit from the concourse of pilgrims to the shrine of Thomas a Becket. Charles I. was married here to Henrietta Marie ; and Charles II. , after his resto ration, held court here for three days. Canterbury gives the title Viscount to the Manners Sutton family, the first Viscount having been created a peer in 1834, after holding the office of Speaker of the House of Commons from 1817 to 1834. Among the eminent men who have flourished here may be noticed \u2014 the Primate Stephen Langton, who first divided the Old and New Testaments into chapters; Osbern, a monk in the eleventh century, who wrote in Latin the life of St. Dunstan, and who, from his skill in music, was called the English Jubal ; John Bale, Prebendary of Canterbury and Bishop of Ossory, the Protestant historian biographer ; Isaac Casaubon, whom, on account of his learning, James I. invited over from France, and Meric, his son, who were both installed prebendaries. Among the eminent men who received the rudiments of their education in the King's Free Grammar School may be noticed \u2014 Dr. Harvey, who discovered the circulation of the blood ; Dr. Marsh, Bishop of Peterborough ; and Lord Tenterden. Among the names of actual natives of the city we may enumerate those of \u2014 Dr. Thomas Ltnacre, founder of the Royal College of Physicians in London ; Dr. Thomas Neville, Master of Magdalene College, and afterwards Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, who was sent by A rch bishop Whitgift to tender the English crown to King James ; Boyle, the great Earl of Cork ; William Somner, author of the \"Antiquities of Canterbury\" and of a Saxon Glossary ; and W. Frend, M.A., author of the \"Ephemeris.\" Can terbury has been the cradle of Saxon and modern English Christianity. Ethel bert's palace was converted into a church and monastery, and an abbey built, dedi-"], [82, "42 pilgrims lodged, some old gabled houses with overhanging stories, and many ruinn of ecclesiastical edifices. The distin guishing feature of Canterbury is the magnificent cathedral commenced by Lanfranc, and added to by subsequent prelates. It is cruciform in shape, 530 feet in length, with a central and two western towers, a beautiful chapter house and some splendid chapels, of which the finest are those of Henry cated to St. Peter and St. Paul, which title Dunstan changed to that of St. Augustine. The abbey became a place of great magnificence, being endowed with 12,000 acres of land. Henry VIII. converted it into a palace for himself. Philip and Mary granted it to Cardinal Pole : and Elizabeth kept court here. Its beautiful gateway still remains. Soon after the conversion of Ethelbert, this city was made a bishopric, and Augustine WEST GATE OF CANTERBURY. the first bishop. Many Roman relics have been discovered in Canterbury. The castle appears to have fallen to decay at a very early date, as no mention is made of it in connection therewith ; but another castle was built, the donjon of which still exists, which is mentioned in Domesday Book. The city abounds with remains of old architecture, amongst which are \u2014 the house of Sir Thomas More, tlie Old Chequers Inn, where the IV., the Lady chapel, and that of the Holy Trinity, in which stood the shrine of a Becket. The crypt has been used since the time of Elizabeth as a French Protestant church. The library con tains some rare MSS., and in the pre cincts are the residential houses of the clergy. The archbishops had, at one time, a palace here, but it became dilapi dated, and has been superseded by Lam beth Palace. Besides the cathedral, D."], [83, "43 there are fourteen parish churches, some of them very ancient, and chapels for several dissenting sects ; other public buildings are \u2014 the guildhall, the court house, the county hall, the house of cor rection, the barracks, the military infir mary, the Kent and Canterbury hospital, the dispensary, the market housQ, the corn and hop exchange, the theatre, the assembly rooms, St. Augustine's college, the philosophical institute and museum, the free library, cfec. Canterbury formerly abounded withmonasteries and nunneries, for monks and nuns of every order, chantries, hospitals, almshouses, and other religious and charitable institu tions, founded by the piety of our fore fathers. Amongst those which have sur vived to the present time are \u2014 the hospital of St. John, founded bj' Lanfranc in 1086, and now supporting a prior and eighteen brethren, who are appointed by the archbishop ; Cogan's hospital for clergymen's widows, founded in 1657 ; King's Bridge hospital, established by Thomas a Becket for educational pur poses and for the maintenance of poor persons; Maynard's and Cotton's hos pitals ; Smith's and Hern's almshouses. &c. ; all of which institutions are under the management of trustees appointed by the Lord Chancellor. There is a free grammar school, founded by Henry VIII., and endowed with twenty-four scholarships. Also blue-coat school for educating sixteen poor boys belonging to the city, the elections to which are made by the council. The revenue of this school is derived from lands, Arc, in the city and in Kent, formerly belonging to the hospital of poor priests ; the surplus funds are appropriated to the reduction of the poor rates. St. Augustine's mis sionary college, founded by Mr. Beres ford Hope, is situated on the site of the old abbey in which the saint was buried, and of which the north gate still remains. Under the Romans, the government of Canterbury was similar to that of other Roman towns ; under the Saxons, the chief magistrate was called the prefect, and afterwards the \" port gerefa,\" or keeper of the walls ; this title was after wards changed into that of king's pro vost, when the king and archbishop held some sort of joint jurisdiction, and although the latter had the power of coining, he was, nevertheless, subordinate to the king. But it would seem that there was a municipal government also, since Edward the Confessor had fifty-one burgesses or freemen, who paid a rent for tbe privilege of trading in the city. At the time of the Conquest, the chief government was in the hands of the \" pr\u00e6positus,\" or prefect, appointed by the king. From Henry II. the city re ceived a charter conferring peculiar pri vileges, in addition to those previously enjoyed. Henry III. granted the city to the inhabitants at fee-farm rent of \u00a360, and empowered the citizens to elect two bailiffs, superseded by a mayor in the reign of Henry VI. (1449), who con ferred tbe privilege of choosing a coroner. Ednard IV. confirmed the preceding charters, remitted more than one-fourth of the fee-farm rent, and constituted the city a county in itself. Henry VI. fixed the number of aldermen at twelve, and of the common - councilmen at twenty - four. Henry VIII., by Act of Parliament, in 1544, empowered the mayor and alder men to levy a fine of 6s. 8d. per day upon all strangers who should keep shops or exercise any trade in the city. James I. confirmed all the former charters and privileges and re-incorporated the citi zens, under the title of the mayor and commonalty of the city of Canterbury. The freedom of the city is inherited by birth, or acquired by servitude, gift, mar riage with a freeman's daughter, or by purchase. Charles II. , in 1676, granted a charter of incorporation to the refugee silk weavers established here. As con stituted under the Municipal Act, the city is divided into three wards, with a mayor, recorder, sheriff, six aldermen, and eighteen councillors ; and it has it3 town commission of the peace, quarter sessions, and police force distinct from the county. The corporation is the urban sanitary authority. Works of main drainage were executed under the superseded pavement commissioners, and sewage works are in operation. The gasworks and waterworks are vested in a private company. The corpora tion lately obtained a General Im provement Act, wliich empowered them, among other things, to establish a burial board and cemetery. In ancient times the city had a reputation for sUk manufactures, but they have given place to a superior kind of damask linen."], [84, "44 Worsted is also made here, and there are several large malting and brewing estab- lishments.

CATERHAM.\u2014 (STATION.)\u2014 A village and parish of Surrey (eastern division) ; in Godstone union and petty sessional division and Reigate county court district. The church of St. Mary, in the Early English style, is a small, plain and very old building. A new church was consecrated in 1866 ; it is in the Early English style, occupies a site opposite the old church, and consists of chancel, north and south aisl es, naves, porch and tower. The Metropolitan District Asylum, for chronic insane persons and imbeciles, is situated in the upper part of the parish, adjoining Chal don and Coulsdon, and is surrounded by a farm of 76 acres. The building is of white brick, with red brick facings, aud consists of 13 blocks and a chapel, with a detached block for infectious cases, six for males and seven for females ; there is a recrea- western end of the Caterham Valley, in the parish of Coulsdon, and county of Surrey (mid division) On the west (or up-line) side of the station the schools of the Warehousemen and Clerks' Provident Society are a prominent feature. On the east side a short distance southwards, a dip in the hills allows the traveller to see the Asylum for Fatherless Children. This institution was founded in 1845 by Dr. Andrew Reed (father of Sir Charles Reed), who was also the projector of the Royal Hospitable for Incurables, and whose estate adjoined that of Reedham, so called in honour of the founder. In this orphan asylum 400 fatherless children are maintained and educated. They are received at any age, and kept until they are fourteen years old. The manage ment cf the asylum is admirable, and the liberal characterof the education, andfree dom from all sectarian influences, render rt a most popular and successful institution.

(See page xii.) CHARLTON.-(JUNOTION STA TION.) \u2014 Old and New Charlton form a parish andsuburban districtof theMetro polis, in the county of Kent (eastern divi sion), Woolwich union and county court district, and the jurisdictions of the Cen tral Criminal Court and Metropolitan Police. The district lies intermediate between Greenwich, Blackheath, and Woolwich, and overlooks the Thames. It is pleasantly situated and contains many picturesque residences. Shooters' Hill, an insulated mass of London clay, about 446 feet in height, is a conspicuous object, covered with dense luxuriant vegetation"], [86, "46 surrounding numerous handsome houses. The parish church, dedicated to St. Luke, is ancient, and contains several tombs, among others a monumental tablet to Sir Adam Newton ; one dedicated to Brigadier- General Richards, who lived in the reign of George I. ; another to Postmaster-General Craggs, implicated in the South Sea Bubble. There is also a monumental bust of Spenser Perceval, who was shot by Bellingham in the lobby of the House of Commons. His remains were interred in the churchyard ; and near him lies another victim of assassination, but on this occasion by the hand of a madman, who had mistaken Mr. Drummond for Sir Robert Peel. In the chancel window may be seen a few armorial bearings in stained glass. Charlton House was one of tbe buildings erected in the reign of James 1., when the old English domestic architec ture was about to be supplanted by what was then thought to be a purer style. The architect is said to have been Inigo Jones. It was begun in 1602, by Sir Adam Newton, and completed about 1612. It is built with red brick, faced here and there with stone quoins and dress ings. In form it is an oblong, with large advanced wings, and a central porch projecting in a somewhat less degree than the w^ngs ; the ground plan being nearly that of a capital E. At each end there is a small square turret. The style is the extremely florid one then in vogue. The chief labour is expended upon the centre, which is elaborately ornamented. The arched doorway has plain double columns on each side ; over it is a niche, in which there is a female bust. The first story has quaintly-carved columns, and above them a series of grotesque sculptured brackets. To this succeeds another story and another row of similar brackets. Along the entire summit is carried a rather singular balustrade. The interior of the mansion is somewhat bizarre, but many of the rooms are very handsome. The richly ornamented roof of the entrance hall, with a deep central pendant hanging from the ceiling, com mands attention. The family arms of the proprietor of Charlton, Sir Thomas Maryon Wilson, supported by a wolf, sur mount the principal baluster at the foot of the stairs. Through two massive oaken doors, ornamented with bright steel hinges, a splendid dining-hall is entered. Communicating with this apartment ia a small chapel, furnished in keeping with other portions of the building. On the first floor, a magnificent room on the right extends the whole depth of the mansion, with large bay windows on either side. In the roof of that which faces the west are seen the arms of James I., and in the opposite recess the device and arms of his eldest son, Henry, Prince of Wales, who spent here a con siderable portion of bis short life under the care of Sir Adam Newton, his tutor. This room is richly decorated and fur nished. Amongst other objects of rare beauty is a variegated marble fireplace, supported by statues of white marble. To one apartment a well-known legend is attached ; a very remarkable fireplace of highly polished black marble stood here, in which, it is asserted, Lord Downes,\\vho was seated opposite to it, saw the reflec tion of several figures passing across the distant heath, whose attitudes led him to imagine that they were engaged in the perpetration of some robbery. He in stantly despatched his servants to the spot, and the same dubious tradition declares tbat the thieves were captured and punished. In the next room is a full-length portrait of Prince Henry ; and throughout the mansion is a small but choice collection of paintings, with numerous specimens of art, such as antique cabinets, vases, (fee. The magni ficent saloon, extending the whole length of the south front, is full of precious ob j ects. The park and pleasure grounds, whence a fine view is obtained of the ancient mansion, are of great extent and beauty. In the former are some of the largest and finest trees that this county can boast of. Area : 1,231 acres. Popu lation : 7,699. The Train Service, on week days and Sundays, is very frequent, and the Fares from the London terminii small. C HART HAM\u2014 (STATION.)\u2014 A parish and village of the county of Kent ; in Bridge union and Canterbury county court district and petty sessional division. The parish is known as Chart ham-with-Horton and lies in a fertile vale on the river Stour, three miles north-west of Canterbury. It is built round a green with the parsonage and church ou the south side of it. On the"], [87, "47 Stour, which is crossed near the village by an ancient bridge of five arches, is a paper-mill. The church, dedicated to St. Mary, is of early decorated architec ture, with very fine windows, and some remains of richly-stained glass; the roof is of wood, and the embattled tower of flint, both being of later date than the stone work ; in the chancel lie the remains of Dr. John Reading, chaplain to Charles I. and author of some religious tracts. There is also among other in teresting mortuary memorials, a large slab, inlaid with brass, of a knight, large as life, cross-legged, in mail armour, with a surcoat above, a shield on his left arm, a lion at his heels, and a long sword hanging pendant from a very rich girdle. It perpetuates the memory of Sir Robert Septrand, who was with Richard I. at the siege of Acre. There is also a monument to the French refugee, Dr. Delangle, dated 1724 ; and iu the south transept may be observed a beautiful monument by Rysbrach to Sir William Young and his wife. Mystole House and Park is the family estate of the Fagges, from the time of Charles II. The present mansion was built in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, It is a moderate-sized house, pleasantly situated in a small park. Not far distant from this place, in 1868, some workmen, while digging a well, turned up, at the depth of 19 feet, a parcel of strange and monstrous bones, some whole, some broken, together with four teeth of an unusual size, perfect and sound, but turned into stone, each tooth weighing about half a pound. There are numerous other handsome mansions in the neigh bourhood of Chartham, some of which are visible from the railway. The popu lation is largely composed of the work men employed at Mr. W. Howard's paper mills, and their families. The East Kent Lunatic Asylum \u2014 erected in 1875 at a cost of \u00a3200,000 \u2014 is at Chartham Downs, which have at various times yielded Anglo - Saxon relics. Area : 5,530 acres.

CHATHAM. \u2014 (Station\u2014 STROOD\u2014 2 miles; but connected by a short branch with the Chatham station of the London Chatham and Dover Railway.) \u2014 A parliamentary (returning one member) borough, urban sanitary district, town and parish in the county of Kent (mid division) ; in Medway union, and Rochester county court district. Chatham forms a special police dis trict, and, in conjunction with Sheer ness, engages a stipendiary magistrate. The town is on the south bank of the Medway, and adjoins both Roches ter and Strood. Its royal dockyard and repository for naval stores and ordnance are protected by a system of fortifications \u2014 the \"Chatham lines\" \u2014 unequalled in the world ; in fact, both shores of the river, from the Nore to the harbour, and the land approaches in every direction, display a seemingly interminable series of batteries and forts. Chatham seems to have been a place of little importance prior to the establish ment of the dockyard. The town was originally built by Charles II., after the Dutch war. It consists chiefly of one long, bustling 3treet, with smaller ones branching out of it eastward, in continuation of Rochester, on the road to Canterbury. The naval station was formed in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Chatham old church, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, was almost entirely rebuilt in 1788. The shrine of Our Lady at Chatham used to be famous for working miracles. In the church is the tomb of Stephen Borough, who discovered the passage to Archangel. St. John's was erected in 1821, by the Parliamentary Commissioners, at a cost of fifteen thou sand pounds. St. Bartholomew's Chapel stands on the site of an ancient hospital for lepers. Behind the \" Sun Inn,\" is a pier erected by Colonel Best at a cost of three thousand pounds. On account of the fortifications in the neighbourhood, a military school was founded here in 1812. In the course of the practice in each year, siege operations are sometimes carried on upon a large scale, and attract many strangers. A large invalid esta blishment is kept up at Chatham. Mel ville Hospital contains 134 patients. The hospital for decayed mariners was founded by Sir John Hawkins in 1592, and provides for twelve pensioners.

The Lepers' Hospital, founded in 1108, and under the patronage of the dean, is now an almshouse, with four inmates, two of whom are officiating Prison accommodates 1,000 inmates. The arsenal and barracks extend more than two miles along the Medway. The former contains storehouses and a large"], [89, "49 park of artillery. The Marine Hospital has accommodation for 340 patients. The Artillery Barrack is a great station for artillery. It was erected in 1804, and forms three sides of a square, and has accommodation for a large number of invalids. The Artillery Hospital is attached to the barrack. The Infantry Barracks are very large. There are also Engineering Barracks. The Jubilee Memorial in Chatham was erected in 1859. The hospital dedicated to St. Bartholomew contains one hundred beds. In 1861 was completed the Royal Engineers' Memorial, the first stone hav- ing been laid by the Duke of Cambridge on March 1st, 1860. The names of every officer and every sapper alike who fell in the Crimea are inscribed in white marble slabs let into the stonework of the arch, so that the memorial is truly, as its inscription implies, a memorial by \" The Corps of Royal Engineers to their Comrades who fell in the war with Russia, 1854, 1855 and 1856.\" The Dockyard at Chatham was founded in Queen Elizabeth's time on a small scale. This establishment was where the Ordnance Wharf or Old Dock now stands. In 1667, the Dutch Admiral, Van Ghent, burnt several ships here ; and from that time it was strongly fortified and extended, and is now one of the four grand naval stations of the empire, ranking with Portsmouth, Plymouth, and Woolwich. Sheerness is connected with it. The Dockyard is nearly a mile in length, extending down the river. The public are admitted under certain regulations daily, except Sundays. The yard contains wet docks, magazines, storehouses, a church, and residences for the naval officers. A large establishment of arti- zans and labourers is kept up here.

Cheriton is in the parliamentary borough of Hythe, midway between that place and Folkestone, and about one mile north of Sandgate. The camp at Shorncliffe and part of the Seabrook estate is within the Cheriton boundary. The situation of the village, <fec, is very pleasant and agreeable. In olden times it was called Cherington, and tbe manor was formerly the property of the noble family of Aver- anche3. St. Martin's church is an ancient edifice, a portion of the tower show- ing unmistakable Saxon workmanship ; there is a chapel on the north side, and a handsome arcaded chancel. The build- ing once contained fine monuments of crusaders, and there are still three recum- bent figures dating from the fourteenth century. Several brasses, including one of the year 1474, commemorate the Brockman family. The main fabric of the church was restored in 187 3, and the tower in 1877. Underbill House, in this parish, is noted as being the Duke of Richmond's place of concealment in the earlier part of the Commonwealth. Writter, who befriended the duke, was rewarded by Charles II. with the gover- norship of Upnor Castle. Area: 1,617 acres. Population (exclusive of the camp) : 3,403.

The church of St. Mary is an old and handsome building, and was re stored in 1863. One mile from Chilham, at Sheldwich, is Leos Court, the seat of Earl Sondes. This splendid mansion was erected by Sir George Sondes, K.B., Ump. Charles I., from a design"], [91, "51 by Inigo Jones, upon the site of the old mansion at Lees Court. The front is adorned with fourteen Grecian-Ionic pilasters, which divide the windows. Above the ground floor, the building is raised one story, and covered with a cottage roof, supported by brackets ; it is altogether a very stately edifice, sur rounded by beautiful grounds. A little more than a mile north of Selling, on the road to Faversham, is Nash Court, the demesne of the Hawkins family since the reign of Edward III. The mansion is of imposing appearance, situated on an eminence in the midst of _ spacious, well-planted park, and com manding extensive views over the sur rounding country. Area : 4,343 acres.

CLIFFE. \u2014(Station\u2014 HIGHAM\u2014 3 miles.) \u2014 A small village and parish of the county of Kent (mid division), notable for its bold promontory, stretch ing forth beyond the Mdton Marshes, and overlooking the Thames. The vil lage and church occupy the summit, and the winding of the river at this point is very interesting. This commanding height was in former times rendered available for \" watch and ward \" to the river. In the reign of Richard II. beacons were erected here, and there is now a large fort, which forms one of the river defences. Area: 7,756 acres. Population: 1,290. COBHAM.\u2014 (Station\u2014 HIGHAM \u2014 4 miles.) \u2014 A village and parish of the county of Kent (mid division) ; in North Aylesford union and petty sessional division, and Gravesend county court district. The village of Cobham is a quiet unpretending place. The church, dedicated to St. Mary Magdalen, at the entrance to the village, discloses by a survey of the architectural features of its exterior the great ageof themainportions of the fabric ; and this is corroborated by the inscription among the most ancient of the brass effigies to be seen within, bear ing date 1354, being upwards of five centuries old ; the church itself may claim one hundred years in advance of this. The general appearance of the interior, like that of most village churches, presents a curious sample of modern whitewash renovation, contrasted with the remains of an ancient decora tive character. The rich oak screens and carved stalls, crumbling now into the very dust of age, accord but doubt fully with the coloured roof and painted pews. The magnificent series of brasses, thirteen in number, memorials of the Cobhams and Brookes, are the first"], [92, "52 objects to be observed ; for these, above i all else, have made this little church celebrated far and wide. Theso brass effigies, all, with two exceptions, of the size of life, are mostly in a good state of preservation. Commencing at thesouth \"east corner, the first of the lower raDge is that of Sir John de Cobham, known as \"the young Constable,\" from having held, early in life, the government of the neighbouring castle of Rochester. The next effigy is Margerie, said to be wife to Reynold de Cobham, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in the reign of Edward III. The third figure is Maud, wife of Sir Henry de Cobham, son of the pre- ceding. Beside Maud is placed the effigy of Sir Reginald Braybrooke, her second husband ; ou her right is Sir Nicholas Hawberke, her third spouse : these two latter brasses are, perhaps, tbe most elegantly engraved of the whole series. The two exterior monuments of the upper row, the figures in which are less than lifo-size, are those to John and Thomas Brooke, Barons of Cobham, their wives and families. Against the chancel walls are hung some rust-eaten pieces of armour, apparently remain*! of tilt-armour of the reign of Henry V. A helmet, surmounted with a represen tation of a human head, belonged, according to village tradition, to one of the Lords of Cobham, who settled CLIFfE CHURCH AND PROMONTORY. a pending dispute with some neighbour ing noble in a trial by battle. His lady is at his side, and several children are around them in a kneeling position. The ancient College was founded by John, Lord Cobham, whose monument we have mentioned. Lambarde, the Kentish perambulator, was one of its first trus tees. The quaint old dining-hall is now a chapel, for the use of the pensioners who reside here. The building was founded for the support of five priests. At the dissolution it was resounded, and the funds were employed in providing a residence for twenty poor persons, with a quarter of an acre of land to each , and a small monthly stipend. It is an easy figure of Margaret, wife of John, Lord Cobham, whose memorial succeeds next. This nobleman built abridge at Roches ter, converted the family mansion at Cowling into a fortified castle, and founded tlie original College adjoining the churchyard. He was one of the council of Regency duriug the youth of Richard II. Thomas, whose memorial ranges next, was uncle of the pre ceding. Joan, daughter of Lord Cob ham, succeeds. She died during the lifetime of her father, leaving her daughter, Joan, who had five successive husbands, the fourth among them being the venerable martyr, Sir John Old castle. Placed on her left hand is the"], [93, "53 walk hence to the Hall, which is seen, reposing beneath the shelter of a thickly and well-planted range of stately trees. In a brick gateway near the stabling a curious carved carriage is shown, said to be the vehicle in which Mary, Queen of Scots, rode after her marriage with the Earl of Darnley. Another account con nects it with the time of Charles II. A door on the left hand of a Tudor archway discloses the exterior of this stately old English mansion, which is entirely domestic in character ; the main building \u2014 of brick \u2014 cousisting of two extensive wings with lofty octagonal turrets in the middle and at the ex tremities. These wings are inscribed with their respective dates of erection, being 1582 and 1594. They are united by a central building, designed by Inigo Jones ; the ground plan of the edifice being thus in the form of a capital H. As a whole, it is both striking and picturesque. The rooms which are shown at Cobham have little of the air of antiquity. In the early part of the present century the whole house under went chauges deteriorating to its original character, but, doubtless, more adapted to modern convenience. Many of the rooms are very elegant, and they are furnished with considerable splendour. The dining room is chastely decorated, by which the effect of the pictures is con siderably enhanced. The next, the music-room, is the most magnificent in the house, and is said to have been pro nounced by George IV. \" the finest room in England.\" This is one of the apartments erected by Inigo Jones. It is large, lofty, and well-proportioned ; the walls are, to somo height, of polished white marble, with pilasters of Sienna marble. The floor is of polished oak ; one end of the room is a music gallery, containing an organ. In the music-hall there is a very tine full-length picture, by Vandyke, of the two sons of the Earl of Lennox, who were killed while fighting for Charles I. against the Parliament. In the dining-room are several other portraits by Vandyke. There are also in this room portraits by Lely and Kneller. On the staircase are several large paintings, but the chief and most valuable are collected in tbe Picture Gallery. Here is Rubens' grand picture, \" The Head of Cyrus brought to Queen Tomyris.\" This picture was purchased from the Orleans collection. There is also another good painting by Rubens, \"The Boar Hunt,\" very ani mated and vigorous. The Guidos, of which there are several, are generally considered among the choicest pictures in the gallery. There are also two or three paintings by Titian, also two historical subjects by Salvator Rosa, much admired. In this gallery is a large antique bath of the finest red oriental granite, which the Italians call coralliuo. The most valuable paintings belong to the Venetian and the Neerlandish schools ; but there are many interesting specimens of the Neapolitan and Bolognese, French, and English schools ; nor are the Spanish and German quite unrepresented. The chief part of the collection was formed by the purchase of a number of pictures from the Orleans Gallery, and also by that of the Vetturi Gallery from Venice. The park, which is well stocked with deer, extends over an area of nearly two thousand acres, and is seven miles in circumference. It is well diversified with hill and valley, and broad smooth glades and bosky dells. Some parts of it afford the most beauti ful woody scenery tbat can be desired ; others present wide and noble prospects. The park contains some very large trees, the chestnuts being especially famous. One is known as the \" Four Sisters,\" from the four large arms into which its stem, thirty-two feet in circumference, divides itself. Area : 3,056 acres. Population : 998. CRAYFORD. \u2014 (STATION.)-A parish and village of the county of Kent (western division) ; in Dartford Union, couDty court district, and petty ses sional division. Crayford is a very ancient place and derives its name from its situ ation on the river Cray, upon which stream, contiguous to the village, are several silk and calico printing establish ments. In the year 457 Hengist defeated the Britons under Vortigern at this place. In Domesday Book the village is men tioned as having a church and three mills. There are several caves in the parish which are supposed to have been formed by the Cyrari as places of security for their families during their wars. The church, dedicated to St. Paulinus, stands on an eminence at the upper end of the"], [94, "54 town. It contains several interesting monuments, and many more were de stroyed by a fire which burnt down a part of the fabric. Hops are largely grown in this district. Area: 2,433 acres. Population : 3,887. Average Train Ser vice : Fourteen each way on week days ; eight each way on Sundays. Fares from London: 2/9 /, 2/3 s, 1/3 t. Return Tickets (4 days), 4/6/, 3/4 s, 2/4 /. CROYDON. \u2014 (Two Stations \u2014 EAST CROYDON and ADDISCOMBE ROAD.) \u2014 A large market town, parish, and urban sanitary district of the county of Surrey (eastern division) ; in Croydon union, county court district, and petty sessional division, and the Metro politan Police district. The East Croy don Railway Station is jointly used by the South Eastern and London Brighton and South Coast Railway Companies. Addiscombe Road is the terminal station of the branch from Lewisham. Croydon, although a place of great antiquity, is seldom mentioned in history. It is situ ated on the Roman road of Ermine street. The town is about amile in length. The part now called High-street was formerly only a bridle -road through fields. The old, or lower town, called Old Croydon, was situated further from London, towards Beddington. Croydon is the capital of East Surrey, and assizes are held here alternately with Guildford. Churches, t&c. : St. John the Baptist, parish church ; St. James's, St. Peter's, Christ Church, St. Andrew's, and St. Mary's. Nonconformist Chapels : Inde pendent chapel, Friends' meeting-house, Wesleyan chapel, Baptist chapel, and Roman Catholic chapel. There are School Board and National schools in Croydon, also Freemasons' almshouses, public hall, town hall and gaol, market house, lecture hall, gas company, banks, and a literar}' and scientific institution. Tho church, dedicated to St. John the Baptist, and considered one of the finest examples of ecclesiastical architecture in the coun ty, is supposed to have been commenced by Archbishop Courtney, who became primate in 1381, and died in 1396 ; but it does not appear to have been completed until tbe days of Archbishop Chicheley. It is situated at the bottom of the town, near the source of the Wandle, and is built of stone and flint, in the Pointed style. It consists of a nave, three aisles, and two chancels. At the west end is a handsome square tower, rising to the height of four stories, and supported by strong buttresses, and adorned at the summit by battlements and crocketed pinnacles issuing from octagonal turrets. It contains a good ring of eight bells, cast in 1738, with chimes which play a psalm tune every sixth hour. An old marble font, at the west end of the south aisle, is said to be of the time of Arch- bishop Chicheley ; it is octagonal, with quatrefoil panels on its sides, ornamented with roses and grotesque heads. In the middle chancel are some ancient wooden stalls. There is an unusually rich col- lection of monumental brasses and in- scriptions in this church, and even on the exterior ; and in the churchyard are many interesting memorials of the dead. In the middle chancel, on a sarcophagus within an arched recess, lies the painted effigy of Archbishop Grindall, in his scarlet robes. This venerable prelate died in 1583, aged eighty-three years. In the south-east corner of St. Nicholas's chantry is a splendid monument to the memory of Archbishop SheldoD, who died iu 1677, representing the recumbent effigies of this dignitary in his archiepis- copal robes and mitre. The figure is of statuary marble, beautifully sculptured. On the northside of the altar, within sepa- rate recessed arches, are the sculptured effigies of a man and woman kneeling before desks. This monument dates from the sixteenth century, and commemo- rates a worthy citizen and grocer of \"Lon- don famous cittie,\" Maister Henry Mill. In St. Nicholas's chantry are also the tombs of the Archbishops Wake, Potter, and Herring, who succeeded each other, and died, respectively, in the years 1736, 1747, and 1757. On the cast wall of St. Mary's chancel is a beautiful monument of white marble to the memory of Mrs. Bowling, aud representing an angel bearing up a female. The sculpture is by Flaxman. On the north wall of the same chancel is a large white tomb for the Heron family and of the sixteenth century. It is ascended by three steps, and bears the figures of a man in armour, in alto-relievo, attended by his five sons, and a woman, attended by eight daugh- ters. Here, rlso, is Archbishop Whit- gift's monument, a sarcophagus, sup- ported by Corinthian columns of black"], [95, "55 marble. It represents the recumbent effigies of the prelate in sable robes, with his hands raised in the act of prayer. He died in 1604. It appears by the parish registers (which are complete from tbe year 1538) that Alexander Barkley, or Barclay, author of \" The Ship of Fools,\" was buried in Crojdon churchyard in 1552. On the restoration of the church, in 1844, some ancient paintings were discovered, some of large size, and one of them representing St. Christopher. Besides the churches named, there are in the suburbs several chapels-of-ease and chapelsand meeting-housesfor several de nominations of dissenters. The Church of St. Peter at Southend will accommodate one thousand persons. Whitgift's Hos pital,thenoblest benefaction thatCroydon nas ever enjoyed, was founded by Arch hishop Whitgift, in the reign of Elizabeth, for the maintenance of a warden, school master, and twenty-eight men and women, or as many more under forty as the revenues would admit. The building is an unpretending brick edifice, of the Elizabethan style of architecture, and of a quadrangular form. It has under gone a renovation, both internally and externally. Over the entrance are armorial bearings of the See of Canter bury, surmounting this inscription : \" Qui dat pauperi, non indigebit.\" The chapel of the hospital, a small apartment forming the south-east angle of the building, was consecrated in 1599, by the name of \" The Chapel of the Holy Tri nity.\" In this chapel are some inte resting remains ; amongst them is a por trait of Archbishop Whitgift, painted on a board, with an inscription in Latin above, which may be thus rendered : \" My all I did ; the all allowed by heaven : Envy, do more ; if more to thee be given.\" Below:\u2014 rspo very pleasing and substantial appear ance, and the main street is long and spacious. Some of the houses are hand some. The parish includes eight hamlets within its limits, and a con siderable part of Norwood, which was formerly a forest. Tho neighbourhood of Croydon (particularly the west part of it, called Duppa's Hill, adjoining to and open from the range of hills called Banstead and Epsom Downs) is much frequented by invalids from the metro polis on account of the purity of the air. Croydon is supposed to have been the ancient Novromagus. At the Conquest it was bestowed on Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, whose successors in the See have been lords of the manor ever since ; and here was an archiepiscopal palace, where the primates usually resided from 1278 to 1757. In this palace James I. of Scotland was imprisoned. In 1573 Archbishop Parker entertained Queen Elizabeth and all her retinue here for seven days ; an expensive manifes tation of loyalty in those times. Having fallen into decay, the palace was sold in 1780, under the authority of an Act of Parliament, for \u00a32,520. The palace was then turned into an establishment for printing linens, and the garden was made a bleaching-ground ; but the demesne having been subsequently resold in lots, the buildings were converted into sepa rate dwellings. Of this ancient archi episcopal palace, only a few fragments remain : an arch is especially worth notice. The extensive drainage opera tions at Croydon have contributed much to the healthiness and prosperity of the town. Market Day ; Thursday (cattle and corn).

DARTFORD.\u2014 (STATION.) \u2014A town, parish, and urban sanitary district of tbe county of Kent (western division) ; in Dartford union, county court district, and petty sessional division. A fine view of the town is obtained on the right just before entering the station from the di rection of London ; on the left beneath is a pretty lake-like pond, studded with little islands. The latter adjoin the ground of the Ph\u0153nix paper mill, a most conspicuous object from the line. The town is seated on a narrow valley on the river Dart or Darent, from which its name is derived. It has been a place of consideration from the time of the Ro- very nearly joins on to Crayford and Wil mington. The church, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, is a venerable and spacious Gothic structure, with an embattled tower at the north-west sides. It contains several ancient monuments, among which is one in commemoration of Sir John Spielman, who introduced the process of paper-making to Dartford. In the pavement near tbis monument is a slate inlaid with brasses, of Richard Martyn and his wife, under a rich canopy. There are several other inlaid slabs in different parts of the church, and some of them are very curious. In the old churchyard was anciently a chapel to St. Edmund the Martyr, on the site of which a very handsome and costly monument has been erected, by subscription, to the memory of Christopher Ward, who was burnt at the stake on Dartford Brent, July 7th, 1 555. The old burial-ground is on the hill adjoining. Here is interred the great engineer, Richard Trevithick, the inventor of the railway locomotive, the high-pressure engine, the steam ballast engine, <fec. There are also places of worship for several denominations of Christians ; also charities, almshouses, &c. ; endowed grammar school, board schools, literary institution, &c. Near the town are the ruins of a nunnery, founded in 1355, by Edward III., after the victory of Crecy and surrender of Calais, for Augustine nuns, but after wards occupied by Dominican nuns. At the Dissolution the prioress and several of the nuns were of some of the best and most ancient families in the country. The buildings were occupied by Henry VIII., and, during her progress in Kent, by Queen Elizabeth, as a royal residence. The present remains are of brick, and consist of a large embattled gateway, with some adjacent buildings, now occupied as a farmhouse. The gardens and orchards occupied twelve acres aud were surrounded by a stone wall. The corn and cattle market for Dartford is contiguous to the Bull yard. The building accommodates about 300 oxen and 1,500 sheep. During tbe Celtic period there was a great town on the heights between the rivers Darent and Cray : great remains are still existent in the woods ; mention is made of them by Hasted, and the destruction of the town is attributed to the Wars of the Roses ; mans, occupying an important station at the crossing of the river by the Great Watling Street from London to Dover. Domesday Book refers to it as having a church and three chapels. Isabella, sister of Henry III., was married here in 1235 to the Emperor Frederick III. Edward III. held a tournament at Dartford on his return from France in 1331. The great insurrection under Wat Tyler, in the reign of Richard IL, broke out here, in consequence of an insult offered to his daughter by a tax-gatherer, on the occasion of collecting a poll-tax, an obnoxious levy on the inhabitants. The incidents in this struggle are well known, and the results were that an immense force was coll ected with which Tyler marched to Blackheath. The first mill established in England for rolling and slitting iron was erected at Dartford in 1590, by Godfrey Box, a native of Brabant. Dartford Creek exports the manufactured and agricul tural produce ; also chalk, lime, and whiting ; and imports coal and timber for the neighbouring district. The town"], [97, "57 but the decay (says Dunkin) was owing to the construction on the Watling-street of the Roman station Novromagus, \u2014 i. e., the New Town, \u2014 now Dartford, at the ford at the foot of the hill. The great Brit ish town was the city of Cassivelaunus, which C\u00e6sarmarched to, and then received that check which forced him to retreat to the coast at Lymne, and there embark, in two ships, the wasted remnant of that mighty force which had been brought from Gaul in nearly a thousand vessels. The Priory Farm was formerly a priory, afterwards King Henry VIII.'s palace. There is some beautiful brick-wrork here, especially an arch : the garden wall is also in fair preservation. On the right of the town is the Royal Flour Mill, also silk-printing works, and the gun powder mills of Messrs. Pigou and Wilks. There are also many other flour and paper mills on the banks of the river Darent. On the Brent is the City of London Lunatic Asylum, a beautiful building, with a frontage of about 900 feet. About two and a half miles from the station is the ancient hospital of St. John's, now a farm. HortonCourt Lodge, five miles from Dartford, formerly was a castle. The ruins are still there. Frank s, four miles, is very ancient, and has undergone re storation. Eynsford Castle, now in ruins, is six miles from Dartford. Lullingstone Castle is seven miles from the town : here is a very fine archway. The ruins of Otford Castle, eleven miles from the station, are worth a visit. The scenery in the neighbourhood of Dartford is highly interesting. There are numerous handsome residences. About one mile and a half south from the railway station is Wilmington, the manor-house of which, beautifully situated, was, in the reign of Edward IV., the residence of the king-making Earl of Warwick. The village is exceedingly picturesque, and is surrounded by gardens and cherry orchards. South-east of Dartford, about three miles distant, is Darenth, a village deriving its name from the river Darent, on the banks of which it is situated. The church is small and ancient, some portions being supposed to date from the Anglo-Saxon period. The font is inter esting, beiDg of large size, so as to admit of the complete immersion of infants. There are also some monuments. The traveller on the railway between Dart- ford and Greenhithe will be struck with the picturesque appearance of the old sand-pits which are traversed by this line. They contain an area of many acres, the cuttings being of great depth, and it must have been the work of ages to have fashioned them to their present form. Trees grow on their summit to the very edges of the cliffs ; and here and there summer-houses may be seen amidst them, which have all the appearance of a perilous position, while the bottoms of the pits are laid out and cultivated with vegetables. Through the openings that occasionally intervene, and in emerging from some of the short tunnels, the most lovely prospects present themselves.

By the ancient Britons it was called \" Dole,\" signifying a low open plain upon the sea ; and many adhere to the belief, based upon the authority of Henricus, that it is the place where C\u00e6sar landed. It was annexed to tbe Cinque Ports soon after the Conquest, Henry VIII. erected three castles in its vicinity \u2014 those of Deal, Walmer and Sandown \u2014 for the defence of the coast ; and besides these, there are two batteries ; making five"], [98, "58 libraries, bazaars, <fcc. There are also national and infant schools, custom house, dispensary, infirmary, and old and new assembly rooms. There ia little or no trade, the population being chiefly employed as boatmen, pilots, and fishermen. Boat building exists on a small scale, and passing ships are supplied with stores. The intrepidity of the Deal boatmen in putting to sea in the roughest weather, for the purpose of saving lives and relieving distressed vessels, is familiar to all.

DEPTFORD. \u2014 (STATION.)\u2014 A suburb of the Metropolis in the county of Kent (western division) ; it is in Green wich union, county court district, and parliamentary borough. Deptsord is within the jurisdiction of the Metro politan Police, Board of Works (iu parts), und the Central Criminal Court. The principal feature ofthe place is the Dockyard, first established by Henry VIII. Here, in 1581, Queen Elizabeth visited Drake's ship, the \" Golden Hind;\" and after dining on board, tho honour of knighthood was conferred upon the famous mariner. The Dockyard build ings and premises altogether comprise an area of thirty-one acres. The town is irregularly built. The chief buildings are the parish church of St. Paul, a well- endowed charity school, two ancient hospitals for decayed pilots and ship- masters, or their widows, one of which comprises fifty-six houses within the walls, belonging to the Trinity House. The wharves, storehouses, and privato yards for ship-building, mostly employ the inhabitants. The old bridge was taken down in 1859, and replaced by a substantial cast-iron one. A Baptist fortresses within four miles. Walmer Castle is the official residence of the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, and in it the Duke of Wellington died in 1852. Deal Castle has been converted into a family residence, the moat having been planted with trees, and changed into a promenade ; aud Sandown, where Colonel Hutchinson was imprisoned and died in 1664, is now in ruins. For parliamentary purposes Walmer was united to Deal by the Reform Act, which places, in conjunction with Sand wich, return two members to the House of Commons. Deal was made a free borough, by charter,in 1699, by William HI., with a mayor, twelve jurats, and a council of twenty-four ; the jurats acting as magistrates, separate from the county justices. The corporation now consists of a mayor, six aldermen, and eighteen councillors, and the borough has a com mission of the peace, with quarter sessions and its own police force. The corporation is the urban sanitary authority. Water and gas works are in the hands of joint stock companies. There is a cemetery of five acres in extent, under the control of the parochial burial board ; interments also take place at the parish church in Upper Deal, and at St. George's in Lower Deal. The borough consists of Upper and Lower Deal, Walmer, Sholden, and Great and Little Mongeham. The parish church of St. Mary is small but ancient, in the Norman style, with zigzag mould ings, and is surrounded by a fosse. A chapel of ease, dedicated to the Saviour, was built in 1848. Other churches are \u2014 St. George's, St. Andrew's (recently altered and repaired), St. Leonard's, and St. Martin's at Great Mongeham. The Catholics, Wesleyan Methodists, Inde- pendents, Primitive Methodists, and Unitarians also have chapels in the town. In 1864 a handsome iron pier was erected, which forms a good promenade in summer for visitors. At Walmer there is a large naval and military hospital, and barracks for soldiers. On the shore is an electric time-ball for the use of ships in the Downs. The air being good, and the sea beach favourable for bathing Deal has of late years been resorted to as a watering-place, and several smart-looking villas and rows of houses have been erected for the accom- modation of visitors, besides baths,"], [99, "59 chapel and schools were recently erected at the junction of the old and new roads, near the toll-gate. By the muni ficent gift of \u00a310,000 by the Baroness Burdett-Coutts, a church was erected in 1855, on the Lewisham Road in tbis parish, with parsonage house, grounds, and schools for 200 boys, 170 girls, and 200 infants. The workhouse at Deptsord occupies the site of Saye's Court, the residence of Evelyn, the author of the celebrated \" Diary,\" \"Sylva,\" and numerous other works. This talented and amiable man was wide and handsome principal street, with two others branching out at its southern end ; the whole town being very clean, well paved, and lighted with gas. St. Martin's church is a handsome structure of the decorated style, partly rebuilt in 1837, aud almost wholly so in 1873-6 at a cost of \u00a326,000 ; it contains the mauso leum of the Dukes of Norfolk, lords of the manor. In the churchyard is buried, Hoole, the well-known translator of Tasso and Ariosto. There are also district churches at Holmwood Common and Westcott, near Berry Hill.

The large cellars or caves beneath the town, dug out of the solid rock, are highly curious. It is said that, more than one hundred years since, a man was foolish enough to ex pend all his property in making the largest of these excavations, at the bot tom of which there is now a spring of pure water. [The environs are adorned with some handsome country seats ; among which we may notice Shrub Hill ; the Rookery, the birthplace of Malthu3 ; Deepdene, a fine Italian villa, surrounded by beautiful grounds, which its owner, H. T. Hope, Esq., M.P., greatly extended by throwing into them the estates of Betchworth and Chart parks. Near the Deepdene, on a sloping piece of ground, stands tho Church of St. Paul, consecrated in July, 1857 ; it is built of Bath stone and flint, in the early decorated or geometrical style. The east and west windows are fitted with painted glass. The walls of the interior are ornamented with ecclesiastical devices, in stamped stucco. The church and parsonage ad joining \u2014 \u25a0 handsome buildings \u2014 were erected at the sole expense of John Labouchere, Esq., of Broome Hall, who also liberally endowed the church. The site was given by Henry Thomas Hope, Esq. In the neighbourhood, also, is Denbies (referred to under the heading of Box Hill Station), on an elevation about two miles north-west ; the mansion was built, in 1734, by Jonathan Tyers, the originator of Vauxhall : this estate now belongs to the Right Hon. George Cubitt, M.P., son of the late Thomas Cubitt, Esq., the celebrated engineer. The beautiful church on Ranmore Com mon is dedicated to St. Barnabas : The spire is 156 feet high. The whole cost was defrayed by Mr. George Cubitt. About three miles south is Wootton, long the abode of John Evelyn, author of the \"Sylva;\" and about a mile beyond is Leith Hill, 993 feet high, the most elevated spot in Surrey, commanding a view of London northward, and of the British Channel to the south. Westcott, or Westgate- street, is a hamlet in the parish of Dorking, lying one mile and a half west of the town on the Guildford- road, and, together with the hamlet of Milton, has been assigned as a new eccle siastical district.

DOVER. \u2014 (Stations \u2014 TOWN AND HARBOUR, and the ADMIR ALTY PIER.) \u2014 A parliamentary and municipal borough of the county of Kent (eastern division), market town, and poor-law union of twenty-three parishes, seaport and steam-packet station, one of the Cinque Ports, in the hundred of Bewsborough, lathe of St. Augustine, deanery of Dover, and archdeaconry and diocese of Canterbury ; a terminal station of the South Eastern and the London Chatham and Dover Railways ; 76 miles from London by the former, and 78 by the latter line ; 16 mdes from Canterbury. On account of its position as the nearest landing place from the Continent, Dover bas from the earliest period been a place of some importance. It was the place which Julius C\u00e6sar intended to land his forces when he invaded England, but the heights ap peared to him so formidably defended by the Britons, that he was obliged to go further north. It was called \" Dwyr \" (from \" Dwyffyrrha,\" a steep place) by the ancient Britons, \" Dubris \" by the Romans, \" Dofre \" or \" Dovre \" by the Saxons, and in Domesday Book appears under the name of \" Dovere.\" As the"], [101, "61 principal of the Cinque Ports it figures conspicuously in history \u2014 William the Conqueror was the first who gave to the Cinque Ports an independent jurisdic tion ; by him they were created into a sort of palatinate, with a lord warden, invested with civil, military, and naval authority, and having his seat of admini stration at the Castle of Dover. Each of the five ports had its own corporation of twelve jurats, from whom the mayor and bailiff were chosen. The Parlia mentary Reform Act of 1832 and the Municipal Act of 1835 broke up to a great extent the peculiar political and municipal organisation of the Cinque Ports, and assimilated their local govern- were commenced, the entrance was deep ened, the pier repaired, and the outer harbour enlarged to the extent of 7\u00a3 acres. In 1847 a new set of works was undertaken for the formation of a harbour of refuge, intended to enclose no less than 520 acres ; the Admiralty pier, which forms its west arm, was commenced in 1848, and has been thiown out to nearly half a mile from the shore. This portion underwent great damage by a storm on New Year's day, 1877 ; it is estimated that these gigantic works will have cost, when completed, some where about \u00a32,500,000 sterling. The other pubhc national buildings are \u2014 the custom house, the excise office, the alien DOVER CASTLE (FROM THE ENTRANCE TO THE HARBOUR). office, the royal engineers' department the military hospital, the pilots' office, the brigade office, &c. The town hall was once part of the \" Maison Dieu\" (a hospital founded by Hubert de Burgh), and was purchased from the Government by the corporation, who converted the nave of the old church into the town hall, the Lady Chapel into the Sessions hall, the vaults into dungeons, aud the tower into a residence for the governor. In 1849 the corporation erected the museum and philosophical institution ; besides which Dover contains a theatre, the Welliugton hall, and assembly rooms, the Apollonion hall, the working men's institute, the proprietary library, the philosophical institution, the youths' ment to that of other towns. Dover has a separate commission of the peace, quarter sessions, and police force. The corporation act as the urban sanitary authority, and they have established waterworks under the Local Government Act of 1858 ; the gasworks are in the hands of a joint-stock company. The castle occupies an area of thirty-five acres, on the summit of a cliff. The modern fortifications connected with the castle are very extensive. The opposite heights, known as \"the Citadel,\" are also fortified. The first works of im portance in connection with the harbour were those commenced by Henry VIII., and continued by Elizabeth and James I. In the year 1844, great improvements"], [102, "62 institute, ifec, and a monument erected to tbe memory of the officers and men of the 60th Rifles who fell in the Indian war. Before the Reformation tbe town had seven churches and several monastic establishments, including the Priory, now almost wholly gone. Of the churches two only are left \u2014 St. Mary's, a Norman edifice ; St. James's, an Anglo-Saxon building, and the new church, built in close proximity. Others are \u2014 Trinity, Christ's, and St. John's mariners' churches, a military church in the castle, and another on the western heights, with others in the suburban parishes of Charl ton, Buckland, Guston and Houghan. The Baptists, Independents, Wesleyans, Latter-day Saints, Roman Catholics, Unitarians, and Jews have chapels in the town ; and there are national, parochial, and sectarian schools. Tho charitable institutions are \u2014 the hospital and dispensary, the female home, the sailors' home, the Albert philanthropic institute, and many other charities, in cluding a set of thirty-eight almshouses, with an income of \u00a3200 per annum. \u2014 The trade of Dover, apart from that connected with the mail and packet service to the Continent, consists mainly of ship-building, rope and sail making, and the supply of ships' stores.

The inanorof Westerham was anciently in the possession of the Camville family, but reverted to the Crown at the close of the thirteenth century, when Edward I. granted it, with Edenbridge, to the Abbot of Westminster, for the per formance of masses for the repose of the soul of his beloved Queen Eleanor. The church is a large and handsome building, containing a variety of interesting tombs and brasses, especially a cenotaph in memory of General Wolfe, who was born in this town. The river Darent takes its rise in this parish, at a small dis tance south from Squeries. Two remark able phenomena, called slips, occurred here, on the southern escarpment of the sand-hill, in 1596 and 1756 : in the former, nine acres of ground continued in motion eleven days ; and iu the latter two acres and a half, some parts sinking into pits, and others rising into hills.

Dymchurch was at one time the \" capital \" of the Romney"], [104, "64 Marsh, a district that forms a peculiar \"liberty\" extending over the whole or parts of twenty-seven parishes, mostly within the lathe of Shepway. With the view of encouraging the colonization of the Marsh, it was favoured with a special jurisdiction distinct from the county ; the charters granted by Edward IV., Henry VII., Henry VIII., aud Elizabeth, constitute the inhabitants a body cor porate under the control of a bailiff and twenty-four jurats, appointed from among themselves by twenty- three lords of manors in and adjoining the Marsh, The bailiff is elected annually at Whit suntide, and he and four other jurats appointed by the bailiff, jurats, and com monalty, annually on Michaelmas Day, are the magistrates.

EDENBRIDGE. \u2014 (STATION.) \u2014 A small town and parish of the county of Kent (western division) ; in Seven- oaks union and petty sessional division, and Tunbridge county court district. The town derives its name from a bridge over the Eden. The town contains several chalybeate springs, strongly impregnated with iron, and one with sulphate of magnesia. Iron mines were formerly wrought in the hills, in the southern part of tho parish. The church, dedi- cated to St. Peter and St. Paul, is a large, striking building, having a spire- steeple at the west end, and in an early and later English style. A handsome national school corresponds with the architecture of the church. A walk of about three miles south-east of the station, or by a pleasant route from the town along by-lanes and field-paths, brings the tourist to Hever Castle, erected in the reign of Edward III. by William de Hevre, from which family it came by marriage to the Cobhams of this county, from whom it derived the com pound name of Hever- Cobham ; it was by one of that family sold to Sir Geoffry Bulleyne, Knight, the grandfather of the unfortunate Anne, who was born here. The castle was afterwards tho residence of the repudiated Anne of Cleves, who died here in 1556, after a quiet sojourn of sixteen years. She died in the fourth year of Philip and Mary, at which time the castle reverted to the Crown. It was given by Mary to Sir Edward Waldegrave, whose family in 1715 conveyed it to Sir William Hum- phreys, Bart. ; and in the year 1745 it was sold to Timothy Waldo, Esq. Little is seen of the castle until it is closely approached, owing to its lying in so low a spot.

The church of St. Peter consists of chancel, nave, and transepts, in the early English style of architecture. There is a handsome school, with master's house attached, in connection with the church, supported by voluntary contri butions, in which boys and girls receive a sound plain education at a trifling cost. The Reading Cemetery is in this parish. The district of Earley contains, amongst other properties of note and interest, the ancient domain of Whiteknights (for-"], [105, "\u25a0-,r, enclosing a courtyard. The principal part is the fortified portion, and consists of a large and lofty gate-house, flanked by two square towers. It is built of stone, and is evidently of great strength. Over the gateway impend bold machico- lations, from which missiles might be poured on the heads of assailants. The towers are pierced with \u0153illets and loop- holes, through which arrows might be discharged. Three stout gates, and as many portcullises, are arranged, one behind the other, within the gateway. In the gate-house are guard-rooms ; the chambers above were provided with fur- naces for melting lead and pitch. The interior of the castle is in tolerable pre- servation. Among other things shown to the stranger, is Anne Boleyn's bed- room. It is worth seeing, although but scantily furnished ; but what furniture there is is ancient. The bed is affirmed to be the veritable one she slept in : it is antique-looking, with heavy hanging curtains. The chairs and tables, and a strong, carved oak chest, are said to have belonged to the Boleyns. The village of Hever was formerly part of the extensive patrimony of Sir Steven de Penchester, or Penshurst. The church is dedicated to St. Peter ; and is for the most part decorated. The Boieyn chapel is of the late perpendicular style. In the Boieyn chantry is a beautiful brass to Sir Thomas Boieyn. There are several other brasses in good preservation. In the interior of the church is a stately tomb, in marble, to the memory of Sir Thomas Boieyn, who died in 1538. There are also memorials of the Cobham and Waldo families. Near Hever is tbe picturesque village of Chiddingstone. The church, dedicated to St. Mary, is a large, old, and handsome building, with a tower, con- sidered one of the finest in the couuty. In the interior are some fine monuments to the Streatfeild family.] Market Days : Every second and fourth Tuesday in the month. Fair : A fat-stock show in De- cember. Area : 5,287 acres.

ELTHAM.\u2014 (STATION .)\u2014 A town and parish of the county of Kent (western division) ; in Lewisham Union and Greenwich county court and police district. It is also within the jurisdic tions of the Metropolitan Police and Central Criminal Court. The ancient palace of Eltham was one of the most magnificent royal residences in England. The property is ascertained to have be longed to the Crown in the time of the Saxons. The Conqueror granted it to one of his Norman followers ; but having again been forfeited to the Crown, it passed into the possession of Anthony Bee, the famous military bishop of Durham. He is the earliest proprie tor of the manor who is recorded to have erected any buildings on the site of the palace \u2014 although there can be little doubt that there was a house there be fore his time. He built a splendid mansion, which appears to have been completed soon after the middle of the thirteenth century; King Henry III., accompanied by his queen and all the principal nobility, having kept his Christmas here in 1269. On the death of the bishop, which occurred at this place in 1310, the manor of Eltham fell again to the Crown, in the possession of which it has since remained. For the next two centuries the place was a favourite residence of our monarchs. John, son of Edward II., was born here in 1315. In the reign of Edward III., the parliament was, on several occasions, assembled at Eltham ; and here tbat prince, in 1365, entertained, his captive, John, King of France, with sumptuous hospitality. The palace was afterwards almost entirely rebuilt by Edward IV., who, on the con clusion of the work in 1482, is recorded to have kept his Christmas in the hall with great state and splendour. Large additions were afterwards made to the building by Henry VII., who, like hi3 predecessors, generally lived here, and was wont to dine every day in the hall surrounded by his barons. At this time the royal palace of Eltham"], [106, "66 consisted of four quadrangles, enclosed within a high wall, beyond which was a moat of great width. The whole formed gateway in the north wall. There waB also another bridge and gate at the opposite side of the enclosure. Of tho ELTlsAM PALACE (FROM AN OLD PRINT), an irregular area, approaching to a square in shape, to which the principal entry was over a bridge and through a I buildings, the most important part con sisted of a high range, which crossed the I court from cast to west, and included the"], [107, "67 hall, the chapel, and the state apart ments. To the palace were attached a garden and three parks, comprehending together about 1,300 acres, besides the demesne lauds of 4,000 acres more. These parks were stocked with deer, and many fine old trees that still remain testify how richly wooded the place must have been formerly. Of all this magnificence, but little now remains ; and many parts of the buildings can scarcely be traced even in their foundations. Henry VIII. deserted Eltham for the new palace of Greenwich. After this, the spot was rarely visited by the Sovereign. At the Commonwealth, a palace so im pregnated with royalty could not but be distasteful to the rigid soldiers of Crom well ; so it was seized and sold ; and at the same time, the parks were broken into, and the deer dispersed and killed. The work of devastation thus begun, was continued until the greater part of the palace was reduced to ruin. Al though the property reverted to the Crown at the Restoration, no pains were taken to protect the relics from violence and spoliation. On the con trary, the old palace was turned into a quarry, and all the materials tbat could be converted into use were gradually removed. Fortunately for the hall, it was considered, by some influential observer on the spot, that it would make a good barn, and to this accidental circumstance we are chiefly indebted for its preservation. The three parks at- tached to the palace, with the demesne lands, extended over 1,652 acres, on which grew 7,700 trees. The royal hall is visible during the winter months at a considerable distance, and from various points of Blackheath and its vicinity forms au interesting landmark to the stranger. In summer, however, when the luxuriant foliage of the trees expands on every side, it is only seen by glimpses through the straggling trees of the park. In the immediate approach, the first objects that arrest the attention are masses of ancient wall, very thickly mantled with ivy, and at the base of which the water of the original moat still keeps its bed. Over this an old bridge of three arches conducts to the \u2022enclosure once covered over with the habitations of royalty, the lodgings for numerous retainers, aud displaying the magnificence for which the Court in olden times was famous, but now re duced to this solitary hall, flanked on the left by several dwellings. Tho situation of this palace must have been eminently striking. Standing on a height of greater elevation than any iu the immediate district, except Shooter's Hill, the ground sloped gently away towards the west, over a rich and in teresting landscape, including Black heath, Greenwich Park, and the Surrey hills, between which stood London, with the lofty spire of the old cathedral of St. Paul in view, and the insulated pile of Westminster Abbey, then with - out towers ; the distant heights of Highgate terminating the background. On entering tho great ball, a screen, once elaborately carved, and running across the building, opens a thorough fare to a corresponding entrance on tlie opposite side. In the centre of the screen is an inner door to the hall. The noble proportions of this magnificent apartment are apparent at a glance. Tho purposes of a common barn to which the hall was long applied, have materially altered and defaced some of its most striking features ; but enough will be seen to awaken the admiration of every lover of olden art. The magni ficent roof, owing to judicious repara tions made several years since at tbe expense of Government, and under the superintendence of Mr. Smirke, is now in good condition. It is wholly constructed of chestnut. The main beams are seventeen inches square and twenty-eight feet loug, perfectly straight and sound throughout. A forest must have yielded its choicest timber for the supply of this building, and it is evident that the material has been wrought with incredible labour and admirable skill. The length of the hall is rather more than a hundred feet, the breadth thirty-six, and the height forty five feet, lt has five double windows on each side, exclusive of the great bays, at the end of which was the chief entrance into the state apartments. At the upper, or north end, was the high dais, slightly elevated and running across the hall. The two great bow windows at either side are adorned with beautiful flowing tracery, and in style and proportions are magnificent. As-"], [108, "68 ciently indicate the lapse of time since these passages were entered.\" The town of Eltham is small, but agreeably situated : the area of the parish contains 3,712 acres. The church, dedicated to St. John, is a plain structure, but it contains several interesting monuments, particularly one to John Lilburne, who acted a conspicuous part during the Commonwealth, and in tbe events which preceded that era, In the churchyard are interred the remains of Dr. George Home, Bishop of Norwich, and Doggett, the comedian, who bequeathed a coat and badge to be rowed for on the Thames annually, on the 1st of August.

ERITH. \u2014 (STATION.)\u2014 A town and parish of the county of Kent (western division) ; in Dartford union, county court district, and petty sessional divi sion. Erith mainly consists of one principal and irregular street. On the eastern side of the town the pretty river Darent contributes its waters to the Thames; it is joined by the Cray, another \" faire \" river, in the marshes ; the former rising near Westerham, the latter near Orpington ; the conjoined rivers enter the Thames near \" Long Reach Tavern.\" The pier was built in 1842, and is 444 feet long. Erith was anciently called Lesnes. Lambarde relates an interesting event that occurred here about a century preceding the Conquest, in which St. Dunstan figures in the recovery of certain lands under ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Another historical event is recorded at a later period, when Henry VIII. rested at Erith on his way to meet Francis I. The ancient church, which is ren dered additionally picturesque from the ivy which almost entirely mantles it, formerly possessed a somewhat dis figured interior, arising from a want of tact in its arrangement ; it was com pletely restored in 1877. In a corner of the chancel is an interesting marblu monument, much dilapidated, but still bearing evidences of its former splen dour. The carved work around its sides exhibits traces of the various colours and gilding with which it has been cording to Mr. Buckler, who published a valuable account of this palace, \" the taste and talent of ages are consecrated in the design of this interior ; and it is scarcely possible to imagine proportions more just and noble, a plan more perfect, ornaments more appropriate and beautiful ; in a word, a whole more harmonious than this regal banqueting room.\" This hall was undoubtedly the erection of Edward IV., whose well-known symbol, the expanded rose, is still to be seen on some portions of the building. In 1836 a discovery was made of some subterranean passages connected with the old palace. A pamphlet published at Greenwich at the time gave the following account of these undergound communications : \u2014 \" Tradition (it is said) has always kept up a belief of the existence of an under ground passage to Blackheath, from Greenwich; and it was affirmed in the neighbourhood that at Middle Park, connected with these passages, there were one or more apartments under ground for sixty horses.\" The account then proceeds : \" Under the ground floor of one of the apartments of the palace, a trap-door opens into a room underground, ten feet by five feet ; and proceeding from it, a narrow passage, of about ten feet in length, conducts the passenger to a series of passages with decoys, stairs, aud shafts, some of which are vertical, and otheic; on an inclined plane, which were once used for admit ting air, and for hurling down missiles and pitch balls upon enemies, according to the mode of defence in those ancient times; and it is worthy of notice that, at poiuts where weapons from above could assail the enemy with greater effect, these shafts verge and concentrate. About five hundred feet of passage have been entered, and passed through in a direction west, towards Middle Park, and under the moat for two hundred feet. The arch is broken into in the field leading from Eltham to Motting ham; but still the brickwork of the arch can be traced further in the same direction. The remains of two iron gates, completely carbonized, were found in that part of the passage under the moat ; and large stalactites, formed of super-carbonite of lime, hung down from the roof of the arch, which suffi-"], [109, "69 richly ornamented, and the recumbent figure possesses all the quaintness and simplicity of the old monumental effigies. Thero is neither inscription nor date remaining on the tomb, but it is well known as that of Elizabeth, Countess of Shrewsbury and Countess of Pembroke, who received a grant of Erith manor from Henry VIII. Scattered over the pavement of the chancel are two or three very perfect brasses ; and near the altar is a piece of sculpture, by Chantrey, to the memory of Lord Eardley, father-in-law of the late Lord Saye and Sele, and a former possessor of Belvedere. The most con spicuous tomb in tbe churchyard is an obelisk dedicated to the memory of Henry Dismore. Within the church of Erith a meeting was held, in the reign of John, between the King's com missioners and a party of the dis contented barons. There are Wesleyan, Congregational, Baptist, and Catholic chapels. A School Board for the whole of tbe civil parish was established in 1871. Erith is a favourite station for various yacht clubs and the headquarters of the Corinthian Yacht Club. Extensive brick fields lie on the eastern boundary of the parish ; and the excavation of the hills, from which sand is transported by steam tramways as ballast for merchant ships in the port of London, has given to one portion of the parish a peculiar appear ance. The Public Hall is a brick build ing, used for public meetings, concerts, and assemblies. Many villas have been built on the wooded heights overlooking the river ; and the bank cf the Thames is occupied by many factories, and the iron foundry of Messrs. Eastons and Anderson, which gives employment to over a thousand hands. The Metro politan Main Drainage southern outfall works are at Crossness point, in this parish. Belvedere House, Erith, is a spacious edifice of brick, devoid of all exterior ornament, yet of good archi tectural proportions. The interior consists of elegant suites of rooms, ornamented with a valuable collection of paintings, many by the first masters of ancient times, and several by the most eminent painters of our own country. The grounds around the mansion are extensive, and arranged with great taste. The views of the river that occasionally present them selves through opening trees, or the bolder prospect of the noble stream as seen from some neighbouring hillock, are very fine.

The village is on the borders of the county of Surrey, and comprises Aldershot (North Camp) within its boundary. The parish pos sesses several large mansions and hand some villa residences ; many are induced to reside permanently in the place owing to the salubrity of the district and its contiguity to the Camp. The parish church is an ancient building. Area : 2,208 acres. Population: 2,597 (ex-"], [110, "70 either by the Danes or by the inroad of the sea, in 1052. Her father built a castle and church here in 630 ; and a priory for Benedictine monks, with a church, was founded by Nevil de Man deville in 1092, at first on tho site of tho old nunnery, but afterwards removed, in consequence of the devastations of the soa, to the site where the present church stands. This establishment shared the fate of all other monasteries in the reign of Henry VIII., and the only remains at present oxisting are the priory house, which, about the year 1650 had become the property of John Dixwell, Esq., one of the judges of Charles I., and who also signed the warrant for his execution. Folkestone is a member of the Cinque Port of Dover, and was formerly placed under the same jurisdiction as the other Cinque ports. The town has received several charters, that of Charles II. being the governing one until the Muni cipal Act came into operation. That statute provided for a council, compris ing a mayor, four aldermen, and twelve councillors (since increased to fifteen), and a court of quarter sessions, with a recorder, police force, &c. The Urban Sanitary Authority is now vested in an Improvement Commission, which in 1855 secured the \" Folkestone Improve ment Act,\" and executed main drain age works, at a cost of more than \u00a36,000. The water works are at Cherry Gardens, and there is an efficient gas supply. The older and lower quarters of the town are very irregularly built, having steep and narrow streets, which, nevertheless, are clean and well paved. The modern town is regularly laid out, and built on the cliffs, the front forming a much-admired promenade, called \" The Lees,\" from wliich steps and a sloping road give access to the beach. The style of the houses is very good, some of them adapted as lodging-houses being of a very large size, aud of attractive appearance. The pathway along the cliffs, between this portion of the town and Sandgate, forms one of the most charming walks which can possibly be conceived, the view from it being unsur passed in beauty and variety.

FOLKESTONE. \u2014 (Stations\u2014 FOLKESTONE TOWN and JUNC TION and FOLKESTONE HAR BOUR.) \u2014 A municipal (and, in conjunc tion with Hythe, a parliamentary) borough of East Kent ; a seaport, mar ket town, and parish, united with Dover as one of the Cinque Ports, in the hun dred and county court district of Folke stone, lathe of Shepway, union of Elham, and archdeaconry and diocese of Canterbury ; 17 miles from Canterbury, 15 from Ashford, and 5 from Dover. The route to and from the Continent via Folkestone and Boulogne has, under the present management of the South Eastern system, become the most fa voured by all classes of travellers, and is the one now generally used by royal and distinguished personages. The sea journey is very little in excess of the distance vid Calais and Dover, and now occupies twenty minutes less time than that route, owing to the magnificent steamers which have been put on the service (see page xi). The railway journey between the two capitals is lesseuedby 28 miles,and the whole j ourney from London to Paris, or vice versa, can now be accomplished by this route in a few minutes over eight hours. The South Eastern Company have much im proved Folkestone harbour and the packet service, ant) have infused a spirit of activity into the French authorities and officials with the view of adding to the already increased facilities afforded by the Northern Railway of Franco. With larger harbours and boats it is expected the duration of the journey from London to Paris will be still more reduced. Folkestone lays claim to very high anti quity, and has been supposed, from the coins and other relics discovered in the neighbourhood, to have been known to the Romans. It was called by the Saxons\" Folcestane,\" and appears inthe Domesday Book under the name of \" Falchestan.\" The first nunnery in England was established here by St. Eanswitha, the daughter of Eadbald, king of Kent, of which she herself became first prioress, but which was destroyed,"], [111, "71 by visitors. The parish church of St. Mary and St. Eanswythe is an ancient structure. The chancel is of the early part of the twelfth century ; and in the north wall is an anc'ent tomb, with buttresses at the sides, and a range of trefoils in open work beneath the lower mouldings of the arch ; in front is a row of small mutilated figures ; and upon the tomb lies the effigy of a knight in armour, with his head resting on a helmet, and his feet on a lion. The monument is supposed to belong to some member of the Seagrave or Sandwich families. Against the east wall of tho south aisle is an altar tomb of variegated marble, in memory of the Herdsons, once lords of the manor. A brass plate in the nave records the name and character of Joan, mother of the celebrated discoverer of the circulation of tha blood, Dr. Harvey, who was a native of Folkestone. The rest of the edifice, both inside and out, is of very difftrent periods, and incongruous in character; it was completely restored and largely improved in 1809. There are four other churches \u2014 Christ Church (built in 1850, at the solo expense of the Earl cf Radnor, lord of the manor, and partly endowed by him) ; St. Peter's, erected in 1863 ; Holy Trinity, also built by tho Earl of Radnor, in 1868 ; and St. Michael aud All Angels, opened in 1873. Tlie Wesleyan, Congregationalist, Bap tist, Primitive Methodist, and Friends denominations have places of worship here. Sir Eliab Harvey's free grammar school has been rebuilt ; it was founded in 1674, and Dr. Harvey contributed to iis support by his will. The Town Hall was erected in 1860, on the site of the old one : it is in the Italian style, with plain rusticated ground floor and Cor inthian columns, and entablature above, with clock chamber, containing an illu minated clock by Messrs. Gillett <fe Bland, of Croydon : the large hall is about eighty feet by fifty feet in size, and there are council, magistrates', com mittee, and other rooms in the building, with police station and market under. The bathing establishment stands at the base of the cliff beneath \" The Lees.\" On the lower tier is a large swimming and plunge bath, and also every description of medicated and invalid baths : the first floor is devoted toa scries of warm and cold baths, fitted in excellent style \u2014 one side for ladies, and the other for gentlemen \u2014 and the upper tier is set apart for the sub scription and assembly rooms, which are furnished in the samo manner and pos sess all the characteristics of the best London clubs, comprising reading, bil liard, and refreshment rooms, besides the large saloon, which is used for the balls and concerts that take place period ically, and at other times as a general lounge for the subscribers : it was opened in July, 1869, and is the property of a joint-stock company. If we except a small fishing and coasting trade, there is no business at all carried on in Folke stone, apart from that which is the natu ral consequence of its being the South Eastern Railway Company's harbour of embarkation and debarkation to and from the Continent. No harbour existed at Folkestone prior to the time of Henry VIII., and the works which were con structed under his orders were not re markable for strength. Henry visited the town in 1543, and a portion of his army embarked here for France. The town records of the years 1635, 1654, and 1699, show that effoits were made to keep open the harbour which here, as at Dover, was constantly choked up by tho accumulation of shingle, but it seems that they were insufficient, for in 1725 the inhabitants petitioned the Govern ment to grant them letters patent to collect charitable subscriptions through out the kingdom to repair the damages the harbour had sustained. An Act of Parliament was obtained in 1766 to raise money for the purpose of repairing the harbour, and for new works, which were to be maintained by a duty levied or. coals. In 1807 another Act of Parlia ment was obtained for making a new harbour, the capital being \u00a322,000 in shares of \u00a350; \u00a337,500 more was ob tained in the same manner, and a further sum of \u00a310,000 was borrowed of tho Government on mortgage. These sums were not, however, sufficient for the com pletion of the works, and the harbour, being again left to itself, soon became, as before, filled up with shingle and sand. In 1842 it was purchased by the South Eastern Railway Company, and the first step they adopted for arresting the shingle, was the carrying out a gre've, formed with piles, from tbe south-west 7"], [112, "72 arm of the pier, which graduaUy led to the formation of a breakwater. This stopped the further accumulation of shingle in the harbour, which was then, at great expense, effectually cleared. This breakwater has been greatly im proved by constructions of masonry intended to bind the work together ; and at the same time great addi tions and improvements have been made both in the foundations and superstruc tures of the original piers, ln fact, Folkestone Harbour \u2014 now 14 acres in extent, with an entrance 123 feet wide \u2014 has, owing to these improvements, twenty feet of water when the tide is in, and is capable of being entered by steamers three hours and a half after high water ; during neap-tides there are occasionally four or five feet of water in the entrance at low water, and, immediately outside, sufficient for a steamer to take her pas sengers from the pier-head and work herself clearly off. The new pier enables passengers to land and embark at all times of the tide. The Harbour House, the residence of the Marine Superinten dent, was erected in 1843 ; it is of the Venetian style of architecture, and has a tower 100 feet in height, with an illumi jated clock. A magnificent view of the French coast is obtainable from the gallery at the top of the building. The custom house is a very handsome edifice, situated on the Quay, adjoin ing the Harbour Station; alongside of which are waiting and refreshment rooms, from which the passengers can at once step into the boats or trains. The Pavilion Hotel, on the west side of the harbour, is the property of the Railway Company. It is constructed almost en tirely of red brick with stone-dressings, and, although exceedingly plain, possesses an aspect of old - fashioned comfort. Market Day : Thursday.

FORDWICH. \u2014 (Station\u2014 GROVE FERRY\u2014 1 mile.) -An anoient town and corporate member of the cinque port of Sandwich, in the county of Kent (eastern division). It is in Bridge union and Canterbury county court district ; is distant two miles from Canterbury. The corporation style is \" the mayor, jurats, commonalty,\" (fee. The mayor and jurats are justices of the peace by virtue of their offices, but it is seldom the number specified in the governing charter is kept up. The first charter was granted by Henry II., and the second by King Edward. The corpora tion has authority for an unlimited criminal jurisdiction, and a hundred court and court of requests, but they are practically obsolete. Fordwich was formerly a place of some importance ; the sea then flowing up the river Stour rendered it navigable for ships of con siderable size, which frequented this port. The river is still navigable for barges as far as the bridge above the town. The church of St. Mary consists of chancel, nave and north aisle. The Town Hall was rebuilt in 1555, and has been restored ; it is a square wooden framed building, with gaol underneath. There is an old ducking stool, in which scolds were formerly bound and ducked in the Stour; the feswelle (or thieves' well, in which felons were drowned \u2014 that being the general mode of execu tion in the Cinque Ports), is still shown. Near the Town Hall are the remains of an old fort. The corporate area extends over the whole of the parish (excepting a small portion on which there are no houses, and which is comprised in the boundaries of the city of Canterbury), of Fordwich and part of the parish of Sturry. Area : About 500 acres. Population: 224. FRANT\u2014 (STATION.)\u2014 A village and parish of the county of Sussex; in Ticehurst union, Tunbridge Wells connty court district, and Frant petty ses sional division. A small portion of the parish is in the county of Kent. St. Alban's Church is ancient, and contains monuments to the Abergavenny, Weller"], [113, "73 and Browm families. Both village and church are romantically situated on the brow of a hill, and command most extensive views. Frant Court was for merly the seat of Lord Stratford de Redcliffe. To the west of Frant, but not visible from the line, stands the noble demesne of the Marquis of Aber gavenny, Eridge Castle (once one of the principal seats of the far-famed Neville family), an irregular but splendid cas tellated Gothic pile, the front cf which is almost covered with ivy and other creeping plants. It stands in a well wooded and watered park, abundantly stocked with deer, and comprising about 3,000 acres of land, being also sur rounded by about 10,000 more, all in cluded within the estate. The park plantations have been arranged with consummate taste, and nurtured with such care that many of tho trees have attained an enormous growth ; and within the park is a variety of rides (said to measure altogether fifty-four miles), which conduct to scenes of various characters, and occasionally embrace the most interesting objects in the adjacent country. In a part of tho park, near Frant, on a lofty knoll, 659 feet above the level of the sea, are the remains of au ancient circular encampment, said to be Saxon. The hill is therefore called \" Saxonbury Hill.\" In 1828, a round tower was erected in nearly the centre of the entrenchments. The neighbour- hood abounds with mansions (including Shernfold Park), and genteel villa-resi- dences, among the prettiest of which is Saxonbury Lodge, the grounds of which are laid out with great taste, and com- mand fine views of Eridge Park and the surrounding country. About three miles and a half, also, to the east of the line in this part of its course is Bayham Abbey, a demesne of the Marquis Camden, originally built about the year 1200 for Premonstratensian Monks, or White Canons, and dissolved at the Reformation, when its revenues were applied by Wolsey to the erection of colleges at Ipswich and Oxford : it was afterwards forfeited to the Crown, and granted by Elizabeth to Viscount Mon- tague, whose descendants sold it to Lord Chief Justice Pratt, ancestor of the present marquis.

This place is famous as being \u2014 next to Old Sarum\u2014 the most notorious of the \" rotten ' ' boroughs which existed prior to the Reform Act of 1832. At the time of its disfran chisement, there was stated to be seven voters in all to return the two members of Parliament, but practically there were not more than three \u2014 namely, the lord of the manor, his agent and the rector. Gatton Park, the property of Lord Monson, is a beautiful domain, with a large sheet of water \u2014 covering more than 30 acres \u2014 known as \" The Lake.\" At the sale of the manor and Estate, previous to the Reform Bill of 1832, the auctioneer, in describing the property, is stated to have made use of these words, to describe its charming scenery : \" Open wide the gates of Paradise, and you enter Gatton Park.\" The parish church is an old building, in the Early English style. Between Gatton and Redhill, at a place called Battle Bridge, the Danes are alleged to have been defeated with great slaughter, by the Saxons. Area: 296 acres. Population : 267.

GRAVESEND. \u2014 (STATION.)- A parliamentary (returning one member) and municipal borough of Mid Kent ; a market town, parish, poor-law union, and seaport, in the lathe of Aylesford, hundred of Toltingtrough, and deanery, archdeaconry, and diocese of Rochester, situated on the right bank of the Thames, 2 1 miles below London ; it is also a station, by means of a ferry to Tilbury, on the London and Southern! Railway. It has communication with London by steam-packets on the river and with Rochester (seven mile3 dis tant), <fec. The town is called \" Graves ham \" in Domesday Book, and at that time contained the three manors of Gravesend, Milton, and Parrock, which it still retains, held respectively by the Eai 1 of Darnley, Joseph Harvey, Esq., and the Corporation of Gravesend. In a charter granting the tithes of the town upon St. Augustine's Monastery at Can terbury, it is denominated \" Graves hendo.\" According to Leland, \" in the begynning of the tyme of Richard II., the Frenchmen entered the mouth of the Thaimes, and brent and spoyled al the way that they came, and at last, approaching this toune, set on fyre and .spoyled it alsoe. Kinge Henry VIII. buylded a block house at this toune, and foure others not farre from it.\" The forts now existing for the defence of the town and the approach to tbe metropolis are Tilbury, on the opposite shore, where Queen Elizabeth reviewed her troops on charity\u2014 hence \" Goda's alms,\" or \" God-aiming.\" The manor was formerly the property of the episcopal see of Salis bury. Queen Elizabeth first incor porated Godalming in the year 1575, under the style of \" the warden and inhabitants;\" the warden to be chosen on Michaelmas day, out of eight assist ants. The borough finally came under the provisions of the Municipal Reform Act. A commission of the peace, separate from the county, was granted in 1879, and the borough has its own police force. Edward III., in the 20th year of his reign, exempted the town by charter from several tolls. The urban sanitary authority is now vested in the corporation. The cemetery is controlled by a burial board. A private company supplies the gas of the borough. The public buildings comprise the parish church of SS. Peter and Paul, dating from temp. Henry VII., four dissent ing chapels, national, British and infant schools, town hall, market house, new public hall, county court, police station and Wyatt's almshouses. There are a few small charities. The Charterhouse Schools are in tbe borough, and, from their position, form a conspicuous land mark. Trade, Manufactures, &c. : For merly the manufacture of kerseys flourished here, but it is now decayed. The present manufactures are stockings, gloves, flannels, baizes, paper, parchment, and leather. There is also a small trade in timber carried on. Market Days : Wednesdays and Saturdays.

GODSTONE. \u2014 (STATION.)\u2014 A village and parish of the county of Surrey (eastern division), in Godstone union and petty sessional division, and Reigate county court district. The station is at Lagham \u2014 three miles dis tant from the village \u2014 and adjoining the parish of Bletchingley, which, pre vious to the Reform Act of 1832, was a borough, returning two members to Parliament, the number of voters being about twenty. At Castle Hill and Godstone Green are remains of Roman encampments. The parish church is a restored building of the Early English style. Firestone and lime quarries"], [115, "75 the approach of the Spanish Armada, and three other forts on the Kentish coast. In August, 1850, a fire broke out which destroyed houses and property of the value of \u00a3100,009, the rebudding of which has been a great improvement to the town. Gravesend was enfranchised by the Reform Act of 1867. It was not incorporated until the reign of Elizabeth, when tbe government of the town was entrusted, by charter, to a mayor, deputy mayor, eleven jurats, and twenty-four common councilmen, with a recorder, high steward, chamberlain, ite. In 16 2)4., the Corporation purchased the manor of Parrock, which comprehended the right of ferry across the river, the site of the town hall, the market place, and the free school. The Corporation act as the urban sanitary authority. The waterworks i.nd gasworks are in the hands of private companies. There is also a cemetery. The old parish church of Gravesend was burnt down in the reign of George II., and rebuilt at a cost of \u00a33,000, when its name was altered to St. George's, in honour of the reigning monarch. The parish church of Milton, dedicated lo St. Peter and St. Paul, was built in the fifteenth century, and Holy Trinity Church, iu Milton, in 1848 ; St. James's was built in 1851, on a site given by the Earl of Darnley, and Christ Church in the year 1852. The Roman Catholic Church of St. John the Evangelist, a fine structure, was erected in 183 1, at a cost of \u00a37,000. The Wesleyans, Baptists, Independents, Primitive Methodists, and Mormons have chapels in the town. The town hall, where the quarter and petty sessions are held, and the county court, where all municipal business is trans acted, were rebuilt in 1836, at a cost of \u00a33,000, and have offices for the police, fire brigade, <fec, with dwellings for the superintendents, and underneath is the market house. It is a Doric building, with pillars and emblematic figures on its facade. Other public buildings are \u2014 the assembly rooms, built in 1841-2, at a cost of \u00a33,000, with au organ, and accommodation for 1,000 people, a fine building with an Ionic portico ; the Workmen's Hall, Milton Mount College (a large and beautiful building for daughters of Congregational ministers), Parrock Hall (an industrial school for boys), the theatre, the dispensary and infirmary ; the town pier, completed in 1834, whence is the ferry to Tilbury, built at a cost of \u00a330,0 .10 ; the Royal Terrace pier, erected in 1845, and costing \u00a39,200, for the use of the Blackwall steam-packets ; and the Rosherville pier, for the use of passengers visiiing the well-known gardens of that name. Windmill Hill is a place of resort for juvenile excursionists. The institutions include a free grammar school, founded in 1580 ; there are thirty boys on the foundation, but it has since been in corporated with the National Society. Almshouses, built in 1836, accommodate thirty aged persons of both sexes, and there aro numerous other charities aud charitable bequests. Gravesend being the boundary*- of the port of London, customs afficers and pilots embark aud disembark here in respect of vessels from and to foreign ports. It is a place also where troops and passengers embark for long voyages, to avoid the passage down the river, and many royal and illustrious personages have landed here. It has carried on a flourishing trade, greater formerly than now, in supplying out ward-bound ships with stores. Besides this, the chief trades of the town are \u2014 fishing for shrimps, cod, turbot, ifec , and that of watermen in going with pas sengers and goods to and from passing vessels.

GREENHITHE. \u2014 (STATION.) \u2014 An ecclesiastical parish (formed out of the civil parishes of Swanscombe and Stow) of the county of Kent (western"], [116, "76 series of low trefoil-headed arches, in relief, spring from small pillars of Pet worth marble, and, most probably, a similar range of arches rested on the projecting plinth beneath the windows of the nave. In the pavement of the chancel a curious brass monument will be observed to John Lambarde, rector of this parish, who died in 1408. The tombs of the Wiltshires are curious. The eastern pointed window is large and handsome. Rather less than a mile from the church stands Stow Castle, a private mansion built on the site of an ancient Norman fortress, dating from the time of Edward HI. Of this castle a small square tower, covered with ivy, is the only relic of the olden edifice. Swanscombe is said to derive its name from Swine's camp, the Danish king Sweyn having erected a castle here to preserve a winter station for his ships. This place is also said to be the spot where the march of William the Con queror was impeded by the m en of Kent until he had consented to grant them a full confirmation of all their ancient laws and privileges. The manor-house is an ancient building, formerly the seat of the Weldon family. The manor is said to be the oldest in the county. The church is an ancient edifice, uninterest ing as regards its outward appearance, and presenting a plain interior. It con tains, however, some important monu ments erected in the early part of the seventeenth century to members of the Weldon family ; one in particular to Sir Ralph Weldon, who was chief clerk of the kitchen to Queen Elizabeth, and died in 1609. His effigy and that of his lady are represented in a recumbent attitude, and at their feet are the effigies of a son and a daughter. Three other sons and five daughters are represented, kneeling in front of the tomb. In the woods south of the church are some re markable caverns, called Clappernapper'a Hole, to which is attached some interest ing legend. The wood is much resorted to by gipsy parties.

Greenhithe consists of a main street, with a pier in the Thames, for the convenience of steam-boat passengers. The appearance of the place from the river is very picturesque. Its red brick cottages and tall chalk cliffs project boldly forward from the dark woods of Swanscombe, which, stretching far away inland, bound the distant horizon. From here started, on May 24th, 1845, the ill fated fifty-eighth exploring expedition to the Polar Seas, the Erebus and Terror, being under the command of the lamented Sir John Franklin, and Captains Crozier and Fitzjames. Within view of the river is the celebrated Ingress Abbey. This large mansion was built by the late Alderman Harmer out of the stone from Old London Bridge. It is a structure in the Tudor-Gothic style of architecture, and with its luxuriant wooded park is an object of great attraction. Near it are the ruins of a nunnery. Here are also a number of very excellent family resi dences ; the handsome row of semi detached villas in the Italian style at Cobham-terrace occupy a fine position, on an eminence overlooking a great extent of country. At Greenhithe are Roman cement works, chalk and lime works, and some market-gardening. A short distance to the right of Greenhithe, within the compass of a ten minutes' walk, and crowning an eminence which overlooks the Thames, stands Stow Church, dedicated to St. Mary, one of the most interesting edifices in this part of Kent. Two centuries since, its fine embattled tower was surmounted by a lofty octagonal spire, supported at the sides by elegant flying buttresses , but a terrific thunderstorm hurled part of it down, melting the bells as they hung, and made the speedy removal of the remainder necessary. It has a square massive tower at the west end, embattled, which is curiously constructed. The visitor will be sure to notice the fine proportions of the north doorway, and the richness of its decorative mouldings, which are still to be traced, though much injured by time. Pointed arches, spring ing from clusters of slender columns, separate the side aisles from the nave. A richly-decorated arch divides the nave again from the chancel, around which a"], [117, "77 metropolitan area, and county of Kdnt (western division) ; it is the chief centre of a union, county court, and police dis trict in the Metropolitan Police, London School Board, and Central Criminal Court districts. The station at Green wich is situated about two huudred yards from the parish church. Opposite the station are the Almshouses, founded in the reign of Elizabeth ; and further on, towards the town, at the corner of Royal Hill, are baths and wash-houses, near to wliich may be observed the new lecture hall, which cost \u00a3(,,000, and is capable of holding a thousand persons. The library attached to this establish ment contains over eight thousand vo lumes. The route is easily followed to the Royal Hospital (see engraving at page\u00e6zi-.), the great point of attraction to travellers from all parts of the world. Finding the old palace of Placentia to be in a state of decay, Charles II. caused it to be partly taken down, and a splendid pile of buildings to be erected in its place. This now forms the north-west wing of the hospital. It was built under tho direction of Webb, son-in-law to Inigo Jones, and became the occasional residence cf Charles. The structure which this monarch left un- finished, William III. granted, with the grounds thereunto belonging, to be converted into a hospital for aged and disabled seamen. The architect was the celebrated Sir Christopher Wren, who undertook to superintend the work without emolument. The hospital is divided into four wings, built principally of Portland stone ; two of these front the river, and two the park. The north- west wing next the river is that erected by Charles IL The north-east wing is called Queen Anne's building. In the south-west wing, called King Wil- liam's Building, is the Painted Hall, which we shall have occasion to de- and chapel, from each of which is conti nued a noble colonnade of the Doric order, 347 feet in length, and terminating with the palace of Henrietta Maria, con sort of Charles II., now the Naval Asylum, above which is seen the Royal Observatory on an eminence in the park. On the west wharf of the hospital is the obelisk, of Aberdeen red granite, erected to the memory of the chivalric Lieutenant Bellot, of Arctic celebrity. It stands on a plinth and three steps. The obelisk itself is highly polished, and the faces of the other work are \" fine-axed.\" On the plinth is cut the simple inscription, \" Bellot.\" On the opposite side of thepedestal is abronze tablet recording the sad event of his death. This monument is a prominent object from the river, being about thirty-four feet in height, and is an ap propriate tribute to one of the noblest sons of France. In crossing the broad walk of the central square, the statue of George II. , by Rysbrack, sculptured from a block of marble taken from the French by Sir George Rooke, is seen. Entering through the doorway in the centre of the first building ou our right, a broad staircase conducts to a long gallery, called King Charles's ward. In the Council-room are several paint- ings by Kneller, Lely, Gainsborough, Thornhill, and other celebrated artists. In the Antechamber are two large sea pieces, presented to the Hospital by Philip fiarman, representing the naval exploits of his ancestor, Captain Thomas Harman, in the reign of Charles H.; and six smaller pictures, represent- ing the loss of the Luxembourg gal- ley, which was burnt on her passage from Jamaica to London, in 1727. Captain William Boys, who was one of six survivors of this calamity, was after- wards Lieutenant-governor of the Hos- pital. In King William's Building is tho Painted Hall, a noble naval gallery, the design of Sir Christopher Wren, 106 feet in length, 56 in width, and 50 high. It is lighted on one side by a double range of windows, and is surrounded by a range of lofty Corinthian pilasters supporting a rich entablature. In the vestibule, which is surmounted by one of the two domes conspicuous on the hospital, a collection of dingy, tattered . flags droop, dull, motionless, and dusty, scribe. The fourth, or south-east wing, commonly called Queen Mary's Build ing, contains the chapel. From the river the hospital is seen to advantage, seated on the terrace, which is 875 feet in length. In tho centre is a landing place from the river, from whence the view of this sumptuous pile is strikingly beautiful, extending through a length ened perspective of elegant buildings, enriched by the stately domes of the hall"], [118, "78 sidj walls display the landing of the Prince of Orange at Harwich, and of George I. at Greenwich. Several memo- rials of naval worthies are shown here, such as the moth-eaten coat of Nelson worn at the battle of the Nile, models of ships of wai, (fee. ; or the visitor may refer to some of the old pensioners, who are always near at hand, ready for a trifle to exercise their powers of memory, and several of whom may have been actors in one or other of the great naval engagements represented on canvas. It is but just to add to our brief notice of the paintings in the great hall, that they were principally obtained by the exer- tions of Edward Hawke Locker, Esq. A few yards along the colonnade,which is 347 feet in length, leads to the south-west quarter, where an alto-relievo comme- morates Nelson's 122 battles. An ob- ject that attracts attention is a huge gun, mounted upon a handsome metal car- riage, and pointing its threateniug muzzle across the river. It is a trophy brought by Admiral Duckworth from the Dardanelles in 1891. This gun car- ried marble shot, weighing 150 pounds each, the bore being 14 inches in diame- ter, or 3 feet 6 inches in circumference. On the sides of tho carriage which sup- ports it are the names and dates of vari- ous naval victories, the earliest being \" Camperdown and Duncan, 1794 ; \" the latest, \" St. Jean D'Acre and Stop- ford, 1840.\" Engraved upon the top is a long inscription. The chapel was built by a self-educated architect, James Stuart, whose celebrated work on the \" Antiquities of Athens \" showed the ex- traordinary development of his genius. This chapel is described as the most highly decorated of any modern ecclesi- astical building in this country. In the vestibule aro statue3 of Faith, Hope, Meekuess, and Charity, after designs by West. A flight of fourteen steps leads through folding doors of mahogany, ex- quisitely carved, with an architrave, frieze, and cornice of statuary marble,iuto the chapel, which is 111 feet in length, and 52 in breadth, with a lofty arched ceiling, divided into compartments, and elegantly ornamented with foliage and other designs. Within the entrance is a portico of four fluted columns, of the Ionic order, each formed of one entire block of veined marble, 15 feet high, over the marble statues of the heroes, Nelson, Duncan, St. Vincent, and Howe, whose trophies they were. Here will be seen, also, the model of an antique ship, found in the Villa Mattea, given by Lord Anson. Standing upon the steps the view of the hall, with its ac- cessories of ornament and pictorial walls, is impressive. The ceiling, painted by Sir James Thornhill, was the occupation of nearly six years, and was paid for at the rate of three pounds per yard. It is in compartments; the figures in the centre represent King William and Queen Mary seated on a throne, at- tended by the cardinal virtues, aud sur- rounded with emblematical representa- tions of the seasons, the signs of the zodiac, and numerous allegorical devices from mythology and history. A series of portraits of the most distinguished admirals, together with paintings of their principal naval engagements, deco- rate tho walls ; and over the great arch at the upper end of the hall are the British arms supported by Mars and Minerva. The pictures are arranged some- what chronologically, beginning, at the left-hand corner,with the Armada and the naval heroes of Queen Elizabeth's reign, and ending, on the right-hand side of the entrance, with the bombardment of Algiers by Lord Exmouth, A painting of more than usual interest represents Henry VIII., in the Henri Qrace-a- Dieu, sailing to Calais to meet Franc's I. of France. This was the father of ships, and was the first double-decker that was ever built in England. The visitor should not omit to see a view of the old palace at Greenwich, 1690 (be- fore its endowment as an hospital), and a view of Windsor Castle as it appeared in the same year. Both these paintings, which are highly curious, are by Vors- terman. From the saloon a flight of steps leads into the upper hall, in wliich the funeral car of Lord Nelson is de- posited. The ceiling is decorated with portraits of Queen Anne and Prince George of Denmark, together with va rious emblematical figures, among which Sir Jame3 Thornhill has introduced his own likeness ; in the angles are the arms of England, Scotland, France, and Ire land, between which are represented the four quarters of the world with their several emblems and productions. The"], [119, "79 which support the organ gallery. On each side of the portal are Corinthian pillars of scagliola, with 'bases and capi tals of marble, of which the shafts are 28 feet high; and on each side of the altar are corresponding columns wliich sup port the roof. The painting over the altar is by West ; the subject is the shipwreck of St. Paul at Melita, the Malta of the moderns. Over this is a clever chiar-oscuro of the Ascension ; and surmounting the lower windows are other paintings in the same style. The hospital formerly received about 3,000 naval pensioners of all ranks, but by a recent Act of Parliament out pensions were substituted, and the splendid pile appropriated as a Royal Naval College, having accommodation for 700 students. All officers of the Royal Navy and Marine Artillery and Engineers can be admitted, and a limited number of officers of the Mercantile Marine. The course of study includes the higher branches of mathematics, astronomy, hydrographic surveying, ex perimental sciences, marine engineer ing, naval architecture, fortification, in ternational and maritime law, modern languages, and hygiene. The infirmary is now used by the corporation known as the \"Seamen's Hospital,\" formerly attached to the floating ship \" Dread nought.\" To the south of the hospital is the naval school. This institution is intended for the clothing, maintenance, and education of the children of seamen. It comprises an upper and lower school. The scholars, now numbering about 800, are admitted between the ages of eleven and twelve, and receive a very efficient education from masters appointed for the purpose. The schoolrooms consist of two spacious wings, each 146 feet in length and 42 in breadth, connected with the central building by a colonnade of the Tuscan order, 180 feet long and 20 wide. The central building, formerly the palace of Queen Henrietta Maria, erected in 1635, and considerably en larged for its present purpose, contains apartments for the superintending cap tain, the chaplains, the head master, (fee. In the western wing are the chapel and the upper school room, with a lateral recess, over which are two spacious dor mitories, containing hammocks sus pended in two tiers on each side. To the west of this wing is tllO gym- nasium, with complete appaiatus for the practice of those athletic exercises so essential in a nautical education. In part of the ground is a circle of lofty masts and slighter poles, affording a complete course of gymnastics, peculiarly adapted to naval purposes. Tho east wing comprises the lower school-room, with dormitories and a re- fectory, together with a room for wash- ing. The grounds surrounding the build- ing are pleasantly laid out. A small observatory is attached to the house. The Park, one of the most favourite resorts of the citizens of London, and the scene of many a festive picnic, comprising nearly two hundred aci .s of undulating and wooded land, was laid out by the celebrated Le Notre, in the reign of Charles II. The rows of stately elms and chestnuts were planted by Evelyn. Famous as the park now is, it also wore its holiday garb on many a stately occasion in oldon time, for Greenwich was then specially favoured by royalty. Of the original palace of Greenwich, or as it was when repaired and partly rebudt in the reign of Henry VII., not one stone remains, but for many centuries our monarchs made it their frequent residence ; and it was the birthplace of the bluff Hal, and his daughters Mary and Elizabeth ; here also Edward Vi. died. When Henry VII. willed the coronation of his queen, Elizabeth, she came from Greenwich attended by \" barges freshly furnished with banners and streamers of silk.\" When Henry VIII. avowed his marriage with Anne Boieyn, she was brought by \" all the crafts of London\" from Greenwich to the Tower, \" trum- pets, shawms, and other divers instru- ments all the way playing and making great melody.\" Iu December, 1536, when the Thames was frozen, \" the King's Majesty, with his beautiful spouse, Queen Jane, rode throughout the city of London to Greenwich.\" Queen Elizabeth had a predilection for Green- wich, and made it her favourite resi- dence. Here several councils were also held, at one of which (1559) it was deter- mined that no nuncio from the Pope should enter the realm. From One- Tree Hill, a well-known rendezvous for holiday folks, and the scene of much"], [120, "80 merriment amongst yonng people, a splendid panorama of the river and the neighbourhood is displayed. It is, how ever, from the summit of the hill upon which stands the Observatory, 160 feet above the river, that the greatest variety of prospect can be enjoyed; and this leads us to speak of the building itself, which occupies the site of an old fortified tower, erected in the early part Of the fifteenth century by Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, brother of Henry V. It consists of two buildings, one a low oblong edifice, which is properly the Observatory, and the other a house for the Astronomer Royal. The uppor part of the latter, however, besides serv ing as a library-room, is also fitted with instruments, and there is a camera obscura on the top of tho house. The library contains many scarce and valuable works, principally on scientific subjects. The meridian of this Observatory is cele brated as that whence tho longitude is computed in all British maps and charts. To insure greater accuracy and uni formity in the movement of railway trains, the clocks in all the stations keep Greenwich time. Tbe. chronometers for the navy are all rated here. On the eastern angle of the buildiDg there is a ball of wood, which is raised half-way to tbe top of a pole five minutes before I p.m., and at two minutes before one to the top, from whence at 1 o'clock, mean time, it is dropped, for the purpose of indicating the true time for tbe ship ping, that the commanders may set their chronometers. The town of Greenwich does not possess, in itself, many attrac tions, although various improvements have been made of late years. The streets are narrow, and the houses, with the exception of those recently erected, are mean and irregular. The parish church dedicated to St. Alphage (who was martyred on this spot by the Danes in the commencement of the eleventh century), is a large and massive structure in the mixed Greek style of architecture, with a square tower, above which is a cupola supported on pillars of the Corinthian order, and surmounted by a small spire. The interior contains nothing worthy of particular remark. There are five other churches in Green wich\u2014St. Mary, Trinity, St. Paul's, St. John's and Christ's ; also many dissenting places of worship. Charities are abundant : the most worthy of note are Queen Elizabeth's College, the first public charity after the Reformation, instituted in 1558, for the maintenance of twenty poor men and their wives. The original endowment has been augmented by subsequent bequests, and its revenues are under the management of the Drapers' Company. Trinity Hospital, commonly called Norfolk College, founded by Henry Howard, Earl of Northampton, in 1613, for the relief and support of twelve poor men of the parish of Greenwich, and eight poor men of the parish of Shotsharn, in Norfolk, is endowed with \u00a3660 per annum. One of the noblest charities of Greenwich, it was founded by John Roan, who bequeathed all his posses sions, \"to bring up so many poor town born children of Greenwich at school, that is, to reading, writing and cipher ing, and each of them 40s. per annum towards their clothing, until each of them shall accomplish the age of 15 years.\" Among the free schools is the Grey Coat, endowed in 1643 ; the other charities are the Green Coat, endowed in 1672, for the support and education of the sons of town-bom watermen, sea men, or fishermen of Greenwich. The Blue Coat, National, British, Infant, and Ragged Schools are also well supported. The Jubilee Almshouses receive fifteen inmates, each of whom receives a stipend of \u00a310 per annum.

Greenwich contains many large factories, a rope-yard, iron foundries, iron steamboat works, and engineering esta blishments.

GUILDFORD\u2014 (STATION.) \u2014A parliamentary (returning one member) and municipal borough of West Surrey ; a market town and the capital of the county, beautifully situated on tbe de clivity of a range of chalk hills, on the eastern bank of the Wey, in the hundred of Woking union, county court district, and petty sessional division of Guildford, deanery of Stoke, archdeaconry of Surrey, and diocese of Winchester. It is also a station on the Portsmouth branch of the South Western Railway, and has water communication, by means of the river Wey, with London, Godalming, (fee. Guildford was a royal Saxon \"ville,\" with a palace belonging to the king. It stood by a ford over the river, whose waters were remarkably clear, which caused it to be called Gegldford, or the Golden Ford. Alfred the Great be queathed it, by will, to his nephew Ethelred. Henry II. built a palace here, and the town was the occasional abode of royalty through several succes sive reigns. Two monastic institutions were also founded in the vicinity during the reign of Henry III. The borough returned two members to Parliament from the twenty-third of Edward I. until 1867, when the representation was reduced, and in 1874 it was made the seat of a suffragan bishopric to Win chester. Guildford is a very ancient prescriptive borough, and was considered such in its first known charter, that of Henry III., a.d. 1256. The town was governed by a mayor, recorder, seven magistrates, and an intermediate num ber of bailiffs, which seldom, however, exceeded twenty, by the style and title of \"the mayor and approved men of Guildford,\" who held a court every thre6 weeks, and had the power of trying capital causes. Afterwards the title was changed to that of \" the mayor and burgesses,\" and so continued until the Municipal Act. The corporation have adopted the Public Health Acts. The waterworks were transferred to them a few years sidee. In the reign of George II. an Act was obtained for lighting the town, the power being vested in the cor poration, but the gasworks were erected by a proprietary company in the year 1824. A cemetery is in existence for all the parishes except that of Stoke. Guildford contains twenty three churches, some of them in teresting specimens of antique archi tecture ; nine dissenting and Roman Catholic chapels ; a grammar school, founded by Edward VI., which enjoys a high reputation as a classical seminary ; Archbishop Abbot's school, with twelve trustees for its management ; and several national, British, parochial, and other schools ; the county assize courts, a town hall, police station, corn market, county court office, theatre, dispensary ,the Guild ford institute, the mechanics' institute, the working men's institution, Abbot's hospital, Stoke hospital, &c. The Royal Surrey county hospital, costing \u00a315,000, was opened in 1868. In speaking of public buildings, the first place is, how ever, due to the ancient Castle, apparently of Norman origin ; and although its quadrangular keep is nearly all that now remains, standing boldly on the brow of the hill facing the west, and constructed chiefly of ragstone, flint, and chalk, there are traces of foundations that prove the original building to have covered altogether more than four acres of ground. The tower, together with the gateway, consists of three stories ; but all the floors, together with the roof itself, have long been destroyed, and there is no access to the upper part except by steps or ladder. There are some crypts, also, once forming a part of the castle, that are well worth an examination. The trade of the town and district is chiefly confined to agri culture.

GUSTON\u2014 (Station\u2014 DOVER\u2014 2 miles.) \u2014 A parish and village of the county of Kent (eastern division) ; in Dover union, county court district, and petty sessional division. The newly constructed Dover and Deal railway runs through the parish and has its station at Martin. The church is an interesting structure, which in part dates from the Norman era. Area : 1,041 acres. Popu lation: 728. shire and Wiltshire. Length, 66 miles; breadth. 42 miles ; circumference, 225 miles; square miles, 1,672. The Isle of Wight, which is included in the county, is 22 miles long by 13 broad, with a cir cumference of 56 miles. The principal rivers are the Itche_, Anton, Hainble, Avod, Stour, Exe, and Test. There are also the Andover and Basingstoke canals, and nearly 3,800 miles of roads. The railways belong chiefly to the South Western system. A trunk line from London enters the county on tho north east at Farnborough, passing by Basing stoke and Winchester to Southampton. The South Coast line extends out of Sussex to Portsmouth. A branch of the South Western line extends from Gosport to Salisbury, crossing the main line at Bishopstoke. The Southampton and Dorchester line throws off branches to Lymington, Christchurch and Bourne mouth. There is also a lino from Redbridge to Andover, and from Basing stoke to Salisbury. One from Ash aud Farnham to Winchester passes by Alton, and there is another from Southampton to Netley, and from Bishop's Waltham to Petersfield. Porchester is intersected by a line from Havant to Fareham The direct Portsmouth railway from London runs by Petersfield and Havant. A branch from Reading to Basingstoko connects the Great Western system with the South Western. The South Eastern line from Guildford, via Ash, to Reading, passes Farnborough and Blackwater. In tbe Isle of Wight there is a line from West Cowes to Newport, and another from Ryde to Ventnor. The county has a great variety of soils, but the prin cipal part is chalk ; the Dorsetshire border has large tracts of heath, and towards the sea are great quantities of marsh land, but very fertile ; all the re mainder is excellent land. It is one of the most fertile and populous counties in England. On the downs, of which a ridge runs almost across the country, are fed extensive flocks of sheep. Be sides wheat, barley, and hops, it is famous for bacon, honey, and timber, the last in particular, on account of its great woods, of which the principal are the New Forest, and the Forest of Berc. In the chalk district, Walbury Beacon is 1,011 feet high (the highest chalk in England), Sidon Hill is 942 feet high, H A L S T E A D.-(STATION.)-A village and parish of tho county of Kent (western division); in Sevenoaks union, county court district, and petty sessional division.

Its most contracted title is that of Hants. It is a maritime county, bounded on the north by Berkshire, east by Surrey and Sussex, south by the English Channel, and west by Dorset-"], [123, "83 Butser Hill 917 feet, Beacon Hill 900 feet, aud Portsdown Hill 444 feet. In the Isle of Wight the downs range from 400 to 600 feet high, rising to 845 feet at St. Catherine's Hill, and are accompanied with ironsand, wealden clay, (fee. The scenery of the interior of the island, and of Undercliff at its back, is proverbial for its beauty. Hampshire returns four members to Parliament, two for each division, north and south, and the Isle of Wight also returns one member. It is in the western circuit, the assizes being held at Winchester, and it com prises an archdeaconry in the diocese of Winchester, province of Canterbury. The borough representation comprises Portsmouth, Southampton, and Win chester (city), two members each; Andover, Christchurch, Lymington, Newport (I. of W.),and Petersfield, one member each. The shire has 38 hun dreds, 10 liberties, 351 civil parishes, besides parts of others, 24 poor-law unions, 1 poor-law union under a Local Act, 1 poor-law parish, 26 regis try districts, 9 municipal boroughs [An dover, Basingstoke, Lymington, New port (I. of W.). Portsmouth, Romsey, Ryde (I. of W.) Southampton (county of itself), and Winchester (city)], 22 urban sanitary authorities, 22 rural sanitary authorities, and 20 turnpike trusts. It also has one court of quarter sessions, and is divided into 14 petty sessional divisions, and 17 lieutenancy sub divisions. The boroughs of Andover, Portsmouth, Southampton, and Win chester (city), have commissions of the peace and separate courts of quarter sessions ; the boroughs of Basingstoke, Newport (I. of W.), Romsey, and Ryde (I. of W.), have commissions of the peace only. The boroughs of Basing stoke, Newport (I. of W.), Portsmouth, Ryde (I. of W.), Southampton, and Winchester (city), have their own police. Christchurch is a corporate borough, not subject to the Municipal Corporations Acts. In the extreme north Hampshire consists of the lower eocene strata (Lon don clay, &c.) An extensive tract in the north and centre exhibits chalk and its associated marls. The London clay beds reappear in a kind of belt crossing the county from Havant towards Salisbury. The neighbourhood of Southampton dis plays the Barton and Bagshot series, which also extend round by the New- Forest to Christchurch. The Isle of Wight has the upper eocene beds (fluvio marine) in the north, chalk in the cen tral parts, and the greensands and wealden clay in the south. The geology of this island is peculiarly interesting. Hampshire was a seat of the Belg\u00e6, and was part of Britannia Prima, and of Wessex. The Britons styled it Gwent, i.e. full of downs. In the ninth and teuth centuries tho Danes wasted Hamp shire ; and in the Parliamentary war several battles aud sieges took place here. There are many Roman, monas tic, and castellated antiquities (some of which are in good preservation), as Netley and Beaulieu Abbey, and Por chester, Carisbrook and other castles. The manufactures are of little impor tance, except such as are connected with the ship-building yards at Portsmouth and Northam. Overton has silk mills ; and in a few other places, linseys, drug gets, bombazines, <fec, are made. The making of bank-note paper is carried on at Freefolk, and of watch chains at Christchurch.

HASTINGS.\u2014 (STATION.) \u2014 A parliamentary (returning two members) and municipal borough of East Sussex ; one of the Cinque Ports, a market town, poor-law union of thirteen parishes, .and county court district, in the arch deaconry of Lewes and diocese of Chi chester. It is also the eastern terminus"], [124, "84 of the London Brighton and South Coast Railway. The old town of Hast ings is situated in a valley between two hills, opening to the sea. On the east hills are traces of a Roman encampment, and on the west are the ruins of the castle. The new part of the borough, called St. Leonards, is in a direct line along the shore to the westward. The name of Hastings appears, in conjunc tion with that of \" Pevensea,\" in a charter of King Ossa. The name is probably derived from the tribe of the Hestingii. In the reign of Athelstan, the town possessed a mint, and in that of Edward the Confessor it was incor porated among the Cinque Ports. The Normans landed not far to the west ward, and the famous battle of Hastings took place at Battle, in its vicinity. In 1090 William Rufus took up his abode in Hastings Castle, which had only just been built or restored, and in the same year Battle Abbey was consecrated. In 1360 the town suffered from the French, and lost its importance until it gradually became celebrated as a watering-place. Hastings has been a place of note from very early times. Elizabeth ,-sve the town a charter appointing a m<.jor and twelve jurats. The corporation, as now constituted, is the urban sanitary authority. The borough has a separate court of quarter sessions, and its own police force. A complete system of main drainage has been executed. The waterworks belong to tho town; the supply is chiefly obtained from Artesian and other wells, whence the water is pumped by steam-power to the summit of the hills. The gasworks belong to a company. There is a handsome borough cemetery at Ore, some distance from the town. The ancient castle is tastefully laid out in walks and gardens. There are seven churches, including All Saints' (1068) and St. Clement's (1284). The Independents have built a handsome chapel at St. Leonards. Other denomi nations, including the Baptists, Wes leyans, and Roman Catholics, have places of worship, the last-named having also a college (All Souls'). Other struc tures include the town hall, music hall and assembly rooms, infirmary, dispen sary, and a handsome memorial tower to the late Prince Consort. There is also a handsome pier. The inhabitants are chiefly occupied in providing for the wants of the numerous visitors, Hast ings having long enjoyed the reputation of being one of the most favoured English sea-coast resorts. [Fairlight is situated about two miles north of the town. From this spot, which rises gradually to an elevation of nearly 600 feet, the eye wanders over a fine country of hill and dale, varied with numerous towns ; a wide expanse of the British Channel, extending from Beachy Head to the South Foreland, a distance of eighty miles, and bounded by the cliffs of Boulogne. A descent from the rocks, by several paths, leads to the Dripping Well and to Fairlight Glen, 560 feet above the sea. At the top of the glen is Fairlight Place ; the road branching off to the right leads to the Lovers'-seat, a romantic Bpot, from whence may be seen a glorious view of the bold sweep of the cliffs right away to Dungeness, with masses of undercliff piled over each other in romantic con fusion, aud clothed with brushwood down to the very edge of the sands, while across the sea may occasionally be seen, in clear weather, the dim outline of the French coast. A charming spot is Pett, a small village north of Fair light, four miles and a half from Hast ings. At low water, during the spring tides, the remains of a wood may he seen imbedded in the sands. Gucstling is a village north of Fairlight and Pett. Broomham Park, which skirts the side of the road, is a seat belonging to the Ashburnham family. Mayfic ld, in the parish of Guestling, is the birthplace of Gregory Martin, the translator of the Rheims version of the Bible. Ore is a small parish, two miles north of Hast ings. The church contains a sepulchral brass. Ore Place, a mansion belonging to the Elphinstone family, is situated on the north side of the churchyard. Part of the house is very old. A little on the Hastings side of Ore Rectory, is a path which leads through fields to the Old Roar, a romantic spot, and a fa vourite resort of the artist. Hollington is a small parish north-west of Hastings, chiefly remarkable for the picturesque and secluded situation of its church, which is in the centre of a wood, a quarter of a mile from any habitation. A longer excursion may be made to"], [125, "85 Bodiam Castle (13 miles), a distance which will be slightly increased if, as may easily be done, Brede and Northiam are taken in the way. The return may be by Sedlescombe. Brede is distant from Hastings one mile only, and should be visited, if only to examine the old parish church and its beautiful monuments. Brede Place, of which the great hall, &c, still remain, is now a farm-house. Crowhurst lies between Hollington and Catsfield. Crowhurst Church stands pleasantly in a valley, surrounded by trees. Tho nave was rebuilt 1794. In the tower window are considerable remains of stained glass. Crowhurst was long held by the Pelhams ; aud in the tower door-case, and the tracery of the windows above, occurs the well-known Pelham Buckle, the achievement adopted in memory of the taking of the French King at Poic- tiers, an exploit in which Sir John Pelham assisted. A wooden buckle, probably a part of the old screen, is also nailed to the front of the gallery. In the churchyard is a noble yew of un- known antiquity, twenty-seven feet in circumference at four feet from the ground. South of the church are the remains of an ancient manor-house of late Early English character. It was a small parallelogram with a porch, and contained only threo rooms, a vaulted ground floor, a large room above, and one over the porch, perhaps an ora- tory. The east window of the large room has very good mouldings.] Mar- ket Day : Saturday. Fairs: Whit Tues- day and July 26. Municipal Area : 1,636 acres. Parliamentary Area : 4,617 acres.

HEADCORN.\u2014 (STATION.) \u2014A village and parish of the county of Kent (mid division) ; in Hollingbourne union, and Maidstone county court district and petty sessional division. Headcorn is situated in a valley, which is tradition ally reputed to have been an estuary, or great arm of the sea. Marine shells, chiefly of a small size, are continually being found here. Tbe town is situated on a branch of the Medway, and on the road leading from Maidstone to Tenter den. The church, dedicated to St. Peter and St. Paul, is an ancient struc ture. In tbe churchyard is an oak of extraordinary size, measuring forty feet in circumference. Thero are dissenting places of worship and schools in this village. Hops and fruit are grown here. In this parish, on Mottenden Manor, there was a monastery of Crouched Friars, where \" miracle plays \" are said to have been performed ; this, with one exception \u2014 Boughton Blean \u2014 being the only place in Kent where these extrava gances took place. Near Headcorn is Chart Sutton, and the fine seat and park of the De Bouveries, the house most beautifully situated, overlooking the Weald and its contiguous districts. The neighbourhood, also, is said to have been formerly planted in vineyards, from the produce of which considerable quantities of excellently -flavoured wine were made. Sutton Valence, too, though now an insignificant village, deserves notice as having been the pro perty of the Valences, formerly a power ful baronial family in this district ; and near it are the venerable ivy-mantled ruins of Sutton Castle, which, from the remains of the keep aud walls, appears to have been strongly fortified, and may perhaps have been used as a place of defence for its lords during the wars of the barons.

HERNE BAY.-(Station-STURRY \u2014 5 miles.) \u2014 A watering place and chapelry, in the parish of Herne and county of Kent (eastern division) ; in Blean union and county court district, and Canterbury petty sessional division. This place sprang into existence a few years ago. The town or street stands about the centre of the parish of Herne, and directly faces the North Sea. The church of St. Martin is a handsome building, consisting of a nave, two aisles, and three chancels, with a square tower. It is partly in the Early English and partly in the Perpendicular style, and was restored in 1854. Several curious tombs and brasses may be seen here. The chapel-of-ease to tho mother church is a neat Gothic building. There are places of worship for Nonconformists and assembly rooms for visitors. Pro minent objects in the town are the clock house or tower, erected on the parade at a cost of \u00a34,000 by Mrs. Thwaites, and the pier (opened by the Lord Mayor ot London, Sir Sydney H. Waterlow, Bart., in 1873). The former is 75 feet high, and forms an excellent land mark by night as well as by day, the faces of the clock being illuminated. The parade extends nearly the whole length of the town, which is governed by Improve ment Commissioners.

The village is aucient, a church haviug existed here before the Norman Conquest. A nun nery was established here by King Stephen. An ancient causeway leads across the marshes to the Thames, over which there was formerly a ferry. Near the station is a barrow. The church is venerable, and contains a piscina, a large aud ancient altar tomb, some curious tiles and a font. Over the communion table is placed a tablet in commemoration of Sir Francis Head, Bart., who resided on his estate, called the Hermitage, in this parish, and died there in 176S. Gad's Hill, on tho Rochester-road, celebrated by Shakespeare as the spot where Prince Henry and Falstaff robbed travellers, is in the south-western part of this parish. There is a comfortable inn at this place, with a characteristic portrait of Falstaff on one side, and Prince Hal on the other. Here long resided our great novelist Charles Dickens, to whom all who read the English language are indebted. Three miles from Higham Station is Cowling Castle, said to be so named from its cold, bleak situation. It was originally a square building, flanked by towers, surrounded by a moat, and having at a short distance a detached gateway for the principal entrance. At the south-east angle are the remains of a circular tower, picturesquely clothed with ivy ; but the rest of the building, with the exception of the gateway, is little more than a heap of ruins. The gateway is a very bold and handsome structure, consisting of an arched entrance, flanked by two large semicircular towers, embattled and machicolated. The groove of the port cullis is still visible. There was an ascent by a flight of stone steps within each tower, to their roofs. On the front Bay is considered by some authorities to"], [127, "87 of the eastern tower is affixed a tablet of brass, in the form of a deed or grant, with Lord Cobham's seal of arms de- pending, and bears an inscription in ancient characters. According to tradi- tion, the founder, John, Lord Cobham, temp. Richardll., 1310, was apprehensive that the strength of his castle might give umbrage at court, and therefore set up this inscription to vouch for the purity of his intentions. Sir George Brooke, Lord Cobham, in the reign of Mary, successfully defended this castle against his grandson, Sir Thomas Wyatt. The village of Cowling is small. The church is ancient.

HUNDRED OF HOO.\u2014 This \u2022district is mainly comprised in tbe tongue of marsh land which stretches from Higham and Strood between the Thames and Medway channels. That portion of it which faces the North Sea opposite Sheerness is known as the Isle of Grain ; it is a parish in the mid division of Kent ; the marshes and a wide creek once rendered the parish a perfect island, but it is now connected by road with Rochester, some twelve miles distant, which place only affords land communication with the parish. From Sheerness the Medway has to be crossed by boat, which in rough weather is an unpleasant journey. The north- east corner of the island is strongly for- tified, the earthworks enclosing barracks for 300 artillerymen. Huge guns command the entrance to both the Med- way and the Thames. Almost in a line due north with the fort, is stationed the Nore lightship, a well-known beacon for mariners. The church \u2014 St. James's \u2014 is very ancient, the arch dividing the chancel and the nave displaying traces of Saxon architecture, and the pews bearing date 1645. The monastery at Minster formerly held sway over the church. [A new railway from Higham to Port Vic toria, a point between Queenborough and Sheerness, but on the north side of the Medway, is now in course of construction. There will be a deep-sea pier at the port, from which there will eventually be a direct steam-boat service to Belgium, Holland, and Germany.] Area : 3,156 acres (much of it marsh land).

HYTHE.\u2014 (STATION.)\u2014 A parlia- mentary (returning one member con- jointly with Folkestone and Sandgate) and municipal borough of East Kent, a seaport and one of the Cinque Ports, market town, parish, and bathing place, situated on the south coast of Kent, at the foot of a steep hill, in the union of Elham, huudred and county court dis- trict of Hythe, lathe of Shepway, deanery of Elham, and archdeaconry and diocese of Canterbury, 7 1 miles from London by road, 20 from Canterbury, and 5 from Folkestone. Hythe is a corruption of \"Have\" or \"Haven\" derived from its harbour. It would appear that there was originally a very ancient port, called \"Limene\" which became choked with sand, and from whence the inhabitants removed to West Hythe; this place also shared a similar fate, and the present town of Hythe rose into importance Until the sand tilled its harbour to such an extent that it can now only be approached by small fishing boats. That it was at one period a place of con- sequence, and had a good harbour, is proved by the circumstance of its having been made one of the Cinque Ports, and furnishing five ships, with twenty men and a boy to each, for the Royal Navy. In a crypt under the church is a mass of human bones, said to be those of Britons who were slain in a battle with the Saxons in 845, and in the neighbourhood are the remains of Saltwood Castle. The town was incorporated by Queen Elizabeth, with a mayor and jurats, and was governed under her charter until the passing of the Municipal Act. It has a commission of the peace, with a recorder, magistrates, and a police force, and holds quarter sessions, and petty sessions fort- 8"], [128, "88 j longing to a company. The burial board is not connected with the corporation. | The parish church of St. Leonard's is a nightly. An Act was passed in the 38th year of the reign of George III., whereby commissioners, now represented by the members of the town council, are ap pointed for paving, lighting, (fee. The waterworks are the property of the cor poration. There are also gasworks be- Norm an structure, with atower that forms a landmark for mariners. The other public buildings include Wesleyan , Indepen dent, and Primitive Methodist chapels; a"], [129, "89 guildhall and market house, rebuilt by the corporation in 1794, a gaol, barracks for 300 men, the royal school of musketry, a literary institute, a public library and newsroom ; a dispensary, and baths, with waiting rooms, built by the corporation in 1854 at a cost of \u00a32,000. Among the charities are \u2014 St. Bartholomew's hos- pital, founded in 1318 for five brothers and eight sisters ; St. John's hospital, founded in 1570, for two men and seven women; and a few others. The national schools are supported by voluntary contributions. Hythe depends for its trading prosperity upon the School of Musketry, where there are constantly members of the army and of the volun- teer corps, learning the use of the rifle ; and upon the influx of visitors in the summer, who resort to the town for bathiiig. The reputation of the town for sanitary purity is very high. There are also some fishing boats belonging to the place, and a few colliers unload here. Market Days : Thursdays and Saturdays.

KENT (County ol).\u2014 Kent is a maritime county, bounded on the north by the Thames and German Ocean, east and south-east by the latter and the Straits of Dover, south by Sussex, and west by Surrey, and having on its east and south coasts the North and South Forelands and Dungeness. Length, 67 mdes ; breadth, 35 miles ; circumference, 190 miles ; square miles, 1,627. Watered by the Stour, Medway, Darent and other rivers. The Medway is the noblest feeder of the Thames, and has a total length of sixty miles, forty of which are navigable. Lime-burning is carried on upon the Lower Medway ; on the upper streams, the paper trade, to which it is navigated by steam. Ships and large vessels get up to Rochester bridge. The Dour River is a very trifling stream, but it received its present name from the Britons, signify- ing \" water,\" and was known also to the Romans as the Durius. It gives name to Dover, in the valley of which it anciently formed the haven, now built upon and carried out seaward. The river Rother rises in Sussex ; it is navigable on its entry into Kent, and was anciently called by the Britons and Romans the Limene, entering the sea at New Romney. In the time of Ed- ward I. it deserted its channel, and formed a new one by Rye and Winchel- sea. The principal canal is the Royal Military Canal,running along the borders of Romney Marsh from the P^other to Hythe, very little above the level of the sea. The Gravesend and Rochester Canal has been partly used for the North Kent Railway, but its basins and the portions from Gravesend to Higham still remain. The county is intersected by nearly 4,400 miles of roads, and the railway communi- cation is effected by the lines belonging to the South Eastern, and London Chatham and Dover Railway Companies. On that part of the coast bounding the estuary of the Thames, there are num- erous examples both of the gain and loss of land by the sea. Off tbe east shore lie the well-known Goodwin Sands, between which and the mainland is the equally weD-known roadstead called the Downs. Kent may be designated a hilly country, being divided by two"], [130, "90 nearly parallel chains of chalk hills, which traverse the county west to east, terminating in lofty chalk cliffs at Dover, Folkestone and Hythe. The climate of Kent is in general mild and genial. The soil may be divided into the gravel, chalk and clay, which pro duce, where they mix in due proportion, an extremely fertile loam. The alluvial soils along the Thames and Medway7, and in Romney Marsh, produce some of the richest pastures in the kingdom. The gardening of the county was much improved by the Netherland refugees in the sixteenth century. The woods iu Kent arc extensive, and produce much oak, beech, hop-poles, billet-wood, hoops and bark, besides timber for ships and house-building. The lathe of Sutton-at- Hone is a great fruit district, and the valley of the Medway is famous for hops, and the hopping season is as joyous here as the vintage is elsewhere. Building stone is quarried in the chalk, and the ragstone of the Weald. Fa versham, Milton and Whitstable are celebrated for their oysters. The county returns two members for the east division, two for the mid, and two for the west. It is in the South-eastern circuit, the assizes being held at Maid stone, and it constitutes the archdeacon ries of Canterbury and Rochester, in those dioceses, province of Canterbury. The borough representation comprises Canterbury (city), Dover, Greenwich (metropolitan borough), Maidstone, Rochester (city), and Sandwich, two members each, Chatham, Gravesend, and Hythe, one member each. The shire has 5 lathes and 61 hundreds, and comprises the barony of Bircholt, the lowery of Tunbridge, the liberty of the Isle of Sheppey, the liberty of New Romney, 437 civil parishes, besides parts of others, 25 poor-law unions (exclusive of the Metropolis), 1 poor-law district under a special Act (Canterbury), 3 poor-law unions within the Metropoli tan district (Greenwich, Lewisham and Woolwich), 29 registry districts, 12 municipal boroughs [Canterbury (city and county of itself), Deal, Dover, Faversham, Folkestone, Gravesend, Hythe, Maidstone, Margate, Rochester (city), Sandwich, and Tenterden], 34 urban sanitary authorities, 25 rural sanitary authorities, -and- 22 turnpike trusts. It also has one court of quarter sessions, and is divided into 16 petty sessional divisions and 17 lieutenancy sub-divisions. All the boroughs above named have commissions of the peace and separate courts of quarter sessions, and their own police. The liberty of Romney Marsh has petty and general sessions,and theancient borough of Queeu- borough has a court of quarter sessions distinct from the county. Dover, Hythe, New Romney, and Sandwich are cinque ports, aud Deal, Faversham, Folkestone, and Margate are corporate members of one or other of them. Fordwich (corporate member of the cinquo port of Sandwich), Lydd (corporate member of the cinque port of New Romney), and New Romney are governed under old charters and not amenable to the Municipal Corporations Act, 1835. The Cinque Ports' justices exercise jurisdiction in and for tbe Deal Division of the liberties of the Cinque Ports (comprising the parishes of Ringwould and Walmer and the hamlet of Kingsdown), and the parish and town of Ramsgate. The towns of Ramsgate and Tunbridge Wells main- tain police establishments separate from the county. A considerable portion of the county is included in the Metro- politan Police, Central Criminal Court, Metropolitan Board of Works and London School Board jurisdiction. Chalk and greensand prevail in tbe hills, and cla.y mixed with gravel, sand or loam in the more level tracts. Kent is first distinctly noticed by the name of Cantium, doubtless a Latinization of the ancient British appellation of the same territory. By the Saxons it was called at first Kant-wara-rike , meaning the \" Kentish men's country.\" The present name is an evident derivation of the first word of the Saxon compound. In the earliest times of English history the \"men of Kent \" showed themselves true to their orifiin, and were looked upon as the stay of our naval power. Hence the establishment of the Cinque Ports, endowed with exclusive and valuable privileges, and which, down to the seventeenth century, supplied the greater part of the shipping and 3eamen to our fleet. It remains at the present time in the possession of the chief of our naval arsenals, and contains many important establishments. Julius C\u00e6sar"], [131, "91 landed here, and Kent has been the seat of many sanguinary conflicts. William the Conqueror burnt Romney and Dover, but confirmed the men of Kent in their privileges. These are chiefly comprised in gavelkind (from the Saxon Gafel, signifying a rent or acknowledgment in money or in kind, and Gafelkind lands, those for which a rent was paid, or, in other words, lands held by socage tenure, in contradistinction to those which were held by military service), or the suc cession of all the sons, or brothers, and nephews to landed property, and the right of non-forfeiture of lands, except for treason. The year 1170 is memorable for the return of Thomas a Becket from his long exile, and still more so for his murder at Canterbury ; nor is the year 1172 les3 remarkable for the voluntary penance which Henry II. underwent at his tomb. ln 1381 the insurrection under Wat Tyler commenced at Dart ford, and the insurgents encamped on Blackheath, whence they proceeded to London. In 1450, also, the rebels under Jack Cade encamped upon Blackheath, and ou the same heath, in the February following, a great number of his par tisans craved pardon of the king upon their knees. In 1459 four thousand French troops landed on the coast, and burned the town of Sandwich. The year 1 677 i3 memorable in Kentish annals for the daring attack made by a part of the Dutch fleet on the shipping in the Medway. In Decembsr, 1688, the fugi tive King James II. was seized at Sheer ness and conveyed to Faversham. The Emperor Charles V. landed at Dover from Corunna, May 16, 1520, on a visit to Henry VIII. Charles II. landed at the same place, May 26, 1660, on his return from exile. The manufacturing industries of Kent include the making of bricks, tiles, pottery, cement, and lime, in which several thousand people are engaged, paper, gunpowder (Dartford, Erith, Tunbridge, and Faversham), sugar-moulds, tobacco-pipes, hop-bags, sacks, copperas, sugar refining, tar, whiting, and Tunbridge ware. There are also considerable ship-building and marine-engine yards, iron foundries, breweries, maltings, and tanneries. The chief seats of manufacture are Greenwich, Deptsord, Dartford, Maidstone, North fleet, and Faversham. The Cinque Ports figure conspicuously in English history. In the time of the Emperor Diocletian, the Romans placed that part of the British coast nearest the Continent under an officer called the \" Count of the Sea Coast,\" whose duty it was to protect it from invasion. In imitation of this, Edward tbe Confessor constituted the five ports of Dover, Hastings, Hythe, Romney and Sandwich, a body cor porate, under the government of a portreeve or warden, who also hold tho office of Constable of Dover Castle, and they afterwards became designated as \" The Cinque Ports ; \" to these were added in early times the ancient towns of Winchelsea and Rye, to which all the privileges of the Cinque Ports were given. They had a peculiar jurisdiction, separate from that of the county, and were obliged to furnish ships and forces in war time, but, in return, were exempted from pecuniary subsidies, and had other im munities, one of which was that they could not be sued in any but their own towns ; the warden was also permitted to rank as an admiral. William the Conqueror, however, first gave the Cinque Ports an independent jurisdic tion ; by him they were created into a palatinate, with a lord warden, who was invested with civil and military authority, the chief seat of his adminis tration being Dover Castle. Each of the five ports had its own corporation of twelve jurats, from whom the mayor and bailiff were chosen. Formerly there were several courts exercising a general jurisdiction over the ports, and their members, extending from Birchington, near Margate, to Seaford, in Sussex, that of Shepway being the supreme court. The lord warden was the president, tho other members being tbe several mayors and bailiffs, and a certain number of jurats from each town. The Court of Brotherhood and the Court of Guestling were in some respects to be compared with the Imperial Parliament, and it is believed that they were the models on which the latter was originally estab lished. The Court of Lodemanage licensed and regulated the pilots. These courts are now only mere forms. In tho 6th year of his reign, Edward I. gave the oldest charter now on record ; it is 99 years older than the first charter of the City of London. It states that the"], [132, "92 alternate Mondays (cattle) \u2014 December 4. Sittingbourne : Fridays \u2014 third and fifth Tuesday in month (cattle).

This place is celebrated for a clump of remarkable old trees known as the \" Knockholt Beeches,\" which are on a hill 770 feet above the level of the sea, and distinguishable for many miles. H undreds of excursionists visit the neigh bourhood in the course of the summer. Area: 1,700 acres. Population: 676. LADYWELL\u2014 (STATION.) - A district of the parish of Lewisham, in the county of Kent. The station is the first beyond Lewisham, on the Addis combe Road Branch Line. Lewisham Cemetery is close to the station and railway. Average Train Service: Tweuty each way on week days ; six each way ou Sundays. The Fares from the London terminii are small. king had seen the charter granted by his predecessors, William I. and Edward the Confessor. In the 18th year of tho reign of the same monarch, each of the ports returned two \" barons \" or members to Parliament. Charles II. gave the Cinque Ports their last charter in the 20th year of his reign. Until the revolution of 1688 the lord warden exercised the right of nominating one, and sometimes both the members of Parliament for each port ; a special Act abolished this pri vilege in 1689. The Parliamentary Reform Act of 1832 and the Municipal Act of 1835 broke up to a great extent the peculiar political and municipal organization of the Cinque Ports, and their local government has been assimi lated to other towns. By the 1st sec. of 51 Geo. III., cap. 36, the magistrates of the Cinque Ports (who are appointed by the Lord Warden) are empowered to act in such of the liberties of the Cinque Ports as have not separate commissions of the peace. They now exercise their fuuctions in Ringwould, Walmer, and Ramsgate. Area of county, 1,004,984 acres ; number of bouses (1871), in habited, 151,314 ; ditto, uninhabited, 10,850 ; ditto, building, 1,253 ; popula tion (1871), males, 417,506; females, 430,788 ; total, 848,294; average number of persons to an acre, 084 ; ditto acres to a person, 1-18 ; number of parlia mentary electors in 1880 (excluding boroughs) \u2014 east division, 13,169 ; mid division, 8,763; west division, 14,873.

The jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court and the Metropolitan Police in clude Lee. There are five churches (all built since 1840) and several Noncon formist chapels. The district is much favoured for residential purposes. The railway crosses a very pretty park called \" the Cedars ; \" it surrounds a plain stone mansion and encloses an orna mental lake. The Merchant Taylors' Company have almshouses here. Tho public hall adjoins tho station. Area: 1,234 acre3. Population : 10,493. Tho Train Service is very frequent, and the fares from the London termiuii small. LEEDS CASTLE.\u2014 (Stations\u2014 MAIDSTONE or HEADCORN \u2014 6 miles.) \u2014 The village of Leed3 is in tho mid division of the county of Kent, Hollingbourne uuion and Maidstone county court district and Lathe of Aylesford petty sessional division. It is renowned for its magnificent castle,"], [133, "93 presents very attractive features to the notice of the tourist. Among the curio sities which are displayed in great abun dance in the principal apartments, the visitor should not forget to remark the chest and keys that once belonged to the unfortunate Anne Boieyn. A remark ably handsome bedstead, a relic of old times, is also shown. The park is very extensive, and is pleasingly diversified with woodland scenery. The view of the castle from the grounds is remarkably fine. Many of the trees are of great size and beauty. About three-quarters of a mile westward, from the castle, and in the parish of Leeds stood Leeds Abbey, founded in the reign of Henry I., for Augustine canons. This monastery was a very extensive building, and the church was of great size and beauty ; but of the former there are only a few remains, and none whatever exist of the abbey church. Area of Leeds parish : 1,643 acres. Popu lation: 711. the seat of the Wykeham-Martins, which is in the parish of Broomfield. This romantic structure is built entirely of stone, principally in the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries, and in different styles of architecture. Leeds Castle was given by William the Conqueror to his brother, Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, on whose dis grace it was granted to De Crevequer, by whose family it was presented to Edward II., who gave it to Bartholomew, Baron of Badilsmer, who treacherously fortified it against the King, and in 1321 refused a night's rest to Isabel the queen. Leeds Castle was visited by Richard II. In the reign of Henry V., Joan of Navarre, the second queen of Henry IV., being accused of joining a conspiracy against the life of her step-son, was sent a prisoner to this castle. In the reign of Henry VI., Archbishop Chicheley presided here at tbe trial of the Duchess of Gloucester, in 1440. This unfortunate lady was charged with sorcery and witch craft ; she was found guilty and sentenced to three days' penance in London, and committed to perpetual imprisonment in the Isle of Man. In 1359, great improve ments were made by William of Wyke ham ; and in 1822, a part was rebuilt. In 1778, George III. and his queen lodged here, after reviewing the camp at Coxheath. The castle is situated in a beautiful park, surrounded with a large moat of running water, which rises at Lenham and empties itself into the Medway. The site of the castle is rather low in respect to the grounds to the south and east, but to the north-west it commands an extensive panorama. The keep, which has an imposing appearance on approaching the castle from the east, consists of the remains of towers, once of impregnable strength, connected by an armed and covered archway with the rest of the castle, from which it is other wise separated by the water of the moat. In whatever point of view the castle is regarded, the most picturesque combina tions are visible; the great lines are finely broken, the masses boldly pro jected, the colours chastely blended, and in many places beautifully relieved by groups of ash and other trees, which cluster round the older and more de cayed towers ; and the picture is finished by an amphitheatre of umbrageous hills. Tho interior of this stately mansion LEWISHAM.\u2014 (STATION.) \u2014 A parish and suburb of the metropolis, in the county of Kent (western division) ; in Lewisham union, and Greenwich county court and police court districts. The jurisdictions of the Central Criminal Court aud the Metropolitan Police in clude Lewisham. The station is situated on the slope of an eminence amidst picturesque scenery, beautiful green meadows rising abruptly to the summit of the hill on the left, dotted with hand some residences and gardens, while the common is seen intersected by various cross roads and studded with houses on the low ground or valley to the right. Lewisham is a populous parish, Syden ham being a chapelry in the district. The parish church, dedicated to St. Mary, has a square tower at the western end ; there are also two district churches and several dissenting chapels. Among the charities are the Free Grammar Schools, founded in 1652 by the Rev. Abraham Colfe, with seven exhibitions of \u00a310 each to either of the Universities. Lewisham consists principally of a long street ex tending about two miles on the Tun bridge Road. Rushey Green and Cock shed, on the road to Bromley, Perry Hill and Perry Slough, Catford Bridge, and Southend, a rising neighbourhood, are in the immediate vicinity. Area: 5,72*5 acres. Population: 36,')25. The Train"], [134, "94 Service is very frequent, and the Fares from the London terminii small. 11,788 acres of land and 1,715 of water. Population: 1,936. LYMINGE \u2014 (Station\u2014WESTEN HANGER or HYTHE\u2014 4 miles.)\u2014 A village and parish of the county of Kent (eastern division) ; in Elham union and petty sessional division, and Hythe county court district. The village of Lyminge is situated in a most secluded and picturesque district. It is sheltered by two ranges of high ground in the valley ofthe Lesser Stour, which from its source at the southern extremity of the village winds northward, and joins the Greater Stour near Canterbury. To the south the valley opens to the sea between Hythe and Folkestone. Stone Street, the road of the fourth iter of Antonius from Durovernum (Canterbury) to- Portus Lemanis (Lympne) runs in a straight line for about twelve miles from Canterbury, and then towards the ridge of the elevated ground which faces the sea, divaricates on the right to Lympne, and on the left to Lyminge. From the \" Via Limenaea,\" a word whose root is most probably British, its name is derived, but its connection with the ancient haven failed to give it either the interest or the celebrity which it acquired from its becoming tho resting-place of Queen \u00c6thelburga (or \u00c6adburg), who passed the years of her widowed life (633-647) in the nunnery she founded at Lyminge in the former of these years. Of the occasion of this foundation, Goscelinus (who wrote about 1090) gives this description. \" In the church of Lyminge, which belongs to the Arch bishop, the Queen \u00c6thelburga is known tobeburied,but she is there vulgarly called \u00c6adburg.\" (Tbe dedication of the present church is to St. Mary and St. \u00c6adburg.) \" For we know from historians and chronicles that \u00c6thel burga was given in marriage to Edwin, King of Northumberland, and after the death of the King she returned and lived at Lyminge, and took the sacred veil from the blessed Honorius there ; and there (a.d. 647) she died and was buried in the ides of December, and she, as we gather from the opinion of primitive antiquity, through the death of King Edwin and by the favour of her brother Eadbald, first founded and upraised the temple of Lyminge, and hath obtained there the chief name, and that singular LONDON BRIDGE\u2014(STA TION.) \u2014 Originally the metropolitan terminus of the South Eastern Railway. (For particulars see page xiii.) LYDD and DUNGENESS (Stations\u2014APPLE DORE or HYTHE\u2014 7 miles.) \u2014 A small town and parish of the county of Kent (eastern division) ; in Romney Marsh union and petty sessional division and New Romney county court district. Lydd, anciently called Holydean, is an appanage of the Cinque Port of New Romney, and the charters of tho ports apply within its boundary. The cor porate body is composed of a bailiff and twelve jurats (or fewer), who are magis trates for the town by virtue of their office. They have power to hold a court of sessions and gaol delivery, but all criminals are tried by the county justices under 5 George IV., chap. 85. The church of All Saints is a fine building, with a chancel, nave, and lofty tower ; it contains several memorial brasses dating from the thirteenth century, and the tower is reputed to have been built by Cardinal Wolsey when vicar of the parish. The town is situated at the heads of a number of nariow tongues of marsh land which go by the names of Rype and Midrips. The well-known promontory of Dungeness is in the parish of Lydd, but. the lighthouse is nearly four miles from the town. It was erected at the sole expense of the late Earl of Leicester, from the designs of the late Mr. Wyatt, and it is now fitted with the electric light. Dungeness is the nearest point on the English coast to France, the distance to Cape Grisnez being veiy little over twenty statute miles ; and it is not unlikely that it will be utilised before long as a new packet station for the Continent. The depth of water on both sides of the point is so great that large vessels occasionally \" stand in \" to the land sufficiently close for tbe voices of their crews to be distinguished. Not the least advantage involved in the pro bable selection of the \" Ness,\" as the place of departure for \" the shortest passage \" across the dreaded straits, is the shelter it affords on its eastern side from the south-west gales. A branch line is now in course of construction from Appledore to Dungeness. Area :"], [135, "95 monument which exists in the north east aisle (Porticus) of the church against the south wall covered with an arch.' ' Tho site of this venerable burial-place, and the foundations of the north chancel of Ethelburga's Church are still to be seen, whde the charters of endowment of her foundation present fourteen of the earliest documents of the Anglo- Saxon chartulary. That of Coenulf (in S04) speaks of Lyminge as \"the place where rests the body of St. \u00c6adburg.\" Of the fabric itself it may be observed that a portion of the south wall of the nave is a relic of Ethelburga's founda tion, while tbe walls of the chancel and a part of the south wall of the nave belong to tho rebuilding of the church, which from documentary evidence is known to have been carried on between 9G5 and 1085, in which latter year Lanfranc, who had selected Lyminge as one of his manorial residences, trans lated the body of \u00c6thelburga to his newly founded college of regular Canons of St. Gregory's in Canterbury. The north aisle was added about 1400 to the original structure, the arcade being apparently the work of Cardinal Bourchier, whose arms were anciently in one of the windows bchiud it. The tower is the work of the primacies of Cardinal Morton and Archbishop Warham, whose arms are on either side of the western doorway. The whole of the more ancient portion of the walls is built in irregular herring-bone work, with occasional bonding courses of Roman bricks and flat stones, in rude imitation (apparently) of the earlier church, and without any attempt to free them from the masses of concrete in which they were embedded. Three small windows in the chancel, and one in the nave, the arches of which are turned with Roman brick, together with a recess in the south wall formed of the same material, represent the simple features of the church which succeeded the foundation of the Queen, aud in which there can be little doubt that Lanfranc himself, during his residence at Lyminge, officiated. It was at Lyminge, in the year 1279, that Archbishop Peckham hell his first homage, when Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, appeared at his court, and the reconciliation between the Archbishop and that great feudatory was effected, Here, also, the Royal Commission sate on the occasion of the Attainder of Archbishop Arundel which was so soon reversed. Area : 4,620 acres. Population : 1,025. LYMPNE. \u2014 (Stations \u2014 HYTHE orWESTENHANGER\u2014 2 miles.)\u2014 A small village and parish of the county of Kent (eastern division) ; in Elham union and petty sessional division, and Hythe county court district. Lympne is most remarkable for its fine old church and castle and the ruir s of the Roman fortress of StudfaiL The house to the west of the church, popu larly known as the Castle, is a fine speci men of domestic architecture of the time of Henry V., and was a residential mansion of the Archdeacon of Canter bury. The church contains much Norman architecture, and the facing stones of the Studfall castrum were largely used in the work ; it is dedicated to St. Stephen, and has a chancel, nave, and north aisle, with a square tower and five bells. The building was thoroughly restored in 1878, and will, from its great antiquity and interesting associations, amply repay an inspection. From the top of the castle a splendid view of the coast and Romney Marsh is to be obtained. Leland's description of Lympne clearly substantiates the former importance of the place. The following is that painstaking antiquary's account of it : \u2014 \" Lymme hille, or Lyme, was sumtyme a famose haven, and good for shyppes that myght cum to the foote of the hille. The place ys yet cawled Shypway (the name of the Cinque Ports Supreme Court \u2014 see page 59) and Old Haven. Farther at this day the lord of the Vportes (Cinque Ports) kepeth his principal cowrt a lytle by est fro Lymme hill. Ther remayneth at this day the ruines of a strong fortresse (Studfall) of the Britons hanging on the hil, and commynge down to the very fote. The cumpasse of the fortress seemith to be a x acres, and be likelyhood yt had sum wallo, beside that streeched up to the very top of the hille, wher now is the paroch chirche and the archidiacan's howse of Canterbury. The old walles of the castel made of Briton's brikes, very large, and great flynt set togyther almost indossolubely with morters, macle of small pybble. The walles bo very"], [136, "96 thikke, and yn the west end of the castel appereth the base of an old towre. About this castel, yn time of mind, were fownd antiquities of many of the Romeynes. Ther, as the cbirch is now, was sumtyme, without payle, an abbay. The graves yet appere yn the chirch, and, of the lodgings of the abbay, be now converted ynto the archidiacon's howse, the which ys made lyke a castelet embatelyd (the present castle). Ther went from Lymme to Canterbury a streate fayr paved, whereof at this day yt is cawled Stony streat. Yt is the straitest that ever I sawe, and towards Canterbury ward, the pavement con- in that time, that\u2014 with the exception of a few particulars \u2014 it fairly accords with what will meet the visitora' gaze at this day. A winding flight of steps, and a rough trackway a little to the west of the church, load to the foot of the cliff which bounds the village, and thence a footpath by the side of a streamlet con ducts, through a field, to the north side of the remains of the Roman fortress of Studfall. In 1850 the site was excavated by Mr. Charles Roach Smith, F.S.A., and tho course of its walls and tower traced. It was of a hexagonal form, and covered a space of more than ten acres. The few inscriptions which were LYMPNE CASTLE AND CHUECH. tinually appereth a iiii or v myles. Ther cummeth at this day through Lymme castle, a little rylle and other pretty waters resort to the place abowt Lymme hil ; but wher the ryver Lymne showld be, I cannot tel, except yt showldbe that that cometh above Apple dore, iii myles of, and thut ys cours now ys chaunged, and renneth a nerer way ynto the se, by the encresing of Rumeney Marsch, that was sumtyme at se. The old castel of Lyme belonged to Rich. Knight, of Hyne, late decesed.\" Although three centuries have come and gone since the foregoing description was written, so little has Lympne changed discovered point to the fortress having been garrisoned by that section of the Roman military force which served under the designation of Classiarii Britannici \u2014 \" British classiarii or marines.\" A mutilated altar bore an inscription signifying that it had been erected in honour of some deity by \" Baufidius Pantera, Prefect of the British Fleet.\" A variety of coins was also found, but they were of earlier date than the third century. It has thus been impossible to do moro than guess at the period of the erection of tho castrum, which seems to chiefly owe its destruction to several serious landslips."], [137, "97 The insignificant hamlet of Court-at- Street, some two miles north-we3t of Lympne, derives its name from the Via Strata (or Stony Street) of the Romans, which led from Canterbury to Studfall Castle. The remote antiquity of this roadway (see Leland's description before mentioned) is vouched for by the fact that it forms the boundary line of several parishes. The small chapel in ruins, below the brow of the hill, was the scene of the religious impostures of the so called \" Holy Maid of Kent,\" in the reign oE Henry VIII., and which arose out of his projected marriage with Anne Boieyn. MAIDSTONE.\u2014 (Two Stations\u2014 MAIDSTONE TOWN and MAID STONE BARRACKS.)\u2014 Maidstone is a parliamentary (returning two members) and municipal borough of Mid Kent; a market and assize town, parish and poor law union in the hundred of Maidstone and lathe of Aylesford, deanery of Sutton, archdeaconry of Maidstone, and diocese of Canterbury. Tho London Chatham and Dover Company's station here is a terminal one. Thetownis43 miles from Londou by the Stroocl and Maidstone branch of the North K ent Railway , with a continuation of that line joining it to the main line Paddock Wood. It has water communication with other places by means of the Medway. The quarter sessions for the western division of the county are held here. Maidstone possesses con siderable antiquity, having been a town prior to the arrival of the Romans, and ranking third in importance amongst the cities of ancient Britain, under the name of Caer Medway. By the Romans it wa3 called Vagniac\u00e6, and afterwards Madus, and was one of their principal stations in this part of the country. Under the Saxons it went by the name of Med wegston, and in the Domesday Book appears as Maddeston, since then cor rupted into its modern name. During the Norman and Plantagenet eras it was one of the possessions of the see of Canterbury, and remained so until the reign of Henry VIII., when rt was trans ferred to the crown by Archbishop Cranmer, and was bestowed by Edward VI. on Sir Thomas Wyatt, who held it \u25a0until his attainder for rebellion, when it again fell to the crown, and was after wards granted to the Romney family. The Archbishops of Canterbury bestowed many favours on the town. Ufford built a palace here in 1318. A college, dedi- cated to all Saints, was erected iu 1260, rebuilt about 1390, and suppressed in 1538. In 1244 a hospital was built for the benefit of pilgrims passing through the town on their way to the shrine of St. Thomas a Becket at Canterbury ; the chapel of this building still exists, having been restored in 1839 and re-constructed as St. Peter's church. There was also a Franciscan monastery, and a house of the fraternity of Corpus Christi, which were suppressed at the dissolution of monas- teries. In Queen Mary's reign Maidstone figures as the place where the insurrection, headed by Sir Thomas Wyatt, of Ailing- ton Castle, lord of the manor, broke out, in opposition to the marriage of tho queen with Philip of Spain, ln the par- liamentary wars, the burgesses espoused the royal cause, and several Kentish gentlemen posted themselves in the town to hold it for the king, making every house a fortress. In 1648 Fairfax at- tacked it with an army of 10,000 men and with great difficulty succeeded in taking it. Maidstone has sent represen- tatives to Parliament since the sixth year of the reign of Edward VI. It was, at an early period, governed by a \" portgreve \" (an old Saxon word signifying governor) and twelve brethren. It so continued until Edward VI., in the year 1549, gave it a charter of incorporation, aud changed the title of the chief magistrate to that of \" mayor \" ; the corporation being deno- minated \"the mayor, jurats, and common- alty of Maidstone.\" The charter was forfeited in the reign of Queen Mary, as a penalty for the part the townspeople took in the Wyatt insurrection, but was restored, and a new one was granted by Queen Elizabeth, under the title of \" the mayor aud aldermen of Maidstone.\" This charter was renewed and amended by charters from James I. in 1603, 1619 and 1621, from Charles II. in 1682, and George II. in 1747, which last was that upon which the rights and privileges of the burgesses were based until the Municipal Act of 1835. The borough bas its own court of quarter sessions and police force. The corporation act as_tho urban sanitary authority, and in 1851-2 erected the public baths and wash- houses ; they have also constructed main"], [138, "98 drainage works, at a cost of \u00a330,000. A new bridge has been erected at a cost of \u00a332,000. The waterworks and gas works are in the hands of private com panies. A burial board, appointed by the ratepayers, control a cemetery of 25 acres in extent, situate on the Sutton road. The buildings comprise the parish church of All Saints, rebuilt in 1395 by Archbishop Courtenay, and occupying the site of an ancient church dedicated to the Virgin. It still con tains twenty-eight carved oak stalls, made for the members of the arch bishop's college. The church of the Holy Trinity was consecrated in 1838. St. Peter's is the restored chapel of the ancient Pilgrim's hospital. St. Paul's, a fine church, of the fourteenth century style, was opened for worship in 1859 ; St. Philip's in 1858 ; St. Stephen's, in the suburb of Tovil, in 1841 ; St. John's in 1860; St. Faith's in 1872, and St. Michael and All Angels' in 1876. The Wesleyans, Presbyterians, Congrega tionalists, Baptists, Primitive Metho dists, Friends, Roman Catholics, and Unitarians have also places of worship. The town hall was erected in the year 1764 ; it is used for magisterial pur poses, and is also the nomination and chief polling place for West Kent. The markets were opened in 1825, over which the large corn exchange was erected in 1835, and concert hall in 1865 ; the exchange has connected with it a farmers' club, an agricultural as sociation, a malt-duty association, a cattle-show club, and a horticultural society. The national and county build ings in Maidstone are \u2014 the barracks, erected in 1797 ; the county gaol, a large building, covering thirteen acres of land, erected in 1811-18, at a cost of \u00a3200,000 ; the county lunatic asylum, which cost \u00a350,000, opened in 1833, since greatly enlarged ; aud two county hospitals. The grammar school, under the superintendence of the corporation, was established by that body in 1547, who purchased of the Crown the build ings of the fraternity of Corpus Christi, at the suppression of monasteries, and converted them into a school for the education of the sons of burgesses. Connected with it are two scholarships of \u00a340 per annum, and chambers fol residence, in the University College, Oxford, and four day-boys' scholarships of \u00a310 each. There are also the blue- coat and Sir Charles Booth's schools, besides others connected with the churches and chapels ; a diocesan board of education, a Church of England young men's society, a young men's theological and literary society, a mutual improvement association, St. Paul's literary institute, the religious library, the literary and mechanics' institute, the Chillington house or Charles museum, and the Kent arch\u00e6ological society. The charitable institutions are \u2014 five sets of almhouses, the West Kent hospital, the Kent county ophthal- mic hospital, and various provident, friendly, and benevolent societies. The principal trade of Maidstone is in hops, many thousand acres of land about the town and neighbourhood being under cultivation for the growth of that plant, of which vast quantities are sent to tho London market. There are also some extensive paper mills, oil mills, and breweries. Market Days; every Thurs- day and the second Tuesday in each month.

The parish church, an ancient building, contains a very curious font, with"], [139, "99 strangely-carved wood-work, and bears the date of 1652. Four miles to the south of Marden is Bougbton Monchelsea, which derives the latter name from the Monchensies, or Mon- chelseas,who formerly possessed the land here ; but it is more commonly called Boughton Quarry, owing to the large quantity of Kentish rag-stone quarried in the hills to the south ofthe village. On the hill-side stands the church, an interesting old structure ; and almost adjoining the churchyard is the fine estate of Boughton Place, the house of which, situated in a spacious, well- wooded park, commands an extensive view over the Weald of Kent. Boughton Mount is also a handsome building. Liuton Park, the seat of the Cornwallis family, is about three miles and a half to the left of the Marden Station. It is a large white stuccoed mansion, sur- rounded by a well-wooded park, and commanding a most extensive view of the Weald of Kent. The church, dedicated to St. Nicholas, is a pretty structure, with embattled tower, octagonal spire, and contains several old monuments, with two by Baily, to the Cornwallis family.

It is united, by branch lines, with the South Eastern and the London Chatham and Dover railways, aud has water communication, by means of steam vessels on the Thames, with London, Gravesend, Thames Haven, (fee. Margate derives its name from its position, having been formerly called \"Mere-gate,\" theentrance to the sea. In the reign of Elizabeth it was an obscure fishing village, after which it employed about twenty small vessels in the coasting and river trade, chiefly in the conveyance of grain ; and it was not until the last century when the advantages of sea breezes and sea- bathing began to be appreciated, and its level sandy beach, salubrious air, and its proximity to London, pointed it out as a favourable locality for sea-bathing ; when it gradually rose into repute, although until the introduction of steam vessels the voyage thither in the old \" hoys \" was looked upon by the citizens of London as a formidable and perilous undertaking. Notwithstanding the many rivals which have since sprung up, Margate maintains its reputation. Margate was incor- porated in 1857, and a court of quarter sessions granted October 23rd, 1869. The police force is distinct from the county. The corporation act as the urban sanitary authority. The town is well paved, supplied with water by the Town Councd, and with gas by a joint- stock company. The burial board is distinct from the corporation ; the ceme- tery is on the Minster road. The prin- cipal buildings are \u2014 the church of St. John the Baptist, dating from the eleventh century, and containing some ancient sepulchral brasses ; Trinity church erected in 1825, the tower built to serve as a landmark ; St. Paul's built 1873 ; and chapels for the Wes- leyans, Baptists, Calvinists, Christian Brethren, Lady Huntingdon's Connec- tion, and Roman Catholics ; National, British, Catholic, and other schools ; a theatre, assembly room, skating rink, the esplanade, jetty (length 1,240 feet) and other promenades; libraries, bazaars, billiard and reading rooms, baths, and all other accessories of a watering place ; a custom house, preventive station, town hall, police station, county court, pier, 900 feet long, constructed by Rennie in 1810, aud an institute. There are also the royal sea-bathing infirmary, esta- blished in 1792, the deaf and dumb asylum, the philanthropic institution, the Alexandra homes for decayed towns- people, the patriotic home, and Yarkley's almshouses for ten widows. The trade of the town is confined to supplying the wants of the residents and visitors. Market Days : Wednesdays and Satur days. Population : 12,000. Municipal Electors: 2,412.

MARTIN.\u2014 (STATION on the Joint Line.) \u2014 A hamlet of the parish of East Langdon, in the county of Kent, and a station on the new joint line from Dover to Deal. The city and borough representation ia as follows ; London (city), four mem bers ; Chelsea, Finsbury, Hackney, Marylebone, Tower Hamlets and West minster (city), two members each. The shire has 6 hundreds, 222 civil parishes, besides parts of others, 27 poor-law unions, parishes or districts, of which 5 aro outside the metropolitan area, 26 registry districts, 20 urban sanitary authorities (exclusive of tho Metropolitan Board of Works and metropolitan sanitary and nuisance authorities, of which 29 arc in Middle sex), and 4 rural sanitary authorities. It has also one court of quarter sessions, and is divided into 17 petty sessional divisions and 18 lieutenancy sub divisions, of which the city of London is one distinct from the county. The city of London is a county of itself, governed under the provisions of its numerous charters, and has distinctive courts of justice, and its own magistracy and police force. Westminster is a chartered and prescriptive city, with a limited exorcise of municipal authority. Neither city is amenable to the Municipal Corporations Act, 1835, nor are there any boroughs within the county subject to that statute. The liberty of the Tower Hamlets is a separate juris diction, but the powers of its magis trates have been much abridged. The surface of this county is mostly level, the plain being enclosed with a circle of hills \u2014 at Highgate, Hampstead, Hornsey, and Harrow-on-the-Hill \u2014 none of which exceeds 400 feet in height, but from which a picturesque view may be obtained of the distant metropolis. The county lies within the basin of the Thames. The sub stratum is made up entirely of blue clay, or, as it is generally called, the London clay. In some parts the plastic clay attains a thickness of 100 feet to 120 feet. The soil is gravel, and although not of itself fertile, is so enriched by a profuse application of manure, that it has become equal in fertility to any part of England, and for pasture land, by the improvements made in the drainage, it far exceeds any other part of the kingdom. At the time of C\u00e6sar's invasion, this part of Britain, together with that now forming the county of Essex, was inhabited by the MAZE HILL.\u2014 (STATION.)\u2014 The Station for Greenwich Park.

MIDDLESEX (County of).\u2014 The Metropolitan County of England is bounded on tbe north by Hertford, east by Essex, south-east by Kent, south by Surrey, and west by Buckinghamshire. It is further defined by the Thames on the south, the Lea on the east, and the Colne on the west. It is one of the smallest counties in England, but by far the most important, as it contains the city of London, the great emporium of the world. Length, 26 mile3 ; breadth, 18 miles ; circumference, 104 miles ; square miles,281. In addition to the river3 already mentioned, there are the Grand Junction and other canals. Middlesex is wholly within the Metropolitan Police District, and the jurisdiction of the Cen tral Criminal Court, and constitutes an archdeaconry, in the diocese of London, and province of Canterbury. The county returns two members to parliament."], [141, "101 Trinobantes, the first British tribe that submitted to tbe sway of the Romans. On the final reduction of Britain it became a Roman province, and was included in the division called Flavia C\u00e6sariensis. The name is slightly corrupted from the Anglo-Saxon Micldle- Seaxe, signifying the county of the Middle Saxons. Including, as Middlesex does, the Metropolis, it is the seat of manufactures of all description, and the influence of its trade and commerce extends to every part of the civilized world.

NEW ROMNEY.\u2014 (Stations\u2014 HAM STREET or HYTHE\u2014 8 miles.) \u2014This place is one of the Cinque Ports, and the chief town in the Romney Marsh \" liberty,\" of the county of Kent (eastern division). It was the \" Portus Novus \" of the Romans, and is a municipal cor poration not subject to the Municipal Acts. It is in Romney Marsh union, and New Romney county court district aud petty sessional division. The char ters of the borough are similar in their grants to those of the other Cinque Ports. The corporate body consists of a mayor, jurats, and commonalty ; it is very probable that this body will soon have to give place to a Council, under the Act of 1835, the members of the second Royal Commission, issued inMarch, 1880, having so recommended. At the time of the Domesday survey, New Romney was a place of considerable importance, but, the sea having receded from it, it has almost entirely lost the situation and characteristics of a port. It returned two members to Parliament until tha passing of the Reform Act of 1832, when it was disfranchised. Most of the im portant documents and charters relating to the Cinque Ports are kept in the Guildhall at New Romney. The church of St. Nicholas is an ancient, handsome, and spacious structure, with a square tower of great height and beauty ; it has nave, aisles, and chancel, with chancel aisles, and contains a piscina and eight bells ; the tower and nave are Norman , the chancel and aisles Early English ; in 1 875 a stained window was inserted in the chan cel, in memory of the crew and passengers ofthe emigrant ship \" Northfleet,\" which wasrun down off Dungeness onthe22nd of January, 1873.

MINSTER.\u2014 (JUNCTION STA TION.) \u2014 A village and parish of the county of Kent (eastern division) ; in Thanet Isle and union, Ramsgate county court district and petty sessional division. St. Mary's church is a very old structure in mixed stydes of archi tecture. Minster Abbey \u2014 now a resi dence \u2014 is an ancient and handsome building, originally founded by Domnera, daughter of Ercombert, King of Kent, about the year 670.

NORTHFLEET.\u2014 (STATION.)\u2014 A large village and parish within the parliamentary borough of Gravesend and county of Kent (mid division) ; in North Aylesford union and Gravesend county court district and petty sessional division. After passing through the tunnel between Greenhithe and North fleet,a beautiful view, which is heightened by the picturesque appearance of Hug gins' College, with its quadrangular range of buildings and its elegant spire, presents itself to the traveller. The building, of handsome and substantial proportions, is stated on an eminence near Stone Bridge, and is adapted to the convenience and comfort of respectable decayed tradesmen, who have, in addi tion, a weekly allowance of twenty shdlings each. The college consists of forty residences, and a church with a beautiful and lofty spire. The whole of this extensive edifice was raised by tbe nobie liberality of John Huggins, Esq., of Sittingbourne, and is certainly one of the most pleasing instances recorded in our country of individual benevolence. The village, which lies two miles west of Gravesend, is on a chalk cliff rising to a considerable height above the river. It is a favourite resort of the Londoners, for whose convenience several steam boats leave Rosherville Pier at frequent intervals forthe Tilbury Railway Station. Here are large cement and chemical works giving employment to some hun dreds of bauds. The view of the village from the river is very picturesque, displaying to advantage the celebrated lime-kilns, which invariably attract the eye as the leading feature in the land scape. The church, one of the largest in the county, is an ancient and com manding edifice, partially covered with ivy. The great attraction of visitors is Rosherville Gardens, considered the most beautiful artificially picturesque grounds in the kingdom. The name is derived from the late proprietor, Jeremiah Rosher, Esq. The family of this gentle man founded and endowed a handsome church at Rosherville, in the Transition style of architecture. It is remarkable for the beauty of the stone carving, with which it is highly decorated. There is a richly-stained glass chancel window, and also two other memorial windows at the east end of each aisle. Northfleet has an extensive dockyard for ship building, which affords employment to hundreds of the surrounding population. The north-west marsh was formerly covered by the Thames; but is now pro tected by high flood-gates. There are some good residences in this neighbour hood ; among them are Wombwell Hal), Oldbury Cottage, Brook Vale, New House, .fee. Perry Street is a populous district, about a mile south of the church, chiefly of new houses. Crossing tho cemetery at Northfleet, and proceeding some distance, a turn on the left con ducts to Springhead, a favourite resort of Gravesend visitors, and celebrated for its water-cress plantations, nourished by a stream which meanders along soma quarter of a mile of fruit and flower garden-ground. At this spot visitors congregate in large numbers during tho summer months, not only for the pur chase of water-cresses, but to feast on strawberries and other dainties. From hence, a walk may agreeably be extended to Southfleet, which is only a quarter of a mile distant, and is a part, too, of this same rich cultivated valley, which in ancienttimes slept beneath the waters of the Thames. Halting beneath a huge wal nut tree that overhangs the village school, we read above the antiquated porch the inscription \u2014 \" This school was founded by the piety of Sir John Sedley, Bart., a.d. 1637 ; augmented by Mrs. Elizabeth Sedley, his daughter, a.d. 1639 ; polished and maintained by Sir Charles Sedley, Bart., his son, whom God long continue. Amen.\" Scadbery, at present a plain farmhouse, was anciently one of the Sedley family estates and seemingly a favourite one, to judge from tho numerous monuments to be seen within the adjoining church. There are brass effigies to John Sedley and wife, having inscribed thereon this strange injunction : \" Dig not w*yn too ffote of this tomb.\" Next, i3 a gorgeous marble monument with rich canopy overhanging a reclining knightly figure, almost as perfect as when it first left the sculptor's hands, and 9"], [144, "104 church is a large and ancient edifice, containing numerous monuments to the Roberts family of Glassenbury.

Pens hurst Castle (or Place) is the far-famed seat of the Sidneys, open to the public on Mondays and Saturdays, and other days by special permission. Penshurst was erected in the time of Edward VI., in the possession of Sir Steven de Pens hurste, who was made constable and warden of the Cinque Ports by Henry III. ; afterwards it was conveyed to John de Pulteney, who in the reign of Edward III. was knighted ; from this family it came by marriage to Sir John Devereux. After passing through many bands, it was, in the fourth year of Ed ward VI., by the attainder of Sir Ralph Vane, forfeited to the crown, by whom it was given, \"with themanours, lands, and appurtenaynces thereunto belonginge, vnto his trvstye and wel-beloved Bervant Syr William Sydney, Knight Banneret,\" one of the heroic warriors at Flodden Field. The mansion, which stands near the south-west corner of a noble park of considerable extent and much diversified surface, is a large castellated structure, formed into quadrangles, and exhibiting the various styles of two or three succes sive centuries. The principal front ex tends upwards of 300 feet in length. The mansion encloses a spacious quadran gle. An inner portal opens into a cor ridor, where there are th ree arched door ways, leading to the buttery, kitchen, &c. This is divided from the hall by a screen, over which is a gallery for the minstrels ; and from this gallery there were communications with the principal apartments on the north side of the man sion. The fine old baronial hall is 54 feet long by 38 wide. At the upper end of the hall is the dais, or raised plat form. There are three antique tables \u25a0still showing strong traces of its former colouring. Notfar distant may be seen several pieces of court armour, consisting chiefly of a helmet or two, a goodly sword, and a pair of heavy spurs, no doubt worn by the same knight when he was called upon to play his part in some court ceremonial. Near to them is an ornamented canopy. The chancel win dow is of painted glass ; and in this part ofthe church is a triple graduated stone Sedilia, decorated with pinnacles. Close beside is the piscina, and more towards the nave are some carved wooden stalls of an ancient date. But the most re markable architectural object in South fleet Church is the font of Kentish rag stone, carved round its eight sides with scriptural devices of a hieroglyphical character difficult to explain.

To the left is a suite of apartments, called Lady Perry's. In one of the corridors of the modern apartments, are pieces of armour, and relics of the sixteenth and following cen turies. The old hall, with its noble tim ber roof, belongs to an age long prior to PENSHURST CASTLE. mented. A brass cabinet, inlaid with tortoiseshell, is covered with curious and valuable antiques, many of them disco vered at Herculaneum.

A small room adjoining this is called the second page's room. Seve ral pictures and works of art have been removed into the modern rooms, wbich are tastefully adorned. The picture gallery is about 90 feet long. There is the proprietorship of the Sidneys : the steps in some parts of the mansion are mere rude, solid blocks of oak, and the floors of many of the apartments are formed of huge planks of the same wood, that seem to have been hewn out with the adze, then cut by the saw and po lished by the plane ; whereas, other parts exhibit the marks of architectural periods considerably nearer our own day \u25a0 \u2014 some, indeed, within the present cen tury, at the time of the last renovation.

PLUCKLEY. \u2014 (STATION.)\u2014 A village and parish of the county of Kent {eastern division) ; in West Ashford union and Ashford county court district and petty sessional division. The ancient parish of Pevington is now merged in that of Pluckley. [There are several in teresting and extensive estates within a moderate distance of Pluckley. Goding ton, the noble( residence of the Toke family, who boast of a lineal descent from the Sire de Touque, who came over with the Conqueror and fought at Hastings, is a building partly ancient and partly modernized ; it stands in a tine park of about 600 acres, planted by a celebrated landscape gardener of the last century. The church, also, is a handsome Norman structure, with a lofty steeple at its west end ; and in the in terior are some fine old monuments of refectory. The latter has been converted into a barn, while other portions of the ancient site are occupied by a farmhouse and stables. The whole of this estate was given up at the Reformation and sold. The church is a handsome and ancient building, with a tower and small beacon turret. At the distance of about two miles hence is another noble seat, Eastwell Park, now the property and residence of their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. The park comprises about 2,000 acres of some of the finest land in Kent, having a very varied surface of hill and dale, and com manding in its more elevated parts a prospect, both north and south, many miles in extent, from Sheerness on one side, to the Channel and France on the other ; it is tastefully laid out, and con tains some noble forest trees ; besides which it is abundantly stocked with deer. The mansion is said to occupy the site where formerly stood the humble cottage erected by Richard Plantagenet, the natural son of Richard III. It stands at the north-east corner of the park, a modern structure, built by Bonomi, on a magnificent scale, with an imposing frontage, and containing a suite of splen did state apartments, with accommoda tion for a large number of guests, be sides exteusive offices, stabliug, (fee, and tastefully-arranged gardens. The village of Eastwell derives its name from the springs or wells with which it is watered, bearing the addition of East to distin guish it, from the adjoining parish of Westwell. Eastwell church, besides several monuments of the Finches, former owners of the estate, contains in its chancel a curious old tomb of Richard Plantagenet. The circumstances attending the residence of this personage at Eastwell are curious. In the year 1543 or 1544 Sir Thomas Moyle, who was erecting a mansion at Eastwell, having noticed that his principal brick layer did not associate with the others, but retired when work was finished, to read, he came upon him suddenly one day, and snatching the book out of his hand, found it was a Latin work. Upon questioning him, be reluctantly acknow ledged that he was a son of King Richard III., after whose defeat at Bosworth, he, being then sixteen years of age, escaped to London, and by way of efieetual con- the Tokes. East Sutton, once a part of the possessions of Odo, the Conqueror's half-brother, after passing successively into the hands of Aylnier, Earl of Pem- broke, Lord Grey de Ruthyn, and others, came at last, in 1010, by purchase, to Sir Edward Filmer, to whose descend- ants it still belongs. The present house is mostly modern, and stands in a park tastefully laid out and thickly clothed with forest trees, chiefly oaks and ashes ; and fronting the mansion is a fine piece of water. The church stands near the summit of a h. 11 overlooking the park. Ulcombe, the ancieut seat of the St. Ledgers. Boughton Malherbe, the pro- perty of the Wottons from the time of Richard II., and the birth-place of the accomplished Sir Henry Wotton, who had the confidence successively of Queen Elizabeth and James I. Thomas, Lord Wotton, lived here in the reign of King Charles I., and the Earl of Chesterfield was the last nobleman who maintained the hospitality and splendour which had distinguished the owners of this castel- lated mansion. Leeds Castle (which \u25a0see) may be reached from here or from Headcorn. Charing is a village about Jive miles and a half north-east of Pluckley station, celebrated as having been once the site of a pidace belonging to the see of C'anteibury ; and near the \u2022ehurch may be seen very extensive re- mains, including a gateway, chapel, and"], [148, "108 cealment put himself apprentice to a bricklayer, and had continued regularly in the business. Sir Thomas, being satis fied of the truth of his statement, would not allow him to continue his labours, but. built a cottage for him, iu which he resided till he died, at an advanced age ; which event occurred, according to the register of Eastwell church, in Decem ber, 1550. A spring of water here still retains the name of Plantagenet's well. As an ecclesiastical structure, Eastwell church, however, is incomparably sur passed by that in the neighbouring parish of Boughton-Aluph, a cross-church of great beauty, and, though much dilapi dated, showing the traces of no little former splendour. To the north of Pluck ley, also, are two other estates of con siderable importance \u2014 Hothfield House, long the seat of the Earls of Thanet ; and Surrenden-Dering, the property of the Dering family ; both of them handsome mansions, well situated, so as to com mand extensive views of the adjacent country, and surrounded by wellwooded parks. Hothfield House is comparatively a modern building, having been erected about tbe year 1776. It was in a field on this estate recently enclosed from the common, that Jack Cade, the Kentish rebel, was killed in 1450, by Walter Iden, the High Sheriff of Kent.] Area : 3,094 acres.

It is included in the jurisdic tions of the Central Criminal Court and the Metropolitan Police. Plumstead Marshes were first enclosed jn the reign of Edward I., by the Monks of Lessness Abbey. Frequent comrninations were issued by the Crown for repairing tlie banks and breaches. Through insufficient attention, however, 2,000 acres were inundated in the time of Henry VIII., and these were not wholly recovered until the reign of James I. Reviews of tbe Artillery take place here, and the Marshes are also utilized for gun practice, ranges, and powder magazines. The town contains some handsome residences, Woolwich having contributed very much to its growth. The church is an old foundation, but many alterations and additions have been made to accommo date the increasing population. This building is on the same range with Shooter's Hill, one mile and a half dis tant. Market gardening is carried on at Plumstead to some extent, and near the Common are brick fields, tile kilns, sand pits, and chalk pits. Area: 3,371 acres of land and 344 of water.

The jurisdiction of the Cinque Ports magis trates extends over the whole of Rams gate. The town derives its name from the British \" Rimn's gate \" \u2014 Rimn being the pre- Roman designation of Thanet \u2014 and comprises the two parishes of Rams gate and St. Lawrence. Tho Town Hall wa3 erected in 1839, and the Seamen's Infirmary in 1849. The Ramsgate sands are excellent for bathing, and are the favourite resort, also, of a large portion of the visitors during the summer. The chief glory of Ramsgate, however, is its harbour, of which, iu 1807, Mr. Rennie was appointed engineer, having two piers, that on the east side 2,000 feet, and the western 1,550 feet long, leaving an opening 200 feet wide, forming splendid promenades, and enclosing a water area of 48 acres, divided into an inner and outer harbour, the former enclosed by floodgates and provided with a commodious graving-dock, the latter drying nearly to its entrance at low water. At the end of the western pier is a lighthouse, where, during night, a light is exhibited when the tide permits"], [149, "\"RAMSGATE HARBOUR AND PIER"], [150, "110 It is in the Gothic style, with a steeple 137 feet high. The length of the church is 148 feet, and the width about 68 feet ; it cost \u00a328,000, and is nearly filled with stained glass. St. Lawrence's Church ia a handsome structure iu the early Nor- man style. A district church or ehapel- of-ease to St. Lawrence, erected 18_4, ou the East Cliff, is dedicated to the Holy Trinity. Christ Church stands in a pleasant situation at the head of the vale, near the West Cliff, and was consecrated in 1847. It is a handsome erection in the EarlyEnglish style, built of ragstone, with stone quoins and buttresses, and consists of a nave, chancel, side-aisles, with porches on the north and south sides, and a tower surmounted by a lofty- spire. All Souls' Church Ls in Broad Street. St. Augustine's Catholic Church is situated on the West Cliff near tho Royal Terrace. It consists of a nave, central tower, a deep chancel, enclosed with richly-carved oak screens, a lady chapel, St. Ethelbert's aisle and a south transept, part of which is enclosed and forms the founder's chapel, with an altar dedicated to St. Lawrence, the patron of the old parish. All the windows are filled with stained glass. The interior length of the church is 90 feet, and the extreme width of transept 60 feet. The walls are built of flint, and the dressings, as well as the internal walls, of Whitby stone. The style is Early Decorated. There are cloisters and a school attached to the church. The whole was erected from the designs and at the cost of the late A. Welby Pugin, the founder of the church, who resided in Ramsgate on the West Cliff in the rear of the promenade. Facing the church is the monastery of St. Benedict, which provides accommo- dation for 12 monks of that order. The Sailors' Home and Mission Church were built in 1877, and opened in June, 1878. Iu tbe yard at St. Augustine's stands a chantry chapel erected for the family of the late Mr. Digby. It is of tbe de corated period in style, and displays some Devonshire marble in the shape of small columns. The Nonconformists have several chapels here. There is also a Jews' Synagogue. The streets of Rams gate (Harbour Street, High Street, and Queen Street, being the chief), are well paved and brilliantly lighted with gas. The Improvement Commissioners own the entrance of vessels. The piers are built of granite and Purbeck stone, rising lu! feet above high water mark, and are 26 feet broad at top, furnishing, as we Have said, beautiful promenade walks for the inhabitants and visitors. The har- bour-master has a handsome residence close to the gates at the eastern entrance; the western pier being approached by the wall dividing the two basins, as well as from the cliS above by a staircase familiarly known as Jacob's Ladder. There is also a corresponding flight of steps on the other side, called Augusta Stairs, leading from the sands to the Mount Albion estate. Near the pier is an obelisk to commemorate the embarka- tion of George IV., from this port to Hanover, in 1821. His Majesty com- manded that henceforth the harbour should be called \"the Royal Harbour of Ramsgate,\" in consequence of which the Custom House was subsequently removed from Sandwich. The port is accessible to vessels not exceeding 400 tons burden within two hours of high water, and, owing to its safety, is used by an immense number cf ships. Besides which it enjoys a small trade with HoUand and tha Baltic, and a considerable coasting trade. The marine population, too, are extensively engaged in fishing and going to the aid of vessels in distress on the Goodwin Sands, directly opposite, at a distance of five or six miles. The Slip- way was erected in 1838-9. The dimen- sions are 480 feet long and 60 feet wide ; and the apparatus is calculated to draw up vessels of from 400 to 500 tons. burden ; 490 sail have been received in this, harbour at one time. A military road for the embarkation and debarka tion of troops was completed mary years back. 1' lootlgates, of a width to admit vessels of any tonnage, surmounted with elegant iron bridges, divide the inner and outer harbour. A substantial jetty of stone, projecting from the basin- wall into the outer basin, occupies the place of the former one of wood. A new engine-house and covered workshops for the men, have replaced the sheds in which they formerly carried on their operations ; aud the lighthouse has been entirely re- erected from its foundation. A lifeboat is kept for use. The pier is, perhaps, the finest marine parade in the kingdom. St. George's Church was built in 1827."], [151, "111 both the gas and water works. There are banking establishments, a savings bank, with a literary institute, assembly- rooms, several good libraries, dispensary, town-hall, custoin-house, music-hall, (tc. An excellent promenade on the West Cliff, laid out in an ornamental manner, forms a delightful source of healthy recreation. In 1859, during certain alterations of a sanitary nature, a num- ber of coins were found in the \" Roman trenches;\" tbey are of the year 48. Tho markets are extremely well supplied with meat, excellent fish, Arc. : and few places on the coast are so cheap as well as healthy and agreeable for a summer's residence. The environs of Ramsgate are charmingly picturesque and diversi- fied. There are several handsome resi- dences. East Cliff Lodge, pleasantly situated about a mile to the north-east of the town, is a large marine villa, belonging to Sir Moses Montesiore. Arklow House, the property of G. S. Measom, Esq., J. P., is noteworthy as the last residence of Mrs. Elizabeth Fry. The caverns at East Cliff deserve par- ticular notice ; they are formed by an ex- cavation at the distance of 30 feet from the cliff, and parallel with it, descending gradually to the level ofthe shore. This subterraneous passage i-eceives its light from arches of such large capacity as to resemble rooms, which are cut at right angles through the chalky cliffs opening to the sea, and these arches being in summer carpeted with turf, and covered with shrubs and flowers, appear very picturesque. The lowest arch termi- nates in a passage leading directly to the beach. Market Days: Wednesdays and Saturdays. Area: 355 acres, of which 95 are water. Population: 14,6-10.

READING.\u2014 (TERMINAL STA TION.)\u2014The largest and chief town of the county of Berks ; a parliamentary (returning two members) and municipal borough, assize, and market town, and poor-law union of three parishes. The town is situated on the south side of the River Thames, across which there is a bridge, and is intersected by two branches of the Kennet, over which also there are bridges. It is in tbe hundred and deanery of Reading, archdeaconry of Berks, and diocese of Oxford. Reading is a great railway centre, having eonu munication with the metropolis by the Great Western, South Western, and South Eastern Railways, and having lines radiating to Hungerford, Basing- stoke, Farnborough, (fee. It is 39 miles from London by road. Reading derived its name from \" Redin,\" a British word, signifying fern, which grew here very- abundantly. The town was fortified as early as 871, in which year it was taken by the Danes, who held it until 1006, and then destroyed it by fire.- In Domesday Book \"Redinge\" is stated to have had twenty-eight houses, so that it appears theu scarcely to have recovered from the calamity of 1006. In 1121 a mitred abbey was founded by Henry I., who died and was buried here. The abbey was used as a royTal residence by Henry I. and several of his successors, aud parliaments were held here in 1440 and 1451. In the Parliamentary war Reading was held for the king. Essex besieged the town for a fortnight, and upon King Charles and Prince Rupert coming to its relief, a battle ensued on Caversham Bridge, when tbe Royalists were defeated. The abbey suffered greatly during the siege, and there re- main now only a gateway and the noble ruins of the great hall. Prior to the Reformation there existed a hospital for lepers, founded in 1134 by Abbot Aucherius ; a hospital for twenty-six brethren, and for the entertainment of pilgrims, established by Hugh, the eighth abbot ; a Franciscan monastery, and one of Grey Friars, of which there are no remains, excepting a window aud part of the church of the Grey Friars.

RE CULVER.\u2014 (Station\u2014 GROVE FERRY \u2014 4 miles.) \u2014 A parish and village of the county of Kent (eastern division) ; in Bleau union and Canterbury county court district ard petty sessional divi sion. This place is well known for its church, called the Two Sisters, from two towers at the west end, each surmounted by a spire, and which serve the purposes of a landmark. The towers, all that remain of the ancient church, were pur chased by the corporation of the Trinity House of the parish in 1810, and groins have been laid down for their preserva tion. According to an . ccount written by a Dominican friar of Canterbury, who quitted England at tho time of the Reformation for Louvain, where he died, and bequeathed his collection of MSS. to its University, the designation of the \"Two Sisters\" arose thus: Frances St. Clair, Lady Abbess of Benedictine Nuns at Faversham, being visited by a violent sickness, vowed that, in the event of recovery, she would visit the shrine of the Blessed Virgin at Bradstow (Broad stairs), and there offer up a costly present in gratitude for the Virgin's intercession in her behalf. In fulfilment whereof, she embarked on board a vessel, accompanied court of quarter sessions and its own police force. The gasworks and ceme tery are in the hands of joint- stock companies. St. Lawrence's Church, built in 1434, stands on the site of a still older church. St. Mary's was rebuilt from the ruins of the abbey in 1551. Trinity Church was erected in 1826 ; St. John's in 1837 ; St. Mary's Episcopal Church, built for a dissenting congrega tion, in 1799, came into the possession of the Church of England in 1836 ; the other churches are\u2014 St. Giles, Grey Friars (on the site of the old monastic church), Christ Church, St. Stephen's, and All Saints. There are Baptist, Congregational, Primitive Methodist, Independent, Wesleyan Methodist, and Friends' chapels ; also a handsome Roman Catholic chapel, in the Saxon style, erected on the ruins of the abbey. The county and municipal buildings are the county gaol and house of correction, tho latter on the Pentonville model ; the town hall and police station, the cattle market, <fcc. There are also a theatre and other minor places of amusement, a Freemasons' lodge, and meeting places for societies. The charitable institutions are Kendrick's, Vachel's, Hall's, and other almshouses ; the Royal Berkshire Hospital, established in 1839 ; a dis pensary, a hom\u0153opathic dispensary, a philanthropic institution, and various other associations for charitable pur poses. The charities are managed by three separate boards of trustees for the general charities, the church charities, and Kendrick's charities. The edu cational establishments aie the royal grammar school, founded by Henry VII., the blue coat school, the girls' green coat school, a foundation school, national schools, a school of science and art, infant schools, and three board schools, and an athen\u00e6um. The town was at one period famous for its cloth manufacture ; but in Camden's time it had declined, the inhabitants having begun to give more attention to \" maulting \" : \" For whereas they had formerly seven score cloathiers, now their number is but very small.\" At present there is an extensive miscellaneous trade carried on in sup plying the shopkeepers of surrounding towns, by wholesale, with gcods of every description, wbich is much facilitated by the many railways running in all"], [153, "113 by her sister Isabel, to whom she was much attached, on tho 3rd of May, the feast of he Holy Cross ; but they had not been at sea two hours before a storm arose, which drove the vessel on a sand bank near Reculver. Part of the crew succeeded in reaching the shore in a boat, but Isabel, who remained on board the wreck for some hours, although rescued from it afterwards, died the following day from exhaustion. To perpetuate the memory of this event, and to serve as a guide to mariners, the Abbess, who, with all the passengers, had been saved, caused the church towers to be repaired, and two spiral elevations to be added, which she terns, fibulae, and a variety of trinkets. with some British and Saxon coins, have been discovered. By the fall of the cliff at different times, lumps of metal have been met with, seeming to indicate the destruction of the place by fire. There can be no doubt that, besides being a Roman station of importance, it was the site of a large town inhabited by that people. Hilborough is on the line of Roman Road to Durovernum. At Bishopstoue and at Regulbium Camp are coast-guard stations. A considerable part of the parish adjoining tho river is marsh. Brookhouse is a seat here. To the north the coast is a bluff cliff, except THE RECULVERS (NORTH COAST OP KENT). along the marshes, where it is guarded by a sea wall, through which the river is discharged by the Northmouth Sluice. Area : 1 ,653 acres, of which 4U5 are water. Population : 257. RED HILL.-(JUNCTION STA TION.) \u2014 A township (forming the eastern ward) of the municipal borough of Reigate (which see). The Brighton main line continues from this station. The Philanthropic Society's farm school for the reformation of juvenile offenders, is in the vicinity. This institution was founded as far back as 1788, tbe society then haviDg premises in the London directed should be called the Sisters The church was founded in the seventh century, together with a monastery for Black Canons, by one Basse, upon land granted to him by Egbert, king of Kent. King Ethelbert, the Britwald, retired here after his conversion, and is said to be buried in the Abbey. Ethelbert the Second, king of Kent, who died in 760, was interred here. There are considerable remains of the Regulbium\u2014 a Roman fort, within the walls of which the royal palace of Ethelbert, and the monastery before mentioned, were erected.

Reigate is desig nated in Domesday Book as \" Church felle,\" or \" the Church in the Field.\" It is supposed to have been a Saxon town possessing a fortress, but there are few records of its history previous to the Norman era. After the Conquest it fell into the hands of the powerful Earls of Warren and Surrey, who built a castle, called Holm Castle, on a rock overlook ing the town, beneath which is a remark able cavern, where, according to local tradition, the barons met to arrange the terms of Magna Charta. The castle has disappeared, and the space which it occupied is now a public garden vested in the corporation by Earl Somers, whoso residence,\" The Priory,\" marks tbe site of an ancient religious establishment. The Priory Park is open to the public ; it is rich in sylvan scenery, and is much frequented. Lord Howard of Efimgham, the commander of Queen Elizabeth's navy against the Spanish Armada, and Archbishop Usher, aro buried in the chancel of the parish church ; their rest ing places are not indicated by even simple inscriptions on the pavement. In a room above the vestry, built in 1503, is an unique library, formed in 1701 by the Rev. Andrew Cranstoun, vicar. It contains over 1,700 volumes, including some very choice manuscripts. Many of the books were given by the celebrated John Evelyn, of Wotton. Among other relics is shown Lord Howard's prayer-book. The borough returned two members to Parliament until the Reform Act of 1832, when its representation was reduced to one; it was disfranchised in 1867 owing to the prevalence of corrupt practices. Reigate was incorporated on September llth, 1863, and the council adopted the Public Health Act in 1805. Main drainage works have been provided, and the corporation own a sewage farm of 200 acres. The borough is supplied with gas by two companies, and with water by two companies. The cemetery adjoins the churchyard and is controlled by a burial board. The borough has a Road, St. George's Fields, fro n which they removed in 1S49. Ciiminal boys are here employed, reclaimed, and sent abroad. Red Hill has two district churches, a market ball (market held alternate Wednesdays), and several chapels. The Earlswood estate, for merly the property of Mr. Justice Talfourd, now belongs to the Asylum for Idiots, founded ;n 1847. This noble building was erected at a cost of \u00a330,000, and the institution has now sprung, by the favour of the benevolent British public, into one of our greatest national asylums. It had its origin iu the suggestion of that true philanthro pist, the late Dr. Andrew Reed, the founder of no fewer than six charitable institutions, of all of which he has been the gratuitous honorary secretary. Dr. Reed travelled abroad with this object in view ; and after seeing the state of cretinism in France, Germany, and Switzerland, he went to Sweden and Denmark, and at length set on foot the first asylum in England for this afflicted portion of the human family. The \u25a0design of this asylum is not merely to take care of the idiot, but, by the skilful and earnest application of the best means, to prepare him, as far as possible, for the duties and enjoyments of life. Her Majesty has contributed largely to the funds, and the late Prince Consort laid the foundation and opened this building. The erection forms one of the most attractive objects upon this line. At Red Hill, in the time of Charles I., a considerable number of the Royalists were dislodged by the Parlia mentary forces under Sir William Waller. Principal Hotel : Railway.

The castle was repaired by Edward IV., but soon after fell to decay. In 676 the city was destroyed by Ethelred, the Mercian, and in 830 by the Danes, who besieged it in 885, but were compelled to raise the siego by Alfred. In 986 it was besieged by Ethelred ; in 998 sacked by the Danes. In 930 Athelstan established three mints in the city, and Canute landed here ; the city suffered severely from five fires in the twelfth century. Wat Tyder attacked the castle ; in 1251 a grand tournament between English and foreign knights was held here ; and in 1688 James IL, on his abdication, em barked for the continent from Rochester. The city has returned two members to Parliament from an early period. The see was founded and a church built by Ethelbert, after his conversion by Augus tine, who also founded a monastery, both which buildings wer3 partially destroyed by the Danes, but were re-established by Bishop Gundulf, who also displaced the secular canons, and established a Benedictine monastery of sixty monks. In 1201 a Scotch baker, going on pil grimage to Jerusalem, being killed on his passage through Kent, was buried in Rochester cathedral, canonized as St. William, and his shrine became a great place of devotion. The cathedral, a fine old edifice, was commenced by Ethelbert, and is a fine specimen of the Anglo- Saxon and Norman style3, but very little of the original building remains. The castle, built in the reigu of the Con queror, is a massive Norman erection, of which the keep still remains \u2014 a fine feature in the landscape. It is 70 feet square at the base, and 104 feet high. Portions of the wall of St. Andrew's priory (founded in the year 600), of St. William's gates, and St. Catherine's hospital for leper3, are still standing. The city was incorporated by Henry H., the charter being confirmed by subse quent monarchs, the governing charter to the time of the Municipal Act being that of Charles I., which granted a mayor, recorder, and twelve aldermen. The cor poration is the urban sanitary authority. There are waterworks and gasworks vested in companies. Public recreaticn grounds have been provided by the cor poration, notably those adjoining tho Hastings county court district, and Battle petty sessional division.

At a very early period it was a consider able military station, as Bede terms it \"the castle of the Kentish men,\" and a fortress appears to have been erected here, possibly to guard the passage over the river. Tbe manor was given by the Conqueror to his brother Odo, bishop of Bayeaux, who built the present castle, of which he was dispossessed by Rufus for revolting against his authority. In the reign of Henry I. the archbishops of Canterbury were its constables, but held that office only until the reign of Stephen. During the struggle between John and his barons, the castle was held by William de Albini, against the King, but was taken by the Royalists, and afterwards retaken by the Dauphin of France.

The town is quite a modern creation, the first plans for it having been formed by Decimus Burton about forty years ago. The plan was a bold one, and it was executed with no little spirit ; for within that period there have been constructed a noble esplanade, extending for more than three miles along the beach; a handsome range of buildings called the Marina, extending along the sea-front of the town, fronted with a covered colonnade of the same length, and several other terraces, as well as detached villas, together with four churches, assembly rooms, bath-houses, libraries, and hotels. St. Leonard's also possesses pleasure grounds, and other appliances for the amusement or comfort of its visitors, among whom have always been many of our distinguished nobility and wealthy aristocracy.

PETER'S .\u2014(Station\u2014 RAMSGATE-3 miles.)\u2014 A parish and village of the county of Kent (eastern division) ; in Isle of Thanet union and Margate county court district and petty sessional division. The parish is a member of the Cinque Port of Dover, and within the jurisdiction of the Cinque Ports magistrates. The town of Broad stairs is included in its limits. Tbe parish church of St. Peter dates from the 12th century ; its tower forms a conspicuous landmark for mariners ; it shows the effects of an earthquake, which happened about three hundred years ago. There are also chapels for Nonconformists. The sea-side residence ofthe Archbishops of Canterbury \u2014 Stone House \u2014 is situated in the parish, near the North Foreland, and contiguous thereto are the St. Peter's Orphan and Convalescent Homes, which owe their foundations, principally, to the active exertions of the present prelate and his lamented lady. Area : 299 acres. Popu lation : 1,926. accession to the throne in 488. It is believed to have derived its name from a large wood which formerly covered this part of the coast. There is an interval of nearly four hundred years before we find any reference to the place. In the year 949 the manor was possessed by one Wulfstan, from whom it passed to Leoflaede, who granted it to the Church of Christ in Canterbury. Earl Godwin held it from the archbishop by the tenure of a knight's service, and after the Conquest it was comprised in King William's grants to Hugo de Mont fort, subject, as far as can be ascertained, to the proprietary rights of the see. Whether or not a fortress did stand hero at the close of the Saxon era can only be surmised, but it is thought probable that Hugo erected, or restored, one, and that from that time strenuous efforts were made to shake off the claims of the arch bishops to the estate. Hugo's grandson, Robert, forfeited his inheritance to Henry I. by treasonable acts, and Henry, Lord Raleigh, who appears to have been the holder of the manor in the early part of Henry II. 's reign, was dispossessed of it for cowardly behaviour in the Welsh wars. It was this seizure by the Crown which gave Thomas a Becket a pretext for complaining that the king had vio lated the privileges of his ecclesiastical office by seizing on a fief belonging to it. Thefact that the prelate's four murderers \u2014 Reginald Fitzurze, William de Tracy, Hugh de Morvil, and Richard Brito \u2014 slept in the castle the night before the tragedy, which gave a notable saint to the Roman calendar, is held by many authorities to be satisfactory proof that the king personally retained it, after the deprivation of Lord Raleigh. In the first year of his reign, King John, actuated by a desire to cultivate friendly relations with the rightful owners, re leased the castle and manor to them ; and here the unfortunate Edward IT. was once entertained by an occupant of the see. In 1377 (temp. Richard II.) Archbishop Courtenay wholly rebuilt the mansion ; his arms (three bezants with a label of three points) are still remaining on the sides of the great gateway im paled with those of the see of Canterbury. He also enclosed a spacious park round the outer walls. The castlo continued to be one of the favourite residences of SALTWOOD C A S T L E.\u2014 (Station \u2014 HYTHE \u2014 4 mile.) \u2014 Salt wood is a village and parish of the county of Kent (eastern division) ; in Elham union, and Hythe county court district and petty sessional division. Shortly after quitting the main line of the rail way, beyond Westenhanger, and but a very short distance from the junction, observation is certain to be attracted towards a wooded dell of exquisite beauty on the Up side of the line. Luxuriously embosomed in this charming bower are the magnificent ruins of the baronial and archiepiscopal castle of Saltwood. The enchanting location of tbis venerable building is a convincing testimony to the fervency with which our forefathers worshipped the beauties of nature. Escus, or Oise, a son of Hengist the Saxon, and king of Kent, is said to have built a castle on this spot soon after his"], [161, "121 the archbishops, until Cranmer, to ap pease the discontent of some of the court nobles, surrendered it, with the manor, to Henry VIII. Thomas Cromwell, Earl of E\u00absex, was the next owner, and on his attainder the Crown again resumed possession. Edward VI. bestowed them on John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, almost as soon as Le came to the throne ; but two years after Dudley exchanged them with the young monarch for other property. The King then gave them to Edward Fynes, Lord Clinton. In the course of her royal progress through Kent, Queen Elizabeth paid a visit to the castle, riding hither from Sandgate on a pillion, behind Sir Walter Raleigh, with whom his gracious mistress danced gateway, now bricked up to form dwell ings for farm labourers, was defended by a portcullis, and is flanked by the two towers which rear their lofty beads high above the luxuriant trees which spring from the verdant banks of the broad and deep moat. The railway embankment is constructed so near the castle as to make the eastern portion of the ravine almost level with the exterior line of stonework. The court-yard is now filled with barns formed out of the ruins, but at its further end are the remains of the entrance hall, which goes through Us the back, and led originally into an inner court, now divided into two apartments. In one of these apartments, which is vaulted and groined, the principal orna- THE GATEWAY OP SALTWOOn CASTLE. a \" saraband \" \u2014 a kind of saltatory exer- cise then in vogue \u2014 on the castle green. In 1580 an earthquake destroyed a great portion of the building, and Mr. Robert Broadnax, of Hythe, who purchased the estate of Lord Clinton, disparked it. During tho three hundred years which have since elapsed, Saltwood has known more than a dozen different proprietors ; the ownership descending by sale or testamentary disposition. Mr. William Deedes, of San lling Park, lately one of the members o>\" parliament for the east- ern division of the county, is the present possessor. The castle stands on the summit of a gentle elevation, and oc cupies, with its enclosing walls, a nearly elliptical area of four acres. The main ment is the Tudor rose. The round towers contain hexagonal chambers, in habited by farm servants. The walls of the inner court are polygonal, approach ing the form of a circle. The walls of the banqueting room, hall, and other fine rooms still remain, and several spacious vaults, under different parts of the de cayed stronghold, are used for domestic purposes. From the roofs of the towers the seaward view is very extensive, the horizon being bounded by the white cliffs between Cape Grisnez and Boulogne. The outer walls, with their projecting turrets, are in some places from fifteen to twenty feet high, of massive thickness, and richly clothed with creeping ivy. The principal entrance on the north side"], [162, "122 township and urban sanitary district (partly in Cheriton and partly in Folke stone parishes) of the county of Kent (eastern division) ; in Elham union and petty sessional division, and Folkestone county court district. The town is at the foot of the hills crowned by Shorn cliffe Camp. At present Sandgate is tho terminus of the branch line from Westen hanger Junction, but the works are in progress for continuing tho railway to tbe Folkestone Harbour Station. The place is more often spoken of as a village than a town, but as it is now governed by a local board, aud invested with the powers of an urban sanitary authority imder the Public Health Act, it is legally entitled to tho principal designation. One hundred years ago it could not boast more than thirty cottages, raised ia 1773 by a shipbuilder named SVilson for the accommodation of his workpeople. If building operations at Folkestone and Sandgate proceed as rapidly as they have done during the last ten years, the last named place must, almost necessarily, become ab-orbod in the ancient borough aud modern port, of which it is, at this moment, a most attractive suburb. The township was created a separate ecclesi astical district iu 1851, when tho present church was built on the site of a chapel that had been erected by the fourth Earl of Darnley. Sandgate is greatly admired for the large nuniberof its charmingvillas. Close to the western end of the \" Broad way,\" or main street, is a substantially built life-boat station. Both the building and the boat were presented to the town, in 1876, by Miss Hannah Rothschild (the Countess of Rosebery), in memory of her father. A drinking fountain and cuttle trough was given by Lieut.-Colonel Wheatley. There is also a large coast guard station and a handsome block of almshouses \u2014 built in 1875 \u2014 forming part of the numerous charities with which the town is endowed. Sandgate lacks nothing wbich can aid in rendering it a desirable resort ; the local board have carried out a perfect system of main drainage, and there is a good supply of water from the Honywood springs. Sandgate castle is at the extreme eastern end of the town, and was built by Henry VIII. on the same plan as thoso ho established at Deal, Walmer, and Sandown, for the defence of the coas^. A castle must, \u2014 from the high road \u2014 discloses a, frag ment of ah elegant arch. Altogether, the ruins afford unimpeachable evidence that Saltwood, in the zenith of its history, ranked as one of the noblest of English \u25a0baronial halls. Tho public are admitted to view the ruins ou week days free of charge ; on Sundays tho interior is closed. Within five minutes' walk of the castle is the pretty village and church of Salt wood. The latter was erected chiefly in the reign of Edward III., and consists of a nave, chancel, north aisle, and square tower with five bells. It contains good Specimens of Norman work, and the east window is filled with stained glass, i depicting the four Evangelists. An oaken window-chest, of very curious and elaborate workmanship, is to be seen in the chancel, and there are several brasses, and an interesting oak font. The church is said to have been split from top to bottom by the earthquake of 1580. Visitors will scarcely fail to remark how thoroughly Saltwood represents the poetic ideal of an English country village. Tlie tree-shaded green iu the centre, the open forge on one side, and the rustic well on the other, supply these choice \"bits\" which delight the heart ofthe painter. The rectory gardens are de servedly admired, for here can be seen in the early summer some of the finest American plants and trees to be -found throughout the country. Immediately above these \" American Gardens \" is Hayne Wood, a high point overlooking Sandling Park, tho attractive seat of Bir. William Deedes, J.P., principal repre sentative of a family whose history is inseparable from that of Hythe. The mansion is a square brick building of noble proportions, and enclosed amidst beautiful grounds. Also in the imme diate neighbourhood is Brockhull Park, tlie ancient residence of Mr. William Tournay Tournay, J.P., and member of a family identified with the public life of Hythe for centuries. The estate is inherited direct from the Brockhull family, one of whom, Sir Warren de Brockhull, was seated here in the reign of Edward I. The present mansion was built in 1001 by Thomas Tournay. Close to the village (Saltwood) are the remains of the old hall. Area : 2,600 acres.

SANDWICH.-(STATION.) \u2014 A parliamentary and municipal borough of East Kent; a cinque port and market town, in the union and hundred of Eastry, lathe of St. Augustine, deanery cf Sand wich, and archdeaconry aud diocese of Canterbury. The distances by road are \u2014 68 miles from London, 12 from Canter bury, and 4 from Deal ; there is also water communication with London by means of hoys, and with neighbouring coast towns by small trading vessels. Sandwich derives its name from the sar.dy shore on which it is situated. It is a very ancient town, being referred to in one of the cbartularies of Canterbury Cathedral as early as the year 979, and Wilfrid, Archbishop of York, landed here in the year 665. The town and port rose into importance as the ancient town of Richborough decayed, from the re ceding of the sea, and became of so much importance that it was made one of the Cinque Ports by Edward the Confessor. Iu 1217 it was ravaged by the French. From the Conquest to Richard II. it was the royal port for the navy, and in the reign of Edward IV. had ninety ships. It was plundered and burnt several times by the French, ami was fortified aud walled by Edward VI., soon after which a ship sank at the mouth of the harbour, which became choked up with sand, and from that time its importance as a port declined. Sand wich has returned two members to Par liament from a very early period ; Deal and Walmer were included in the borough representation by the Reform Act of 1832. Sandwich was incorporated by Edward III. with a mayor and twelve jurats, who were ex-ojficio magistrates, and who were summoned to attend meet ings by a horn which was blown in the streets. The corporation as constituted under the Municipal Act adopted the Public Health Acts, -ind the borough has its own court of quarter sessions and police court. The gasworks belong to a company. Water is obtained from the Delph stream and private wells. A short distance from Sandwich is Richborough Castle, a massive building with walls twelve feet thick, erected in the reign of Vespasian, which has seen some hard service, and still survives in ruin, after an existence of nearly 2,000 years. Th ere is also a Roman amphitheatre in the neighbourhood. The old walls of the town have been converted into a prome nade, which, with the venerable Fisher's gate, are all that remain of the fortifica tions. The house where Queen Elizabeth resided in 1572, and a curiously carved house of the age of Henry VIII., are also still in existence. The castlo and tho four other gates have long disap peared. St. John's Hospital, dating from the reign of Edward I., St. Thomas's Hospital from the 16th century, and St. Bartholomew's from the 13th, still exist as charitable institutions. Among the other buildings there are \u2014 St. Peter's Church, an ancient structure of brick, with a stone tower ; St. Clement's, and St. Mary's. The Wesleyans, Indepen dents, and Baptists have chapels in the town. The Guildhall was built in 1539, the gaol iu 1830. There are also\u2014 a free grammar school, with four scholarships ; a national and other schools ; three hos pitals for the poor, a custom house, assembly rooms, (fee. From a very early period, until the choking up of tbe har bour, Sandwich flourished as a port ; it then declined until, by an Act of Parlia ment obtained in 1847, the harbour was improved, and trade consequently re vived. Its exports now are hops, malt, timber, and con. ; there are, besides, some tanneries and breweries, and ship building is carried on to some extent.

It is six miles north-west tion to Lady Margaret Boswell (temp. Chas. I.), enumerating her charities. St. John's is a district church, and there are several Nonconformist chapels. In 1450 Jack Cade defeated and slew Sir Humphrey Stafford, near Sevenoaks. Sevenoaks Vine cricket ground is to the north of the town, and adjoins Gallows Common, where criminals were executed in Elizabeth's reign. Sevenoaks is, however, chiefly noted for its con tiguity to the noble mansion of the from Tunbridge and eighteen miles west from Maidstone. The district is much favoured \u2014 on account of its healthy situation and picturesque scenery \u2014 by City merchants and others, and hand some villa residences are springing up in every direction. There aro gasworks and a capital water supply. The town was a busy spot ia olden times, it being in the direct coach road to the south-eastern"], [165, "125 Sackvilles \u2014 Knolo Park\u2014 on the south- east side of the town. It encloses an area of more than 1,609 acres, and is nearly six miles in circumference, of un- dul ating surface, m ost j udiciously planted, and abundantly timbered with spreading elms, stately beeches, and venerable oaks, some of which have attained enormous size ; besides which there are many parts of it that command delicious pros- pects of secluded woodland scenery, as well as of the more distant country, in- cluding the greater part of West Kent, with parts of Sussex and Hampshire. The mansion, which was begun by the Bigods, Earls of Norfolk, late in the fourteenth, and completed in the debased Elizabethan style \u2014 probably by the first Earl of Dorset \u2014 at the beginning of the seventeenth century, forms a spacious quadrangle, with similar ones behind it, covering altogether more than five acres of ground. It is built chiefly in the castellated style, with numerous square towers, and two embattled gateways or tower-portals \u2014 one leading to the outer, the other to the inner quadrangle. The first room we shall notice is the Hall, a noble apartment about seventy-five feet in length, including the screen, twenty- seven feet in breadth, and about twenty- six feet eight inches in height. At one end is a fine Grecian relic, in marble, of \"Demosthenes in the act of delivering an oration,\" which was purchased in Italy for seven hundred pounds. There are also several pieces of sculpture of great merit, and some pictures; one representing \" Dover Castle and the adjacent country,\" painted by Wotton, in 1727. The curious irons in the fire- place, on which are the arms and initials of Henry VIII., conjointly with those of Boieyn, were purchased at a sale at Hever Castle. The long oak table was constructed for the ancient game of shovel-board. The Brown or Horn Gallery is eighty-eight feet in length, and is chiefly filled with portraits of the Reformers and illustrious persons of the time of Henry VIII. On the right of this gallery is an appartment containing some excellent paintings and tapestry, and an oak bedstead of great antiquity. On the left of the gallery is the Spangled Bed Room, so called from the bed and furniture being covered with spangles. There is also some tapestry by Reydam, which, with the whole of the furniture in this room, with a few excep- tions, was presented by James I. to Lionel, fifth Earl of Middlesex, from whom it descended to the Sackville family. In the adjoining Dressing Room are several valuable pictures by the Old Masters, and others. The Billiard Room and Leicester Gallery contain some rare paintings by Vandyke, Holbein, Mytens, (fee. The views from the windows are highly pleasing, overlooking the pleasure- grounds. The Venetian Bed Room is so called from having been the sleeping apartment of Nicolo Molino, a Venetian ambassador. The State bed, with its green velvet furniture, was prepared for King James IL, who was expected to honour Knole with a visit, but did not arrive. In this and the ad- joining dressing room are some speci- mens of Domenichino, and others. The Organ Room is a rude-looking apart- ment, the walls being covered with oak, unpanelled. Here will be seen the remains of an organ said to have been the second made in England. It is placed so that the organist could observe the altar and officiating priests, while he himself, unseen from the chapel, per- formed the requisite music. There is an old oak chest here, grotesquely carved, which belonged to the travelling equipage of Lord Buckhurst, at the time when it was the custom to draw travel- ing chariots with teams of oxen. Ad- joining this room is the pew or gallery, looking down into the chapel, which preserves much of its original character, although the ceiling formerly panelled oak, is now a stuccoed imitation of vault- ing. There is a fine crypt beneath the chapel, with a vaulted roof. The chapel, cr Passage Room, is highly interesting. The walls are hung with tapestry, repre- senting, in compartments, the history of Noah, the building of the Ark, (fee. The most curious relics in this room are those upon the ancient chestnut cabinet. This is a group of figures, most elaborately carved, presented by Mary, Queen of Scots, a short time previous to her exe- cution, to the second Earl of Dorset. The subjects are \u2014 Christ's entry into Jerusalem, his Bearing the Cross, Taking down from the Cross, the Entombment. In one of the rooms, on the left of the entrance to the chapel, is a curious old"], [166, "126 chimneypiece, wHieh bears lire cog nizance of Archbishop Bonrchier. In the Ball Room are portraits, chiefly of the family, by Vandyke, Mytens, (fee. The Crimson Drawing Room contains several splendid paintings by Titian, Veronese, Vandyke, Teniers, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Lely, (fee. There is also a remarkably fine marble chimneypiece, and other curious objects. The Cartoon Gallery displays copies, by Daniel Mytens, of six of the cartoons of Raphael, and rare specimens by the Old Masters. The State Canopy, with its appendages, was used by the Duke of Dorset, when ambassador at the court of Louis XVI. The King's Bed Room is so called from having been pre pared for the reception of James I. It is splendidly fitted up. The walls are hung with tapestry, representing the life of Nebuchadnezzar. The State bed alone is said to have cost eight thousand pounds, and the entire fittings of the room upwards of twenty thousand pounds. The bedstead is richly orna mented, and the bed-hangings and fringed borders are of gold and silver tissue. Silver vases, baskets, urns, (fee, lie about in great profusion. The Dining Parlour contains upwards of sixty portraits of men distinguished in literature and science. There are some good specimens of paintings on glass, and a fine collection of busts, at Knole, principally collected in Italy by the last Duke of Dorset, on whose death, in 1829, the property came into the possession of the Countess of Plymouth, who, iu 1839, married Earl Amherst.

The village is prettily situated on tiie Wey. The parish church of St. Mary has undergone extensive restoration. Shal- ford House, the ancient family seat of the Austins, was built in the reigns of Queen Elizabeth and James I., by John Austen, Esq., on the site of the ancient manor house ; a carved oak chimney- piece, with the arms and various family impalements, is the only vestige now remaining to attest its antiquity. The building was modernized about 1760 ; it contains a fine collection of paintings by Rubens, Teniers, Anni- bale Carracci, Denner, Zachtleven, Poussin, and Vandermeulen, as well as some of a more modern school, by Fielding, Elmer, Moucheron, Kneller and Dance ; tho grounds adjoining this. house are very extensive.

Sliornclifl'c \u2014 so named, it is said, from the once bare character of the heights \u2014 was first utilised as a camp in 1806, when tbe light infantry tactics were introduced into the British army, by Sir John Moore (the hero of Corunna), and the old 95th regiment formed into the rifle brigade. The elevated site of the plateau commands extensive land and sea views, and its dry soil and bracing air has secured it an excellent reputation for salubrity,. and freedom from sickness of the troops stationed there \u2014 wliich usually compriso a battalion of the foot guards, three or four regiments of the line, two regi- ments of cavalry, detachments of the royal engineers and military train, as well as half-a-dozen batteries of the royal artillery. The camp consists of ranges of woodeu and iron huts; the"], [167, "127 soldiers' huts occupy the first two rows of each range, and the officers' huts and tho staff buildings comprise the third and fourth rows. Each range is calcu lated to accommodate a thousand men, aud the permanent barracks provide for the men and horses of two batteries of artillery. A commodious church is situate in the south-west angle, and there are reading rooms, billiard rooms, and fives courts. Near the church is a large iron tank on arches, surmounted by a clock ; it contains the water supply of the camp, obtained from the reser voir of the Folkestone Waterworks Company, at Cherry Gardens. The water is equally distributed throughout the entire range of buildings, supplying the huts from standards, as well as the ablution rooms and wash-houses, which are in every range. On the sea-face of the cliffs \u2014 sheltered from the north and north-east winds \u2014 is placed the general hospital, built in four terraces, rising one above the other ; lower down, towards Seabrook, is a hospital for women and children.

Southwark is an ancient borough appanage \u2014 for certain purposes only \u2014 of the Corporation of London. Surrey is one of the warmest and driest counties in England, and comprises many varie ties of soil. These include the cold clay, in a strip of the Weald, on the south border, 4 miles broad; a band of green sand near the Haslemere, Leith, and Reigate hills ; the chalk of the Central Downs, or Hog's Back ; and the clay loam and sand, near the Thames, with tracts of moor and heath, near Wimble don, Esher, Woking, Chobham. Leith Hill is 993 feet high, and overlooks an immense range of the Weald ; Botley Hill, near Croydon ; is 808 feet high ; Banstead Downs, 576 feet. The word Surrey is from the Saxon \"Suth-rise,\" meaning \" South Kingdom.\" Under the Romans this territory formed part of Britannia Prima. Subsequently it ap pertained to the Saxon kingdoms of Wessex, Mercia, and Kent. At the time of the Norman conquest, William de Warren was created Earl of Surrey, a title which continues in the possession of his descendants, the Dukes of Norfolk, whose heirs apparent are called Earls of Surrey.

TION.) \u2014 Sy denham is a metropolitan suburb and chapelry of the parish of Lewisham and county of Kent (western division) ; in Lewisham union and Greenwich county court and police dis trict. The chapelry is divided into several ecclesiastical districts, and there are numerous churches and chapels. Sydenham is, however best known by its connection with the world-famed Crystal Palace, which was budt with the materials of the Hyde Park Great Exhibition buildings of 1 851, and opened on the 10th Juno, 1854, by Her Majesty the Queen. The scheme and cost were undertaken by a public company, with a capital of \u00a3500,000. The building measures 1,608 feet in length ; the wings an additional length of 674 feet each, with a railway avenue of 720 feet ; the greatest width is 384 feet, and the general width 312 feet ; the height of the great transept from the basement is 197 feet 10 inches; the area of the galleries is 261,568 square feet, and that of the whole building is 603,072 square feet. Tho north wing of tho palace was burnt down on the 30th December, Hastings, and Rye], 21 urban sani tary authorities, 20 rural sanitary authorities, and 23 turnpike trusts. It also has two courts of quarter sessions (one for each division), and is divided into 18 petty sessional divisions, and 18 lieutenancy sub-divisions. The boroughs of Brighton, Chichester (city), Hastings, and Rye have commissions of the peace and separate courts of quarter sessions. All the boroughs above named have their own police, as also has the township of Hove, near Brighton. Pevensey, Seaford, and Winchelsea are municipal incorporations, not subject to the Municipal Corporations Acts. The South Downs, a range of chalk hills covered by fine turf, continuous with the Downs of Hants near Petersfield, traverse the county eastward to Beachy Head (564 feet high), where they termi nate on the English Channel in a lofty cliff. The upper greensand, the gault, and the lower greensand crop out from beneath the chalk on the north of the Downs ; the rest of the county consist ing of the Wealden clay and Hastings sands, with some occasional diluvial deposits ; the London clay appearing in the vicinity of Chichester, extending along the coast line from Selsey to Shoreham. The Romans included this county in Britannia Prima. It was afterwards part of the kingdom of Suth seaxe or the South Saxons (whence its name), founded by Ella in tbe fifth cen tury. The manufacturing interests are varied but not extensive. Gunpowder is made at Battle, and there is some amount of shipping on the coast.

Each tower contains 800 tons of iron ; the weight of the fountain water piping is 4,000 tons, and its length ten miles ; there are in all the fountains 11,788 jets, throwing 120,000 gallons of w-ater in a minute. The Palace has Fine Arts Courts representing the archi tecture, sculpture aud decorative arts of Egypt, Greece, Rome, Byzantium, as well as of the Medi\u00e6val, Renaissance, and early as well as late Italian. A great marine aquarium has been erected at the north end. There are, besides, in dustrial courts, picture gallery, fountains, flowers, and tropical plants and trees."], [171, "131 The park is laid out in a style of rich natural beauty, contrasting admirably with the mors artificial charms of the terrace gardens : they together occupy about 200 acres. Entertainments are given in the Palace almost daily through out the year, such as operas, grand, popular and classical concerts, magnifi cent displays of fireworks, displays of the terrace and great fountains, flower shows, natural history shows, and grand musical festivals of the highest class. In addi tion there are occasionally public recep tions or ceremonial visits of foreign Sovereigns, and many great class cele brations of national significance. On days when no special attractions are pro vided, the orchestral band of the Com pany usually performs. There are Schools of Art in connection with the Palace, which attract large numbers of students, both male and female.

TENTERDEN.\u2014 (Stations- APPLEDORE and HEADCORN\u2014 8 miles.) \u2014 A municipal borough of Mid Kent ; a market town, parish, and poor law union of eleven parishes, iu the hundred of Tenterden, lathe of Scray, deanery of Charing, archdeaconry of Maidstone, and diocese of Canteibury ; 55 miles from London, 10 from Rye, and 8 from Cranbrook. The sea at one period came up in a channel within three miles of the town, when it was a place of some importance, and was united to the Cinque Poi t of Rye. In the reign of Edward III. several refugee Flemings settled in the town and established the woollen manufacture, but it has long since died out. Tenterden was anciently one of \" the seven hundreds \" belonging to the crown, and endowed with peculiar privileges. It was incorporated by Henry VI. as the \"bailifl'and commonalty of the town and hundred of Tenterden,\" and re-incorporated by Elizabeth, under the title of \" the mayor, jurats, and commonalty,\" and the corporate body so continued until amended by tho Muni cipal Act. Tlie manorial rights are vested in the corporation. Considerable drainage works, for so small a town, have been executed. The town is also well supplied with water, and lighted by gas ; the latter works being in the hands of a private company. There is a cemetery outside the town, besides the churchyard, and a small burial ground attached to one of the dissenting chapels. The borough has its own police force. St. Mildred's parish church, with a lofty pinnacled tower, dating from the reign of Henry VI., was part of the monastery of St. Augustine. By an ingenious mode of expression \" Tenterden steeple\" is said to have been the cause of the Goodwin Sands, the funds for maintaining the sea-wall having been diverted for the erection of the steeple. There are the churches of St. Michael and St. John the Baptist ; chapels for the Wesleyans, Baptists, Calvinists, and Unitarians ; a town hall, corn exchange, workhouse for 400 inmates, assembly rooms, and sub scription library. Likewise a national school supported by funds from the grammar school founded by an ancestor of the Hayman family, and augmented in 1521 by Mrs. Marshall ; British and reformatory schools, &c. The trade of the place is of an almost purely local character. Market day : Friday. Fairs : First Monday in May (cattle); first Friday in September (lambs); Area: 8,869 acres. Population : 3,069.

TONB RIDGE.\u2014 (JUNCTION STATION.)\u2014 An ancient town, urban"], [172, "132 sanitary distriot, and large parish of the county of Kent (mid division) ; in the union, county court district and petty sessional division of the same name. Tonbridge may be described as consisting of one main street, run ning north and south in the line of the old coach road, nearly three-quarters of a mile long, with several minor streets branching from it, including some pretty terraces, squares, (fee, in the outskirts ; and at the southern end of the town runs the river Medway, divided into five streams, which are crossed by a corre sponding number of bridges. The prin cipal bridge, which spans the southern most of these channels, was built in 1775. The parish church is an elegant stone structure with a square tower, of modern erection, but containing some interesting monuments, especially one sculptured by Roubiliac. The town bas three other churches, of modern erection, and also three or four dissenting chapels ; there is a good national school. The glory of Tonbridge, however, is its Grammar School, which has for many years enjoyed high repute as a classical seminary ; it was founded in 1554 by Sir Andrew Judd, alderman of London, and is under the government of the Skinners' Com pany, who annually come down to examine the scholars. The revenues now exceed \u00a35,000 a year, and the head master receives a large salary, with a handsome residence. All boys resident within ten miles of Tonbridge are ad missible to the foundation ; besides which, there are others who pay a small quarterage. Tonbridge School has also cousiderableuniversity endowments, viz , a fellowship at St. John's, Oxford ; a scholarship of \u00a320 a year at Brasenose, Oxford ; sixteen open exhibitions of \u00a3100 per annum ; two exhibitions at Jesus College, Cambridge, of \u00a375 ; and ten minor exhibitions; all of which are fairly distributed according to merit. The buildings are very handsome, and well worthy of so important an institu tion. There are three exhibitions of \u00a3100 per annum, each tenable for four years, at either university. Tonbridge possesses no trifling interest for the antiquary in the ruins of its Castle, shown on Wed nesdays, from nine till four o'clock, by visitors presenting their cards at the lodge. This building, which is supposed to have been erected by Richard Earl of Cla.e, in the eleventh century, at one lime enclosed six acres of ground, and was surrounded by three moats ; but little now remains of it except the keep, small portions of the walls, and an inner gateway, said to be tho finest extant specimen of Norman architecture in this country. The fortress, however, is historically extremely interesting, as having been besieged by William Rufus in his contests with his brother of Nor mandy. It was captured by King John in his struggle with the barons ; and in the reign of Henry III., when it was besieged by his son Prince Edward (afterwards Edward I.), the town was burnt by tbe garrison, to check the approach of the Royal forces. It do volved to the Crown in the reign of Edward II. , and subsequently became the property of the Earls of Stafford, afterwards Dukes of Buckingham, until the attainder of the last duke of that family in 1521, when it again reverted to the Crown. Elizabeth gave it to her kinsman, Lord Hunsdon, from whom it passed to the Berkeleys, and from them to the Vanlores, the last of whom died, without male heirs, in the seven teenth century. Tonbridge Priory was founded in the middle of the twelfth century, for black canons, by Clare, the first Earl of Hertford; and was suppressed in 1526, among the smaller monasteries, at the instigation of Cardinal Wolsey, to whom it was granted by Henry VIII., in order to enlarge the endow ment of his college at Oxford. At what time it became disused, cannot be ascer tained ; most probably, however, at the Dissolution. In April, 1840, the last remaining vestiges, consisting of the great hall and the chapel, were pulled down for the South Eastern Railway In the town the visitor will find some quaint-looking old houses, which undoubtedly were of some consequence in former times. The population of the town depend on retail trade for the supply of the district ; though there are many independent families resident here for the purpose of enjoying the great educational advantages furnished by the Grammar School. The neighbourhood abounds with fine seats and pretty villas ; and there are few towns in England the environs of which f urnish such beautiful"], [173, "133 walks and drives as Tonbridge. Somer hill, once the property and residence of Sir Francis Walsingham, is a mansion pleasantly situated on the brow of a well-wooded eminence, about two miles from Tonbridge. It belongs to Sir Julian Goldsmid, Bt. From a turret in the court, on the north side of the house, are seen the Canterbury Hills, near Dover, at a distance of fifty miles. Four miles from Tonbridge, on the Maidstone road, is Hadlow Castle. An octagonal tower, ninety feet high, affords some magnificent prospects. Between Ship bourn \u2014 about five miles from Tonbridge \u2014 and Ightham,on the left, is the Moated House, in the occupation of the Selby family since the latter end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth. The house is situated in a dell, and contains a chapel, which is a rich treat for the antiquary. The hall is considered a fine specimen of the architecture of the fourteenth century. At Oldbury Hill, in this parish, are very considerable remains of a Roman entrenchment, the area of which is said to contain 137 acres : it is of an oval form, but is overgrown with wood. Two miles from Ightham is Wrotham, situated at the foot of the well-known chalk hills, from the summit of which some magnificent prospects are pre sented. There are remains here of an archiepiscopal palace, which was one of the residences of the Archbishops of Canterbury until the reign of Edward III. Very little of the palace remains beyond a part of the walls forming the the garden-wall of the \" Bull Inn,\" behind which the ruins are situated. At the bottom of Wrotham Hill is the \" Pilgrim's road,\" anciently frequented by devotees to the shrine of Thomas a Becket, at Canterbury. The only place of interest between Tonbridge and the \" Spa of Kent,\" is Southborough, the ancient possession of the Clare family, but which afterwards belonged to the Audleys and Staffords, from whom, by the attainder of Stafford, Duke of Buckingham, for high treason in 1521, it fell to the Crown, and was aiterwards purchased by Smith of Westenhanger, in whose descendants it remained till the commencement of the present century. Southborough was the resort of the Court during the reign of the Merry Monarch, for the purpose of drinking the waters of the neighbouring spa ; and the property commands most extensive views over this part of Kent.

TUNBRIDGE WELLS.\u2014(STA TION.) \u2014 A fashionable watering-place, urban sanitary district, and market town of the county of Kent (western division) ; it is comprised partly in the parishes of Tonbridge and SpeldhurBt, in Kent, and Frant, in Sussex, and is the head of a county court district and petty sessional division in the union of Ton bridge. The local government of the town being under the powers of a local Act, a police force separate from the connty is maintained by the inhabitants. Tunbridge Wells has high repute, a large permanent population, and is now of considerable standing as a fixed place of habitation. The valuable properties of the waters were known as early as the beginning of the seventeenth century, and Queen Henrietta availed herself of these healing springs, as well as the Queen and courtiers of the second Charles ; yet even so recently as only sixty years ago it was the custom, at the termination of each season, to close not only the hotels and boarding-houses, but even the Bhops and houses generally, till the approach of the following sum mer, the town being all but deserted during winter. Now all things have changed : rows of houses, estates of crescents, churches and new roads,occupy spots which were a few years since covered only with the heather. The Wells, indeed, is not a single place, but a district, comprising a series of scattered villages, mansions, and villas, within a circuit of three or four miles in diameter ; and the principal parts are named from the surrounding eminences, as Mount Ephraim, Mount Sion, Mount Pleasant, and the Wells proper : but by far the most beautiful quarter of this enchanting"], [174, "134 district lies to the north-east of the Wells proper and beyond Mount Sion. It is called, from having been formerly a private estate, Calverley Park ; nor can it be denied that the natural beauties derived from the variety of its surface, and the richness of its verdure and foliage, are much enhanced by the im provements of art, aud the erection of the pretty insulated villas that fringe its borders without destroying its park-like appearance. Few towns in the kingdom have increased with such rapidity. From a mere village, which it was a century back, the population, since it Was created a town, in 1835, and especially since the opening of the railway, ten years later, has progressed most remarkably. But the new buildings, numerous as they have been, have not been equal to the demand. The Local Improvement Acts have bad the effect of not only increasing yearly the list of fashionable visitors, but have now rendered Tunbridge Wells, like Brighton, a permanent place of residence to many persons whose daily occupations are in the metropolis, from the facilities of railway communication. The original village forms what is now called the Wells proper, where are the parade, the pump-room and baths, the leading inns, the libraries, and tbe assembly-rooms, with the principal shops, many of which are on a scale of extent and splendour that may vie with those of Bath or Cheltenham. Few places are better supplied with every kind of provisions. The town has several churches ; four tastefully built in the Gothic style, namely, Trinity Church, on Mount Pleasant, St. John's, St. James's, and Christ Chureh on Mount Sion ; and the church of St. Paul, Rusthall, which was built by subscription, and consecrated in August, 1850. The Roman Catholics have a handsome chapel built of stone, in the Grosvenor road ; and there are seven places of worship for different de nominations of dissenters. All the churches and chapels have their respec tive Sunday schools : besides which, the Victoria national schools, a female British school, and an infant school, furnish ample means of instruction for the poorer classes of the inhabitants. There are also religious and medical charities ; the poor, on the whole, being well cared for. There are literary societies, and a mechanics' institute. Good fishing may be obtained in the immediate neighbourhood of the Wells. The undulating character of the ground lends an additional charm, and the views from the several eminences are most beautiful. The old assembly-room on the Parade was pulled down some years ago, and houses erected on the ground. Butter, eggs, poultry and vegetables are brought into Tunbridge Wells daily from the adjacent villages; also fruit during the season. The old theatre was con verted into the corn exchange about fifteen years ago. A public hall was erected in 1870, at a cost of \u00a313,000 Half a mile up the Frant-road, is a largo estate, called Broadwater Down, com manding a most beautiful and extensive view. The commons of Rusthall and Tunbridge Wells are the property of the town. The town is well suppliod both with water and gas. Few country towns, indeed, have a cleaner, neater, and more orderly appearance than the Wells. As respects trade, it has none beyond that maintained by the wants of the district and neighbourhood. The only branch, too, of native industry which may be termed a manufacture, is the formation of boxes, spoons, domino-boards, and a variety of articles in wood of various colours, formed in mosaic, and familiarly known as Tunbridge-ware. \" The Grove\" was presented to the town in the year 1703, by John, Earl of Buckingham. Queen Anne subsequently gave the Basin, named the Well of the Queen, or Queen's Well. The same monarch gave the tiles for the pavement of the promenade, hence the word Pantiles. Richard Cum berland, the dramatist, resided at Grove House for nearly th irty years ; and at the end of his career the great states man, Lord North, came here to end his days. The precise period when the medicinal qualities of the mineral springs were discovered cannot be ascertained ; but they were, at any rate, greatly in vogue at tho latter pa rt of tho seventeenth century. These springs, which occur in the beds of iron- sand, first rise uorth-west of the town in the obscuro village of Speldhurst, and thence come down to the Wells, surging up at the lowest part of the narrow valley in which the original village was built. In 1664 Lord Mus kerry surrounded the spring with a stone"], [175, "135 wall; but this has since been wholly covered in by means of a handsome stone building. The water is a light, pure chalybeate, having a temperature of about 50\u00b0 Fahr. ; and its principal mineral ingredients are protoxide of iron, chloride of sodium, and sulphate of lime, in combination with carbonic acid gas. After all, however, the mineral constituents of these waters are very insignificant ; for Sir Charles Scudamore, who accurately analysed them, discovered little more than a third of a grain of the protoxide of iron, about a sixth of a grain of common salt, and a little more than a fifth of a grain of sulphate of lime, in a pint of water. However much, therefore, these waters may be valued for their virtues in cases of nervousness and dyspepsia, and however really beneficial they may be in female complaints, it is quite obvious that they have no claim to be compared for their active remedial qualities with those of Bath, Cheltenham, and Clifton. Its reputation stands, however, on quite independent grounds; for the beauty of the scenery in and around the Wells, the remarkable salu brity of the air, aud the agreeable society of the place, will ever continue to give it popularity, and make it not only a favourite summer resort, but an eligible spot for permanent residence. In every direction around the Wells are agreeable walks and rides, furnishing most exten sive views of rural and forest scenery. Perhaps the most favourite ramble for pedestrians is across the Common, on which are some curious rocks, known as the Sweeps' Rocks. At Rusthall Common may be seen another very extraordinary looking object, called the Toad Rock, which somewhat resembles in shape the Logan stones of Cornwall, and the form of which, it is evideut, could only have been produced by natural causes. The High Rocks, likewise, about a mile and a half to the west of the Wells, are ex tremely well worth a visit : they range between forty and seventy feet in height, are composed of sandstone, and have several curious caverns near them, which seem to have been rent asunder by some convulsion of nature. There are also several extremely delightful walks across the fields to Fraut Forest, Hall's Hole, Park Wood, (fee. Eight miles south of the Wells is Mayfield, in Sussex, con- taining the ruins of the Archiepiscopal Palace, which is said to have been built by St. Duustan, but there is probably no portion of the budding older than tho fourteenth century. Three miles from Mayfield is Heathfield, ouce noted for its manufacture of cannon. A battle was fought here in 633 or 635, between Cad- walla, a prince of the royal blood of Wessex, and Edwin, king of Northum- berland. Heathfield Park is built on an elevation of 600 feet above the level of the sea. Lamberhurst, eight miles from the Wells, is an interesting village. The church has a beautiful window in the west end, of the Perpendicular order. The pulpit, with the reading-desk, is of carved oak, and bears the date of 1630. A short distance from Lamberhurst are some vestiges of the once celebrated Gloucester Furnace, formerly the largest iron manufactory in Sussex, where the iron balustrade that encloses St. Paul's church-yard was cast. Two miles and a half east of Tunbridge Wells is Pem- bury, the church of which was built in the reign of Edward III. On a very ancient stone in the pavement of the chancel is an inscription in Norman- French, which appears coeval with the above-mentioned reign. Several memo- rials and monuments of the Amherst family are iu this church ; also a brass, dated 1007, near the altar. Goudhurst, twelve mUes from the Wells, contains a handsome church, enriched with several curious monuments to the Colepeper family of Bedgebury ; one in particular of Bethersden marble, on which are placed the recumbent figures of Sir Alexander Colepeper and his lady, carved in wood, habited in the costume of their times, the reign of Henry VIII. The knight's armour is richly carved. Market days ; Mondays (vege- tables) ; Fridays (corn). Population (town) : 19,410. Neiospapcrs : Tunbridge Wells Journal (l.), Thursday, ld.

WALMER.\u2014 (STATION on the Joint Line.) \u2014 A parish and suburb of the borough of Deal (forming part of the parliamentary borough of Sandwich), and county of Kent (eastern division) ; in Eastry union, Deal county court district, and Walmer petty sessional division. The Strand is the main street of Wal mer. At the end are the barracks. Walmer Castle (the official residence of the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports) is distant about half a mile from the vil lage, and is situated in a commanding and picturesque position. The building is as much modernized as its companion at Deal, and may be styled another of the ugly blockhouses of Henry VIII. ; it has been adapted to the convenience of a modern dwelling, and derives its chief importance from having been the frequent residence of the late illus trious Duke of Wellington, who died here in 1852. The rooms are mostly small and of no very symmetrical form ; abd they are connected by long, narrow, and circuitous passages. A door opens upon the ramparts from the \" Duke's Room,\" where the old warrior never failed, while at the castle and in health, to take his morning exercise at six o'clock. The moat has been converted into a kitchen garden. At the back may be seen Mr. Pitt's (when Lord Warden) plantation of sycamores ; here, too, are two shoots from Napoleon's weeping willow at St. Helena, planted by the Iron Duke. The view from this point is magnificent, being unbroken both north and south, while directly in front it is only bounded by the French coast. The barracks were erected in 1795, and consist of seven commodious brick buildings, covering an area of twenty-two acres. The first or north barracks are for infantry ; tho centre for cavalry ; and the third or south barracks for infantry. They are capable of accommodating 1,100 infantry and a troop of horse, and are considered very superior ouildings of their kind. The village is a very pleasant one, and the parish church has some points of archi tectural interest. It is believed that Walmer was the spot where Julius C\u00e6sar landed, 55 b.c, and again the following year, from the fact that it corresponds very closely with that warrior's descrip tion of the coast, in his \" Gallic War.\" Area: 1,019 acres. Population (includ ing military) : 3,816. WARLINGHAM. \u2014(STATION.) \u2014 A village and parish of the county of Surrey (eastern division) ; in Godstone union and Croydon county court district and petty sessional division.

It is also the ticket collect - ing station for Charing Cross. There is a local train service every five minutes between Charing Cross, Waterloo, and Cannon street, independently of the services beyond the last-named terminus. WELLINGTON COLLEGE.\u2014 (STATION.)\u2014 This station is in the parish of Sandhurst (see under that head), and county of Berks, and provides for communication with the Sandhurst Military College as well as the institution after which it is named. The Wellington College is the result of voluntary sub scription from all parts of the world, as a monument to the late Duke of Wellington. The subscriptions and interest on sums invested, together with \u00a325,000 from the Patriotic Fund, and \u00a33,000 from Sir J. Bailey, M.P., amounted to \u00a3159,000. In the appli cation of this sum, \u00a3105,000 were in vested on mortgage at four per cent., producing \u00a34,200 per annum ; the twelve acres of ground upon which the building stands were presented by Mr. Milner Gibson, M.P. ; the cost of the remaining land, 120 acres (since increased to 300 acres) was \u00a31,200 \u2014 therefore, the sum left for the building was \u00a352,800. The foundation stone was laid by tbe Queen in 1856, and it was opened by her in January, 1859. Tho College is designed for the education of 300 boys ; 80 orphan sons of officers of tbe Army or Navy being on the foundation. Tho instruction, besides the classics and the modern languages, includes all scientific knowledge bearing upon the arts, com merce, and the industry of the country. The building is in the south-east angle of Berkshire, at the junction of the county with Hampshire and Surrey. The iand is elevated heath ground, with extensive views towards Bagshot on the one side, and over the Hartford-bridge Flats on the other. Wokingham is seen to the north-west, and, beyond, the castle of Windsor. The view over Hampshire extends to Strathfieldsaye, the seat of the late Duke of Wellington. The building, which is in the Louis Quinze style, is flanked by two lofty towers, <nre to each of the two principal blocks of buildings, having a considerable effect of mass and altitude as seen from the surrounding country. _4\u00abcra</e Train Service : Eight each way on week day's ; two each way on Sundays.

WESTENHANGER. \u2014 (JUNC TION STATION).\u2014 This station is in the parish of Stanford and county of Kent (eastern division), and is the junction for the Hythe and Sandgate Branch line. About 300 yards north of the station, and close to the line, are the remains of Osten hanger, or Westenhanger Castle, a mag nificent mansion erected by Sir Edward Poyning (ante Henry VIII.) The manor of Wcstenhanger originally belonged to the Aubervilles, and thence passed by marriage to Nicholas de Criol, from whom it descended to Sir Edward with other property. Henry VIII. greatly enlarged the park and estate, and Queen Elizabeth stayed here in the course of one of her \" Progresses.\" She granted the castle and manor to Thomas Smythe (ancestor of the late Viscount Strangford), who farmed the customs of the Port of London. Mr. Smythe added greatly to the beauty of the mansion, and improved the grounds. The Finch family, who subsequently became the owners of the estate, pulled down a large part of the castle for the sake of the materials, and afterwards sold it to the Champney family. The plan of the building is still observable. The site was moated all round, and had a draw bridge, large gate-house, and portcullis; the outer walls were very high, and enor mously thick, embattled throughout, fortified by nine strong towers, alternately round and square, and having a gallery communicating from tower to tower. The castle is said to have contained \u2014 when Elizabeth visited it \u2014 12ii apart ments and 365 windows. Sir. Edward Poyming preserved, and incorporated in his work, one of the towers, which had. belonged to the old mansion of- the Criols. It is called \"Fair Rosamond's,\" from"], [178, "138 admitted into it by right of inheritance, taking up their freedom at the age of 21, unless disqualified by previous marriage : the freemen of the company share all its property and privileges; non-working members and widows re ceive one-third of a full member's share ; sick members receive within a fraction full pay. The town has a large trade arising both from its fishery and coal trade. The harbour is the property of the South Eastern Railway Company, and the line communicates with Canter bury.

WINCHELSEA.\u2014 (STATION.)- An ancient town and liberty, and one of the two ancient towns of the Cinque Ports, in the eastern division of the county of Sussex. It comprises the parish of St. Thomas the Apostle, and part of the parishes of Pett, Broomhill, and Icklesham, in the poor-law union of Rye. The parishes of St. Thomas and Icklesham form part of the parliamen tary borough of Rye. Winchelsea is distant 8 miles from Hastings. From being one of the most important of the southern ports, Winchelsea has dwindled down to a small coast town. The in roads of the sea have more than once destroyed its harbour. The first sub mersion of the old town occurred during a dreadful storm in 1250. In 1287 occurred the second and final submersion, which necessitated the removal of the inhabitants to a hill called Iham, in the parish of Icklesham, which was divided for building purposes into 40 squares of 2_ acres each, 39 of which can still bo traced. The court liberty is governed by a mayor and twelve jurats, in a like manner to the other old corporate mem bers of the Cinque Ports. The mayor and jurats are the magistrates, and they hold petty and general sessions of the peace. The selection of the mayor takes place annually on Easter Monday. Winchelsea returned two members to Parliament until the passing of the Reform Act of 1832, when it was dis franchised. The town now consists of one parish, viz., St. Thomas the Apostle. a tradition that this unhappy favourite of King Henry II. lived, or was confined Here before her removal to the labyrinth of Woodstock. The parts of the castle now remaining are the walls, and two towers, on the north and east sides, the cliapel, the principal entrance, and a portion of the garden walls ; but nearly all are in a very ruinous condition, and covered with ivy, or overgrown with trees. Westenhanger Castlo has shared the fate of Saltwood, Lympne, and other baronial halls in Kent and Sussex, and from being the gorgeous palace of monarchs, now serves the humble pur poses of a modern farm dwelling.

The district church of St. James, situated in the hamlet of Garlinge, is a gothic structure, erected in 1872. The locality has at tained a high repute for healthiness, and as a suburb of Margate the place is rapidly extending. Dent-de-lion (some times called Dandelion) hamlet possesses the remains of an ancient castellated mansion. WHIT STAB LE. \u2014 (TERMINAL STATION.)\u2014 A parish, town, and sea port of the county of Kent (eastern division) ; in Blean union and Canter bury county court district and petty sessional division. The two parishes of Whitstable and Sea Salter included in former times within their limit a borough jurisdiction known as \" Harwich,\" and remains which have been discovered give reason to the belief that the Romans had a settlement here. The place owes its modern importance to its celebrated oyster fishery, which is under the control aud management of an Incorporated Company of Dredgers, whose affairs are administered by a jury of twelve men chosen from their body. The company numbers about 424 members, who are"], [179, "WHITSTABLE BAY AND HARBOUR (FROM THE EAST)."], [180, "140 Thechurchesof St. Giles and St. Leonard have ceased to exist ; that of St. Thomas occupies one of the centre squares, and from its remains seems to have been a large and beautiful building : the chancel, which is spacious and lofty, is now used as the parish church ; the walls on the south and west are covered with ivy. There are stone and marble tombs, cauopied, to Gervase and Stephen Alard, admirals of the Cinque Ports, who died 1310 and 1330, and three altar tombs of the time of Edward I., called Crusaders or Knights Templars, one of whom is supposed to be a member of the family of Oxengridge.

WOKINGHAM.-(STATIOi_ .) \u2014 Wokingham (or Oakingham) is an ancient chartered market town aud parish of the county of Berks. It is in the poor-law union ofthe same name, the hundred of Sonning rural deanery of Sonning, archdeaconry of Berks, and diocese of Oxford. A portion of this parish was formerly in- cluded in Wiltshire, but by the Acts 2 & 3 William IV., cap 64, and 7 & 8 Viet., cap. 61, was included in Berkshire. The Staines and Wokingham branch of the South Western Railway at Staines gives access to London, and the South Eastern lino affords communication with the coast and all the stations on the Great Western Railway. Elizabeth first gave a charter of incorporation to Woking ham, in wliich she recited and confirmed privileges long enjoyed by the inhabit ants, but the governing charter is one granted by James I., in 1612. The corporate body consists of an alderman, seven capital burgesses, and twelve sec ondary burgesses, with officers. General and patty sessions are held, but the court of record has been discontinued for nearly two centuries. The alderman is elected annually on the Wednesday in Easter week, and he, and his immediate predecessor, the high steward and the recorder, are town magistrates by virtue of their offices. The public health is attended to by a local board appointed in 1874. The town occupies an elevated situation within the ancient limits of Windsor Forest, and consists of several irregularly-built streets, meeting iu a central spot, used as a market place. The parish church of All Saints, an old and handsome structure, was thoroughly restored in 1864. A portion of the parish is constituted a separate district for ecclesiastical purposes, and John Walter, Esq., M.P. (whose estate \u2014 Bear- wood \u2014 is about two miles distant), has built a church (St. Paul's) for the new district, at his own cost. The church, consecrated July 23, 1864, is in the Dec- orated style of the llth and 15th centuries. There is a National school for boys and girls, also St. Paul's mixed school for boys and girls, and an Infant school. Wokingham contains places of worship for Baptists and Wesleyans. Tn the centre of the town stands a block of buildings, consisting of the Town Hall, Market House, and Police station, erected at a cost of \u00a33,500, on the site of the old Town Hall. Wokingham is endowed with many charities, amongst them being a bequest by Archbishop Laud, of \u00a350 per annum, to be expended every third year in portioning poor maidens, and the other two years in apprenticing boys of the parish.

WOOLWICH\u2014 (Two STATIONS \u2014ARSENAL and DOCKYARD.) \u2014 A populous town, urban sanitary district, and parish, forming an important part of the parliamentary borough of Green- wich, in the county of Kent (western division) ; it is in the union of the same name, the Greenwich and Woolwich county court and police court districts, and the jurisdictions of the Metropolitan Police, and Central Criminal Court, and London School Board. The best view of the Dockyard is obtained from North Woolwich. Here can be observed the sea-wall extending from Charlton to the lower part of the town ; in the distance"], [181, "141 may be seen the numerous shipping in the river. At an early period, the natural capabilities of Woolwich were deemed admirably adapted for tbe con struction of vessels ; tbe river at this part being nearly a mile across, and deep enough to float vessels of large burthen within a very short distance of the shore ; and, accordingly, in the reign of Henry VIII., a royal dockyard was first established here, in which the well-known \"Harry Grace-a-Dieu \" was built in 1515. It was not, however, until the reign of Elizabeth that the dockyard became cf any importance. It was here tbat most of tho ships cele brated in the victories of Drake and Hawkins, and in the voyages of Drake and Frobisher, were launched. It was in the reign of Charles I., after the dockyard had been greatly enlarged, and the interior economy much im proved, that the \" Sovereign of the Seas\" was constructed. She was registered for 1,637 tons, and was considered, at that period, of extraordinary dimensions. The dockyard increased as the import ance of the navy became more apparent, and at the present time it is of consid erable extent. It commences at the village of New Charlton on the west, and extends nearly a mile along the banks of the river to the east, at which part it closely approaches the Arsenal. There are docks capable of containing the largest men-of-war. On the side of the basin is a magnificent dock, one of the largest in the kingdom, formed of the finest granite. This dock is used for building or fitting up the largest de scription of war steamers. The ill-fated \" Royal George \" was built in these docks, and launched in 1751. The foun dry and boiler- maker department is upon the most extensive scale, and engines of the most powerful description are now made and fitted to the largest steamers. Piles of cannon shot are scattered about in immense quantities, with anchors and large pieces of wide-mouthed ordnance ; while the quick puffing of steam blowing off, the vomiting of dense smoke in huge black rolling columns, the glow of furnace fires, and the sound of a thou sand hammers busily at work, tell of those vast triumphs of mechanical in genuity by which bars of iron are twisted with the ease and lightness of a silk ribbon. Each department of the dock yard is under the superintendence of a separate officer, the whole being under the direction of the Board of Admiralty. A commissioner, the master-attendant, the storekeeper, and the principal officers of the other departments, reside on the spot, houses having been erected for their accommodation. The Arsenal is a few steps from the dockyard gates. This building is surrounded by huge brick walls of large circumference, and with a massive entrance, opening on a wide gravelled space, the ranges of buildings and houses within appearing almost like a town in themselves. Right and left of the gateway is a lodge, in one of which visitors are handed over to an official, who enters in a book their names, residences, and designations. The three manufacturing departments into which the Woolwich Arsenal is divided, are as follows : \u2014 Tbe Royal Gun Factory, the Royal Carriage Department, and the Royal Laboratory Department. The Shell Factory is entered by folding gates of a remarkably chaste and beau tiful description. They are formed of ornamental cast-iron work and wrought iron bars, the whole fitted into a massive wrought-iron frame. The gates are highly ornamented, and contain, among other devices, admirably executed, the monogram V.R., in a circle, and the royal arms beneath, with the date of manufacture, 1856. Near the foundry is the Pattern Room, a building in which is deposited a pattern or model of every article used in the artillery service. Connected with the pattern room is the Laboratory, in wbich the cartridges, rockets, fireworks, and other articles of chemical construction used in the service are prepared. Proceeding to the north, the extensive range of storehouses of the Royal Artillery is approached. In these repositories there are generally kept complete outfittings for 10,000 horses, and frequently there are sufficient articles for 20,000 cavalry. These objects include saddles (arranged in heaps on tbe sides of a room nearly 300 feet long), horses' bits, pistols, swords, horse-shoes, whips, (fee. From the upper part of these warehouses the whole area ofthe arsenal may be seen, together with the immense tiers of cannon in the field immediately below. The Chapel in Woolwich Ar-"], [182, "142 school. The whole building is arranged for the accommodation of from 3,000 to 4,000 men. On the Parade in front of the grand entrance to the barracks, stand five large pieces of ordnance, mounted upon handsome bronzed car riages. The centre gun, \" a fine speci men of Oriental manufacture,\" was taken at the siege of Bhurtpoor. Across the road which leads along the west end of the barracks, stands a park of guns, mounted on carriages ; here the recruits of the Royal Artillery are exercised. The Garrison Church contains five apse windows, illustrating the petitions in the Litany. At the Royal Military Repository is a regularly-constructed fort, with guns peeping from the embra sures. Here the gunners and drivers of the Royal Artillery practise the art of defending fortifications ; and on the lake,. floating bridges are thrown upon pon toons ; and other processes of war are carried on in strict exercises. The Rotunda is not improperly termed, the great national military curiosity shop. The singular shape and pictutesque appearance of the building strike the attention ; nor will the eye wander un pleased down the precipitous slope on which it is erected, with the distant view of Woolwich, the river, and the flat lands of Essex. The Rotunda was originally a banqueting room, designed by Nash, and put up in Carlton Gardens for the reception of the Allied Sove reigns; it is now a depository for military and naval models. Its twenty-four sides, the one light, slender pillar in the cen tre, piled all round with curious arms, shields, helmets, and guns, of a rare and ancient description, present a grand vista to the visitor on his entrance. Its form is a regular polygon, having a dia meter of 120 feet, with the roof ascend ing in tho form of a cone to more than 60 feet. In the centre, tastefully ar ranged around the pillar, are old English weapons, as the ancient matchlock, the wheel- lock, two-handed swords, early cannon, shields, bills and partizans, &c, together with many trophies from foreign powers. Above these is a beautiful suit of armour, said to have belonged to the chivalric Bayard, the knight \" sans peur et sans reproche.\" Near the walls are exhibited many other articles of a similar description, consisting of the senal was opened for divine service in February, 1863. From the top of the hill beyond the Ordnance Hospital, a magnificent picture presents itself to our gaze. The noble mass of buildings comprised in the Royal Artillery bar racks nearly a quarter of a mile in length ; their fine elevation ; the splen did level of the parade, in front of the whole range ; the field of guns on the west, and the Royal Military Repository at its end ; as a background, the beauti ful hanging woods of Charlton, and a distant view of London; on the south, inclining to the west, the far outspreading common, stretching to the horizon ; again, on the south, inclining to the east, is the Royal Mihtary Academy, while majestically, to form a background in this direction, lie the romantic and ver dant slopes, tending upwards to the darkly- wooded summit of Shooter's Hill : to the east and north-east extend, like a panorama, the low grounds of Kent and Essex, through which flows the Thames, studded with many a moving sail. It would be difficult to conceive a more magnificent serie3 of views than are here presented. The barracks for the Royal Artillery are situated to the north of Woolwich Common. Tho principal front, extending above 1,200 feet, consists of six ranges, connected by four buildings thrown a little behind, and by as many covered ways or colon nades of the Doric order, surmounted with balustrades. Two cupolas, the one containing a clock, the other a wind dial, ornament the summit of the building and break the uniformity of the line. In the eastern wing i6 a spa ciou3 and elegant chapel. The other principal parts of the building are the library and reading-room, and the mess room, 60 feet in length. This latter room is connected with two others, the drawing and ante-rooms, which together form a handsome suite of apartments, in which balls and entertainments are sometimes given by the officers. From the principal entrance, an avenue, 220 yards in length, terminated by a gate way at the northern portion of the barracks, divides the building into two quadrangles, by the sides of which are the stabling and barracks for the Horse Artillery ; and at the extremity of the east quadrangle is a spacious riding-"], [183, "143 arms and costumes of the North American Indians, tho South-Sea Island ers, &c. ; rockets of every variety, models of bombs, (fee. There are models of foreign artillery, and a splendid matchlock taken from Tippoo Saib at Seringapatam. In the body of the room are models of forts, cities, and dockyards, including a splendid model of Gibraltar. The Royal Military Academy is situated on the south-eastern edge of Woolwich Common, towards wbich it presents an imposing fapade, and the appearance of its turrets from a distance is extremely picturesque. This Academy was estab lished in the Royal Arsenal as early as 1718; but the accommodation at the commencement of the present cen tury being found insufficient, a new situation was chosen, and the present building erected in 1805. It is a spacious pile, partly in early English and partly in tlie Elizabethan style. A large tower in the centre, surmounted by four cas tellated turrets, with octagonal domes, is the principal feature in the building. This is connected with the wings by a castellated colonnade or arched recess. The main entrance, a simple archway, is approached by a long avenue from tbe north, whence the wooded heights of Shooter's Hill may be perceived, rising in the distance to the left of the building. The town of Woolwich is built in a healthy situation on the north declivity of Shooter's Hill, to the side of the river. A small portion of the town, called North Woolwich, is on the Essex side of the Thames. The houses in that part of Woolwich, whieh may be considered the principal street, are of ancient appearance, occasionally inter spersed with substantial and well-built dwellings. The upper part of the town, towards the Common and the Charlton road, contains several ranges of well built and handsome modern houses. The numerous stirring military displays, and the number of vessels daily passing on the river, give it an animation and permanent interest superior to any other town in the kingdom. The parish church, dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene, situated on an eminence overlooking the dockyard and the river, is a brick building, with a square tower,ornamented with copings aud cornices of stone ; the interior \u2014 in which several standards taken in war are deposited \u2014 is lofty and well arranged. The galleries are sup ported on Ionic columns of good pro portion ; there are few monumentsof any celebrity. In the churchyard are numerous mortuary records to officers of the Royal Artillery. Besides this church, there aro other sacred edifices : St. John's, situated in Wellington-street, a neat stone structure wish lancet-shaped windows ; St. Thomas's, consecrated in 1850 ; and Holy Trinity, in Beresford Street ; and Mission Chapels. There are also the Garrison and Ordnance Chapels, and several places of worship for Dissenters and Roman Catholics. The means of education are well pro vided ; there are also some excellent charities, Shooter's Hill, on the south side of the Common, has already been alluded to as having been formerly cele brated for the robberies committed there ; and its reputation was so ancient, that Phillpott, who wrote in the time of James I., says, \"They continue still to rob here by prescription.\" The widening of the road, and the great increase of popula tion in the neighbourhood dispersed the \" night gentry,\" and the place is now studded with handsome villas and sub stantial mansions.

Leith Hill, the highest elevation in the south-east of England, is in this parish. Upon one of its points, Mr. Richard Hull, the owner of Leith Hill Place, built a tower in 1766, whence"], [184, "144 the sea is visible through an opening in the South Downs. Mr. Hull was, by his own particular desire, buried in this tower. For many years after the build ing of the tower it was open to the public; the privilege, however, was thought to be abused, and it was said that the tower had become a harbour for vagrants and smugglers ; so about the years 1795 or 1800 the entrance door was built up, and the whole in terior of the tower filled with stone and cement, and it was in this state a few years ago when the tower and land adjoining were purchased by W. J. Evelyn, Esq. So solid was the cement that it was found impossible to re-open the old entrance and interior staircase, therefore a staircase tower was built by the side of the old tower, iu order to make the building available for its original purpose, of viewing the fine prospect ; the tower commands exten sive views over portions of Surrey, Sussex, Hants, Berks, Oxford, Bucks, Herts, Middlesex, Essex, Kent, and, by the aid of a glass, Wilts. Wotton House, the seat of the Evelyns, is a large and irregular building, chiefly interesting as having been the birth place of John Evelyn, the celebrated author of \" Sylva,\" who was born October 31, 1620. The mansion is pleasantly situated in a valley sur rounded by plantations ; the library was built in 1864 on the site of the west wing (destroyed by fire about 1800). Among the family relics are three por traits of John Evelyn. In the picture gallery are placed tlie most interesting of the pictures of John Evelyn's collec tion ; and here is preserved the prayer book used by King Charles on the scaffold, which was presented by Arch bishop Juxon to Sir Richard Brown, father-in-law to John Evelyn.

Wye is celebrated as having once been a royal manor, and granted by the Conqueror to the Abbey of Battle, to which it belonged till the Dissolution, when it reverted to the Crown ; it was subsequently granted by Queen Eliza beth to Lord Hunsdon, but at the close of the seventeenth century to tho Finches, whose present representative, the Earl of Winchelsea, is lord of the manor. Wye boasted also of a monastic college, founded in the middle of the fifteenth century, by John Kempe, Cardinal Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Chancellor of England, and which was much frequented by students down to the Reformation, when it was sur rendered to the Crown. The remains of it, which aro sufficients extensive to indicate its former importance, form a large quadrangle, built round an open court ; but though the lower part is of stone, iu the pointed style of architec ture, tbe general effect ha3 been spoiled by modem brick additions in tho upper 3torey. The old hall, a large vaulted apartment, is now a schoolroom, and the ancient commons-room has become a kitchen ; the cloister in the inner court is modern. Some of the windows, how ever, in the southern part of the college show traces of having been richly orna mented with stained glass, which are marked with the arms of the founders, Edward IV. and Edward VI. The college is still used as a grammar-school. The town, which stands close to the river Stour (crossed here by a stone bridge), consists of a couple of well built main streets. Tlie church of St. Gregory aud St. Martin, in its original state, was a large and handsome build ing, and was erected by Cardinal Kempe, when he founded the college above mentioned. It fell into a dilapi dated state until 1701, when it was repaired. The present edifice is a neat stone building, consisting of a nave, aisles, and one circular chancel, which contains numerous memorials, including one to Lady Joanna Thornhill, a liberal contributor to the charities of Wye. In the neighbourhood of Wye aro several family seats. On the banks of the Stour is OUantigh, a fine mansion, sur rounded by a park of about 600 acres. On the same river, also, is Godmersham, a pretty rural village, in a fertile dis trict ; and close to it is Godmersham House and Park. There are also Wye Court, Withersden, Cold Harbour, Wil mington, Marriage, Hermitage, and Pickersdean. Fair ; Annually on Oc tober llth. Area .\u2022 7,282 acres. Popu lation : 1,620.

YALDI N G.\u2014 (STATION.)\u2014 A village and parish of tbe county of Kent (mid division) ; in Maidstone union, county court district, and petty sessional division. The parish church, a Gothic structure, situate about one mile on the east side of the station, is dedicated to St. Peter and St. Paul ; the vicarage is about half a mile beyond ; a moat runs round the house and gardens. There is also a district church in this parish. St. Margaret's Church National schools were built in 1857, for boys and girls. There is a free Grammar school for boys, open to the children of any parishioner. There are also six alms houses, the gift of Miss Simmons. A branch of the river Medway runs through this parish. Barges of forty or fifty tons reach here via Rochester and Maidstone. At Yalding Lees Pasture there is a cricket-ground, beautifully surrounded with elm and chestnut trees. On the east side of the line, between Yalding and Watering bury, is the seat called Kenward. A splendid view of the surrounding country may be had from tho hills. Area : 5,843 acres.

THE PRINCIPAL CITIES AND TOWNS ON THE THROUGH ROUTE FROM AND TO CALAIS AND BOULOGNE AND PARIS. ABBEVILLE.\u2014 A cathedral town of the department of La Somme aud a principal station on the Northern of France Railway. It is situated in a fer tile valley, about three miles broad, and is well built. The public edifices include a commercial college, a school of design, hospitals, public libraries, &c. The Chateau d'Eau in the neighbourhood was the favourite marine residence of King Louis Philippe. The Somme intersects the town, forming a small island on which the principal part of Abbeville is built. Three small affluents of the Somme likewise flow through the town, so that a large number of bridges aro required to facilitate the communi cation. The ramparts, which are flauked with bastions and surrounded by broad ditches, form an agreeable promenade. There is a considerable commerce in corn, oil, linseed, and hemp, by means of the Somme, which is navigable up to the town at high water, by vessels of 150 tons. There are also extensive manufactories of woollen cloths, &c, cavalry and infantry barracks. The principal attraction of Abbeville is the cathedral, dedicated to St. Wulfran. The building is of ancient date, but was reconstructed in the sixteenth century. The date of 1513, inscribed in the roof of the choir, establish^ the date of this restoration. One of the great charms of the edifice is its picturesque irregularity, and the profusion of beautiful sculptures, also the numberless niches and statues with fretwork and carving which en counter the eye everywhere. A square tower rises on each side of the gateway, each richly ornamented. The interior of the cathedral is very striking, despite the tawdry tinsel which covers the altars. The altar of St. Wulfran was for several centuries the object of peculiar venera tion. It was here that an oath, or probe test, was administered to individuals suspected of having robbed their neigh bours, and to the workmen employed in the Mint, in order to keep them honest. There are few remains of antiquity in Abbeville except this church ; and tho"], [186, "146 prison, composed of portions of the castle, formerly belongiug to tbe Counts of Ponthieu, which was so splendid as to be the pride of Picardy. The three celebrated geographers of the seven teenth century, Philip Briet, Peter Duval, and Nicholas Sanson, and the poet Millevoye, were natives of Abbe ville. The population is nearly 18,000. The battle-field of Agincourt is distant from Abbeville about seven miles. Both Agincourt and Crecy are reached by diligences. Abbeville was occupied by the Germans ia 1871. Principal Hotels : De France ; Du Commerce ; and Tete de B\u0153uf. building, such as can bo nowhere ex celled. The stalls in the choir are richly carved, and represent the principal personages and events in the Holy Scriptures ; the stained glass win dows are among the finest that France contains. In one of tho towers, a small chamber is shown where, according to tradition, Henry the Fourth posted himself to watch the movements of the Spanish army. The steeple, which is 201 feet from its base to the summit, and 402 feet from the ground, was the work of a common carpenter. The en tire length of the Cathedral is 442 feet, and its vault is half as high again as the roof of Westminster Abbey. \" The interior is one of the most magnificent spectacles that architectural skill can ever have produced. The mind is filled and elevated by its enormous height (140 feet), its lofty and many-coloured clere story, its grand proportions, and its noble simplicity. The proportion of height to breadth is almost double that to which we are accustomed in English cathedrals ; the lofty, solid piers, which bear up this height, are far more massive in their plan than the light and graceful clusters of our English churches, each of them being a cylinder with four engaged columns. The polygonal E apse is a feature which we seldom see, and no where so exhibited and on such a scale ; and the peculiar French arrangement which puts the walls at the outside edge of the buttresses, and thus forms in terior chapels all round, in addition to the aisles, gives a vast multiplicity of perspective below, which fills out the idea produced by the gigantic height of the centre. Such terms will not be con sidered extravagant when it is recol lected that the vault is half ashigh again as the roof of Westminster Abbey.'' \u2014 Whewell. The city is situated on the river Somme, at an altitude of 400 feet above sea-level. It is the see of a bishop, who is a suffragan of Rheims, and whose diocese comprises the department of the Somme. It is also the seat of a Court of Assize, a tribunal of commerce, a school of medicine, an imperial college, an academy of science, and possesses several normal schools, a public library, and botanical garden. The weaving of cotton-velvet, and spin ning of cotton and woollen yarns, form AMIENS. \u2014 A large city and forti fied town of the department oiLa Somme, and the principal station on the North ern of France Railway in connection with the English mail and tidal routes to and from Paris. Line3 branch off here, from the main road, in every direction. The Cathedral, one of the most magnificent churches in Europe, is raised upon the ruins of an ancient temple which was destroyed by light ning. The present edifice was com menced in 1220, and finished fifty years afterwards. The exterior of the Cathe dral is distinguished by much grandeur and beauty ; the decorations of the en trances, the elaborate sculptures and tracery work, the majestic proportions of the supporting towers, altogether strik ing the eye with marvellous eflect. But it is the interior which commauds the greatest admiration. Three vast and deeply recessed portals lead into it, the arches supported by a long array of statues in niches instead of pillars, while rows of statuettes supply the place of mouldings, so that tbe whole forms one mass of sculpture ; an arrangement of constant occurrence in French Gothic, though rare in English. The sculpture of these porches merits attention ; over the centre door the bas-relief represents tbe Last Judgment, the statues are those of the twelve Apostles. Over the right hand porch are the Death and Assump tion of the Virgin ; over that on tbe left is the legend of St. Firmin, the apostle of Picardy. Above the portals runs a colossal line of French kings, behind which appears a noble wheel-window. The nave is a perfect chef c ' we of Gothic art, and the view of the whole"], [187, "147 the principal manufactures of the place. Amiens was anciently the capital of Picardy. In the time of Julius C\u00e6sar, it was called Samarobriva, and it was here that Valentinian proclaimed his son Gratian by the title of Augustus. Amiens has been the scene of great his torical events in ancient and modern times. It was taken by the Spaniards in 1597. The stratagem by which the Spanish general gained possession of tbe place is curious and well known. He caused a cartload of nuts to be over turned at one of the gates ; and, while the guard was scrambling for the fruit, he rushed into the town with a chosen body of men which he had placed iu ambush. The fortress was soon after retaken by Henry IV. It was here that the celebrated \"Treaty\" of 1802 was concluded between Great Britain, France, Spain, and the Batavian re public. The city wears a business aspect, and contains numerous manufac tories of beet-root sugar, soap, tanneries, and paper-mills ; atao dyeing, bleaching, and chemical works. Pates de canards are made here in large quantities. Among the most striking public build ings are the Chateau d'Eau, the Palais de Justice, the Hotel de Ville (built by Henry IV.), the Corn Market, (fee. Leading from the Boulevarde Fontaine is the Grande Rue de Beauvais, answer ing to the once existent gate. Turning down this, the visitor will see a vast building of plain exterior, but covering an immense area of ground. This is the Hospital for Deserted Children. On the Boulevard St. Jacques, is a vista of thickly-planted trees, the pride of the city, and called the PromeiW.de de la Hotoie. In the heart of the town is a handsome Marche aux Herbes, or covered fruit and vegetable market. There is a large Theatre at Amiens, in the principal street, the Rue des Trois Cailloux. Not far from the radway station is the Place St. Denis, a neat little square with a central statue, and bordered by rows of acacias. The Abbey of St. Acheul, on the outskirts of the town, was converted into a Jesuits' college under the Restoration. The. crypt under the church contains some ancient tombs and bas-reliefs. Estimated population: 50,000. After the defeat of the French army of the North in 1871 by General Manteuffel, the Germans occupied Amiens. Princi pal Hotels : De France et d'Angleterre ; Du Rhin ; and De l'Uuivers. BOULOGNE\u2014 (generally styled BOULOGNE-SUR-MER, to distinguish it from Boulogne near Paris). \u2014 Thi3 town, seaport and tidal packet station, is in the arrondissement of the same name and in the D.partement of the Pas-de- Calais. The harbour is formed in the channel of the Liane, with the addition of a semi-circular basin on the left bank of the river, which was originally dug to contain Napoleon's celebrated flotilla, intended for the invasion of England. The increasing importance of Boulogne required that this basin should be im proved and rendered serviceable for merchant vessels of considerable tonnage. In the year 1860, the works for deepen ing and forming a large floating dock were commenced, and are extremely commodious, being sheltered from tem pestuous gales, the high grounds on each side of the Liane forming a natural protection from the north-east and south, whilst an artificial barrier has been raised to protect the shipping from tho west, on the summit of which is placed a battery. The railway has a branch line alongside the harbour, by which passengers alight from the trains to the boats, and vice versa. The entrance to the harbour is bounded by two jetties : that to the west is solid up to the level of high water, and is thrown out along the lino of the rocky shore a length of 1,970 feet ; the other, to the east, runs directly out to tiie sea ; and the bottom of the intervening channel is 230 feet in width. Spring-tides rise 24 feet, and neap-tides 17 feet ; but when it blows from the west, the springs rise 28 feet, and the neaps 19 feet. The French Government having resolved to construct a deep sea harbour at Boulogne, the necessary works were commenced in 1879. This gigantic undertaking, by which in a quiet and unpretentious way France is securing on her northern coast the possi bility of a naval station that shall be one of the finest in the world, is under taken by the Government of the Re public. Tbat it will, when completed, entirely revolutionise the inter-com municate* 'iof England and France, is a consideration of prime importance to"], [188, "148 Nelson on the 15th August, 1801, and by Admiral Keith, August 10th, 1804 ; but, on the defeat of the combined French and Spanish fleets in 1805, the camp at Boulogne was broken up, and the troops were marched to the Rhine. The manufactures of Boulogne consist of ropes, fishing -nets, leather, bricks, linen and woollen stuffs, pens, crino lines, and bottles. The town carries on an active trade in fresh and salt fish, of which vast quantities are transported to Paris. Boulogne consists of two towns, au upper and a lower ; the former is the older portion, and occupies the summit of a hill ; it is encircled by ramparts with arched gateways, and has an old castle at the east angle, divided from the town by a fosse ; the ramparts rise from 15 to 20 yards above the level of their base, and are surmounted by two rows of trees, forming a most delightful promenade. The high and low towns are connected by means of a steep street, called La Grand Rue. The favourite locality of the English is in the modern part, called Tintifieries, which lies in a valley towards the north. The Haute Ville, or Upper Town, contains the Hotel de Ville, or Town Hall, built on the site of the ancient palace of the counts, the birthplace of Godfrey de Bouillon, Tbe Belfroi, behind the Hotel de Ville, is one of the most ancient buildings in Boulogne; tbe tower, 140 feet high, affords a magnificent prospect from its summit of the town and the surround ing country. The Palais de Justice, or Court House, is also situated in the upper town, together with the Church of Notre Dame, raised chiefly by the exer tions of the AbbiS Haffreingue. It is built on the site of the ancient Cathedral of Boulogne, covering an extensive crypt, which merit3 the interest and admira tion it universally obtains. On the 1 5th of August, every year, and for 14 subsequent days, pilgrimages to tha shrine of Notre Dame de Boulogne draw together a great number of devotees from all parts of France to this church. The castle, long the residence of the military governors of the Boulonnais, is now au ordnance magazine aud military prison. In the Rue du Chateau is the abode where the immortal author of Gil Bias (L\u00ab -Sage) died. Passing out at the Porte Gayole, and continuing to the left the travelling public. But, at the samo time, and without detriment to this object, it is clear tbat France will have here a magnificent harbour in which all her fleet can safely lie at anchor. The harbour will cover an area of 800 acres, and steamers will be able to approach the jetty in 27 feet of wafer at low tide. This enclosure is to be completed by two breakwaters running far out into the sea, tbe longer one being in the shape of an arm bent at the elbow, and so encir cling the harbour on two sides. The works are necessarily of the most massive construction, and, like Rome, the har bour may not be built in a day. It is now, however, in full progress ; and when a certain stage is reached, the English interests (represented by the South Eastern Railway Company) have undertaken to build corresponding works on their side, though, of course, not on the same large scale. The object of the South Eastern Company is to create the possibility of making the journey from London to Paris in eight hours, by a fixed service independent of the tide. These harbours, navigable from either side in any state of the tide, will make this hitherto unapproachable design a matter of course. With deep sea harbours even larger vessels than those now owned by the South Eastern will become possible, and the horrors of the Channel passage will practically be annihilated. Boulogne has considerable claims to antiquity. The name by which it was known to the Romans was Ges soriacum. About the commencement of the Christian era, a fort was built a little to the north of Gessoriacum, on the other side of the Liane, to which the name of Bononia was given, and this name was ultimately identified with the town itself. The Normans sacked Bou logne in 882. Henry III. of England made a fruitless attack upon it in 1347. Henry VIII. made himself master of it in 1544, and Edward VI. restored it to France for 400,000 crowns. After the destruction of Therouane by Charles V. in 1553, the episcopal seat was trans ported to Boulogne, where it existed until 1789. Napoleon elevated the town into celebrity by making it the rendez vous of the \" Grand Armue \"destined for the invasion of England in 1804. The port was unsuccessfully attacked by"], [189, "149 through the promenade Des Petits Arbres, a road conducts to the pretty little cimeltiere. Returning by the same road, passing the Church of St. Joseph, and leaving the Haute Ville by the Porte des Dunes, the Basse Ville, or Lower Town, built on the slope of the hill which descends from the ramparts \u2014 a larger, moie populated, and more commercial district than the upper \u2014 is passed. It is divided into two parts by the River Liane and the harbour. One is known by the name of Capture, and contains the Northern Railway Station and a number of villas and country houses, which are much sought after during the summer season. The other part, which properly constitutes the lower town, contains, in the Grand Rue, the library, composed of more than 40,000 volumes, and open to the public every day but Saturday, from ten till four o'clock. In the same building is the museum, ranking, from the impor tance of its specimens, third in France, open to the public on Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, and to strangers every day from ten till four o'clock. Here will be seen several paintings of merit, and an interesting collection of curiosities. Close to the museum is the Church of St. Nicholas. The theatre, in the Rue Monsigny ; the concert-room, in the Rue Siblequin ; the Sub-Prefectorate, on the Esplanade ; the Post-Office, in the Rue des Vieillards ; the Custom House and the Chamber of Commerce, on the Quai des Paquebots ; British Consulate, Grande Rue ; Electric Telegraph Office, 12, Rue Pot d'Etain ; the Etablissetnent des Bains, the princi pal hotels, and the most important shops, complete the public buildings of Bou logne. There are several English Episcopal Chapels, one in the Haute Ville, the others in the lower town. The bathing establishment is placed on a terrace which looks upon the beach, from whence one may enjoy at the same time a view of the town, the interior of the port, and the agreeable sites of Outreau and Capecure. The English coast in fine weather is clearly marked on the horizon. The establishment is composed of a handsome saloon, measur ing 28 metres in length, by 13 metres in width and 14 metres in height, with card, reading, and billiard rooms, a skating rink, swimming schools, and hot and cold baths, and is open from the 15th of June to the 15th of October. A great number of bathing - machines, lar\u00b0-e enough to hold several persons with ease, are stationed upon the beach, and from five o'clock in the morning until eight o'clock in the evening are in readiness. Those for ladies are attended by bathing- women, and the gentlemen's machines by experienced sailors, all of whom are good swimmers. An active and vigilant look-out against accidents is constantly kept by steady men, whom the Humane and Shipwreck Society maintain at their own expense. The beach of Boulogne is one of the finest on the coast. Alibert, in his \" Elc5mens de Therapeutique,\" remarks on its ad vantages with enthusiasm. \" Nature,\" he sayB, \"seems to have done everything to favour the sea-baths of Boulogne. An immense sandy beach, uniformly firm and even, offers to bathers every possible security. The ground is always the same, whether the tide be high or low : no loose or shifting sands, no stones or pebbles. This plain of sand stretches from north to . south as far as the eye can reach, and is from 2,500 to 3,000 yards wide at low water. When the tide is high, the water flows up to the foot of the terrace of the establishment. The coast is formed by steep, rugged cliffs of immense height, so that that part of the beach devoted to sea-bathing is sheltered from the north and east winds, and also from the south-east, which is by far the driest and most disagreeable of all ; thus the bathers, while in the water, receive only the western breeze, a most rare union of favourable conditions. It is also worthy of remark that, by a most fortunate arrangement, the harbour being formed from east to west, and the beach running in a parallel line to this direction, the bathers constantly receive the influence of the solar rays, which must necessarily add to the salutary effects that we seek to obtain from bathing \" The Ferruginous Mineral Spring, which is known under the name of the \" Iron Fountain,\" is situated in a well, covered by a kiosk, a few hundred yards from the ramparts, on the road from Boulogue to Calais. It yields an abundance of cold and perfectly limpid water, of a slightly rough, astringent,"], [190, "150 and ferruginous taste. Its use is attended with most satisfactory results in complaints of the digestive organs ; it acts most efficaciously in those very cases for which sea-baths themselves are espe cially recommended. One of the princi pal objects of attraction to the visitors of Boulogne is the Column of Napoleon, situated on a hill to the east of the town, about a quarter of a mile distant. Its total height is 164 feet, diameter 13 feet ; a bronze statue of the Emperor, in his coronation robes, by Bosio, 16 feet in height, surmounts the whole, giving a total of 1 76 feet. The base is a square pedestal, with a flight of steps leading up to it ( n each side. It is constructed of marble, from the quarries of Marquise in the neighbourhood. This column was intended to commemorate the invasion of England by Napoleon. The first stone was laid in 1804 by Marshal Soult. According to the inscription on the key stone, it was finished by Louis XVIII., to \"commemorate his happy return to his country,\" in 1814. A magnificent view is afforded from the heights on which Caligula's Tower is situated. This is a favourite promenade of those visitors who enjoy the invigorating sea-breeze which renders Boulogne so healthful a residence. In juxta position is a statue in honour of Napoleon I., erected by Mr. A. K. Kent. Boulogne is surrounded by a charming country, intersected by wide and hand some roads. The population is estimated at 40,000, and the number of passengers passing through the port every year is over a quarter of a million. Principal Hotels: Christol and Bristol; Des Bains; and Imperial. BOVES. \u2014 A small commune in the department of the Somme, and chiefly remarkable for the ruinsof its old castle, which was the residence of the celebrated Gabriel d'Estrdes, mistress of Henry the Fourth of France. Estimated Popu lation: about 1,800. CALAIS. \u2014 This town, seaport, and mail-packet station (in connection with the London Chatham and Dover Channel Service), is in the department of Pas -de-Calais, and arrondissement of Boulogne. The town is supposed to occupy the place of the ancieut Portus Ulterior. It was fortified about 1228, by Philip of France, Count of Boulogne. In 1347 it was taken by capitulation, after a siege of thirteen months, by Edward the Third of England, and held by the English until 1558, when it was regained to France by the Duke of Guise. In 1596 it was captured by the Archduke Albert, but restored by the treaty of Vervins. It is believed to have been the first place a-zainst which cannon were employed. The harbour is defended by severalsmall forts, and is easy of entrance, there being no difficulty of landing iu boats or lying at anchor. It is now undergoing considerable enlargement and extension, and will, when completed, admit vessels of large size. The coast, too, is perfectly safe to approach in thick weather, shoaling gradually towards the shore, so that a vessel may feel her way ; the piers are well constructed; the light- house is remarkably handsome, and the light most brilliant. The pier of Calais is an agreeable promenade, nearly three- quarters of a mile long. It is decorated with a pillar, raised to commemorate the retumof Louis the Eighteenth to France. The Phare de Calais, or lighthouse, was erected in 1845-7, and is fitted up with great attention to ornament as well as use. The ascent up the handsome well staircase of 188 steps is by no means fatiguing, and seats to rest the short breathed climber are placed at regular intervals. To the east stretches the ex panse of sandy dune, which continues its level course to Gravelines and Dun- kerque ; and beyond them, in the back- ground, rises a range of picturesque hills, crowned by the forest of Guines and the quarries of Ferques, to terminate at once in the hunchback of Cape Blanez and the frightful precipice with which it meets the sea ; and if the visitor is acquainted with the locality ho will pick up a mul- titudeofdispersedaudinteresting objects, united to his view, for the first time, in this wide-spread bird's-eye picture. The town (which contains a population of over 13,000) is situated on the coast of the channel to which it gives its name \u2014 the Pas-de-Calais of France, or the Straits of Dover of England. It is of great strength, possessing extensive ramparts, a good citadel, and a fortified gate. It consists of two parts, separated by an esplanade. The faubourg de Courgain extends to the north-east, along the coast, and is chiefly occupied by a seafaring"], [191, "151 population ; the other district, inappro priately designated the upper town, is generally well built, with broad and regularly formed streets. Near the centre is the parade, which is of some extent, and is adorned with handsome edifices. The chief buildings in Calais are the parish church, built during the occupation of the town by the English, in the fourteenth century, the town-hall, the watch-tower, and the inns. At Dessin's hotel may be seen the bed-rooms occupied by Sir Walter Scott aud Sterne. Tho gateway near the railway station is that through wbich access is obtained to the town from the port. Besides the-e, there are a custom-house, bank, college, several schools, a library, hospital, public baths, posting establishment, barracks, (fee. The inhabitants are chiefly engaged in the herring and cod fishery, and carry on aconsiderable traffic iu Dutch spirits. The steamer3 from Dover and London, and the railway communication to Paris, Brussels, and all parts of Belgium, give an animation to this otherwise mono tonous and uninteresting town. Its short distance from Dover, and being the mail station for England, contributes greatly to the prosperity of Calais. Principal Hotels : De Paris ; Dessin ; and Du Commerce. Just is deficient in interesting scenery, and the land wears a barren aspect. The town contains a population of nearly six thousand, chiefly engaged in Cilico bloaching and trading in agricultural produce. Upon the ruins of the ancient castle of the Princes de Conde, a prison has been built. At the foot of this structure is an agreeable promenade, called Li Chatellier. The antiquary should visit the interesting church of Clermont, commenced in the fourteenth century and completed in the sixteenth. The Hiitel de Ville is also curious; it was built in the reign of Philip le Bel, who was born at Clermont. This town is celebrated for the successful cultivation of many varieties of choice fruits, more especially cherries, which are produced in great abundance. Principal Hotel : Des Deux Epees. CREIL. \u2014 A small town in the de partment of Oise. The populace find employment in the manufacture of por celain, besides trading in timber, oil and corn. Creil has much diminished in importance since it had a royal palace on an island in the river Oise, of which there are some remains. Estimated population: 2,500. Principal Hotel: Chemin de Fer (Railway). ETAPLES (and MONTREUIL).\u2014 A small commune in the department of the Pas de Calais. It is situated on the river Canche, near its mouth, and which is here crossed by a viaduct 900 feet in length. The castle, built in 1160, is now a ruin. It was here that the treaty between Henry VII. of Eng land and Charles VIII. of France was signed. There are several breweries and distilleries at Etaples, and it has a small trade in salt. Population: about 2,000. From Etaples a short branch line con nects Montreuil, a town and fortress of the second class, on the banks of tho river Canche, in the department of the Pas de Calais. It has a court of first re sort, an agricultural society and com munal college. The church is a lofty edifice, in the Plantagenet style. The manufacture of soap is carried on ; and there are breweries, tanneries, a paper mill sugar-refinery, (fee. A large export tn ds with England is done iu the table delicacy known as \"pates-de-becasses.\" The town, which contains a population of nearly 4,000, is enclosed by a rampart, CHANTILLY.\u2014 A small commune, in the department of Seine et Oise, about twenty-five miles north of Paris. Chan tilly is frequently called the French \"Newmarket\" from the fact that the French Jockey Club have here their race-course and training-grounds. The racing-stables accommodate large studs of race-horses, and the English colony number nearly a third of the population of the commune. It was at Chantilly that thegreat Conde received Louis NIV. in 1671. The Due d'Aumale is the owner of the restored chateau, which contains some fine paintings, and has a chapel, theatre, stables for 400 horses, und a park The church possesses many tombs of the CohdiS family. The forest adjoining Chantilly affords capital hunt ing, covering as it does a space of nearly 7,000 acres. Population : 3,000. Prin cipal Hotels : Des Baines ; Du Cerf ; Du Cygne. CLERMONT.\u2014 A small town and communo of the department of Oise. The country between Clermont and St. 12"], [192, "152 telegraph offices, the bureaux of the station-masters, and waiting-rooms for the convenience of the passenger traffic. The single roof over the hall gives it a very characteristic appearance. The architecture of this embarcadcre is as unpretending as it is graceful ; a simple cornice crowns the centre of the fa9ade, which is decorated with eight pilasters, rising two by two, and indicating the form and proportions of the nave. The central arch has an elevation of rather more than 100ft., and is surmounted by a statue representing the City of Paris, supported on the right and left by eight other statues personifying the principal cities to which the Northern line serves as a means of intercommunication \u2014 London, Vienna, Berlin, Cologne, Brus sels, St. Petersburg, Amsterdam, and Frankfort \u2014 all executed by sculptors of distinction. Moreover, several allegori cal figures, and a series of statues in honour of many of the towns on tho lino, ornament other portions of the facade. The design of this gigantesque construc tion was due to the architectural skill of M. Hittorff, member of the Institute, and of his talented son, the latter of whom was charged with the superintendence of the execution of the works. N . ts extensive proportions, the terminus has alight and elegant appearance. The centre of the facade commands the boulevard in front of it, from which that portion of it is seen to advantage at a distance ; but the wings can only be contemplated at a few yards' distance on account of the proximity of the houses opposite. The general aspect of Paris never fails to secure the admiration of strangers. Considerably enlarged by the line of fortifications with which it has been surrounded, it extends on both banks of the Seine, over a length of eight miles ; circumference, twenty- two. This space is divided into twodistinct portions: first, that comprised within the old city wall, erected for the collection of the octroi or customs; and secondly, the banlieue, comprised between the old wall and the line of the new fortifications. The first part, which forms the twelve municipal arrondissements of Paris, is, in many parts, covered with splendid monuments, magnificent hotels and gardens. The houses are generally lofty and built iri uniform style. The new streets are wide, and is divided into an upper and lower town, defended by a strong hill fortress. The fortifications are very ancient. The kings of France bad a palace here in the thirteenth century. The town was ceded to the English by the treaty of Brittany. In 1537 Charles the Fifth burned the town, and in 1554 it was again destroyed by the Spaniards. The wife of Philip the First was imprisoned in what is known as Queen Bertha's Tower : her harsh cap tivity ended her life. NOYELLES (and ST. VALERY). \u2014 A small commune in the department of the Somme. Tho place owes such importance as it possesses to being the point of junction for a branch railway to St. Valery \u2014 an ancient and pic turesque town at the mouth of the river Somme, which in some of its features is not unlike the town of Bou logne. St. Valery is rapidly increasing in estimation as a watering-place. It was from here William the Conqueror set sail for the invasion of England, which fact is recorded on a tablet in the centre of the town. Estimated Pojmlation : 4,000. Principal Hotel : De France. PARIS. \u2014 A guide to the great city whose proud boast it is to be \" the heart of the world,\" is not within the scope of this work, which deals pro fessedly and almost exclusively with the places en route to and from London. Some valuable suggestions to travellers and visitors will, however, be found in the Introduction (page xix), and a list of those public buildings, &c, which are only open to public inspection at stated hours is here appended. As connected with the railway, a description of the terminus of the Chemin de Fer du iNord (Northern of France Railway), will be appropriate. The general plan of the station is a quadrilateral of about 180 x 208 yards, thus comprising a super ficies of 34,000 yards. It includes five principal parts \u2014 namely, a grand hall, the salles de depart, followed by what we may call the station proper, where the tickets are distributed ; and on the left the salles d'arrivee, and covered accommodation for the vehicles in waiting. In the interior are nine lines of rail, separated by four large and six smaller platforms. The building com posing the fa9ade comprises the Salon, with its accessory chambers, the post and"], [193, "153 straight, well paved, and lighted with gas and by electricity, but many of the old streets are narrow and crooked. The Seine, as observed, traverses Paris from east to west, and within the limits of the city it is crossed by twenty-three bridges and receives the small stream of Bievre or the Gobelins, and the canal of St. Martin, which joins those of the Ourcq and St. Denis. It here forms two islands, the Re St. Louis and the Re de la Cite', on which last the cathedral of Notre is situated, the Hotel Dieu, the Palace of Justice, &c. The portion of the capi tal seated ou the rl-ght bank of the river is the most extensive, and contains the greatest number of public offices ; the centre is occupied by tbe Bourse or Ex change. In this quarter are the Louvre, ruins of the Tuileries, the Elys.e Napo leon, Hotel de Ville (rebuilding), the National Opera House, Madeleine, -fee. Its principal streets and squares are the place de la Concords, place de l'Opcra, rue de l'Opcra, place Vendome, rue de Rivoli, rue de la Paix, rue Castiglione. Most of these are in the centre or west of Paris. The chief objects in the east are the Halle au Ble, Fontaine des Innocens, and the column of July. The finest and most fashionable promenades are the boulevards and the Champs Elysees, at the west end of which is the triumphal arch of l'Etoile and the Bois de Boulogne, at the other end the place du Carrousel andgardenof theTuileries ; and in the east, the cemetery of Pere la Chaise. The left bank of the river con tains tho Fauborg St. Germain, the principal residence of the old noblesse. On this side is the Pays Latin, the seat of the principal educational establish ments, as the Sorbonne, College of France, and Colleges of St. Louis, Louis le-Grand, Henry the Fourth, Polytechnic School, Normal School, School of Medi cine, and Schools of Law. The principal public buildings on this side are the Luxembourg Palace, Palace of the Fine Arts, the Odeon, Palace of the Legislation, Palace of the Institute, the Mint, the Pantheon, Hotel des Invalides, Military School, Jardin des plantes, and the Gobelins. This quarter also contains the greatest number of hospitals, the largest of which is the Salpetriere. Here aro also the ruins of the Palace des Thormcs, Hotel Cluny, the abattoirs of Grenelle and Villejuif, and the Artesian well. The space contained between the city walls and the fortified circle is composed of the communes of the banlieue, compris ing, on the right bank, Bercy, Charonue, Belleville, La Villette, La Chapelle, Montmartre, Les Batignolles, Passy, and Auteuil; and on the left bank, Grenelle, Vaugirard, Montrouge, and Gentilly. The approach to the new walls is defended by thirteen detached forts, viz., Romainville, Noisy, Rosny, Nogent, Charenton, and the Castle of Vincennes, on the east ; Bicetre, Montrouge, Van vres, Issy, on the south; on the west, Mont Valerien ; and on the north, Aubervilliers and St. Denis, with the Couronno de la Briche and double Couronne.

PICQUIGNY.\u2014 A small commune of the department of La Somme, and situated on the left bank of the river Somme. At this place a treaty was signed between Edward IV. and Louis XL, who met for the purpose on the bridge which crosses the river (1475). William of Normandy, surnamed Longswood, was assassinated at this place. Estimated population : 2,000. RUE. \u2014 A small town and commune in the department of the Somme. It is"], [194, "154 remarkable for the number of its chapels, at which many miracles are said to have been performed. The river Mayo flows through tho commune, and discharges itself into the sea a short distance from the town. The battle-field of Crecy \u2014 one of the most memorable engagements recorded in French and English history (1460)\u2014 is reached from this place, although tourists, as a rule, more generally patronise the diligence route from Abbeville. Estimated population : 2,000. ST. DENIS.\u2014 A small town of the department of the Seine, four miles north, of Paris, lt is situated in a fertile plain en the Crou, near the right bank of the Seine, and of the canal of the same name, which connects the canal of Ourcq with the Seine. It is well built, and has handsome barracks, an asylum for the houseless poor, a small theatre, a public library ; it has also several bleacheries, cotton-spinning mills, tanneries, corn- mills, (tc. ; and an active trade iu flour, wine, vinegar, wood, and wool. Fairs are held four times a year. The origin of one of these \u2014 distinguished by the name of Londit \u2014 is dated as far back as the seventh century. It is one of the most important sheep fairs in Franco, the average sale of sheep exceeding annually 100,000. St. Denis was originally a small village, named Cato lacum. A chapel, which was erected here in the third century over the tomb of St. Denis the Martyr, became the nucleus of the subsequent church. Tho present magnificent cathedral and royal mausoleum is one of the crowning glories of France, and has rendered the name of St. Denis renowned rthroughout the world. The cathedral was originally founded in the twelfth or thirteenth century by King Dagobert, in connec tion with tbe celebrated Benedictine Abbey of St. Denis, and formed the ordinary place of sepulture of the royal family of Franco and of othor illustrious personages. By decree of the Con- vention in 1793 the royal tombs were destroyed, aud the valuable relics and other treasures of the Abbey, including the crown aud sword of Charlemagne, the sword ot Joan of Arc, the great cross, (tc, carried away. Tho buildings of the Abbey are now used as an estab- lishment for the oducation of daughters of the members of the Legion of Honour. The exterior of St. Denis is much sur- passed by that of Notre Dame, Rheims, and Amiens. Restorations have been goiug on here for many centuries, at different epochs and under several dynasties. The crypt, which contains the tombs of the kings of France, is quite a museum of sculpture. The interior perhaps exceeds that of Notro Dame. The style of the architecture is a kind of Lombard-Gothic. Folibieu, in his \" Lives of Celebrated Architects,'' says that Abbot Suger ought to be considered as one of the most intelli- gent men who lived in the twelfth century. He repaired and enlarged St. Denis, took upon himself the principal share of the work ; began it towards the year 1140, and finished it in less than ten years with an extraordinary magnificence, as may be learned from his own description. Some of the sido- chapels, the shrines of the ancient kings of France, are very splendid, from tho rich colours that cover the walls, from the sparkling dyes of the windows, tho golden ribs anel bosses of the groining which is starred on a blue ground, lt is unquestionably one of \" sights'' of France. At St. Denis are the principal locomotive works of the Northern of France Railway, which covers an im- mense extent of ground Estimated population: 10,000."], [195, "155 PRINCIPAL PLACES ON THE THROUGH ROUTES TO BRUSSELS (via CALAIS AND via OSTEND). ALOST.\u2014 A Belgian town of the province of East Flanders, near the cou nnes of S. Brabant, 15 m. W.N.W. Brus sels, and 3 m. S. the Audegem station of the Ostende and Brussels Railway. It is surrounded with walls, which have five gates, and is traversed by the Dender, which has been converted into a canal, from Alost to its junction with the Scheldt at Termonde or Dendcrmonde, 8 in. below. The finest building in the town is the church of St. Martin, said to be by the architect of the cathedral of Amiens. It is either unfinished, or has been partially destroyed ; but the part existing forms one of the largest and finest churches in Belgium, and is adorned by a celebrated picture by Rubens \u2014 St.Roch beseeching our Saviour to stay the plague of Alost. Within tho church is the mausoleum of Thierry Martens, a native of the town, who in troduced the art of printing into Belgium, a.d. 1475. The inscription states, with some ambiguity, and without much re gard to accuracy, that he was the first printer of Germany, France, and the Netherlands. The only other buildings worthy cf notice are the townhouse, vvhich was founded a.d. 1200, and has been recently rebuilt ; and the college, vnich is a handsome structure. Tho cues public institutions besides the col lege, are the hospital, the academy of design, the chamber of commerce, and the horticultural society. Both tho trade and manufactures of Alost are of con siderable importance. The former is in com, oil, and particularly hops, which are extensively grown in the neighbour hood. The latter are chielly lace, cotton goods, hats, leather, glue, chicory, tobacco, and the various products of numerous breweries, distilleries, salt refineries, flax and cotton mills, bleachfields, printfields, dyeworks, copper and iron foundries. Alost, of which tho earliest mention in charters is a,d. 870, was anciently the capital of what was called imperial Flanders. Tho French, under Turenne, took it in 1667, but were obliged to abandon it after their signal defeat by Marlborough, at Eamilies, in 1706. Several Roman coins have been found in the neighbourhood. Estimated popu lation: 20,000. Principal hotel: De Flandre. BRUGES. \u2014 A Belgian city, and the capital of the province of West Flanders. It is surrouuded with a double water line, which include the canals of Ostend (which traverses the city, and is of great depth), Ghent and the tho Damme or Sluice (Ecluse), all of which here conjoin. The city has 54 bridges\u2014 42 stone and 12 wooden \u2014 all opening in the middle for the passage of vessels ; is of an oval shape, lying S.W. to N.E., and is fully 4 m. in circuit. It is surrounded by walls with seven gates, and has more than 200 streets. Many of these, owing to tho great decrease of the population in modern times, seem half deserted ; but they have all a veuerable look, and bear upon them a strong impress of the Middle Ages. The houses in the leading, and even in some of tho retired streets, mostly remain as they were originally erected and iu excellent preservation, with lofty fantastic gables and ornate fronts, abounding in quaint designs. Bruges is the seat of a bishop, the seat of assize courts fortheproviuce, and was long one of the finest cities of Europe. Near the Grand Place, or chief square, stands the old edifice called Halles (cloth and other halls, or markets), a square building, surmounted by a tower 354 ft. high, in which is a very numerous and sweetly-toned set of chimes. The precise date of this edifice is unknown. Burnt in 1280, and again in 1-493, it was exten sively repaired, if not quite rebuilt, in 1502. A watch has been kept in it for more than three centuries, to give the alarm the moment a fire appears in the"], [196, "156 city or environs. To the E. of the market-place stands the Hotel de Ville, and a small but beautiful Gothic town house, containing several quaint pic tures. Adjoining it is the town library, of about 8,000 vols., and 500 to 000 MSS., most of which belonged to the old abbey of Dunes. Abutting on the town house is tbe chapel of St. Basil, composed of two distinct chapels \u2014 an upper and a lower ; the front being a kind of screen of florid Gothic. Contiguous to this double chapel is the Government-house and the court-house. The old parts of tho latter contain rooms once inhabited by the sove reign Counts of Flanders, and Dukes of Burgundy. Bruges Cathedral is of un gainly exterior but imposing interior, rich in pictures, monuments and brasses, and choir stalls embossed with the escutcheons of the early kn ights of the Golden Fleece, an order which,founded inBruges in 1429, by Philip of Burguudy, dates from the thirteenth century. The adjacent Church of Notre Dame, dating from the same periol, contains tho sumptuous marble tombs of Charles the Bold and Mary of Burgundy, many pictures, and the exquisitely wrought statue of tho Virgin and Child, attributed to Michael Angelo. Facing the west side of the church is the Hospital of St. John. Then there is the Eglise de Jerusalem, with its imitations ot the Holy Sepulchre, to which a devout burgomaster made two pilgrimages to ensure the resemblance ; thero is the Chapelle du Saint Sang, where the \"Holy Blood,\" said to have been brought from the Holy Land by Count Theodoric of Flanders, is shown each Friday morning ; there i3 the Palais de Justice, with its remarkable Renaissance fiie- place, executed in honour of Charles V. ; and in the Grande Place there 13 the striking Hotel de Ville, begun in 1377 ; the medi\u00e6val house called au Lion de Flandre, in which Charles II. of England, who was made \" King of the Guild of Archers,\" is said to have passed part of his exile ; and there too in the market place stands the well-known Belfry. Estimated population : 50,000. Prvncipal Hotels : De Commerce ; De Flandre. BRUSSELS.\u2014 The capital of the Belgian Kingdom aud province of South Brabant is on the banks of the River branches, one of wliich passes by the old market-place, and the other crosses the garden of tho Chartreux. It form four islands in the interior of the town, the two principal of which are called Saint-Gery and Bon-Secours, and is frequently styled \" Paris in miniature.\" The greatest length of Brussels from north-north-east to south-south-west is about one mile and a half, and its greatest breadth about a mile and a quarter. The town is partly built on tho side of a hill, and is enclosed by a wall, which has eight gates ; the shape of the city is not unlike a flat iron. In side the wall is a wide boulevard planted with fine trees, which is divided into an upper and a lower town. Tho upper town is on the eastern side ; it is also the newest and most fashionable quarter. Here are the King's palace, the legisla tive chambers, aud public offices, se parated from the palace by the park, in the north-eastern angle of which is a theatre. In the upper town also are all the principal hotels and the residences of foreign ambassadors and ministers. The features of the lower town are its well-built streets, which contain many fine old buildings. It has splendid churches and several handsome squares surrounded by noble mansions, some of them unrivalled specimens of Gothic civil architecture. An entirely new quarter, called the Quartier Leopold, has recently sprung up to tho east of the town. French is the prevailing lan guage of Brussels, but English is vory generally spoken ; Flemish is also spoken by many of the lower orders. Brussels, besides being one of the best built cities in Europe, is considered a very pleasant and healthy place of residence. The Cathedral (Church of St. Gudule), the choir and transepts of which are of the 13th century, the nave and towers of the 14th, and other portions of the 15th, 16th, and 17th, is rich in old stainea glass and monuments. The carved wooden pulpit by Verbruggen (1699) re presents the expulsion of Adam and Eve from Paradise. The museum is open daily from 10 to 3 (free), and contains 375 pictures of first-class masters. The Palace of Industry is a permanent ex hibition of inventions and manufactures The Burgundian Library, open dady from 10 to 3 (free), contains more than Serme, which enters the city by two"], [197, "157 20,000 MSS. of great interest and value. The Palais de Justice contains two re markable historical paintings by Gaillait and E. de Biefve. In the Porte de Hal (a remnant of the old fortifications), there is an interesting coUection of arms and armour. The Hotel de Ville, with its elegant tower, 364 feet high, was built 1442-1450. In the rear of this building is the curious \" mannikin \" statue and fountain. Among the other objects of interest are the King's Palace, the Ducal Palace, the Palais de la Nation, the vestibule of which is adorned with modern statues, the church of Notre- Dame de la Chapelle, with its mu ral paintings by Van Eycken, the tomb of Peter Breughel, etc. ; tho Martyrs' Monument to the memory of the Bel gians who fell in September, 1830, iu the war with the Dutch ; the boulevards, the Botanical and Zoological Gardens ; the Wierz Museum, a collection of curious paintings by the artist Wierz, open daily from 10 to 3 (free) ; the Central, with its fountains, the Wood of Glambrois, Forest of Soignies, etc., etc. Visitors to the battle-field of Waterloo should take the railway from the southern Station to Braine l'Alieud (8 miles). Estimated Population: within the walls 175,000 ; with the suburbs, about 380,000. Principal Hotels : Grand Hotel de Brussels ; Grand Hotel Bri tannique ; De 1' Europe ; De France ; and Du Grand Miroir. Bruges Canal. The town is, on the whole, well built. In some of the older parts, where many of the houses have gable fronts which rise tier above tier, and present a very fantastic appearance, the streets are often dark, and so narrow that two carriages can scarcely pass ; but in the other quarters the streets are in general straight and spacious, with rows of handsome houses, fronting canals enclosed by magnificent quays. There are a great number of squares, among which the most deserving of notice are the March6 du Vendredi, where the weekly market is held, and where, in early times, the Counts of Flanders were inaugurated, and the trades unions used to rendezvous ; the Canter, or parade, planted with lime-trees, and surrounded by elegant edifices ; the Plain de St. Pierre, a large space, used especially for reviews and military exercises ; the Corn Market, near the centre of the town ; the Place de St. Phara'ilde, where the gate of the castle of the Counts of Flanders still stands ; and the Plaine des Recollets, remarkable for the number of its fine mansions and hotels. Before leaving the squares it may be proper to mention, that near the Marche du Vendredi there is an enormous cannon, 18 feet long, 10 feet in circuit, and nearly 3 feet wide at its mouth, evidently a prototype or twin sister of the famous Mons Meg, now in Edinburgh Castle, formed, like her, of circles and bars of iron, and surnamed Dulle Griete, equivalent in Flemish to Mad Margaret. The cathedral church of St. Bavon, the crypt of which was conse crated in 941, is the glory of Ghent ; the whole of the interior is lined with black marble, relieved at intervals with grace ful scrolls and white monuments of Parian purity and delicacy. There are twenty-four chapels within the walls J the altars are alternately composed of gold, silver, and marble ; the rarest paintings and the most elaborate sculp ture teem upon all sides. One of the chapels contains a picture of European fame, \" The Adoration of the Lamb,\" by the brothers Van Eyck. The wing3 are wanting ; two are in the Brussels Gallery, and others in the Gallery of Berlin. The church of St. Michael's contains a once -celebrated \"Crucifixion,\" by Vandyck, spoilt by the restorers. St. Nicholas and the other churches are CALAIS. (See Paris route-page 150.) GHENT (or Gand).\u2014 A Belgian city, the capital of the province of East Flan ders, situated on a fertile plain at the con fluence of th e Lys with the Scheldt. The Ternenzen Canal communicates with the sea, and admits vessels drawing fifteen feet of water. It occupies a triangular space above eight miles in circuit, is sur rounded by walls, defended by a strong citadel, and entered by seven gates. In the interior the most striking feature is the great number of canals, which branch off from the Lys in all directions, and forming a kind of network within the town, divide it into twenty-six islands, communicating with each other by forty-two large and forty-six small bridges. Another striking feature is the number of fine promenades, of which the most remarkable is the Coupure, formed by rows of trees along tho"], [198, "158 all interesting for their art treasures. Near the Cathedral is the Belfrv, 386 feet in height, and sui mounted by a huge gilt dragon brought from St. Sophia, at Constantinople, in 1204, by Count Bald win IX. The mechanism of the chimes can be examined in the tower, tho view from which embraces half Flanders. Pcrjndation : about 130,000. Principal Hotels: De la Poste; Royal; aud Do Vienne. of the Dukes of Burgundy. It was built by Jean-sans-Peur, 1430, and inhabited by the Emperor Charles V. It is a quaint rather than a handsome edifice, in the late Gothic style ; but it has a prettily groined staircase in one of its tourelles, and a chapel built by Phillipe le Bel and painted by Arnoldde Vuez. One division of the building, appropriated to a school of art, contains a most interesting and valuable collection of drawings by old masters, formed by the late M. Wicar, including 86 by Raphael (sketches for the School of Athens, various Madonnas, La Perla, (fee), 197 by Michael Angelo (chiefly architectui al \u2014 tho cupola of St. Peter's, Prometheus, Last Judgment), 10 by Fra Barlolomeo, 15 by Francia, 5 by L. da Vinci, etc., etc., well worthy tho inspect ion of all who take an interest in art. This interesting building now comprises tho chief municipal offices ; the public library aud museums, several churches with fine paintings, the Protestant church, synagogue, and prefecture: fine large hospitals, several extensive barracks, the prisons, exchange, mint, theatre, concert-hall, and large corn storehouses ; and among its public esta blishments are, a valuable picture gallery, Academies of music and architecture, and a botanic garden. The canal on which Lille is built has several branches navi gable by small vessels, and along ono part of it, called the Middle Deule, is a lino esplanade, close to which is the handsome Pont Royal. The city de rives great importanco from being ono of the chief seats of the French thread and cotton manufactures. Calicoes, cotton handkerchiefs, printed goods, table linen, fine linen, cloths, thread, lace, stockings, and gloves, are its principal articles of commerce ; in cotton-spinning it also rivals some of the towns in Lancashire. It has also considerable manufactories of broad cloths, kerseymeres, serges, and other worsted stuffs ; velvets, hats, paper, beet root sugar, and mineral acids, with government tobacco and gunpowder manufactories, and an extensive fabrica tion of gold coin. The vicinity of the city is studded with bleaching-grounds, rape seed oil-mills, and beet-root plantations, the two latter of which are very impor tant, employing many hundreds of the inhabitants. A railway connects Lille HAL. \u2014 A small Belgian town of tho province of Brabant, 30 miles S.S.W. from Brussels. It contains a beautiful Gothic church, dedicated to Sainte-Marie, and celebrated for its so-called miraculous image of the Virgin. The grand altar in this church, constructed of white marble, surmounted by a gorgeous taber nacle, and ornamented with beautiful sculptured bas-reliefs, the whole crowned by a figure of the pelican \u2014 a medi\u00e6val symbol of Christ \u2014 is said to be uneqalled even in Belgium. In the baptistry the font of gorgeous brass is placed under a spire, adorned with statues and groups in high relief. The church was formerly dedicated to St. Martin. A statue was erected here in 1871 to the memory of Servais, the violoncellist, on the principal place of the town. Population: about 8,000. Principal Hotels : Des Pays Bas, Luc de Brabant. HAZEBROUCK\u2014 A small town, commune, and military station of the Departement du Nord, in France. It is situated on the river Beurre, and has an ancient church with a lofty spire, a com munal college, and public library ; also manufactories of linen, yarn and cloth. Hazebrouck is the point of junction with the Dunkirk railway. Estimated population: 5,000. LILLE. \u2014 A strongly fortified and manufacturing city, the capital of the Departement du Nord, on the Deule, a canal connecting the Scarpe and Lya rivers, 26 miles N.N.E. of Arras, in France. It is entered by seven gates, and has a strong citadel, with barracks and magazines on its N.W. side ; it is pretty w ell laid out, having many straight and wide streets lined with substantial brick houses, a Grande Place of noble extent, and about twenty other squares ; but the quarters inhabited by the manu facturing population are narrow. The Hotel de Ville was anciently the palace"], [199, "159 with Brussels and Ghent, through Cour trai, Roubaix, and Turcoing, all indus trial towns of importance. Lille, which successively belonged to the counts of Flanders, kings of France, and earls of Burgundy, was finally annexed to the crown of France by Louis XIV. in 1667. It was taken, after a three months' siege, by the allies under the Duke of Marl borough and Prince Eugene in 1708, and was bombarded by the Austrians in 1792. The Porte de Paris entrance to the city is by a sort of triumphal arch, sur mounted by a frontispiece in the fashion of a screen propped up behind, filled with the trophies of the glory of Louis XIV. ; erected 1082. It is impossible to enter Lille without being struck by the impos ing character of its fortifications. To penetrate into the city, it is necessary to traverse its formidable lines of defence, ramparts, bridges, and moats. This was a chef-d'oeuvre cf the famous engineer Vauban. In the centre of the Grande Palace stands a column erected in 1841, and commemorative of the citizens who died while defending their native city against the Austrians in 1702. The Musee is one of the finest in France, and contains a rich collection of paintings by the Flemish, Italian, and Spanish masters. The terminus at Lille is in the Faubourg de Fives. Estimated pojvdation : nearly 70,000. Principal Hotels : Du Commerce; De l'Europe ; and De France. OSTEND. \u2014 A Belgian seaport town, and mail packet station on the North Sea. It is strongly and regularly fortified ; being one of the line of fortresses in- tended to defend the Belgian frontier on the side of France. Its situation, on a low sandy coast, where no trees will grow, i3 by no means agreeable ; though it is said to have a pure, healthy air, and is much resorted to for sea bathing. It is entered by four gates, and is, on the whole, well built. The public buildings, none of which deserve particular notice are theHotel de Ville, three churches (one Protestant), a prison, a oivil and a mili- tary hospital, barracks and an arsenal. There are several promenades ; but the most agreeable, from lying open to the breeze, is the Digue, a sea wall, about half a mile long, and paved with bricks. The harbour is not easy of access, but the basin within is extensive, and forms the termination of a magnificent line of canals, stretching like net-work into th-? interior, and furnishing admirable facili ties for commerce. The sluices of Sy kens, opening from the canal into tho harbour, are particularly admirable, and the canal itself, as far as Ghent, has a depth sufficient to float vessels of 600 tons. The manufactures of Ostend ar\u00ab unimportant, but include linen goods and sail-cloth, lace, oil, soap, hats,tobacco, (tc. There are also building decks and several other industrial establishments. Cod and herring fishing are carried on to a considerable extent, aud an important branch of trade is oysters, brought from the English coast, fattened here in large salt reservoirs, and transported as far as Paris, under the name of huitres d'Os tende. Ostend possesses a school of navigation, an academy of design and architecture, several primary schools, a theatre, a public garden beyond the walls, a mont- de-piete, and several other bene volent institutions. It was founded in the 9th century, walled in 1445, and regularly fortified in 1585, by the Prince of Orange. In the great struggle in which the States-General threw off the yoke of Spain, it sustained a memorable siege from 1601 to 1604, during which the besieged lost about 50,000, and the Spanish besiegers more than 80,000 men. Ultimately, when reduced to a mere heap of ruins, it obtained an honourable capitulation. In 1826, a great part of the town was destroyed by tne explosion of a powder magazine. Ostend is con nected with England by submarine electric telegraph. Estimated population : 18,000. Principal Hotels: Du Grand Cafe; Grand Marion; Great Ocean; Mer tiau ; Du Littoral ; and Roval do Prusse. ST. OMER.\u2014 A large town and third-rate fortress of the Departement of Pas de Calais, in France. It is a picturesque town situated on the river Aa, at the mouth of the caual of Neuf- Fossee. It is surrounded by irregular fortifications, and is defended by Fort Notre Dame. The town has a tribunal de commerce, a communal college, a public library of 20,000 volumes, a cathedral of the fourteenth century, with the tomb of its founder, St. Omer, and manufactories of coarse woollens, pipes, and paper. St. Omer was taken by Louis the Fourteenth in 1677. During the first revolution it was called"], [200, "160 Morin la Montagne. St. Omer is a fortress, whose means of defence lie less in its actual fortifications than in tho marshes which surround it, and the facility afforded by the river Aa, on which it stands, of flooding the land rouud about, so as to leave only a quarter of its circuit unprotected by the waters. There are, however, two ecclesiastical edifices worthy of notice, and we extract the following particulars fromAfurrai/'s valuable handbook: \u2014 \"The Cathedral, at the upper end of the Rue St. Bertin, is a fine building, showing the transition from the round to the pointed style. The east end is a good example of the polygonal termination of churches with projecting chapels so common on the Continent. The interior is good ; the small lady chapel has modern decorations. At the opposite extremity of the same street stand the scanty remains of the famous Abbey Church of St. Bertin, at one time tbe noblest Gothic monument of French Flanders \u2014 in its present state a disgrace to the town and a reproach to the Government ; for be it known that its destruction has been perpetrated since 183 1. At the outbreak of the great Revolution the monastery was sup pressed ; the Convention spared it ; and though under the Directory it was sold for the materials, unroofed, aud stripped of its woodwork and metal, yTet its walls remained comparatively uninjured until the magistrates barbarou4y pulled it down to afford employment to some labourers out of work. The fragment remaining consists of a stately tower built in the 15th century (1431\u20141461), displaying the ornaments of the florid Gothic in the mutilated panelling on its walls and bits of tracery in its window ; a small portion of the nave remains attached t s it. The tower, threatening to fall, has been propped by an ugly, ill-contrived buttress of masonry ; there is some talk of converting it into a museum. The town i3 well seen from its top, but there is nothing else of interest in the view. Within the walls of the Abbey of St. Bertin the feeble Childeric III., the last king of the first race, ended his days ; here also Becket sought refuge when a fugitive from England. A seminary for the education of English and Irish Catholics exists here ; it has succeeded the celobrated Jesuits' College founded by Father Parsons for the education of young Englishmen. Daniel O'Connell was brought up here for the priesthood, and several of the conspirators engaged in the Gunpowder Plot were pupils of the same school. There are not more than fifteen or twenty students at present. About 400 English reside here.\" Popu lation : about 20,000. Principal Hotels : Du Commerce ; and De la Porte d'Or et d'Angleterre. TOURNAY\u2014 A Belgian city within the Provinoe of Hainault. The Cathedral is the principal public building, and is both ancient and intere.-ting. It con tains numerous internal ornaments and a painting by Rubens. There are four uglier churches, having many features of attraction. Tournay was captured by Henry VIII. of England, and bestowed upon Cardinal Wolsey, who subsequently persuaded his master to dispose of it to Francis I. The public library is a valuable one, and there is a museum in the Hotel de Ville, Population : about 35,000. Principal Hotels : De l'lmp^ra trico ; Du Singe d'Or."], [201, "ADVERTISEMENTS.
