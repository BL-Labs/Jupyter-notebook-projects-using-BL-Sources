CHAPTER I. \" They have no vision of a better world, To whom this present world seems not a dream.\" It was somewhat against the etiquette of Septuagesima Convent that the ladies in- habiting it as boarders should extend their excursions beyond its walls, but this rule admitted of relaxation, and in consideration, perhaps, of her difference of religion and re- cent affliction, it had never been enforced on Mademoiselle de MeTiul. She had rarely, indeed, profited by this indulgence, but one spring-like afternoon, shortly after Godensca's visit, tempted her forth to explore the old city. Her footsteps paused suddenly and involuntarily, in passing the church of Notre Dame, at the sound of a summons from its bells. She listened for a moment in sur prise, believing that the usual hour for even ing service was later at that season ; but the sight of groups entering the building seemed VOL. III. B"], [8, "2 VERONIA. to announce some extra ceremony, and though utterly careless as to what it might be, an impulse of curiosity prompted her to ask the question. \"There is to be a great sermon,\" said an old woman in French, after glancing at the questioner, \" such a one as we don't hear every day \u2014 are you coming in ? \" \" Thank you, no,\" answered Veronia. \" I am a stranger, and it was mere idleness that made me ask.\" \" That's a pity, but perhaps you don't know who is the preacher ? It is the very Reverend Father H , who was miracu lously converted from being a Jew, and persecutor of the Church, to become a holy Christian \u2014 like Saint Paul, you know, ex actly the same,\" said the keen old dame, suddenly divining that Veronia was a Pro testant, and having a dim notion of having heard that St. Paul was a favourite and high authority with persons of that persuasion. She had struck, though at random, upon a right chord, for, little as her studies had lain in that direction, still memory carried Veronia back to the day when in her father's Bible she had read the tak and sympa thised, with the enthusiasm of youth, in the"], [9, "VERONIA. 3 Apostle's chivalrous and noble history. And with this memory came a thought of the great contrast this bold and hardy nature offered to the slavish defenders of Popery, as she conceived it, and wonder what a fanatic, grovelling monk could have to say on such a theme, or how he could have merited the old dame's ready comparison. The latter had watched the reflection of these thoughts upon Veronia's face, and seemed bent on drawing her into the church. \"Will you come, my daughter?\" said she, opening the door for her ; \" you won't repent it \u2014 it's his last sermon.\" And so Mademoiselle de Mehul went in to hear the man who had been a Jew, \u2014 nay, an atheist, a profligate, and, though she knew it not, a brilliant constellation in the firmament of art. She was startled at perceiving the im mense assemblage which filled the build ing \u2014 from the poorest artisan to the well dressed lounger of the upper classes \u2014 all hushed, as it seemed, in expectation of some uncommon event. With great difficulty her conductress forced a way for her up the grand aisle to the very front of the pulpit, pointed out a E 2"], [10, "4 VERONIA. vacant seat, and then, -with a grave nod, retired herself to another part of the building. Curiously did Veronia's eye wander over the many faces around her, and remark on almost all of them the same expression of expectant interest and gravity, .which the most profound silence equally attested. A sudden turning of all eyes in one direction announced the entrance of the bishop and his attendant clergy, and an instant afterwards the same universal glance towards the pulpit drew Veronia's with it. The figure on which her look now rested was that of a man, still young, apparently, and clothed in the habit of the Dominican order. His pale, strongly marked physiog nomy, and dark, earnest eyes, at once denoted his Jewish origin. Wan and meagre as were his features they wore a singular and impressive beauty, the emanation of some influence within. It was a face such as the world never presents to us ; suggestive of a life such as it is not given to its votaries to understand. The preacher knelt down : he turned towards the crucifix before him, and folded his hands simply like a child to whom prayer is a natural and habitual action,"], [11, "5 VERONIA. and when he rose again, and every hand had made, like his, the sacred sign, the hush of the vast assembly was such that even the breathing of each one there might have fallen distinctly on his neighbour's ear. There was another moment of silence, and then the tones of a rich, full, harmoni ous voice pealed forth, with a strength and clearness which sent a thrill of surprise through the auditory, as coming from that fragile form, \" And believing, shall rejoice with joy unspeakable and glorious.\"* The face of the speaker had changed as he uttered these words : the wonderful calmness of his countenance had kindled into warmth and brightness, and, as his eye roved over the many faces beneath him, with the look of one who would fain read there the history and secrets of each breast, it was evident that the depths of his own heart were deeply stirred. \" I have traversed the world, I have known the world, I have loved the world ; it is then of that which I have seen, known, and loved, that I am going to speak to you, it is the history of my own soul that I offer * 1st Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle, 1st chapter and 8th verse."], [12, "6 VERONIA. for your perusal, the experience of my own life that I would fain contribute to yours.\" He paused, raised his hands slightly, and making a step backwards, continued in a lower tone : \u2014 \" Look at me, my brethren, consider at your ease the man who comes among you with the words of the apostle on his lips, and dares to echo them. Look at him, I say again, and let me tell you what in the world's language is the judgment you will pass upon him. He is a monk, you will say \u2014 poor, miserable, and hopeless \u2014 the obscure member of an austere order, the rules of which impose on him an existence of labour, privation, and abstinence from all that renders life endurable to other men ; he looks sad, and woebegone, for though young, he has renounced the pleasures of youth, and wedded himself to penury and a cell. Solitude and silence are his most frequent companions ; fasting, discipline, and thoughts of death his usual entertain ments. And this man expects us to believe him when he tells us of ' rejoicing with joy unspeakable ! ' \" Softly, my brethren,\" and his tone sank again ; \" have patience with the poor monk,"], [13, "7 VERONIA. accuse him not hastily of exaggeration, con demn him not unheard. You have come here to listen to him to-night, and he asks you to suspend judgment until you have heard all. \" Not more surprising than to some of you may be his proclamation of happiness, would it have been some few years back to himself to think how, and in what habit, he should stand before you on this night.? \"A monk, a humble son St. Dominic! Ah ! when he first entered life, with what disdain would he have listened to the sug gestion of ever becoming that ! Health, wealth, prosperity of every kind had filled for him to the brim the cup of life, and to these was added the resolve to draw from each and all the fullest measure of enjoy ment they could yield. He would have pleasure ; pleasure such as the warm dream of youth paints asJ the acme of all felicity, the realization of all desire ; and what so easy, for he had gold, and we know what it can purchase for lavish hands. He would have homage, and \u2014 as of one long dead to this world, it may be said, without pre sumption \u2014 that Nature had bestowed on him the gifts which draw it even from un-"], [14, "8 VERONIA. willing lips. He would have power over other hearts, and the strong magic of will brought within his grasp a larger portion than falls in general to the young ; finally, he would have happiness \u2014 that draught of full, abundant, overflowing joy, for which the heart of man so instinctively thirsts, and for which all human language furnishes no adequate expression \u2014 and how think you it fared with him then ? \" Ask your own hearts, brethren, they can answer for him ! Pleasure he had revelled in to satiety ; of homage he had won enough to fill the proudest heart that ever beat like his with longing for an artist's glory \u2014 for that had been the object of all his ambition \u2014 and he spurned them both at last like worn-out toys ; but he was young, and happiness he had not yet found. \" He thought then that he had sought it in too crowded a path, that it fled perhaps from scenes of pleasure, from the noise of the great world, and the triumphs of am bition, and resided, perchance, as said by philosophy, in the calmer regions of a purely intellectual life, or the cultivation of the affections alone. \" He tried both. Ardently he threw him-"], [15, "VERONIA. 9 self into the world of thought, and strove to exclude recollections of a past, which had not been wholly exempt from remorse. Heaven had given him talents \u2014 nay, genius, it was said \u2014 its exercise should form his world ; and so it did, but happiness came not within. \" Then,\" and the preacher's voice softened still more, \"he thought of Adam in his Paradise, and said to himself that there still remained one thing untried ; happiness lay perhaps wholly in the possession of one de voted heart. So with the passion of an un tamed nature, he offered up his being upon the altar of a mortal love. And there awaited him, as it awaits so many, the last, most cruel deception mortality can know. A pang like that the gamester feels, when, having staked all, he sees all swept away, yet, in the desolation of that moment, the idolater of pleasure, fame, and vanity awoke to the true nature of the soul which he had pledged so idly, and, in the joy of that awakening, he gave himself to God ! \" I have selected this life, my brethren, to lay before you, as \u2014 being in many respects an exceptional one \u2014 it better illustrates my theme."], [16, "10 VERONIA. \" Sorrow, sickness, and strife, such as are the usual heritage of man, had never touched it. From its commencement until its worldly close all had been smiling, all smooth. If any man could have been happy, it should have been surely one placed under such conditions, and yet this one failed, like the most miserable of his kind. He failed until one day \u2014 that day on which he renounced the hope of happiness on earth \u2014a greater gift, the gift of peace, was granted to him. \"Ah! peace may sound to you but a cold word in exchange for the glowing one of happiness, but the peace of which I speak means something better still ! It means that gladness which the apostle spoke of as joy unspeakable, and that, even under circum stances which to the eye of humanity seem incompatible with anything approaching to content. Perhaps from the golden harvest of life's best gifts he too had reaped but one thing \u2014 disappointment! Methinks I read down into every heart here present, and see it likewise. Let the happy one whom it has never touched say so ! Alas ! I fear not the contradiction of any. \"Disappointment, the universal doom!"], [17, "11 VERONIA. And yet man was intended to be happy. How comes it then that he is so wretched ? How comes it that the more passionate the yearning for this happiness, the more in exorable the denial ? Brethren, I will tell you ; though the tale is old, the whole his tory of humanity attests its truth, and the wisdom of ages has echoed it. \" There was a time when all that the poets have imagined of beauty, rapture, and fruition was lavished on the happy beings who were their Creator's last work, and His best, j Paradise was their home, angels were their guardians, the Eternal One Himself was their guest. The scene changed. Fallen powers overshadowed them, the Divine presence was withdrawn, a curse supplied its place. A subtle voice had whispered that at the price of disobedience they should know ' good from evil,' and the punishment which that disobedience drew down was the mortal blindness \u2014 which can distinguish neither \u2014 that has cursed man kind ever since. Thus sin had produced error, and error sin ! So was constituted a vicious circle, and in it the sons of Adam have never ceased to move. All things had blended in harmony with the Divine will"], [18, "12 VERONIA. that gave them being, until the heart of man became discordant with it. It lost the key note and confusion ensued, until One came who took it up again \u2014 that One was Christ! \" A great poet has described an imagin ary moment in the life of our Mother Eve, when she first beholds her own gracious image reflected in a stream, and he has painted with matchless grace the emotions awakened in her at once of childlike admira tion and surprise at her own beauty. \" Something most similar to this, my brethren, takes place in the regenerated heart of man, when he first looks upon his own soul as mirrored in the love of Christ. Then, indeed, does her celestial nature assert itself so powerfully as to make the harsh realities by which it has before been blinded recede away like a mist, leaving her free to spring aloft into her own pure element of divine imaginings. Bright and glorious are the things which then break on her vision ; seraphic the harmony which pervades and is felt as a part of the divine structure of her being. Under their influence how serenely does she look down upon the pomps, the best glories, and the temptations of humanity, seeing in them but a vapour, the shadow of"], [19, "13 VERONIA. a shade ! For her conceptions of felicity are now such that nothing earth can offer remotely answers either to her expectations or her wants. This is the great secret of man's unhappiness ; he applies a thousand remedies to the disease, but never the true one. It is as though, through ignorance, we should pour rich essences over a perish ing exotic, thinking thereby to nourish and revive it. Would any of these, think you, supply to it the place of one drop of pure, sweet water, the element it loves and thirsts for? No! \" Such, then, as water to this plant, is to the soul of man the mysterious element called grace. This is the only element wherein it can rejoice, because the only one in which its highest aspirations find their end and their completion ; the only one producing rapture unfollowed by satiety, freedom unaccompanied by regret. \" And this grace, this favour \u2014 whence comes it ? \"Ah! too lost, too wretched, to have won it for ourselves, One loved us, and gave Himself for us, that we might regain that lost key of a forfeited eternity. \"Eternity! Yes; it is the fashion in"], [20, "14 VERONIA. these days to speak smilingly of it as a medieval myth \u2014 a mere poetic image ; but, oh ! my brethren, eternity is only another word in God's vocabulary for an everlasting present ; when the past shall have withered up as a scroll, and the future be ever with us. \" Eternity ! which of us, at life's outset, has not imagined it to himself? The love of our first youth, was it not to endure for ever ? The fame for which we panted, was it not to be boundless and everlasting ? These, indeed, perhaps have faded like a dream, but there are others which have not done so. The memory of a wrong inflicted or received, is it not with us yet ? \u2014 fresh, cruel, living, as if of yesterday, though years perhaps have passed over it? There are some things, you see, even in this life, over which time has no empire, which she cannot efface ; why, then, doubt of her sister-power, eternity ? \" Could we touch with a wand the long buried dead, and bid them arise, with the first pulse of each heart would re-awaken one thought, one memory, or one regret, which death itself had failed to annihilate ; and one \u2014 the deepest one among them \u2014 wouldhave incorporated itself with the being,"], [21, "VERONIA. 15 so as to have become a part of it \u2014 a thing indivisible for evermore.

The guilty and remorseful, though unrepentant, have looked shudderingly along its awful vista, and tried vainly afterwards to shut it out ; the eyes of faith and sorrow, in resting on it, have drunk in at one glance the ecstasy of fruition. Eternity, oh, eternity ! Man is but a worm \u2014 growing up like the flower of the field, and cut down at evening like its grass \u2014 yet, for this has the Creator des tined him the most helpless, abject, and sinful of his creatures ! \" So, brethren, if you have gleaned from my story why I dare to echo the apostle's glorious words, let the lesson serve you, and, as you love your own souls, turn, turn, while it is yet time, to Him who died to merit us salvation, and, let the sacrifice cost what it may, believe on the faith of the poor monk who addresses you, that you, too, shall, without doubt, be able to \" rejoice with joy unspeakable and glorious\" unto eternity.\""], [22, "16 CHAPTER II.

Enigma of enigmas to the simple, we say again, and which he only who watches from afar dispassionately, and with a patience greater, doubtless, than the object of it deserves, comes finally to guess at, perhaps to understand. An exemplification of our meaning pre sents itself without much search. The church of St. Sulpice was crowded on one Sunday morning in the latter part of May, and the bell was giving forth its last tones in announcement of high mass, when, through the well-filled aisles the gorgeous Suisse who then held that office in the above mentioned parish, was seen preceding, with an augmentation of his usual pomposity, a superlatively crinolined, magnificently attired, and every way impos- vol. in. c"], [24, "18 VERONIA. ing female figure, which subsided \u2014 at the moment the official bowed low before it \u2014 into a ruby velvet cushioned prie-dieu and the attitude of prayer. The superb dress, jewelled hands, and generally splendid exterior, though suffi ciently explaining the profound homage paid by the Suisse to their owner, may scarcely be sufficient to secure that of the ingenious reader, unless some further details are subjoined. Madame de St. Bartelemy \u2014 for such was the gorgeous lady's name \u2014 was not only one of the richest, but one of the most ex emplary and pattern ornaments of the parish which she honoured by her presence. It was her piety that decked its altars, upheld its convents, watched over its con fraternities, feasted its clergy, and generally patronised it in every way, for, as might have been expected of so magnificent a lady, \"patronage\" was her very element, the breath of her nostrils, the one object for which of course a discriminating Providence had gifted her so largely. It was not to be supposed that Heaven would permit its designs in this respect to be frustrated by any want of perception on the part of the"], [25, "19 VERONIA. recipient of its honours, and, consequently, Madame de St. Bartelemy had ever recog nized, acknowledged, and appreciated to the full her vocation as lady-patroness to every thing particular within her range, and every thing in general beyond it. That there were some few ignorant and perverse persons who occasionally resisted the forcible imposition of the honour of this patronage upon them is not to be denied. Such intractable specimens of humanity there ever will be in the world, but it is only justice to society to state that the majority of its members bowed like the suisse most meekly to the golden sceptre, and did homage before it. To a looker-on, unconscious of these claims upon his veneration, Madame de St. Bartelemy, as she leant now ecstatically over her ruby-coloured prie-dieu, might have seemed scarcely to realize the ideal of re finement, while to the man of taste, the glaring pink silk dress, the big diamond, heading a host of others on her chubby fore-finger, and his brother emerald, lustily calling attention to himself on the second one, would have appeared hardly in keep ing with the sacred precincts where they c 2"], [26, "20 VERONIA. were displayed, or in accordance with a modest Christian woman'sbelief in the solemn mysteries about to be celebrated on its altar. Lookers-on, however, for the most part, knew her for the wealthy and devout orna ment of the parish, and men of taste, if any such there happened to be present, would have turned away from her massive person and heavy countenance without being tempted to survey their auxiliaries. Yet it would be unfair to say that Madame de St. Bartelemy was ill-looking. So far from it that she was decidedly a fine woman, had smooth, handsome features, large Juno-like eyes, teeth and hair in per fect preservation for her age \u2014 which, in deed, was not alarmingly past forty \u2014 and a glowing skin, whose tints the contrast of all the warm colours which she wore could scarcely subdue. Still, if Bacon's observation be true, there was one essential quality wanting, for she possessed assuredly no charm which a neat draughtsman and good colourist could not have transferred to canvas with perfect justice to the original, and, says the moralist, \" that is the best part of beauty which a picture cannot express.\""], [27, "VERONIA. 21 Ill-natured people might have suspected that the companion who crept so submis sively after her, seeming to regulate her very attitude at different parts of the ser vice by those of Madame de St. Bartelemy, had been chosen as a foil, so complete a contrast did her personal appearance offer to that of her patroness. The reader may draw his own conclusions when we mention that this companion has already been pre sented to him in Monsieur Bouchard's office. On the evening of the same day which had witnessed her devotions in St. Sulpice, Madame de St. Bartelemy's draw ing-room was filled by the usual guests who each Sunday assembled there, of whom a large proportion were clergy of a superior grade. Her reason for selecting Sunday as her principal day of reception was indeed that of its being the only one of partial leisure to the ecclesiastical body, whom she favoured above all others. On the evening in question we find again most of those persons whom we have already seen at the Duke de Rochefierre's residence, besides a few more who have not yet been formally presented to the reader. One of these was now leaning, in"], [28, "22 VERONIA. thoroughly British attitude, against the cor ner of the velvet-draped mantel-piece, in an angle of which was placed the chair of Madame de St. Bartelemy, and in which her massive person at this moment reclined. Her head reposed on a crimson cushion, chosen evidently with reference to her com plexion ; and her hands \u2014 laden as usual with splendid rings of the most striking contrast \u2014 were elevated and joined, so as to show them to the best advantage. The individual we have above alluded to was a man \u2014 somewhat under thirty years of age, possessed of a fine person, an open, agreeable countenance, and air of natural distinction. He might to many have appeared handsome, but that the ex cessive self-complacency which characterized him \u2014 although not absolutely trenching upon the limits of good breeding \u2014 detracted somewhat from the interest he would other wise have inspired. The consciousness and pre-eminent love of self which sparkled in his grey eyes was confirmed by the full, irresolute lips, and the half careless, half important character of the smile with which he was now listening to the conversation of his hostess. He was the very man to ap-"], [29, "VERONIA. 23 pear to advantage in plaid and tartan \u2014 a gallant specimen of the Scottish chieftain, and well calculated to have excited the en thusiastic admiration of the hot-headed little artist as whose patron, Sir Douglas Douglas, of Dragonhall, he has already been mentioned. \"You must really promise me, Sir Douglas, that you will be of our party. I am sure that cold Albion will not be properly thawed until the dog-days begin, and I have answered for you to the rest of my guests.\" \" Does madame forget the London sea son ?\" inquired the smiling baronet ; \" that is of necessity, as the French say, unfor tunately, for I cannot compare it for an instant with the pleasure I should derive from accepting this most agreeable offer ! I have heard the chateau is magnificent.\" \" A nice place, certainly, as it should be for the five thousand pounds it cost me,\" answered the lady, trying to assume a care less air; \"but to speak of yourself, Sir Douglas, why cannot you go over for your season, and return to us afterwards ? \" \"Delightful! I should like nothing better. De Boisvante tells me there is fine sport in your forest \u2014 is it true ? \""], [30, "24 VERONIA. \" Perfectly,\" replied the hostess, half smiling at this characteristic speech. \" Monsieur de Boisvante\" will make up any sporting parties you like, and I can mount you, so you need bring no stud.\" \"Thanks, madame!\" And this time it was the Briton's turn to smile. \" You are too good. Monsieur de St. Gregoire is no sportsman, I believe ? \" \" No ; the Marquis's tastes are literary and scientific, but he is also to be \"with us for some time. Monseigneur, too, has promised me a visit.\" And she glanced complacently towards the ecclesiastical dig nitary whom we have before mentioned as frequenting the Duke de Rochefierre's society. \" A distinguished circle, indeed,\" said Sir Douglas, seeing what was expected of him, \" and I am sensible, madame, of the honour of being included in it, That gentleman standing near Madame de Mont Brison\u2014 is he not also one of your expected guests ? \" \"The Comte de Briedieu. Oh! yes, poor young man !

Truly, madame, you have made a charming selection, and I am more and more flattered to be of the number.\" \"Not more so, Sir Douglas, than we shall be to include you in it,\" graciously replied the lady; \" I have sent out no further invitations at present, but it is possible I may do so by the time you come ; distinc tion is what I chiefly seek in my guests ; one must be select, you know, in these days more than ever \u2014 the spirit of democracy is making such fearful inroads upon society.\" \"It is, indeed,\" replied the baronet, innocent of suspecting that the fair speaker's extraction should have kept her silent on this point, although she betrayed"], [32, "26 VERONIA. it, indeed, in a thousand ways, which a more observant person or one of her own nation would have easily detected. \" It is indeed ; and what is more extraordinary, is to see men of good birth yielding to it.

He looked at the calm, severe brow and lofty counte nance with wonder that the man to whom they belonged could be so contemptible a time-server as this anecdote seemed to indicate ; but the Scotsman's craft came, with a moment's reflection, to enlighten him. Might there not be a less ignoble motive for conciliating this pretentious owner of house and land ? Surely. And if anything had been wanting to explain it, the look with which the Count had just presented his companion with a flower fallen from her bouquet would have done so.

He had scarcely reached them and saluted the lady, before De St. Gregoire and De Boisvante\" joined the group. \" You have consented, of course, Sir Douglas,\" said Herminie, in whose Parisian bosom had sprung up the characteristic wish to torture the poor Count by means of a new rival \u2014 an idea suggested, perhaps, by the frank admiration of her charms, which she had read in the Briton's eyes ; \" we shall be a delightful party, and I quite wish the time was come.\" \" My engagements, madame, ought to have made me decline Madame de St. Bartelemy's too tempting invitation ; but being only mortal I had no strength to resist so many attractions,\" said the Baronet, with a warmth of earnestness which made the poor Count shiver. \" Can I, meanwhile, be of any ser vice to you in London ; I am going to con clude the season there, and shall leave now in a short time.\" \" I think not, Sir Douglas, thank you ; our little Paris supplies us pretty well with"], [35, "29 VERONIA. all we wish for, unless, indeed, it is with bull-dogs,\" said Herminie, demurely ; \" cer tainly, I should like one of those, if it was very, very savage \u2014 a real thorough-bred.\" \" Madame I\" exclaimed the terrified Count, turning as pale as death from horror and jealousy combined, \" do you know what you are asking ? \u2014 It is impossible Sir Douglas can consent.\" \" If madame particularly wishes it,\" answered the Baronet, repressing his smiles to favour Herminie in the joke, \" I have nothing left but to obey.

The peculiar conformation of his jaw is such that it is a question, when once his fangs are set in any object, how far he possesses the power to relinquish it again. This makes him, indeed \u2014 though not the most excitable \u2014 by far the most formidable of dogs; yet, if madame still wishes for a favourite of this description, I cannot refuse her request, as Monsieur de Briedieu must ac knowledge with me that we the inferior half of creation were formed only to obey ; \" and the glance and smile with which Sir Douglas bowed to Herminie completed her lover's discomfiture to that degree that he almost abruptly quitted the group, and soon after disappeared for the evening. \" Poor Count,\" said St. Gregoire, half seriously. \" Are you not rather cruel,"], [37, "VERONIA. 31 madame ; those poets, you know, are such creatures of imagination, that I have no doubt he has seen and realized, by this time, some dreadful tragedy, of which you are the heroine.

Dr. Bonnet's house was situated in a vast and sombre street, at some distance from the more central ones of Bruges. Had the doctor been a family man, it is possible he might have chosen a less gloomy spot in which to dwell ; but having no other choice than his own to consult, long past that period of life when outward things exercise an influence over the feelings, and older even in character than in years, he caredlittle for that deprivation of sunshine and cheer fulness which would have fallen so depress ingly on most other natures. Remarkable for his devotion to science, and the austere rigidity of his life and habits, study and the practice of all the revolting details of his profession, seemed to form the sole objects of his thoughts and existence ;"], [39, "VERONIA. 33 we say seemed, for in truth there was a no less deep and absorbing one ; one, which had indeed become with him a fixed prin ciple \u2014 that object was religion. His home was sad, situated, as we have said, on the shady side of a dark street, whose silence was rarely broken by the sound or sight of human movement, a damp, chill atmosphere which hung around it completed the dreary impression which its aspect never failed to leave upon the stran ger's mind. On a raw evening not long after Goden sca's visit to Carl Dopter, the artist might have been seen approaching this dwelling. The peculiar look he cast upon its dull walls and closely-curtained windows, as he mounted the steps and rang the bell, suffi ciently expressed that, at least, his lively fancy was thus affected by it; and the usual whistle with which he beguiled the rather long interval which elapsed before his sum mons was answered, unlike what was usual with him, unconsciously took a low and mournful key. The door was at length opened by an ancient domestic in a very faded suit, who, according to a principle which seems to pre- VOL. III. D"], [40, "34 VERONIA. vail among long-kept servants, wore an ad mirably imitated reflection of his master's grave demeanour, deepened by not a little importance of his own. Conducting Dop ter into a vast parlour in the rear of the building, and bidding him, with dignity, be seated, he left the visitor to his own reflections. In keeping with the exterior of the dwell ing, the chamber in which the artist found himself was chill and gloomy. Its massive and old-fashioned furniture was swathed in coverings of a dark fantastic chintz, which added to the lugubrious effect, and harmo nized austerely with its lofty ceiling, deep casements, and panelled walls. Carl Dopter's spirit sank, oppressed by the deep stillness and soberness of all around, The reflection struck him of how frequently this external solemnity formed, as it were, a kind of atmosphere round pious people of a certain stamp, kindred apparently to their sympathies, and often inseparable from them, and the wild, reckless, but harmless fellow thought, as many another misguided soul has thought before him, how very uninvit ing a place must be the heaven of these good people, if it at all resembled the state of things they affected upon earth."], [41, "VERONIA. 35 A tall dark shadow gliding to his side startled him from these reflections, and, to his surprise, for he had heard no footstep, on looking round he perceived the master of the house. Dr. Bonnet, as usual, was habited in the professional black suit and white neckcloth, and his countenance wore the same impene trable coldness it ever did. He did not in vite Dopter to resume the seat from which the latter had risen, but remained standing, as if his moments were too precious to waste in conversation, which in truth they were. \" There is nothing the matter, I hope, at home, Carl Dopter,\" he said, as the artist, overawed by external things and the doctor's sudden entrance, saluted him more seriously than usual. \" Is your wife well? \" \" Quite well, Meinheer Doctor \u2014 remark ably well, thank you, and the baby too. It was on quite a different subject from a professional one that I came to speak to you, if you are at leisure for a few mo ments,\" said Carl, less confidently than usual, and turning his hat round rather restlessly in his hands. \" Well, sit down then, I will spare you a few minutes,\" and the physician pointed to- d2"], [42, "36 VERONIA. wards a chair, and seated himself at the same time. \" I beg your pardon, meinheer, but I thought it was after business hours, or I wouldn't have disturbed you,\" said Dopter, meekly, beginning to feel rather timid, and perhaps a little depressed, at seeing no signs of the glass and the pipe which Van Helder never failed to offer when he came. \" Oh ! if you waited until I had an idle hour you might wait a long time, Mr. Carl,\" said the Doctor, with the grim smile he sometimes permitted himself, doubtless as are laxation; \"but what, pray, can I do for you?\" \" Nothing, meinheer ; indeed I have come to thank you for what you have already done, as, the fact is, I \u2014 we \u2014 are leav ing the country.\" \" Leaving the country ! Indeed ! are you returning to that of your wife ? \" \" No, we are going off the continent alto gether \u2014 to Edinburgh, the capital of Scot land, you know.\" \" To Edinburgh ! in the name of wonder, why ? \" \" Well, the fact is, meinheer,\" and as often happens to those of his temperament,"], [43, "37 VERONIA, on having to explain his motives of action to a more matter of fact, severe person than himself, the artist for the first time doubted of them himself, \" the fact is, that I have been so fortunate as to find a patron \u2014 the British noble to whom you were so good as to present me yourself \u2014 a munificent encourager of art, who has made me the most liberal offers, if I will put my time at his disposal, on his return from Italy, whence he is shortly expected. He has a magnificent gallery in his mansion near Edinburgh, which requires restoring and putting to rights, and will afford work for a year at the very least, he tells me, and as work is often slack here, where you know artists, or so-called artists, swarm, of course I have not hesitated to accept so very desirable an engagement.\" \"Well, you are really a most sensible, prudent person, and most admirably fitted to be the father of a family and master of a household,\" exclaimed Dr. Bonnet, roused to greater energy of gesture and language than Dopter had ever witnessed from him be fore. \" So, after marrying this poor young woman, which was the most foolish business I ever heard of, you are going to take a step"], [44, "38 VERONIA. which will reduce both her and yourself to starvation \u2014 well, well ! \" \" It was perhaps rather foolish of me to marry in such a hurry, I confess, but then, in fact, Gretchen, as you may perhaps have observed, Meinheer Doctor, is a most engag ing little creature, and I thought, too, how beautifully she would come into my pictures as Psyche, Aurora, or the like, and what an economy that would be in the article of models, don't you see ? \" And convinced of the favourable impression, which the severely practical nature of this argument could not fail to have upon the mind of his listener, Dopter now looked more confidently up into his face for approval. \" Are you demented, Carl Dopter, to speak thus?\" said Bonnet, impatiently, \"would any man in his senses think ot leaving his own country, where he has friends and employment, however humble, yet regularly paid, for a foreign land, and a 'wild-goose chase ? Let me hear no more of such folly,\" and he rose as if to give emphasis to his words. Carl rose also, but wounded vanity had stung him to resistance. \" I beg your pardon, doctor, but those"], [45, "39 VERONIA. who don't make a study of art can't pos sibly be judges of what an artist has a right to expect, I feel it due to myself not to sit down in the obscurity which my friends '' \u2014 he emphasised the word bitterly \u2014 \"seem to think good enough for me ! Some day, per haps, they will see their error,\" and he turned proudly towards the door. \" Stay, Carl Dopter. and listen to a word before you go,\" interrupted the doctor, stepping before him ; \" if you are so mad you will repent it, mark my words. I am an old man, I know something of the world, and I warn you that misery, starvation, and deception will be your fate, as they have been that of others, who have cast away a reality for an illusion.\" But exasperated at what he conceived the insult to his talents, as well as judgment, conveyed in this speech, Dopter moved away. The austere prophet looked after him with a mingled glance of pity and contempt, which was not lost upon the object of it, and not a little heightened his sense of wrong. But though this unqualified declaration of opinion respecting his unfitness for the responsibilities attached to the character of husband and father, had, as we have seen."], [46, "40 VERONIA, appeared to the artist a groundless and wicked calumny, invented at pleasure, for the sole purpose of stinging him into vexa tion, yet, that it had a better foundation, the reader will probably by this time have discovered. Too thoughtless to reflect for a moment on the severe consequences such a proceeding might entail upon his wife and child, Dop ter embarked at Ostend for Leith, during a season of unusual bad weather, when storms were raging and disasters occurring at sea. Their voyage, however, though rough, was free from accident, and only exceeded by a few hours its usual duration, yet was poor Gretchen in sad case long before its ter mination. A compassionate fellow-passenger in the steerage, who was herself not a little dis tressed by the rolling of the vessel, had pity upon her weaker neighbour, and took from her the poor baby, whose wants the sick mother was in no condition to supply, and, making interest for a little milk and water, fed it at intervals, and hushed its disturbed cries, while offering from time to time rough consolation to Gretchen, in a dialect of which the latter of course understood not"], [47, "41 VERONIA. one word. Carl, too, hovered near, distracted at the first result of his experiment, and swearing repeatedly that never should his Gretchen cross the sea again. Poor com fort, when all she loved lay beyond it ; but who, under the influence of that hideous sickness, has a thought, a feeling, a sensa tion for anything besides? So his young wife listened, without gleaning the mean ing of his words, but soothed amid her pangs by the sound of his beloved voice, and the presence of his loving eyes. Fortunately for both, Carl could muster a little English, and contrived to extract from their fellow voyager the imformation that, if Edinburgh was their destination, she knew of a lodging to let by a friend of her own, and would, on landing, direct them to it \u2014 which offer was thankfully grasped at by Dopter. \"It's awa up the Canongate, but ye'U no mind that, maybe,\" said she, \" they're braw folk as keep the house ; \" to which and a great deal more Carl responded by incessant nods and smiles, pleased at the prospect of getting Gretchen housed at once. Grasping his cicerone tightly by the arm, as if to prevent her escape, and showing her"], [48, "42 VERONIA. a handful of silver coin, earnest of his means of supplying all demands, Carl, on landing, hurried her, with his wife and child, into an omnibus proceeding I straight to the city, and then, as the baby's cries were hushed by its being restored to its natural resting place, and Gretchen, faint and speech less, but relieved from actual suffering, leant on his shoulder, he had, for the first time, leisure to look around, and reconnoitre. The vehicle had traversed Leith, and taken the long road that leads to Edin burgh, and, it being yet early, the clear air permitted a long range to the eye. To the right lay the city ; its thousand chimneys and spires all glittering beneath the yet unsullied morning sky, on whose azure depths still floated a few light pearly clouds. Further on might be traced the dark towers of Holyrood, which no sunshine could light up, but Carl Dopter's eye marked it all the same, and dwelt musingly upon it.

Thoughtless though he was, the artist's instinct of enthusiasm would have awoke in Dopter at this moment, but for the vex ing torments of the present ; yet even now his glance rested admiringly on the scene, and when it wandered thence it turned with no less pleasure to the grand outline of mountain which forms a fitting back ground to the picture. Sharply against the blue sky stood out the picturesque cliffs of Salisbury Craigs, whose pointed outline forms a bold contrast to the smooth and grassy sward which clothes the majestic heights of Arthur's Seat. \" How glorious ! \" fell from the lips of Dopter, as he turned to share the feeling with poor Gretchen, who still lay exhausted on his shoulder. \" Can't you look up, my bird of paradise, and see the beautiful place we're coming to ? \" \" Na, na, puir body, not she,\" remarked the honest Scotchwoman, who had no ticed with pride his admiration ; \" but it's a braw place our citie, sure eno' \u2014 have ye nae got some friends here ? \""], [50, "44 VERONIA. \"No,\" said Carl, \"not friends exactly, only a patron.\" \"Carl, love, shall we soon arrive?\" murmured Gretchen, faintly ; \" I feel so ill, so very ill, and baby, too ; for his sake I want rest.\" \" Soon, darling, very soon now ; we are nearing the city, then we shall get a lodging directly, and I will nurse you and baby too. See, he has become himself again since we left the ship ; look at him, little mother, he is all alive.\" For an instant she raised her eyes, but all swam before them, and caused her a deadly faintness, which frightened Dopter, as he clasped her more closely in his arms. When he next looked up the vehicle had stopped, the door was opened, and the Scotchwoman, who had explained to the conductor where she wished to go, now assisted him to get Gretchen and the baby out. Their luggage was placed beside them, and the conveyance drove off. Carl looked up in surprise, mingled with con sternation at the scene around him, a scene which those who have witnessed it need not undoubtedly to have recalled to their memory, and of which, to those who have"], [51, "VERONIA. 45 not done so, all description would fall short of the reality. Suffice it to say they were in the heart of the Canongate, and as he gazed up at the tall houses on either side, and then looked at the fragile creature leaning on him, for the first time the heart of the imprudent artist sank heavily within him."], [52, "46 CHAPTER IV. \" Wonders will never cease,\" said Van Helder, arriving one day, breathless, flushed, and excited at the Presbytery, and stalk ing straight into the Curb's sanctum, where the good man sat alone. \" Why, what is the news now, Jean ?

I see now he was right.\" \" Dr. Bonnet ! he is a Protestant, surely,\" said the Cure, in surprise. \" Just so, and this is what made him so clear-sighted ; he viewed the case philoso phically, no doubt, and it is surprising how exactly his calculations have proved correct ' \" Which will not please him, however, I suspect,\" said the Cure, with a smile; \"I have heard he is very bigoted. \" Well like most who are called ' pious people,' he thinks that all those who differ from him are likely to enjoy the benefit of"], [54, "48 VERONIA. an extra warm climate on reaching the next world.

The shadow which purely moral causes throw over a man, often, how ever, ends by effecting great changes in his physical condition as well.

He was sensi tive, too, and if I hadn't been there when each picture was done, I believe there it would have hung upon his wall for ever. A good deal of his time was devoted of course to the old masters, but sometimes he would dash off a spirited sea-piece of his own, which I then undertook to sell ; and this is the way I managed it. I used to get a book full of criticisms on the art, and read them up for the purpose, which would have been an excellent plan, only that when it came to the point, and I was standing with some pursy ignoramus or other before the subject to be disposed of, I used to re peat my lesson all wrong. You should have heard me, Paul, cantering recklessly through technicalities and transposing words in the most frantic manner, dilating on squareness of tone, beautiful confusion of tinting, masterly plastering, &c, while Henricart, whom I had often withdrawn from the scene and placed behind some curtain with strict orders not to stir till all was over, listened, as he afterwards told me, sick with suppressed laughter.\""], [62, "56 VERONIA. *\u25a0 \" I only hope,\" said the smiling Cure, \"that you didn't perjure yourself, Jean, or get more than an honest price for the pic tures after all.\" \"No fear, no fear; they were thought well of by competent judges, and as to being extortionate, why, in these days it's the only way of getting anything at all ; the haggling of some of those old million aires could not have been surpassed if the article had been old goods at a Jew broker's ; they seemed to consider the artist in the light of an upholsterer who must be beaten down. Jacques, with all his sensitiveness and fine feeling would never have got on without me, I can tell you. The aristo cratic dictum is, that ' it takes three genera tions to make a gentleman,' but if Jacques Henricart has not in him all the elements of one, the very term is an illusion and a lie.\" \" What matters,\" said the placid Cure, \" if he is an honest man ; is there not one of the foreign poets who says :* ' An honest man's the noblest work of God,' surely that ought to be a proud title enough for any man.\" \" Yes, but poetry is one thing and prose * The reader will remember it is a foreigner who speaks."], [63, "57 VERONIA. another; the noblest work of Omni potence is not always that which is the most appreciated by the world ; though it may accept the metal as genuine, it likes to put its own stamp upon it notwithstanding.\" Of course, if the Cure had not started it, Van Helder would himself have pursued the other line of argument ; but to side even with his best friend in a discussion was out of the question. The priest only smiled quietly. \" Henricart's case,\" continued the Doctor, unobservant of the smile, \"is just this, that all his noble qualities are outweighed in the eyes of the superficial \u2014 who compose three fourths of society \u2014 by his peculiarities. His mingled pride and diffidence, his reserve and want of sociability go much against him \u2014 it can hardly be otherwise. The secret of his character is disappointment ; whatever may have been his early prospects, there can be no doubt he has failed in realizing them, and that, I am equally persuaded, by no want of ardour on his own part ; yet the result is the same, for, as Reynaud says, ' a vocation suppressed is an intellectual mutila tion.' The victim's very faculties are turned against him.\" \" In that I quite agree with you,\" answered"], [64, "58 VERONIA. the priest ; \" but do you think, then, that Henricart's natural calling was not that which he now follows.\" \" Possibly not more than that of half the men we meet \u2014 than yours or mine, for in stance, would have been, Paul, had we not struggled manfully as we both did ; and think, for a moment, of yourself charging the enemy at the head of a body of cavalry, and of me walking compulsively into a confessional surrounded by a crowd of eager penitents waiting to be shriven \u2014 remarkably pleasant we should each look, under the cir cumstances !

Trifles showed me this \u2014 his unsoci ability confirmed it."], [65, "59 VERONIA. \" Yes, that is indeed strong evidence of an ill-regulated if not disordered mind,\" said the priest, thoughtfully, \" we can scarcely have a stronger one.\" \" No, this is a common error ; a man need not as has been falsely said, be either a god or a beast to cherish solitude ; he may be merely either a very ill-used member of the human family, or, at least, have reason to think himself so, which comes, in its re sults, to the same thing \u2014 in fact, I believe that it is the very tenderest and finest natures, the most perfectly human ones, so to speak, that run the soonest to this ex treme. For, granting even that, in society, the good element predominates over the evil one \u2014 that its tendency is rather conciliatory than destructive ; that kindness, in a word, enters more largely than cruelty into its dispensations \u2014 even so, I maintain, that, as at present constituted, it is, to many, a source of far more pain than comfort. How many wounds it probes relentlessly, perhaps unknowingly ! How many a stab is given, under which the victim dare not wince !\" \" These,\" said the Cure, \" are the feelings of a misanthrope, or, at best, a man unfitted, by some mental or physical infirmity, to"], [66, "60 VERONIA. mingle with his fellows. To the upright, healthy-minded man, human intercourse, be sides being pleasant, is an absolute necessity of his nature ; certainly he who avoids it is always an exceptional or too sensitive being.\" \" Too sensitive, perhaps,\" answered Van Helder ; \" yet, without exactly avoiding it, how many endure it, as it were, under pro test ! And this view alone explains peculiari ties which we often witness and wonder at. Such a man, for instance, is so passionate an amateur of his pipe, that he seems truly calm and satisfied only when indulging in it ; such a woman, on the other hand, shuns music, flowers, children, or other things which are universally admitted to be objects of attraction to the rest of her sex. What are these peculiarities but symptoms of some occult suffering, from which the former finds a reprieve only in the indulgence I have mentioned, and which is too vividly recalled to the latter by that which, under other conditions, would charm. You may say that such ideas are fanciful ; but I contend that they are not so.\" \"I must differ with you, Jean ; this man and woman, I should say, belong undoubtedly to the fanciful species, of which you won't"], [67, "VERONIA. 61 deny that there are plenty in the world. Dear me, it is quite evident.\" \" Poor souls !\" ejaculated the Doctor, with a deep sigh, \" what says the exponent of my favourite philospher?\" \" ' Man desires happiness, and fears suffer ing. There are three means only by which he can enjoy or suffer. First \u2014 indepen dently of his relations with humanity \u2014 in his own person, or his contact with the natural world. Secondly, in his particular relations with those of his fellows who are more or less intimately brought into con nection with him. Thirdly, in his more general relations with society.' These are the three sources whence flow good or evil; the three entries from which springs pleasure or pain. This being so, surely it follows as a natural consequence that, constituted as society now is, the channels whence pain flows are vast and deep. Instead of wondering there are so many discontented, we should rather be astonished that there are so many resigned.'\" \" Ah ! my dear Jean, if you want to carry me away with your philosopher, I shall retreat ; forgive me, but I have really too little imagination to enjoy fables.\""], [68, "62 VERONIA. \" The fables and the visions of one age become the facts and practices of a succeed ing age,\" quoted Van Helder, solemnly. The priest shrugged his shoulders and smiled. \" Well my dear friend, I think we are at all events pretty sure that you and I will be in another world before that comes true of your theory.\" And so the discussion ended."], [69, "63 CHAPTER V. \" Come, Herminie, will you never be ready? You know the Duke dislikes late hours.\" \" In one moment,\" answered the lady, who was standing before a mirror in her boudoir, while the lady's-maid effected some alteration in her head-dress, attempt ing vainly to make a spray of clematis fall in the direction that its wearer desired; \" You are so tiresome, Adrian, that I wish you would not fetch me another time. But what has induced my uncle to receive to night ? It is not his evening.\" \" Come, and you will see,\" answered the young man; \"there, that will do admirably, Natalie,\" \u2014 to the maid \u2014 \" permit me to say, Madame de Mont Brison, that I never saw you look more charming; you need fear no comparisons, believe me,\" and a mischievous gleam shot from his eyes."], [70, "64 VERONIA. \"Not where we are going, certainly,\" laughed his cousin, \"unless you think Madame de St. Bartelemy a dangerous rival? She is there, I suppose.\" \" Yes, yes, this hour and more ; are you coming ? \" \" Now,\" and putting her arm within his own the fair widow allowed herself to be led from the mirror, that shrine at which her devotions were most assiduously paid. \" Ah ! what a surprise ! \" exclaimed she aside to her companion, as the doors of the Duke's drawing-room were thrown open, disclosing that nobleman seated at his whist table, with Madame de St. Bartelemy as partner, on his right hand side the Admiral, and on the opposite one no less a person than Van Helder. \" The knight of the rueful countenance himself; when did he arrive?\" \" This evening, and not alone ; look again,\" was the whispered reply. Herminie obeyed, and her start and change of colour, as she did so, betrayed the emotion which she was not able entirely to subdue. Near the old nobleman sat a lady, the delicate pallor of whose thoughtful features was more strikingly enhanced by the deep"], [71, "VERONIA 65 mourning which she wore. The rich dark hair simply parted, the pencilled eyebrows and sweeping lids, all added to the stateliness of her beauty. Seen thus in repose, her face had something of that statuesque character which much grief imparts, at last, to the most sensitive and expressive ones, and every feature revealed in its own language the austere traces of suffering ; all, indeed, save the mouth, whose calm, sweet lips and dawning smile amply redeemed whatever marred the softness of the other features by their testimony that, though error might have overshadowed, evil at least had never tainted the soul to which they belonged. And that testimony was worth all, for, though all the other features combined to deceive, the mouth could never wholly join in their perfidy ! \" Ah ! Herminie ! \" said the Duke, in a gentle though somewhat reproachful tone, as she approached the table ; \" we have been expecting you some time. Permit me, my dear niece, to present you to Madame de Mont Brison, my adopted daughter, I may say,\" he added, with a smile. \" Mademoi selle de Mehul, my dear Herminie.\" And he courteously smiled to each.

Veronia rose, and the air with which she put her hand into that which Herminie thought herself obliged to offer her, as well as the smile which accompanied it, struck with a stab of jealous pain into the co quette's heart. This was, then, the woman whom Adrian declared that he had never loved \u2014 it was impossible ! They moved away together to a neigh bouring couch, and glancing involuntarily at the mirror which overhung it, Herminie's discomfiture increased. Though well-proportioned in height and figure as compared with most Parisians \u2014 whose physical advantages in these respects are rare \u2014 Madame de Mont Brison's person shrank to insignificance beside the nobler one of Veronia. The perfect outline, the classic features, the Roman dignity of look and carriage \u2014 to rival these she possessed only the peach-like glow of youthful beauty, and if its fairest, yet its most passing charms. Many a woman, indeed, with such would have thought herself richly dowered, and few of the other sex but would have given them the preference ; yet for the very reason that she possessed them, Herminie"], [73, "VERONIA. 67 now doubted of their power beside those of her companion, and from that moment hated her accordingly. And how felt Veronia ? So long bereft of human joys and sym pathy, the beaming, lovely smile now bent upon her seemed like a ray of that sunshine for which she had pined so sorely. How, thought she, could so fair a crea ture be anything but kind ? How could those laughing eyes, that silvery voice, that youthful grace of manner, veil aught that was not tender, true, and good ? And thinking thus, she turned once more, with trusting eyes, and put her trembling hand spontaneously into that of the siren. \" You have met Adrian before, he tells me,\" said the latter, smilingly, impatient to explore at once the hidden depths of her companion's heart. \" How curious that neither of you should have recognized the relationship.\" A pain, keener than she could have thought possible, shot through Veronia's breast. This so suddenly presented to her was the cross she had come to meet ; with an instant's prayer for strength, she stooped in spirit, and lifted it. f2"], [74, "68 VERONIA. \" Scarcely so,\" she answered calmly, \" since we had never even remotely been informed of it. I never knew even that my dearest mother had brothers, or, conse quently, that I possessed a cousin.\" \" And when you knew Adrian thus, did you like him, or feel any of those myste rious links of sympathy which romances tell us exist unconsciously between those of the same blood ? \" asked Herminie, with the apparent simplicity of a child. Veronia looked for an instant doubtingly into the clear depths of the innocent blue eyes turned towards her, as a cruel sus picion pierced her through and through. Could he have boasted ? But no \u2014 the idea was too exquisitely painful ; and even were it so, that gay and lovely creature could not be so cruel. \" We sympathised as much as most of those who meet in the great world. I think that he is altered slightly since then \u2014 grown more serious, perhaps,\" answered Veronia, with a smile intended to hide her trepidation \u2014 '\"he used to be very lively.\" At this moment, anxious to see which way the tide was flowing, De Boisvante approached them."], [75, "69 VERONIA. \" Mademoiselle de Mehul finds you. changed, Adrian \u2014 unlike what you were when she last knew you, and less lively. Ah ! my dear cousin, what can be the reason ? \" De Boisvante at least understood the meaning look which accompanied these words, and in his turn a painful suspicion was awakened. Whether Veronia's want of self-possession or Herminie's penetration was to blame he paused not to decide, but like a true man, thought more of grati fying his vexation upon the instant than of obeying the dictates of prudence. \" I can return the compliment, if it is one,\" said he, changing colour visibly \u2014 \" Mademoiselle de Mehul is altered a little too.\" Veronia glanced at her mourning dress, settled its folds with a trembling hand, but said nothing ; the fatigue of her long jour ney, so many emotions, and the fear of betraying herself had unnerved her. Herminie bent on each alternately a cruel and triumphant glance, while Adrian, discomfited and angry, avoided meeting her eye. Fortunately the whist party at this"], [76, "70 VERONIA. moment broke up, and, glad of the oppor tunity, Veronia moved towards her uncle, whose look had seemed to invite her to re turn to his side. St. Gregoire placed a chair for her between the Duke and the Admiral, and then followed Madame de St. Bartelemy to the couch of Herminie, where Adrian still stood sulky and impatient, and drew him away. Van Helder remained leaning in a melan choly manner upon his chair, having com mitted himself too horribly in the late game to have any spirits left for conversation. \" A fine person, but wants animation; in deed I should say she will not trouble her new family long, if delicacy of complexion is any criterion,\" said Madame de St. Bar telemy to Madame de Mont Brison, in a low tone, with a glance in the direction of Veronia. \" I don't know \u2014 Adrian says she was always pale ; but, my dear friend, do you think her altogether handsome ?\" \" When you are present, my dear Her minie, it is so difficult to decide,\" replied the patroness, caressingly ; \" but no, she is too pale, and her carriage is too haughty, absurd in her position, but I suppose that"], [77, "71 VERONIA. the Duke's recognition of the tie has turned her head. It will be a sort of duty, my dear, situated as she is, to bring her to rea son, otherwise you will have all sorts of trouble with her, and Monsieur de Boisvante himself may be a sufferer.\" \" No fear, no fear,\" replied Herminie, with sparkling eyes, \"Adrian, it is true, is unworldly, and blind to his own interests very often, but while you and I are there he cannot be totally sacrificed, at least, my dear friend, I think not.\" \"^Certainly, dear, but if this new relative is une intrigante, which between ourselves \u2014 and having seen something of the world \u2014 would not at all surprise me, some skill and a few precautions will be necessary in dealing with her. She should not be left too much with the Duke, for instance, and that mourning should be got rid of as soon as practicable ; it may be a very efficacious medium of working on an old man's feelings, particularly as the case stands.\" \"Decidedly,\" answered Herminie, who, after a rapid glance at her cousin, had con cluded in her own mind that her present toilet was the best suited to Veronia's style of beauty, and must therefore be put down."], [78, "72 VERONIA. \"No one here knows when her mother died, and it is detestable therefore to be parading her affliction before us all in that fashion ; she must be talked to about it ; perhaps Adrian would be the best person.\" \"No,\" said Madame de St. Bartelemy, with that chance penetration which vulgar minds sometimes display ; \"you must take her in hand yourself, Herminie, and make her believe that the sight of her mourning is distressing to her uncle, and keeps alive his grief; that is the most likely way.\" \" Delightful, dear friend ; you are so clear-sighted \u2014 it shall be as you suggest.\" \" Well, De BoisvanteV' said the Marquis, who had stood apart with the former while the above conversation had been going on, \" accept my congratulations ; your cousin, Mademoiselle de Mehul, is the most elegant person I have seen in Paris this season ; she has a noble countenance, one of those in which the soul asserts its supremacy undeni ably.\" \" Yes, she is striking in appearance, cer tainly,\" answered the vexed Adrian, \" but not the style of person that I most admire ; too much of the Corinne about her, do you not think so ?\""], [79, "73 VERONIA. \" That arises from the shape of her head, which is perfectly classical ; I never saw anything out of marble finer,\" said St. Gregoire, forgetful of his usual languor in the interest of the theme. \" De Briedieu is certain to write an ode to her after their first meeting ; I should not wonder even if she supplanted \" \" Oh ! that is impossible,\" answered De Boisvante, understanding the allusion. \"He is so infatuated, at present, that I should not wonder, on the contrary, if, when the two are before him, he did not even notice Mademoiselle de Mehul's presence \u2014 love, they say, is subject to fits of blindness.\" \" Very bad taste it would show, in this instance, I may permit myself to say, De Boisvante^ as both the ladies are your cousins, and Mademoiselle de M^hul the nearer related of the two ; but, in truth, Madame de Mont Brison, lovely as she is, would suffer by a critical comparison.\" \" A matter of taste, Marquis, after all,\" remarked Adrian, rather dryly ; \" but ex cuse me, Madame de St. Bartelemy is rising, so I suppose her carriage is announced,\" and he hastened away to offer the lady his arm."], [80, "74 VERONIA. St. Gregoire followed, and five minutes later, the remainder of his guests having departed, the Duke, with a few gracious and flattering words, and a gentle pressure of the hand to his niece, withdrew for the night."], [81, "75 CHAPTER VI. \" Now our evening begins,\" said St. Gre goire, turning to Van Helder with his grave smile, as they stood together on the landing of the Duke's staircase, preparatory to de scending it. \" It will afford me great plea sure, monsieur, to put myself at your dis posal ; would it be agreeable to you to step into the opera for half an hour, or to go elsewhere ? \u2014 My carriage waits your orders.\" \" Dear me,\" said Van Helder, bluntly, \" very late to be capering off now, isn't it? I think I feel sleepy, Monsieur le Marquis, thank you.\" \" Well, then, you will come and smoke a cigar in my apartments before retiring to rest ; I think I can prescribe nothing more sedative, if you have no objection.\" \" Quite the reverse, monsieur ; the very"], [82, "76 VERONIA. thing I should have chosen ;\" and cheerfully preceding St. Gregoire, Van Helder descended the Duke's staircase, and jumped, without further ceremony, into the carriage which awaited them. The Marquis's hotel was situated within a short distance, so that in a few moments they found themselves comfortably ensconced in the screened recess of a large chamber on the ground floor, which was called the stu dio, from its serving as the theatre of all its owner's multifarious studies and experiments. As might have been expected, there was no elegance and little comfort in the apart ment, except in the corner where he now led his guest, and which had been parti tioned off into a sort of snuggery for his rare moments of indolent enjoyment. A chimney-piece in the corner, surmounted by a handsome mirror, was filled with a col lection of rare but scentless plants, which formed a handsome but rather severe em bellishment, and a few choice paintings of rather sombre character completed the ar rangements. From the ceiling depended a softly shaded lamp, which cast so subdued a light, as to render the general effect of all it fell on shadowy and indistinct."], [83, "VERONIA. 77 Courteously presenting Van Helder with a low and luxuriantly padded fauteuil, and sinking into another himself, the master of this retreat desired coffee to be brought, and, with an air of calm pleasure, disposed himself to commence the feast of amusement, which, it was evident the presence of his ec centric guest seemed to promise him. Van Helder, on his side, looked around him equally well pleased, as he threw himself back with the sigh which in him always in dicated complete satisfaction, and, when the door closed on the domestic, and the two men remained alone, bending over the fra grant beverage which is to be had in such perfection in Paris, this feeling found vent in words. \"What a nice hermitage, Monsieur le Marquis \u2014 this is charming ! \" St. Gregoire smiled. \"Though it may sound egotistical,\" said he, \" I confess that my pleasantest hours are passed here. Next to the happiness of married life, which I have never had the courage to try, the plea sures of a well-occupied retirement are, I think, the most solid ones. You are, I be lieve, monsieur, somewhat of my opinion ? \" \"Decidedly; those of society are the"], [84, "78 VERONIA. most tiresome and insipid inventions in the world ; domestic bliss, I confess, I am doubt ful of \u2014 perhaps because I have never met with it \u2014 and, to reasonable men, Monsieur le Marquis, like you and me, there cannot be a doubt what form of existence is the most tolerable one. You have hit upon it. I make you my compliment.\" At this moment, to Van Helder's regret, the sound of an opening door and ap proaching footsteps bespoke fresh arrivals ; the servant at the same instant announced the Count de Briedieu and Sir Douglas Douglas of Dragonhall, and the two gentle men, already known to the reader, appeared as St. Gregoire rose to receive them. The Baronet glanced curiously at Van Helder, while on his part, the Doctor recog nized in the handsome Briton Carl Dop ter's patron. An almost imperceptible glance of intelli gence passed between Sir Douglas and his host, as the party seated themselves. To a very quick observer it would have betrayed the fact that Van Helder and his peculiari ties had formed the subject of former con versation between them, and that this meet ing was not altogether an accidental one."], [85, "VERONIA. 79 \"The Baronet and myself were on our way to , but a sudden inspiration brought us hither,\" said the Count, address ing himself to St. Gregoire, and coining the polite fie with a little more animation than was usual to him. \" An inspiration, my dear Count, for which we are duly grateful,\" said the Mar quis, with that mixture of high-bred cour tesy and serene indifference which contrasted strongly with the simplicity of his manner towards Van Helder. \" Monsieur le Docteur Van Helder \" \u2014 bowing to him \u2014 \" and my self were decided on an evening a, V original; perhaps you will join us in the same in tention ?\" The Count smiled and bowed; the Baronet spoke. \" Monsieur de Briedieu very evi dently consents ; and, for myself, there is nothing I delight in so much as novelty. What do you propose, Monsieur le Mar quis i \" Monsieur Van Helder and I had just started a theme. May we pursue it ?\" \" With the greatest pleasure ; conversa tion is the most rational amusement, after all, and that of which one becomes the least satiated.

Why, I retired from the contest, because I recognized that in such an encounter I must inevitably get considerably the worst of it. I felt myself to be, in fact, circumstanced like that very discriminating person who, on being asked why he was locked up, answered \u2014 ' The world said I was mad, and I said the world was mad ; but the world was the strongest, and carried the day.'\" \"Ha, ha!\" laughed the Scotchman, you are candid, Meinheer \u2014 very !\" \"To be sure \u2014 and why not?\" replied the Doctor, complacently. \"The man who blushes for his opinions is a fool, and he VOL.

Don't you see that the others would immediately enact the part of the jackdaw in the fable \u2014 fall upon and pluck her to pieces, as a natural consequence ? \" \" I have been given to understand, Sir Douglas, that there is a code of honour among nations, as among men, but I may have been misinformed,\" argued Van Helder, gravely."], [92, "86 VERONIA. \" I have heard so, too,\" answered the amused Scotchman ; \" but whether it would not succumb to such a temptation, I very greatly doubt, so that I am inclined to think reforms must begin in some other quarter, and we must be content, under the present conditions of the human mind, to submit to existing abuses in the shape of armies and navies, and the expenses they undoubtedly entail ; but what other improvements in the social scheme, Doctor Van Helder, have you to suggest ? \" \" It would be more correct, Sir Douglas, to ask what improvements I do not find to suggest, for the number of abuses in every nation, I think, is legion ; but, as we are on the subject of your own country, do you know what to that same country is the cost of policemen, prisons, &c, and all those little exigencies of the criminal population ? Well, something not far from the annual trifle of 9,000,000/. ! Do you know that one half of the unhappy wretches have not yet reached the age of man or womanhood, and that the sums expended on charities, re formatories, schools, refuges, &c, immense as these are, are yet as drops of water, com pared to the moral and physical destitution"], [93, "87 VERONIA. abroad?

The oldest story on record contains such an incident \u2014 you believe, I suppose, in the history of Adam and Eve ? \" Van Helder looked at the supposed fol lower of John Knox, with a naive surprise at the levity of the question, which ap peared in his features, and added to the questioner's amusement as the Doctor replied seriously \u2014"], [96, "90 VERONIA. \"Six thousand years, Sir Douglas, is rather too remote a date to look back to with any precision: the circumstance mayor may not have occurred, I don't for one moment pre tend to decide the question; all I can presume to dispute on now is your argument, that a necessity for misdeeds really exists. It is no such thing, sir \u2014 there ought not to be the slightest necessity for people going wrong at all, if things were properly managed; as it is, however, and under existing institutions, I confess, I don't see how they are often to go right.\" \" My dear Doctor Van Helder,'' ex claimed his companion, triumphantly, at this point, \" will you excuse my saying that I think you must be what 1 have heard called a philosophic radical \u2014 an out and out reformer ; why, then, may I inquire, without rudeness, do you, as I am told, disclaim even the name of ' liberal ' alto gether ? \" Van Helder laughed again bitterly. \" Simply, sir,\" said he, sarcastically, \" because that term, as at present applied, does not in the slightest degree represent liberality, as I understand it. You know the writings of your splendid Thackeray, I"], [97, "91 VERONIA. make no doubt ; well, that accomplished writer's pen \u2014 spurred, perhaps, by the delirious pangs of an overpowering remorse for some of its misdeeds \u2014 occasionally melts into an indulgent rhapsody, which com pletely carries it away. It did so when it wrote the phrase, ' Every whig is not illiberal, or every radical an aristocrat at heart.' Charity is necessary, sir, no doubt, but that is really a little too much of it ! \" \" Ah ! you think so,\" said the still more amused Baronet ; \" I am no politician, and generally take for granted what I hear.\" \" I know it, sir, I know it ! we all learn these things in the nursery, as we do the stories of ' Puss in Boots,' ' Little Red Riding-Hood ' \u2014 and ' Bluebeard,' I was going incorrectly to say, for that has its foundation in truth \u2014 but I rather fancy that few of us remain believers in them very long. Once I was simple enough to think every self-styled liberal a philan thropist, and as a boy was proud of the name \u2014 talked as loudly as the rest about the tide of progress, the rights of the people, &c, until one day I found out my mistake. The progress I meant was rescue"], [98, "92 VERONIA. and happiness for the agricultural labourer, the miner, the factory girl, the city artisan, the millions of unhappy creatures who, in dead winter, wake at daybreak shuddering, not so much at the terrors of their own grim destiny as at the necessity of meeting again the dreadful image of want and suf fering in the faces of those they love. AVhat these same liberals meant was nothing of the kind. The pauper was to rest satis fied with his workhouse, the labourer with his squalid hut, the artisan with his cellar. The pauper ! great God ! does not that hideous word resume in itself the crying in famy of present social systems? Does it not represent one whose existence \u2014 a very burden to himself \u2014 is reproached to him by all ? Alas ! for those who, still retaining any traces of the dignity of human nature, fall into this abyss of woe. \"Their names\" \u2014 saj^s a writer of your own nation \u2014 \" are erased from the book of men ; by accepting the enforced charity of their fellow-creatures, they are bound hand and foot to their degraded condition, and the few remaining links of sympathy exist ing between the comparatively rich and poor, are destroyed at one blow. A poor"], [99, "93 VERONIA. man, to use his own expressive words, ' never holds up his head in the world again.' Who, then, with the feelings of humanity, can urge to the poor this last and crushing resource ?\" We see, indeed, and every day brings fresh examples of it, how they prefer to die rather, frozen, starved, and despairing, in the ghastly desolation of their own soli tudes, than consent, half maddened by the ferocious tooth of famine, to be fed like do^s at yards and soup-kitchens in seasons of distress. But what matters this, so long as the interests of the prosperous classes are progressing favourably ; that these latter are rising in the social scale, and growing into ladies and gentlemen, at least.\" \" Ladies and gentlemen !\" echoed the listener, lazily, \"that very same idea has often struck me ; I often wonder what has become of all the men and women, now-a days, there don't seem to be any left. I find that my sister's milliner has become a lady, and my bootmaker is undeniably a gentleman ; my coal-merchant has, I under stand, been one this century. I can be no more myself, so I give it up, and think seriously of taking, as a distinction, the title of citizen \u2014 the well-born classes will inevit-"], [100, "94 VERONIA. ably have to take that course some day.\" \" I think it very probable,\" answered Van Helder; \"but when they do, the gentle men and ladies will become citizens also, you will find. The fact is, I must confess, Sir Douglas, that the born gentleman \u2014 foolish as are even some of his pretensions \u2014 is yet a vastly more logical creature than is the plebeian. The latter, while laughing at the claims of birth, insists upon being himself a gentleman. Now are these ideas reconcileable ? Why can't he stand upon his merits as a man, or, if he esteems gen tility, why does he mock at gentle blood ?\" \" Just so,\" laughed Sir Douglas, enchanted at the philosophy of the observation, \" and I fancy, Doctor Van Helder, that it would rather puzzle these same gentry to explain their views upon the subject with anything like clearness or precision. If it did not furnish materials for a great deal of amuse ment to us, nothing would be so insufferable as that horrid class which will insist on being genteel, and its encroachments are becom ing more frightful every day.\" \" Amusement, however, in large quanti ties may be drawn by the quiet observer from some of its freaks,\" said Van Helder."], [101, "95 VERONIA. \" Nothing made me laugh oftener, when I was in England, than the wonderful appli cations so frequently made of that same title gentleman. I heard so often the ob servation made by one man of another \u2014 ' Oh ! he's no gentleman !' and I used to wonder who ever supposed he was. It would have charmed the\" shade of Moliere.\" \"And yet,\" reflectively argued the Baronet, \" I am inclined to think, from the universality of this wish for distinction, this aspiration to rise above his fellows, which seems implanted like an instinct in the mind of man, that there must exist some philoso phic explanation of it \u2014 it doubtless was bestowed by nature for some good reason.\" \" Certainly,\" replied Van Helder, \" I am of your opinion. Phocions are so rare that it is evident they belong only to the very highest developments of humanity ; but, while recognizing the right of every human being to rise above his fellows if he can, for Heaven's sake let us not accept also the diabolic selfishness which prompts forgetful ness of others. Let all these excellent ple beians aspire to and reach the goal patri cian, if they will, only let them not ride over the claims of others less fortunate than they.\""], [102, "96 VERONIA. \" There is, indeed, a mass of misery in Great Britain,\" remarked the young Baronet, more seriously than he had spoken yet. \" I have often wondered, in passing through the Canongate, in Edinburgh alone, how it was that the whole of its inhabitants were not swept off, regularly and systematically, to the gallows every week or so, so villainous are the countenances, so depraved the aspect of almost every creature you see there.\" \" The gallows ! Ay, there again ! what foul blots upon all legislation are the scenes to which its exhibition gives birth!\" ex claimed Van Helder. \"Merciful Heaven! shall I ever forget one such I witnessed in England years ago?\" \" Indeed,\" asked thelistener, inquisitively, \"were you really ever present at a hanging? I should like to hear all about it, for I have never seen one myself \u2014 the idea disgusted me, I confess.\" \" Sir,\" answered Van Helder, with his most solemn air, \" the more terrible is a thing, the more repulsive to our sense of right, the more painful to contemplate, the less for all those reasons \u2014 if it enters into the institutions of our country \u2014 ought we to shrink from formingonitthe judgment which"], [103, "97 VERONIA. canalonecome from experience. These things are managed rather differently here and in my own country. I had seen how, in the lat ter, and come to a conclusion, but I wanted to see how they were conducted in yours ; the occasion there offers itself frequently, as you perhaps know, and I profited by it.\" \" Frequently, indeed,\" sighed the Briton ; \" but, my dear Doctor, tell me all about it \u2014 I should like to know exactly the effect such a spectacle would produce upon a foreigner. You have no objection to such a detail, gentlemen,\" he inquired, turning to the two attentive listeners ; and on receiving their reply, Van Helder commenced : \" I was one of those who witnessed the execution of the* infamous . It was the first time I had ever been present at a similar spectacle in England, and I will briefly say that my motive for attending so terrible a scene, was not the inexcusable one of mere curiosity, but the strong and earnest wish to form a fair and accurate judgment on the utility of a public exhibition of the punishment of death. I had read and lis tened to arguments without number in fa vour of its abolition, but these, and even the perusal of the harrowing Dernier Jour d'un VOL. III. H"], [104, "98 VERONIA. Condamne, had all left me unconvinced. It had always seemed to me a just decree that the murderer should die in expiation of his crime, and an expedient and wholesome thing that the example offered by his punishment should be made public. This conviction I carried with me to the scene in question. \" It was seven o'clock \u2014 a dim November morning \u2014 when I reached Newgate Street, on arriving at the corner of which, a spectacle met my sight, which I should have difficulty in describing. The persons present were, as I have since learnt, estimated at above twenty thousand in number, and I can quite believe it, for far, far beyond the spot whence any view of the gallows could be obtained, the crowd was densely packed, as far as the eye could reach. All progress, in the direc tion of the gallows, was simply impossible, so I pushed onwards to the other corner of the street, and got shoved along in the di rection of St. Sepulchre's, under whose iron railing I, at length, managed, by firmly holding a lamp-post, to come to a stand. Thence, dimly looming through the fog, ap peared the dismal engine of death. \" It was then twenty minutes to eight o'clock, and amid a torrent of hideous ob-"], [105, "VERONIA. 99 scenity, curses, and laughter, I caught the expression of repeated wishes for the strik ing of the hour \u2014 the signal for the criminal's appearance. \" ' What's he doing now, I wonder ? ' 'Listening to the priest's palaver, to be sure.' 'I say, now, ain't he sorry as how he did it?' 'Oh that ain't nothing to his other doings ;' and so on. Not a word of compassion for the miserable man whose last moments were passing all too slowly for those now waiting to view his death agonies ! \" Every moment the masses thickened, until, at the irruption of each new body of arrivals, they bent and swayed like a heav ing wave. A decent-looking young woman near me began to show symptoms of faint ing, and piteously implored those around her her 'not to press her to death,' to which the answer was, 'that she must take her chance with the rest.' Another woman be gan at this moment beating her way out, be ing on the verge of suffocation, as testified by her blackened face, starting eyes, and frantic gestures, but no one seemed to care whether she died then and there, or not. Looking- round, I saw that the former one had fainted, but was fortunately prevented, H 2"], [106, "100 VERONIA. by the pressure of those around her, from falling, as, had she done so, life would have been mercilessly trampled out of her on the spot. Some policemen and others were coolly looking on, excepting one brave fel low, who, exclaiming at the brutality of treating a female so,' induced some one to thump her into consciousness again, and then, bidding her seize his collar, began to fight a way out for her, calling loudly on all to give way. The poor creature struggled hard to follow, clinging desperately to him by one hand ; but at that instant the fatal hour began to strike, the bell to toll. A yell of fierce excitement burst from the crowd, and again it swayed and heaved, as another terrific mob came pouring down upon it from Smithfield. \" I saw the girl torn apart from her pro tector, and struggling, desperate with terror, in the face of the foul, drunken, hideous wretches who were rushing furiously on. \"The shrieks of women, curses, cries of exultation at sight of the swinging corpse before them, all united to form a scene of hor ror such as all language would fail to paint. \" The fate of the murderer, the grim spec tacle on the scaffold, all paled before the far"], [107, "VERONIA. 101 more appalling one of that ocean of ferocious life and its diabolic joy.\" \" A horrid scene, and one which it must have required nerve indeed to mingle with,\" here said the Count, whose cheek had paled, and whose eyes had dilated at the description. \"Horrid, indeed !\" echoed the Marquis, in his brief, calm tones ; \" but necessary, I suppose, since a governmentcan authorize it.\" \" Exactly where I have the misfortune to differ from you, Monsieur le Marquis; but I never expect to make converts to my opinions, and am resigned to be considered what Sir Douglas has so happily designated as a ' philosophic radical,' \" said Van Helder, with a laugh. Midnight at this instant struck from the neighbouring towers of St. Sulpice ; at the sound Sir Douglas and his companion dis creetly moved, as if to retire. \" Not yet, gentlemen, you are surely not going yet,\" politely said the host. \" Why, to be sure, it is not so late as it might be,\" exclaimed the Doctor, so excited by the events of the evening as to have lost all estimation of time, and springing up like a boy ready for some fresh prank ; \"at all events, if we break up here, Monsieur le"], [108, "102 VERONIA.

Obedience can go no further, it is that of a little child ! \" \" My dear Doctor, to the faithful there can be no medium in all that appertains to the spiritual kingdom. Doubtless such sub mission is not always easy ; flesh and blood sometimes contend against it ; but then, when the voice of fallen nature is raised in revolt, a word whispered by faith suffices to calm the storm. She murmurs softly the promise ' on this rock,' and on that promise we rest.\""], [109, "103 CHAPTER VII. Not many days after this, Van Helder quitted Paris. His restless mind, his active habits, rendered society so great a martyr dom to him, that even for the sake of his really beloved protegee, he could bear the ordeal no longer. Their parting was more pathetic than could have been easily sup posed. He understood how different was this separation from their former one on the threshold of the convent of Septuagesi ma, where every probability had been in favour of her speedy re-appearance, but, in resigning her to this brilliant world, so ___> O ' remote from his own wild sphere, Van Helder felt that she became in a manner lost to him for ever. To Veronia the part ing had been more solemn still, for it was not onlv the staunch and devoted friend to"], [110, "104 VERONIA. whom she bade farewell, but to the last link which connected her with those troubled, and yet cherished days associated in her mind so inseparably with him. Whence arises the mysterious law that makes even the saddest days of the past wear, in the recollection, so soft a halo ? It is a merciful dispensation, at least, which makes the re membrance of joy remain so vivid to the last, and softens off the rough edges of past pain. Bitter, very bitter, as had been most of Veronia's hours in that lonely hut, darkened by her mother's dying agonies, and her own still keener living ones, yet now recurred more often to her memory than these the fresh sea-breeze, the morn ing or the sun-set aspect of that ocean scene, the gentle pressure of her mother's hand, the murmur of Beth's kindly voice, while aiding in some simple household duty, or even a dreamy image of the dim sand-hills melting into the only picturesque appear ance they could ever wear beneath the softening influence of twilight. Chill was the picture, colourless and sad, but the warmth of her own youth had once touched it, and the mellow tint would ever afterwards remain."], [111, "105 VERONIA. Van Helder then departed, and Made moiselle de Mehul remained alone in the world of strangers, which was henceforth to be her home. It might have been supposed that the Duke, kind and excellent as he was, would have drawn at once more closely to him, this late found claimant on his best affections; that he would have openly sympathised with the strangeness of her new position, and sought to make her feel that she was loved; but such \u2014 undoubtedly a little to Veronia's disappointment \u2014 was not the case. Ex quisitely gentle and courteous in his manner to her, as indeed to all else, there yet existed round the Duke an atmosphere of stately self-concentration, which, to a sensitive nature like that of his niece, formed a more impenetrable barrier than any other. The accent of his morning and nightly salu tations, the smile which accompanied them, and the soft kiss unfailingly imprinted on her brow, were those of the most accom plished of courtiers, but this was all. When alone with her he never inquired of the past, what had been fair, or what had been stormy ; above all, the name of his dead sister, the story of her sorrows, remained"], [112, "106 VERONIA. unmentioned, unalluded to by him. Had he loved her, and was it this love that had prompted his adoption of her child, or was it alone the stern sense of duty \u2014 the Christian's duty of restitution. The ques tion was too utterly impenetrable for Veronia's powers of solution, yet to a mind more accomplished in the world's science, it wrould have been an easy one. Tempered by circumstances as had been his character to a softer tone than it would originally have possessed, and subdued also by the inevitable infirmities of age, the old nobleman could scarcely be expected to feel with the same vivacity as herself, the charm to be derived from so unexpected and tender a tie; but he undoubtedly experienced a serene pleasure in her society, and a sort of pride in the noble qualities which she seemed to possess. And perhaps this is, in fact, the ultimatum to which his sex can attain. To love un selfishly without a motive is scarcely in the power of man. Remorse had been the motive power which led to the recognition of Veronia's claim, pride was the element which cemented it. And yet the Duke was the very reverse"], [113, "107 VERONIA. of a worldly character. Deep rather than strong feeling had always characterized him, together with the sort of diffidence which attends it. Wounded by his sister's mar riage, he had broken off abruptly all communication with her, to the extent which we have seen ; but there remained yet links of tenderness, which reverted by right to Veronia, had she been the woman to pro fit by them. But such was not the case. Endowed by nature with a pride stronger, because loftier, than his own, his niece had sought, morally, the lion's part ; the jackal's was unthought of by her. To be indeed the next of blood, the nearest, the dearest, to bring to this faded life a new hope, a new feeling, seemed to her sufficient. That this must have been the object Heaven had in view in presenting it to her, she never doubted. To benefit sordidly by it, to rise through it higher in the social scale, these were vain toys which the heart of Veronia disdained. The brilliant sunshine of a May morning was shining through the painted window of an oratory in which were assembled three persons awaiting the mass, for which a"], [114, "108 VERONIA. priest was already making preparations at an altar richly laden with the choicest flowers of the season. The remaining decora tions of this little sanctuary were chaste and simple. The communion drapery of fine cambric, simply edged with a single row of delicate lace ; the ornaments of the altar corresponding in simplicity, and though handsome, yet plain and severe, made the only indications of luxury \u2014 consisting in the variety and abundance of the floral treasures collected there \u2014 seem more ap parent. On a low prie-dieu covered with dark cushions, placed on the right hand side of the altar, and nearly facing an exquisitely finished marble copy of the Madonna and Infant of Michael Angelo, knelt a person, neither broken nor infirm in aspect, but the lines of whose still fine countenance suffici ently indicated at least a septuagenarian. There was a dignity about the figure, a loftiness in the carriage of the head, which well interpreted the habits and station of the man. It was impossible not to see at a glance, not merely the noble origin, but the noble associations of which his person bore the impress, for birth may, and often does,"], [115, "109 VERONIA. fail to confer a distinguishing mark upon its possessor, but breeding never ; and this fact is, perhaps, the best argument that can be adduced in favour of the native equality of all men. Another prie-dieu just opposite thisfirstone held a lady equally distinguished in person, but over whose features hung the melan choly which belongs to youth when asso ciated with the memory of grief. There had been lines of care in her countenance which had now passed away. Repose, re newed health \u2014 resignation, above all \u2014 had effaced them ; nothing but their subdued reflection remained, and that lent, perhaps, a deeper charm to the pale, calm features,\" because it was in entire keeping with the very character of their beauty. Unshadowed thus the face would have been less beauti ful and far less soft. These two persons were the Duke de Rochefierre and Veronia de Mehul. At the foot of the altar knelt the other person we have mentioned, who, from the place he occupied, had evidently accepted the office of serving the mass. His rather severe features were now lighted up by an expression of devout pleasure, which proved"], [116, "110 VERONIA. how deep a hold the religious sentiment possessed over his mind. The nobleman, the man of science, and of the lofty world in which he held no mean place, were all, at this moment, merged in the humble acolyte. Everything beyond that tranquil altar was forgotten and unheeded in the simplicity of faith, in the contemplation of her absorbing mysteries. Need we say that this man was the Mar quis de St. Gregoire ? The Duke's own chaplain was the priest who stood there, for, by a particular dis pensation, the nobleman enjoyed the rare privilege of having mass celebrated under bis own roof. It was still so early that scarce a murmur from without broke the stillness that reigned there. The only sound within was caused by the slight fluttering of the pages as the priest sought out his readings for the day ; and presently this ceased, to be replaced by the solemn murmur of the celebration, the responses, and the occasional silver tinkle of the little bell. Oh ! fair, serene, unearthly moments, when all that is sad and human stands back subdued and softened, to give place to the"], [117, "VERONIA. 111 divine ! None but the Catholic can know how half the joys of Heaven come softly down to earth in solemn hours like these ; none but he can lave his spirit in those eternal waters, and see with the eyes of faith the glorious, the Immortal One upon the altar, because none but he believes, with a child's simplicity, the promise that truly that presence shall be there. So felt, so believed the prayerful trio who knelt around that shrine; and so believ ing, that peace which passeth understanding swept all meaner interests from their souls. More softly, calmly, happily than it had beat for many a long day, Veronia's heart was beating now ; the holy peacefulness of the hour was mirrored in her breast. Fled were the dark agonies of the past \u2014 the shame of worldly dishonour, the humiliations of her poverty, the tortures of that idola trous love \u2014 all had vanished like a dream. Oh ! solitude, solitude, so often decried ! Oh, lonely hours, whose moments seemed each as they lingered like emblems of a sad eternity ! How many have come to bless, to thank, to venerate your solemn memory ! For every pang that you enhanced, your pale hands gave, at last, a hope, a strength,"], [118, "112 VERONIA. a grace, the world can neither give nor take away. The day had come when thus felt Vero nia ; it had come slowly, agonizingly, but it had come at length, and with it had come peace. When the links of a dread chain hadfallen crumblingly of themselves \u2014 when the darkness of passion had passed away, and a happy liberty had taken their place \u2014 then could the victim look back and rejoice. She could stoop humbly and thankfully to lift the pearls that had been scattered before so worthless an idol, and feel that, sullied as had been their surface, the stain had vanished thence and left it pure. Who has not wasted treasure on some futile dream ? Who has not worshipped ignorantly at some empty shrine ? Happy, too happy, they to whom the shame of such a memory has taught the lesson to conse crate their hearts and treasures to a nobler purpose in the future ! And, gathered thus herself so blissfully within the fold, Veronia thought of those still wandering and forlorn, the two associates of her latest days of sorrow \u2014 Van Helder and Jacques Henricart \u2014 and their names came to her lips in prayer. Would the wild"], [119, "113 VERONIA. but generous Doctor ever awaken from his dreams of social regeneration to the reality of a spiritual one, or Henricart forget his blood-red visions in the future ? All human probabilities seemed against such a change in either, and yet, was it a fancy, or had she herself wrought some revolution in the latter's heart? That he had loved her she was almost certain ; that he must have suffered deeply and keenly by that love, she knew by her own experi ence ; yet that he had had the courage to be silent, bearing that suffering \u2014 if it existed \u2014 with the dignity of a noble pride, remembering the distance society had marked between them, and bowing to a fiat whose justice he still disclaimed \u2014 this, all this, Veronia had long known; and now, as these memories came back upon her, asso ciated as his image was ever wont to be with that harrowing moment beside her mother's grave, what wonder that a tender pity thrilled her breast ? Could the old Duke have read these thoughts what would have been his im pression ? Pride, family pride, had been his weakness through life; was it destined to be cruelly wounded ? VOL III. I"], [120, "114 VERONIA. The mass had been concluded some minutes, during which the priest had been occupied with his thanksgiving, and his acolyte in preparing for the moment when his services would be required in another quarter. The Duke rose, and St. Gregoire hastened to his side. The old nobleman took his proffered arm, and their footsteps were directed to the door of the chapel. Veronia joined them, and then the household, who had respectfully awaited the signal, followed. \" Monsieur de Boisvante has not yet risen, then ? \" inquired the master of the establishment, in a whisper, of his house steward, as the latter threw open the doors of the breakfast-room at the approach of the party. \" No, my lord ; monsieur has only this instant rung ; his valet has gone to him,\" was the reply. This absence of his nephew from the morning devotions was so frequent as to be almost habitual. The Duke sighed, but made no observa tion upon it."], [121, "115 CHAPTER VIII. Time stole on. Veronia had been nearly three months an inmate of her uncle's household, and with the elasticity of youth was beginning to adapt herself to the new world now opened to her, as if she had scarcely known any other. To say that she was happy would be an exaggeration, for her past trials had left their traces in a susceptibility to even the most passing subjects of anxiety, which at times inevitably produced a state of melan choly, against which she struggled vainly ; but these impressions grew daily weaker and less frequent, and she was gradually re awakening to the compensations as well as to the vexations of society. Among the former ranked first of all the tranquil pleasure which she experienced in the consciousness of her uncle's regard ; i2"], [122, "116 VERONIA. although it was of an undemonstrative kind, yet she felt assured of its reality. His kind and gentle manner indeed had not warmed to more fervid tenderness, but he asked for her presence oftener, seemed grieved when a passing shadow rested on her brow, in all substantial matters was splendid in his gene rosity, and repaying all this with her affec tion, Veronia was not left quite comfortless. There were few indeed of the persons who frequented the Duke's drawing-rooms who inspired her with deep interest, but several whose conversation pleased and at tracted her, and of this number were both the Marquis de St. Gregoire and the poet Count. The first flattering impression of Madame de Mont Brison had been evanes cent. The fair widow's talents, it is true, would have perfectly sufficed to sustain the character she had first wished to represent, but jealousy had made her sometimes drop the mask, and soon, to Veronia's grief and astonishment, she discerned the foe thus dressed in smiles. Chilled and repulsed by this one example of deceit, she sought no other companions of her own sex, and remained thus almost solitary in heart amid the throng."], [123, "VERONIA 117 And how did she accept the new position forced upon her, with respect to Adrian de Boisvante? With the calm dignity of one whose illusions are dispelled ; while he, em barrassed, angry at her reserve, and chafing inwardly beneath the disdain which he imagined in her glances when they met, with the contradiction of his sex, now felt the love \u2014 such as it was \u2014 which he had formerly entertained for her, rekindling in his breast. St. Gregoire's avowed interest in her, De Briedieu's evident homage, the admiration of so many others, whose fashionable insen sibility was seldom known to yield to enthu tiasm beneath the charm of beauty or any other, all these stirred in De Boisvante's mind a new emotion of regret for that which he had lost, a desperate wish to regain it, and the resolve that he would win once more Veronia's now chilled heart. His cousin's avoidance of him, the severe coldness which she maintained, even beneath the veil of graciousness which she was com pelled by her position to assume towards him, Herminie's keen watchfulness, and evi dent suspicion of the state of his feelings, these were difficulties hard to be overcome."], [124, "118 VERONIA. He lived on, however, in the hope of yet succeeding, while the object of this hope, secure in her own indifference, dreamt not of the plot thus fermenting against her peace. It was not merely that she no longer loved De Boisvante, but that she had ar rived at the point of judging him dispassion ately, and appreciating, to its very depths the thorough baseness and unredeemed cowardice of his character. And so the machinations of mean er minds worked on around her unobserved. \" Do you observe,\" said Madame de Mont Brison, one day, rather despondingly, to Madame de St. Bartelemy, \" that Mademoi selle de Mehul persists in still wearing the very deepest mourning, and that her influ ence with the Duke seems to increase? Poor Adrian, I fear his prospects will suffer by it, and I think he is of the same opinion himself, he looks so depressed lately.\" \" My dear,\" said Madame de St. Barte lemy, to whom this remark had been ad dressed, \" if the worst come to the worst, he must marry her, that is all.', \"Marry her!\" ejaculated the widow, taken by surprise ; \" my dear friend, what are you thinking of? \""], [125, "VERONIA. 119 \"I am thinking of his interests, Herminie ; what can he do better ? \" Madame de Mont Brison was occupied at this moment on a piece of embroidery. She rose, laid it carefully aside, and, drawing her chair nearer to Madame de St. Barte lemy, replied : \" Adrian has debts.\" \" The very reason, my dear, why he should seek a wife who can pay them ; and, at the rate that Mademoiselle de Mctiul is pro gressing in your uncle's good graces, she is a very likely person to be able to do so.\" Madame de Mont Brison's fair cheek deepened in colour ; she bit her lip for a mo ment silently \u2014 then said, \" Are you the person to counsel this ? \" \" What would you have, my dear Her minie? Adrian is in debt, his position is desperate \u2014 we cannot help him \u2014 let those do so who can.\" \"And yet you thought her an intrigante\" exclaimed Madame de Mont Brison, anger getting the better of prudence in her mind ; \" rather, say I, let us crush the viper, for she is nothing else ! \" \" Yes, my dear child, so long as it is pos sible to crush vipers, let us crush them ;"], [126, "120 VERONIA. when they get beyond that point, let us accept them, say I. Your cousin is a wo man of talent ; I doubt that it will be very difficult to circumvent her.\" \" But,\" exclaimed Herminie, imperiously, \" shall we retreat baffled before a creature of whose existence, six months since, the Duke himself was ignorant ? Shall we look on resignedly, and see his fortune, his affec tions, disposed of thus, in favour of a girl whose very antecedents are unknown to us ? The thought is intolerable; for Adrian's sake, for the Duke's even, something must be done. You are the person, my dear ma dame, as a friend of the family, to suggest some remedy for the evil which threatens it.\" \" Unless some misbehaviour could be proved against this young person in the past \u2014 some indiscretion which would reflect dis grace upon those brought in contact with her,\" replied Madame de St. Bartelemy, \" I see nothing, my dear friend, but to make the best of the connection. I thought, I do think still, that the ease with which she has glided into the Duke's good graces is quite insufferable ; but since every prudent means of weakening her influence, which we have"], [127, "121 VERONIA. tried, has failed, the only thing left is to make the best of a bad business.\" \" Never ! \" emphatically exclaimed the angry Herminie, \" it is not to be borne ! Do you know that she has actually fasci nated the Marquis de St. Gregoire \u2014 that ice berg, whom all the world thought so impe netrable ! After that, my dear friend, what are we to expect ? \" \" I rather fancy, too, that she has views upon the young Prince de Possowitz ; at least, she retained him by her side longer than was at all proper, last evening. I saw that Monsieur de St. Gregoire also re marked it, and I think that it annoyed him.\" \"Ah!\" said Madame de Mont Brison, with a gleam of satisfaction in her eyes, \" from this quarter, then, may come a solu tion of our difficulty ; let her once play the coquette, and the game is in our hands ; the Duke would never overlook a breach of con venance like that ; and, after all, unaccus tomed, as she probably is, to the austere eti quette which our world imposes on unmar ried women, nothing is more likely than that she will end by committing some unforgive able breach of it ; I breathe again \u2014 there is hope.\""], [128, "122 VERONIA. \" Decidedly,\" laughed the elder lady ; \"opportunities too will not be wanting later at my chateau, should she accompany us thither; it would never do to leave the Duke alone in her hands while his nephew and yourself are absent ; his last will and testament would be completed on your return without a doubt.\" \"Assuredly. And if you are kind enough, my dear friend, to be troubled with her, all will be well ; for my uncle asked me, no later than yesterday, if she was included in your invitation \u2014 he thinks that she requires country air.\" \" Which, for your sweet sake, she shall taste at Majestura ; who knows but that the English baronet may be tempted to cut the knot by carrying her off into his misty country ? That would be a favourable denouement enough \u2014 an elopement, for instance, in the Britannic style \u2014 the Duke would never recover it ! \" \" No, poor old man, such a scandal would certainly kill him at once ; but I think the question might be solved less despe rately. In fact, my dear friend, entre nous, Adrian holds in his hand a clue which may any day be turned to account ; but I think"], [129, "123 VERONIA. that perhaps the results might be obtained by slighter means. An indiscretion, a breach of etiquette, a violation of his own exalted ideas of delicacy, would equally suffice thoroughly to disgust her uncle and to ruin her in the estimation of our circle. Then poor Adrian would resume his undiminished rights, and she would of course return into her convent, probably take the veil, and have a much better chance of saving her soul than if she remained among us. These considerations, my dear friend, must con vince you that I am trying to enlist you in a good work, do you perceive ? \" \" Perfectly, little diplomatist,\" answered the devout lady, as she tapped the speaker's round arm laughingly with her fan. \" But fear not,\" added she, modulating her tone so as to suit the sentiment she expressed ; \" to guard from violation the interests of a noble family like yours is truly a sort of religious work.\" And so Veronia's fate was balanced, weighed by an upstart devout against the interests of a roue\\ and counted by a jealous rival as the fitting object of a game of woman's wicked calculation. But while these machinations were"], [130, "124 VERONIA. pending Veronia had become the subject of very different speculations in another quarter. Although veiled by all the arti ficial coldness of an accomplished member of society, the Marquis's secret had yet not escaped the keen eyes of Madame de Mont Brison, and, as she had hinted in the late conversation, he had begun to feel a more than common interest in Mademoi selle de Mehul. Unimpressionable by tem perament, and enthusiastic only when his intellect was awakened, he had passed the middle age of man without ever having experienced a serious passion. But, in j ustice to him be it said, this had perhaps arisen rather from the inadequacy of the women among whom he had mingled to inspire such, than from his own incapacity to enter tain it. Not that in the distinguished circle which he frequented women of exquisite refinement of both person and manner were rare, but that, as Herminie had said, the excessive austerity of manner imposed on its unmarried members was such as to form an effectual barrier between them and any individual attentions from the other sex ; while from anything beyond the most distant and superficial communi-"], [131, "VERONIA. 125 cation with the married portion of society, the Marquis's severity of principles equally deterred him. His feeling for Mademoiselle de Meliul was exactly the sort of sentiment which might have been expected from him \u2014 calm, dignified, dispassionate, and yet profound like himself. Notwithstanding his expressed admiration of her person on the occasion of her first appearance in the Duke's drawing-room, her beauty ' alone had but slightly inspired it. It was rather the nobility of the mind which it reflected, and those more intellectual charms calcu lated to captivate a man of taste \u2014 the assurance, above all, that in winning her for his bride he should thus enhance the dignity of his name and rank, and find a fitting partner for both. Under the influence of thoughts like these, St. Gregoire determined to ask in marriage the hand of Mademoiselle de Mehul. Yet even after this determination had been formed his natural reserve made him hesitate. He could not even faintly surmise how his suit was likely to prosper ; and although he knew that, in accordance with the ideas of his countrymen in similar cases, the heartfelt approval of the intended"], [132, "126 VERONIA. bride was held as the least essential point of consideration, yet he had too proud and delicate a mind, he was too thoroughly a gentleman, not to dissent most entirely from so ignoble a theory."], [133, "127 CHAPTER IX. In the neighbourhood of Vendome is to be found a landscape celebrated no less for its smiling grace than for a picturesque feature which attracts to the spot so many pilgrims. This is the chateau of Rochambeau. To antiquarians we leave all details relating to the latter, being ourselves concerned only with the valley which sweeps away past the hill on whose brow hangs suspended the ruin, for in that valley stood the chateau of Madame de St. Bartelemy. At the foot of her gardens \u2014 which, in keeping with the chateau, were fine and spacious \u2014 wound the sparkling river which gives its chief brightness to the scene, and far away behind that to the horizon stretched a view whose extent and verdant beauty must ever dwell upon the memory of those who have once beheld it."], [134, "128 VERONIA. The chateau was a modern building of imposing aspect, in purchasing which its owner for once had sacrificed her aristocratic tendencies to comfort and common sense. A damp, half-ruinous relic of earlier times, half buried in its own ancestral trees, would doubtless have carried with it greater prestige, and she had dwelt some time in imagination on such a choice, but a warning of rheumatism, which had come upon her during the winter while it was pending, had settled the question, and made her decide in favour of Majestura. The month of June was generally the period at which Madame de St. Bartelemy adjourned to this retreat ; but the year had been wet and the summer backward, and at the period when we find her now esta blished there with the ladies De Mont Brison and De Mehul it was already late in July. Monsieur de Boisvante\" had accompanied his cousins, the Marquis de St. Gregoire had quickly followed them, Sir Douglas had arrived that evening, and the Count de Briedieu was expected shortly after termi nating a visit to his own family in the south. In accordance with the exigencies of"], [135, "129 VERONIA. country life the late hours of Paris had been discarded, and the six o'clock dinner now adopted did not thus interfere with the enjoyment of the evening out of doors, where it was most often spent, and on this occasion the party had just assembled on a terrace facing the mansion, and running parallel to the river \u2014 though at some distance from it \u2014 for the purpose of taking coffee. The evening was beautiful; the west melting gradually from its gorgeous crimson into the softness of the brief twilight of that climate ; the airy foliage unstirred by a breath of air, the water gliding peacefully away, all combined to form a fair and tranquil picture which was full of charm. The voices of the party, and their gay but softened laughter, were in pleasant unison with the scene, not the least charming features of which were the graceful forms of the young ladies present. Madame de Mont Brison wore a white robe of exquisitely simple arrangement ; her soft brown hair was ornamented only by a single spray of the pink acacia, and a similar one decorated the bodice of her dress. There was about her person the in describable and feline grace of the Parisian, vol. III. K"], [136, "130 VERONIA. in her countenance its mobile and subtle charm. No one could have contemplated her without a sense of vivid admiration and delight ; the sort of pleasure caused by the beauty of the peach or the moss rose ; but a higher taste would have turned in preference to the more spiritual attractions of Veronia, which the Count had already aptly compared to those of a noble lily on its stem. Although Mademoiselle de Mehul's dress was still a mourning one, the skill of a Parisian artiste had contrived to lend to it all the charming lightness of even Madame de Mont Brison's airy toilette, so that the former was at no disadvantage in this re spect, more particularly as black so well suited her style of beauty. In vain had Madame de Mont Brison insinuated that her cousin's determined adhesion to a mourn ing which was superfluous \u2014 inasmuch as no one knew in the least the date of her loss \u2014 was occasioned purely by her per suasion of its becomingness, and that, in fact, it would be more decorous to lay it aside than intrude it into a society where it offered so marked a contrast. Veronia held her own way, with the gentle and"], [137, "131 VERONIA. silent firmness which might have been expected of her, accepting with perfect serenity the imputation of coquetry, in a manner as surprising as it was provoking to her persecutors. On this evening a crown of her own rich hair alone formed her head-dress, with the exception of a knot of plain black velvet intermingled in it. Her dress, entirely without ornament, fell in the softest folds around her person, giving to the outline a sort of diaphanous indistinctness which, as its artiste had intended, admirably aided its effect. Unlike Madame de Mont Brison, whose brightness was permanent, though her expression was changeful enough, Veronia's countenance varied at each instant, her colour rose and fell with every emotion, almost with every word, showing the finer organization with which she was gifted. The lady of the house had not seen fit, even in this sylvan retreat, to bate an iota of her usual decorations. Ruby and ame thyst, turquoise and diamond, rivalled each other upon her substantial hands, while a splendid peach-coloured silk, profusely trimmed with the richest lace, composed her toilet. In unison with all this embellish- k2"], [138, "132 VERONIA. ment, her mien was resplendent with satis faction, arising from the consciousness of that importance which the owner of Majestura must possess in the eyes of all her guests. It was difficult to look round at the group now surrounding her, bearing, as it did, the impress of such different taste, to say the least, and not wonder how such a combina tion of elements had been effected ; how, in a word, this heavy, pretentious woman, of vulgar mind, if not of vulgar manners, thus found herself the centre of a society so re fined. It was almost surprising, and to a novice would have been wonderful \u2014 yet so it was, and the solution of the problem would have been found to lie in one single word ; that word was \u2014 money ! The world of wretchedness, to whom this word represents not merely comfort, respectability, and hap piness, but life itself, believes, in its simpli city, that as the scale of society ascends, and the need of this article grows less imperious, its influence probably becomes less transcen dent ; the peddling, vulgar class thinks much the same of the class above it, which, in its turn, is dupe of the same opinion con cerning the great world. But is this world exempt from the weak-"], [139, "133 VERONIA. ness, or less ready to yield to it ? Assuredly the success of many a Madame de St. Bar telemy is sufficient answer. On the right hand side of this lady sat two others \u2014 visitors, who had arrived on the previous day, and were to leave on the following one. They were the wife and daughter of the Prefect of a neighbouring town. This gentleman \u2014 Monsieur Alphonse Le Noir \u2014 had been elected to his present post shortly after the coup-d'etdt of Louis Napoleon. He was a person of decent family, good education, and supple princi ples, determined, under all and any circum stances, to make his way, and, as he had ex cellent abilities and very conciliating man ners, would have achieved a good share of popularity, but for the overwhelming pre tensions of his wife and daughter, who could not be brought to entertain the idea of any more important persons than themselves existing in creation. Mademoiselle Le Noir, as being the most attractive of the two, deserves the first mention. Without being pretty, it would have been difficult to be a more charming person. Her complexion, fair and transparent, the profu-"], [140, "134 VERONIA. sion of her literally golden hair, her large, blue, dreamy eyes and pearly teeth, the perfect elegance of her shape, and the grace of every movement, combined to render her an object of universal admiration ; yet she was too sylphlike and fragile to have any real claims to actual beauty. Of her talents, it might be said that they were absolutely comprised in the art of making the tour of her mother's drawing-room with distinction, and saying the right thing at the right time to everyone in it. Beyond the exercise of wit which such an occasion might call forth, her conversation was null; but when she felt it impossible to get further in words, she had always sufficient intelligence to fall back upon the resource with which Heaven had furnished her, the display of what was un deniably the most beautiful set of teeth in the entire prefecture. Madame Le Noir was, in person, the faded likeness of her daughter, and scarcely more elevated in mind, though considerably more vivacious in manner, being what is vulgarly termed \" fussy.\" The object of the visit of these two ladies had been to bring invita tions to the chateau for an approaching ball, which they proposed giving in honour"], [141, "135 VERONIA. of Madame de St. Bartelemy's return to their neighbourhood. The party were at the moment we are describing in the full tide of gaiety, which had been not a little augmented by the arrival of Sir Douglas, who thoroughly belied the popular impression of his country men's coldness and taciturnity. Inspired by the beauty of the scene, the agreeableness of the circle, and perhaps some softer feeling, M. de St. Gregoire was also this evening more animated and smiling than usual, and Adrian de Boisvante, freed from the anxieties which haunted him in Paris, excited by hopes which we have glanced at elsewhere, and yielding to the influence of his mercurial nature, surpassed himself in fascination. Herminie, the young Emilie Le Noir, and even the two elder ladies, were listening with charmed ears to his brilliant flow of language, so true is it that self-complacency in the other sex is the true secret of gaining women's admira tion, and that that man is the most certain of success with them, who, while rendering to their vanity the due amount of homage which it requires, applies to his own indi viduality the axiom that \" man resumes in"], [142, "136 VERONIA. himself the universe,\" which it is not too much to say that every accomplished fop does, as a matter of course. One person present alone listened to De Boisvante indifferently, though his efforts at pleasing were secretly directed to her pre-emi nently \u2014 need we say that this was Veronia ? \" And your promise, Sir Douglas ; you have not forgotten it ? \" said Madame de Mont Brison, turning to the Baronet, during a pause in the conversation ; \" that dear dog; you cannot think how anxious I am to see him.\" \" It was impossible, madame, that I could have forgotten a commission with which you had honoured me,\" was the gallant reply. \" Savage is here, and awaits only your gracious permission to make his appearance ; I can assure you he is quite worthy of his name.\" \" Thanks, Sir Douglas ; you give me much pleasure, and if Madame de St. Bartelemy will kindly allow it, I should like immensely to see him this moment. I only regret that our poor Count is not here to share in the enjoyment of admiring him. \" Do you allow Savage to be presented to us, dear friend ? \""], [143, "137 VERONIA. \" My dear, good Herminie,\" replied the hostess, rather uneasily, \"it is certainly very polite of Sir Douglas to have brought him so far ; but are you in earnest really bent upon accepting so terrible a creature ? Don't you think that, being accustomed to Scotland, he will be unhappy here? \u2014 the climate is so different, you know, it may very likely affect him injuriously, or even drive him mad ;\" and the lady cast an ap pealing glance to the donor of the animal, as if to entreat him to confirm her sugges tion, but, bent on mischief, he only smiled. \" Come, come, my dear cousin,\" inter posed De Boisvante, sarcastically, in answer to the supplicating look now directed by his hostess towards him ; \" considering that the Count, as you say, is not here to participate in your gratification, would it not be kinder to wait until he comes ? Sir Douglas, I dare say, will be of my opinion, seeing that these ladies do not share your enthu siasm on the subject.\" Sir Douglas bowed, and smiled again, but his eyes sparkled under the evident influence of some secretly amusing thought, as Her minie replied, vivaciously : \" A pleasure deferred is no pleasure at"], [144, "138 VERONIA. all, and rest assured that the Count, when he comes, shall enjoy a large share of Savage's society. As to his health, dear Madame de St. Bartelemy, fear not ; Sir Douglas will, I am sure, supply us with all needful information relative to his habits and requirements ; and as to renouncing him, as you suggest, it would be really too cruel a sacrifice ; you will not ask it, I am sure! \" But,\" remonstrated Madame de St. Bartelemy again, \"if in fact he gives way to the dreadful propensities of his race, and perhaps attacks us, unprovoked, all the inmates of the chateau would not suffice to oppose him, my dear, if what I have heard of these bull-dogs is correct. Ah ! Herminie, it makes me shudder ; however, if you will have it so, I can say no more.\" \"A thousand thanks, my dear friend;\" and turning triumphantly to the Baronet, she smilingly repeated her request of being immediately made acquainted with his favourite. With another amused glance Sir Doug las moved away, and in a few moments re appeared, followed by a servant, holding by a thick rope a ferocious specimen of the"], [145, "139 VERONIA. bull-dog race. It was a perfectly white animal, with the usual bullet-head, tremen dous jaw, bandy legs, and an extra allow ance of savage overhanging lip. Its owner seemed intensely to enjoy the shudder with which even Herminie met the small murderous eye which looked up at her, as, taking the cord from the domestic's hand, he led the creature forward for in spection. The Marquis, whose tastes were of the more abstractkind, looked at it with a sort of dis gust; Adrian, too fine a gentleman to affect sympathy with affairs either of the stable or kennel, seemed more inclined to sneer at than admire it, and the group of really frightened ladies pressed closer together as the animal neared them. \"Fear nothing, ladies, I entreat you,\" said the Baronet, encouragingly ; \" while I have him thus, there is, I can assure you, no cause for anxiety. Permit me, madame,\" \u2014 turning to Herminie \u2014 \" to point out to you in what his points consist. See the excessive strength and massiveness of jaw, which would give him a hold impossible to loose ; look, I pray you, at the sullenness of the overhanging lip, and the expression"], [146, "140 VERONIA. of the eye, and, I am sure, you will believe that he is a perfect specimen of thorough, un compromising ferocity. His father's name was Murder \u2014 conferred on him from his countenance \u2014 and Savage has inherited many of his perfections.\" \" That will do, Sir Douglas, if you please,\" faintly remonstrated Madame de St. Barte lemy, now paler than the most vivid imagi nation could ever have supposed her capable of becoming under any circumstances. \" Take him away, pray \u2014 I am sure, Her minie, you have seen enough of him \u2014 and let him be well guarded, Sir Douglas, I entreat you. Oh ! dear, dear ! how can the English cultivate such creatures? \u2014 it is in conceivable ! I am sure I shall dream of him all night.\" \" And I, too,\" ejaculated in turn each of the terrified ladies, while Herminie added : \"I make you my sincere compliments, Sir Douglas ; he is a perfect monster, and I shall not be in the least surprised if, when our poet arrives, he pays to the merits of Savage the homage of fainting at the sight of him. Thank you, thank you, a thousand times !\""], [147, "141 CHAPTER X. The Count's arrival was delayed longer than had been anticipated, and his letters to St. Gregoire, with whom he corresponded, men tioned some circumstances in which he had been engaged as the reason of his protracted absence. Madame de Mont Brison, piqued at the want of eagerness to meet her which this seemed to indicate, internally resolved to punish him severely whenever he should appear, and at length, about three weeks after the party had been established at the chateau, he came. It was an exquisitely balmy, lovely night, the heavens seemed one glittering mass of stars, and the earth bathed in a flood of moon light, which rendered the distant valley as clearly visible as by daylight, even to the romantic ruin which hung suspended from"], [148, "142 VERONIA. its heights. Assembled upon the terrace, Madame de St. Bartelemy 's guests were en gaged in that light and flowing conversation of which jest and repartee form the prin cipal materials, but a little apart from them stood the Marquis and Count engaged in graver discourse. \" This view,\" said the latter, \" recalls to me a singular passage in that most curious psychological study which De Balzac has given us as the life of ' Louis Lambert.' You may remember that to which I allude, as connected with yonder ruin ? \" \" No, indeed ; I am ashamed to say that I have not read the work,\" answered St. Gregoire ; \" what may be the subject of the passage you refer to ? \" \"An incident stated as that which de cided Lambert's scientific career; but I should first mention that the life which is here traced, is that of a youth possessing one of those exquisitely sensitive organiza tions which, perhaps, \u2014 fortunately for hu manity \u2014 are rare, but which serve to reveal the transcendent majesty of some of its still uncomprehended powers. Many of the phenomena related of this mysterious being have been apparent in the cases of Apol-"], [149, "143 VERONIA. lonius, Plotinus, Alphonse Maria de Liguori. and Anthony of Padua, not to mention other well authenticated ones, and I cannot help viewing it as partaking of the same nature as these. The account given by De Balzac is this. While a collegian at Vendome, Louis Lambert, with his com panions, was one day taken by the superiors for an excursion to Rochambeau, whose site he had never visited before. On arriving on the spot, Louis recognized every particular connected with it as having been beheld by him, on the previous night, in his dreams ; his spirit, as he said, had visited and taken note of all, even to the minutest details, while his body lay buried in repose.\" \" A curious story ! \" said the Marquis thoughtfully; \" yet I have met with so many singular things in my time, that I have learnt the lesson of never denying what I cannot understand. Tales of this species of second sight are too widely spread for us to doubt that they must have had some foundation in truth ; but what interpreta tion of the phenomenon does the writer of this story put upon it ? \" \" He quotes the expressed opinion of"], [150, "144 VERONIA. Lambert himself on the subject, which is, that we are gifted with interior faculties which are unaffected by exterior physical laws \u2014 faculties answering in the spiritual being to the functions of the senses in the material one \u2014 a double being, in fact, homo duplex \u2014 capable, under certain conditions of acting independently and apart. How like this is, in fact, to the ancient Egyptian axiom, that 'there are two pairs of eyes in man, and it is requisite that the pair which are beneath should be closed when the pair which are above them perceive, and that when the pair above are closed those which are beneath should be opened.\" \" The problem is an interesting one, assuredly, but it has hitherto baffled all the researches of science, and I am inclined to think that its solution is among the reserved secrets of Heaven. Perhaps many of the phenomena of modern spiritualism might find their explanation in such a theory ; and what is very strong presumptive evidence is the coincidence we almost invariably find, when circles of that description are formed, between the views and feelings of the invokers and the invoked. In a circle of free-thinkers, for example, the"], [151, "VERONIA. 145 communications received are always of the same tendency, while in one composed, on the contrary, of persons in whom the senti ment of veneration predominates, this senti ment will be echoed back.\" \" I have observed the same thing, and I think with you, Marquis, that the notion of a complex being would perfectly account for this, on the principle of a reflection of ideas. This is more likely than the spiritu alist doctrine, the absurdity of which outrages common sense. For my \"own part, notwithstanding Count Alamistakeo's account of the wonders of his own age, I am inclined to think that, in many respects, our own surpasses, not only it, but all that ever went before it. The wonderful incon gruities of the nineteenth century stamp on it an individuality surely as novel as eccen tric. What, for instance, can be more contradictory than the combination of posi tivism and supernaturalism of our day? Romance must be materialized, but at the same time fantasticism (to coin, perhaps, a word) has no longer any limits, and may soar to any height. Wonders, to which those related in the ' Arabian Nights' Entertain ments ' are pale, meet us at every step, are VOL. III. L"], [152, "146 VERONIA. affirmed to us by every babbler. Things of pure imagination \u2014 the beautiful crea tions which charmed our early years \u2014 must be thrust out of memory, contemptuously trodden under foot, because the world has grown too wise, forsooth, for dreams ; but we are seriously called upon to recognize and do homage to ideas such as that of the divine Plato, Aristotle, or Socrates, as the case may be, revisiting earth under the appearance of a table on one leg.\" \" True,\" answered St. Gregoire, with a smile ; \" it sounds absurd beyond expres sion, and yet you, who have witnessed some of these phenomena, must admit that there is material enough in them to give specula tion its very wildest range. The utter frivolity of many of the communications, and the apparent insignificance of their aim, are, I think, the most reasonable argument against their spiritual origin ; but to deny the existence of such beings as those to whom they are imputed is idle. The old world learning abounds in references to these elementary spirits \u2014 neither souls nor angels \u2014 of whom Josephus, Michael Psellus, and others have treated, and for which a later philosophy has furnished the designa-"], [153, "147 VERONIA. tion of larves. It is these \u2014 if spirits of any kind they really are \u2014 which are the rappers of our day.\" A low, savage whine at this moment startled the two gentlemen, and turning ___) 7 O they beheld a sight which in an instant blanched with horror the Count's always pale cheek. Approaching from a shrubbery which terminated the terrace, the figure of a lady was gliding softly towards them, the bull dog of Sir Douglas's presentation preceding her by a few steps, retained only by a blue ribbon tied round his massive throat. A glance at the white dress, and the graceful step of the wearer, showed De Briedieu who it was, and a look of mingled agony and passion contracted his features as he recog nized her. A shriek from the group of ladies, and a simultaneous exclamation from all the gen tlemen, including the perfidious Scotsman, appeared \u2014 to judge by her silvery laugh as she reached them \u2014 only to delight Her minie. \" He has such a sweet temper that though I have been teasing him, he only whined as you have just heard,\" said she, in l2"], [154, "148 VERONIA. playful tones, though pulling provokingly at the animal's chain. \" Savage, Savage, I am afraid you are scarcely worthy of your name.\" 15 Another low, menacing whine, which made the group of ladies shudder, and chilled the Count's blood in his veins, was the expressive answer. It was evident by the sidelong, murderous look of the creature's bloodshot eye, and the way in which it licked its horrible pendent lip, that the instinct of ferocity was strong within it ; and wonder at the lady's temerity was the predominating feeling in all who witnessed her approach. Madame de St. Bartelemy was the first to break the astonished silence, as, retreating a few steps, she exclaimed, energetically \u2014 \" In the name of Heaven, gentlemen, secure that animal before we are all sacrificed to Madame de Mont Brison's madness. Her minie, if you do not wish to see me faint, give up that string, and let the creature go.\" \" I can assure you, madame, there is not the immediate danger you imagine,\" said Sir Douglas, as he stepped forward to execute this mandate, and take the ribbon from Herminie's hand ; \" however terrible, savage,"], [155, "149 VERONIA. he may be in the exercise of his profession, he is too well-bred to forget he is now in the presence of ladies ; still, as our hostess wishes him to depart, pray allow me, Madame de Mont Brison, to remove him.\" Herminie had glanced meanwhile coquettishly towards the Count, to see the degree of torture he might be suffering on her account ; but after the first look of emo tion neither a sign nor gesture betrayed how he was affected ; he merely turned away coldly, and re-entered the house, while St. Gregoire, indignant at this cruel game, fol lowed him. \"Now that the inseparables are gone,\" exclaimed Herminie, hiding her mortification under an appearance of delight, as she dragged her pet within the very group of ladies, \" you shall all know the secret, but you must not betray it for the world.

To give a semblance of justice to his wishes was not difficult. \" At a word from him another light was brought, and placed so as to cast its full reflection upon the features of Lanoix and those of the corpse, but the course of the vessel was not stayed. \"Valbue cast around a scrutinizing glance ; then, stepping forward, he asked, \" ' Are all the ship's company present ?

On entering the public room I found there two travellers, who, like myself, had sought refuge from the bad weather. They were evidently artists, if not by profession, at least by taste, as the scattered contents of a portfolio, which lay beside them, immediately indi cated. Both were men of good counte nance, and on the breast of the elder of them \u2014 whose air and bearing bespoke military training \u2014 hung the cross of the Legion of Honour. For some time I was a silent listener to their conversation, which soon interested me, and before long I took part in it, and was invited to inspect the drawings in question. These consisted chiefly of sketches of the scenery around, and were evidently the work of no mean hand. \" ' This is not my usual style,' said he who wore the decoration, ' but to an artist half the pleasure of a ramble consists, I think,"], [176, "170 VERONIA. in putting on paper the impressions it has conveyed to the mind.' \" ' Yes,' added the other, turning to me, ' but his forte ' \u2014 indicating his companion \u2014 ' lies elsewhere.

In the trading vessel in which he had taken his passage a fierce and deadly mutiny had broken out.

Springing like a panther among the ruffians, and planting himself before their victim, he dared them to come on against him, and so powerful was the effect of this unsupported daring and hero ism, as well as, doubtless, so terrible the aspect of the indignant man, that the cowardly assailants were cowed by it, and they hesitated to attack him, until some of the party, touched by a better spirit, de clared themselves in favour of their captain and his defender. Then, indeed, ensued a bloody contest, whose details will not bear to be dwelt on, but which ended in the com"], [178, "172 VERONIA. plete subjugation of the mutinous party. Having secured the ringleaders, the re mainder steered their course safely home wards, and on reaching France, concluded the narrator of this adventure, 'the cap tain's gratitude drew attention to my friend, and obtained for him the honourable reward he had so well merited. \" The intelligent conversation of the two strangers, their politeness, and the story thus unaffectedly related,\" added the Count, \" interested me not a little, and, as I found later on inquiry that the story was not only true, but that the chief actor in it was in every way worthy of esteem, I introduced him to my father's house, and on more inti mate acquaintance with him I found him possessed of all the qualities of a noble minded and large-hearted man.\" \" Thanks, Count, not only for the story, but for the delicacy with which you left all the wounds and bloodshed entirely to our imagination,\" said his hostess, graciously. \" I am sure we are greatly obliged to you.\" \"And must certainly admire your hero,\" added Madame de Mont Brison ; \" in fact, I would give the world to see him ; heroes are not to be met with every day.

The comparative freedom of country life \u2014 the opportunities which it offered of more frequent and less restrained intercourse, seemed, as he had fondly anticipated, to fa vour Adrian de Boisvante's ambitious hopes respecting Veronia, and he had become im patient to discover exactly the position he now held in her regard. Independently of love, the equally strong motive of interest would have swayed him. It was quite cer tain that his cousin would obtain a hand some share, if not an entire moiety, of his uncle's fortunes, and a marriage with her, if speedily concluded, would thus relieve him from his embarrassments by giving him the instant command of her dowry. Although the nearness of their relation ship might, and probably would, he thought, form a temporory obstacle to obtaining the"], [181, "175 VERONIA. Duke's consent, yet it would by no means be an insurmountable one ; and having weighed all these reasons, his mind reverted to the lady herself. That Veronia had passionately resented his previous desertion he was fully aware, but that she had loved him he was also convinced, and under the influence of love what will not woman forgive ? That her manner towards him continued cold was not surprising, for curious and jealous eyes were watching her ; but her former ill-con cealed disdain had merged into an appear ance of indifference, which the vanity of his sex vainly persuaded him was but assumed. Filled with these thoughts then, he de cided to bring the question to an issue. It was Mademoiselle de M_)hul's habit to descend into the garden very early in the morning, to enjoy \u2014 which became difficult later in the day \u2014 an hour's quiet reading or commune with her own thoughts; and, aware of this habit, though he had never yet ventured to take advantage of it, Adrian now determined to do so, for the purpose of learning his fate from her lips. Veronia was pacing the terrace walk, and contemplating with a pleased eye the lovely"], [182, "176 VERONIA. prospect which lay before her. The morn ing air had brought her cheek that soft purple bloom which is the freshness of the brunette, and De Boisvante at that moment thought her restored to the posses sion of the rich beauty she had possessed before sorrow's leaden hand had pressed so heavily upon her. \" Have I your permission, my dear cousin, to join you for a few minutes?\" said he, with the high-bred courtesy which he could practise to perfection. Veronia's colour deepened, but this in voluntary evidence of feeling was the only one she betrayed, and her manner was serenely polite as she acceded to his request. For some moments they walked onwards in silence, Mademoiselle de Mehul being evidently resolved not to commence the conversation, and De Boisvante, notwith standing his talent for dissimulation, feel ing embarrassed. Had the case been one in which only pure deceit and unmitigated falsehood were required, he was the man to have mastered it triumphantly, but he was unnerved by the leaven of real feeling which influenced him, and like every man in whom artifice has replaced nature, he"], [183, "177 VERONIA. became inevitably a coward before the real in sentiment or action. The wish to impress Veronia with his sincerity, mingled with some lingering doubt of her actual state of feeling towards him, lent a slight tremor to the tone in which he said softly : \" The happy days that have been passed here are gliding too rapidly away, hurrying us relentlessly onward to those when we must again re-enter that cold and heartless world where the heart dare so seldom speak. It is this thought that gives me courage to approach you with a question which has trembled upon my lips a thousand times since I have had the immense happiness of being again so near you ; Veronia, am I at length understood?\" \" In what sense, monsieur?\" asked she, with a cold calmness that to a man of less pretensions would have been almost a death blow to all hope, and turning towards him as she spoke a face on which was plainly written the most profound indifference as to what his meaning might be. \u2022 De Boisvante felt that the repulse was keen, and for a moment was at a loss how VOL.

Remember what I have already suffered \u2014 think of our past love.\" To quote an ancient proverb, these last words of De Boisvante^ \"put the rose to the wreath,\" Veronia's brow, cheek, and neck grew crimson, her beautiful liquid glance seemed changed to fire as she turned it upon her former lover with one look of such unutterable scorn, as, joined to her expressive silence, was too eloquent of deep, undying contempt to leave on his mind \u2014 all sanguine as he was \u2014 a doubt of the position which he now held in her regard, and the vehemence of his disappointment could no longer be restrained. \" And yet you loved me ? \u2014 deny it not ; you suffered bitterly at the thought of my desertion, and when a woman has once loved thus, mademoiselle, she cannot break her chain so easily ; you will love me again, nay, your very resentment proves that you love me still.\" \" Listen to me, Monsieur de Boisvante,\" said Veronia, in a voice whose mortal calm ness contrasted with the pallor that had n2"], [186, "180 VERONIA. now stolen to her cheek ; \" listen to me, and observe that I speak without anger or pas sion of any kind. That you should force me to lay bare thus the recesses of my heart, to analize for your pleasure feelings so long extinct, does not surprise me, though I should term it unmanly in another. But let that pass \u2014 what I have now to say, difficult as you may find it to believe, is this : I never loved you ; and stranger still, it is not long since this truth revealed itself to me. There is such a thing as thinking that we love, and yet not loving in reality. Such was my case. You charmed, you interested me, I admired you, and, in the romantic ardour of a young girl's mind, conceiving that this charm, this interest, and this admiration constituted love, I elevated you in my ima gination to the place of an idol. But a change came \u2014 you know its origin \u2014 grief and solitude are keen searchers of the spirit, and bring to light many hidden things. They taught me a lesson it would be well could every woman learn \u2014 the knowledge of my own heart. Let peace be between us ; more than this there can never be ; unless time, and your own rectitude of conduct, shall, as I hope earnestly they"], [187, "181 VERONIA may, one day restore to you my esteem.\" With a gesture full of lofty though gentle dignity, the speaker moved a,waj. De Boisvante\" remained standing for a few seconds on the same spot, trembling with anger and humiliation. As the last glimpse of her figure vanished from the terrace, he raised his hand in a menacing attitude towards it. \" She loves, perhaps, elsewhere, and if so her troubles are not over. I will be re venged,\" muttered he. On vows like this some evil spirit ever waits. Although the above conversation had not been overheard, the interview of Veronia and her cousin had been witnessed. As Mademoiselle de M^hul crossed the hall on returning to her own apartment, the slinking figure and mean face of Madame de St. Bartelemy's confidential companion crossed her path. At the breakfast-table that day Adrian's place was vacant. The lady of the chateau stated that her maid had brought her a little note from him, half an hour before, saying that he had received a summons to Vendome, to organize a large shooting-party, which was to meet in the Forest on the"], [188, "182 VERONIA. opening of the season, and that he could not name the exact day of his return. \" I never knew before that my cousin was so enthusiastic a sportsman,\" said the fair Herminie ; while Veronia's heart beat with a sense of relief at the intelligence, and a feeling of cruel embarrassment seemed lifted from her mind."], [189, "183 CHAPTER XIII. Morning, early, early morning ! Earth, ovely and glistening, had awoke, but her children were sleeping still. Sleeping ! and perchance what a sleep ! Pursuing in dreams the scenes of sin or suffering to be enacted yet ; while the glory of Heaven shed its soft reflection over the bosom of that world which was to be so soon again profaned. Morning, early morning ! A dream-like beauty floated over all ; the majesty of the Eternal Presence was abroad, and the loveliness of nature was worshipping it silently. Bird, insect, flower, and foliage were re velling in the transports of their own pure joy, snatching the brief hour of their tri umph, before that of cruel man should have commenced. Soon, too soon, would he"], [190, "184 VERONIA. awake, and rise to meet them with red hands, fierce eyes, or, at the best, with sighs and tears ! Yes ! one of the race of Adam was there already ; his brow was sad and stern, his eye indifferent to the beauty on which it looked, his step both sharp and weary. Sorrow or passion had visited him, like his fellows ; why was he not resting from them also, instead of intruding their shadow on so fair a scene ? Once again he stood, a solitary wanderer in a sweet Southern valley ; he had sought the old dwelling, whose strange occupant had ministered to his former pain, fearless, at that hour, that any curious glance could mark his presence. And he was safe. No eye but his was there to note the tranquil beauty around ; no hand had brushed the dew from off those happy flowers \u2014 rose,olematis, and jessamine, which were wandering in wildluxuriance over the grey walls, their odourfloatinglike incense on the fresh morning air. Bird and butter fly were gladly roving there, and scarcely did the foot of the intruder startle them from their feast of joy ! All was rapture and un broken peace."], [191, "185 VERONIA. The traveller moved softly forward, as though he, too, would fain acknowledge the holy influence that seemed abroad. He reached the balustrade of stone, and leant upon it while contemplating the view before him ; and, as he did so, a change came over his troubled features \u2014 some softer feeling had subdued their sternness \u2014 they worked con vulsively a moment beneath it, and then a tear stole slowly from each sullen eye- What thought, what memory had the scene called up ? Some long passed away, but dearly cherished still \u2014 youth, decked in gor geous fancies and rich beauty ! Love, with its heaven cloudless as evanescent ; friend ship, as he had known it \u2014 a more enduring but no less final deception \u2014 and death \u2014 the death of the beloved \u2014 the end of all! These, perhaps and sadder memories thronged to the wanderer's mind, until the beauty around him turned to bitterness, the silence to pain. He moved abruptly to the door, and struck sharply upon it. There was a slight sound within the dwel ling, but it died away. Impatiently he knocked again ; again there was no reply. \" It is, perchance, too early yet,\" was the reflection of the traveller, and, striking into"], [192, "186 VERONIA, the path which led to a wood behind the dwelling, he wandered away again, lost in saddening thoughts, while above him the happy birds warbled their notes of joy, and all and everything that met his sight breathed gladness. The first tones of the angelus were floating on the air, as an urchin, who had been rambling through the enclo sure, reached the limits whence a view of the old dwelling could be obtained. The figure of a man \u2014 of whom he had, at inter vals, caught sight in the Avood \u2014 was now leaning on the stone balustrade in an atti tude of expectation, and, as the boy marked it, he crossed himself, and tremblingly re peated the words of the angelic salutation. \"At that house, and so early, he must be the evil one himself !

Ave Marias' and, floating softly onwards, came the bells' clear response."], [193, "187 CHAPTER XIV. \" Has anyone seen Monsieur de Briedieu to-day, or what has become of him ?\" asked Madame de Mont Brison, one evening, as the small party remaining at the chateau assembled in the drawing-room at the din ner-hour. \"To be sure, my dear ; did I not tell you that he received a letter, stating that his hero was awaiting him at Vendome, and that he therefore immediately set off to escort that individual to Majestura, so that now, Herminie, your desire of seeing the distinguished personage is likely to be grati fied, as I expect the Count and himself every moment. I only hope that, out of gratitude, you will not allow them to relate to us any more frightful stories, or, at least, not in my presence.\" \" I will use all my influence against it,\""], [194, "188 VERONIA. answered Herminie, laughingly; \"but in general, you know, heroes are satisfied with being silently admired by the weaker sex ; at least, if this one is an exception to the rule, I promise you to crush his pretensions.\" \" That's a good child \u2014 but hush, here they come ! \" The servant entered, and announced Mon sieur le Comte de Briedieu, and \u2014 it was im possible \u2014 Veronia looked in amazement at the figure advancing Avith the Count, took note of the brilliant cross suspended on the breast, wondered at the calm dignity of the Avearer, and recognized Jacques Henricart. De Briedieu came forward, smiling trium phant, and for once, indeed, almost beam ing, to present to his hostess the object of his unselfish admiration, and, in the slight stir thus occasioned, no one seemed to notice the start of surprise with which Mademoi selle de Melvul and the stranger recognized each other. In silence Veronia received the latter's also silently offered salutation, embarrassed and timid, she scarce knew why, at the idea of suddenly acknoAvledging her former ac quaintance with him. Not that, as he stood there calm, self-possessed, and if different,"], [195, "189 \"VERONIA. yet in no degree inferior, to those around him, there Avas anything that need have made the proudest blush at the thought of association Avith him, but that she shrunk from the explanation such an avoAval would entail \u2014 the hard and vulgar exercise of Madame de St. Bartelemy's curiosity, or, Avorse still, Herminie's searching and sar castic glance. Henricart saAV the struggle in Veronia's mind ; he thought, not unnaturally, that she had become infected by the spirit of the world, and, while inwardly resolving to meet her wishes to the utmost, yet, at the thought that she disdained him, a flash of such haughty fire shot from his eye as still further paralysed her. St. Gregoire, who, like De Briedieu, possessed the rare quality of ever yielding what was due to another's merit, and Avho had participated in the Count's admiration of Henricart's exploits, became, as the even ing rolled on, more animated, and seemingly interested in the stranger, than even the Count had anticipated.

There are moments when the task of feigning is too hard for the young, and she felt it so now ; so, quietly retreating to a"], [197, "191 VERONIA. solitary table with her embroidery, she sought, at least, to escape observation. From time to time the conversation of Henricart's group reached her, and she lis tened intently when he spoke. He was not, as we have formerly said, a man of much instruction ; the different as pects of nature, and the diversities of men's minds, these had been his books, but he had read them well. To the beautiful, the grand, the true in either he did homage ; from the mean and base he had ever turned aside. Subdued, perhaps, by that soft god, who, while he reigns, will not endure a rival wor ship, Henricart had long emerged from the ' ' red \" fanaticism in which, at our first in troduction of him he had been plunged ; and yet, though her image might have wrought partly to this end, as we have seen, in reality Veronia had little contributed in intention, to the good work. It was Van Helder's kindly irony, his statement of facts, his shreAvd dissection of them, above all, which opened the Southern's eyes, and released him from the cloud of passionate prejudice which had so long darkened his mind. The \" blood-red instincts \" laughingly attri buted to him by Van Helder, had, in truth,"], [198, "192 VERONIA. never been his. Like all brave men, his heart was kind and gentle, in proportion as his soul was ardent, and it had been a re lief to him to lay doAvn the bloody creed which he had too long upheld. The Count's society, and that of other enlightened per sons like himself, had completed the work, by proving to Henricart that the well-born are not necessarily imperious and wicked, like the wretched specimen Avhom he had first encountered ; and thus restored to the exercise of a sober judgment, though he re mained, as before, the fearless advocate of liberty, and of the ! rights of all men to equal justice, yet he no longer bowed his head at the memory of Saint Robespierre. There is a faculty of the mind, called the \"association of ideas,\" by which certain ideas have the power of calling up certain other ideas, for the simple reason \u2014 so far as philosophic inquiry is simple \u2014 that they have once been connected together. This phenomenon took place in Veronia on again meeting Jacques Henricart. Vanished things seemed brought once more vividly before her; they rose again from their grave, and with them the sort of mirror in which the past is represented to certain"], [199, "193 VERONIA. minds ; all Avas palpable and real as ever, but Avhen she turned to contemplate the person Avhose apparition had worked the miracle, there, indeed, Avas a change ; Jacques Hen ricart was no longer the same man. The difference of dress, perhaps \u2014 the effect of contrast with so peculiar a circle \u2014 the time which had elapsed since they had met \u2014 something imperfect in her recollec tion of him \u2014 all these were evoked for expla nations of the mystery, but failed to bring a satisfactory solution. The first impression made by this bronzed and martial visitant, combined with that of his story, had been electric upon all \u2014 that on Veronia, Avhen she recognized in him so old an acquaint ance, perhaps more thrilling still. It was a wonderful and unexpected interruption to the sameness of her life, carrying her back in thought to tenderly-regretted if more troubled days, and sleep fled from her eye lids on the night succeeding it. ___ o She rose, when the dawn broke, sad and restless, and, not fearing at that early hour to meet any other inhabitant of the chateau, descended to the gardens below her win dows. There was a little bower nearly facing them .vhich she was in the habit of VOL. III. o"], [200, "194 VERONIA. frequenting, and feeling too languid to walk, she directed her steps towards it. She had scarcely entered it before Henricart appeared on the threshold. There Avas an instant's mutual silence and slight embarrassment, during Avhich he remained Avith downcast eyes and respectful mien, as if uncertain whether to advance or to retreat, and during that instant Veronia's mind reverted to the malicious construction likely to be put by her hostess and cousin upon this accidental meeting; but this reflection Avas succeeded by an impulse of haughty defiance, of feverish impatience, to Avhich she yielded. The rapid glance also which she had thrown on Henricart had reneAved in her a very natural curiosity to knoAV Avhat had caused the change apparent in him \u2014 for it was great. The anxious lines Avhich she remembered in the past had vanished from his brow \u2014 the tints of his complexion Avere more full of healthy life \u2014 the haggard eyelid, the despondent gait, the symptoms of wearing grief about the whole man, had given place to a brightness, an energy, which made of him another being."], [201, "VERONIA. 195 Veronia had time to note all this with wonder, before he raised his eyes, and when he did so their first look convinced her that he was now a proud, a confident, and perhaps a happy man. The involuntary thought Avhich came with these reflections brought the colour to her cheek ; undignified, trivial as it may seem, she AA'ondered Avhether his love had survived this transformation. The calmly respectful manner, the absence of anything like agitation at a rencontre Avhich formerly would have sufficed to conquer, at least for an instant, his self-possession, seemed to answer in the negative. Veronia was now the least self-possessed of the tAvo. \" I was not aAvare, mademoiselle, that I should be so unfortunate as to intrude, or, believe me, I should not have done so,\" said Henricart, on meeting her eye, speak ing in the same gentle tone, with perfect courtesy, but far more proudly than of old. \" On the contrary, monsieur,\" answered she, frankly, though the colour again mounted to her cheek as she did so, \" you have not disturbed me in the least ; it is o2"], [202, "196 VERONIA. rather, believe me, a pleasure to meet so old a friend.\" And, as if to prove her assertion, she again resumed the seat from which, in the first surprise of seeing him, she had half risen. A slight, almost imperceptible change of feature, the ghost of a sarcastic smile, was apparent in Henricart at this movement, but it was so transient that Veronia saw it not, and she continued more confidently than before. \" I wished to ask, monsieur, whether you are likely to revisit St. AndreAv's again, or see Dr. Van Helder ? I have some presents ready for himself and little Beth, which I should be very glad, Avere you going there, to confide to your care.\" \" It Avould have made me happy, made moiselle, undoubtedly to have been of any ser vice to you, but I fear you might not like to see your commissions so long delayed. I am going to St. AndreAv's some day, cer tainly, but I at present purpose spending some time in Paris.\" \" That Avill do perfectly, monsieur, as we shall probably meet there again.\" Henricart bowed in silence."], [203, "VERONIA. 197 \" Dr. Van Helder Avill hear, with the same pleasure as Ave have done, the recital of your adventures, Monsieur Henricart. Surely you Avill never again resign yourself to the tame insipidity of eA'ery-day, matter of-fact life after such excitement, such dis tinction. Ah ! that is living indeed, though our circle here Avould be shocked at my boldness in saying so. But truly this life of society is a living death.\" Henricart looked up at the sigh which accompanied these Avords, and rather a pecu liar smile flitted over his face. \" Excitement has its charms, doubtless, to the calmest of us,\" said he, \"but in this case there were some dark shades in the picture too ; still, as you say, mademoiselle, there was life in it, and that is everything. Some of these hours I would not have ex changed for years of ordinary existence. The spectacle of dawn as I have witnessed it, dreamlike, sublime, entrancing; the magnificence of that broad ocean, the differ ent and ever-changing aspects of its majesty, the intoxicating draughts of pure, inspiring air, in Avhich the spirit seemed to drink in freedom as an elixir, while the body drank in health ; all these were pleasures, keen,"], [204, "198 VERONIA. exquisite, unequalled, and I enjoyed them fully.\" He looked up smilingly with the clear, unclouded glance of one from Avhose mind long-haunting shadows have passed aAvay. It Avas the backward look of the captive at his prison bars, Avhen he has once more tasted the air of liberty, and feels himself a free man, and \u2014 oh ! woman, Avoman ! \u2014 Veronia's bosom sAvelled for an instant with something almost like regret. This man whom she had despised as an inferior could feel then, with the heart of a poet, all those lovely things which the teaching of her caste had made her believe that it Avas only their privilege rightly to enjoy. He could face danger too, choosing death rather than dishonour, as nobly as the highest gentleman, and \u2014 more than all, where Avoman's heart is to be won \u2014 he could show himself proud enough to be no longer her slave, and to conquer the love that had been so disdained. Thought, how rapid is it ! All this had passed through the mind of Veronia before Henricart's smile had died away, and the involuntary mortification which it had called up, betrayed itself in the faintest"], [205, "199 VERONIA. tinge of sarcasm in her accent when she spoke again. \" You will, perhaps, feel tempted, Mon sieur Henricart, to embrace the profession of the sea altogether ?\" \" No, mademoiselle,\" he answered, simply, \" I must I fear accept a more prosaic future, for I am not young enough to change my whole career. It is not given, you know, to all men to carve out their own destiny, that is reserved for heroes alone.\" A sentence trembled upon Veronia's lip, but it remained unspoken, for an emotion powerful, though indefinable, made her shrink for the first time Avith something very much akin to timidity before this man. She dared no longer speak to him Avith the encouraging kindness of old times, for he was no longer a fitting object for her pity, and she noAv in her turn felt humbled. Her silence seemed to the speaker a signal to terminate the conversation, Avhich he promptly obeyed. So, with a rather stately apology for having so long detained her, Jacques Henricart boAved Ioav and re tired. Veronia appreciated the delicacy thus displayed, and acknowledged to herself, as"], [206, "200 VERONIA. she had often done before, that Henricart had that true attribute of a gentleman, thoughtfulness in little things. For some moments after he had moved aAvay, she remained forgetful of all around her ; her thoughts Avere on that restless sea described by him, she was drinking in im agination its life-inspiring breeze ; the world and all its littlenesses had faded from her view. Oh ! for the freshness, the joyous ness, of such a scene ! Oh ! for release from the solitude to which her heart was condemned amid all the brilliant scenes of the great world ! Oh ! for life as the dreams of youth had painted it, or else es cape from the wearing frivolity of her pre sent existence even in the convent's silent depths! So sped the long, dreamy autumn days, so golden, glorious, and calm. Yet one heart there felt not their influence, scarce saAV their beauty. Veronia Avas unhappy. The remembrance of De Boisvante's suit, the dread of his return, unnerved her ; the presence of her only two female companions had become each day more intolerable, and she could hope for no release from it until they chose to revisit Paris, since etiquette"], [207, "VERONIA. 201 forbade her returning Avithout their escort ; and more than all, to this Avas added a pang of self-reproach.

With St. Gregoire and the poet he seemed each day to become, more inti mate, and charmed at this communion with superior minds, he lingered at the chateau, where Veronia now saw clearly that her own presence had lost all power to have else retained him."], [208, "202 CHAPTER XV. \"Sir Douglas and his companion announce their return for this evening,\" said Madame de St. Bartelemy, one morning, as her guests met round the breakfast-table. \"Having, I suppose, exterminated every living beast and bird in the forest,\" laughed Madame de Mont Brison, Avhose quick glance had taken note of Veronia's sudden change of colour at this announcement ; \" and you, my cousin,\" turning to the latter, \" have received, I think, news from our dear uncle this morning.

The human mind has curious subtleties, else Avhy should the proud Veronia shrink as she shrank in reading the proposal, less from the prospect Avhich it held out, than from the terms in which it Avas conveyed. Was it not true, as urged the Duke, that her birth, no less than her adoption by him, entitled her to all the honour of such an alliance, and put, in fact, almost impassable barriers to a less lofty one ? Was it not true that she belonged noAv to aAvorld whose jealous pride exacted nothing less than ab solute submission to its decrees in such cases, and, above all, was not the argument just which recalled to her the expediency of ac quiring a protector against that evil day when Heaven should have recalled her pre sent one to itself.

The Count Avas earnestly describing to his hostess and Madame de Mont Brison some effect of forest scenery which he had witnessed that morning, Avhile Henricart stood beside the group, a silent and atten tive listener. Suddenly Veronia saw him start back, as if with horror, while his glance seemed fastened upon some object before him, and following the direction of it, she perceived, upon the threshold of the door, the figures of Sir Douglas and Adrian de Boisvante\\ The latter shrank back, as if politely to give precedence in entering the room to his companion ; but another motive spoke in the livid hues reflected on his conscious face, for he had met the stern glance of his enemy. Surprise was for a moment the predomi nant feeling of Mademoiselle de Meliul, and then an anxious thrill shot through her heart. Where had they met before then, these two men, each of whose lives had been so curiously interwoven with her own destiny ?"], [217, "211 VERONIA. Whence arose the dread secret between them, Avhich that one glance had so elo quently revealed ? A summons to the dining-room, and the sound of Madame de Mont Brison's silvery laughter, aroused Veronia from the stupor of surprise into which she had fallen. \" Indeed, Sir Douglas, I am afraid you will appear yet in some cause celebre. My cousin looks like the ghost of himself. I am not, in fact, at all satisfied that it is not his ghost, and that you have not hunted him to death in that great forest \u2014 it was very cruel of you ! \" And, amid an animated defence from the Scotsman, a pompous eulogium on his suc cessful sport from Madame de St. Barte lemy, and the Marquis's courteous accents, the party proceeded to table. A restraint, observable even to the ab stracted Veronia, hung over the guests. The Count, chilled and uneasy at the return of his vivacious rival, was silent and sad. De Boisvante\" attempted to veil his agitation be neath the jest and repartee, of which he was in general so accomplished a master, but his hand trembled, and his cheek flushed at mo ments, as his glance reverted, half-defiantly, p2"], [218, "212 VERONIA. half-involuntarily, compelled apparently by some occult power, towards the stony face and rigid figure of Jacques Henricart. When invited by Monsieur de Briedieu to accompany him as a guest to the cha teau of Majestura, the name of its owner had, of course, recalled to the artist no con nection with the family of Veronia, and great, accordingly, had been his surprise on recognizing her as one of its inmates. The thought of her hated cousin, if it recurred to him, had not hitherto troubled his enjoy ment, inasmuch, as not having heard De Boisvante's name mentioned, he had no fear or anticipation of ever being brought in con tact with him, and his sudden apparition had been, therefore, all the more terrible. Thoughts akin to these had been, mean while, passing through Adrian's mind. Hoav could he ever have divined the possi bility of such a meeting ? This ruffian, as he had formerly qualified Henricart, was then the hero of the Count's story, and, as his eye rested upon the cross of the legion of honour, which hung on his enemy's breast, the base and jealous heart of De Boisvante\" burnt with vengeful and jealous rage. The party moved back to the drawing-"], [219, "213 VERONIA. room, where awaited them some guests from a neighbouring chateau, whose visits were frequent at Majestura. The day had been sultry, and as, a frequent consequence, the evening was less warm and beautiful than usual, instead of Avandering into the gardens, the guests lingered, some be neath the verandah, and some amid the luxurious chairs and couches in the proxi mity of the open casements. Veronia, who had retreated to the furthest of them, saw, with a feeling of painful embarrassment, the tall figure of the Marquis approaching her, and soon a few courteous though serious words from him claimed her attention. He had merely approached her to men tion that one of the new arrivals, a lady of remarkable vocal talent, and gifted, it was said, with a rare soprano, was about to sing, and then he discreetly moved away. Twilight had fallen, but, at the request of the guests, no light in the draAving-room had replaced that of day, all feeling how much the \" dim religious light \" Avould en hance the charms of music, and the song stress being too accomplishad a musician to need the aid of either book or taper. Gra dually a silent group had gathered around"], [220, "214 VERONIA. the instrument at which the lady was seated ; a group, however, which did not include Veronia, Avho, half-hidden. beside the drapery of the Avindow at which she was seated, re joiced inwardly at the brief interval of quiet which allowed her to indulge more freely the thoughts, that, since morning had so agitated her mind. The song had commenced. Placed thus apart from the circle of listeners, Mademoi selle de Mehul could watch it unobserved. Hoav much may the student of character glean in stolen moments like these, when, drawn together by common impulse or in terest, the observed are unconscious of being the objects of the observer ! The student of character, Ave say \u2014 yes, like all those who have suffered deeply, Veronia had be come such, involuntarily perhaps, in self-de fence. It had become a habit of her mind to dive beloAV the surface, to analyze and to compare. She was no longer the woman whom the graces of a De Boisvante\" could dazzle, or to be won even by the more noble attractions of a St. Gregoire or a De Brie dieu ; her eye, perhaps, had grown less fastidious, but her judgment had become more so. Though still young, she had"], [221, "215 VERONIA, reached that stage of feeling which, to or dinary Avomen, comes only with riper years ; in which, briefly, the Avarmth and passion of girlhood, as compared with the love she might noAV feel, Avould be only, to use the poet's Avords, \" as moonlight unto sunlight, and as water unto wine,\" difficult to awaken, perhaps, but, when once kindled, striking into the deepest fibres of the heart, to be uprooted thence only with the anguish of death itself. Such was Veronia noAV. Separated then from the group of lis teners, she looked on. Most of them formed a fitting subject of study, and as her eye glanced round the vast saloon from face to face she thought how well each counte nance served as an index to the mind which it represented. Nearest to her leant the graceful person of Adrian de Boisvante ; eye and lip Avere smiling, although a silent tempest raged within. One slender, polished hand rested on his hip, in an attitude of studied negli gence. Nothing more gracious than the entire figure could be imagined. Veronia's eyes rested reflectively on it for some minutes, and as they did so, she thought of a sentence she had that morning read, to"], [222, "216 VERONIA. the effect that \" a man may possibly desire no more refined vengeance on his enemy than to grant him the wish that lay nearest his heart five years previously.\" Five \u2014 ay, two years before, Avhat place had this man held in her affections ? She turned away with a shudder ! Close to the subject of it stood St. Gregoire. A languor, less of melancholy than of overwrought refinement, overspread his features ; but Veronia knew that it was rather the effect of breeding than nature, and no feeling of unkind criticism awoke within her. \" The true gentleman is ahvays tender of the feelings of others, ahvays watchful lest he should unintentionally wound, always thinking, when with others, of their pleasure instead of his own. He casts but few shadoAvs.\" Of the Marquis all this was true. High-bred, amiable, and accomplished, shadows indeed generally vanished before his serene presence and his courteous smile.

The Count de Briedieu came next, and to him Mademoiselle de Mehul, in common with all Avho approached him, turned Avith interest. A more perfect type of the poet \u2014 the man of intensest feeling and refinement \u2014 could scarcely have been found. Hoav deli cate was the susceptibility of his nature, his expressive countenance too painfully re vealed. We have said before that its pre dominant character was that of sadness. Alas ! to such as De Briedieu does not ex istence \u2014 under its present conditions \u2014 abound in countless links of pain ? He was listening intently to the music, and at a passage of peculiar sweetness and pathos, Veronia marked how his eye kindled and softened as it turned with a look of ineffable tenderness toAvards the heartless Herminie. Veronia saw too hoAv the vain widoAv re ceived his homage, and her generous woman's heart bounded with indignant pity. Involuntarily now she looked towards Henricart."], [224, "218 VERONIA. He stood there, amid that brilliant group, on sufferance, the man of the people ; how distinct in every characteristic from them all, and Lamartine's eloquent description of a hero flashed into Veronia's memory as her eye rested upon him. \" Something rough, rude, and savage in his movements revealed his southern and insular origin. The man of the Mediterranean broke out constantly through the Frenchman. His nature, too great and powerful for the part he had to play, overflowed on all occasions. He bore no resemblance to any of the men around him. Superior, and altogether different, he was an offspring of the sun, of the sea, and of the battle-field.\" Yes, as truly as the man of pleasure, the man of science, and the man of feeling Avere typified by De Boisvante, St. Gregoire, aud De Briedieu, was the man of character and passion shown forth in him Avho answered so Avonderfully to this sublime description. A thrill of pride shot through Veronia's heart : associations sad, yet tender, rushed to her recollection. She heard again the mur mur of that northern sea, the sighing of the wintry gale; again the dim landscape spread out colourless before her, sere as her"], [225, "219 VERONIA. OAA'n life, chill as her own hopes ; again in spirit she fainted at that open grave, while strange, hard faces pressed cruelly around her ; again, too, the firm and pitying hand Avas stretched to save her, and a face in Avhich were mingled, how strangely, stern ness and patience, was bending over her. Oh ! Avoman admires resolution, daring, im petuosity in her master, if need be, but there is a quality Avhich falls more irresistibly than even these upon her heart. The bitterest sigh that regret had ever wrung from her escaped now from the proud girl's breast. \" Hell,\" says Richard Cecil, \" is the truth seen too late.\" Veronia felt \u2014 too late, indeed \u2014 she could have loved Jacques Henricart. There is a love, sudden, imperious, bewildering, in Avhich imagination plays the leading part. There is another love, in which the heart is first gently subdued, the mind meets the charm half-way, and thus the spell is wrought, the key-note of sympathy has been struck, and soul, mind, and heart combine to echo it. This is the true \u2014 the only love worthy the name."], [226, "220 VERONIA. We wonder, sometimes, that it is so rare; but then we forget the trinity which is re quired to create it. We have all souls, doubtless ; but how many of us yield to their supremacy? We have all minds, too; but how many of us are under their in fluence ? Lastly, are we really all gifted with that which it is customary to term a heart ? Well, love requiring the concurrent efforts of these three, can we wonder that it should be so rare, so almost apocryphal a senti ment? To attain to the comprehension of it, Veronia had passed through a sharp noviceship, and now that she had reached the end of her probation, it Avas too late. She Avas only, indeed, fulfilling the common destiny of mortals; but it seemed more bitter to her from all that she had already undergone. She knew not of Jacques Hen ricart's sacrifice \u2014 a word, and a passing look, were all the evidence that she had ever had of his devotion ; but the little that she did know had long since awakened in her a woman's deepest trust and gratitude. What wonder that time and contrast had made this ripen to a woman's gloAving admiration?"], [227, "221 CHAPTER XVI. Although they had sat together at the same table, and spent the hours of the succeeding evening in the same drawing-room, without further evidences of hostility than had passed in the one glance which had been detected by Veronia, yet the imvard resolve of both Adrian de Boisvante and Jacques Henricart had been that those hours should be the last that found them beneath the same roof. And yet, though in heart a dastard, the former recoiled from the shame of retreat- ing before his enemy ; and, intolerable as he felt the presence of the latter, he could yet scarcely resign himself to such an alterna tive, so that, when on descending, on the following morning, rather later than usual, to the breakfast-room, he learnt from his"], [228, "222 VERONIA. hostess that one of her guests had been under the necessity of leaving Majestura early on private business, and he found that guest to be Henricart, great was his satisfaction. His late absence from Veronia \u2014 the en livening society of the Baronet, and a few such choice spirits who had shared their sports and wanderings in the forest \u2014 for, indeed, according to the hardy Scotsman's estimation, their excursions had partaken far more of the character of rambles than sports \u2014 all these exhilarating influences had re stored De Boisvante\" to a fair share of his usual levity and self-confidence, and if the recollection of his last interview with Veronia still rankled sorely in his mind, it had, nevertheless, failed quite to extinguish hope. Narrowly as he had watched her, he had never yet seen reason to fear the existence of a favoured rival ; and though he was aware of St. Gregoire's sentiments, and had even some anticipation of what were the latter's intentions, yet his penetration had not been at fault when he conceived that they were little likely to meet with a favour able reception."], [229, "223 VERONIA. The Count, then, had been the only other possible aspirant to Mademoiselle de M_ihul's good graces during his absence, and that De Briedieu's affections were engaged else where, Adrian Avell knew. Of Henricart, notAvithstanding his former passing suggestion to Madame de Mont Brison, he had never seriously entertained such a suspicion for an instant, and, accord ingly, on meeting again the object of his wishes, and being received by her with the same calm and gentle, if cold, manner as before, he felt his hopes rekindle with his desires \u2014 as they do in the case of all men \u2014 and with them his determination to perse vere. When a woman has once loved, argued he, to himself, it is impossible that she can ever become totally indifferent to the person who has inspired her Avith such a sentiment, and, in this supposition, he was correct ; but he either overlooked, or could not bring himself to believe in, Veronia's account of what had been the real nature of her feelings toAvards him, and consequently, the fact escaped him, that no ashes are so cold as those of an illusive love. Reflections like these had drawn De Boisvante into what was for him a most"], [230, "224 VERONIA. unusual state of reverie, when the voice of Herminie aroused him. \" Sir Douglas has brought me a charm ing collection of ferns, Adrian, and he tells me that you have some others ; will you bring them to my boudoir, that I may press them at once, or they will be quite spoilt.\" \" Certainly, my dear cousin \u2014 I really beg your pardon for almost forgetting them,\" ansAvered he, abstractedly ; \" I will fetch them immediately.\" And he departed in obedience to the request. On entering the apartment which had been appropriated to her as a boudoir, De Boisvante found the fair Avidow busily engaged in sorting and arranging the Baronet's contribution, with his aid, and that of Madame de St. Bartelemy 's confi dential attendant ; but on her cousin's entrance the latter was dismissed, and Adrian obliged, much to his annoyance, to supply her place. \" So, Sir Douglas, you, too, think of leaving us !

The usually gay drawing-room of the"], [235, "229 VERONIA. chateau held aching hearts that night, the more aching, perhaps, for the mask of indif ference which each of its occupants had assumed. The Marquis had borne his sentence with the gallant bravery of a proud and noble spirit. He was not of those Avho either pine or die for love ; life held for him other and higher objects, but, for all that, the first flush of his disappointment was as keen as that of other men. Veronia suffered too. She Avas conscious of refusing to make the happiness of a good man, of being still the object of pursuit to a base one, and of having spurned another, whom she Avas now disposed to love. The Count, having found since morning the opportunity of laying his tale of Avoe at the feet of his idol, had received, also, the deathstroke of his hopes. FeAv, indeed, had been the words which had passed between them, but they had sufficed to leave in his heart an ineffaceable impression of bitterness and Avrong. He could not hate. It was long, indeed \u2014 as in all cases of profound attach ment \u2014 ere he learnt how not to love the cruel destroyer of his peace, and for many a long and dreary day his genius sickened"], [236, "230 VERONIA. and wasted, like his courage ; but that pe riod of darkness passed away, as it must ever do to the lofty and valiant of soul ; again he saw life with the poet's eyes, again he sang Avith all the poet's fire, and again he took his place in the world's throng. Yet, could his heart have been laid bare before the eyes of men, one dark spot where death had commenced its work would have ap peared there, and from that darkened corner sprang, perhaps, the brightest of his lays. Poor Count ! Poor poet ! Many now hang enchanted upon his productions who knoAV not the sorrow which gave them birth ; yet in that brilliant world with which, though more rarely than of old, he still mingles, all have marked with interest his features, and wondered, perchance, at the secret of their sadness. To return to the remaining guests at Majestura. Madame de Mont Brison was not the least dissatisfied of them.

Still she had entertained for him the sort of feeling which is the nearest approach to the tender passion of Avhich natures like hers are capable, and she chafed at finding him unsubdued. This was the secret of her sharp dismissal of the Count, whose unfor tunate love might, she noAV thought, have stood betAveen her and this more desired one.

Adrian, as we have said, if not elated, was yet hopeful, unconscious of the cloud so soon to burst upon him. The adieux of the guests had been pro nounced, and the chateau contained now only its originaloccupants \u2014 namely, Madame de Mont Brison, Veronia, Adrian, and their hostess \u2014 and De Boisvante\" found him self, on the morning succeeding these"], [238, "232 VERONIA. departures, in the drawing-room with the former.

We left Carl Dopter, Avith his family, arriving at the Canongate in Edinburgh, and there he had remained ever since. Gretchen's state of sickness and exhaus tion had compelled him to accept the first wretched lodging Avhich presented it self, and the summer had passed over them Avithin its squalid walls.

But time went on, and these poor and uncertain sources of income did not suffice to keep himself and family from the sharp pangs of want, Avhile still no intimation of his patron's arrival cheered his heart.

Late one evening, while Dopter was working manfully upon the portrait of a lady \u2014 the execution of which had been confided to him by the fair original in exchange for some groceries \u2014 his attention was roused by Gretchen's sobs. He sprang to her side, and saw that they had been excited by a sudden change in her poor baby's aspect. The child was dying. Want, despondency, and the absence of Heaven's sunshine, which had blasted the mother, had destroyed her infant, and Avhen night closed in over that desolate room, death mingled with the shadows that hung there. Gretchen's despair mocked all words \u2014 but when, assisted by the friendly sym pathy of a feAv artists scarcely richer than himself, Dopter contrived to get the little body removed to its last resting-place, the mother's physical and mental powers alike gave way, and her frail life seemed shaken to its centre. \" The child ! the child ! \" moaned she, ever and anon opening her eyes and looking"], [245, "VERONIA. 239 mournfully around ; and morning, noon, and night, \" The child ! the child ! \" was all her cry. Carl Dopter was distracted. The fine lady was left neglected in a corner, staring out of the canvas, with one eye blue and the other broAvn, in a ghastly man ner, while he went to and fro around the sor rowing mother, trying vainly to soothe her grief. \" The child is a little angel now, my Gretchen, think of that ! \" said the poor hus band at last, as the thought of the consolation to be derivedfrom that idea suddenly occurred to him \u2014 for he was not much addicted to spiritual thoughts at other times ; and more fully to develop his meaning he continued, \u2014 \" an angel with wings and a robe of light, and so happy that it would not perhaps come back to us if it could \u2014 do you see that, little mother \u2014 are you not consoled ? \" The lamentation ceased for a moment at the sound of his voice. Gretchen looked at him intently Avhile he spoke, as if listening to the argument, but Avhen it was ended, as though the meaning of his words had been quite lost upon her, she took up again her mournful burden Avith the same heartbroken accents as before. Dopter never left her \u2014 he"], [246, "240 VERONIA. saw that the grief that was consuming her was a mortal one, and on the third day he still sat beside her, holding her burning hand in his, and putting aside the thick tresses from her brow. Since the moment of her loss she had neither tasted nourishment nor enjoyed a moment's sleep ; and now, as her weary companion tried to snatch a brief repose, it was broken each instant by the same deso late and ceaseless cry. At last it ceased, the lids fell heavily over her blood-shot eyes, the parted lips were motionless, and the fair young head drooped, with its rich load of silken tress*, as if utterly weighed down by deep exhaustion. Dopter himself, aroused by her silence, now anxiously watched the profound slum ber that rested upon her lids, and saw with relief that the fever spot upon her cheek was slowly fading thence. He thought not of observing it, but the pulse throbbed low and fitfully \u2014 its tide was sinking. The shades of evening Avere filling the dim chamber, and the sounds of life without came up remotely from the Canongate beloAv. The atmosphere of the room was"], [247, "241 A'ERONIA. stifling. A feAV odoriferous plants Avhich poor Gretchen had purchased on their arrival, and which had been neglected since her sorrow, had died for want of water, and Dopter thought that it must be their ex halations that now shed the heavy, death like odour Avhich turned him sick and faint. He thought too that Gretchen's slumber seemed too tranquil to be easily disturbed ; so, gently releasing her hand, he rose and opened the casement, which only then ad mitted a breath of hot and tainted air. Scarcely had he done so, Avhen her voice re called him. \" Carl, Carl, AA'here are you ?\" He was at her side in a moment. She turned, as he bent over her, so as to bring her head upon his arm, and looked up into his face ; his heart stood still with grief and terror, for too clearly did his eye recognize the fiat written on her countenance. \" I am tired, love \u2014 so tired,\" whispered she, faintly, as, trembling with the shock, he turned aside, \" don't leave me, Carl; I could not bear to be alone ; \" but she spoke no longer of the child ; had she forgotten it, thought he, wonderingly. She answered to his thought. VOL. III. R"], [248, "242 VERONIA. \" I am going to our little child, Carl. It was true what you told me, it is an angel, I have seen it, for it came to call me, and that is Avhy I am going.

A hollow rattle, followed by a gasp, as he felt her clasp tighten upon his arm. \" It is dark, Carl, so dark I can see nothing ; are you there ? Carl, Carl ! dear love, the child \u2014 the child is near.\" And so from his arms she sank into the embrace of death. When night came and all was quiet, and the fair body lay smoothed and sheeted for the grave, when no curious eye could watch, and no profane step break in upon his vigil, Carl Dopter took his brush and pallet, and prepared to trace the lineaments of his dead wife. Silently through the long hours of dark ness did he pursue his mournful task, and the first gleam of dawn was peeping through the casement as he finished. He stood a moment ere extinguishing the lamp to con template the awful sleep that closed the"], [249, "VERONIA. 243 loved one's eyes, and then the piercing thought that never, never, through the long years that might be his on earth, they would unclose again ; that never from her lips through life should he again hear those gentle Avords, \" Dear Carl \" \u2014 never again be met upon the threshold of his poor home by her kind smile and loving greeting. All rushed to his remembrance with a sharp and bitter pang, until the reckless artist bent his head and wept. Suddenly rose up from the foul street beneath the sound of drunken revelry and laughter. The tide of crime and misery was full of life as ever ; day was breaking, and with it a world of strife and sin awakening once more, but never could their echoes fall on Gretchen's ear again. For ever and for ever had she done Avith mortal things, and as he looked upon her fair, pale brow, so young, so pure, and stain less, his thoughts stole back to one thus fair and pensive. Once more he stood in memory before that virgin's shrine, once more, as when a boy, he wandered through the long cathedral aisles of his old native city, heard the SAveet solemn tones of sacred music floating softly on, felt holy companies R 2"], [250, "244 VERONIA. of saints and martyrs rising round him and echoing the harmonious chants resounding there, and Gretchen's voice was now among them, bidding him rejoice that she had entered so beautiful a sphere. Why should he mourn, then ? Death, to the pure of heart was but the glorious portal to all lovely things. The fife that she had left \u2014 too well he knew it \u2014 the hard reali ties, the dread deceptions, the weariness \u2014 time brings to all. These she was spared. Sorrow and pain could touch her never more ; and, kneeling by her lifeless figure, uprose, unmurmuringly, from his lips, the parting words, \"Farewell, fareAvell, my Gretchen ; all is well !\""], [251, "245 CHAPTER XVIII. \"If you're not ready for supper, Van Helder, it's ready for you, so I think you had better have it.\" The speaker was Godensca ; but the per son whom she addressed looked more like the ghost of the lively Doctor than like himself. The summer, whose close had been so beautiful elsewhere, had proved unvary ingly wet and chilly at St. Andrew's, and before August closed in, a succession of heavy rains, inundating the country around it, and spreading abroad the dire vapours of its marshes, had produced a sharper influx of fever than had been felt there for years. Many were the victims who had been struck down and palsied by its ravages ; but the last, and almost the worst case among those who had survived it was that of Van Helder."], [252, "246 VERONIA. Like others, more or less he had suffered from it each year ; but, on this occasion, the burden of extra work that had oppressed him, the contagious influence of so many hours of day and night passed in unremit ting devotion to his patients, had told severely upon him, and at length reduced him also to a sick-bed. The circumstance of almost every hour bringing some fresh and pressing case, had induced him to yield to the Cure's entreaties that he Avould take up a temporary residence at the Presbytery, as much for the sake of the sufferers, as to spare himself the extra fatigue of traversing so constantly the dis tance which lay between the village and his own abode, so, after a short resistance, he gave in to the former reason, though he Avould have turned a deaf ear to the latter one. The room which had been appropriated to him was the original one in which we first of all presented him to the reader's notice, the reason for this selection being that from thence he could enjoy the amuse ment of watching his beloved rookery \u2014 an occupation of which, since his illness, he had become doubly fond, and which had formed"], [253, "247 VERONIA. the ground for so many a philosophic dis cussion on things in general, and the dignity of rooks in particular, that the Cure had found it, at times, a hard matter to keep his head above the metaphysical ocean in which Van Helder delighted to plunge \u2014 as the priest laughingly averred, figuratively speaking \u2014 head over heels. It Avas the hour of dusk, and Godensca had entered to make the inquiry we have chronicled ; the Doctor looked up to answer her \u2014 \" Supper, to be sure ; I should like some of the pastor's buttermilk to-night, as a change.\" \" Then you won't have it ; to-day isn't Friday, so you must take the meat-soup I've got for you ; buttermilk, indeed ! when you know you want to get up your strength as fast as you can ; but you always are so con trary.\" \" And what are you, then, to go on sAval lowing your pint of vinegar for supper, night after night?\" exclaimed the indignant invalid, in a tone of unqualified disgust at her tyranny. \" Hold your tongue, Godensca, and fetch Avhat I've got to drink at once, whatever it is, that I may have done Avith it.\""], [254, "248 VERONIA. \" When you are Avell again, you knoAV, Van Helder, you shall have what you like,\" said the handmaiden, Avith an apparently soothing intention ; \" but now you must be steady.\" \" 1 never shall get well while you distress my feelings so,\" remonstrated the Doctor, in a tone of assumed piteousness, but in wardly disposed to be mischievous for the first time since his convalescence ; \" as if buttermilk could hurt me ! You wouldn't be so foolish, Godensca, if you knew all.\" \"AllAvhat?\" asked she, AA'ith aAvakened curiosity, struck by the portentous tone in which he uttered the last Avords. \" Well, a great secret, which I have never yet told to anyone alive, and which you must keep solemnly until I am dead, be cause, if it came to the ears of Dr. Bonnet \" \u2014 the latter had been attending Van Helder during his illness \u2014 \" I don't know what he might not take it into his head to do, and I wouldn't be cut up alive, as you may sup pose, Godensca, for anything.\" \" I should think not, indeed !\" said the latter, astonished, and not a little awe-struck at the idea of what dreadful disclosure this preface might forebode."], [255, "249 VERONIA. \"Well, that might be the most likely thing to happen, if the doctor knew what I am going to tell you now, because he might think that it was this that had given me the fever, and that I should never get well Avith out, do you see ?\" \" No,\" replied Godensca, bluntly, Avith an uncompromising regard to exact veracity, \" I can't make out what you mean at all, or what's the matter ; can't you say it plainer?\" \" It's just this \u2014 but, mind, you never must tell another living soul,\" and the speaker lowered his tone to one of deep and solemn conviction suited to the awful nature of the communication : \" When I was young \u2014 four or five years old, or so \u2014 I sAvallowed a complete packet of pins and needles. I remember doing it perfectly.\" \" Mein lieben moder! what won't you tell me next, Van Helder ? Pins and needles ! why, you Avould have been dead long ago.\" \" No, not exactly ; though, it seems odd, people have been known to do such a thing before now Avithout dying of it, for, gene rally, the objects swallowed worked them selves out at their elbows, or the tips of their heels, perhaps ; and you may remem ber, Godensca, how often in the cold"], [256, "250 VERONIA. weather I've told you I felt pins and needles in my feet \u2014 you may depend upon it they were those which went straight down there, and have never been able to get out.\" Godensca looked at him a moment in tently ; the rustling of a priestly garment made her glance aside, Avhen she perceived her master, who had softly entered the chamber, and Avas now standing, with a per ceptible smile upon his countenance, the evident result of having overheard the Doctor's story. The handmaiden's indigna tion at the deception attempted to be prac tised on her, found vent in Avords. \" I wonder you are not ashamed of your self, Van Helder, to tell such stories ; but it's my belief you'll joke upon your death bed,\" and thus saying, she stalked majesti cally away. On the morning succeeding this scene, Van Helder, stronger and more lively than he had been yet since his illness, was seated in a snug arm chair \u2014 the only one which the Presbytery boasted \u2014 beside his favourite windoAV, on the look-out for his sombre friends, while the Cure\\ engaged in cutting the leaves of a new book, had taken up his station near him."], [257, "251 VERONIA. \" A feAV days hence, Paul, I shall be able to get back to my OAvn nest.

It was the quiet sigh of mingled resignation and regret, but it made his friend uneasy ; and again deter mined to chase away an unwelcome theme, he commenced abruptly : \" The Catholic idea is, hoAvever, splendid. The thought of myriads, separated by differ ences of race, of clime, of instinct, and of training, uniting in one magic circle of belief, is assuredly the most sublime one ever conceived; had society such a basis,"], [259, "253 VERONIA. how glorious might be the destiny of man!\" The Cure\" looked up in surprise. \"Yes, Paul,\" continued the speaker; \"it is not only poets who have dreamt of ' the parliament of man, the federation of the Avorld,' but so stern a mind as that of Napoleon I. had realized the possibility of a constitution of human society, by the association of the peoples.

Civilization might profit largely by the lesson conveyed in it, \"It chimed in admirably with their manner of disposing of their surplus children, as related by Thucydides, I must confess,\" said the Cure, with quiet irony. \" Even so; grant that they were barbarous in the latter respect, how tender, how thoughtful was this, as compared to the course pursued by the refined governments of our day !

From the moment when their names had fallen on his ear, Monsieur de Rochefierre had never stirred. One might have fancied his stern presence a marble creation but for the steady fire of his steadfast eye, recalling the fable of the celestial fire which burnt unchangeably although on mortal altars. The priest looked at him with a feeling approaching awe. During the twenty years that he had ministered to and confessed this man, he had never yet suspected the latent energy which lay hidden beneath that gentle and gracious surface. Amid the calm tenor of his passionless life, the Duke had seemed all mildness, courtesy, or placid dignity, and now, like a war-horse at the first signal of coming tumult, his nature answered to it, and he looked all majesty and power.

Again he was silent. The speaker watched him narrowly for a moment as he stood there gazing sadly into the glowing embers on the hearth ; vexation and bitter ness, not to say remorse, Avere Avritten in every line of his features. A sullen gloom had replaced the haughty carelessness Avhich had ever characterized them, and Herminie's curiosity Avas excited concerning this secret source of mortification existing in his breast. She rose, stepped gently to his side, and laid her hand caressingly on his. \" Adrian, dear Adrian ! I have always thought you loved me \u2014 why close your heart to me now ?

I should have thought you more sensible, Herminie ; above all, I should have thought that you could never pay yourself the bad compliment of sup posing that you ever had been rivalled in my affections.

Such was not, how ever, now the case, for to the pleasure of acquisition was added that of conquest over a long-feared rival, and Avhat woman ever was insensible to this ? Lovelier than ever looked the brilliant schemer as gratified vanity and satisfied ambition dilated her breast ; her soft cheek was flushed, and her beautiful eyes beamed with a light as radiant as that of happy love itself. But her companion saw nothing of all this. Stung and maddened by a thousand secret pangs which, as he felt, must rest for ever hidden in the depths of his oavii breast, even while clasping the hand he had just claimed, he turned away ! Say not, dear reader, that the case is strained to improbability. Not so. The world witnesses some scores of similar ones every day. The door opened, and, announced by a servant, the late Duke de Rochefierre's oldest friend, the Admiral, hobbled in.

Not so De Boisvante, who, glad to escape Herminie's further questioning and the inquisition of her eyes, took the oppor tunity thus offered of gliding aAvay from her presence. As the door closed on him and he stood alone, a deadly pallor settled on his brow ; the Admiral was repeating over his invariable assertion \u2014 \" So like his father, so very like his poor father 1 \" \u2014 and overheard by Adrian, it had recalled to him the dreadful Avord addressed to him by Van Helder. The domestics of the splendid household of which he was now the head wondered as they marked the haggard look with which he passed among them, but they knew not that the sound of \" Bastard ! bastard ! \" was ringing in his ear. At the same hour that this scene Avas passing in Paris, Veronia was pacing once more her gloomy chamber in the convent of Septuagesima.

The confidence in her own power of winning back a ten derness so long withheld from her unhappy mother, and so coveted by her OAvn solitary heart, how had that, too, been shattered at a blow ! Youth and its aspirations had dawned for her once more, to be again oversha dowed and again how cruelly repressed ! Without a word, without a sign of relenting towards her, the stern old Duke had died \u2014 died, believing her unworthy of his blood and name \u2014 and bitter, bitter to Veronia's pride had been that thought ! It had driven her to seek desperately once more for the only comfort her unhappy destiny seemed to reserve for her \u2014 solitude and safety at least from further outrage ; for in the taunting glances of her former lover and Herminie she had read the future that awaited her in the world. And did her thoughts revert to the unconscious instru ment of her disgrace ? \u2014 Avas Henricart re-"], [286, "280 VERONIA. membered ? Yes, but, with womanly inconsistency, unjust and angry bitterness were mingled in the recollection. She could have hated herself for having felt that he Avas Avorthy to be loved, and the thought of ever meeting him again flushed her pale cheek, and made her tremble, even amid the twilight shadows of her lonely chamber. So enamoured as she was of light, and air, and sunshine, there seemed for her then but one course to pursue, and that one was to seek the veil Avhich consecrates the head on which it is laid \u2014 the scapulary beneath Avhich the heart that beats must lie hushed and crucified for ever. \" A letter, Fraulein, and I have brought you a light that you may read it directly,\" said Sister Martina, appearing at the moment Veronia's thoughts had reached this point, with a lamp, whose pale rays only just illuminated the space surrounding her. For an instant Mademoiselle de Mehul looked up anxiously, but then reflecting that she had little more to fear in the future, she took the missive, saw that the handwriting was unknown to her, and listlessly broke the seal."], [287, "281 VERONIA. The first Avords which she read changed her indifference to anxiety. Van Helder was ill ; he had been much prostrated by the effect of his late journey to Paris, and immediately on his return to St. Andrews alarming symptoms had declared them selves. These had subsided, and no instant danger was now anticipated ; but his state was precarious, to say the least ; and as he had expressed an earnest Avish to see Made moiselle de Mehul, the Cure had undertaken to urge his request upon her.

On the day succeeding that on which had occurred the conversation with Veronia, which Ave have detailed, Van Helder had been overwhelmed by so deep an access of exhaus tion, that, for the first time since his illness, some anticipations of danger seemed to be awakened in his mind. His smile and his keen glance had given place to a gravity which seemed the result of some deep pre occupation or some new-born anxiety, but what might be the subject of either none who approached him could tell. Paul Alost watched these symptoms Avith an in describable anxiety, and his communication Avith Dr. Bonnet scarcely reassured him, al though, like most of his discreet confraternity, the latter seemed unwilling to throAv more light upon the case than was absolutely necessary. \" I do not believe in modern miracles, and it needs one of these to restore Van Helder to his accustomed health,\" was the Calvinist's keen remark to the anxious pastor ; \" still nature has vast resources, which are unknown to science, and if such be the will of Heaven he may recover.\""], [307, "301 VERONIA. \" By the blessing of the good God, I hope it,\" said the priest, simply, and no more was said. Veronia lingered watchfully around the sick man's bed. For the first time during their long acquaintance her questions remained unansAvered, and her presence seemed scarcely observed by him, so that serious, and almost frightened, she began to fear the worst. A day and a night had passed thus, when a symptom of returning animation Avas conveyed in a gesture from Van Helder to his host. The Cure\" approached, and his friend Avhispered something in his ear. \" Yes, my dear Jean, before to-morrow it shall be done.\" And at this promise part of the unaccustomed shadoAv which had rested on it passed from the sick man's face, and soon, like one relieved from a weight of care, he sank into repose. And again from that moment he rallied ; the faculties which had been so long, as it were, suspended, appeared once more tri umphantly to assert their existence \u2014 the mysterious poAver of mind over matter was evident; no longer feeble, silent, and fainting, he seemed recalled beneath the"], [308, "302 VERONIA. influence of some stirring motive to an unusual degree of nervous vitality. Like the racer, who, having caught sight of the goal, speeds onward, excited, impatient, and fearful only of delay. The Cure and Bonnet exchanged a glance, as, on awakening from a sleep of many hours, Van Helder sat up, and turned towards them with a smile ; there was some thing peculiar in his aspect which made the priest's heart throb for an instant, and then sink heavily, while the Doctor glided quickly to his bedside, Avith his usual noise less step. \" I am astonishingly better, and have slept beautifully. Have you attended to my request, my dear Paul ? \" \" Yes, Jean \u2014 I lost not a moment, so you may rest quite easy on that subject. Is there anything else that you wish done ?\" \" No thank you, my friend, except that you would leave me a moment with Dr. Bonnet. Parish business \u2014 you will forgive me for sending you away.\" \" Certainly.\" And thus saying, Paul Alost left the room. It might have been a quarter of an hour"], [309, "303 VERONIA. later that Dr. Bonnet joined him in the kitchen of the Presbytery. The Doctor looked more stern and sour than usual, and his voice was harsh, his accent bitter, as he spoke. \" Your friend, Monsieur Alost, is the most unmanageable, perverse, and every way wrong-headed patient Avith whom my long experience has ever brought me into contact. I am going back to the city now, and shall return here the very first thing to-morrow morning, as I am likely to be wanted, I think, unless you can induce Dr. Van Helder to keep himself calm, and avoid the dangerous state of excitement to which he is prone. Perhaps you had better go now, and use your influence in keeping him quiet, while I give your servant my instructions concerning him.\" \" My dear, good Paul,\" said the invalid, almost gaily, as the priest returned to his bedside, \" I am permitted to have some wine to-day \u2014 you will give me some of your very best.\" The Cure\" looked surprised. \" Are you sure, Jean, that you may take wine ? Dr. Bonnet has told me nothing of the kind.\""], [310, "304 VERONIA. \" No, to be sure, Paul ; how could you expect that man to be the bearer of any pleasant communication Avhatever ?

I really cannot permit any thing of the sort again until you are stronger, and if you attempt it I shall request Mademoiselle de Mehul to leave the room.\" \" No, my good Paul, you will let me have my way for this once, because it is a matter so very near my heart that I couldn't die happy, do you see, unless it was settled.

The latter looked away, as he replied, evasively \u2014 \" In those merely earthly interests you allude to, Paul, are involved the life-long happiness or misery of those I love.\" Whatever might have been the Cure's comment, it was silenced at this moment, by the fact of his attention being attracted by the sound of a footfall near him ; he turned, and saw that Bonnet had re-entered the chamber, having probably overheard the latter part of the conversation. \" I am returning to Bruges,\" said the austere disciple of Calvin, addressing the sick man Avith a cool defiance of the pastor's presence, \" and, as I know you are no Ro manist, Doctor Van Helder, if you would wish to see a minister of religion, I shall be happy to bring yo u one who is attached to our congregation \u2014 a man who preaches the vol in. x"], [312, "306 VERONIA. pure gospel, Christ's gospel, freed from the^ traditions of men.\" \"You are really too kind, Doctor Bonnet,\" said Van Helder, very blandly ; \" and I am greatly indebted to you for your obliging offer ; but, to be quite sincere, I must ac knowledge to you that the reverend gen tleman you mention might preach Mahomet triumphant for anything that his preaching could concern me. If by being no Romanist you mean that I am a Protestant, you are slightly in error; I could never think of paying so bad a compliment to the memory of the accomplished professor by the aid of Avhose instructions I acquired, when young, the first principles of logic. The attack of Protestantism upon Catholicity strongly resembles, as it seems to me, Don Quixote's attack upon the supposed giants; Avhile Christendom, like Sancho Panza, is vainly endeavouring to combat the mistake.\" Pale with anger at this comparison, the adherent of Reform stiffened his tall figure, while he sought a reply. When he spoke again his voice trembled. \" You then reject my proposal, Doctor Van Helder. In making it I have only fulfilled my duty as a Christian man, and I"], [313, "VERONIA. 307 again offer you the assistance of an uncor rupted minister, and a faithful servant of the gospel ; reflect a moment before reject ing it.\" \" It is unnecessary, Doctor Bonnet ; Ave have all, you knoAv, our idiosyncrasies ; Avhen the Church is angry, or offended, she storms ; I am disposed to like thunder, it suits my constitution ; but excuse me, I hate whining, and I really must decline to listen to it.\" \" I see, indeed, I was mistaken, monsieur, and I leave you in other hands,\" said Doctor Bonnet, uoav glancing furiously at the pastor, who had stood silent, and outwardly calm, but Avith a beating heart, opposite to him ; \" if I have taken a liberty,\" continued he, \" it was dictated by the respect I had enter tained for your judgment,\" and turning bitterly aAvay, the Calvinist left the sinner to his fate. As Bonnet left the chamber, the priest, pale, and now agitated, but with a tremulous hope shining in his eyes, turned toAvards Van Helder, and laying his hand on that of the latter, said impressively : \" Had you yielded to that man's persuasions, dear Jean, you Avould have broken my heart ! x2"], [314, "308 VERONIA. Twenty years have I prayed, waited for, watched over, and, until now, spared you on this subject even one impatient word ; shall all this have been in vain ? \" But touched by an appeal so simple, so loving, and from his friend's lips so rare, for once the sophist found neither voice nor words with which to urge objections, and taking advantage of his evident emotion, the priest continued \u2014 \" You have disclaimed any adherence to Protestantism ; tell me then, Jean, does any other creed possess in your mind a stronger claim to veneration than that of our Holy Church?\" \" No,\" was the unhesitating answer ; \" the Catholic idea, as I have before said, Paul, is too magnificent to find in my eyes any rival among meaner systems ; but between this philosophic admiration, and what is called Faith, there lies a gulf.\" \" True ; but your own will may throw a bridge across it, Jean ; if you love me, say : ' I do believe, Lord, help my unbelief.' \" And so, yielding to friendship, rather than to conviction, with moistened eyes and faltering accents, the recreant of so many years uttered his first prayer."], [315, "309 CHAPTER XXIII. The Arabs have a proverb Avhich signifies that the most distant event in futurity lies nearer to us than the transaction that happened an hour ago. Yet how often does an entire futurity take its colouring from that of the past hour !

Veronia had promised likewise to repress in him all undesirable symptoms of excite ment, and under these conditions had been permitted to take her accustomed station at his bedside for the purpose of listening as"], [316, "310 VERONIA. patiently as might be to the expression of his wishes.

Van Helder turned and regarded her at tentively for above a minute, and then sighed grievously. She looked up inquir ingly at him, though half dreading what might be his next words, and he replied to the look \u2014 \"During the last feAv days, when my strength failed me so terribly, my dear, and I was forced to keep silence, my thoughts were not the less active, believe me, and they chiefly concerned yourself.

To the happy this rule should perhaps apply less strictly, for the heart of man is desperately selfish, and often warps his moral sense ; but I had not such a temptation, for it was my destiny to be one of the unfortunate, and for this reason the happiness of others be came a passion with me ; if the happiness of strangers, how much more that of those like yourself, Veronia, whom I have loved. Will you listen patiently, therefore, to a few words from me ?\" \" Speak, my dear Doctor,\" said Veronia, \" with all my heart I Avill attend to you.\" \" Then, what I have to say is this. There is for woman but one great source of happi ness in life, and that one is the gratification of the affections. With us, it is said to be different, and, in truth, in a degree it is so ; but, unless we could dive into the secrets of men's hearts, it would be hard to say how far aught else can compensate for the sup pression of this one great instinct of human ity, or how many a man, whose sole aim has seemed to be the acquisition of this world's"], [321, "315 VERONIA. goods or honours, has not grasped at them to fill the void left in his own heart by the destruction of some tenderer hope. Instances of this, although more frequent among those endoAved with the poetic faculty than among others,' are still not wanting elsewhere. But for some more bitter disappointment than that which waits on merely worldly aspira tions, Avould Dante, Petrarch, and Byron have sung as they did ? Oh ! no. Grief Avas the vestal who kindled within them the sacred fire ; this was the secret of their transports, as it is often of the struggles and labours of less gifted men.\" He paused an instant, and Veronia, Avhose heart tremblingly presaged the object of his argument, was silent. Again he turned and looked at her atten tively, and Avhen he noticed her averted eyes, something of their former fire lit up his own. \" I cannot leave you thus unconvinced, Veronia ; and that nothing may be wanting to prove to you hoAv deeply I am in earnest noAV, you shall hear, my child, Avhat no liv ing ear has ever heard before \u2014 the history of my OAvn heart.\" Another pause,.then a convulsive sigh, as"], [322, "316 VERONIA. bitter as though born of some recent pain, struggled from the sick man's breast, with the unexpected Avords \u2014 \" I, too \u2014 the cynic, the jester, the oddity, as men think me \u2014 even I have known what it is to love !\" \" Oh ! my dear Doctor,\" cried Veronia, as she now turned, and, looking on his pale and suffering face, foresaAV the consequences of emotion to him, \"spare yourself; tell me nothing that can pain you, I entreat.\" \" It should be no pain, if time, as is pre tended, could obliterate,\" said he, with a sort of bitter contempt of hisownAveakness; \"yet, I confess that I have carried with me now for thirty years a wound which throbs as painfully Avhen my thoughts turn to it to-day, as if inflicted freshly.

You know, I doubt not, how I revolted, and impetuously chose for myself a path in life. In the first flush of man hood, I met her Avho was next to become the shadow of my life. \" She was fair, oh ! very fair \u2014 of that soft virgin beauty Avhich is man's ideal.

I see her still in memory \u2014 the cloudless tran sparency of morning on her broAv, the blue of deepest heaven in her eyes ! \u2014 its blue, and also its unpitying calm ! I have noticed through life that the pos sessors of such eyes are cruel \u2014 or, at least, of a nature incapable of much tenderness, if not too often, indeed, cold and severe to- Avards the weakness and the passion from which they are themselves exempt. It was so in her case. I had concentrated on her all the strength of my affections ere I learnt how hopeless was my love. She had, from early youth, devoted herself in in tention to the religious life; and when I spoke to her of my anguish at the discovery, she coldly stabbed me with the warning that, in a little while, such feelings would be sacrilege. By what mysterious and cruel fatality is"], [324, "318 VERONIA. it that ardent natures are so often fascinated and enthralled by cold and analytical ones ? \" Analytical, I say ; yes in the limpid un troubled glance she turned upon me Avhen I laid bare the quivering depths of my soul, I read a heartless curiosity, a mental interest in the dissection, but not one passing shade of sympathetic pain.

Too sharp, too bitter, was that draught to leave me the courage of ever seeking Avoman's We again.

Can you not feel the same for Henricart ? \" The word was spoken ; that word which Jacques Henricart had never dared, and, perhaps, now would never care to utter for himself.

There were days when the bright glance and flush of apparent health seemed to give the lie to Bonnet's ominous glances and shadowy prognostications ; yet again at moments when these symptoms disap peared, the sunken eyes and holloAv cheek told a tale of inward Avasting terrible to the hearts of those who Avatched and loved him, and one word which had fallen from Doctor Bonnet's lips, and was overheard by Veronia, explained in part the cause of his apprehen sions \u2014 that word was \" atrophy ! \""], [329, "323 VERONIA. Like many who by dint of watching the various stages of disease in those whose life they prize have become timid, she also had groAvn fearful of too closely inquiring into the case, and this mysterious word alarmed still more than it enlightened her. That day by day her friend was sinking sloAvly wasting to a shadow, she saAv too plainly \u2014 and it was true ; decline of a rapid and irre- mediable kind had seized upon him. Each morning early she took her way from the vicar's house, where she was remaining, to the Presbytery, from Avhich, notwithstanding his intolerance of its master's opinions, Doctor Bonnet would not permit Van Helder to be now removed ; so it seemed probable, that if the latter Avas really dying, his life Avould close Avithin its precincts. The damp of a November morning Avas rising heavily, as, about ten days after the conversation detailed in our last chapter, Veronia, having entered the garden gate, advanced along the pathway leading up to the kitchen door, Avhich was the usual entrance to the house.

Her first glance showed her two figures standing beside the bed, one was that of the Cure\\ the other turned at her entrance, and she recognized Jacques Henricart ! A look of deep grief overshadowed his countenance, such as in the darkest of his past days she had never seen there ; and one glance at the occupant of the bed ex plained it. Van Helder lay pale and silent upon his pillow, over his wasted features had stolen within the few hours since she had last"], [335, "329 \"VERONIA, looked on them an ominous and awful change. The eyelids resting now so heavily upon the eyes, as if death himself had pressed his seal upon them, the brow so wan and wasted, stained with heavy dew, the usually smiling lip now saddened as if for ever. As stealing softly to his side she noted all these signs, even the unexpected presence of Henricart was almost unheeded by her. The pastor bent towards her and whis pered something in her ear. \" There is no time to lose, my child ; if he becomes delirious again, his mind may remain too much clouded to receive a just impression. I have waited for your coming that you might introduce the subject less formally to him \u2014 will you try ?\" A gesture was the only answer. Veronia returned to the bed-side, and making a timid sign to Henricart to withdraw, she knelt down and laid her hand gently on that of the dying man ; at the expiration of an instant his eyes unclosed, and fixed themselves on her own. Veronia spoke, but it was in whispers, and as the priest, standing apart also, anxiously watched her listener, he observed the lip of the latter quiver"], [336, "330 VERONIA. slightly, while a motion of the head seemed to signify assent. The speaker had been mentioning to Van Helder Godensca's sacrifice and the pilgrim age she had procured on his behalf, and the recital had evidently touched him. Rising soon from beside his pillow, she left the chamber, and as Henricart and Paul Alost watched her silently, they felt that woman's tact might even at the supreme hour achieve what man dare not attempt. In another moment Mademoiselle de Mehul reappeared, followed by Godensca, and both approached Van Helder. \" My dear, dear Doctor, Godensca has a word for you which is of importance, if you can bear to hear it ; take this wine which I have brought you, it will give you strength,\" and thus saying Veronia held a glass to his lips, part of the contents of which he swalloAved slowly and with apparent diffi culty ; then, seemingly revived by it, he turned his eyes towards the afflicted hand maid, and said feebly and evidently by a great effort, \" What is it, Godensca ? You see that I shall never tease you any more ! Be kind when I am gone to Cauvin, for my sake,"], [337, "331 VERONIA. and never change his name \u2014 it would con fuse him so, poor dog \u2014 will you promise this, before I listen to you ? \" Godensca turned aAvay with a sob ; her heart Avas pierced and penitent at the thought of many a hard word and kick administered in the past to the now dying man's favourite, and it Avas Avith the fervour of a deep repentance that she ejaculated solemnly, \"Van Helder, 1 will,\" then, fall ing on her knees beside the bed, she con tinued in a paroxysm of excited feeling \u2014 \" And now, meinheer, listen to me, for I have a message for you \u2014 a message from tne holy saints themselves !

And then, at last, he died, but just before, he said to the first mariner who stood by him, that Avhen the 'Blessed Mary' came into port, the news of his death was to be carried to you the first thing ! \" and saying thus, the bearer of the message rose, and, as if in her opinion the communication was too sacred to bear the addition of another Avord from her, made the sign of the cross devoutly, and with dreAv.

What passed between the priest and the penitent in the solemn moments which suc ceeded, it is not for a profane pen to record ; too sacred and too aAvful is the theme ! Followed by Henricart, Veronia had bent her steps towards Godensca's domain, and there found her. The handmaiden Avas upon her knees before a homely picture, in an attitude ex pressive of all the energy of intensest faith and grievous sorrow ; and knoAving Avell for whom her prayers were offered, Veronia knelt beside her. Thus they remained above an hour, when the sound of a hurried foot-step aroused them, and rising, they confronted the Cure\\ who was in search of them. A glance at him was sufficient, and again the rough breast of Godensca heaved with a deep sob, as she clasped her hands in solemn thanksgiving."], [340, "334 VERONIA. \" Go quickly, my child,\" and the priest's trembling voice, and radiant though moist ened eyes too eloquently explained his meaning; \"and you, Mademoiselle de Mehul, come, and join your prayers with ours.\" And grouped around the dying bed of Van Helder, knelt soon all those Avho had so long mourned over, and prayed for him, yet iioav, though they marked the dark shadoAv stealing rapidly over his features, a deep and unearthly rejoicing filled their hearts. It shone in the tearful eyes of the pastor, as, bending down, he touched the dim eyes, the cold lips, and scarcely animate limbs Avith the unction of the dying, breathed over him the words of faith, and was echoed in the responses of those who assisted by their presence to comfort the traveller now entering the valley of death. The rite was over ; the assistant priest and acolytes had withdrawn, but on a table near the bed still stood the crucifix and candles of the altar, which had been hastilv erected, for the newly reconciled one was passing rapidly away, his moments were counted. He cast around him on the de voted group a last look of farewell, which"], [341, "VERONIA. 335 settled finally upon the face of his old friend. Paul Alost met with a smile the dying look thus fixed upon him, as with one hand he pointed upwards, and with the other took the now icy one of Van Helder, and for a moment these two hearts, so long dh'ided in their aspirations, beat in har mony, united by the same ineffable thought, and hope of a glorious re-union ; for the angel of peace stood beside them, and it was the echo of his message that fell from the lips of the dying Christian, in a last faint whisper \u2014 \" All is well ! \""], [342, "336 CHAPTER XXV.

On that chill November morning, when the reconciled soul of Van Helder was pass ing from earth, lay crushed and vanquished that of the hitherto most triumphant cha. racter of our story. In the large, old fashioned bed-chamber, where we have once described him as bending in such intense self-pity over the image of his own cherished person in the glass, we again find Adrian de Boisvante. The case was closed, the fiat had gone forth, and the sad, early light now stealing in, seemed resting, almost pitying, upon the pale brow of the husband elect of Jus tine Bouchard ! Night had rolled over his sleepless head since, on the previous evening, in her father's office, he had learnt his doom \u2014 the price at which alone the dreadful secret of his birth \u2014 secure, indeed, in the honour of all those who possessed it, save that of the Bouchards \u2014 as well as the enjoyment of the Duke's fortune, could be preserved. That price was the acceptance of the lawyer's daughter I Haggard and ghastly, almost in the same vol. in. z"], [344, "338 VERONIA. posture of utter despair in which he had sank down the previous night, on retiring to his chamber, the young man now lay stretched across the couch on which he had thrown his Aveary limbs. Night \u2014 with its long hours of agonizing thoughts and struggles \u2014 had retired before the cold grey ones of daAvn, Avhich bring a numb forgetfulness even to the most tortured spirit, and, where they too had lengthened into the gloom of a November morning, the victim aAvoke again to the dreadful reality of his position. He sat up and con templated woefully the ghastly reflection of himself, that stared at him from the long mirror which had once given back so differ ent an image. Where were now the pride, the glory, and the grace of manhood of but twelve hours ago? Wan and blighted, like the future which spread out before his mental vision. On both had a shadow fallen, which never would pass thence, and, like the wretch whose hours are counted, and who hears outside the strokes Avhich accompany the erection of his scaffold, as he caught the first sounds of aAvakening movement in what was now indeed his prison house, the"], [345, "VERONIA. 339 thought of past, present, and future surged up within his fevered brain. Frenzied and desperate he sprang up. What could fate have in store for him Avorse than this, should it be even death \u2014 death by his own hand ? But no ! the coward shrank and shivered at the thought of that pang ! Come misery, come shame, he must live on ; to die, appalled him, and at that instant a step sounded on the stair, a voice applied for entrance at his chamber door. He heard again, in fancy, that dreadful laughter with which, the night before, Bou chard, in his own office, had greeted his refusal to accede to the proposed terms, and again rang in his ears the dreadful words, \" Bastard! do you choose rather that! \" \" No ! oh ! no ; anything or everything besides,\" and with a gesture almost like madness, he met the smiling bearer of the summons to sign his marriage contract below. And there we leave him. Surely the reader will think Avith us that Veronia was not ill avenged !"], [346, "340 CONCLUSION. Winter came sadly down upon the inhabit ants of St. Andrew's, plunged as they were in mourning that their friend, their stay, their Doctor, was no more ! \" To have died too,\" as Godensca said, \"just as he had learnt how to live ! \" Ah ! it was sad indeed ! but when these lamentations reached their Pastor, he gently rebuked them, saying, \" Remember, my children, that our loss is his eternal gain,\" and the murmurs then for a while ceased \u2014 all of them, at least, but those of Camdn, to whom this source of con solation was unknown ! And yet the Cure's words applied exactly also to his case, for the loss sustained by the parishioners turned greatly to the favourite's advantage, Van Helder's death having conduced wonderfully to change the"], [347, "341 VERONIA. favourite's destiny ! Pains and privations had vanished from his life, to be replaced by kindness and plenty \u2014 for Godensca had been faithful to her promise \u2014 and had he been a human being, Cauvin might, by weighing these against his deprivation of a friend, have found in them some compensa tion ; but being only a dog, his poor faithful heart Avas not wise enough to accept any substitute for the lost object of its affections ! Over the hamlet then hung gloom and sorrow, and yet one oasis of brightness lay hidden in it, where two tried hearts had learnt at length to understand each other. It was evening, in the Cure's sanctum, and the gloAv of firelight from its hearth fell brightly upon two persons whom the priest had just quitted, for the purpose of communicating to Godensca a confession which he had just received from them, and an event it presaged, Avhich \u2014 notAvithstand ing her OAvn deficiencies in respect to the matrimonial vocation \u2014 would, he Avellknew, be received by her with the interest that her sex never fail to take in the subject. As the door closed, Henricart turned to his companion. \"Ah! Veronia,\" said he, \"hoAV Avell I"], [348, "342 VERONIA. recognise the greatness, the true nobility of your nature ; all poor and undeserving as I am, you accept me unconditionally ; you do not say, ' Go, make yourself worthy of me, raise yourself to my level, and become my equal.' \" \" My equal, Henricart ! \" answered she tenderly ; \" when once a woman's love is given, he who has won from her this dis tinction, needs no other in her eyes. The law of nature, and that of God, have thus constituted him her superior; for whom can she feel greater reverence than for the master of her destiny ? \" She smiled, and yielded to him the hand so long withheld, so hardly won, and in that smile and gesture was conveyed all that language, the warmest, truest, and most eloquent, is too faint, poor, and powerless to express !

THE THIRTY-SECOND EDITION FOR 1863 IS NOW READY. Lodge s Peerage and Baronetage ia acknowledged to be the most complete, as well as the most elegant, work of the kind. As an esta blished and authentic authority on all questions respecting the family histories, honours, and connections of the titled aristocracy, no work has ever stood so high. It is published under the especial patronage of Her Majesty, and is \u2022 annually corrected throughout, from the personal com munications of the Nobility. It is the only work of its class in which, the. type being kept constantly standing, every correction is made in its proper place to the date of publication, an advantage which gives it supremacy over all its competitors. Independently of its full and authentic informa tion respecting the existing Peers and Baronets of the realm, the most sedulous attention is given in its pages to the collateral hranches of the various noble families, and the names of many thousand individuals are introduced, which do not appear in other records of the titled classes. For its authority, correctness, and facility of arrangement, and the beauty of its typography and binding, the work is justly entitled to the place it occupies on the tahles of Her Majesty and the Nobility.
