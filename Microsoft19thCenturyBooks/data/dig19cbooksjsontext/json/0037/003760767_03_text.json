B"], [14, "THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE 2 I took her to a quiet, respectable hotel between Pall Mall and Piccadilly; then got a long, long sleep, and awoke full of vigour and resolution. Some orderly hand had been arranging everything in the chaos of my brain. I knew now what I had to do, and determined to lose no time in doing it. Firstly, then, I had to dress with unwonted care, for I was going to call upon a lady whom I was very desirous to please. I stopped in the street to buy a chrysanthe mum for my button-hole, and smiled as I thought of the astonished eyes of Aileen. For it was towards Clapham that I journeyed \u2014 at Clapham that I finally landed, my face flushing, my heart beating high with expectation. At last I stood before a tiny house, dis tinguishable amongst its neighbours by the almost audacious masculinity of its appear-"], [15, "A SMALL HOUSE AT CLAPHAM 3 ance. For on its front was a brass plate, on which were inscribed these words : GERALD MALCOLMSON, Aechitect. My first knock was unanswered. I knocked again a good deal louder \u2014 a regular rat-a-tat-tat. I soon became sensible to my finger-tips \u2014 informed thereof by that sense within us as yet undignified by a name \u2014 that this un wonted summons had caused more than one neighbouring curtain to be hastily drawn aside, and brought more than one pair of feminine eyes to be inquisitively fixed upon the stranger. Then I heard the sound of approaching feet. The colour rose to my cheek, and I began to tremble. How is it that we are so awkward and embarrassed when we meet friends after long separation ? It may be that a crowd of B 2"], [16, "THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE 4 strangers could not discompose us, but one familiar eye can do it easily. But it was not Aileen who opened the door, keeping it cautiously on the chain. It was a stranger. I inquired for Mrs. Malcolmson\u2014 giving Aileen her married name with a singular sense of how far it took her from me. ' Missus was out.' I inquired further, with a sinking, yet. somehow, relieved heart for Mr. Malcolm son. ' Master too was out.' At this crisis, with somewhat embarrassed impetuosity, I interposed a hand to prevent the door being unceremoniously closed in my face. The woman inside, no whit embar rassed, contemplated that hand with uncon cealed suspicion, and appeared to wonder whether the law would justify her in squash- ing it."], [17, "A SMALL HOUSE AT CLAPHAM 5 Could she tell me where they were to be found ? Questioned one didn't know. Or when they would return ? Questioned one didn't know that either. My anger rose. My voice too rose a trifle with it as I said, 'I am a relative of Mrs. Malcolmson's. Open the door.' Now, a decided command has this remark able quahty : it contains within itself both cause and effect. Speak as if disobedience were an impossibility, and I'll stake my head you will be obeyed. The woman drew back the chain sullenly enough and opened the door. I entered. To the right hand of the Lilliputian passage, from which arose a flight of stairs, steep and straight as a ladder, was a door, slightly ajar. ' I will wait for your mistress,' I said again to the maid with the same decisive peremptoriness ; ' in the meantime go"], [18, "THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE 6 about your business. I need not detain you. As I spoke, I pushed the door further open, and went boldly into the room whose entrance it guarded. It already contained two living occupants, both faintly visible by the feeble ray of a solitary lamp which, half concealed under a green shade, stood upon a round table \u2014 the centre-piece of the tiny room ; both also re vealing their presence by certain soitnds. A canary warbled a low song in the twilight obscurity ; a human being gave slow utterance to the deep, regular breathing of profound est sleep. My audacity in thus forcing an entrance was getting punished already. Good heavens ! what if I had got into the wrong house ! The maid was gone. I was left at my own command, to my own resources \u2014 an unhallowed intruder into a sanctuary !"], [19, "A SMALL HOUSE AT CLAPHAM 7 I slightly shifted the shade over the lamp, letting its rays fall full upon the face of the sleeper. It was that of an old lady, sunk low in an easy chair drawn up before the dying embers on the hearth. Her hands lay loosely folded upon the knitting on her lap (not the grey stocking of Switzerland, but something soft and fleecy, ivory-white and rosy red), the monoto nous colour of her dark grey gown agree ably relieved by a snow-white apron, equally snowy muslin collar, and high-crowned Quaker looking cap. Now old age, as a rule, is no beautifier. It dims the eye, sallows and wrinkles the once smooth skin, robs the bright hair of its gloss. Old age, too, man-hke, is harder on women than on men. But it was God who had beautified the placid face before me. Nature \u2014 that wayward sculptress \u2014 had chiselled the features care-"], [20, "THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE 8 lessly ; the upper lip too long, the nose too short, the chin a trifle too massive. But love, and pureness of heart, and patient longsuffer- ing, had made the face so beautiful, that it looked almost holy as it lay there upon the pillow in the calm unconsciousness of sleep. The eyes had shed many tears \u2014 witness the deep rills which marked the course of their currents. Yet every line bore emphatic testi- mony to the beauty of the soul. The hand of relentless Old Age had faltered on approach- ing this woman ; only with his lips had he touched her, and that like a lover, bright- ening the bloom upon her soft cheek with his kisses. I looked and looked again, ravished, and could not choose but look. In my ears ranc the echo of a long-forgotten lullaby. Upon my cheek burned kisses, like none that I had felt for years. Before my mental eyes rose a spiritual presence. Memory stirred within"], [21, "A SMALL HOUSE AT CLAPHAM 9 me, striking long untouched chords upon my heart, the deep vibrations of which shook me to my centre. I went nearer. I knelt down before the sleeper. I examined her lineaments with the keenest anxiety. The hair, rebelling against the restraint of the cap, fell over the low, broad brow in well-remembered ripples. The wrinkled hands, softly sunk in the rosy web upon her knee, were like \u2014 oh, Heaven ! \u2014 so like others, the firmest, the tenderest I had ever known. And \u2014 good God ! \u2014 a drowsy bluebottle hummed in the high crown of her venerable head-covering. At this final discovery, Memory, in agi tated haste, poured a strong acid over words almost obliterated. Clear, black, distinct they stood out before me : ' Let the cruel thing that weaned a brother from a sister answer that.' I burst out into loud sobbing. I threw"], [22, "THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE 10 my arms round my dear, dear old nurse. I laid my head upon the bosom that had been my childhood's only and unfailing solace. I thanked God for His boundless mercy. He had taken my friend \u2014 my heart's father \u2014 from me ; had given me instead my soul's mother once more. ' My dearest Charley, I don't like to mar our almost perfect happiness by scolding you, but a good housewife always has one eye on duty, and I really must, you know.' Thus, an hour later, Aileen. Scene : a dining-room, five feet by four. That is to say, on consideration, it must be a trifle larger, but it really does not look so. Talk about cats, you couldn't swing a kitten in that room, unless it were a Manx one, with out imminent danger to that kitten's brains. How a table has been got into it / don't know \u2014 perhaps by the same process that the"], [23, "A SMALL HOUSE AT CLAPHAM 11 apple gets into the dumpling. How a sofa \u2014 so fragile-looking that I wouldn't sit upon it for worlds \u2014 and various chairs got there is for me an impenetrable mystery. Perhaps the ceiling is movable, and they were let down. I look up at said ceiling with some alarm as this thought suggests itself, especially as an elephant is promenading above us. I don't know how he got there either, but feel sure it must be an elephant, until Aileen, laughing a little, says it is Margery. Third matter for contemplation : how did we four average-sized human beings get into, and how do we manage to live in, this room ? I am, it is true, occasionally sensible of a con striction in the throat resembling suffocation, but I do not think it is from want of air. I suppose, too, I came in at the door, though now, looking back at it, it seems a physical impossibility. I might be anxious concerning my exit, only that as yet I have not the"], [24, "THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE 12 smallest desire to go. Yet this Euclidical problem \u2014 a very Asses' Bridge of difficulty \u2014 does occur to me : if the door was the tightest of fits before, what will it be after, tea? For I am sitting at Aileen's board for the first time ; my legs very quiet under the table, and also under strict injunctions not to move with any degree of abruptness. A general overturn, it is evident, would be the result of disobedience. Aileen is at the head of this table, pouring out tea. Aileen's husband is at its foot, cutting up bread. I have Aileen's authority for asserting that he is his house's master and hers. I have the authority of my own observations and power of combination for asserting with at least equal tenacity that upon his neck is the foot of a little mistress.

I defy any learned professor of the British Association, though he be immersed in electricity and all the rest of it to his learned ears, to find me a greater. Opposite me, on the above-mentioned sofa, sits my nurse, her face, hke mine, bright with smiles \u2014 smiles so replete with emotion that at any moment they may return to their primeval source and become tears again. ' I really must, you know,' says Aileen. 'Go ahead, Aileen,' encourages her hus band, as she pauses to shake her lovely little head at me ; during which by no means alarm ing performance, her curls, now confined with a matronly comb, tumble in a golden shower about her. ' He won't mind it. H he's hke me, he'll rather like it.' 'Like it, sir? \u2014 Take some toast, nursey darling. I made it myself \u2014 soft for your poor old teeth.

' What, sir ! do you mean to tell me I'm getting fat ?

This terrible commercial perplexity bring ing a faint shadow on Aileen's smooth young brow, I seek to disperse it. ' When am I to get the scolding, little sister ? I can't enjoy my tea till it is over.' ' Ah, you don't expect to like it, then ! That is right. When I scold people I want them to mind it ; to be hurt by it ; to dread it ; to tremble in expectation of it.' ' By Jove ! it must be something awful.' ' So it is. \u2014 You may laugh, Gerald, but I read once in one of mamma's novels of the \" hollow laugh of terror and despair \" ! ' ' Goodness ! ' ' No, sir, badness. Atrociousness. What do you mean by breaking into our house like a midnight thief, without so much as a note"], [28, "16 THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE or a telegram beforehand to put us on our guard ? ' ' 'Twas a long way from midnight, Aileen,' I venture timidly to observe. (It is odd how completely Aileen's marriage has turned the tables against me. I wouldn't venture to hector her now for anything, but it seems she may venture to hector me, and pretty smartly too.) ' Stick to the point, sir, if you can. Gerald can't. Just the tiniest little slip of a false word, and down he pounces on it, as if it were the gist of the whole matter. Pray, must a thief come exactly when the clock strikes twelve to be a midnight one ? ' ' No, Aileen, but. ' No buts, sir \u2014 like a midnight thief, I say, frightening Margery to that degree that she shook after it (she told me so) hke a \" hasping leaf.\" I'm not botanist enough,' continues Aileen, looking at her rosy finger-tips reflec-"], [29, "A SMALL HOUSE AT CLAPHAM 17 tively, ' to know precisely what sort of leaf that is, but anyhow, I'm sure it must be one that shakes terribly.' We laugh so uproariously at this, that I am sure we must have alarmed the neighbours. I haven't laughed hke that for months, al most years ; but this happy, joyous home is doing me all the good in the world. Aileen's rosebud of a mouth protrudes itself into an unmistakable pout. ' I dare say it's very natural for a man to make game of his wife's ignorance,' she says, pretending to be vexed ; ' but seeing he took her for better and worse, and knew what a silly girl she was beforehand \u2014 and I'm sure she never pretended to know anything \u2014 I think 'twould be more manly and more gener ous to stick up for her.'

A much worse one. \u2014 Nursey dear, don't look at me like that. I mean to scold him. He deserves no mercy. I'm sure he nearly frightened you to death.' ' He didn't frighten me a bit,' answers my nurse, smiling faintly. ' I had been dreaming of them both \u2014 my long-lost boys. And then"], [31, "A SMALL HOUSE AT CLAPHAM 19 I seemed to see them both\u2014 so much alike, and yet so different. Ah ! will he ever come back to me ? ' My nurse's voice has sunk into the monoto nous tone of soliloquy, and from her eyes, directed downwards, one or two drops fall heavily. I look at Aileen, anxious and amazed. Aileen looks back at me and slightly shakes her curly head again, a rosy finger on her rosy Lips. ' Nevertheless, dear,' she continues, ' though, fortunately as far as we can see yet, no very serious result is to be apprehended, it was quite enough to frighten her into fits. I don't approve of servants hstening behind doors or peeping through keyholes as a rule, but I can not scold Margery under the circumstances, for keeping the house door open, her heart in her mouth and her eye at the keyhole, all the time you were there. \" Which, mem,\" she said (she calls me mem, Charley, and is really c 2"], [32, "THROUGH LOVE TO LIFE 20 a most invaluable servant, and such a cook, but not quite a Lindley Murray) \u2014 \" which, mem, when I see him down upon his knees afore her, and she sleeping like a babby, I were that mortal certing that he was either a roaring madlam or a-going to wilful murder her, that I should have screeched myself mad too, only that the strength were took out of me in spasms.\" ' Aileen offering no explanation of this ex traordinary speech, I think Margery must have got confused between madman and Bedlam.

' Not now. Some time, perhaps, Aileen.' ' I've seen it in you all the evening, but I couldn't speak until we were alone. You went away a bonny boy \u2014 you have come home a bonnier man, my brother. Your smile is different. Your eyes have learned to weep.' As she raises her own blue eyes and chattering little mouth to mine, I see a great change in her too \u2014 the bud of promise ex panded into a sweeter flower than I had ever anticipated. Our lips meet again as they never met before. Malcolmson is a fellow of sense, he hngers stiU behind us ; while we, under cover of the solitude and passage twi light, indulge in the warmest of fraternal hugs. We are again seated in the Lilliputian drawing-room.

A silver thimble flashes brightly hither and thither in the combined light of lamp and fire ; a steel needle accompanies it. She is making something too small, and fine, and flimsy to be intended as a garment for herself or her husband, or certainly for Margery. Perhaps it is a pocket handkerchief, but I hardly think so. I vaguely wonder what it is, as I sit watching her sweet, now grave, little face, upon which the flickering firelight throws strange lights and shadows. o Do She is greatly changed. I see it plainly now. A new earnestness on her brow, a new light in her eye, a new tenderness in her smile ; the girlish gleefulness tempered by the wife's gracious dignity.

It is not a tear of sadness \u2014 the proud, the tender smile"], [37, "A SMALL HOUSE AT CLAPHAM 25 trembling round her pure young lips destroys all fear of that. The sweet perfume of the opened floweret thrills my soul with gladness, and also with a passionate yearning.

It seems to take a shape familiar to me. I am sure I have seen her knitting things of hke fashion in the old dismal nursery. Vaguely, stiU talking, I wonder for whom they are intended.

' Well, my pet ? ' ' Our home is but a little one ; a very, very little one.' ' Has it grown too small for you, Aileen ? ' ' No, no, no !

' Specially in a city where the sun never shines,' he says, smiling. ' Go on, my wife.' ' Husband dear, 1 never asked you for anything yet that you said no to.' ' Which is an intimation that I must not say no now. Go on, my darling.' ' Gerald dear, while I was sitting there sewing, listening to Charley and to my own fancies too ' ' What, a tear !

He used to let her sit at his knee, and sometimes would stroke her cheek with a kind of loving tenderness that he had never before shown to any one. At such moments my heart would come into my mouth, and hot tears into my eyes, and the ground would seem to shake under me.
