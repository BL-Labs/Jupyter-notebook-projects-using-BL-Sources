The fatal accident occurred in the early morning of Tuesday the 1st of October. After several hours of entire unconsciousness, the sufferer expired at 20 minutes after 4 o'clock the same afternoon. The funeral took place on the Friday of the same week : it was attended by a vast but orderly concourse, the shops being shut, and business suspended, not only in the"], [7, "i P BE FACE. great thoroughfares, but in the most remote parts of the Town. On the following Sunday the Corporation at tended Divine Service in the Parish Church, which was filled by a serious and mourning Congregation. On the return of the Town Council to the Mansion- House, a Resolution was unanimously passed, requesting the publication of the Sermon, and de siring that it might be printed, at the expense of the Corporation, for the benefit of the funds of the Don caster Infirmary. These circumstances may, it is hoped, account for the appearance of a Discourse which was prepared without any such intention, and which possesses no claim to a wider circu lation."], [8, "PBEFACE. 5 It is respectfully dedicated to that important and powerful Municipal Body, by whose kindness, and at whose cost, it is given to the public ; in the hope that it may be the means, under God, of fixing in the hearts of its readers some of those lessons of Divine admonition which our re cent sorrows have been designed to convey.

And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me ; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein: And He spread it before me : and it was written within and without: and there was written therein lamentations and mourning and woe. There can scarcely be more discon solate words. And the position of the Prophet corresponded with them. He was a captive, and an exile. A Priest of God by birth, education, and profession, he had personally shared in the gathering calamities of his peo ple ; and in one of those deportations by which Babylon prepared the way"], [11, "THE HAND AND THE SCBOLL. 8 for the utter desolation and destruc tion of Israel, he was himself carried away into the heart of the giant Empire, to a place called Tel-abib, on the banks of a river called Chebar, and there he was among the cap tives, entering with the very soul into all the strangeness and dulness and loneliness of their forlorn and for saken life. For many months, for more than four years, the young Priest was left in that solitariness among a multi tude. Robbed of his Temple, and with it of all that employed and interested his life; thrown amongst uncongenial and discontented companions, whose frivolity and infidelity must have been the perpetual cross and torment of his exile ; it is difficult to imagine a situ ation more trying to the spirits, or more unfavourable (humanly speaking) to the welfare of the soul. The trial was borne; bravely, and atlastwith blessing."], [12, "THE HAND AND THE SCBOLL. 9 We cannot doubt that he often with drew himself to a distance from his comrades, and there perhaps realized much that had heretofore been a name to him, concerning the reality and concerning the presence of God. At last, faith and patience received their promised recompence of reward. The heavens were opened, such is his own simple and solemn record, and I saw visions of God. The ivord of the Lord came expressly unto Ezelricl the priest. ..in the land of the Chaldeans, by the river Chebar: and the hand of the Lord was there upon him. Mark the terms. Visions, that is, sights, of God. The word of the Lord. The hand of the Lord. These three. A man who has these \u2014 May be left\u2014but not alone. This is the introduction of the mysterious but most instructive Book, of which a little, too little, is read in 1\u20145"], [13, "THE HAND AND THE SCBOLL. 10 the Church during three Sundays in the year, of which this is the first. It is no easy matter \u2014 nor shall I now attempt \u2014 to explain the vision of the first Chapter. Whirlwind, cloud, and fire, are the opening signals of the Divine presence. Next, from the very heart of the fire there come forth four living creatures, the counterparts of the Cherubim in the Tabernacle and Temple ; representatives of God's creation in its chief forms of animal life; symbols, I think we may say, of God's control over, and action in, His creatures; all moved by the impulse of His Providence, all quickened by the pervading energy of His Spirit. It was designed as the consolation of the Prophet in his remote and ap parently Godless exile; assuring him that he could go nowhere out of the sphere of God's operation, out of the reach of God's protection. Even in the land of the shadow of death, the"], [14, "THE HAND AND THE SCBOLL. 11 region of superstition and idolatry and brute-worship, Nature still serves God, and God is at work still in Nature. Nor is this all. Over the heads of these living creatures there is the likeness of a sapphire throne; and upon the likeness of the throne there is the likeness as the appearance of a Man above upon it. Not only is God at work in Nature ; He is also a living personal God : and when the heart of man would rise upwards to Him, it finds there the heart of a Man; of One who can be touched ivith the feelmg of our infirmities, and is able to succour them that are tempted. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord: and when I saw it, L fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of One that spiake. The Priest has become the Pro phet. It was not always so. A man might minister in the temple-courts \u2014 a man might even enter, as the High"], [15, "12 THE HAND AJVD THE SCBOLL. Priest, once a year, the innermost shrine of all, the Holy of Holies\u2014 and yet never receive upon his soul the impress of God's presence. And that last is what makes a man a Prophet. It is the being able to say with the Patriarch, / have heard of Thee with the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth Thee. Ezekiel had this gift now \u2014 and where? Not in pleasant, attractive, soothing circumstances; not in his daily ministrations as a Priest; not in the society of believing friends, or in the honoured useful occupations of public, of social, of domestic life. These, for him, were ended. He was unhappy, he was exiled, he was idle, he was useless. That is his discipline; mysterious, but effective. He accepts it. It is the will of God. The popu lar dignities of the Priest are thus being exchanged for the repulsive eccentricities of the Prophet. A man can scarce be both at once. Now the"], [16, "THE HAND AND THE SCBOLL. 13 heavens are opened, and he has seen the vision of God. Next, he is to hear a voice. He is lying prostrate before the revelation of God's glory. But that posture, though becoming to the man, is un suitable to the Prophet. He who would carry a message must be equip ped for motion. Son of Man \u2014 that title by which the desolate exile, a Priest no longer, could still be ac costed; that title which belongs in a sense to every man, even when he has ceased to be an Israelite, and ceased to have a temple; that title which makes the ivhole world kin, and re minds him who bears it that he is the Apostle not of one nation but of all mankind; that title, last and above all, which was taken for His own, and almost for the same reason, by One greater than the Prophets \u2014 Son of Man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee."], [17, "14 THE HAND AND THE SCBOLL. And first concerning the persons to whom God will send him. They are not men predisposed to hearken. It is pleasant to address a friendly, a listening, an admiring audience. Human nature can do that. That wants no Prophet. The Prophet's au dience are transgressors and rebels, impudent and stiff-hearted \u2014 hard of face, the Hebrew calls them, and hard of heart \u2014 and it is a question, and more than a question, whether they will hear, or whether they tvill forbear. None the less, they must be spoken to. The Prophet must not fear them : to live amongst them may be like moving among briars; their touch and their converse may be like the sting of scorpions: still be not cts raid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks: the more they set themselves against it, the more do they want the truth: he who would show himself worthy to carry God's message must"], [18, "THE HAND AND THE SCBOLL. 15 show himself unmoved by man's taunts, undismayed by man's revilings. And even before all this there is yet one preliminary. Before the Pro phet can speak, he must hear. Before he utters the word, he must have even eaten it. The first call is, Open thy mouth, and eat that L give thee. And when he looks, behold, in his vision, there is a hand sent to him, and in the hand a scroll of written parch ment ; written on front and back, so copious and overflowing is the revela tion : and of what character? joyous, or grievous? praise, or reproof? pro mise, or threatening? there was written therein \u2014 or rather, thereon, as the very inscription and title of the whole \u2014 Lamentations, and mourning, and woe. The book of Ezekiel's prophecy is entitled, like another book of Holy Scripture, A Book of Lamentations. The Prophet disobeys not. In his vision, he opens his mouth, and eats"], [19, "16 THE HAND AND THE SCBOLL. the scroll. He is to make God's word (to be spoken by his lips) a part of himself. He is to swallow, and he is to digest. It is the Avant of this, my brethren, which oftentimes makes our word so lifeless. The prophet would speak God's Word, but he has not eaten it. It comes not from within him. He may hold it in his hand, in the book or in the manuscript, but he has it not first in the heart and in the soul. Let us think of this, all of us who would teach ! We must take in the truth ourselves \u2014 we must masticate, we must swallow, we must digest \u2014 then at last we can speak it ! Notice too, although the book is a book of Lamentations, yet, as soon as the Prophet eats it, it is in his mouth as honey for sweetness. What! is he cold and unfeeling as to the denunciation of judgment? Is he careless who sins and who suffers \u2014 who offends God, and incurs God's"], [20, "THE HAND AND THE SCBOLL. 17 judgment? Not so. The feeling de scribed is most unlike this. Ezekiel had a tender heart for the sorrows of his people, a compassionate heart even for the infirmities of the weak and the backslidings of the sinful. But this is true ; that, whether in itself stern or comforting, the very savour and taste of God's Word is always sweet, always delightful, to the man who loves Him. Even the page most full of severity is full also of good ness: in the midst of judgment He remembers mercy, and has no plea sure in the death of him that dieth. Then did I eat it \u2014 the scroll of lamen tation, the scroll of God's judgment\u2014 and it ivas in my mouth as honey for sweetness. It has pleased God, my brethren, to send us of this place a hand of chastisement; not a roll of a book, containing a catalogue of threatened"], [21, "THE HAND AND THE SCBOLL. 18 judgments, but rather a series of ac tual visitations, falling, with calamitous weight, and in quick succession, upon the homes and families of our people. We cannot look round this Congre gation, and not see on every side re cent traces of mourning and bereave ment. In particular, the hand of death has been busy amongst the men of our people ; the active, the vigorous, the prominent men; the men who were conducting the business, bearing the responsibility, and enjoying the chief honour, of our municipal commu nity. During the last fifteen months, we have had cause again and again to make sorrowful application to our selves of that gloomy saying of the Psalmist, He sleio the ivealthiest of them, yea, and smote down the chosen men that were in Israel. Scarcely have we recovered from the depress ing influence of the latest of these sorrows, when another blow falls, un-"], [22, "THE HAND AND THE SCBOLL. 19 exampled (I believe) for very nearly a century \u2014 in some of its circumstances altogether unprecedented \u2014 in the an nals of this Town. Last Sunday, the foremost place in the Congregation was occupied by one who was dis charging, with all efficiency and ho nour, the manifold duties lying upon the chief magistracy of the Borough : to-day he is not \u2014 he is in his grave. The startling suddenness of the call has made it audible far beyond the limits of our own little circle ; upon the town itself it fell, but five days ago, like a thunderbolt. It is not my office, here or anywhere, to pro nounce a flattering eulogium upon the departed. Let us never forget here that we are in God's House, in God's presence. If in a certain sense, though for an opposite reason, even God's praise is, as the Psalmist tells us, silent in Sion, how much more the praise of man ! It is not often that an example"], [23, "THE HAND AND THE SCBOLL. 20 of saintly virtue can be brought for ward, with truth, from the present ex perience osman : anything short of this would be entirely ont of place, where God dwells and man worships. My purpose in making any refer ence to-day to the mournful records of the year, and especially of the week, that is past, is different, wholly dif ferent, from the exaltation, in this place, of human merit. Elsewhere I might dwell with thankfulness upon the memory of a diligent, an amiable, au honourable career; upon public duties conscientiously fulfilled, do mestic affections tenderly cherished, offices of kindness to the necessitous cheerfully rendered: \u2014 elsewhere, but not here. I have chosen for notice here just that aspect of the event, which the Church Services, by a coin cidence in which we may almost trace a providence, have suggested to us in the Lesson for the day. I think that"], [24, "THE HAND AND THE SCBOLL. 21 it is impossible for us, if we would be true, not to recognize something awful, something alarming, something (I had almost said) judicial, in God's late dealings with us as a Town. We can scarcely fail to say that, if indeed there be such a thing as a hand in these matters, and if that hand has in it any roll of a book, any design or meaning as to the lessons which God would con vey, then the label upon that book \u2014 upon its face and upon its back \u2014 is something not far different from the superscription of Ezekiel's Prophecy\u2014 there was inscribed thereupon \u2014 it was the title of the book \u2014 Lamentations and mourning and woe. But we shall not forget, in so say ing, three great maxims of Divine wisdom in the interpretation of what we call Providences. First, we must never infer from in dividual calamity individual sin. We are expressly warned \u2014 and we would"], [25, "THE HAND AND THE SCBOLL. 22 thank the Divine Master for it \u2014 not to say, Because the blood of these Galileans ivas mingled by Pilate with their sacri fices \u2014 because the tower of Siloam fell upon those ten men and slew them \u2014 therefore they ivere sinners above all the Galileans \u2014 sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem. Whatever the purpose of a distressing provi- dence be, it is never this. It never comes to flatter the self-ignorance of the living, and it never comes to en- courage uncharitableness and censo- riousness in judging the dead. Except ye repent \u2014 this is the lesson of all such visitations \u2014 ye shall all likewise perish. Nor again, is it our business to declare authoritatively, even with re gard to public acts and measures, that this or that has called down upon us God's displeasure. It might seem to some persons a just and easy thing to say, God has a controversy with us"], [26, "THE HAND AND THE SCBOLL. 23 concerning this or that expenditure of our public money, this or that collec tive neglect of the higher or the high est interests of one class or another class of our citizens, and therefore He smites down one after another of our leading public men as a warning to the body and to the town. This too is presumption. This is interpreting where God has not spoken: this is limiting the counsels of the Holy One of Israel. And yet once more, we must re member, that punishment is never God's end in chastening : that, where He wounds, He wounds but to heal ; and where He threatens, corrects, or smites, there is always hidden in the chastisement this gracious purpose \u2014 that all, we all, we individually, may come to repentance. The truest lessons of our mourning are also the plainest and the most obvious. Let us lay them to heart,"], [27, "2*4 THE HAND AND THE SCBOLL. each and all! It will suffice but to name them. 1. There is, first, the simple moral of a sudden death. Few men, I believe, really antici pate a sudden end for themselves. All profess to think it* possible \u2014 in general terms, not improbable \u2014 that death may overtake them as a thief in the night. But it is not usual \u2014 per haps it is not desirable \u2014 to live in the momentary expectation of what, after all, often as it may happen, is an ex ceptional thing. It is natural to us to account it as more probable that we shall live out our threescore years and ten. It is not the expectation of death, it is the preparation for death, which makes the real difference, in point of safety, between man and man. The lesson I would draw from a sudden death, or from any number of sudden deaths, by which the hearts of a community may have been cast"], [28, "THE HAND AND THE SCBOLL. 25 down, is not the probability of such being your end. It is this rather. Contemplate seriously, while the sub ject is thus forced upon you, the greatness of that last change. If you see it here in its startling, naked awfulness ; if you see a man suddenly transferred in one moment (so far as consciousness is concerned) from the occupations of business and society, from the bench of justice, from the shop, from the ball-room, into the life of spirit, of eternity, of God; take advantage of this event to make the idea itself real to you; the idea of that other world, so near yet so unlike this : take the measure, so far as the poor ignorant mind can, of the dis tance and the difference; learn for your own instruction and warning, what it must be to have ceased to exist here; to have done for ever with business, with amusement, with house and home, and to have nothing to do,"], [29, "THE HAND AND THE SCBOLL. 26 for eternity, but with things and with persons quite apart and separate from the life of sense and body and time. And then ask yourselves, Supposing that I live out all my days ; supposing that I die at fourscore years, or by reason of strength come even to four score and ten years ; is there anything in that prolongation of being to make the change, when come it must, less formidable or less awful? Is that utmost possible extension of mortal life any real reason why I should post pone the endeavour after that sort of life in the present, which will be the only life \u2014 if I would escape torment \u2014 in the great, the eternal future ? 2. Again, the mournful event of last week has a special word of ad monition to our public men. You see the possibility of being called from the very midst of muni cipal business into the presence of God and judgment. One of you falls"], [30, "THE HAND AND THE SCBOLL. 27 dead at your council -table : another drops on your staircase, speechless and unconscious, suddenly vacating the President's Chair. Does not this spectacle show that these offices \u2014 coveted by some through ambition, held by others thoughtlessly and for self, made by others an arena of strife, dissension, and unchristian division \u2014 have nevertheless something in them of a more serious, a more religious \u2014 I will dare to say it, a more spiritual \u2014 significance? If a man may go straight from that council-chamber to meet his God, can it be a matter of indifference how he has sate there, and spoken, and voted, and judged ? Ought he not, while life is still his, and reason, and influence, and strength, to feel also, deeply and prac tically, his responsibility in that room to his neighbour and to his God? How ought that power to be wielded with a single-minded desire to make"], [31, "28 THE HAND AND THE SCBOLL. it subserve the interests of humanity, of charity, of piety, yea, of Christ and of God Himself in this Town ! How ought all selfishness and vanity and self-seeking to be put far away, and every nerve strained to use for good that talent, that large and weighty talent, which God has lent, not given ! 3. Once more, we see over again, in the past week's experience \u2014 as we have seen it a thousand times before \u2014 what is the estimate formed in the secret mind of all of us, of things desirable and undesirable, things good and things evil, in the character and in the life. You will always find a strong and (I think) a right as well as charitable anxiety on the part of survivors, to remove from the memory of a de parted neighbour, towards whom they have felt kindly, every possible impu tation of vice or inconsistency. You will find men, not themselves either"], [32, "THE HAND AND THE SCBOLL. 29 blameless or religious, collecting all that they can recall of good, and re senting keenly every charge of evil, concerning a lately departed friend. It is an instinct of humanity and of charity. Our own Church seems to share in that endeavour; bidding us, in her latest Office for her children, believe all things, and hope all things, as to those who have finally passed from man's censorship to God's tri bunal. But now, if this be so, do we not bear witness against ourselves, what manner of persons we ought to be, in all holy conversation and god liness? Is not this anxiety to clear the memory of the dead from every imputation of moral delinquency, a strong proof that we know what we ought to be, that we recognize man's duty towards God and his fellow, and that every step which we ourselves take in the direction of intemperance or of immorality is scarcely more re-"], [33, "30 THE HAND AND THE SCBOLL. proved by the Commandment than it is condemned and stigmatized by our selves ? O, let us take heed, while yet there is time, so to live, as we our selves testify that we shall wish that we had done, when we go hence and are no more seen ! 4. And so, finally, let us turn all our thoughts this way, and consider whether we, we ourselves, are in readi ness for our great change. God has sent us of late many mementos of the shortness of life. This time last year we were suffering under a brief but sharp visitation of pestilence : is it forgotten? If it came again now, are we more ready for it, in any sense, than last year \u2014 publicly, pri vately, individually, morally, spiritu ally? Remember the words of God by one of His Prophets : / have with holden the rain from you, ivhen there ivere yet three months to the harvest \u2014 / have smitten you with blasting and"], [34, "THE HAND AND THE SCBOLL. 31 mildew \u2014 / have sent among you the pestilence \u2014 your young men have I slain with the sword \u2014 / have over throivn some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye xoere as a firebrand plucked out of the burn ing : yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the Lord. Therefore thus tvill I do unto thee \u2014 and because I will do this iinto thee, prepare to meet thy God! If the Hand is sent to us, and the Roll of the Book in it is inscribed with the words, la mentation AND MOURNING AND WOE, it is for this purpose \u2014 and blessed is he who so reads it \u2014 that we may prepare, every one of us, to meet God. That end, a little nearer or a little further off, is before each one of us. We must all stand sepa rately before the judgment- seat of Christ. Let us so seek God now, in prayer, in humility, in the study of His Word, in all virtuous and godly"], [35, "32 THE HAND AND THE SCBOLL. living, that we may meet Him then with joy and not with shame, and enter into that blessed rest which He has prepared for all those who unfeignedly love Him, through Jesus Christ our Lord.
