But Signor Ronchetti did not seem to think so. \"La bella Signora\" might have been a miracle of perfection in his sight, for surely never was master so entranced Avith a pupil before, so utterly enamoured. It is true nothing of this Avas allowed to be seen by careful Aunt Dorothy, and if Mamma saw more warmth than was con sistent with mere singing lessons, she was herself so dazzled by the graceful attentions of the Italian, that she ascribed it all to the debghtful empressement of foreigners. Lucy could have enlightened her ; but the love made in secret was sweet, and so she did not think it absolutely requisite to say that, more than once, she had met the Signor by the river-side, and wandered through its most sequestered paths long after the even ing shadoAvs had fallen, giving and receiving confidences in most loArer-like fashion.

As the shades deepened on the hill, the mists cleared from her mental vision, and she saw such a picture of ingratitude and iniquity as made her shudder.

In vain \u2014 in vain. Those little fingers were never made to rend that Linen tick, or raise a padding so secured. She wore out her strength in shrieks and cries for help, in a wild hope some one within the Tower might hear her ; then, as she remembered how far she was isolated above inhabited rooms, she sank sobbing on the mattressed floor in despair and ex haustion. More than twenty-four hours had elapsed since she had tasted food, yet she felt no in clination to touch that placed for her. In times of overwhelming agony like hers food becomes positively repulsive.

Not that a thought of signals occurred to her when she awaked on the second morning following her incarceration.

Not more than three weeks had elapsed since the light was quenched on his hearth, yet there had been time for a delicately minded woman to perceive the false position she would occupy by remaining as mistress in the house of a young man, neither widower, bachelor, nor relative, and where there was no elderly matron to sanction her presence.

Still, there was nothing in her demeanour beyond the tender sympathy a sister might feel for a brother so wronged, no more than honest indignation at such an unprincipled deser tion of so kind a husband. But she was not his sister \u2014 not Eva's sister, \u2014 and if she did not feel the position perplexing, Mr. Rae burn did.

The temporary occupancy of his bachelor uncle had not, he knew, removed any mis taken impression ; so Mr. Raeburn, having no suspicion of fresh food for superstition, and grown too careless about so small a matter as attendance, did not trouble himself to remonstrate with ignorance, but let it pass. \" Pay them their wages and let them go, if they are dissatisfied ; that is, if you, Miss Wearbank, can in any way dispense with then services until I make fresh arrange ments.\" So they went, all but Beck, who slept in one of the rooms over the stables, and gave it as his opinion, and as a slice of encourage ment to Miss Wearbank, that if \" The Tower wur hanted it wur hanted by 'wick' yens;\" and he therefore bade her keep up her heart.

Before nightfall she Avas glad to eat the remains of yesterday's scraps ; she had all along been sparely fed, and then AA'as too hungry to be dainty. Hoav should she quench her thirst ?

In order to avoid so undeserved an imputation, it becomes a duty I owe both to myself and to my readers to state that the germ of the present story was a brief Christmas sketch written for the ' ' Durham Chronicle \" in the winter of 1 863 : the escape of Eva from the Tower being the main incident, consequently the tale (then called the \" Waif of the Wear \") was published about eighteen months prior to the production of \" Arrah-na pogue,\" and may, or may not, have suggested his wonderfully effective scene to the clever dramatist. I may here observe, for the benefit of those who might think the feat impossible, that the Tower, with some few slight deviations, has its well-known prototype, and that the scene was suggested to me by a positive occurrence, namely, the ascent of a burly youth of sixteen (whom my little son dubbed \" Milky \" from his calling) to procure a bird's nest for the child. \"Milky \" certainly did not mount to the battlements, but he did climb to a dizzy height, and, notwithstanding his weight, came back in safety with his prize, and that without aisturbing the ivy.

Fear of detection, dread of exposure \u2014 of punishment \u2014 these struck terror through her brain and chilled her heart. But there was no inaction in her terror, no loitering to gaze and dream. Ever prompt to decide and act upon de cision, she raised the frail form with scarcely a shudder, and drew it across the snow to the path, which, skirting the out-buddings, led to the ra\\ine.

By its clear light Rhoda passed her un resisting burden between the open bars, laid it down on the snoAv beside the frozen stream, and folloAving quickly, resumed her load and her tramp of the ravine into the sdent depths of the shadowy gorge.

It Avas a needless precaution ; for Mr. Marsh was fast asleep, and Rhoda in her own chamber out of sight and hearing, even if Nancy possessed less discretion and presence of mind than happened to fall to her share, and had screamed her very loudest.

Eva, ad unconscious of her husband's jealous suspicions, regarded each fresh atten tion as a proof only of his inexhaustible love, and garnered in her heart a store of gratitude to bless his after life.

A finger on Frank's lip was, however, a sufficient reminder, and the jest died in its birth. February brought a surprise to the Tower, and fresh motives for activity to Mr. Raeburn. Aunt Dorothy had gone home from her gentle ministration at the Tower only to en counter fresh tribulation on her brother's hearthstone. On the evening of Lucy's flight, as she quietly pushed her knitting pins through her large ball of cotton preparatory to clearing away Avork for the entrance of supper, her OAvn thoughts were echoed by her brother's question, \u2014 \" Where is Lucy ? \" \" In her own room, I believe,\" she an- p 2"], [222, "212 STUNG TO THE QUICK. swered, \" the bairn spends more of her time there alone in the cold, than I think good either for mind or body.\" \" I suppose she can please herself where she sits,\" thrust in Mrs. Hesketh, tartly, \" the company down-stairs is not so agree able now, that we need wonder if she does prefer solitude in the cold.

It was a scene of storm and recrimination, of anger conflicting with parental feeling, a scene too painful and too unpleasant to repeat in detail. Mrs. Hesketh's violence ended as usual. Miss Dorothea wept, but her tears fell for others only, and did not hinder her activity. She had loosened her brother's white necker chief, codar and vest, sprinkled his face, and shaken him into speech and consciousness ; and Avhilst words of anger, grief, affection and indignation came huddling together thick and fast from his lips, she found time to slip out and send Betty for her counsellor, Dr. Grove. Dr. Grove from his own doorstep had observed the Signor drive past, noting the circumstance more from the presence of a muffled female in the vehicle, than any connection between his oavu thought and the driver.

Mr. Hesketh's mind ran on Gretna Green, a bedes that the Signor was a fortune hunter running aAvay with Lucy for Avhat money she might in herit, having full possession of his mind. Dr. GroA'e assented to the possibility of the supposition, but felt inclined to hint that marriage was more desirable than probable.

Driving straight to the Turf Hotel, the groom Avas interrogated.

Then Lucy returned home, penitent and self-abased, but wonderfully improved thereby. Indeed, as years stole on, Dr. Grove was more than once heard to say Ned might do worse than marry Lucy Hesketh. True, the gossips had made free with her name, but the ring left by Rhoda in the wash basin, and the cork Avhich Dr. GroAre fitted to the phial before he left the hotel, were sufficient to prove her truth to all right minded people.

Only the previous week had the \" Court Journal,\" startled her with Lady Francis Raeburn's name and costume amongst others at the Drawing-Room. The Viscount had an eye for beauty, and he had extolled the fair lady in azure and pearl. To that he owed his acceptance. Lauded as she was, great as her musical fame, wealthy as her art had made her, she was stung to find that Eva entered society from which she was excluded. To be Mrs. Raeburn had been her OAvn highest dream. Eva, supplanting her in love, had supplanted her in life \u2014 Lady Raeburn ! Viscountess Greville would precede my Lady Raeburn.
