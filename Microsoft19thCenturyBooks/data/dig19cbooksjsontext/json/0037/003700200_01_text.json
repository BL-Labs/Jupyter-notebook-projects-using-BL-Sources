I have commenced the History of Scotland at the accession of Alexander the Third, be cause it is at this, period that our national annals become particularly interesting to the general reader. During the reign of this monarch, England first began to entertain serious thoughts of the reduction of her sister country. The dark cloud of misfortune which gathered over Scotland immediately after the death of Alexander, suggested to Edward the First his schemes of ambition and conquest ; and perhaps, in the history of Liberty, there is no more memorable war than that which took its rise under Wallace in 1297, and terminated in the final establishment of Scot tish independence by Robert Bruce in 1328. In the composition of the present work, I have anxiously endeavoured to examine the most authentic sources of information, and to convey to my reader a true picture of the times without prepossession or partiality."], [10, "PREFACE. 4 To have done so, partakes more of the nature of a grave duty than of a merit ; and even after this has been accomplished, there will remain ample room for many imperfections. If, in the execution of my plan, I have been obliged to differ on some points of importance from authors of established celebrity, I have fully stated the grounds of my opinion in the Notes and Illustrations, which are printed at the end of each volume ; and I trust that I shall not be blamed for the freedom of my remarks, until the historical authorities upon which they are founded have been examined and compared.

Alexander the Third had not completed his eighth year, when the death of the king, his father, on the 8th July, 1249, opened to him the peaceable acces sion to the Scottish throne.1 He was accordingly conducted by an assembly of the nobility to the abbey of Scone, and there crowned.2 1 Winton, vol. i. p. 380, book vii. chap. x.

B"], [24, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1249. 18 A long minority, at all times an unhappy event for a kingdom, was at this time especially unfortunate for Scotland. The vicinity of Henry the Third of England, who, although individually a weak monarch, allowed himself sometimes to be directed by able and powerful counsellors, and the divisions between the principal nobility of Scotland, facilitated the designs of ambition, and weakened the power of resistance ; nor can it be doubted that, during the early part of this reign, the first approaches were made towards that great plan for the reduction of Scotland, which was afterwards attempted to be carried into effect by Edward the First, and defeated by th^fcravery of Wallace and Bruce. But in order to snow clearly the state of the kingdom upon the accession of this monarch, and more especially in its relations with England, it will be necessary to go back a few years, to recount a story of private revenge which happened in the conclusion of the reign of Alexander the Second, (1242,) and drew after it important consequences. A tournament, the frequent amusement of this war like age, was held near Haddington, on which occasion Walter Bisset, a powerful baron, who piqued himself upon his skill in his weapons, was foiled by Patrick earl of Athole.1 An old feud which existed between these families imbittered the defeat ; and Athole was found murdered in his house, which, probably for the purpose of concealment, was set on fire by the assas sins. The suspicion of this slaughter, which, even in an age familiar with ferocity, seems to have excited unwonted horror, immediately fell upon the Bissets ; 1 Henry earl of Athole had two daughters, Isobel and Fernelith. Isobel married Thomas of Galloway. Their only son was Patrick earl of Athole. Fernelith married David de Hastings.\u2014 Hailes' An nals, vol. i. p. 157. Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 72. Math. Paris, p. 586."], [25, "1249. ALEXANDER III. 19 and, although Walter was the person present at the tournament, the popular clamour pointed to William, the chief of the family.1 He was pursued by the nobility, who were incited to vengeance by the Earl of March and David de Hastings ; and would have been torn to pieces had not the interference of the king protected him from the fury of the friends of Athole. Bisset strenuously asserted his innocence. He offered to prove that he had been fifty miles distant from Haddington when the murder was committed ; he instantly procured the sentence of excommunication against tha/assassins to be published in every chapel in Scotlar^p he offered combat to any man who dared abide the issue ; but he declined a trial by jury on account of the inveterate malice of his enemies. The king accepted the office of judge : the Bissets were con demned, their estates forfeited to the crown, and they themselves compelled to swear upon the Holy Gospel that they would repair to Palestine, and there, for the remaining days of their lives, pray for the soul of the murdered earl. Walter Bisset, however, instead of Jerusalem, sought the English court.2 There, by artfully representing to the king that Alexander owed him fealty, and that, as lord superior, he ought to have been first consulted before judgment was given, whilst he described Scot land as the ally of France and the asylum of his expatriated rebels,3 he contrived to inflame the passion 1 Lord Hailes remarks, vol. i. p. 157, that Fordun says the author of the conspiracy was Walter. Fordun, on the contrary, all along ascribes it, or rather says it was ascribed, to William Bisset. \u2014 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. pp. 72, 73, 74. The name of the Bisset banished from Scotland, as shown in the Patent Rolls of Hemy the Third, is Walter. 2 Chronicon, Melross, a Stevenson. Bannatyne edition, p. 156. 3 Math. Paris, pp. 643, 645. Speed's Chronicle, p. 527. Speed ascribes the disagreement between Henry and Alexander to the influence of"], [26, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1249. 20 of the English monarch to so high a pitch, that Henry determined on an immediate invasion. Nor was the temper with which Alexander received this information in any way calculated to promote conciliation. To the complaints of the King of England, that he had violated the duty which he owed to him as his lord paramount, the Scottish monarch is said to have answered, that he neither did, nor ever would, consent to hold from the King of England the smallest portion of his kingdom of Scotland. His reply was warmly seconded by the spirit of his nobility. They fortified the castles on the marches ; and the king soon found himself at the head of an army of nearly a hundred thousand foot and a thousand horse. Henry, on the other hand, led into the field a large body of troops, with which he proceeded to Newcastle. The accoutre ments and discipline of these two powerful hosts, which were commanded by kings, and included the flower of the nobility of both countries, are highly extolled by Mathew Paris.1 The Scottish cavalry, according to his account, were a fine body of men, and well mounted, although their horses were neither of the Spanish nor Italian breed ; and the horsemen were clothed in armour of iron net-work. In the number of its cavalry the English army far surpassed its rival force, including a power of five thousand men-at-arms, sumptuously accoutred.

As Alexander, however, was .much beloved in England, the nobility of that country coldly seconded the rash enterprise of their king, and showed no anxiety to hurry into hostilities. Richard earl of Cornwall, brother to Henry, and the Archbishop of York, thought this a favourable moment for proposing an armistice ; and by their endeavours, such great and solemn preparations ended in a treaty of peace, with out a lance being put in rest. Its terms were just, and favourable to both countries.1 Henry appears prudently to have waved all demand of homage from Alexander for the kingdom of Scot land; and the Scottish monarch, on the other hand, who possessed land in England for which, although the English historians assert the contrary, he does not appear to have ever refused homage, consented, for himself and his heirs, to maintain fidelity and affection to Henry and his heirs, as his liege lord, and not to enter into any league with the enemies of England, except in the case of unjust oppression. It was also stipulated, that the peace formerly signed at York, in the presence of Otto the pope's legate, should stand good ; and that the proposal there made, of a marriage between the daughter of the King of Eng land and the son of the King of Scots, should be carried into effect. Alan Durward, at this time the most accomplished knight and the best military leader in Scotland, Henry de Baliol, and David de Lindesay, with other knights and prelates, then swore on the soul of their lord the king, that the treaty should be kept inviolate by him and his heirs.2 1 Rymer, vol. i. pp. 374, 428.

The mode in which the ceremony of his coronation was performed, is strikingly illustrative of the manners of that age. The Bishops of St Andrews and Dunkeld, with the Abbot of Scone, attended to officiate ; but an unexpected difficulty arose. Alan Durward, the great justiciary, remarked, that the king ought not to be crowned before he was knighted, and that the day fixed for the ceremony was unlucky. The objec tion was selfish, and arose from Durward, who was then at the head of the Scottish chivalry, expecting that the honour of knighting Alexander would fall upon himself.2 But Comyn earl of Menteith, insisted that there were frequent examples of the consecration of kings before the solemnity of their knighthood ; he represented that the Bishop of St Andrews might perform both ceremonies; he cited the instance of William Rufus having been knighted by Lanfranc archbishop of Canterbury ; and he earnestly urged the danger of delay. Nor was this danger ideal. Henry the Third, in a letter to Rome, had artfully represented Scotland as a fief of England; and had requested the pope to interdict the ceremony of the coronation until Alexander obtained the permission of his feudal superior.3 found in Mathew Paris, p. 646, and in Rymer, Feed., vol. i. p. 428.

The Bishop of St Andrews girded the king with the belt of knighthood, and ex plained to him the respective oaths which were to be taken by himself and his subjects, first in Latin, and afterwards in Norman French.1 They then conducted the boy to the regal chair, or sacred stone of Scone, which stood before the cross in the eastern division of the chapel. Upon this he sat : the crown was placed on his head, the sceptre in his hand ; he was invested with the royal mantle ; and the nobility, kneeling in homage, threw their robes beneath his feet. A High land sennachy or bard, of great age, clothed in a scarlet mantle, with hair venerably white, then advanced from the crowd; and, bending before the throne, repeated, in his native tongue, the genealogy of the youthful monarch, deducing his descent from the fabulous Gathelus. It is difficult to believe that, even in those days of credulity, the nobility could digest the absurdities of this savage genealogist.2 Henry the Third at this time, influenced by the devotional spirit of the age, had resolved on an expe dition to the Holy Land ; and in order to secure tranquillity to his dominions on the side of Scotland, the marriage formerly agreed on, between his daughter Margaret and the young Scottish king, was solemnized at York on Christmas day, with much splendour and dignity.3 The guests at the bridal were the King 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 81. * Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. pp. 80, 81, 82.

When Alexander performed homage for the lands which he held in England, Henry, relying upon the facility incident to his age, artfully proposed that he should also render fealty for his kingdom of Scotland.

The ground on which this accusation rested, was an attempt of Durward, in which he was seconded by the Scottish chancellor,2 to procure from the court of Rome the legitimation of his wife, in order, said his accusers, that his children should succeed to the crown, if the king happened to die without heirs. From the ambitious and intriguing character of Dur ward, this story probably had some foundation in fact, and certain persons who were accused, actually fled from York ; upon which Henry made a new appointment of guardians to the young king, at the head of whom were placed the Earls of Menteith and Mar. The peace of Scotland was for many years after this interrupted by that natural jealousy of England, so likely to rise in a kingdom its equal in the sense of independence, although its inferior in national strength. Henry, too, adopted measures not calculated to secure the confidence of the Scottish people. He sent into Scotland, under the name of guardian to the king, Geoffry de Langley, a rapacious noble, who was imme diately expelled. He procured Innocent the Fourth 1 Math. Paris, p. 829.

Many English attendants, some of them persons of rank and consequence, accompanied Margaret into her new kingdom ; and between these intruders and the ancient nobility of Scotland, who fiercely asserted their privileges, disputes arose, which soon reached the ears of the English court. The young queen, accustomed to the indulgence and superior refinement of her father's court, bitterly lamented that she was immured in a dismal fortress, without being permitted to have her own attendants around her person, or allowed to enjoy the society of her husband the king.2 These complaints, which appear to have been high ly exaggerated, and a still more horrid report that the queen's physician had been poisoned by the same party because he ventured to remonstrate against the con finement of his mistress, were not lost upon Alan Durward, the late justiciar. He had accompanied Henry in his expedition to Guienne, where, by his courage and address, he regained the confidence of that capricious monarch ;3 and he now prevailed upon the king to despatch the Earl of Gloucester, and Maunsell his chief secretary, to the Scottish court, for the purpose of dismissing those ministers who were found not sufficiently obsequious to England. 4 In sending these noblemen upon this mission, Henry 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. i. p. 523. 2 Math.

At the head of the party which steadily opposed the interested schemes of Henry, was Walter Comyn earl of Men teith, whose loyalty we have seen insisting on the speedy coronation of the young king, when it was attempted to be deferred by Alan Durward. Many of the principal nobility, and some of the best and wisest of the clergy, were found in the same ranks. The Earl of Gloucester and his associates accord ingly repaired to Scotland ; and, in concert with the Earls of Dunbar, Strathern, and Carrick, surprised the castle of Edinburgh, relieved the royal couple from the real or pretended durance in which they were held, and formally conducted them to the bridal cham ber, although the king was yet scarcely fourteen years of age.2 English influence appears now to have been predominant ; and Henry, having heard of the success of his forerunners Maunsell and Gloucester, and con ceiving that the time was come for the reduction of Scotland under his unfettered control, issued his writs to his military tenants, and assembled a numerous army. As he led this array towards the borders, he took care to conceal his real intentions, by directing, from Newcastle, a declaration, that in this progress to visit his dear son Alexander, he should attempt 1 Rymer, vol. i. p. 559. 2 Math.

The government of Scotland was there remodelled ; a new set of counsellors appointed ; and the party of the Comyns, with John Baliol and Robert de Ross, completely deprived of their political influence. In the instruments drawn up upon this occasion, some provisions were inserted, which were loudly com plained of as derogatory to the dignity of the king dom ; the abettors of England were stigmatized as conspirators, who were equally obnoxious to prelates, barons, and burgesses ; and the Bishop of Glasgow, the Bishop-elect of St Andrews, the chancellor, and the Earl of Menteith, indignantly refused to affix their seals to a deed, which, as they asserted, compro mised the liberties of the country.2 A regency was now appointed, which included the whole of the clergy and the nobility who were favour able to England,3 to whom were intrusted the custody of the king's person, and the government of the realm for seven years, till Alexander had reached the age of twenty-one.

Thus ended a negotiation conducted entirely by Eng lish influence ; and which, although the ambition of the Comyns may have given some plausible colour to the designs of their enemies, was generally and justly unpopular in Scotland.2 Alexander and his queen now repaired to Edinburgh ; and Henry, after having attempted to recruit his exhausted coffers, by selling a pardon to John de Baliol, and confiscating the estates of Robert de Ross, returned to commit new attacks upon the property of his English subjects.3 1 Rotul.

There were at this time in that kingdom thirty-two knights and three powerful earls of the name of Comyn ; 1 and these, with their armed vassals, assisted by many of the disgraced nobility, formed an effectual check upon the measures of the regency. Gamelin, the Bishop elect of St Andrews, and the steady enemy of English influence, unawed by his late removal, procured him self to be consecrated by the Bishop of Glasgow ; and although placed without the protection of the laws, he yet, in an appeal to the court of Rome, induced the pope to excommunicate his accusers, and to declare him worthy of his bishopric.2 Henry, enraged at the bold opposition of Gamelin, prohibited his return, and issued orders to arrest him if he attempted to land in England ; while the regents performed their part in the persecution, by seizing the rich revenues of his see.3 In the midst of these scenes of faction and distur bance, the King and Queen of Scotland proceeded to London on a visit to their father, and were received with great magnificence. They were entertained at Oxford, Woodstock, and in London. Tents were raised in the meadows for the accommodation of their followers ; and Henry renewed to Alexander a grant of the honour of Huntingdon, which had been held by some of his predecessors.4 The party of the Comyns, however, were slowly regaining ground.

A nego tiation at length took place at Roxburgh ; and the nobility and principal knights, who had leagued with Henry, engaged to submit themselves to the king and the laws, and to settle all disputes in a conference to be held at Forfar. This was merely an artifice to gain time, for they immediately fled to England ; and the Earls of Hereford and Albemarle, along with John de Baliol, soon after repaired to Melrose, where the Scottish king awaited the arrival of his army. Their avowed purpose was to act as mediators between the two factions : their real intention to seize, if possible, the person of the king, and to carry him into England.1 But the plot was suspected ; and Alexander, with the Comyns, defeated all hopes of its success, by appoint ing for the scene of their conference the forest of Jed burgh, in which a great part of his troops had already assembled. The two English earls, therefore, resumed their more pacific design of negotiation. It was difficult and protracted ; so that in the interval, the king and the Comyns, having time to collect a large force, found themselves in a situation to insist upon terms which were alike favourable to their own power and to the liberty of the country. The King of England was compelled to dissemble his animosity, to foro-et his bitter opposition against Bishop Gamelin, and to reserve to some other opportunity all reference to the obnoxious treaty of Roxburgh.

In short, the struggle to resist English interference was fatal, for the time, to the prosperity of the kingdom ; and what Scotland gained in inde pendence, she lost in improvement and national hap piness.2 At this crisis, when they had effectually succeeded in diminishing, if not destroying, the English influ ence, the Comyns lost the leader whose courage and energy were the soul of their councils.

Horton arrived at the period when the king and his nobles were assem bled in council, and found them jealous of this per petual interference of England. They deemed these visits incompatible with the independence of the coun try ; and the messenger of Henry met with great opposition.2 The nature of the message increased this alarm. It was a request that Alexander and his queen should repair to London, to treat of matters of great importance, but which were not communicated to the parliament ; and it was not surprising that the nobility, profiting by former experience, should have taken precautions against any sinister designs of Henry. Accordingly, the Earl of Buchan, Durward the justiciar, and the Chancellor Wishart, were in their turn despatched upon a secret mission into Eng land ; and the result was, that Alexander and his queen consented to visit London, under two condi tions : first, an express stipulation was made that, during their stay at court, neither the king, nor any of his attendants, were to be required to treat of state affairs ; and, secondly, an oath was to be taken by the English monarch, that if the Queen of Scotland be came pregnant, or if she gave birth to a child during her absence, neither the mother nor the infant should be detained in England ;3 so great, at this moment, 1 Hailes' Hist., vol. i. p. 172, 4to. 2 Math.

On her approach to St Aibans, she was met by her younger brother Edmund, who received her with a splendid retinue, and conducted her in the morning to London. The object of this visit of Alex ander was not solely to gratify the King of England. He was anxious to exercise his rights over the terri tory of Huntingdon, which he held of the English crown ; and the payment of his wife's portion had been so long delayed, that he wished to reclaim the debt. The reception of the royal persons appears to have been unusually magnificent ; and the country round the court was greatly exhausted by the sump tuous entertainments, and the intolerable expenses which they demanded.1 In the midst of these fes tivities, the queen drew near her time ; and, at the pressing instance of her father, it was agreed that she should lie-in at the court of England : not however without a renewed stipulation, sworn upon the soul of the king, that the infant, in the event of the death of its mother or of Alexander, should be delivered to an appointed body of the Scottish nobility.

The little sovereignties of these islands, under the protection of a warlike government, appear to have been in a flourishing condition. They were crowded with people ; and the useful and ornamental arts were carried in them to a higher degree of perfec tion than in the other European countries. A poet of the north, in describing a dress unusually gorgeous, adds, that it was spun by the Sudreyans.2 And even in science and literature, this remarkable people had, in their colonies especially, attained to no inconsider able distinction.3 The vicinity of such enterprising neighbours was particularly irksome to the Scottish kings, and they anxiously endeavoured to get possession of these islands. When treaty failed, they encouraged their subjects of Scotland to invade them ; and Alan lord of Galloway, assisted by Thomas earl of Athole, about thirty years before this, carried on a successful war against the isles, and expelled Olaf the Black, King of Man, from his dominions.4 These Scottish chiefs 1 Macpherson's Geographical Illustrations of Scottish History, under the word \" His.\" A valuable work. 2 Johnstone's Lodbrokar-Quida, stanza xv. and explanatory note. 3 Macpherson's Illustrations, ut supra, voce \" His.\" i Johnstone, Antiquitates Celto-Normannic\u00e6, p. 30.

After this, the authority of Norway became gradually more and more precarious through out the isles. Some of the chiefs were compelled, others induced by motives of interest, to renounce their allegiance, and to embrace the nearer superiority of Scotland : some, who held lands of both crowns, were uncertain to whom they should pay their para mount allegiance ; and Alexander the Second, the immediate predecessor of Alexander the Third, after an unsuccessful attempt at negotiation, prepared an expedition for their complete reduction. The expres sions used in threatening this invasion, may convince us that the Norwegians had not only acquired the sovereignty of the isles, but had established them selves upon the mainland of Scotland ; for the Scot tish king declares, \" that he will not desist till he hath set his standard upon the cliffs of Thurso, and subdued all that the King of Norway possessed to the west ward of the German Ocean.\" 2 Alexander the Second, however, lived only to conduct his fleet and army to the shores of Argyleshire ; and, on the king's death, the object of the expedition was abandoned.2 During the minority of Alexander the Third, all idea of reducing the isles seems to have been aban doned ; but when the king was no longer a boy, the Antiquaries, p. 356, vol. ii. p. 2.

Their expedition was accompanied with circumstances of extreme cruelty. The ketherans and soldiers of the isles, if we may believe the Norwegian Chronicles, not content with the sack of villages and the plunder of churches, in their wanton fury raised the children on the points of their spears, and shook them till they fell down to their hands : barbarities which might be thought incredible, were we not ac quainted with the horrid atrocities which, even in our own days, have accompanied piratic warfare.2 Such conduct effectually roused Haco, the Norwe gian king. He determined to revenge the injuries offered to his vassals, and immediately issued orders for the assembling of a fleet and army, whilst he re paired in person to Bergen to superintend the prepar ations for the expedition. The magnitude of these spread an alarm even upon the coasts of England. It was reported, that the Kings of Denmark and Norway, with an overwhelming fleet, had bent their course against the Scottish islands ; 3 and although the ap parent object of Haco was nothing more than the protection of his vassals, yet the final destination of so powerful an armament was anxiously contemplated. On the 7th of July, the fleet set sail from Herlover. The king commanded in person. His ship, which had 1 Chronicle of Man, p. 45. 2 The Chronicle of Man, p. 45, says the Earl of Ross was assisted by Kearnach and the son of Macalmal. Macalmal is conjectured to be Macdonald.

It was midsummer, the day was fine, and innumerable flags and pennons flaunted in the breeze ; the decks were crowded with knights and soldiers, whose armour glittered in the sun ; and the armament, which was considered as the most powerful aud splendid that had ever sailed from Norway, bore away with a light wind for Shetland, which it reached in two days.2 Haco thence sailed to Orkney, where he proposed to separate his forces into two divisions, and to send one of these to plunder in the Firth of Forth ; whilst he himself remained in reserve, with his largest ships and the greater part of his army, in Orkney. It happened, however, that the higher vassals and retainers, who appear to have had a powerful influence in the general direction of the expedition, refused to go any where without the king himself; and this project was abandoned.3 The fleet, therefore, directed its course to the south ; and, after being joined by a small squadron which had previously been despatched to the westward,4 Haco conducted his ships into the bay of Ronaldsvoe, and sent mes- sengers to the neighbouring coast of Caithness to levy contributions. This country, exposed from its situa tion to perpetual piratic invasions, was, as we have seen, in 1249 under the dominion of Norway. But 1 Norse Account of this Expedition, with its translation, published by Johnstone, p. 25.

The exertions of the Scottish government had succeeded in reducing the inhabitants ; hostages were exacted for their fidelity ; and now we find this remote district in the state of a Scottish province, exposed to the exactions of Norway. No aid, however, appeared from Scotland ; and the Caithnesians quietly submitted to the tribute which Haco imposed upon them. It is remarked by the Norwegian Chronicle, that when their king lay with his fleet in Ronaldsvoe, \" a great darkness drew over the sun, so that only a little ring was bright round his orb.\" The ancient historian thus unconsciously afforded to modern science the means of exactly ascer taining the date of this great expedition. The eclipse was calculated, and it was found to have taken place on the 5th of August, 1263,1 and to have been annular at Ronaldsvoe in Orkney ; a fine example of the clear and certain light reflected by the exact sciences upon history. Early in August, the king sailed across the Pentland Firth, having left orders for the Orkney men to follow him when their preparations were com pleted ; thence he proceeded by the Lewes to the Isle of Sky, where he was joined by Magnus, the Lord of Man; and from this holding on to* the Sound of Mull, he met Dugal and other Hebridean chiefs with their whole forces. The united armament of Haco now amounted to above a hundred vessels, most of them large, all well provided with men and arms ; and, on the junction of the fleet, the business of piracy commenced. A divi sion of the forces first took place.2 A squadron of fifty ships, under Magnus and Dugal, was sent to 1 The Chronicle of Melross is thus evidently wrong in placing this expedition in 1262. 2 Norse Account of the Expedition, p. 49."], [47, "1263. ALEXANDER III. 41 plunder in the Mull of Kentire ; five ships were de spatched for the same purpose to Bute ; and the king himself, with the rest of the fleet, remained at Gigha, a little island between the coast of Kentire and Isla. He was here met by King John, one of the island chiefs, whom Alexander the Second had in vain attempted to seduce from his fidelity to Norway. John was now, however, differently situated; and a scene took place which is strongly illustrative of feudal manners. Haco desired him to follow his banner, as was his duty ; upon which the island prince excused himself. He affirmed that he had taken the oaths as a vassal of the Scottisli king; that he held of him more lands than of his Norwegian master; and he entreated Haco to dispose of all those estates which he had conferred on him. This reasoning, although not agreeable to his powerful superior, was apparently such as Haco could not dispute ; and after a short time John was dismissed, not only uninjured, but with presents.1 Many of these island chiefs found themselves, dur ing this northern invasion, in a very distressing situa tion. On one hand, the destroying fleet of Haco lay close to the shores of their little territories, eager to plunder them should they manifest the slightest resistance. On the other, they had given hostages for their loyal behaviour to the King of Scotland ; and the liberty, perhaps the lives, of their friends or their children were forfeited if they deserted to the enemy. In this cruel dilemma was Angus lord of Kentire and Isla, apparently a person of high authority in these parts, and whose allegiance the Scottish king seems to have adopted every method to secure. He held 1 Norse Account of the Expedition, p. [51. See also p. 69."], [48, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1263. 42 his infant son as a hostage ; an instrument had been drawn out, which declared his territories subject to instant forfeiture if he deserted ; and the barons of Argyle were compelled to promise that they would faithfully serve the king against Angus of Isla, and unite in accomplishing his ruin, unless he continued true to his oaths.1 But the power of the King of Scotland was remote ; the vengeance of piratical war fare was at his door ; and Angus, with another island prince, Murchad of Kentire, submitted to Haco, and delivered up the whole lands which they held of Alexander. A fine of a thousand head of cattle was esteemed a proper punishment for their desertion from Norway ; and when they renewed their oaths to Haco, he promised, what he did not live to perform, to recon cile them to the offended majesty of Scotland.2 In the meantime, the squadron, which had been despatched towards the Mull of Kentire, made a de solating descent upon the peninsula ; but in the midst of their havoc, and when they were proceeding to attack the greater villages, they received letters from Haco, forbidding them to plunder, and commanding them to rejoin the King's fleet at Gigha. Haco next despatched one of his captains, with some small vessels, to join the little squadron which had sailed against Bute ; and intelligence soon after reached him, that the castle of Rothesay, in that island, had been taken by his soldiers, and that the Scottish garrison had capitulated. A pirate chief, named Roderic, who claimed Bute as his inheritance, but who had been opposed by the islanders and outlawed by Alexander, 1 Observations on the Norwegian Expedition, Antiquarian Trans actions, pp. 367, 368.

His knowledge of the seas in these quarters made him useful to the invaders, and the power of Haco enabled him to gratify his re venge. He accordingly laid waste the island, basely murdered part of the garrison of Rothesay, and lead ing a party of plunderers from Bute into Scotland, carried fire and sword into the heart of the neighbour ing country.1 While the king's fleet lay at Gigha, Haco received messengers from the Irish Ostmen, with proposals of submitting themselves to his power ; under the condi tion that he would pass over to Ireland with his fleet, and grant them his protection against the attacks of their English invaders, who had acquired the principal towns upon the coast. In reply to this proposal, the king despatched Sigurd, one of his chief captains, to communicate with the Ostmen ;2 and in the meantime, he himself, with the whole fleet, sailed round the point of Kentire, and, entering the Firth of Clyde, anchored in the sound of Kilbrannan, which lies between the island of Arran and the mainland. Hitherto the great body of the Norwegian fleet had 1 Norse Account of the Expedition, pp. 63, 67.

But the whole naval armament of Haco, amounting to a hundred and sixty ships, as it entered the Firth of Clyde, became conspicuous from the opposite shores of Kyle, Carrick, and Wig town ; and the more immediate danger of a descent, induced the Scottish government to think seriously of some terms of pacification. Accordingly, there soon after arrived from Alexander a deputation of Pr\u00e6di cant, or Barefooted Friars, whose object was to sound Haco regarding the conditions upon which a peace might be concluded ; and, in consequence of these overtures, five Norwegian commissioners1 were sent to treat with the King of Scotland. They were hon ourably received by Alexander, and dismissed with a promise, that such terms of accommodation as the Scottish king could consent to, should be transmitted to Haco within a short time ; and in the meanwhile a temporary truce was agreed on. This was wise : for to delay any pacification, with out irritating their enemy, was the manifest policy of Scotland. Every day gave them more time to levy and concentrate their army ; and as the autumn was drawing to a close, it brought the Norwegians a nearer prospect of wreck and disaster from the winter storms. Envoys were now despatched from Alexander to Haco ; and the moderate demands of the King of Scotland made it apparent, that, at this moment, he was not prepared to resist the fleet and army of Norway. He claimed Bute, Arran, and the two islands of the 1 These were Gilbert bishop of Hamar, Henry bishop of Orkney Andrew Nicolson, Andrew Plytt, and Paul Soor. \u2014 Norse Account of the Expedition, p. 69."], [51, "ALEXANDER III. 1263. 45 Cumrays, all lying in the Firth of Clyde, as the pro perty of Scotland ; but it appears that he was willing to have given up to Norway the whole of the Isles of the Hebrides.1 These terms, so advantageous to Haco, were, fortunately for Scotland, rejected : no pacifica tion took place ; and the fleet of Norway bore in through the narrow strait between the larger and the lesser Cumray, thus menacing a descent upon the coast of Ayrshire, which is scarcely two miles distant. The crews had now run short of provisions, the weather was daily becoming more threatening, a strong Scottish force of armed peasants had gathered ou the shore, and Haco was anxiously exhorted by his officers to give orders for a descent on the coast, were it only to recruit, by plunder, the exhausted state of their provisions.2 This measure, it seems, he was unwilling to adopt, without a last message to the King of Scot land; and for this purpose he sent an ambassador3 to Alexander, whose commission was worded in the true style of ancient chivalry. He was to propose, \" That the sovereigns should meet amicably at the head of their armies, and treat regarding a peace, which if, by the grace of God, it took place, it was well ; but if the attempt at negotiation failed, he was to throw down the gauntlet from Norway, to challenge the Scottish monarch to debate the matter with his army in the field, and let God, in his pleasure, determine the vic tory.\" Alexander, however, would agree to no ex planation; but \"seemed,\" says the Norse Chronicle, \" in no respect unwilling to fight ;\"4 upon which the envoy returned from his unsatisfactory mission, and the truce was declared at an end. 1 Norse Account of the Expedition, p. 71. 2 Ibid. pp. 73, 75. 3 Kolbein Rich was his name. 4 Norse Account of the Expedition."], [52, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1263. 46 Haco next despatched a fleet of sixty ships up the Clyde, into Loch Long, under the command of Magnus king of Man, and with him four Hebridean chiefs, and two principal Norwegian officers. They penetra- ted and plundered to the head of Loch Long ; they then took to their boats, and dragging them across the narrow neck of land between Arrochar and Tar- bet, launched them into Loch Lomond, the islands of which lake were then full of inhabitants. To these islands the Scots had retreated for security, no doubt ; little anticipating the measure, which the lightness of the Norwegian craft, and the active perseverance of that bold people, enabled them to carry into execution. Their safeholds now became the scenes of plunder and bloodshed ; the islands were wasted with fire, the shores of this beautiful lake completely ravaged, and the houses on its borders burnt to the ground.1 After this, one of the Hebridean chiefs made an expedition into the rich and populous county of Stirling, in which he slew great numbers of the inhabitants, and returned driving herds of cattle before him, and loaded with booty.2 But the measure of Norwegian success was now full: the spirit of the Scottish nation was highly exas perated \u2014 time had been given them to collect their forces \u2014 and, as had been foreseen, the elements beo-an to fight on their side.

At midnight a cry of distress was heard in the king's ship; and before assistance could be given, the rigging of a transport, driven loose by the storm, got entangled with the royal vessel, and carried away her head. The transport then fell along side, so that her anchor grappled the cordage of the king's ship; and Haco, perceiving the storm increas ing, and finding his own ship beginning to drag her anchors, ordered the cable of the transport to be cut, and let her drift to sea. When morning came, she and another vessel were seen cast ashore. The wind still increased ; and the king, imagining that the powers of magic might be controlled by the services of religion, rowed in his long boat to the islands of the Cumrays, and there, amid the roaring of the elements, ordered mass to be celebrated.3 But the tempest increased in fury. Many vessels cut away their masts; his own ship, although secured by seven anchors, drove from her moorings ; five galleys were cast ashore, and the rest of the fleet violently beat up the channel towards Largs.4 1 Norse Account of the Expedition, pp. 81, 83, 84. 2 \" Now our deep-inquiring sovereign encountered the horrid powers of enchantment.

Before it appeared on the coast, the warders in the different castles which commanded a view of the sea, were directed to keep a strict look out ; a communication by beacons was established with the interior of the country -,1 and now, when the tempest seemed to threaten the total destruction of their enemies, a multitude of armed peasants hovered on the surrounding heights observing every motion of the Norwegian fleet, and ready to take instant advan tage of its distress. Accordingly, when the five galleys, with their armed crews, were cast ashore, the Scots rushed down from the heights, and attacked them. The Norwegians defended themselves with great gallantry ; and the king, as the wind had some what abated, succeeded in sending in boats with rein forcements; but as soon as their crews landed, the Scots retired, satisfying themselves with returning during the night, to plunder the transports.2 When morning broke, Haco came on shore with a large reinforcement, and ordered the transports to be lightened, and towed to the ships. Soon after, the Scottish army appeared at a distance, upon the hio-h grounds above the village of Largs ; and as it advanced, the sun's rays glancing from the lines, made it evident to the Norwegians, that a formidable body of troops were about to attack them. The cavalry, althouo-h they only amounted to fifteen hundred horsemen, had a formidable appearance on the heights, most of them being knights or barons from the neighbouring coun- 1 Observations on the Norwegian Expedition against Scotland, pp. 390, 391.

This force was led by the king in person, along with Alexander the High Steward of Scotland.2 On the shore, at this time, was a body of nine hundred Norwegians, commanded by three principal leaders ; two hundred men occupied in advance a small hill which rises behind the village of Largs, and the rest of the troops were drawn up on the beach. With the advance also was the king, whom, as the main battle of the Scots approached, his officers anxiously entreated to row out to his fleet, and send them farther reinforcements. Haco, for some time, pertinaciously insisted on remaining on shore ; but as he became more and more exposed, the barons would not consent to this, and at last prevailed on him to return in his barge to his fleet at the Cumrays. The van of the Scottish army now began to skirmish with the advance of the Norwegians, and, greatly outnum bering them, pressed on both flanks with so much fury, that, afraid of being surrounded and cut to pieces, they began a retreat, which soon changed into a flight. At this critical moment, when every thing depended on Haco's returning with additional forces before the main body of the Scots had time to charge his troops on the beach, a third storm came on, which completed the ruin of the Norwegian fleet, already shattered by the former furious gales. This cut off all hopes of 1 Norse Account of the Expedition, pp. 94, 95. 2 Norse Account of the Expedition, p. 95. Winton, vol. i. p. 387. Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 98. VOL. I.

The main body of the Scots far out numbered the force of the Norwegians;1 and their advance, under Ogmund, flying back in confusion, threw into disorder the small squadrons which were drawn up on the beach. Many of these attempted to save themselves, by leaping into their boats and push ing off from land ; others endeavoured to defend them selves in the transport which had been stranded ; and between the anger of the elements, the ceaseless showers of missile weapons from the enemy, and the impossibility of receiving succour from the fleet, their army was greatly distressed. Their leaders, too, be gan to desert them ; and their boats became over loaded and went down.2 The Norwegians were now driven along the shore ; but they constantly rallied, and behaved with their accustomed national bravery. Some had placed themselves in and round the stranded vessels ; and while the main body retreated slowly, and in good order, a conflict took place beside the ships, where Piers de Curry,3 a Scottish knight, was encountered and slain. Curry appears to have been a person of some note ; for he and the Steward of Scot land are the only Scottish soldiers whose names have come down to us as acting a principal part upon this occasion. His death is minutely described in the Norwegian Chronicle. Gallantly mounted, and splen didly armed, his helmet and coat of mail being inlaid with gold, Sir Piers rode fearlessly up to the Norwe gian line, attempting, in the chivalrous style of the 1 Norse Account of the Expedition, p. 97, says, that ten Scots fought against one Norwegian.

In this he was soon satisfied ; for a Norwegian, who conducted the retreat, irritated by his defiance, engaged him in single com bat, and, after a short resistance, killed him by a blow which severed his thigh from his body, the sword cut ting through the cuisses of his armour, and penetrating to his saddle.1 A conflict now took place round the body of this young knight, the plunder of whose rich armour the retreating Norwegians could not resist ; their little square was thrown into confusion ; and, as the Scots pressed on, the slaughter became great. Haco, a Norse baron, and near in blood to the king, was slain, along with many others of the principal leaders ; and the Norwegians would have been entirely cut to pieces, if they had not at last succeeded in bringing a reinforcement from the fleet, by landing their boats through a tremendous surf.2 These new troops instantly attacked the enemy upon two points; and their arrival reinspirited the Norsemen, and enabled them to form anew. It was now evening ; and the day had been occupied by a protracted battle, or rather a succession of obstinate skirmishes. The Norwegians, although they fought with uncommon spirit, had sustained severe loss ; and they now made a last effort to repulse the Scots from the high grounds immediately overhanging the shore. The impetuosity of their attack succeeded, and the enemy were driven back after a short and furious re sistance.3 The relics of this brave body of invaders then reimbarked in their boats, and, although the storm continued, arrived safely at the fleet. 1 Norse Account of the Expedition, p. 99. 2 Ibid. p. 101. 3 Norse Account of the Expedition, p. 103. \" At the conflict of corslets on the blood-red hill, the damasked blade hewed the mail of hostile tribes, ere the Scot, nimble as the hound, would leave the field to the followers of our all-conquering king.\""], [58, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1263. 52 During the whole of this conflict, which lasted from morning till night, the storm continued raging with unabated fury, and the remaining ships of Haco were dreadfully shattered and distressed. They drove from their anchors, stranded on the shore, where multitudes perished ; struck against shallow sand rocks, or found equal destruction by running foul of each other ; and the morning presented a beach covered with dead bodies, and a sea strewed with sails, masts, cordage, and all the melancholy accompaniments of wreck.1 A truce was uow granted to the king ; and the interval employed in burying his dead, and in raising above them those rude memorials, which, in the shape of tumuli and huge perpendicular stones, still remain to mark the field of battle. The Norwegians then burnt the stranded vessels ; and, after a few days, having been joined by the remains of the fleet, which had been sent up Loch Long, their shattered navy weighed anchor, and sailed towards Arran.2 In Lamlash bay the king was met by the commis sioners whom he had sent to Ireland ; and they assured him that the Irish Ostmen would willingly maintain his forces until he had freed them from the dominion of the English. Haco was eager to embrace the proposal. He appears to have been anxious to engage in any new expedition which might have banished their recent misfortunes from the minds of his soldiers, whilst it afforded him another chance of victory, with the certainty of reprovisioning the fleet : but their late disasters had made too deep an impression ; and, on calling a council, the Irish expedition was opposed by the whole army.3 1 Fordun, chap. xvi. book x. vol. ii. p. 98. 2 Observations on the Norwegian Exped.

The northern monarch, however, now felt the difference between sailing through this northern archipelago, as he had done a few months before, with a splendid and conquering fleet, when every day brought the island princes as willing vassals of his flag, and retreating, as he now did, a baffled invader. His boat crews were attacked, and cut off by the islanders. He appears to have in vain solicited an interview with John the prince of the Isles. The pirate chiefs who had joined him, disappointed of their hopes of plunder, returned to their ocean strongholds ; and although he went through the forms of bestowing upon his followers the islands of Bute and Arran, with other imaginary conquests, all must have seen, that the success aud power of Scotland rendered these grants utterly unavailing.1 The weather, too, which had been his worst enemy, continued louring, and winter had set in. The fleet encountered, in their return, a severe gale off Isla ; and, after doubling Cape Wrath, were met in the Pentland Firth by a second storm, in which one vessel, with all on board, went down, and another narrowly escaped the same fate. The king's ship, however, with the rest of the fleet, weathered the tempest, and at last arrived in Orkney on the 29th of October.2 It was here found advisable to grant the troops per mission to return to Norway ; as, to use the simple expression of the Norwegian Chronicle, \" many had already taken leave for themselves.\" At first the king resolved on accompanying them ; but anxiety of mind, the incessant fatigues in which he had passed the 1 Norse Account of the Expedition, pp. Ill, 113, 117. 2 Ibid. p. 119."], [60, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1263. 54 summer and autumn, and the bitter disappointment in which they ended, had sunk deep into his heart, and the symptoms of a mortal distemper began to show themselves in his constitution. His increasing sick ness soon after this confined him to his chamber ; and although for some time he struggled against the dis ease, and endeavoured to strengthen his mind by the cares of government and the consolations of religion, yet all proved in vain. At last, feeling himself dying, the spirit of the old Norse warrior seemed to revive with the decay of his bodily frame ; and, after some time spent in the services of the church, he commanded the Chronicles of his ancestors the Pirate Kings to be read to him. On the 12th of December, the principal of the nobility and clergy, aware that there was no hope, attended in his bedchamber. Though greatly debilitated, Haco spoke distinctly, bade them all affectionately farewell, and kissed them. He then received extreme unction, and declared that he left no other heir than Prince Magnus. The Chronicle of King Swerar was still read aloud to him when he was indisposed to sleep, but soon after this his voice became inaudible ; and on the 15th of December, at midnight, he expired.1 Such was the conclusion of this memorable expedi tion against Scotland, which began with high hopes and formidable preparations, but ended in the dis appointment of its object, and the death of its royal leader. It was evidently a fatal mistake in Haco to delay so long in petty expeditions against the Western Islands. While it was still summer, and the weather fair, he ought at once to have attempted a descent upon the mainland; and had he done so, Alexander 1 Norse Account of the Expedition, p. 131."], [61, "ALEXANDER III. 1263. 55 might have been thrown into great difficulties. Delay and protracted negotiation was the policy of the Scots. They thus avoided any general battle; and they knew that if they could detain the Norwegian fleet upon the coast till the setting in of the winter storms, its destruc tion was almost inevitable. Boece, in his usual inven tive vein, covers the field with twenty -five thousanddead Norwegians, and allows only four ships to have been saved to carry the king to his grave in Orkney. But all this is fiction ; and the battle of Largs appears to have been nothing more than a succession of fortunate skirmishes, in which a formidable armament was effec tually destroyed by the fury of the elements, judiciously seconded by the bravery of the Scots. The accounts of the death of Haco, and the news of the queen having been delivered of a son, were brought to King Alexander on the same day ; x so that he was at once freed from a restless and powerful enemy, and could look forward to a successor of his own blood. Nor did he lose any time in following up the advantages already gained, by completing the reduction of the little kingdom of Man, and the whole of the Western Isles. For this purpose, he levied an army with the object of invading the Isle of Man, and compelled the petty chiefs of the Hebrides to furnish a fleet for the transport of his troops. But the King of Man, terri fied at the impending vengeance, sent envoys with messages of submission ; and, fearful that these would be disregarded, set out himself, and met Alexander, who had advanced on his march as far as Dumfries.2 1 Winton, vol. i. pp. 389, 390.

A military force, commanded by the Earl of Mar, was next sent against those unfortunate chiefs of the Western Isles, who, during the late expedition, had remained faithful to Haco.1 Some were executed, all were reduced, and the disputes with Norway were finally settled by a treaty, in which that country agreed to yield to Scotland all right over Man, the \u00c6bud\u00e6, and the islands in the western seas. The islands in the south seas were also included, but those of Orkney and Shetland expressly excepted. The inhabitants of the Hebrides were permitted the option of either retiring with their property, or remaining to be governed in future by Scottish laws. On the part of the king and the estates of Scotland, it was stipu lated that they were to pay to Norway four thousand marks of the Roman standard, and a yearly quit-rent of a hundred marks sterling for ever.

ALEXANDER III. 57 Ottobon de Fieschi was at this time the papal legate in England ; and to defray the expenses of his visita tion, he thought proper to demand a contribution from each cathedral and parish church in Scotland. The king, however, acting by the advice of his clergy, peremptorily refused the demand ; appealed to Rome ; and, when Ottobon requested admittance into Scotland, steadily declared that he should not set a foot over the border. The legate next summoned the Scottish bishops to attend upon him in England whenever he should hold his council ; and he required the clergy to despatch two of their number to appear as their repre sentatives. This they agreed to ; but the representa tives were sent, not as the vassals of the papacy, but as the members of an independent church. Such, in deed, they soon showed themselves ; for when the legate procured several canons to be enacted regarding Scotland, the Scottish clergy resolutely disclaimed obedience to them. Incensed at this conduct, Cle ment the Fourth shifted his ground, and demanded from them a tenth of their benefices, to be paid to Henry of England, as an aid for an approaching crusade. The answer of Alexander and his clergy was here equally decided ; Scotland itself, they said, was ready to equip for the crusade a body of knights suitable to the strength and resources of the kingdom, and they there fore rejected the requisition. Accordingly, David earl of Athole, Adam earl of Carrick, and William lord Douglas, with many other barons and knights, assumed the cross, and sailed for Palestine.1 tical jurisdiction was reserved in favour of the Archbishop of Dron theim. 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 109, book x. chap. xxiv.

The Scottish clergy refused the contri bution ; appealed to Rome ; and, in addition to this, adopted measures which were singularly bold and well calculated to secure the independence of the Scottish church. They assembled a provincial council at Perth, in which a bishop of their own was chosen to preside, and where canons for the regulation of their own church were enacted. This they contended they were entitled to do, by the bull of Pope Honorius the Fourth, granted in the year 1225 ; and, aware of the importance of making a vigorous stand at this moment, by their first canon it was appointed that an annual council should be held in Scotland ; and by their second, that each of the bishops should assume, in rotation, the office of \" Protector of the Statutes,\" or Conservator Statutorum. These canons remain to this day, an interesting specimen of the ancient eccle siastical code of Scotland.1 About this time happened an incident of a romantic nature, with which important consequences were con nected. A Scottish knight of high birth, Robert de Bruce, son of Robert de Bruce lord of Annandale and Cleveland, was passing on horseback through the domains of Turnberry, which belonged to Marjory countess of Carrick.2 The lady happened at the mo ment to be pursuing the diversion of the chase, sur rounded by a retinue of her squires and damsels. They encountered Bruce. The young countess was struck by his noble figure, and courteously entreated 1 These canons were printed by Wilkins in his Concilia, and in a small 4to, by Lord Hailes.

ALEXANDER III. 59 him to remain and take the recreation of hunting. Bruce, who, in those feudal days, knew the danger of paying too much attention to a ward of the king, declined the invitation, when he found himself sud denly surrounded by the attendants ; and the lady, riding up, seized his bridle, and led off the knight, with gentle violence, to her castle of Turnberry. Here, after fifteen days' residence, the adventure concluded as might have been anticipated. Bruce married the countess without the knowledge of the relations of either party, and before obtaining the king's consent ; upon which Alexander seized her castle of Turnberry and her whole estates. The intercession of friends, however, and a heavy fine, conciliated the mind of the monarch. Bruce became, in right of his wife, Lord of Carrick ; and the son of this marriage of romantic love was the great Robert Bruce, the restorer of Scot tish liberty.1 Two years previous to this (1272) died Henry the Third of England,2 after a reign of nearly sixty years. His character possessed nothing that was great ; his genius was narrow ; his temper wavering ; his courage, happily, seldom tried ; and he was addicted, like many weak princes, to favouritism. At times, however, he had permitted himself to be guided by able ministers ; and the vigour, talents, and kingly endowments of his son Edward the First, shed a lustre over the last years of his reign, which the king himself could never have imparted to it. At the coronation of this great prince, who succeeded Henry, Alexander, and his queen, the new king's sister, attended with a retinue of great pomp and splendour. He took care, however, to obtain a letter under the hand of the English monarch, declar- 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 114, hook x. chap. xxix. 2 On 16th Nov. 1272."], [66, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1274. 60 ing that the friendly visit should not be construed into any thing prejudicial to the independence of Scotland,1 \u2014 a policy which the peculiarities of feudal tenure made frequent at this time ; for we find Edward him self, when some years afterwards he agreed to send twenty ships to the King of France, his feudal superior for the duchy of Normandy, requiring from that prince an acknowledgment of the same description. The designs of Edward upon Scotland had not yet, in any degree, betrayed themselves, and the kingly brothers appear to have met on cordial terms. Both were in the prime of manhood ; Alexander having entered, and Edward having just completed, his thirty fourth year. Scotland, still unweakened by the fatal controversies between Bruce and Baliol, was in no state to invite ambitious aggression. The kingdom was peaceful, prosperous, and loyal, possessing a war like and attached nobility, and a hardy peasantry, lately delivered, by the defeat of Haco and the wise acquisition of the Western Isles, from all disturbance in the only quarter where it might be dreaded ; and from the age of Alexander, and his queen, who had already born him three children, the nation could look with some certainty to a successor. Edward, on the other hand, who had lately returned from Palestine, where he had greatly distinguished himself, received his brother-in-law with that courtesy and kindness which was likely to be increased by his long absence, and by the perils he had undergone. About this time the pope sent into Scotland an emissary named Bene mund de Vicci, corrupted into Bagimont, to collect the tenth of all the ecclesiastical benefices ; the estimate being made not according to the \" ancient extent, but 1 Ayloffe's Calendar of Ancient Charters, 328, 342.

ALEXANDER III. 61 the true value.\" The tax appears to have been strictly exacted, aud went by the name of Bagimont's Roll.1 All went prosperously on between Edward and Alexander for some time. A dispute which had occurred between the King of Scots and the Bishop of Durham, in which that prelate complained that an encroachment had been made upon the English marches, was amicably settled ; and Edward, occupied entirely with his conquest of Wales, \u2014 and, according to his custom whenever engaged in war, concentrating his whole energies upon one point, \u2014 had little leisure to think of Scotland. The domineering disposition of the English king first showed itself regarding the feudal service of homage due to him by his Scottish brother, for the lands which he held in England ; and he seems early to have formed the scheme of entrapping Alex ander into the performance of a homage so vague and unconditional, that it might hereafter be construed into the degrading acknowledgment that Scotland was a fief of England. In 1277 we find him writing to the Bishop of Wells, that his beloved brother, the King of Scotland, had agreed to perform an unconditional homage, and that he was to receive it at the ensuing feast of Michaelmas.2 This, however, could scarcely be true ; the event showed that Edward had either miscon ceived or mis-stated the purpose of Alexander. He appeared before the English parliament at West minster, and offered his homage in these words : \u2014 \" I, Alexander king of Scotland, do acknowledge myself the liegeman of my lord Edward king of England against all deadly.\" This Edward accepted, reserving his claim of homage for the kingdom of 1 Fordun a Hearne, p. 780. 2 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. ii. p. 109."], [68, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1277. 62 Scotland, when he should choose to prefer it. The King of Scots then requested that the oath should be taken for him by Robert de Bruce earl of Carrick, which being granted, that earl took the oath in these words : \u2014 \"I, Robert earl of Carrick, according to the authority given to me by my lord the King of Scotland, in pre sence of the King of England, and other prelates and barons, by which the power of swearing upon the soul of the King of Scotland was conferred upon me, have, in presence of the King of Scotland, and commissioned thereto by his special precept, sworn fealty to Lord Edward king of England in these words : \u2014 ' I, Alex ander king of Scotland, shall bear faith to my lord Edward king of England and his heirs, with my life and members, and worldly substance; and I shall faith fully perform the services, used and wont, for the lands and tenements which I hold of the said king.' \" Which fealty being sworn by the Earl of Carrick, the King of Scotland confirmed and ratified the same.1 Such is an exact account of the homage performed by Alex ander to Edward, as given in the solemn instrument by which the English monarch himself recorded the trans action. Alexander probably had not forgotten the snare in which Edward's father had attempted to entrap him, when still a boy ; and the reservation of an un founded claim over Scotland might justly have incensed him. But he wished not to break with Edward : he held extensive territories in England, for which he was willing, as he was bound in duty, to pay homage ; yet 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. ii. p. 126. Tyrrel, vol. iii. p. 22, misled by Knighton, book iii. chap. i. erroneously says, that the homage was performed by Alexander at Edward's coronation ; and adds, that historians do not say whether it was for Scotland, or for the earldom of Huntingdon."], [69, "1278. ALEXANDER III. 63 he so guarded his attendance at Edward's coronation, and his subsequent oath of fealty, that the indepen dence of Scotland as a kingdom, and his own indepen dence as its sovereigu, were not touched in the most distant manner ; and the King of England, baffled in his hope of procuring an unconditional homage, was forced to accept it as it was given. It is material to notice, that in the instrument drawn up afterwards, recording the transaction, Edward appears to declare his understanding, that this homage was merely for the Scottish king's possessions in England, by again re serving his absurd claim of homage for Scotland, when ever he or his heirs should think proper to make it. This matter being concluded, Alexander, who had suffered a severe domestic affliction in the death of his queen,1 began to seek alliances for his children. He married his daughter Margaret to Eric king of Nor way, then a youth in his fourteenth year. Her portion was fourteen thousand marks, the option being left to her father to give one-half of the sum in lands, pro vided that the rents of the lands were a hundred marks yearly for every thousand retained. The price of land at this early period of our history seems, therefore, to have been ten years' purchase.2 The young princess, accompanied by Walter Bullock earl of Menteith, his countess, the Abbot of Balmerino, and Bernard de Monte-alto, with other knights and barons, sailed for Norway ; and on her arrival, was honourably received and crowned as queen. The alliance was wise and politic. It promised to secure the wavering fealty of those proud and warlike island chiefs, who, whenever 1 Winton, vol. i. p. 391. 2 The marriage-contract, which is very long and curious, is to be found in Rymer, vol. ii. p. 1079, dated 25th July, 1281.

Such alliances, so far as human foresight could reach, pro mised happiness to Alexander, while they gave an almost certain hope of descendants. But a dark cloud began to gather round Scotland, and a train of calami ties, which followed in sad and quick succession, spread despondency through the kingdom.2 The Prince of Scotland, who from infancy had been of a sickly con stitution, died not long after his marriage, leaving no issue ; and intelligence soon after came from Norway that his sister, Queeu Margaret, was also dead, having left an only child, Margaret, generally called the Maiden of Norway : David, the second son of Alex ander, had died when a boy ; 3 and thus the King of Scotland, still in the flower of his age, found himself a widower, and bereft by death of all his children. To settle the succession was his first care ; and for this purpose a meeting of the estates of the realm was held at Scone, on the 5th of February, 1283-4.

In the meantime, the king thought it prudent to make a second marriage, and chose for his bride, a young and beautiful woman, Joleta, daughter of the Count de Dreux. The nuptials were celebrated with great pomp, and in presence of a splendid con course of the French and Scottish nobility, at Jedburgh. In the midst of the rejoicings, and when music and pastime were at the highest, a strange masque was exhibited, in which a spectral creature like Death, glided with fearful gestures amongst the revellers, and at length suddenly vanished. The whole was no doubt intended as a mummery ; but it was too well acted, and struck such terror into the festive assembly,2 that the chronicler, Fordun, considers it as a super natural shadowing out of the future misfortunes of the kino-dom. These misfortunes too rapidly followed. Alexander, riding late, near Kinghorn, was counselled by his attendants, as the night was dark, and the road precipitous, not to pass Inverkeithing till the morning. Naturally courageous, however, he insisted in galloping forward, when his horse suddenly stumbled over a rocky cliff above the sea, fell with itsrider, and killed him on the spot.3 He died in tj^^fr-fifth year of his age, and the thirty-seventh oi| ftkn ; and his death, at this particular juncture, i?lr^e considered 1 Winton, vol. i. p. 397.

Alexander's person was majestic ; and although his figure was too tall, and his bones large, yet his limbs were well formed, and strongly knit. His counte nance was handsome, and beamed with a manly and sweet expression, which corresponded with the coura geous openness and sincerity of his character. He was firm and constant in his purposes ; yet, guided by prudence and an excellent understanding, this quality never degenerated into a dangerous obstinacy. His inflexible love of justice, his patience in hearing disputes, his affability in discourse, and facility of access, endeared him to the whole body of his people ; whilst his piety, untinctured with any slavish dread, whilst he acknowledged the spiritual supremacy of the popedom, rendered him the steadfast friend of his own clergy, and their best defender against any civil encroachments of the see of Rome. In his time, therefore, to use the words of the honest and affec tionate Fordun, \u2014 \" The Church flourished, its ministers were treated with reverence, vice was openly dis couraged, cunning and treachery were trampled under foot, inj ury ceased, and the reign of virtue, truth, and justice, was maintained throughout the land.\" We need not wonder that such a monarch was long and affectionately remembered in Scotland. Attended by his justiciary, by his principal nobles, and a military force which awed the strong offenders, and gave con fidence to the oppressed, it was his custom to make an annual progress through his kingdom, for the redress of wrong and the punishment of delinquents. For this purpose, he divided the kingdom into four great districts ; and on his entering each county, the sheriff had orders to attend on the kingly judo-e, with"], [73, "1286. ALEXANDER III. 67 the whole militia of the shire,1 and to continue with the court till the king had heard all the appeals of that county, which were brought before him. He then continued his progress, accompanied by the sheriff and his troops ; nor were these dismissed till the monarch had entered a new county, where a new sheriff awaited him with the like honours and atten dance. In this manner the people were freed from the charge of supporting those overgrown bands of insolent retainers which swelled the train of the Scottish nobles, when they waited on the king in his progresses ; and as the dignified prelates and barons were interdicted by law from travelling with more than a certain num ber of horse in their retinue, the poor commons had leisure to breathe, and to pursue their honest occupa tions.2 In Alexander's time, many vessels of different countries came to Scotland, freighted with various kinds of merchandise, with the design of exchanging them for the commodities of our kingdom. The king's mind, however, was unenlightened on the subject of freedom of trade ; and the frequent loss of valuable cargoes by pirates, wrecks, and unforeseen arrestments, had induced him to pass some severe laws against the exportation of Scottish merchandise. Burgesses, how ever, were allowed to traffic with these foreign mer chantmen ; and in a short time the kingdom became rich in every kind of wealth ; in the productions of the arts and manufactures ; in money, in agricultural produce,3 in flocks and herds ; so that many, says an 1 Fordun a Goodal, book x. chap. xli. vol. ii, p. 129. 2 Ibid. vol. ii. pp. 129, 130. 3 Yhwmen, pewere Karl, or Knawe That wes of mycht an ox til hawe,"], [74, "1286. 68 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. ancient historian, came from the West and East to consider its power, and to study its polity. Amongst these strangers, there arrived in a great body, the richest of the Lombard merchants, who offered to establish manufacturing settlements in various parts of the country. They specified among other places the mount above Queensferry, and an island near Cramond, and only asked of the king certain spiritual immunities. Unfortunately, the proposal of these rich and industrious men, for what cause we cannot tell, proved displeasing to some powerful members of the state, and was dismissed ; but from an expression of the historian we may gather, that the king himself was desirous to encourage them, and that favourable terms for a settlement would have been granted, had not death stept in and put an end to the negotiation.1 The conduct pursued by this king, in his inter course with England, was marked by a judicious union of the firmness and dignity which became an inde pendent sovereign with the kindliness befitting his near connexion with Edward ; but, warned by the attempts which had been first made by the father and followed up by the son, he took care that when in vited to the English court, it should be expressly ac knowledged2 that he came there as the free monarch of an independent country. To complete the character of this prince, he was temperate in his habits, his morals were pure, and in He gert that man hawe part in pluche ; Swa wes corn in his land enwche ; Swa than begouth, and ester lang Of land wes mesure, ane ox-gang.

Nor were these the only claimants. Nothing but the precarious life of an infant now stood between the crown of Scotland and the pretensions of other powerful competitors, whose relationship to the royal family, as it raised their hopes, encouraged them to collect their strength, and gave a legal sanction to their ambition. Edward the First of England, whose near connexion with the young Queen of Scotland and the heretrix of Norway made him her natural protector, was at this time in France. On being informed of the state of confusion into which the death of Alexander was likely to plunge a kingdom which had been for some time the object of his ambition, the project of a marriage between the young queen and his son the* Prince of Wales was too apparent not to suggest itself. But this monarch, always as cautious of too suddenly unveiling his purposes as he was determined in pur suing them, did not immediately declare his wishes. He contented himself with observing the turn which matters should take in Scotland, certain that his power and influence would in the end induce the different parties to appeal to him ; and confident that the longer time which he gave to these factions to quarrel among themselves and embroil the country, the more advan tageously would this interference take place. The youth of the King of Norway, father to the young Princess of Scotland, was another favourable circum stance for Edward. Eric was only eighteen. He naturally looked to Edward, the uncle of his late wife, for advice and support ; and, fearful of trusting his infant and only daughter, scarce three years old, to the doubtful allegiance of so fierce and ambi tious a nobility as that of Scotland, he determined"], [77, "1286. INTERREGNUM. 71 to keep her for the present under his own eye in Norway. Meanwhile a strong party was formed against her, amongst the most powerful of the Scottish barons. They met (Sept. 20, 1286) at Turnberry, the castle of Robert Bruce earl of Carrick, son of Robert Bruce lord of Annandale and Cleveland. Here they were joined by two powerful English barons, Thomas de Clare, brother of Gilbert earl of Gloucester, and Rich ard de Burgh earl of Ulster.1 Thomas de Clare was nephew to Bruce's wife, and both he and his brother the earl of Gloucester were naturally anxious to sup port Bruce's title to the crown, as the descendant of David earl of Huntingdon, brother of King William the Lion.2 Nor was the scheme in any respect a desperate one, for Bruce already had great influence. There assembled at Turnberry, Patrick earl of Dunbar, with his three sons ; Walter Stewart earl of Menteith ; Bruce's own son the Earl of Carrick, and Bernard Bruce ; James, the High Steward of Scotland,3 with John his brother ; Angus son of Donald the Lord of the Isles, and Alexander his son. These barons, whose influence could bring into the field the strength of almost the whole of the west and south of Scotland, now entered into a bond, or covenant, by which it was declared, that they would thenceforth adhere to and take part with one another, on all occasions, and against all persons, saving their allegiance to the King of Eng- 1 F\u0153dera, vol. ii. p. 488. 3 Gough, in his Additions to Camden's Britannia, vol. i. p. 265, mentions\" that Gilbert earl of Gloucester, brother of Robert de Bruce's wife, having incurred the resentment of Edward the First, was dispos sessed of all his lands ; but the king afterwards restored him, and gave him his daughter in marriage.

These soon increased, and at length broke into an open war be tween the parties of Bruce and Baliol, which for two years after the death of the king continued its ravages in the country.2 The event which the sagacity of Edward had anti cipated, now occurred. The states of Scotland were alarmed at the continuance of civil commotions ; and, in a foolish imitation of other foreign powers who had applied to Edward to act as a peacemaker, sent the Bishop of Brechin, the Abbot of Jedburgh, and Geoffrey de Mowbray, as ambassadors to the King of England, requesting his advice and mediation towards composing the troubles of the kingdom.3 At the same time, Eric king of Norway despatched plenipo tentiaries to treat with Edward regarding the affairs of his daughter the queen, and her kingdom of Scot land.

At his request, the Scottish regents appointed the Bishops of St Andrews and Glasgow, assisted by Robert Bruce lord of Annandale, and John Comyn, to treat in the presence of the King of England regard ing certain matters proposed by the Norwegian com missioners, and empowered them to ratify whatever was there agreed on, \" saving always the liberty and honour of Scotland ;\" and provided that from such measures nothing should be likely to occur prejudicial to that kingdom and its subjects.2 To this important conference the king, on the part of England, sent the Bishops of Worcester and Durham, with the Earls of Pembroke and Warrene. The place appointed was Salisbury ; but previous to the meeting of the plenipotentiaries, Edward had secretly procured a dispensation from the pope for the marriage of his son, the Prince of Wales, to the young Princess of Norway, as the youthful pair were within the forbidden degrees.3 No hint, however, of this pro jected union was yet suffered to transpire; and the commissioners met at Salisbury, where a treaty was drawn up, in which no direct allusion was made to the marriage, although it included provisions which evi dently bore upon this projected union. 1 Fordun a Goodal, book xi. chap. iii. p. 139. \u2022 Rymer, vol. ii. p. 431.

This wide and convenient clause evidently gave Edward the power of detaining the heretrix of the crown for an almost indefinite period in England ; and its being inserted in this treaty proves, that although Bruce, by accepting the office of commissioner, appeared to have abandoned his son's claim to the crown, Edward was suspicious that the interest which looked to a male successor to the crown was still pretty high in Scotland. By the third article, the states of Scotland undertook, before receiving their queen, to find security to the King of England that she should not marry without his coun sel and consent, and that of the King of Norway. The Scottish commissioners next engaged for themselves, that the quiet of the kingdom of Scotland should be established before the arrival of the queen, so that she might enter her dominions with safety, and continue therein at her pleasure. With regard to the removal of guardians, or public officers in Scotland, it was de termined, that should any of these be suspected per sons, or troublesome to the King of Norway or the Queen of Scotland, they should be removed, and bet ter persons appointed in their place, by the advice of the \" good men \" of Scotland and Norway, and of per sons selected for this purpose by the King of England ; and it was stipulated that these English commissioners"], [81, "1289. INTERREGNUM. 75 were ultimately to decide all disputes regarding pub lic measures which might occur between the ministers of Scotland and Norway, as well as all differences arising amongst the Scottish ministers themselves. It was finally agreed, that in the middle of the ensuing Lent, there should be a meeting of the estates of Scot land at Roxburgh ; by which time the Scottish pleni potentiaries engaged that every thing to which they had now consented should be fulfilled and ratified in the presence of the commissioners of England.1 Of this convention, three copies were made : one in Latin, which was transmitted to the King of Norway ; and two in French, retained for the use of the Scots and English. At this period, the majority of the nobility of both countries were of Norman-French extraction, and Norman-French was alike in England and Scot land the language in which state affairs were generally conducted. By this treaty, which gave so much power to Ed ward, and left so little to the estates of Scotland, it is evident that some of the Scottish commissioners were in the interest of the English king. Bruce, Lord of Annandale, had either altered his ambitious views, or he trusted that a temporary concealment of them, and the dissatisfaction which such a convention must occasion in Scotland, might ultimately turn to his ad vantage. Edward, iu the meantime, neglected nothing which could secure or increase the power which he had acquired. He addressed a letter to the estates of Scotland, requiring them to be obedient to their regents, and informing them, that he meant to send into that country some of the members of his council, from whom he might receive correct information of 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. ii. pp. 446, 447."], [82, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1289. 76 its condition.1 Although a dispensation from the pope was already obtained, no allusion to the intended marriage between Prince Edward and the young queen had been made throughout the whole treaty : Edward, with his usual calm foresight, seems privately to have directed the Scottish commissioners at Salis bury, three of whom were regents, to sound the nobi lity of Scotland on their return, and discover the feel ings of the people regarding the projected union., Accordingly, as soon as the important project became generally known, a meeting of the estates of Scotland assembled at Brigham, a village the Tweed, near Roxburgh, aud from thence directed a letter to Edward, which was signed by the dignified clergy and by all the earls and barons of the realm. It stated, that they were overjoyed to hear the good news which were now commonly spoken of, \u2014 \" that the Apostle had granted a dispensation for the mar riage of Margaret, their dear lady and their queen, with Prince Edward.\" It requested King Edward to send them early intelligence regarding this important measure ; and assured him of their full and ready con currence, provided certain reasonable conditions were agreed to, which should be specified by delegates, who would wait upon him at his parliament, to be held next Easter at London.2 A letter 3 was at the same time despatched by this 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. ii. p. 445. 3 Rymer, vol. ii. p. 471. 3 This important letter is in Norman-French, and as follows : \u2014 \" A tres noble Prince, Sire Eyrik, par la grace de Deu, Roy de Norway, Guillam e Robert, par meme cele grace, de Seint Andreu e de Glasgu Eveskes, Johan Comyn, & James Seneschal de Escoce, Gar dains de Reaume de Escoce, e tote la commune de meyme cele Reaume salut & totes honurs. \" Come nus feumes certayns ke vous seez desirous del honur, & del profist de nostre Dame, vostre fille, & de tutc le Reaume de Escoce,"], [83, "1289.

The nobility of Scotland could not be more anxious than Edward for the arrival of the intended bride; but the king employed a more effectual way than entreaty, by de spatching to Norway one of his ablest counsellors, Anthony Beck bishop of Durham, who, under the plausible name of pensions, distributed money among the Norwegian ministers, and obtained a promise, that she should immediately be sent to England.1 So par encheson de ly : e le Apostoylle ad grante, & fete dispensacion, solom coe ke communement est parle en diverses partys de Mound, ke le Fitz & le HeyT le Roy de Engletere pusse nostre dame, vostre fille, en femme prendre, nin ostaunt procheynette de Saunk. \" Nus, par commun assent de tut le Reaume de Escoce, e pur le grant profist del un & del autre Reaume, ke le mariage se face, si issint seit, avums uniement accorde, e communement assentu. \" Pur la queu chose nus priums & requerums vostre hautesse, ke il vous pleyse issint ordiner, e ceste bosoyne adrescer endroit de vous ; ke meyme cele voustre fille Dame puysse en Engletere venir a plus tous ke estre purra ; \" Issint ke, a plus tart, seit en meme la terre avaunt la tut Seynt procheyn avenir, si com, de sa venue, est acorde, devaunt le vaunt dyt Roys de Engletere, entre nous & voz messages, ke iloekes vyndrunt de par vus. \" Et taunt en facet, Sire, si vous plest, ke nous vous saums le plus tenu a tou Jurs ; ke, si il avenoyt ke vous ceste chose ne feisset, il nus covendroit, en ceste chose, prendre le meillour conseyl ke Deus nus dorra pur le estat du Reaume, & la bone gent de la terre. \" En temonage de les avauntdite choses nus, Gardeyns du Reaume, & la commune avantdyt, en nom de nus le Seal commun, que nus usom en Escoce, en nom de nostre Dame avaundyt, avum set mettre a ceste lettre. \" Done a Brigham, le Vendredy procheyn a pres la Feste Seynt Gregorie, le An de nostre Seygnur 1290.\" Rymer, vol. ii. p. 472.

He next appointed the Bishop of Durham, and five other plenipotentiaries, to attend a meeting of the Scottish estates, which was held at Brigham, (July 1290,) intrusting them with full powers to conclude that treaty, on the basis of which the marriage was to take place, and, after due conference, to concur in those securities which the Scottish estates demanded for the preservation of the independence of their country. The principal articles of this treaty of Brigham are of much importance, as illustrating the justice and the inveteracy of that long war, which afterwards desolated the kingdoms. It was agreed by the English plenipotentiaries, that the rights, laws, liberties, and customs of Scotland were to be inviolably observed in all time coming, throughout the whole kingdom and its marches, saving always the rights which the King of England, or any other person, has possessed, before the date of this treaty, in the marches or elsewhere ; or which may accrue to him in all time coming. It was stipulated also, that, failing Margaret and Edward, or either of them, without issue, the kingdom should belong to the nearest heirs, to whom it ought of right to return, wholly, freely, absolutely, and without any subjection ; so that nothing shall either be added to, or taken from, the rights of the King of England, of his heirs, or of any other person whatever. The queen, if she should survive her husband, was to be given up to the Scottish nation, free from all matri monial engagement ; and, on the marriage, to be secu red in a jointure befitting her rank. The kingdom of"], [85, "1290. INTERREGNUM. 79 Scotland was for ever to remain separate and undivided from England, free in itself, and without subjection, according to its ancient boundaries and marches. With regard to the ecclesiastical privileges of the country, it was provided that the chapters of churches, which possessed the right of free election, werenot to be compelled to travel forth of Scotland for leave to elect, or for the presentation of the bishop or dignitary, or for the performance of fealty to the sovereign. No crown-vassal, widow, orphan, or ward of the crown, was to be under the necessity of performing their ho mage or relief out of the kingdom, but a person was to be appointed in Scotland to receive the same, by the authority of the queen and her husband. From this clause was reserved the homage which ought to be performed in the presence of the king ; and fealty having been once sworn, sasine, or legal possession of the land, was immediately to be given by a brief from Chancery. It was anxiously and wisely provided, that no native of Scotland was, in any case whatever, to be compelled to answer out of the kingdom regarding any civil covenant or criminal delinquency which had taken place in Scotland, as such compulsion wTas contrary to the ancient laws and usages of the realm ; and that no parliament was to be held without the boundaries of the kingdom, as to any matters affecting the condition of its subjects. Until the arrival of the queen, the great seal of Scotland was to be used in all matters relating to God, the church, and the nation, as it had been used during the life and after the death of the late king ; and on the queen's arrival in her dominions, a new seal, with the ancient arms of Scotland alone, and the single name of the queen engraven thereon, was to be made, and kept by the chancellor ; it being"], [86, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1290. 80 also provided, that the chancellors, justiciars, cham berlains, clerks of the rolls, and other officers of the realm, were to be natives of Scotland, and resident there. All charters, grants, relics, and other muniments, touching the royal dignity of the kingdom of Scotland, were to be deposited in a safe place within that king dom, and to be kept in sure custody under the seals of the nobility, and subject to their inspection, until the queen should arrive, and have living issue ; and before this event took place, no alienation, encum brance, or obligation, was to be created in any matters touching the royal dignity of the kingdom of Scotland ; and no tallage, aids, levies of men, or extraordinary exactions to be demanded from Scotland, or imposed upon its inhabitants, except for the common affairs of the realm, or in the cases where the kings of Scotland have been wont to demand the same. It was pro posed by the Scots that the castles and fortresses should not be fortified anew upon the marches ; but the English commissioners, pleading the defect of their instructions, cautiously waved the discussion of this point. To all the articles in the treaty, the guardians and community of Scotland gave their full consent, under the condition that they should be ratified within a certain time.1 If not so confirmed, they were to be esteemed void; but Edward was too well satisfied with the terms of the negotiation to postpone this condition, and accordingly, without delay, pronounced the oath which was required. His next was one of those bold and unwarrantable steps, which frequently marked the conduct of this ambitious and able monarch. He 1 Before the feast of the Virgin's Nativity."], [87, "1290. INTERREGNUM. 81 pretended that, without the presence of an English governor, he could not fulfil the terms of his oath to maintain the laws of Scotland ; and although no such authority was given him by the treaty, he appointed Anthony Beck bishop of Durham to the office of Governor of Scotland, in the name of Margaret the queen, and his son Edward, and for the purpose of acting in concert with the regents, prelates, and nobles, in the administration of that kingdom, according to its ancient lawrs and usages.1 Edward had already gained to his interest two of the Scottish regents ; by this measure he trusted that he could overrule their deliberations; and, grown confident in his power, he intimated to the estates, \" that certain rumours of danger and perils to the kingdom of Scotland having reached his ears, he judged it right that all castles and places of strength in that kingdom should be de livered up to him.\" 2 This demand effectually roused the Scots ; and Sir William Sinclair, Sir Patrick Graham, and Sir John Soulis,3 with the other captains of the Scottish castles, peremptorily refused, in the name of the community of Scotland, to deliver its fortresses to any one but their queen and her intended husband, for whose be hoof they were ready to bind themselves by oath to keep and defend them. With this firm reply Edward was obliged to be satisfied ; and, sensible that he had overrated his influence, he patiently awaited the arrival of the young queen. It was now certain that she had sailed; the guardians of the realm, accompanied by commissioners from England, were preparing to receive her ; and all eyes, 1 Rymer, vol. ii. pp. 487, 488. s Ibid. p. 488.

F"], [88, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1290. 82 in both countries, were turned towards the sea, anxious to welcome the child on whom so many fair hopes depended, when accounts were brought that she had been seized with a mortal disease on her passage, and had died at Orkney. She was only in her eighth year. This fatal event, which may justly be called a great national calamity, happened in September 1290, and its first announcement struck sorrow and despair into the heart of the kingdom. In 1284, the crown had been solemnly settled on the descendants of Alexander the Third; but the parliament and the nation, confident in the vigorous manhood of the king, and the health of his progeny, had looked no farther. All was now overcast. The descendants of Alexander were extinct ; and Bruce and Baliol, with other noble earls or barons who claimed kindred with the blood royal, began, some secretly, some more boldly, to form their schemes of ambition, and gather strength to assert them. Previous to the report of the queen's death, a con vention of the Scottish estates had been held at Perth to receive Edward's answer to the refusal of deliver ing their castles. To this meeting of the estates, Robert Bruce lord of Annandale refused to come ; and a great part of the nobility made no concealment of their disgust at the arrogant and unprecedented demands of the English king.1 When the sad news was no longer doubtful, the miseries attendant on a contested throne soon began to show themselves. Bruce assembled a large force, and suddenly came to Perth. Many of the nobility declared themselves of his party, and the Earls of Mar and Athole joined him with all their followers. If the nation and its 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. ii. p. 1090."], [89, "1290. INTERREGNUM. 83 governors had been true to themselves, all might yet have gone well ; but the money and power of England had introduced other counsels. One of the guardians, William Fraser bishop of St Andrews, who had embraced the interests of Baliol, addressed a letter to Edward upon the first rumour of the queen's death, informing him of the troubled state of the country, and the necessity of his interposition to prevent the nation from being involved in blood. \" Should John de Baliol,\" says he, \"present himself before you, my counsel is, that you confer with him, so that, at all events, your honour and interest may be preserved. Should the queen be dead, wThich Heaven forefend, I entreat that your highness may approach our borders, to give consolation to the people of Scotland, to pre vent the effusion of blood, and to enable the faithful men of the realm to preserve their oath inviolable, by choosing him for their king who by right ought to be so.\" 1 Edward's mind was not slow to take full advantage of this unwise application;2 and the death of the young queen, the divisions amongst the Scottish nobility, and the divided state of the national mind as to the succession, presented a union of circumstances too favourable for his ambition to resist. The treaty of Brigham, although apparently well calculated to secure the independence of Scotland, contained a clause which was evidently intended to leave room for the pretended claim of the feudal superiority of Eng land over this country ; and even before the death of the Maid of Norway, Edward, in writs which he took 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. ii. p. 1090. s I have here availed myself of the criticisms of an acute writer in the Edinburgh Review, to modify my former censure of this prelate.\u2014 \"Edinburgh Review,\" No. 133.

His inter ference, indeed, had already been solicited by the Bishop of St Andrews ; there is reason also to suspect, from some mutilated and undated documents recently discovered, that Bruce and his adherents had not only claimed his protection at this moment, but secretly offered to acknowledge his right of superiority ; 2 but there is no authority for believing, that any national proposal was, at this time, made by the Scottish parliament, requesting his decision as arbiter, in a question upon which they only were entitled to pro nounce judgment. The motives of Edward's conduct, and the true history of his interference, are broadly and honestly stated, in these words of an old English historian : \" The King of England, having assembled his privy council and chief nobility, told them that he had it in his mind to bring under his dominion the 1 Prynne, Ed. I. p. 430-450. 2 I say \"suspect,\" because I cannot agree with the discoverer of these muniments, Sir Francis Palgrave, or with his reviewer, that the appeal of Bruce and the Earl of Mar to Edward, amounts to an absolute acknowledgment of his right as lord superior. As to Sir Francis Palgrave's fanciful theory, that there existed in the ancient kingdom of Scotland a constitutional body called \" The Seven Earls,\" possessing high privileges as a distinct estate, it is certainly singular that, if such a body did exist, there should not be found the slightest traces of its acts, or its appearance, from the dawn to the close of Scottish history. \u2014 See on this point the critique on Palgrave's \" Illus trations of Scottish History,\" in the Edinburgh Review, No. 133."], [91, "1290.

The English king opened the deliberations in a speech, delivered by his justiciary, Roger Brabazon, in which, after an introductory eulogium upon the godlike and regal attribute of justice, and the blessings attendant on the preservation of tranquillity, he ob served, that the sight of the great disturbances, which on the death of Alexander the Third had arisen in the kingdom of Scotland, was highly displeasing to him ; on this account, and for the purpose of satisfying those who had claims upon the crown, and for the confirma tion of peace in the land, he had requested its nobility to meet\" him, and had himself travelled from remote parts, that he might do justice to all, in his character of lord paramount, and without encroaching upon the rights of any man. \" Wherefore, \" concluded the justiciary, \" our lord the king, for the due accom plishment of this design, doth require your hearty recognition of his title of lord paramount of the kingdom of Scotland.\" 3 This unexpected demand struck dismay and embar- 1 Annales Waverleenses, p. 242.

They declared their entire ignorance that such a right of superiority belonged to the King of England ; and added, that at the present conjuncture, when the coun try was without its king, in whose presence such a challenge ought to be made, they could give no answer.1 \" By Holy Edward ! \" cried the King of England, \" whose crown I wear, I will either have my rights recognized, or die in the vindication of them ! \" \" And to make this speech good,\" says Hemingford, \" he had issued writs for the convocation of his army; so that, in case of his demand being resisted, he might conquer all opposition, were it to the death.\" ' The representatives of the estates of Scotland, who were well aware of this, now found themselves placed in trying circumstances, and requested time to consult and deliberate with their absent members. Edward at first would give them only one day ; but on their insisting that a longer interval was absolutely neces sary, the king granted them three weeks, to prepare all that they could allege against his pretensions. This delay the king well knew would be productive of some good consequences towards his great scheme, and, at any rate, could not possibly injure his ambitious views. Before these three weeks elapsed, his army would meet him at Norham. He had already ensured the services of Fraser the regent ; 3 and the money and promises which he judiciously distributed, had induced no less than ten competitors to come forward and claim the Scottish crown. In this way, by the brilliant prize which he held out to the most powerful of the nobility of Scotland, he placed their private 1 Walsingham, p. 56. 2 Hemingford, p. 33. 3 On August 13, 1291, Edward made a pilgrimage from Berwick to St Andrews, probably to consult with the bishop."], [93, "1291. INTERREGNUM. 87 ambition and their public virtue in fatal opposition to each other. All hoped that if they resigned to Edward this right of superiority, they might receive a kingdom in return ; and all felt, that to rise up as the defenders of the independency of a country, which was then torn by mutual distrust and civil disorder ; which was with out a king, without an army, and with the most powerful of its nobility leagued against it, would be a desperate undertaking against so able a general, so profound a politician, and so implacable an enemy, as Edward. I do not say this to palliate the disgraceful scene which followed, nor to insinuate that any circum stances can occur which entitle the subject of a free country to sacrifice its independence ; but to prove that the transaction, which was truly a deep stain upon our history, was the act not of the Scottish nation, or of the assembled states of the nation, but of a corrupted part of the Scottish nobility. To return to the story. On the 2d of June, eight of the competitors for the crown assembled, along with many of the prelates, nobles, and barons of Scotland, on a green plain called Holywell Haugh, opposite to Norham castle. These competitors were, \u2014 Robert Bruce, Florence earl of Holland, John Hastings, Patrick Dunbar earl of March, William de Ross, William de Vescy, Walter Huntercombe, Robert de Pynkeny, and Nicholas de Soulis. The Bishop of Bath and Wells, then chancellor of England, spoke for the king. He told them, that his master having on a for mer occasion granted them three weeks to prepare their objections to his claim of superiority, and they having brought forward no answer to invalidate his right, it was the intention of the King of England, in virtue of this acknowledged right, to examine and determine the dispute regarding the succession. The"], [94, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1291. 88 chancellor then turned to Robert Bruce, and demanded whether he was content to acknowledge Edward as lord paramount of Scotland, and willing to receive judgment from him in that character ; upon which this baron expressly answered, that he recognized him as such, and would abide by his decision. The same question was then put to the other competitors, all of whom returned the same answer. Sir Thomas Randolph then stood up, and declared that John Baliol lord of Galloway, had mistaken the day, but would appear on the morrow ; which he did, and then solemn ly acknowledged the superiority of the English king. At this fourth assembly, the chancellor protested in the name of the king, that although with the view of giving judgment to the competitors, he now asserted his right of superiority, yet he had no intention of ex cluding his hereditary right of property in the king dom of Scotland, but reserved to himself the power of prosecuting such right at whatever time, and in what ever way, he judged expedient.1 The king in person next addressed the assembly. He spoke in Norman-French ; recapitulated the pro ceedings ; and, with many professions of affection for the people of Scotland, declared his intention not only to pronounce a speedy decision in the controversy, but to maintain the laws and re-establish the tranquil lity of the country. John Comyn lord of Badenoch, called the Black Comyn, who had married a sister of Baliol, now came forward as a competitor for the crown, and acknowledged the superiority of Edward ; after which, the claimants affixed their signatures to two important instruments. The first declared, that, \" Forasmuch as the King of England has evidently 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. ii. p. 551."], [95, "1291. INTERREGNUM. 89 shown to us that the sovereign seigniory of Scotland, and the right of hearing, trying, and terminating our respective claims, belongs to him \u2014 we agree to receive judgment from him, as our lord paramount. We are willing to abide by his decision ; and consent that he shall possess the kingdom to whom he awards it.\" x By the second deed, possession of the whole land and castles of Scotland was delivered into the hands of EdwTard, under the pretence, that the subject in dis pute ought always to be placed in the hands of the judge ; but on condition that Edward should find se curity to make a full restitution within two months after the date of his award, and that the revenues of the kingdom should be preserved for the future sove reign. It was next determined, after grave consulta tion with the prelates and earls, that, in order to prepare the point in dispute for an ultimate decision, Baliol and Comyn for themselves, and the competitors who approved of their list, should choose forty \" dis creet and faithful men\" as commissioners; that Bruce, for himself, and the competitors who abided by his nomination, should choose other forty ; and that Ed ward, the king, should select twenty-four commis sioners, or, as he thought fit, a greater or lesser number. These commissioners were to meet in a body, to consi der the claims of the competitors, and to make their report to the king. On the 11th of June, the four regents of Scotland delivered the kingdom into the hands of Edward ; and the captains and governors of its castles, finding that the guardians of the realm, and the most powerful of its nobility, had abandoned it to its fate, gave up its fortresses to his disposal. And here, in the midst of 1 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 34. Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. ii. p. 529."], [96, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1291. 90 this scene of national humiliation, one Scottish baron stood forward, and behaved worthy of his country. The Earl of Angus, Gilbert de Umfraville, who com manded the important castles of Dundee and Forfar, declared, that having received these, not from England, but from the estates of Scotland, he would not sur render them to Edward. A formal letter of indemnity was then drawn up, which guaranteed the Earl of Angus from all blame ; and, in name of the claimants of the crown, and of the guardians of the realm, enjoined him to deliver the fortresses of which he held the keys. This removed the objection of Umfraville, and Dundee and Forfar were placed in the hands of Edward. The King of England, satisfied with this express acknowledgment of his rights as lord para mount, immediately redelivered the custody of the kingdom into the hands of the regents, enjoining them to appoint Alan bishop of Caithness, an Englishman, and one of his dependants, to the important office of chancellor ; and to nominate Walter Agmondesham, another agent of England, as his assistant. To the four guardians,'or regents, Edward next added a fifth, Bryan Fitz- Alan, an English baron ; and having thus secured an effectual influence over the Scottish councils, he proceeded to assume a generous and con ciliating tone. He promised to do justice to the competitors within the kingdom of Scotland,1 and to deliver immediate possession of the kingdom to the successful claimant ; upon the death of any king of Scotland who left an heir, he engaged to wave his claim to those feudal services, which, upon such an occasion, were rigidly exacted by lords superior in smaller fiefs, with the exception of the homage due to 1 Rymer, vol. ii. p. 532."], [97, "1291. INTERREGNUM. 91 him as lord paramount; but he stipulated, that, iu the event of a disputed succession occurring, the king dom and its castles were to be again delivered into his hands.1 The first act of this extraordinary drama now drew to a conclusion. The great seal, which had been brought from Scotland for the occasion, was delivered to the joint chancellors, the Bishop of Caithness and Walter Agmondesham. The four guardians, in the presence of a large concourse of English and Scottish nobility, swore fealty to Edward as lord superior; while Bruce lord of Annandale, with his son the Earl of Carrick, Johu de Baliol, the Earls of March, Mar, Buchan, Athole, Angus, Lennox, and Menteith, the Black Comyn lord of Badenoch, and many other barons and knights, followed them in taking the oaths of homage. A herald then proclaimed the peace of King Edward as lord paramount ; and the monarch added a protestation, that his consent to do justice in this great cause within Scotland, should not preclude him from his right of deciding in any similar emer gency within his kingdom of England. The assembly then broke up, after an agreement that its next meet ing should be at Berwick on the 2d of August, on which day the King of England promised to deliver his final judgment upon the succession to the crown of Scotland.2 It was now only the 13th of July, and Edward de termined to employ the interval till the 2d of August in a progress through Scotland, for the purpose of receiving the homage of its inhabitants, and examining in person the disposition of the people, and the strength of the country. He proceeded, by Edinburgh and 2 Ibid. vol. ii. p. 558. 1 Rymer, vol. ii. p. 601."], [98, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1291. 92 Stirling, as far as Perth, visiting Dunfermline, St Andrews, Kinghorn, and Linlithgow ; and at these places peremptorily called upon persons of all ranks, earls, barons, and burgesses, to sign the rolls of homage, as vassals of the King of England.1 In the more remote districts, which he could not visit, officers were appointed to receive the oaths, and enforce them by imprisonment upon the refractory ;2 and having thus examined and felt the temper of the country, which he had determined to reduce under his dominion, he returned to Berwick ; where, in the presence of the competitors, /with the prelates, earls, and barons of both countries, assembled in the chapel of the castle, he, on the 3d of August, opened the proceedings. First of all, he commanded the hundred and four commissioners of delegates to assemble in the church of the Dominicans, adjoining to the castle, and there receive the claims to the crown. Upon this, twelve competitors came forward. These were \u2014 I. Florence count of Holland, descended from Ada, the sister of King William the Lion. II.

This wTas an artful delay. Its apparent purpose was to give the commis sioners an interval of nine or ten months to institute their inquiries ; yet it served the more .important object of accustoming the nobility and people of Scot land to look to Edward as their lord paramount. When the parliament assembled at Berwick on the appointed day, and when Eric king of Norway appeared by his ambassadors, and insisted on his right to the crown of Scotland as the heir of his daughter Margaret, his petition and the claims of the first nine competitors were easily disposed of. They were liable to insuper- 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. ii. pp. 578, 579."], [100, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1292. 94 able objections: some on account of the notorious illegitimacy of the branches from which they sprung, which was the case with the Earl of March, along with the barons Nicholas de Soulis, William de Ross and De Vescy ; others were rejected because they affirmed that they were descendants of a sister of William the Lion, when the direct representatives of a brother of the same prince were in the field. Indeed, before the final judgment was pronounced, these frivolous competitors voluntarily retired. They had been set up by Edward, with the design of removing the powerful opposition which might have. arisen to his schemes, had they declared themselves against him ; and to excuse his delay in giving judg ment, by throwing an air of intricacy over the case. This object being gained, the king commanded the commissioners to consider, in the first place, the claims of Bruce and Baliol ; thus quietly overlooking the other competitors, whose rights were reserved, never to be again brought forward ; and virtually deciding that the crown must be given to a descendant of David earl of Huntingdon. The scene which followed was nothing more than a premeditated piece of acting, planned by Edward, and not ill performed by the Scottish commissioners, who were completely under his influence. The king first required them to make oath, that they would faithfully advise him by what laws and usages the question should be determined : they answered, that they differed in opinion as to the laws and usages of Scotland, and its application to the question before them ; and therefore required the assistance of the English commissioners, as if from them was to proceed more certain or accurate advice upon the law of Scotland. A conference with the commissioners of the two nations having taken place,"], [101, "1292. INTERREGNUM. 95 it was found that the differences in opinion were not removed. The English commissioners modestly re fused to decide until they were enlightened by the advice of an English parliament ; and the king, ap proving of their scruples, declared his resolution to consult the learned in foreign parts; and recommended all persons of both kingdoms to revolve the case in their minds, and consider what ought to be done. He then appointed a parliament to assemble at Berwick on the 15th of October; at which meeting of the estates he intimated he would pronounce his final decision. On the meeting of this parliament at the time ap pointed, Edward required the commissioners to give an answer to these two questions : 1st, By what laws and customs they ought to regulate their judgment ? or, in the event of there being either no laws for the determination of such a point, or if the laws of Eng land and Scotland happened to be at variance, what was to be done? And, 2d, Was the kingdom of Scotland to be regarded as a common fief, and the succession to the crown to be regulated by the same principles which were applicable to earldoms and baronies ? The commissioners replied, that the laws and usages of the two kingdoms must rule the ques tion ; but if none existed to regulate the case, the king must make a new law for a new emergency ; and that the succession to the Scottish crowm must be decided in the same manner as the succession to earldoms, baronies, and other indivisible inheritances. The king then addressed himself to Bruce and Baliol, and re quired them to allege any further arguments in explana tion of their right ; upon which they entered at great length into their respective pleadings upon the ques tion. Bruce insisted, that being the son of Isabella, second"], [102, "96 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1292. daughter of David earl of Huntingdon, he was next heir to the crown ; that Alexander the Second had so declared to persons yet alive, when the king despaired of having heirs of his own body; and that an oath had been taken by the people of Scotland to maintain the succession of the nearest in blood to Alexander the Third, failing the Maid of Norway and her issue. He maintained, that a succession to a kingdom ought to be decided by the law of nature, rather than by the principles which regulated the succession of vassals and subjects ; by which law, he, as nearest to the royal blood, ought to be preferred ; and that the custom of succession to the Scottish crown \u2014 by which the brother, as nearest in degree, excluded the son of the deceased monarch \u2014 supported his title. He contended that a woman, being naturally incapable of govern ment, ought not to reign ; and, therefore, as Devor guilla, the mother of Baliol, was alive at the death of Alexander the Third, and could not reign, the king dom devolved upon him, as the nearest male of the blood-royal. To all this Baliol replied, that as Alexander the Second had left heirs of his body, no conclusion could be drawn from his declaration; that the claimants were in the court of the lord paramount, of whose ancestors, from time immemorial, the realm of Scot land was held by homage ; and that the King of England must give judgment in this case as in the case of other tenements held of the crown, lookino- to 7 O the law and established usages of his kingdom ; that, upon these principles, the eldest female heir is pre ferred in the succession to all inheritance, indivisible as well as divisible, so that the issue of a younoer sister, although nearer in degree, did not exclude the issue of the elder, though in a degree more remote, the"], [103, "1292. INTERREGNUM. 97 succession continuing in the direct line. He main tained, that the argument of Bruce, as to the ancient laws of succession in the kingdom of Scotland, truly militated against himself; for the son was nearer in degree than the brother, yet the brother was preferred. He observed, that Bruce's argument, that a woman ought not to reign, was inconsistent with his own claim ; for if Isabella, the mother of Bruce, had no right to reign, she could transmit to him no claim to the crown ; and, besides all this, he had, by his own deliberate act, confuted the argument which he now maintained, having been one of those nobles who swore allegiance to Margaret, the Maiden of Norway. The competitors, Bruce and Baliol, having thus ad vanced their claims, King Edward required of his great council a final answer to the following question, ex horting the bishops, prelates, earls, barons, and com missioners, to advise well upon the point : \u2014 \" By the laws and customs of both kingdoms, ought the issue of an elder sister, but more remote by one degree, to exclude the issue of the younger sister, although one degree nearer ? \" To this the whole council unani mously answered, that the issue of the elder sister must be preferred ; upon which Edward, after affect edly entreating his council to reconsider the whole cause, adjourned the assembly for three weeks, and appointed it to meet again on Thursday the 6th of November. On this day, in a full meeting of all the competitors, the commissioners, and the assembled nobility of both countries, the king declared: that, after weighing Bruce's petition, with its circumstances, and deeply considering the arguments on both sides, it was his final judgment, that the pretensions of that noble per son to the Scottish crown must be set aside, and that VOL. I. G"], [104, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1292. 98 he could take nothing in the competition with Baliol. The great drama, however, was not yet concluded; for the king, having ordered the claims of Baliol and the other competitors, which were only postponed, to be further heard, Bruce declared that he meant to prosecute his right, and to present a claim for the whole or a part of the kingdom of Scotland, under a different form from what he had already followed. Upon this, John de Hastings, the descendant of the third daughter of David earl of Huntingdon, stood up, and affirmed that the kingdom of Scotland was par tible ; and ought, according to the established laws of England as to partible fiefs, to be divided equally amongst the descendants of the three daughters. This plea was founded upon an opinion of one of the French lawyers, whom Edward had consulted ; and Hastings had no sooner concluded, than Bruce again presented himself, and, adopting the argument of Hastings, claimed a third part of Scotland, reserving always to Baliol, as descended from the eldest sister, the name of king, and the royal dignity. Edward then put the question to his council, \" Is the kingdom of Scotland divisible ; or, if not, are its escheats or its revenues divisible ? \" The council answered, \" That neither could be divided.\" Upon which the king, after having taken a few days more to re-examine diligently^ with the assistance of his council, the whole of the petitions, appointed the last meeting for the hearing of the cause to be held in the castle of Berwick, on the 17th of November. On that great and important day, the council and parliament of England, with the nobility of both coun tries, being met, the various competitors were sum moned to attend ; upon which Eric king of Norway, Florence earl of Holland, and William de Vescy, with-"], [105, "1292. INTERREGNUM. 99 drew their claims. After this, Patrick earl of March, William de Ross, Robert de Pynkeny, Nicholas de Soulis, and Patrick Galythly, came forward in person, and followed the same course. John Comyn and Roger de Mandeville, who did not appear, were pre sumed to have abandoned their right ; and the ground being thus cleared for Edward's final judgment, he solemnly decreed : That the kingdom of Scotland being indivisible, and the King of England being bound to judge of the rights of his subjects according to the law7s and usages of the people over whom he reigns, by which laws the more remote in degree of the first line of descent is preferable to the nearer in degree of the second ; therefore, John Baliol ought to have seisin of the kingdom of Scotland, with reserva tion always of the right of the King of England and of his heirs, when they shall think proper to assert it. After having delivered judgment, Edward exhorted Baliol to be careful in the government of his people, lest by giving to any one a just cause of complaint, he should call down upon himself an interference of his lord paramount. He commanded the five regents to give him seisin of his kingdom, and directed orders to the governors of the castles throughout Scotland, to deliver them into the hands of Baliol.1 A humili- 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. ii. p. 590.

This ought to have been done by Duncan earl of Fife, but he was then a minor.

Edward's scheme for the subjugation of Scotland was not yet completed ; but all had hitherto succeeded to his wishes. He had procured the acknowledgment of a claim of superiority over that kingdom, which, if Baliol should refuse to become the creature of his ambition, gave him a specious title to compel obedience as lord paramount. By holding out the prospect of a crown to the various competitors, and by many rich grants of estates and salaries to the prelates and the nobility, he had succeeded in securing them to his interest -,1 and if any feelings of indignation, any spirit 1 This appears from the Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. p. 24, et passim.

Baliol had scarce taken possession of his kingdom when an event occurred which recalled him to a sense of his miserable subjection, and brought out the char acter of Edward in all its severity. It had been a special provision of the treaty of Brigham, that no Scottish subject was to be compelled to answer in any criminal or civil suit, without the bounds of the king dom ; but, in the face of this, Roger Bartholomew, a citizen of Berwick, entered an appeal to the King of England, from a judgment of those regents whom he had appointed in Scotland during the interregnum. Baliol was not slow to remind Edward of his solemn promise, to observe the laws and usages of Scotland ; and he earnestly protested against withdrawing any pleas from that kingdom to the courts of England.1 To this Edward replied, that he had in every article religiously observed his promise ; but that when com plaints were brought against his own ministers, who held their commissions from him as sovereign lord of Scotland, it was he alone who could have cognizance of them ; nor had his subjects therein any right to interpose. He then, with that air of apparent impar tiality which he often threw over his aggressions, changed his plan, and gave these barons and prelates gratifications in money or other value. But to John Comyn, the King of England gave the large sum of \u00a31563, 14s. 6id. \u2014 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. p. 17, 6th January, 1292.

JOHN BALIOL. 103 required the opinion of some of the ablest Scottish prelates and judges, with regard to the law and custom of their kingdom in one of the cases brought before him, and commanded his council to decide according to the judgment which they delivered.1 Irritated, however, by being reminded of the treaty of Brigham, he openly declared, by his justiciary Brabazon, that although, during the vacancy of the kingdom of Scot land, he had been induced to make promises which suited the time \u2014 now when the nation was ruled by a king, he did not intend to be bound by them, to the effect of excluding complaints brought before him from that kingdom, or of preventing him from dispensing justice and exercising the rights of his sovereign do minion, according to his power and pleasure. To give the greater weight to this imperious announcement, the King of England summoned Baliol and his prin cipal prelates and nobles into his privy chamber at Newcastle, and there made Brabazon repeat his reso lutions upon the matter in question ; after which, Edward himself rose up, and, in the French language, spoke to the same tenor. \" These are my firm deter minations,\" said he, \" with regard to all complaints or appeals brought before me from Scotland ; nor will I be bound by any former promises or concessions made to the contrary. I am little careful by what deeds or instruments they may be ratified : I shall exercise that superiority and direct dominion which I hold over the kingdom of Scotland, when and where I please ; nor will I hesitate, if necessary, to summon the King of Scotland himself into my presence within the kingdom of England.\"2 Baliol's spirit sunk under this declaration ; and he, 1 Ry ley's Placita, p. 145. 3 Rymer, Feed., vol. ii. p. 597.

On this being agreed to, Edward ordered the public records and ancient historical muniments of the king dom, which had formerly been transmitted from Edin burgh to Roxburgh, to be delivered to the King of Scotland. He also, out of special favour, commanded possession of the Isle of Man to be given to him ; * and, softened by these concessions, Baliol returned to his kingdom. But it was only to experience fresh mortification, and to feel all the miseries of subjec tion. The policy of Edward towards Scotland and its new king, was at once artful and insulting. He treated every assumption of independent sovereignty with rigour and contempt, and lost no opportunity of sum moning Baliol to answer before him to the complaints brought against his government ; he encouraged his subjects to offer these complaints by scrupulously ad ministering justice according to the laws and customs of Scotland ; and he distributed lands, pensions, and presents, with well-judged munificence, amongst the prelates and the nobility. The King of Scotland pos sessed large estates both in England and Normandy ; and in all the rights and privileges connected with them, he found Edward certainly not a severe, almost an indulgent superior. To Baliol the vassal, he was 1 Edward, in 1290, when Margaret was alive, had taken under hi\u00bb protection her kingdom of Man, at the request of its inhabitants. \u2014 Rymer, vol. ii. p. 492."], [111, "1292. JOHN BALIOL. 105 uniformly lenient and just:1 to Baliol the king, he was proud and unbending to the last degree. An example of this soon occurred. The Earl of Fife died, leaving his son, Duncan, a minor, and the earldom to the protection of the Bishop of St Andrews. Macduff, the grand-uncle of Duncan, then seized it ; but being ejected by the bishop, on complaining to Edward, was, at the king's command, restored to his estates by the sentence of the Scottish regents. When Baliol held his first parliament at Scone,2 Macduff was summoned to answer for his having taken forcible possession of lands, which, since the death of the last earl of Fife, were in the custody of the king. He attempted a defence ; but being found guilty, suffered a short imprisonment. On his release, he was not slow to carry his appeal to the King of England ; and Edward immediately summoned Baliol to answer in person before him, to the allegations of Macduff.3 To this order Baliol paid no regard, and Edward again commanded him to appear. This was not all. He procured his parliament to pass some regulations regarding the attendance of the King of Scots, which, from their extreme severity, seem to have been expressly intended to exasperate this monarch, who found that, in every case of appeal, he was not only to be dragged in as a party, but that his personal attendance was to be rigidly exacted. The first was a grievous, the last an intolerable burden, to which no one with even the name of a king could long submit.4 Meanwhile, dissembling his chagrin, he appeared in the English parliament held after Michaelmas, where Macduff was also present. When the cause of this 1 Rymer, vol. ii. p. 635. 2 Winton, vol. ii. p. 73. 3 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. ii. p. 606. Fordun a Hearne, p. 968. 4 Ryley's Placita, p. 151.

To the complaint of Macduff, or to any matters respecting my kingdom, I dare not make an answer without the advice of my people.\" \u2014 \" What means this refusal?\" cried Edward. \"Are you not my liegeman ; have you not done homage to me ; is it not my summons that brings you here ?\" To this im- petuous interrogation the Scottish monarch firmly answered, \" Where the business respects my kingdom, I neither dare, nor can answer, in this place, without the advice of my people.\"1 An artful proposal was then made by Edward, that, in order to consult with his people, he should adjourn giving his final reply to a future day ; but this he peremptorily declined, de- claring that he would neither name a day, nor con- sent to an adjournment. Under these circumstances, the English parliament proceeded to pronounce judg- ment. They declared that the King of Scotland was guilty of open contempt and disobedience. He had, they said, offered no defence, but made a reply which went to elude and weaken the jurisdiction of his liege lord, in whose court as a vassal he had claimed the crown of Scotland. In consequence of which they advised the King of England, not only to do full justice to Macduff, and to award damages against Baliol ; but, as a punishment for his feudal delinquency, to seize three of his principal castles in Scotland, to remain in the hands of the English monarch until he should make satisfaction for the injury offered to his lord superior.2 Before this judgment of the parliament was publicly made known, Baliol presented himself to Edward, and thus addressed him : \" My lord, I am 1 Ryley's Placita, p. 158.

After having advised with them, I will, in your first parliament after Easter, report the result, and perform what is my duty.\" It was evident that the resolutions of the parlia ment were unnecessarily violent, and could not have been carried into effect without the presence of an army in Scotland. The King of England, aware of this, and dreading to excite a rebellion, for which he was not then prepared, listened to the demand of Baliol, and delayed all proceedings until the day after the feast of the Trinity, in 1294.1 Not long after this, Edward, who was a vassal of the King of France for the duchy of Aquitaine, be came involved with his lord superior, in a quarrel similar to that between himself and Baliol. A fleet of English vessels belonging to the Cinque Ports, had encountered and plundered some French merchant ships ; and Philip demanded immediate and ample satisfaction for the aggression. As he dreaded a war with France, Edward proposed to investigate, by commissioners, the causes of quarrel ; but this seemed too slow a process to the irritated feelings of the French king ; and, exerting his rights as lord superior, he summoned Edward to appear in his court at Paris, and there answer, as his vassal for the injuries which 1 Ryley's Placita, pp. 152, 160. Prynno's Edward I., p. 554."], [114, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1293. 108 he had committed. This order was, of course, little heeded ; upon which Philip, sitting on his throne, gave sentence against the English king; pronounced him contumacious, and directed his territories in France to be seized, as forfeited to the crown.1 Edward soon after renounced his allegiance as a vassal of Philip ; and, with the advice of his parliament, declared war against France. To assist him in this war, he summoned Baliol, and others of the most powerful of the Scottish nobles, to attend him in person with their armed vassals ; but his insolent and overbearing conduct had entirely dis gusted the Scots. They treated his summons with scorn; and, instead of arming their vassals for his assistance, they assembled a parliament at Scone.2 Its first step was, under the pretence of diminishing the public charges, to dismiss all Englishmen from Baliol's court ; and having thus got rid of such trouble some spies upon their measures, they engaged in a treaty of alliance with France,3 and determined upon war with Edward. Many estates in Scotland were at this time held by English barons, and many also of the most powerful of the Scottish nobility possessed lands in England. Anxious for a general union against the common enemy, the Scottish estates in the hands of English barons were forfeited, and their proprietors banished ; while those Scottish nobles who remained faithful to Edward had their lands seized and forfeited.4 In this way Robert Bruce lost his rich lordship of Annaudale.

Edward, although enraged at the conduct of the Scottish parliament, and meditating a deep revenge, was at this time harassed by a rebellion of the Welsh, and a war with France. Dissimulation and policy were the weapons to which he had recourse, whilst he employed the interval which he gained in sowing dissension among the Scottish nobles, and collecting an army for the punishment of their rebellion. To Bruce, the son of the competitor for the crown, whose mind was irritated by the recent forfeiture of his estates, he affected uncommon friendship ; regretted his decision in favour of the now rebellious Baliol ; declared his determination to place him on the throne, of which the present king had shown himself unworthy ; and directed him to inform his numerous and powerful friends in Scotland of this resolution.1 Bruce either trusted to the promises, or was intimi dated by the power of Edward. Besides this, Comyn earl of Buchan, who now mainly directed the Scottish councils, was his enemy, and held violent possession of his lordship of Annandale. To join with him was impossible ; and accordingly this powerful baron and his son, afterwards king, with Dunbar earl of March, and Umfraville earl of Angus, repaired to Edward, and renewed to him their oaths of homage.2 The undecided character of Baliol was ill calculated to remove this disunion amongst the Scottish nobles; and the party who then ruled in the Scottish parlia ment, dreading a submission upon the part of their king, secluded him from all power, confined him in a moun- 1 Fordun a Hearne, p. 971 . 3 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 102."], [116, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1295. 110 tain fortress, and placed the management of affairs in the hands of twelve of the leading nobles.1 The measures adopted by these guardians were de cided and spirited. They, in the name of the King of Scots, drew up an instrument, renouncing all fealty and allegiance to Edward, on account of the many and grievous injuries committed upon his rights and pro perty as King of Scotland.2 They despatched ambas sadors to France, who concluded a treaty of marriage and alliance, by which the niece of Philip, daughter of Charles count of Valois, was to be united to the eldest son of Baliol3 \u2014 the French king engaging to assist the Scots with troops kept at his own charges ; and they assembled an army under the command of Comyn earl of Buchan, which invaded Cumberland.4 This expedition, however, returned without honour, having been repulsed in an attempt to storm Carlisle. Nothing could be more favourable for Edward than the miserably disunited state of Scotland. He knew that three powerful factions divided the country, and hindered that firm political union, without which, against such an enemy, no successful opposition could be made. Bruce, and his numerous and powerful fol lowers, adhered to England. The friends of Baliol, and that part of the nation which recognized him for their sovereign, beheld him a captive in one of his own fortresses, and refused to join the rebels who had im prisoned him ; and the party of Comyn, which had invaded England, were either so destitute of military talent, or so divided amongst themselves, that a hand ful of the citizens of Carlisle compelled them to retreat with loss into their own country. These advantages, the result of his own able and artful policy, were easily 1 Math. Westminst. p. 425. 2 Fordun a Hearne, p. 969. 3 F\u0153dera, vol. ii. p. 696. 4 Hemingford, p, 87.

It was now his time for action, and for inflicting that vengeance upon his enemies, which, with this monarch, the longer it was delayed, was generally the more sure and terrible. He assembled a numerous and well-appointed army. It consisted of thirty thousand foot, and four thousand heavy-armed horse. He was joined by Beck, the war like Bishop of Durham, at the head of a thousand foot and five hundred horse ; and with this combined force, and the two sacred banners of St John of Beverley and St Cuthbert of Durham carried before the army,1 he marched towards Scotland. It appears, that some time before this, Edward had thought proper to grant a prolongation of the term agreed on for the decision of the question of Macduff, and had required Baliol to attend him as his vassal at Newcastle-upon-Tyne.2 On arriving there, he summoned the King of Scot land ; and after waiting a few days for his appearance, advanced to the eastern border, and crossed the Tweed with his main army below the nunnery of Coldstream. On the same day the Bishop of Durham forded the river at Norham ; and the whole army, marching along the Scottish side, came before the town of Berwick, then in the hands of the Scots.3 Edward wTas determined, at all sacrifices, to make himself master of this city.

The king summoned it to surrender, and offered it terms of accom modation, which, after two days' consideration, were refused. Edward, upon this, did not immediately proceed to storm, but drew back his army to a field near a nunnery, about a mile from the town, and where, from the nature of the ground, he could more easily conceal his dispositions for the attack. He then despatched a large division, with orders to assault the town, choosing a line of march which concealed them from the citizens ; and he commanded his fleet to enter the river at the same moment that the great body of the army, led by himself, were ready to storm.2 The Scottish garrison fiercely assaulted the ships, burnt three of them, and compelled the rest to retire ; 3 but they, in their turn, were driven back by the fury of the land attack. Edward himself, mounted on horse back,4 was the first who leaped the dike ; and the soldiers, animated by the example and presence of their king, carried every thing before them. All the horrors of a rich and populous city sacked by an inflamed soldiery, and a commander thirsting for ven geance, now succeeded. Seventeen thousand persons,5 without distinction of age or sex, were put to the sword ; and for two days the city ran with blood like 1 Torf\u00e6us, book i. chap, xxxii.

The churches, to which the miserable inha bitants had fled for sanctuary, were violated and de filed with blood, spoiled of their sacred ornaments, and turned into stables for the English cavalry.1 In the midst of this massacre a fine trait of fidelity occurred. The Flemings at this period carried on a lucrative and extensive trade with Scotland, and their principal factory was established in Berwick. It was a strong building, called the Red-hall, which by their charter, they were bound to defend to the last extre mity against the English. True to their engagements, thirty of these brave merchants held out the place against the whole English army. Night came, and still it was not taken. Irritated by this obstinate courage, the English set it on fire, and buried its faith ful defenders in the burning ruins.2 The massacre of Berwick, wThich took place on Good Friday, was a terrible example of the vengeance which Edward was ready to inflict upon his enemies. Its plunder enriched his army, and it never wholly recovered its commercial importance and prosperity. Sir William Douglas, who commanded the castle, after a short defence surren dered, and swore fealty to the King of England : and its garrison, after taking an oath not to bear arms against that country, were allowed to march out with military honours.3 Whilst Edward remained at Berwick, engaged in throwing up new fortifications against future attacks, Henry abbot of Arbroath, attended by three of his monks, appeared at his court, and delivered to him the instrument containing Baliol's renunciation of his homage. \" You have,\" said the Scottish King, \" wan- 1 Fordun, book xi. chap. liv. lv. 3 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 91 .

Wherefore, I renounce that fealty and homage, which have been extorted from me ; and do resolve openly to oppose myself, in defence of my kingdom, against Edward of England.\"1 Edward received this letter with angry contempt. \"The senseless traitor!\" said he; \" of what folly is he guilty ! But since he will not come to us, we will go to him!\"2 Enraged at the dreadful vengeance inflicted on Ber wick, the Scottish army, under the Earls of Ross, Menteith, and Athole, made a second inroad into England ; and, imitating the example of Edward, with merciless severity ravaged Redesdale and Tynedale, carrying away a great booty, and sparing neither sex nor age.3 The flames of towns and villages, and the ashes of the ancient monasteries of Lanercost and Hexham, marked their destructive progress ; but the vengeance of the Scots was short-lived, and their plans unconnected. That of their enemy was the very oppo site : it was deep-laid in its plans, simultaneous in its movements, and remorseless in its contemplation of consequences.

Its lord, Patrick earl of Dunbar, served in the army of Edward ; but his wife, the countess, who held the castle, and hated the English, entered into a secret negotiation with the Scottish leaders, for its delivery into the hands of her countrymen. The Earls of Ross, Athole, and Menteith,the barons John Comyn, William Sinclair, Richard Seward, and John de Mow bray, with thirty -one knights, and a strong force, threw themselves into the place ; and, assisted by the coun tess, easily expelled the few soldiers who remained faithful to England.1 On being informed of this loss, Edward determined upon recovering it at all hazards ; and for this purpose despatched the Earl of Surrey with ten thousand foot, and a thousand heavy-armed horse. When summoned by Warrene, the garrison agreed to surrender, unless relieved within three days ; and the Scots, anxious to retain so important a place, led on the whole of their army, and possessed them selves of a strong and excellent position on the high ground above Dunbar. Forty thousand foot and fifteen hundred horse encamped on the heights, near Spot ; and, confident of rescue, the garrison of the castle insulted the English from the walls, as if already beaten.2 On the first appearance of the Scottish army, Surrey steadily advanced to attack it. On approaching the high ground, it was necessary to deploy through a valley; and the Scots imagined they observed some confusion in the English ranks, when executing this movement. Mistaking this for flight, they precipi tately abandoned their strong position on the hills, and rushed down with shouts upon the enemy. Mean- 1 Walsingham, p. 67.

The Scots, ruined, as they had often been, by their temerity, perceived their fatal error when it was too late. Instead of an enemy in flight, they found an army under perfect discipline, advancing upon their broken and disordered columns ; and having in vain endeavoured to regain their ranks, after a short resistance they were completely routed. Three hundred and fifty years after this, Cromwell, on the same ground, defeated the army of the Scottish Covenanters, which occupied the same admirable posi tion, and with equal folly and precipitancy deserted it. Surrey's victory was complete, and for the time decided the fate of Scotland. Ten thousand men fell on the field, or in the pursuit. Sir Patrick de Graham, one of the noblest and wisest of the Scottish barons, disdained to ask for quarter, and was slain in circum stances which extorted the praise of the enemy.1 A great multitude, including the principal of the Scottish nobility, were taken prisoners ; and, next day, the King of England coming in person with the rest of his army before Dunbar, the castle surrendered at discretion. The Earls of Athole, Ross, and Menteith, with four barons, seventy knights, and many other brave men, submitted to the mercy of the conqueror.2 All the prisoners of rank were immediately sent in chains to England, where they were for the present committed to close confinement in different Welsh and English castles.3 After some time, the king compelled them to attend him in his wars in France ; but even this partial liberty was not allowed them, 1 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 96.

Return ing from Lothian, he sat down before the castle of Roxburgh, which was surrendered to him by James, the Steward of Scotland, who not only swore fealty and abjured the French alliance,2 but prevailed upon many others of the Scottish nobility to forsake a struggle which w?as deemed desperate, and to submit to England. It was at his instigation that Ingelram de Umfraville surrendered the castle of Dunbarton,3 and gave up to Edward his daughters, Eva and Isobel, as hostages. Soon after, the strong fortress of Jed burgh was yielded to his mercy ; 4 and his victorious army being reinforced by a body of fifteen thousand men from Wales, he was enabled to send home that part of his English force, which had suffered most from fatigue in this expedition. With these fresh levies he advanced to Edinburgh ; made himself master of the castle after a siege of eight days ; 5 passed rapidly to Stirling, which he found abandoned ; and while there, the Earl of Ulster, with a new army of thirty thousand foot and four hundred horse, came to join the king, and complete the triumph of the English arms. The monarch continued his progress without opposition to Perth, where he halted to keep the feast of the nativity of John the Baptist, with circumstances of high feudal solemnity, regaling his friends, creating new knights, and solacing him- 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. sub Ed.

This was none other than that of an absolute resignation of himself and his kingdom to the mercy of his conqueror ; to which Baliol, now the mere shadow of a king, without a crown, an army, or a nobility, dejectedly submitted. In presence of the Bishop of Durham, and the barons of England, he was first stript of his royal robes ; after which they spoiled him of his crown and sceptre, and compelled him, standing as a criminal, with a white rod in his hand, to perform a humiliating feudal penance.2 He confessed, that, misled by evil counsel and his own weakness, he had grievously offended his liege lord ; he recapitulated his various transgressions, his league with France, and his hostilities against England ; he acknowledged the justice of the invasion of his kingdom by Edward, in vindication of his violated rights ; and three days after this, in the castle of Brechin, he resigned his kingdom of Scotland, its people and their homage, into the hands of his liege lord Edward, of his own free will and consent.3 After this humiliating ceremony, Baliol delivered his eldest son, Edward, to the King of England, as a hostage for his future fidelity ; and this youth, along with his discrowned father, were soon after sent by sea to 1 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 98. 3 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 167.

But Edward, with a policy not dis similar to that which we have adopted in our Eastern dominions, had succeeded in preventing all union amongst the most powerful Scottish barons, by array ing their private and selfish ambition against the love of their country; by sowing dissension in their councils, richly rewarding their treachery, and treating with unmitigated severity those who dared to love and de fend the liberty of Scotland ; and Baliol's character was not of that high stamp, which could unite such base and discordant materials, or baffle a policy so deep, and a powrer so overwhelming.

On his return from the north to hold his parliament at Berwick, in passing the ancient abbey of Scone, he took with him the famous and fatal stone upon which, for many ages, the Scottish kings had been crowned and anointed. This, considered by the Scots as their national palladium, along with the Scottish sceptre andcrown, the English monarch placed in the cathedral of Westminster, as an offering to Edward the Confessor, and a memorial of what he deemed his absolute conquest of Scotland ;x a conquest, however, which, before a single year had elapsed, was entirely wrested from his hands. Edward was desirous of annihilating every thing which could preserve the patriotic feeling of the coun try which he had overrun. With this object, when at Scone, he mutilated the ancient chartulary of that abbey, the historical notices in which were perhaps fatal to his pretended claim of superiority, carrying off some of its charters, and tearing the seals.2 Our historians affirm, that in his progress he industriously sought out and destroyed every monument connected with the antiquity and independence of the nation. The character of Edward, and his conduct at Scone, give great probability to the assertion.3 On the 28th of August, the king held his parlia ment at Berwick, for the purpose of receiving the fealty of the clergy and laity of Scotland.

Edward next directed his attention to the settle ment of his new dominions ; and the measures which he adopted for this purpose were equally politic and just. He commanded the sheriffs of the several coun ties in Scotland to restore to the clergy their forfeited lands; and he granted to the Scottish bishops for ever, the privilege of bequeathing their effects by will, as fully as the right was enjoyed by the prelates of England. The widows of those barons whose hus bands had died before the French alliance, and who had not since then been married to the king's enemies, 1 Ragman Rolls, printed by Bannatyne Club, 1834. 2 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. ii. p. 714."], [128, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1296. 122 were faithfully restored to their estates ; but, effectually to secure their allegiance, the English guardian of Scotland was permitted, at his option, to take posses sion of the castles and strengths upon their lands. He even assigned pensions to the wives of many of his Scottish prisoners ; and few of those who held office under the unfortunate Baliol were dispossessed. The jurisdictions of Scotland were suffered to remain with those who possessed them, under ancient and heredi tary titles ; no wanton or unnecessary act of rigour was committed, no capricious changes introduced, yet all means were adopted to give security to his con quest.

Edward had scarcely made this settlement of Scot land, and set out for his own dominions, when he found that, instead of the acclamations due to a conqueror, he was to be received at home with the louring coun tenances of discontent and rebellion. He had incurred a heavy expense in his Scottish expedition, and he was now anxious to carry on with vigour his war with France ; but the clergy of England, headed by a proud and firm prelate, Winchelsea archbishop of Canter bury, demurred as to the supplies which he demanded ; and a powerful party of the barons, led by the Con stable and the Marshal of England, refusing to pass over into France, indignantly retired from parliament, with a great body of their armed retainers. These discontents in England encouraged the people of Scotland to rise against their English oppressors. Although deserted by their nobility, a spirit of deter mined hatred against England was strongly manifested by the great body of the nation. Throughout the whole country, numerous bands of armed peasants infested the highways, and in contempt of government plundered the English, and laid waste their lands. Their numbers increased, and their successes soon be came alarming. They besieged the castles garrisonfed by the English, took prisoners, committed all kinds of rapine and homicide ; and the impression made upon the mind of Edward may be judged of by a letter still remaining, addressed to his treasurer Cressingham, commanding him not to scruple to spend the whole money in his exchequer to put down these violent disorders. x 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, 25 Edward I., vol. i. p. 42."], [130, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1297. 124 The patriotic principle, which seems at this time to have entirely deserted the highest ranks of the Scottish nobles, whose selfish dissensions had brought ruin and bondage upon their country, still burned pure in the breasts of these broken men and rebels, as they are termed by Edward. The lesser barons, being less contaminated by the money and intrigues of England, preserved also the healthy and honest feelings of na tional independence ; and it happened, that at this time, and out of this middle class of the lesser barons, arose an extraordinary individual, who, at first driven into the field by a desire to avenge his individual in juries, within a short period of time, in the reconquest of his native country, developed a character which may, without exaggeration, be termed heroic. This was William Wallace, or Walays, the second son of Sir Malcolm Wallace of Ellerslie, near Paisley, a knight whose family was ancient, but neither rich nor noble.1 In those days bodily strength and knightly prowess were of the highest consequence in commanding respect and ensuring success. Wallace had an iron frame. His make, as he grew up to man hood, approached almost to the gigantic ; and his personal strength was superior to the common run of even the strongest men. His passions were hasty and violent; a strong hatred to the English, who now insolently lorded it over Scotland, began to show itself at a very early period of his life ; and this aversion was fostered in the youth by an uncle, a priest, who, deploring the calamities of his country, was never weary of extolling the sweets of liberty, and lament ing the miseries of dependence.2 1 Winton's Chron. vol. ii. p. 91, book viii. chap. xiii.

PERIOD OF WALLACE. 125 The state of national feeling in Scotland at this time has been already described; and it is evident, that the repressing of a rising spirit of resistance, which began so strongly to show itself, required a judi cious union of firmness, gentleness, and moderation. Upon the part of the English all this was wanting. Warrene, the governor, had, on account of ill health, retired to the north of England. Cressingham, the treasurer, was a proud, ignorant ecclesiastic. Ed ward, before he departed, had left orders that all who had not yet taken the oath of fealty, including not only the lesser barons but the burghers and inferior gentry, should be compelled to do so under severe penalties, exacted by military force ; and Ormesby, the justiciary, had excited deep and general odium, by the intolerable rigour with which these penalties were extorted. The intrepid temper of Wallace appears first to have shown itself in a quarrel, in the town of Lanark, with some of the English officers who insulted him. This led to bloodshed ; and he would have been over powered and slain in the streets, had it not been for the interference of his mistress, to whose house he fled, and by wThose assistance he escaped to the neigh bouring woods. In a spirit of cruel and unmanly revenue, Hislop, the English sheriff, attacked the house, and put her to death ; for which he was him self assaulted and slain by Wallace.1 The consequence of this was to him the same as to many others, who at this time preferred a life of dangerous freedom to the indulgence and security of submission.2 He was proclaimed a traitor, banished his home, and driven to seek his safety in the wilds and fastnesses of his 1 Winton,vol.ii. p. 95. book viii. chap. xiii.

It was here that he collected by degrees a little band, composed at first of a few brave men of desperate fortunes, who had forsworn their vassalage to their lords, and refused submission to Edward, and who at first carried on that predatory warfare against the English, to which they were impelled as well by the desire of plunder, and the necessity of subsistence, as by the love of liberty. These men chose Wallace for their chief. Superior rank \u2014 for as yet none of the nobility or barons had joined them \u2014 his uncommon courage and personal strength, and his unconquerable thirst of vengeance against the English, naturally influenced their choice ; and the result proved how well it had fallen. His plans were laid with so much judgment, that in his first attacks against straggling parties of the English, he was generally successful ; and if surprised by unexpected numbers, his superior strength and bravery, and the ardour with which he inspired his followers, enabled them to overpower every effort which was made against them. To him these early and desultory excursions against the enemy were highly useful, as he became acquainted with the strongest passes of his country, and acquired habits of command over men of fierce and turbulent spirits. To them the advantage was reciprocal, for they began gradually to feel an undoubting confidence in their leader; they were accustomed to rapid marches, to endure fatigue and privation, to be on their guard against surprise, to feel the effects of discipline and obedience ; and, by the successes which these ensured, to regard with contempt the nation by whom they had allowed themselves to be overcome. The consequences of these partial advantages over the enemy were soon seen. At first few had dared to unite themselves to so desperate a band. But confi-"], [133, "1297. PERIOD OF WALLACE. 127 dence came with success, and numbers flocked to the standard of revolt. The continued oppressions of the English, the desire of revenge, and even the romantic and perilous nature of the undertaking, recruited the ranks of Wallace, and he was soon at the head of a great body of Scottish exiles.1 When it was known that this brave man had raised open banner against the English, Sir William Douglas,2 who had been taken by Edward at the siege of Ber wick, and restored to his liberty upon swearing fealt}7, disregarding his oath, joined the Scottish force with his numerous vassals. Ormesby, the English justi ciary, was at this time holding his court at Scone ; and Surrey, the guardian, had gone to attend the English parliament. Wallace, by a rapid march, surprised the justiciary, dispersed his followers, and, whilst he himself escaped with the greatest difficulty, took a rich booty and many prisoners.3 This exploit giving new confidence to their little army, they more openly and boldly ravished the country, and put all Englishmen to the sword. As circumstances allowed, they either acted together, or engaged in separate expeditions. Whilst Wallace marched into Lennox, the castles of Disdeir and Sanquhar were taken by Douglas ; and when their united strength afterwards broke in upon the west of Scotland, they were joined by some of the most powerful of the Scottish nobility. The Steward of Scotland, and his brother, Sir Andrew Moray of Bothwell, Alexander de Lindesay, and Sir Richard Lundin, with a spirited prelate, Wishart bishop of Glasgow, were amongst the number.4 1 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 118.

Their revenge seems especially to have been directed against the English ecclesiastics who were possessed of Scottish livings. A public edict, passed by the Scottish estates in 1296, had banished these intruders from Scotland ; and this edict Wallace, it is said, improved upon with a refinement in cruelty. Some aged priests, and it is even asserted, although almost too horrid to believe, some helpless women, had their hands tied behind their backs, and, in this helpless state, were thrown from high bridges into rivers, their dying agonies affording sport to their merciless captors.1 The conduct of the younger Bruce, afterwards the heroic Robert the First, was at this period vacillating and inconsistent. His large possessions in Carrick and Annandale made him master of an immense tract of country, extending from the Firth of Clyde to the Solway ; and the number of armed vassals which his summons could call into the field, would have formed an invaluable accession to the insurgents. His power caused him to be narrowly watched by England ; and as his inconstant character became suspected by the wardens of the western marches, they summoned him to treat on the affairs of his master the king at Carlisle. Bruce, not daring to disobey, resorted thither with a numerous attendance of his friends, and was compelled to make oath on the consecrated host, and the sword of Thomas-a-Becket, that he would continue 1 Hen.

To give a proof of his fidelity, he ravaged the estates of Sir William Douglas, then with Wallace, seized his wife and chil dren, and carried them into Annandale. Having thus defeated suspicion, and saved his lands, he privately assembled his father's retainers ; talked lightly of an extorted oath, from which the pope would absolve him ; and urged them to follow him, and join the brave men who had taken arms against the English. This, however, they refused, probably because their master and overlord, the elder Bruce, was then with Edward. Robert, however, nothing moved by the disappointment, collected his own tenants, marched to join Wallace, and openly took arms against the English.1 The news of this rebellion reached the King of Eng land, as he was preparing to sail for Flanders. He at first disregarded it ; and as many of the most powerful of the Scottish nobles were then either prisoners in England, or in attendance upon himself, and ready to embark for the continent, he was easily persuaded that it would be instantly put down by the authority of the governor. Anthony Beck, however, the martial Bishop of Durham, was despatched in great haste into Scotland; and Edward finding, from his account, that the revolt was of a serious nature, commanded the Earl of Surrey to call forth the military force on the north of the Trent, and, without delay, to reduce the insur gents.2 This, however, was no easy matter. Stewy sent his nephew, Henry Percy, before him into Scotland, at the head of an army of forty thousand foot, and three hundred armed horse. Percy marched through 1 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 120.

It was very dark, and Percy's men knew not where to rally. In this emergency they set fire to the wooden houses where they lay, and, guided to their banners by the blaze, repulsed the enemy, and marched towards Ayr,1 for the purpose of receiving the men of Galloway to the peace of the king. It was here told them that the Scottish army Was not four miles distant ; and Percy, having struck his tents, advanced at the first break of the morning to Irvine, and soon discovered their squadrons drawn up nearly opposite to him, on the border of a small lake. This force, which equalled the English in foot, although inferior in horse, was sufficient, under able conduct, to have given battle to Percy, but it was enfeebled by dissension amongst its leaders ; and although Wallace was there to direct them, the pride of these feudal barons would not submit to be commanded by him. Accordingly, most of these chiefs became anxious to negotiate terms for themselves, and to save their lands. Sir Richard Lundin, a Scottish knight, who had till now refused allegiance to Edward, went over with his followers to the army of Percy, declaring it to be folly to remain longer with a party at variance with itself. At the same time, Bruce, the Steward of Scotland, and his brother Alexander de Lindesay, Sir William Dou glas, and the Bishop of Glasgow, made submission to Edward, and entreated his forgiveness for the robberies and slaughters which they had committed. An instru ment, commemorating this desertion of their country, to which their seals were appended, was drawn up in Norman-French ;2 but Wallace treated all proposals of ' Hen.

Although the greater nobles had deserted the cause, he knew that many of their vassals were enthusiastically attached to his person and fortunes.1 He could muster also a large body of his own tried and veteran followers; and putting himself at the head of these, he retired indig nantly to the north. Sir Andrew Moray of Bothwell was the only baron who accompanied him. The conduct of the Scottish nobility, who had capi- tulated to Percy, was irresolute and contradictory. Edward had accepted their offers of submission ; but although they would not act in concert with Wallace, whose successes had now effectually raised the spirit of the nation, they drew back from their agreement with Percy, and delayed the delivery of their hostages, until security should be given them for the preserva- tion of the rights and liberties of their country. Sir William Douglas and the Bishop of Glasgow, however, considered that they were bound to abide by the capi- tulation signed at Irvine ; and finding themselves unable to perform their articles of agreement, they voluntarily surrendered to the English.2 It was the fate of this last-mentioned prelate to be trusted by neither party. Wallace, whose passions were fiery and impetuous, loudly accused him of treachery, attacked his castle, ravaged his lands, and led his servants and family captive ; wThilst the King of England declared that, under this surrender of himself at the castle of Roxburgh, a purpose was concealed of betraying that important fortress to the Scots.3 Notwithstanding has read the concluding sentence of this deed erroneously, as has been shown by Sir F. Palgrave. The words which he prints as \" Escrit a Sire Willaume,\" are \" Escrit a Irwine.\" 1 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 125. 3 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 124. Tyrrel, Hist.

In Aberdeenshire, especially, the revolt was serious; and Edward directed his writs to the bishop and sheriffs of the county, commanding them to punish the rebels for the murders and robberies which they had been committing, and to be on their guard against an intended attack upon the castle of Urquhart, then held by William de Warrene.1 What were the particular successes of Wallace and his brethren in arms, during the summer months which elapsed between the treaty at Irvine and the battle of Stirling, we have no authentic memorials to determine.2 That they had the effect of recruiting his army, and giving him the confidence of the body of the people of Scotland, is certain ; for Knighton, an old English historian, informs us, \" that the whole followers of the nobility had attached themselves to him ; and that although the persons of their lords were with the King of England, their heart was with Wallace, who found his army reinforced by so im mense a multitude of the Scots, that the community of the land obeyed him as their leader and their prince.\"3 Edward, in the meantime, dissatisfied with the dilatory conduct of Surrey, in not sooner putting down a revolt, which the king's energetic and confident spirit caused him to treat too lightly, superseded him, and appointed Brian Fitz-Alan governor of Scotland. At the same time he liberated from their imprison ment in various castles through England, the Scottish nobles and barons taken at the battle of Dunbar, and carried them along with him to Flanders. Their for- 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. pp. 41, 42. 2 From 9th July to 3d September. 3 Knighton, apud Twysden, p. 2516."], [139, "1297. PERIOD OF WALLACE. 133 feited lauds were restored ; but to secure their fidelity, the king compelled their eldest sons to remain in England as hostages.1 Others of the Scottish nobles, whose fidelity was less suspected, were permitted to return home, under a promise of assisting in the re duction and pacification of the country ; and as many of the most powerful and warlike English barons as he could spare from his expedition to Inlanders, were directed to repair to Scotland, with all the horse and foot which they could muster, and to co-operate with Fitz-Alan and Surrey.2 Having taken these precau tions, King Edward passed over to Flanders on the 22d of August.3 It was fortunate for the Scots, that Warrene the Earl of Surrey, evinced great remissness in insisting on the fulfilment of the treaty of Irvine. He was on bad terms with Cressingham the treasurer, a proud and violent churchman, who preferred the cuirass to the cassock ; 4 and it is probable, that his being super- seded in his government of Scotland, and yet com- manded to remain with the army, was an indignity which so high a baron could ill brook.8 The conse- quences of this inactivity were soon apparent. The Scottish barons still delayed the delivery of their hostages, and cautiously awaited the event of the war ; whilst Wallace, at the head of a powerful army, having succeeded in expelling the English from the castles of Forfar, Brechin, Montrose, and nearly all their strongholds on the north of the Forth, had just begun the siege of the castle of Dundee, when he re ceived intelligence that the English army, under the 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, pp. 44, 45.

Well ac quainted with the country there, his military skill taught him of what importance it would be to secure the high ground on the river Forth, above Cambus kenneth, before Surrey had passed the bridge at Stirling ; and having commanded the citizens of Dun dee, on pain of death, to continue the siege of the castle, he marched with great expedition, and found, to his satisfaction, that he had anticipated the English, so as to give him time to choose the most favourable position for his army, before the columns of Cressing ham and Surrey had reached the other side of the river. The nature of the ground concealed the Scottish army, which amounted to forty thousand foot, and one hundred and eighty horse. Wallace's intention was to induce the main body of the English to pass the bridge, and to attack them before they had time to form. Surrey was superior in numbers. He com manded a force of fifty thousand foot soldiers, and one thousand armed horse. Lord Henry Percy had marched from Carlisle towards Stirling, with a rein forcement of eight thousand foot and three hundred horse ; but Cressingham the treasurer, dreading the expense of supporting so great a force, had, with an ill-judged economy, given orders for the disbanding these succours, as he considered the army in the field to be sufficient for the emergency.1 The Steward of Scotland, the Earl of Lennox, and others of the Scottish barons, were at this time with the English army ; and on coming to Stirling, requested Surrey to delay an attack till they had attempted to Hemingford, p. 127."], [141, "1297. PERIOD OF WALLACE. 135 bring Wallace to terms. They soon returned, and declared that they had failed in their hopes of pacifi cation, but that they themselves would join the English force with sixty armed horse. It was now evening, and the Scottish barons, in leaving the army, met a troop of English soldiers returning from forage. Whether from accident or design, a skirmish took place between these two bodies, and the Earl of Len nox stabbed an English soldier in the throat. This, of course, raised a tumult in the camp ; a cry arose that they were betrayed by the Scots ; and there seems to be little doubt that Lennox and his friends were secretly negotiating with Wallace, and only waited for a favourable opportunity of joining him. Crying out for vengeance, the English soldiers carried their wounded comrade before their general, and reproached him with having trusted those who had broken their faith, and would betray them to the enemy. \" Stay this one night,\" said he, \" and if to-morrow they do not keep their promise, you shall have ample revenge.\" He then commanded his soldiers to be ready to pass the bridge next day : and thus, with a carelessness little worthy of an experienced commander, who had the fate of a great army dependent on his activity and foresight, he permitted Wallace to tamper with his countrymen in the English service ; to become ac quainted with the numbers and array of the English force ; and to adopt, at his leisure, his own measures for their discomfiture. Early next day, five thousand foot and a large body of the Welsh passed the bridge by sunrise, and soon after repassed it, on finding that they were not followed by the rest of the army, and that the Earl of Surrey was still asleep in the camp. After an hour the earl awoke, the army was drawn up, and as was then usual"], [142, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1297. 136 before any great battle, many new knights were created, some of whom were fated to die in their first field. It was now the time when the Scottish barons ought to have joined with their sixty horse ; and Surrey, having looked for them in vain, commanded the infantry to cross the bridge. This order was scarcely given when it was again recalled, as the Steward of Scotland and the Earl of Lennox were seen approaching, and it was hoped, brought offers of pacification. But the contrary was the case. They had failed, they said, in all their efforts to prevail on the Scottish army to listen to any proposals, and had not been able to persuade a single soldier to desert. As a last resource, Surrey, who seems to have been aware of the strong position occupied by the Scots, and of the danger of crossing the river, despatched two friars to propose terms to Wallace, who made this memorable reply : \u2014 \" Return to your friends, and tell them that we came here with no peaceful intent, but ready for battle, and determined to avenge our. own wrongs and set our country free. Let your masters come and attack us : we are ready to meet them beard to beard.\" 1 Incensed at this cool defiance, the Eng lish presumptuously and eagerly demanded to be led on ; upon which, Sir Richard Lundin, a Scottish knight, who had gone over to the enemy at Irvine, anxiously implored them to be still : \" If,\" said he, \" you once attempt to pass the bridge, you are despe rately throwing away your lives. The men can only cross two by two. Our enemies command our flank, and in an instant will be upon us. I know a ford not far from hence where you may pass by sixty at a time. Give me but five hundred horse, and a small body of Hemingford, vol. i. p. 126."], [143, "1297. PERIOD OF WALLACE. 137 soot, I shall turn the enemy's flank, whilst you, lord earl, and the rest of the army, may pass over in secu rity.\" This was the sound advice of a veteran soldier who knew the country ; but although it convinced some, it only irritated others, and among these last, Hugh Cressingham the treasurer. \" Why, my lord,\" cried he to Surrey, who was prudently hesitating, \" why do we protract the war, and spend the king's money ? Let us pass ou as becomes us, and do our duty.\" J Stung with this reproach, Surrey weakly submitted his better judgment to the rashness of this churchman, and commanded the army to defile over the bridge. Sir Marmaduke Twenge, a knight of great experience and courage, along with Cressingham himself, led the van ; and when nearly the half of the army had passed the bridge, perceiving that the Scots kept their strong ground on the heights, Twenge, with chivalrous impe tuosity, gave orders for a charge, and made the heavy armed cavalry spur their horses up the hill. The consequence of this precipitate movement was fatal to the English. A part of the Scottish army had by this time made a circuit and possessed themselves of the foot of the bridge ;2 and Wallace, the moment that he saw the communication between the van and the rear of the English force thus cut off, and all retreat impossible, rushed rapidly down from the high ground, and attacking Twenge and Cressingham, before they 1 \" Minim dictu,\" exclaims Hemingford, in an animated reflection on the madness of Surrey's conduct, \" sed terribile, quid in eventu, quod tot et tanti discreti viri dum scirent hostes impromptu, strictum pon tem ascenderint, quod bini equestres, vix et cum difficultate simul transire potuerunt.\" Hemingford, vol. i. p. 128. 3 Hemingford, 128. \u2014 \" Descenderunt de monte, et missis viris lan ceariis occupaverunt pedera pontis, ita quod extunc nulli patebat transitus vel regressus.\" See, also, Walsingham, p. 73."], [144, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1297. 138 had time to form, threw them into inextricable dis order. In an instant all was tumult and confusion. Many were slain ; multitudes of the heavy-armed horse plunged into the river, and were drowned in making a vain effort to rejoin Surrey, who kept on the other side, a spectator of the discomfiture of the flower of his army. In the meantime, the standard-bearers of the king, and of the earl, with another part of the army, passed over, and shared the fate of their com panions, being instantly cut to pieces. A spirited scene now took place. Sir Marmaduke Twenge, on looking round, perceived that the Scots had seized the bridge, and that he and his soldiers were cut off from the rest of the army. A knight advised, in this perilous crisis, that they should throw themselves into the river, and swim their horses to the opposite bank. \" What,\" cried Twenge, \" volunteer to drown myself, when I can cut my way through the midst of them, back to the bridge ? Never let such foul slander fall on us!\" So saying, he put spurs to his horse, and driving him into the midst of the enemy, hewed a passage for himself through the thickest of the Scottish columns, and rejoined his friends, with his nephew and his armour-bearer, in perfect safety. Meanwhile the Scots committed a dreadful slaughter. It is the remark of the historian Hemingford, who describes this victory of Stirling from the information of eye-witnesses, that in all Scotland there could not be found a place better fitted for the defeat of a power ful army by a handful of men, than the ground which Wallace had chosen.1 Multitudes perished in the river ; and as the confusion and slaughter increased, and the entire defeat of the English became inevitable, 1 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 128."], [145, "1297. PERIOD OF WALLACE. 139 the Earl of Lennox and the Steward of Scotland, who, although allies of the King of England, were secretly in treaty with Wallace, threw off the mask, and led a body of their followers to destroy and plunder the flying English. Surrey, on being joined by Sir Marmaduke Twenge, remained no longer on the field ; but having hastily ordered him to occupy the castle of Stirling, which he promised to relieve in ten days, he rode, without drawing bridle, to Berwick : a clear proof of the total defeat of the powerful army which he had led into Scotland. From Berwick he proceeded to join the Prince of Wales in the south, and left the country, which had been intrusted to him, exposed to ravage and desolation. Although the English his torians restrict the loss of soldiers in this fatal and important battle to five thousand foot, and a hundred heavy-armed horse,1 it is probable that nearly one half of the English army was cut to pieces ; and Cres singham the treasurer was amongst the first who fell. Hemingford allows, that the plunder which fell into the hands of the Scots was very great, and that wagons were filled with the spoils. Smarting under the cruelty and rapacity with which they had been treated by the English, the Scots were not slow now to take their revenge ; nor was Wallace of a temper to restrain his soldiers. Few prisoners seem to have fallen into their hands, and the slaughter was general and indis criminate. So deep was the detestation in which the character of Cressingham was regarded, that his dead 1 So say Hemingford and Knighton. But Trivet, p. 307, and Walsingham, p. 73, assert, that before the half of the English army had passed, the Scots attacked, and put almost all of them to the sword.

See Notes and Illustra tions, letter H."], [146, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1297. 140 body was mangled, the skin torn from the limbs, and in savage triumph cut into pieces.1 The decisive nature of the defeat is, perhaps, most apparent, from the important consequences which attended it. To use the words of Knighton, \" This awful beginning of hostilities roused the spirit of Scot land, and sunk the hearts of the English.\" 2 Dundee immediately surrendered to Wallace, and rewarded his army by a rich booty of arms and money. In a short time not a fortress or castle in Scotland remained in the hands of Edward. The castles of Edinburgh and Roxburgh were dismantled ; and Berwick, upon the advance of the Scottish army, having been hastily abandoned, Wallace sent Henry de Haliburton, a Scottish knight, to occupy this important frontier town.3 Thus, by the efforts of a single man, not only unassisted, but actually thwarted and opposed by the nobility of the country, was the iron power of Edward completely broken, and Scotland once more able to lift her head among free nations. A dreadful dearth and famine, no unfrequent accom paniment of the ravages of war, now fell severely upon the country ; and Wallace, profiting by the panic inspired by his victory at Stirling, resolved upon an immediate expedition into England.4 To enable his own people to lay in, against the time of scarcity, the provisions which would otherwise be consumed by his numerous army, and to support his soldiers during 1 Triveti Ann. p. 307.

Previous, however, to his marching into England, he commanded, that from every county, barony, town, and village, a certain proportion of the fighting men, between sixteen and sixty, should be levied. These levies, however, even after so decisive a victory as that of Stirling, were tardily made. The vassals of Scotland, tied up by the rigid fetters of the feudal law, could not join Wallace without the autho rity of their overlords ; and as most of the Scottish nobility had left hostages for their fidelity in the hands of Edward, and many of them possessed great estates in England, which, upon joining Wallace, would have immediately been forfeited, they did not yet dare to take the field against the English. A jealousy, too, of the high military renown and great popularity of Wallace, prevented all cordial co-operation ; and the contempt with which this deliverer of his country must have regarded the nobility, who yet sheltered themselves under the protection of Edward, was not calculated to allay this feeling. The battle of Stirling was fought on the 11th of September; and on the 25th of that month the English government, alarmed at the success of Wallace, sent letters to the principal Scottish nobility, praising them for their fidelity to the king ; informing them that they were aware the Earl of Surrey was on his way to England, (a delicate way of noticing the flight of Warrene from Stirling;) and directing them to join Brian Fitz-Alan, the governor of Scotland, with all their horse and foot, in order to put down the rebellion of the Scots. The only nobles with whom the English government did not communicate, were the Earls of Caithness, Ross, Mar, Athole, Fife, and Carrick. Fife, however, was"], [148, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1297. 142 a minor ; the others, we may presume, had by this time joined the party of Wallace.1 The great majority of the nobles being still against him, this intrepid leader found it difficult to procure new levies, and wras constrained to adopt severe mea sures against all who were refractory. Gibbets were erected in each barony and county town ; and some burgesses of Aberdeen, who had disobeyed the sum mons, were hanged.2 After this example, he soon found himself at the head of a numerous army ; and having taken with him, as his partner in command, Sir Andrew Moray of Bothwell, then a young soldier of great promise, and afterwards regent of the king dom, he marched towards the north of England, and threatened Northumberland.3 Such was the terror inspired by the approach of the Scots, that the whole population of this county, with their wives and chil dren, their cattle and household goods, deserted their dwellings, and took refuge in Newcastle. The Scots, to whom plunder was a principal object, delayed their advance ; and the Northumbrians, imagining the danger to be over, returned home ; but Wallace, informed of this by his scouts, made a rapid march across the border, and dreadfully ravaged the two counties of Cumberland and Northumberland, carrying off an immense booty, and having the head-quarters of his army in the forest of Rothebury. \" At this time,\" 1 John Comyn of Badenoch ; Patrick earl of Dunbar ; Umfraville earl of Angus ; Alexander earl of Menteith ; Malise earl of Strathern ; James the Steward of Scotland ; John Comyn earl of Buchan ; Malcolm earl of Lennox; and William earl of Sutherland ; Nicholas de la Haye ; Ingelram de Umfraville ; Richard Fraser, and Alexander de Lindesaye; were the nobles written to by the English government.

PERIOD OF WALLACE. 143 says Hemingford, \" the praise of God was unheard in any church and monastery through the whole country, from Newcastle-upon-Tyne to the gates of Carlisle ; for the monks, canons regular, and other priests, who were ministers of the Lord, fled, with the whole people, from the face of the enemy ; nor was there any to oppose them, except that now and then a few English, who belonged to the castle of Alnwick, and other strengths, ventured from their safe-holds, and slew some stragglers. But these were slight successes ; and the Scots roved over the country from the feast of St Luke to St Martin's day,1 inflicting upon it all the miseries of unrestrained rapine and bloodshed.\" 2 After this, Wallace assembled his whole army, and proceeded in his destructive march to Carlisle. He did not deem it prudent, however, to attack this city, which was strongly garrisoned ; and contented him self with laying waste the district of Allerdale in Cumberland, from Inglewood forest to Derwentwater and Cockermouth.3 It was next determined to invade the county of Durham, which would have been easily accomplished, as three thousand foot and a hundred armed horse were all that could be mustered for its defence. But the winter now set in with great seve rity. The frost was so intense, and the scarcity of provisions so grievous, that multitudes of the Scots perished by cold or famine, and Wallace commanded a retreat. On returning to Hexham, where there was a rich monastery, which had already been plundered and deserted on the advance, a striking scene occurred. Three monks were seen in the solitary monastery. Thinking that the tide of war had passed over, they 1 From 18th October to 11th November. 3 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 132. 3 Fordun a Hearne, p. 980."], [150, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1297. 144 had crept back, to repair the ravages it had left, when suddenly they saw the army returning, and fled in terror into a little chapel. In a moment the Scottish soldiers, with their long lances, were upon them, call- ing, on peril of their lives, to show them the treasures of their monastery. \" Alas !\" said one of the monks, \"it is but a short time since you yourselves have seized our whole property, and you know best where it now is.\" At this moment Wallace himself came into the chapel, and, commanding his soldiers to be silent, requested one of the canons to celebrate mass. The monk obeyed ; and Wallace, all armed as he was, and surrounded by his soldiers, reverently attended. When it came to the elevation of the host, he stepped out of the chapel to cast off his helmet and lay aside his arms ; but in this short absence the fury and avarice of his soldiers broke out. They pressed on the priest, snatched the chalice from the altar, tore away its ornaments and the sacred vestments, and even stole the missal in which the service had been begun. When their master returned, he found the priest in horror and dismay, and gave orders that the sacrile- gious wretches who had committed the outrage, should be sought for and put to death. Meanwhile, he took the canons under his protection. \" Remain with me,\" said he ; \" it is that alone which can secure you. My soldiers are evil disposed. I cannot justify, and I dare not punish them.\"1 This sacrilegious attack was the more unpardonable, as the monastery of Hexham was dedicated to the patron saint of Scotland, and enjoyed a perpetual protection from King David. Wallace, to atone for the outrage, granted a charter of protection to the priory and convent, by which its 1 Hemingford, vol. i. pp. 133, 134. Knighton, p. 2521."], [151, "1297. PERIOD OF WALLACE. 145 lands, men, and moveables, were admitted under the peace of the king, and all persons interdicted from doing them injury.1 The Scots now advanced to New castle, but finding the garrison prepared to stand a siege, they contented themselves with ravaging the adjacent country ; and having collected the booty, they allotted their part to the Galwegians who were with the army, and marched homewards.2 In revenge for this terrible visitation, Lord Robert Clifford collected the strength of Carlisle and Cum berland, and twice invaded Annandale with an army of twenty thousand foot and a hundred horse. On passing the Solway, it was proclaimed by sound of trumpet that every soldier should plunder for himself, and keep his own booty; on hearing which, the in fantry, with undisciplined rapacity, dispersed, and the horse alone remained together. In consequence of this, nothing was effected worthy of so powerful an army. Three hundred and eight Scots were slain, ten villages, or hamlets, burnt, and a few prisoners taken. This happened at Christmas. In his second inroad, the town of Annan and the church of Gysborne, were burnt and plundered.3 Annandale belonged to Robert Bruce ; and the destruction of his lands and villages determined him once more to desert the Eng lish, and join the party of the patriots. Soon after his return from his expedition into England, Wallace, in an assembly held at the Forest 1 This famous instrument is granted in name of \" Andrew de Moray, and William Wallace, leaders of the army of Scotland, in the name of the illustrious prince, John, by the grace of God, King of Scotland, and with consent of the estates of the kingdom.\" It is dated at Hex ham, on the 8th of November, 1297.

He conferred the office of Constable of Dundee upon Alexander Skirmishur, or Scrimgeour, and his heirs, for his services in bearing the royal banner of Scotland.3 By a strict severity, he re strained the licentiousness of his soldiers, and endea voured to introduce discipline into his army.4 In order to secure a certain proportion of new levies, at any time when the danger or exigency of the state required it, he divided the kingdom into military dis tricts. In each shire, barony, lordship, town, and burgh, he appointed a muster-book to be made, of the number of fighting men which they contained, between 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 174.

In a short time, such were the effects of his firm and courageous dealing in the government, that the most powerful of the nobility were compelled, by the fears of imprisonment, to submit to his authority, although they envied him his high elevation, and, whenever an opportunity presented itself, took part with the King of England.2 But although few of the earls had joined him, the lesser barons and gentry repaired in great numbers to the banner of the governor, and willingly supported him with all their forces. The general revolt of the Scots, and that rapid success with which it was attended, determined the English regency to summon a parliament at London, on the 10th of October.3 To this assembly came the Earl of Norfolk and the Earl of Hereford, the one Marshal and the other Constable of England, with so powerful a body of their retainers, that they overawed its proceedings ; and aware of the trying emergency in which the rebellion of the Scots had placed the king, they declared, that no aids or levies should be granted against the Scots,, unless the Great Charter, and the Charter of the Forests, were ratified, along with an additional clause, which prohibited any aid or tallage from being exacted, without the consent of the prelates, nobles, knights, and other freemen. Edward was startled wThen informed of these demands. His affairs detained him in Flanders, where accounts had reached him of the whole of Scotland having been 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 170. 3 \" Et si quis de magnatibus gratis suis non obediret mandatis, hunc tenuit et coercuit, et custodi\u00e6 mancipavit, donee suis bene placitis penitus obtemperaret.\" Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 170. 3 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 138."], [154, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1298. 148 wrested from his hand by Wallace : he was still en gaged in a war with France ; and, thus surrounded by difficulties, it was absolutely necessary for him to make every sacrifice to remain on good terms with his barons.1 He, accordingly, after three days' deliberation, con sented to confirm all the charters which had been sent over to him ; and having wisely secured the affections of his nobility, he directed letters to the earls and barons of England, commanding them, as they valued his honour, and that of the whole kingdom, to meet at York on the 14th January, and thence, under the orders of the Earl of Surrey, to proceed into Scotland, and put down the rebellion of that nation.2 At the same time he sent letters to the great men of Scotland, requiring them on their fealty to attend the muster at York, and denouncing them as public enemies if they refused. These seasonable favours granted to the nobility, and the good grace with which Edward bestowed them, although, in truth, they were extorted from him much against his inclination, rendered the king highly popular ; so that at York, on the day appointed, there was a great muster of the military force of the king dom. There came the Earl Marshal and the Great Constable of England, the Earl of Surrey the king's lieutenant against the Scots, the Earls of Gloucester and Arundel, Lord Henry Percy, John de Wake, John de Segrave, Guido son of the Earl of Warwick, and many other powerful earls and barons.3 Having waited in vain for the Scottish nobles whom Edward had summoned to attend \u2014 an order which, as the 1 Tyrrel, Hist.

Here they accordingly met, and the army, both in numbers and equipment, was truly formidable. There were two thousand heavy cavalry, armed, both horse and man, at all points, along with two thousand light horse, and a hundred thousand foot, including the AVelsh. With this force they marched across the border, and advanced to Roxburgh. This important fortress, which appears to have been recovered and rebuilt by the English, since its capture by Wallace 1 in the former year, was again invested by Wallace ; and the garrison, worn out by a long siege, were in a state of great distress, when the army of Surrey made its appearance, and the Scots thought it prudent to retire. After relieving \" their wounded countrymen,\" the English skirmished as far as Kelso, and returned to occupy Berwick, which had been in the hands of the Scots since the battle of Stirling. They found it deserted, and brought a joyful relief to the castle, the garrison of which had stoutly held out, whilst the rest of the town was in possession of the enemy.2 Edward, in the meantime, having learnt in Flanders the strength of the army which awaited his orders, was restless and impatient till he had joined them in person. His anger against the Scots, and his deter mination to inflict a signal vengeance upon their perfidy on again daring to defend their liberties, had induced him to make every sacrifice, that he might proceed with an overwhelming force against this 1 Supra, p. 140. 2 Knighton, p. 2525.

For this purpose, he hastened to conclude a truce with the King of France, and to refer their disputes to the judgment of Boniface the pope.1 He wrote to the Earl of Surrey not to march into Scot land till he had joined the army in person ; and having rapidly concluded his affairs in Flanders, he took ship ping, and landed at Sandwich, where he was received with much rejoicing and acclamation.2 Surrey, on receiving letters from the king to delay his expedition, had retained with him a small proportion of his troops, and dismissed the rest ; but the moment Edward set his foot in England, he directed his writs, by which he summoned the whole military power of the kingdom to meet him at York, on the feast of Pentecost, with horse and arms, to proceed against the Scots.3 He also commanded all the earls and barons, with two knights of every shire, and the representatives from the towns and burghs, to attend his parliament to be held in that city ; and summoned the nobility of Scot laud, unless they chose to be treated as vassals who had renounced their allegiance, to be there also on the day appointed.4 To this summons they paid no regard. Those who had accompanied him in his expe dition to Flanders, on his embarkation for England, forsook him, and resorted to the French king ; and the rest of the Scottish barons, although jealous of Wallace, dreaded the vengeance which his power and high authority as governor entitled him to inflict on 1 Rymer's F\u0153dera, new edit. vol. i. part ii. p. 887. 3 Ibid. p. 889. 3 Tyrrel, vol. iii. p. 129.

Meanwhile Edward, having commanded his army to rendezvous at Roxburgh on the 24th of June, with misplaced devotion, made a pilgrimage to the shrine of St John of Beverley. The sacred standard of this saint, held in deep reverence by the king and the army, had been carried with the host in the former war ; and it is probable EdwTard would not lose the opportunity of taking it along with him in this expe dition. On coming to Roxburgh, he found himself at the head of an army more formidable in their number, and more splendid in their equipment, than even that which had been collected by the Earl of Surrey six months before. He had seven thousand horse, three thousand heavy-armed, both men and horse, and four thousand light cavalry. His infantry consisted at first of eighty thousand men, mostly Welsh and Irish ; but these were soon strengthened by the arrival of a powerful reinforcement from Gascony, amongst whom were five hundred horse, splendidly armed, and admir ably mounted. On reviewing his troops, Edward found that the Constable and Marshal, with the barons of their party, refused to advance a step until the confirmation of the Great Charter, and the Charter of the Forests, had been ratified by the king in person : so jealous were they of their new rights, and so sus picious lest he should plead, that his former consent, given when in foreign parts, did not bind him within his own dominions.1 Edward dissembled his resent ment, and evaded their demand, by bringing forward the Bishop of Durham, and the Earls of Surrey, Norfolk, and Lincoln, who solemnly swore, on the soul of their lord the king, that on his return, if he obtained 1 Hemingford, p. 159."], [158, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1298. 152 the victory, he would accede to their request.1 Com pelled to rest satisfied with this wary promise, which he afterwards tried in every way to elude, the refrac tory barons consented to advance into Scotland. Meanwhile that country, notwithstanding the late expulsion of its enemies, was little able to contend with the superior numbers and discipline of the army now led against it. It was cruelly weakened by the con tinued dissensions and jealousy of its nobility. Ever since the elevation of Wallace to the rank of Governor of Scotland, the greater barons had envied his assump tion of power ; and, looking upon him as a person of ignoble birth, had seized all opportunities to despise and resist his authority.2 These selfish jealousies were increased by the terror of Edward's military renown, and in many by the fear of losing their Eng lish estates ; so that at the very time when an honest love of liberty, and a simultaneous spirit of resistance could alone have saved Scotland, its nobility deserted their country, and refused to act with the only man whose success and military talents were equal to the emergency. The governor, however, still endeavoured to collect the strength of the land. John Comyn of Badenoch, the younger, Sir John Stewart of Bonkill, Sir John Graham of Abercorn, and Macduff the grand uncle of the Earl of Fife, consented to act along with him ; whilst Robert Bruce, maintaining a suspicious neutrality, remained with a strong body of his vassals in the castle of Ayr. The plan adopted by Wallace for the defence of Scotland, was the same as that which was afterwards 1 \" Quod in reditu,\" suo, obtenta victoria, \" omnia perimpleret ad votum.\" Hemingford, p. 159. 2 \" Licet apud comites regni et proceres ignobilis putaretur.\" For dun a Hearne, p. 978.

It wras to avoid a general battle, which, with an army far inferior to the English, must have been fought at a disadvantage ; to fall back slowly before the enemy, leaving some garri sons in the most important castles, driving off all supplies, wTasting the country through which the Eng lish were to march, and waiting till the scarcity of provisions compelled them to retreat, and give him a favourable opportunity of breaking down upon them with full effect. Edward had determined to penetrate into the wTest of Scotland, and there he purposed to conclude the wTar. He directed a fleet with supplies for his army, to sail round from Berwick to the Firth of Forth ; and having left Roxburgh, he proceeded by moderate marches into Scotland, laying waste the country, and anxious for a sight of his enemies. No one, however, was to be found, who could give him information regarding the Scottish army ; and he pro ceeded through Berwickshire, to Lauder,1 and without a check to Templeliston, now Kirkliston, a small town between Edinburgh and Linlithgow. Here, as provi sions began already to be scarce, he determined to remain, in order to receive the earliest intelligence of his fleet ; and, in case of accidents, to secure his retreat. At this time he learnt that frequent attacks were made against the foraging parties of his rear division, by the Scottish garrison in the strong castle of Dirleton ; and that two other fortalices, which he had passed on his march, were likely to give him annoyance.2 Upon this he despatched his favourite martial bishop, Anthony Beck, who sat down before the castle ; but, on account of the want of proper battering machines, found it too strong for him. He then attempted to carry it by 1 Prynne, Edward I, p. 788. 3 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 160."], [160, "1298. 154 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. assault, but was driven back with loss ; and as his division began to be in extreme want, the bishop sent Sir John Marmaduke to require the king's pleasure. \" Go back,\" said Edward, \" and tell Anthony that he is right to be pacific, when he is acting the bishop, but that in his present business he must forget his calling. As for you,\" continued the king, addressing Marmaduke, \" you are a relentless soldier, and I have often had to reprove you for too cruel an exultation over the death of your enemies ; but return now whence you came, and be as relentless as you choose. You will have my thanks, not my censure ; and, look you, do not see my face again, till these three castles are razed to the ground.\" 1 In the meantime, the besiegers were relieved from the extremities of want, by the arrival of three ships with provisions ; and the bishop, on receiving the king's message, took advantage of the renewed strength and spirits of his soldiers, to order an assault, which was successful ; the garrison having stipulated, before sur render, that their lives should be spared.2 Edward, when at Kirkliston, had raised some of the young squires in his army to the rank of knighthood ; and these new knights were sent to gain their spurs, by taking the other two fortalices. On coming before them, however, they found that the Scots had aban doned them to the enemy ; and having destroyed them, they rejoined the main army.3 These transactions occupied a month ; and the army began again to suffer severely from the scarcity of provisions. The fleet from Berwick was anxiously looked for; and Edward foresaw, that in the event of its arrival being protracted a few days longer, he should 1 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 160 3 Ibid. p. 161. Walsingham, p. 75. 3 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 161."], [161, "129S. PERIOD OF WALLACE. 155 be compelled to retreat. At last a few ships were seen off the coast, which brought a small supply; but the great body of the fleet was still detained by contrary winds, and a dangerous mutiny broke out in the camp. The Welsh troops had suffered much from famine ; and a present of wine having been sent to them by the king, their soldiers, in a paroxysm of intoxication and national antipathy, attacked the English quarters in the night, and inhumanly murdered eighteen priests. Upon this the English cavalry hastily ran to then weapons, and breaking in upon the Welsh, slew eighty men. In the morning the Welsh, of whom there were forty thousand in the army, exasperated at the death of their companions, threatened to join the Scots. \" Let them do so,\" said Edward, with his usual cool courage ; \" let them go over to my enemies : I hope soon to see the day when I shall chastise them both.\" This day, however, was, to all appearance, distant. The distress for provisions now amounted to an absolute famine. No intelligence had been re ceived of the Scottish army. As the English advanced, the country had been wTasted by an invisible foe ; and Edward, wearied out, was at length compelled to issue orders for a retreat to Edinburgh, hoping to meet with his fleet at Leith, and thereafter to recommence operations against the enemy. At this critical juncture, when the military skill and wisdom of the dispositions made by Wallace be came apparent, and when the moment to harass aud destroy the invading army in its retreat had arrived, the treachery of her nobles again betrayed Scotland. Two Scottish lords, Patrick earl of Dunbar, and the Earl of Angus, privately, at day-break, sought the quarters of the Bishop of Durham, and informed him that the Scots were encamped not far off in the forest"], [162, "1298. 156 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. of Falkirk. The Scottish earls, who dreaded the resentment of Edward, on account of their late renun- ciation of allegiance,1 did not venture to seek the king in person. They sent their intelligence by a page; and added, that having heard of his projected retreat, it was the intention of Wallace to surprise him by a night attack, and to hang upon and harass his rear. Edward, on hearing this welcome news, could not conceal his joy. \" Thanks be to God,\" he exclaimed, \"who hitherto hath extricated me from every danger! They shall not need to follow me, since I shall forth- with go and meet them.\" Without a moment's delay, orders were issued for the soldiers to arm, and hold themselves ready to march. The king was the first to put on his armour ; and, mounting his horse, rode through the camp, hastening the preparations, and giving orders in person to the merchants and sutlers, who attended the army, to pack up their wares and be ready to follow him. At length all was prepared; and at three o'clock the whole army was on its advance from Kirkliston to Falkirk, astonished at the sudden change in the plan of operations, and at the slow and deliberate pace with which they were led on. It was late before they reached a heath near Linlithgow, on which they encamped for the night. They were not allowed the refreshment of disarming themselves ; but, to use the striking words of Hemingford, \" each soldier slept on the ground, using his shield for his 1 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 162. Lord Hailes has omitted to notice the fact, that the intelligence regarding the position of the army was brought by two Scottish earls. It is difficult to understand how he should have overlooked it, as he quotes the very page of Hemingford where it is stated. He has attempted to disprove what appears to me completely established by the authority of Hemingford, \" that the defeat at Falkirk was brought about by the dissensions amongst the Scottish leaders.\""], [163, "1298. PERIOD OF WALLACE. 157 pillow ; each horseman had his horse beside him, and the horses themselves tasted nothing but cold iron, champing their bridles.\" In the middle of the night a cry was heard. King Edward, who slept on the heath, whilst a page held his horse, was awakened by a sud den stroke on his side. The boy had been careless ; and the horse, in changing his position, had put his foot on the king as he slept. Those around him cried out that their prince was wounded ; and this, in the confusion of the night, was soon raised into a shout that the enemy were upon them, so that they hastily armed themselves, and prepared for their defence. But the mistake wTas soon explained. Edward had been only slightly hurt ; and as the morning was near, he mounted his horse, and gave orders to march. They passed through Linlithgow a little before sun rise ; and on looking up to a rising ground, at some distance in their front, observed the ridge of the hill lined with lances. Not a moment was lost. Their columns marched up the hill, but on reaching it, the enemy had disappeared ; and as it was the feast of St Mary Magdalene, the king ordered a tent to be raised, where he and the Bishop of Durham heard mass. These lances had been the advanced guard of the enemy ; for while mass was saying, and the day be came brighter, the English soldier could distinctly see the Scots in the distance, arranging their lines and preparing for battle. The Scottish army did not amount to the third part of the force of the English ; and Wallace, who dreaded this great disparity, and knew how much Edward was likely to suffer by the protraction of the war and the want of provisions, at first thought of a retreat, and hastened to lead off his soldiers; but he soon found that the English were too near to admit of this"], [164, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1298. 158 being accomplished without certain destruction ; and he therefore proceeded to draw up his army, so as best to avail himself of the nature of the ground, and to sustain the attack of the English. He divided his infantry into four compact divisions, called Schiltrons,1 composed of his lancers. In the first line the men knelt, with their lances turned obliquely outwards, so as to present a serried front to the enemy on every side. In this infantry consisted the chief strength of the Scottish army, for the soldiers stood so close, and were so linked or chained together, that to break the line was extremely difficult.2 In the spaces between these divisions were placed the archers ; and in the rear was drawn up the Scottish cavalry, consisting of about a thousand heavy-armed horse.3 After hearing mass, the King of England, being in formed of the Scottish disposition of battle, hesitated to lead his army forward to the attack, and proposed that they should pitch their tents, and allow the sol diers and the horses time for rest and refreshment. This was opposed by his officers as unsafe, on account of their being nothing but a small rivulet between the two armies. \" What, then, would you advise? \" asked Edward. \" An immediate advance,\" said they ; \" the field and the victory will be ours.\" \u2014 \" In God's name, then, let it be so,\" replied the king; and without delay, the barons who commanded the first division, the Marshal of England, and the Earls of Hereford 1 See Notes and Illustrations, letter I. 2 \" Ther formost courey ther bakkis togidere sette, There speres poynt over poynt, so sare, and so tliikke And fast togidere joynt, to se it was werlike, Als a castelle thei stode, that were walled with stone, Thei wende no man of blode thorgh tham suld has gone.\" Langtoft's Chronicle, book ii. 1. 304, 305. Hemingford, vol. i. p. 163."], [165, "1298. PERIOD OF WALLACE. 159 and Lincoln, led their soldiers in a direct line against the enemy. They were not aware, however, of an extensive moss which stretched along the front of the Scottish position, and on reaching it, were obliged to make a circuit to the west to get rid of the obstacle. This retarded their attack ; meanwhile the second line, under the command of the Bishop of Durham, being better informed of the nature of the ground, in advancing inclined to the east with the same object. The bishop's cavalry wTere fiery and impetuous. Thirty six banners floated above the mass of spears, and showed how many leaders of distinction were in the field ; but Anthony Beck, who had seen enough of war to know the danger of too precipitate an attack, commanded them to hold back, till the third line, under the king, came up to support them. \" Stick to thy mass, bishop,\" cried Ralph Basset of Drayton, \" and teach not us what we ought to do in the face of an enemy.\" \u2014 \" On, then,\" replied the bishop ; \" set on in your own way. We are all soldiers to-day, and bound to do our duty.\" So saying, they hastened forward, and in a few minutes engaged with the first column of the Scots ; whilst the first line, which had extricated itself from the morass, commenced its at tack upon the other flank. Wallace's anxiety to avoid a battle had, in all probability, arisen from his having little dependence on the fidelity of the heavy armed cavalry, commanded by those nobles who hated and feared him ; and the event showed how just were his suspicions : for the moment the lines met, the whole body of the Scottish horse shamelessly retired without striking a blow.1 1 Fordun a Hearne, p. 981. \" Nam propter conceptam maliciam, ex fonte invidi\u00e6 generatam, quam erga dictum Willelmum Cumin enses habebant, cum suis complicibus campum deserentes, ill\u00e6si"], [166, "160 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1298. The columns of infantry, however, with the interme diate companies of archers, kept their ground, and a few of the armed knights remained beside them. Amongst these, Sir John Stewart of Bonkill, in marshalling the ranks of the archers from the forest of Selkirk, was thrown from his horse. The faithful bowmen tried to rescue him ; but in vain. He was slain ; and the tall and athletic figures of those who fell round him, drew forth the praise of the enemy.1 On the death of this leader, the archers gave way ; but the columns of the Scottish infantry stood firm ; and their oblique lances, pointing every way, presented a thick wood, through which no attacks of the cavalry could penetrate. Edward now brought up his reserve of archers and slingers, who showered their arrows upon them, with volleys of large round stones, which covered the ground where they stood. This continued and galling attack, along with the reiterated charges of the cavalry, at last broke the first line ; and the heavy-armed horse, pour ing in at the gap which was thus made, threw all into confusion, and carried indiscriminate slaughter through their ranks. Macduff, along with his vassals from Fife, was slain ; 2 and Wallace, with the remains of his army, having gained the neighbouring wood, made good his retreat, leaving nearly fifteen thousand men dead upon the field.3 On the English side, only two men of note fell ; one of them was Sir Bryan de Jaye, master of the Scottish templars, who, when pressing evaserunt.\" See, also, Hemingford, p. 164 \u2014 \" Fugerunt Scottorum equestres absque ullo gladii ictu ; \" and Winton, vol. ii. p. 101, book viii. chap. 15, 1. 47 ; also Chron. de Lanercost, p. 191. 1 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 165. 2 Winton, vol. ii. p. 101, book viii. chap. 15, 1. 45. 3 Tyrrel, vol. iii. p. 130, who quotes, as his authority, the Norwich Chronicle and the Chronicle of John Eversden ; both English autho rities.

The other was a companion of the same order, and of high rank.1 The remains of the Scottish army immediately re treated from Falkirk to Stirling. Unable to maintain the town against the English army, they set it on fire ; and Edward, on entering it on the fourth day after the battle, found it reduced to ashes.2 The convent of the Dominicans, however, escaped the flames; and here the king, who still suffered from the wound given him by his horse, remained for fifteen days, to recover his health. Meantime he sent a division of his army across the Forth into Clackmannanshire and Men teith, which, after ravaging the country, and plunder ing the villages, advanced in its destructive march through Fife. The whole of this rich and populous district was now regarded with great severity, on account of the resistance made by Macduff and the men of Fife at Falkirk. It was accordingly delivered up to complete military execution ; and, to use the words of an ancient chronicle, \"clene brent.\"3 The city of St Andrews was found deserted by its inhabi tants, and delivered to the flames. Beginning to bo in distress for provisions, the English pushed on to Perth, which they found already burnt by the Scots themselves ; so that, defeated in the hope of procuring supplies, and unable longer to support themselves in a country so utterly laid waste, they returned to Stir ling the castle of which Edward had commanded to be repaired. Having left a garrison there, he pro- 1 Notes and Illustrations, Letter K. 2 Prynne, Edward I., p. 791. Edward was at Stirling, 26th July. 3 Hardynge's Chronicle, 8vo, London, 1543, p. 165.

L"], [168, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1298. 162 ceeded to Abercorn,1 near Queensferry, where he had hopes to find his long-expected fleet, with supplies from Berwick ; but his ships were still detained. He then marched to Glasgow, and through the district of Clydesdale, by Bothwell, to Lanark, from which he proceeded towards the strong castle of Ayr, then in the hands of the younger Bruce earl of Carrick. Bruce fled at the approach of the king, after having set fire to the castle ; and Edward marched into Gal loway, with the intention of punishing this refractory baron, by laying waste his country.2 The army, how ever, began again to be grievously in want of provisions; and the king, after having for fifteen days struggled against famine, was constrained to return through the middle of Annandale, and to be contented with the cap ture of Brace's castle of Lochmaben,3 from which he proceeded to Carlisle. Thus were the fruits of the bloody and decisive battle of Falkirk plucked from the hands of Edward, by famine and distress, at the moment he expected to secure them ; and after leading against Scotland the most numerous and best appointed army which had perhaps ever invaded it, and defeating his enemies with great slaughter, he was compelled to retreat while still nearly the whole of the country beyond the Forth was unsubdued, and even when that part which he had wasted and overrun, was only wait ing for his absence, to rise into a new revolt against him.4 At Carlisle, the Earls of Norfolk and Hereford 1 Trivet, p. 313, calls this place \"Abourtoun juxta Queenesferrie ; \" and Hearne, the editor, in a note, observes it may mean Aberdour.

Yet the Scots were any thing but precipitate. They wasted the country, and"], [169, "PERIOD OF WALLACE. 1298. 163 left the army to return home, under the pretence that their men and horses were worn out with the expedi tion, but in reality because they were incensed at the king for a breach of faith. Edward, when at Loch maben, had, without consulting them or their brother nobles, disposed of the island of Arran to Thomas Bisset, a Scottish adventurer, who, having invaded and seized it, about the time of the battle of Falkirk, pretended that he had undertaken the enterprise for the King of England. This was done in violation of a solemn promise, that, without advice of his council, he would adopt no new measures ; and to atone for so irregular a proceeding, a parliament was held at Car lisle, in wrhich the king, who as yet w7as master of but a very small part of Scotland, assigned to his earls and barons the estates of the Scottish nobles. These, however, as an old historian remarks, were grants given in hope, not in possession ; and even the frail tenure of hope by which they were held, was soon threatened : for on reaching Durham, messengers arrived with the intelligence that the Scots were again in arms, and the king hastily returned to Tynemouth, and from thence to Coldingham near Beverley. His army was now much reduced by the desertion of Nor folk and Hereford ; and the soldiers who remained were weakened with famine and the fatigues of war. To commence another campaign at this late season was impossible ; but he instantly issued his writs for the assembling of a new army, to chastise, as he said, the obstinate and reiterated rebellions of the Scots ; and purposely retired from Edward ; nor did they fight, till the Earl of Dunbar and the Earl of Angus, treacherously brought information where the Scottish army lay, and enabled Edward, by a rapid night march, to surprise them.

Patrick earl of Dunbar and March, and his son Gilbert de Umfraville earl of Angus, Alexander de Baliol, and Simon Fraser, all of them Scottish barons, were at this time friends to Edward, and resident at his court, and to them were the same commands directed.2 Wallace, soon after the defeat of Falkirk, voluntarily resigned the office of Governor of Scotland. The Comyns had threatened to impeach him of treason for his conduct during the war ; and the Bruces, next in power to the Comyns, appear to have forgot their per sonal animosity, and united with their rivals to put him down. To these accusations, the disaster at Fal kirk gave some colour ; and he chose rather to return to the station of a private knight, than to retain an elevation which, owing to the jealousy of the nobility, brought ruin and distress upon the people.3 One 1 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 166. \" Juxta octavas beat\u00e6 virginis,\" 8th Sept.

An examination of the valuable historical materials which exist in the public libraries of France, might perhaps throw some light on this dark portion of his story. It is certain that his great name does not again recur in any authentic record, as bearing even a secondary command in the wars against Edward ; nor, indeed, do we meet with him in any public transaction, until eight years after this, when he fell a victim to the unrelenting vengeance of that prince. On the demission of Wallace, the Scottish barons chose John Comyn of Badenoch, the younger, and John de Soulis, to be governors of Scotland ;2 and, after some time, Bruce earl of Carrick, and William Lam berton bishop of St Andrews, were associated in the command.3 It is now necessary to allude to an attempt at a pacification between Edward and the Scots, which some time previous to this had been made by Philip of France ; as the negotiations which then took place conduct us to the termination of Baliol's career, and throw a strong light on the character of the King of England.

On the conclusion of a truce between the Kings of France and England in 1297,1 the articles of which afterwards formed the basis of the negotiations at Montreuil,2 and of the important peace of Paris,3 Philip demanded the liberation of Baliol, as his ally, from the Tower. He required, also, that the prelates, barons, knights, and other nobles, along with the towns and communities, and all the inhabitants of Scotland, of what rank and condition soever, should be included in the truce, and that not only Baliol, but all the other Scottish prisoners, should be liberated, on the delivery of hostages. These de mands were made by special messengers, sent for this purpose by Philip to the King of England;4 and it is probable that John Comyn the younger, the Earl of Athole, and other Scottish barons, who had left Edward on his embarkation at Hardenburgh in Flanders,8 and repaired to the court of France, prevailed upon Philip to be thus urgent in his endeavours to include them and their country in the articles of pacification. Ed ward, however, had not the slightest intention of allow ing the trace to be extended to the Scots. He was highly exasperated against them, and was then busy in collecting and organizing an army for the purpose of reducing their country.

Before embarking, his trunks were searched, and a crown of gold, the great seal of Scotland, many vessels of gold and silver, with a considerable sum of money, were found in them. The crown was seized by Edward, and hung up in the shrine of St Thomas the Martyr ; the great seal was also retained, but the money was permitted to remain in his coffers. On meeting the legate at Whitsand, Burghersh formally delivered to this prelate the person of the ex-king, to be at the sole disposal of his holiness ; but a material condition was added in the proviso, \" That the pope should not ordain or direct any thing in the kingdom of Scotland concerning the people or inhabitants, or any thing appertaining to the same kingdom, in behalf of John Baliol or his heirs.\" Edward's obsequiousness to the Roman see even went farther, for he conferred on the pope the power of disposing of Baliol's English estates. These estates were many and extensive. They were situated in nine different counties, and gave a com manding feudal influence to their possessor. But the king had not the slightest intention of paying any thing more than an empty compliment to Boniface ; for he retained the whole of Baliol's lands and manors in his own hand, and, some years afterwards, bestowed them upon his nephew, John of Bretagne.2 1 Walsingham, pp. 76, 77.

He was embroiled in serious disputes with his barons ; some of the most valuable prerogatives of his crown were being wrested from his hands ; he was deeply engaged with his negotiations with France ; he was on the eve of his marriage ; but nothing could divert him from the meditated war. He held a council of his nobility at Westminster, con cerning the Scottish expedition.

So intent was he on assembling the bravest knights and most hardy soldiers to accompany him, that he forbade, by public proclamation, all tournaments and plays of arms, so long as war lasted between him and his enemies ; and interdicted every knight, esquire, or soldier, from attending such exhibitions, or going in search of adventures, without his special permission.3 The object of the king was to march immediately into Scotland, to raise the siege of Stirling, then invested by the regents, and to reduce that great division of Scotland beyond the Firth of Forth, which, along with the powerful district of Galloway, still remained in dependent.

The great charter, and the perambulation of the forests, had not been duly observed, according to promise ; and without waiting remonstrance, they withdrew to their estates. Ed ward, in extreme anger, marched forward, with a small force, and seemed determined to risk a battle ; but being informed of the strong position of the Scottish army, and of the resolute spirit with which they awaited his advance, the king submitted to the neces sity of the case, and retreated to England.2 Mean while the English, who were beleaguered in Stirling, after making a brave and obstinate defence, had begun to suffer the extremities of famine ; upon which the king, finding it impossible to raise the siege, com manded them to capitulate ; 3 and the castle was deli vered to Sir John de Soulis, one of the regents. The Scots garrisoned it, and committed it to the keeping of Sir William Olifant. In the course of the following year, Edward, inde fatigable in the prosecution of his great object, again invaded Scotland, and found that the enemy, profiting by experience, had adopted that protracted warfare, which was their best security \u2014 avoiding a battle, and cutting off his supplies.4 Encamping in Annandale, he besieged and took Lochmaben, and afterwards sat 1 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 170.

After some resistance, this castle was likewise taken and garri soned,1 and the king marched into Galloway, where he had an interview with the bishop of that diocese, who, having in vain attempted to mediate a peace, the Earl of Buchan and John Comyn of Badenoch repaired personally to Edward, and had a violent interview with the king. They demanded that Baliol, their lawful king, should be permitted peaceably to reign over them ; and that their estates, which had been unjustly bestowed upon his English nobles, should be restored to their lords. Edward treated these propo sitions, which he considered as coming from rebels, with an unceremonious refusal ; and after declaring that they would defend themselves to the uttermost, the king and the Scottish barons parted in wrath. After this the king marched to Irvine, a seaport town situated on a river of the same name, and re mained there encamped for eight days, until provisions were brought up from the ships which lay on the coast. During this time the Scottish army showed itself on the opposite side of the river ; but on being successively attacked by the Earl of Surrey, the Prince of Wales, and the king himself, they rapidly retreated to their morasses and mountains. Through this rough and difficult ground, the heavy-armed English soldiers could not penetrate ; and the Welsh, whose familiarity with rocky passes rendered them well fitted for a warfare of this kind, obstinately refused to act. Thus baffled in his attempts at pursuit, Edward stationed 1 See a curious and interesting historical poem, in vol. iv. of Anti quarian Repertory, p. 469, published from a MS. in the British Mu seum : since published with valuable historical and heraldic additions, by Sir Harris Nicolas.

Affecting, therefore, now when it suited his convenience, to be moved by the representations of the plenipotentiaries sent from the King of France, he granted a trace to the Scots, and artfully gave to a measure of necessity the appearance of an act of mercy. Edward, however, cautiously added, that he acceded to the washes of Philip, out of favour to him as his friend and relative, not as the ally of Scotland ; nor would he give his consent to the cessation of arms, until the ambassadors of France aoTeed to consider it in this light : so careful was he lest any too hasty concession should interrupt his meditated vengeance, when a less refractory army and a milder season should allow him to proceed against his enemies.2 The king was induced, by another important event, to grant this truce to the Scots. This was no less than an extraordinary interposition upon the part of the pope, commanding him, as he reverenced his sacred authority, to desist from all hostilities ; and asserting that the kingdom of Scotland now belonged to the holy see, and from the most remote antiquity had done so.

This prelate, with much personal risk, owing to the unlicensed state of the country, and the danger of being seized by the bands of Scottish robbers, who roamed about, thirsting, as he tells us, for the blood of the English, travelled with his suite of clerks and learned dignitaries as far as Kirkcudbright ; and having passed the dangerous sands of the Solway with his chariots and horses, found the king encamped near the castle of Caerlave rock, and delivered to him the papal bull.3 Its argu ments, as far as concerned the right of the King of England to the feudal superiority of Scotland, were sufficiently sound and judicious ; but, as was to be expected, the grounds on which he could rest his own claim far less satisfactory. \" Your royal highness,\" he observed, \" may have heard, and we doubt not but the truth is locked in the book of your memory, that of old the kingdom of Scotland did and doth still be long in full right to the Church of Rome; and that neither your ancestors, kings of England, nor yourself, 1 Fordun a Hearne, p. 983.

When you yourself requested the presence of the same King Alexander at the solemnity of your coronation, you, in like manner, by your letters-patent, entreated it as a matter of favour and not of right. Moreover, when the King of Scotland did homage to you for his lands in Tynedale and Pen rith, he publicly protested that his homage was paid, not for his kingdom of Scotland, but for his lands in England : that as King of Scotland he was indepen dent, and owed no fealty ; which homage, so restricted, you did accordingly receive.

He disbanded his army ; he summoned a parliament to meet at Lincoln ; he wrote to the chancellors of both universities, commanding them to send to this parliament some of their most learned and expert civilians, to declare their opinion as to the right of the 1 Prynne, Edward I., p. 883.

It was notorious, they observed, in these parts of the world, that from the very first original of the kingdom of England, the kings thereof, as well in the times of the Britons as of the Saxons, enjoyed the superiority and direct dominion of the kingdom of Scotland, and continued either in actual or in virtual possession of 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, new edit. vol. i. p. 923. 5 Tyrrel, vol. iii. p. 146."], [185, "INTERREGNUM. 1301. 179 the same through successive ages.

That with regard to their rights, or other temporalities in that kingdom, the kings of England have never answered, nor ought they to answer, before any ecclesiastical or secular judge, and this on account of the freedom and pre-eminence of their royal dignity, and the custom to this effect observed through all ages.

Having brought these matters to a close at Linlithgow, the king proceeded to Roxburgh, and from this, by Morpeth and Durham, returned to London.1 The perseverance and courage of the Scots were ill supported by their allies. Boniface soon deserted them ; and, with extreme inconsistence, forgetting his former declarations, addressed a letter of admonition to Wishart, the Bishop of Glasgow, commanding him to desist from all opposition to Edward. Wishart had been delivered from an English prison some time before, and, on taking the oath of fealty, had been received into favour ; but unable to quench his love of liberty, or perhaps of intrigue, he had recommenced his opposition to the English ; and the pope now addressed him as the \" prime mover and instigator of all the tumult and dissension which has arisen between his dearest son in Christ, Edward king of England, and the Scots.\"2 At the same time, his holiness addressed a bull to the body of the Scottish bishops, commanding them to be at peace with Edward, and threatening them, in case of disobedience, with a severer remedy. 3 Deserted by Boniface, the Scots still looked to Philip for support ; and aware that the negotiations F\u0153dera, vol. i. new edit. p. 938, signed at Linlithgow, 26th January, 1302?

But Philip, having been defeated in Flanders, became anxious, at all risks, to conclude a peace with Eng land, and to concentrate his efforts for the reduction of the revolted Flemings.2 Edward, who had hitherto supported the Flemings, entertained the same wish to direct his undivided strength against the Scots, and a mutual sacrifice of allies was the consequence. The English king paved the way for this, by omitting the Earl of Flanders in the enumeration of his allies, in the former truce ratified at Linlithgow ; and Philip, in return, not only left out the Scots in the new truce concluded at Amiens, but entirely excluded them in the subsequent and final treaty of peace not long afterwards signed at Paris.3 Previous, however, to the conclusion of this treaty, so fatal to the Scots, the army of Edward experienced a signal defeat near Edinburgh. John de Segrave had been appointed Governor of Scotland; and Edward, much incensed at the continued resistance of the Scots, who, on the expiration of the truce, had recommenced the war with great vigour, directed letters to Ralph Fitz-William, and twenty six of his principal barons. By these he informed them, that he had received intelligence from Segrave of the success of his enemies, who, after ravaging the country, and burning and seizing his towns and castles, threatened, unless put down with a strong hand, to 1 Maitland, vol. i. p. 461.

Amongst these were Segrave's brothers,3 and Robert de Neville, a noble baron, who had been engaged with Edward in his Welsh wars.4 In approaching Roslin, Segrave had separated his army into0three divisions ; and not meeting with an enemy, each division encamped on its own ground, without having established any communi cation with the others. The first division was led by Segrave himself; the second probably by Ralph de Manton, called, from his office, Ralph the Cofferer; the third by Neville. Early in the morning of the 24th February, Segrave and his soldiers were slumber ing in their tents, in careless security, when a boy rushed in, and called out that the enemy were upon them.

INTERREGNUM. 185 of the English, had collected a force of eight thousand horse, and marching in the night from Biggar to Roslin, surprised the enemy in their encampment. Segrave's division was entirely routed ; he himself, after a severe wound, was made prisoner, along with sixteen knights and thirty esquires ; his brother and son were seized in bed, and the Scots had begun to collect the booty, and calculate on the ransom, when the second division of the English army appeared. A cruel but necessary order was given to slaythe prisoners; and this having been done, the Scots immediately attacked the enemy, who, after an obstinate defence, were put to flight with much slaughter. The capture of Ralph the Cofferer, a rich booty, and many prisoners, were the fruits of this second attack, which had scarcely concluded, when the third division, led by Sir Robert Neville, was seen in the distance. Worn out by their night-march, aud fatigued by two successive attacks, the little army of the Scots thought of an immediate retreat. But this, probably, the proximity of Neville's division rendered impossible ; and after again resorting to the same horrid policy of putting to death their prisoners, an obstinate conflict began, which terminated in the death of Neville, and the total defeat of his division.1 There occurred in this battle a striking but cruel trait of national animosity. Ralph the Cofferer had been taken prisoner by Sir Simon Fraser ; and this paymaster of Edward, though a priest, like many of the ecclesiastics and bishops of those fierce times, preferred the coat of mail to the surplice. On the order being given to slay the prisoners, Sir Ralph begged his life might be spared, and promised a large ransom. \" This laced hauberk is no priestly habit,\" 1 See Notes and Illustrations, letter N."], [192, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1302. 186 observed Fraser ; \" where is thine albe, or thy hood ? Often have you robbed us of our lawful wages, and done us grievous harm. It is now our turn to sum up the account, and exact its payment.\" Saying this, he first struck off the hands of the unhappy priest, and then severed his head with one blow from his body.1 The remains of the English army fled to Edward, in England ; and the Scots, after resting from their fatigues, collected and divided their booty, and returned home.2 This persevering bravery of the Scots in defence of their country, was unfortunately united to a credulity which made them the dupes of the policy of Philip. Although not included in the treaty of Amiens, the French monarch had the address to persuade the Scottish deputies then at Paris, that having concluded his own affairs with Edward, he would devote his whole efforts to mediate a peace between them and England; and he entreated them, in the meantime, to remain with him at the French court, until they could carry back to Scotland intelligence of his having completed the negotiation with Edward on behalf of themselves and their countrymen. The object of Philip, in all this, was to prevent the return of the deputies, amongst whom were some of the most warlike and influential of the Scottish nobles, previous to the expedition which Edward was about to lead against theircountry. Unsus picious of any false dealing, they consented to remain ; and in the meantime addressed a letter to the governor and nobility of Scotland, in which they exhorted them to be of good courage, and to persevere in vindicating the liberties of their country. \" You would greatly rejoice,\" they say in this letter, \" if you were aware 1 Langtoft, vol. ii. p. 319. 5 Winton, vol. ii. p. 117."], [193, "1303.

And if the King of England consent to a truce, as we firmly expect he will, do you likewise agree to the same, according to the form which the ambassadors of the King of France shall propose by one of our number, who will be sent to you. But if the King of England, like Pharaoh, shall grow hardened, and continue the war, we beseech you, by the mercy of Christ, that you quit yourselves like men ; so that by the assistance of God, and your own courage, you may gain the victory.\"1 To gain the victory, however, over the determined perseverance and overwhelming military strength of the English king, was no easy task. The distress of Scotland, from its exposure to the continued ravages of war, had reached a pitch which the people of the land could endure no longer. They became heart broken for a time, under a load of misery and suffering, from which they could see no relief but in absolute submission ; the governor Comyn, the late guardian Wallace, and the few patriotic nobles who were still in the field, found it impossible to keep an army to gether ; and all men felt assured that the entire sub jugation of the country was an event which no human power could possibly prevent or delay. If Edward, at this crisis, again resumed the war, it was evident that nothing could oppose him. We may judge, then, of the desolating feelings of this unhappy country, when word was brought that the King of England had once more collected the whole armed force of his dominions, and leading his army in person, had passed the border. 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. i. new edit. p. 955, June 8, 1303."], [194, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1303. 188 The recent defeat at Roslin had chafed and inflamed his passions to the utmost ; and he declared that it was his determined purpose either to reduce the nation to entire subjection, or to raze the land utterly with fire and sword, and turn it to a desert, fit only for the beasts of the field. In recording the history of this last miserable campaign, the historian has to tell a tale of sullen submission, and pitiless ravage ; he has little to do but to follow in dejection the chariot wheels of the conqueror, and to hear them crushing under their iron weight all that was free, and brave, in a devoted country. Edward separated his army into two divisions. He gave the command of one to his eldest son, the Prince of Wales, who directed his march westward into Scot land,1 whilst the king himself, at the head of the second division, proceeded eastward by Morpeth and Roxburgh, and reached the capital without challenge or interruption, in the beginning of June, 1303. The whole course of the king, as well as that of the prince, was marked by smoke and devastation, by the plunder of towns and villages, the robbery of granges and garners, the flames of woods, and the destruction of the small tracts of cultivated lands which yet remained. Wherever he turned his arms, the inhabitants sub mitted to a power which it was impossible for them to resist ; and the governor Comyn, Sir Simon Fraser, and the late guardian William Wallace, were driven into the wilds and fastnesses, where they still continued the war by irregular predatory expeditions against the convoys of the English. From Edinburgh, Edward continued his victorious progress by Linlithgow and Clackmannan to Perth, and afterwards by Dundee and Brechin proceeded to 1 Hemingford, 205. Langtoft, 321 ."], [195, "1303. INTERREGNUM. 189 Aberdeen. From this city, pursuing his march north ward, he reached Banff, and from thence he pushed on to Kiuloss in Moray : leaving this, he struck into the heart of Moray, and for some time established his quarters at Lochendorb, a castle strongly situated upon an island in a lake.1 Here he received the oaths and homage of the northern parts of the kingdom,2 and, it is probable, added to the fortifications of the castle. It is curious to find that, after a lapse of near five hundred years, the memory of this great king is still preserved in the tradition of the neighbourhood ; and that the peasant, when he points out to the traveller the still massy and noble remains of Lochendorb, men tions the name of Edward I. as connected in some mysterious way with their history. From this remote strength, the king, penetrating into Aberdeenshire, reached the strong castle of Kil drummie in Garvyach,3 from whence he retraced his route back to Dundee. Thence, probably by Perth, he marched to Stirling and Cambuskenneth, visited Kinross, and finally proceeded to take up his winter quarters at Dunfermline early in the month of Decem ber, where he was joined by his queen.4 In this progress, the castle of Brechin shut its gates against him. It was commanded by Sir Thomas Maule, a Scottish knight of great intrepidity; and such was the impregnable nature of the walls, that the battering engines of the king could not, for many days, make the least impression. So confident was Maule of this, that he stood on the ramparts, and, in derision of the English soldiers below, wiped off with a towel the dust 1 Notes and Illustrations, letter 0.

When he lay dying on the ground, some of his soldiers asked him if now they might surrender the castle. Though life was ebbing, the spirit of the soldier indignantly revived at this proposal, and pronouncing maledictions on their cow ardice, he expired.2 The castle immediately opened its gates to the English, after having stood a siege of twenty days. The English king was chiefly employed at Dun fermline in receiving the submission of those Scottish barons and great men who had not made their peace during his late progress through the kingdom. But he engaged in other occupations little calculated to conciliate the Scots ; for when at this place, his sol diers, by orders of their master, with savage barbarity destroyed a Benedictine monastery, of such noble dimensions, that, an English historian informs us, three kings, with their united retinues, might have lodged within its walls. On account of its ample size, the Scottish nobles had often held their parliaments within its great hall \u2014 a sufficient crime, it would appear, in the eyes of the king. The church of the monastery, with a few cells for the monks, were spared ; the rest was razed to the ground. Meanwhile Comyn the governor, along with Sir Simon Fraser, and a few barons, still kept up a show of resistance ; and Wallace, who, since his abdication of the supreme power, had continued his determined 1 \" Stetit ille Thomas cum manutergio et extrusit C\u00e6suram de Muro in subsannationem et derisum totius exercitus Anglicani.\" Math.

The castle of Stirling, also, still held out ; and as it was certain that the king would besiege it, Comyn, with the faint hope of defend ing the passage of the Forth, collected as many soldiers as he could muster, and encamped on the ground where Wallace had gained his victory over Cressingham and Surrey. But the days of victory were past. The king, the moment he heard of this, forded the river in person, at the head of his cavalry, and routed and dis persed the last remnant of an army on which the hopes of Scotland depended. He had intended to pass the river by the bridge, but on coming forward he found it had been broken down and burnt by the Scots. Had the leaders profited by the lesson taught them by Wallace, they would have kept up the bridge, and attacked the English when defiling over it ; but their rashness in destroying it compelled the king to find a ford, and enabled him to cross in safety.1 Soon after this expiring effort, the governor, with all his adherents, submitted to Edward. The Earls of Pembroke and Ulster, with Sir Henry Percy, met Comyn at Strathorde in Fife,2 on the 9th of February ; and a negotiation took place, in which the late regent and his followers, after stipulating for the preservation of their lives, liberties, and lands, delivered themselves up, and agreed to the infliction of any pecuniary fine which the conqueror should think right. The castles and strengths of Scotland were to remain in the hands of Edward, and the government of the country to be modelled and administered at his pleasure. From this negotiation those were specially excepted, for whom, 1 Notes and Illustrations, letter Q,.

In this honourable roll we find Wishart bishop of Glasgow, James the Steward of Scotland, Sir John Soulis the late associate of Comyn in the government of the king dom, David de Graham, Alexander de Lindesay, Simon Fraser, Thomas Bois, and William Wallace.1 To all these persons, except Wallace, certain terms, more or less rigorous, were held out, on accepting which, Ed ward guaranteed to them their lives and their liberty; and we know that sooner or later they accepted the conditions. But of this great man a rigorous exclu sion was made. \" As for William Wallace,\" I quote the words of the deed, \" it is covenanted, that if he thinks proper to surrender himself, it must be uncon ditionally to the will and mercy of our lord the king.\" Such a surrender, it is well known, gave Edward the unquestionable right of ordering his victim to imme diate execution. An English parliament was soon after appointed to meet at St Andrews, to which the king summoned the Scottish barons who had again come under his alle giance. This summons was obeyed by all except Sir Simon Fraser and Wallace ; and these two brave men, along with the garrison of Stirling, which still defied the efforts of the English, were declared outlaws by the vote, not only of the English barons, but with the extorted consent of their broken and dispirited coun trymen.2 At length Fraser, despairing of being able again to rouse the spirit of the nation, consented to accept the hard conditions of fine and banishment offered him by the conqueror ; and Wallace found himself standing 1 Prynne, Hist.

These terms, however, partook more of the bold character of the mind which had never bowed to Edward, than of the spirit of a suppliant suing for pardon. When reported to Edward he broke out into ungovernable rage, cursed him by the fiend as a traitor, pronounced his malediction on all who sus tained or supported him, and set a reward of three hundred marks upon his head. On hearing this, Wal lace betook himself again to the wilds and mountains, and subsisted on plunder.2 The castle of Stirling was now the only fortress which had not opened its gates to Edward. It had been intrusted by its governor, John de Soulis, who was still in France, to the care of Sir William Olifant, an experienced soldier, who, on seeing the great pre parations made by Edward against his comparatively 1 See Notes and Illustrations, letter R. s It is singular that this last circumstance should have escaped Lord Hailes and our other historians.

Thirteen warlike engines were brought by the besiegers to bear upon the fortress.2 The missiles which they threw consisted of leaden balls of great size, with huge stones and javelins, and the leaden roof of the refec tory of St Andrews was torn away to supply materials for these deadly machines ;3 but for a long time the efforts of the assailants produced no breach in the walls, whilst the sallies of the besieged, and the dexterity with which their engines were directed and served, made great havoc in the English army. During all this, Edward, although his advanced age might have 1 Prynne, Edward I., p. 1051. 2 \" Threttene great engynes, of all the reame the best, Brouht thei to Strivelyne, the kastelle down to kest.\" Langtoft, p. 326.

Mounted on horse back, he rode beneath the walls to make his observa tions, and was more than once struck by the stones aud javelins thrown from the engines on the ramparts. One day, when riding so near that he could distinguish the soldiers who worked the balist\u00e6, a javelin struck him on the breast, and lodged itself in the steel plates of his armour. The king with his own hand plucked out the dart, which had not pierced the skin, and shaking it in the air, called out aloud, that he would hang the villain who had hit him.1 On another occa sion, when riding within the range of the engines, a stone of great size and weight struck so near, and with such noise and force, that the king's horse backed and fell with his master ; upon which some of the soldiers, seeing his danger, ran in and forced Edward down the hill towards the tents.2 Whilst these engines within the castle did so much execution, those of Edward, being of small dimensions in comparison with the height of the walls, had little effect ; and when fagots and branches were thrown into the fosse, to facilitate the assault, a sally from the castle succeeded in setting the whole in flames, and carried confusion and slaughter into the English lines. The siege had now continued from the 22d of April to the 20th of May, without much impression having been made. But determination was a marked feature in the powerful character of the king. He wrote to the sheriffs of York, Lincoln, and London, commanding them to purchase and send instantly to him, at Stirling, all the balist\u00e6, quarrells, bows and arrows, which they could collect within their counties; 2 Math.

In addition to this, he commanded his engineers to construct two immense machines, which, unlike those employed at first, over topped the walls, and were capable of throwing stones and leaden balls of three hundred pounds weight. The first of these was a complicated machine, which, although much pains was bestowed on its construction, did no great execution ; but the second, which the soldiers called the wolf, was more simple in its form, and, from its size and strength, most murderous in its effects.4 These great efforts succeeded : a large breach was 1 Rymer, new edit. vol. i. p. 963. 2 Ibid. p. 964. 3 Wardrohe Book of Edward I., p. 52. 4 Ibid., p. 52.

The brave little garrison, which for three months had successfully resisted the whole strength of the English army, were now dreadfully reduced by the siege. Their provisions were exhausted. Thirteen women, the wives and sisters of the knights and barons who defended the place, were shut up along with the soldiers, and their distress and misery became extreme. In these circumstances \u2014 their walls cast down, the engines carrying the troops wheeled up to the breach, and the scaling ladders fixed on the parapet \u2014 a depu tation was sent to Edward, with an offer to capitulate, on security of life and limb. This proposal the king met with contempt and scorn ; but he agreed to treat on the terms of an unconditional surrender, and ap pointed four of his barons, the Earls of Gloucester and Ulster, with Sir Eustace le Poor, and Sir John de Mowbray, to receive the last resolution of the besieged. Sir John and Sir Eustace accordingly proceeded to the castle gate, and summoned the governor ; upon which Sir William Olifant, his kinsman Sir William de Dupplin, and their squire Thomas Lillay, met the English knights, and proceeded with them to an interview with the two earls. At this meeting they consented, for themselves and their companions, to surrender unconditionally to the King of England ; and they earnestly requested that he would permit them to make this surrender in his own presence, and himself witness their contrition.1 1 It is asserted, both by Fordun a Hearne, p. 991, and by Winton, vol. ii. p. 119, that the castle was delivered up to the English on a written agreement signed by Edward, that the garrison should be quit and free of all harm ; which agreement Edward perfidiously broke.

A melan choly pageant of feudal submission now succeeded. Sir William Olifant, and, along with him, twenty-five of the knights and gentlemen, his companions in the siege, presented themselves before the king, who re ceived them in princely state, surrounded by his nobles and warriors. In order to save their lives, these brave men were compelled to appear in a garb and posture, against which every generous feeling revolts. Their persons were stript to their shirts and drawers ; their heads and feet were bare ; they wore ropes around their necks ; and thus, with clasped hands and bended knee, they implored the clemency of the king. Upon this, Edward, of his royal mercy, exempted them from the ignominy of being chained ; but Olifant was sent to the Tower, and the rest were imprisoned in different castles throughout England.1 The garrison was found to consist of no more than a hundred and forty soldiers; an incredibly small number, if we consider that for three months they had resisted the efforts of the army of England, led by the king in person.2 Having thus secured his conquest, by the reduction of the last castle which had resisted his authority, and having appointed English captains to the other strengths in Scotland, Edward left the temporary government of that country to John de Segrave ; and, accompanied by the chief of the Scottish nobility, proceeded by Selkirk and Jedburgh to Yetholm, upon some countenance to this accusation, is the fact, that Olifant and Dupplin agreed to surrender according to the terms which had been offered hy the Earl of Lincoln ; and the record somewhat suspiciously conceals what these terms were.

He had already set a large sum upon his head ; he gave strict orders to his captains and governors in Scotland to be constantly on the alert ; and he now carefully sought out those Scotsmen who were enemies to Wallace, and bribed them to discover and betray him.2 For this purpose he commanded Sir John de Mowbray, a Scottish knight then at his court, and who seems at this time to have risen into great trust and favour with Edward, to carry with him into Scotland Ralph de Haliburton, one of the prisoners lately taken at Stirling. Haliburton was ordered to co-operate with the other Scotsmen who were then engaged in the attempt to seize Wallace, and Mowbray was to watch how this base person conducted himself.3 What were the particular measures adopted by Hali burton, or with whom he co-operated, it is now impos sible to determine ; but it is certain that, soon after this, Wallace was betrayed and taken by Sir John Menteith, a Scottish baron of high rank. Perhaps we are to trace this infamous transaction to a family feud. At the battle of Falkirk, Wallace, who, on account of his overbearing conduct, had never been popular with the Scottish nobility, opposed the pre tensions of Sir John Stewart of Bonkill, when this 1 Math.

In that dis astrous defeat, Sir John Stewart, with the flower of his followers, was surrounded and slain ; and it is said that Sir John Menteith, his uncle, never forgave Wal lace for making good his own retreat without attempt ing a rescue.1 By whatever motive he was actuated, Menteith succeeded in discovering his retreat, through the treacherous information of a servant who waited on him ; 2 and having invaded the house by night, seized him in bed, and instantly delivered him to Edward. His fate, as was to be expected, was soon decided ; but the circumstances of refined cruelty and torment which attended his execution, reflect an indelible stain upon the character of Edward ; and, were they not stated by the English historians themselves, could scarcely be believed. Having been carried to Lon don, he was brought with much pomp to Westminster Hall, and there arraigned of treason. A crown of laurel, in mockery placed, was on his head, because Wallace had been heard to boast that he deserved to wear a crown in that hall. Sir Peter Mallorie, the king's justice, then impeached him as a traitor to the King of England,3 as having burnt the villages and abbeys, stormed the castles, and slain and tortured the liege subjects of his master the king. Wallace indignantly and truly repelled the charge of treason, as he never had sworn fealty to Edward ; but to the other articles of accusation, he pleaded no defence : they were notorious, and he was condemned to death. The sentence was executed on the 23d of August. Discrowned and chained, he was now dragged at the 1 Fordun a Hearne, p. 981.

The head was placed on a pole on London Bridge, his right arm above the bridge at Newcastle, his left arm was sent to Berwick, his right foot and limb to Perth, and his left quarter to Aberdeen.3 \" These,\" says an old English historian, \" were the trophies of their favourite hero, which the Scots had now to contem plate, instead of his banners and gonfanons, which they had once proudly followed.\" But he might have added, that they were trophies more glorious than the richest banner that had ever been borne before him ; and if Wallace already had been, for his daring and romantic character, the idol of the people ; if they had long regarded him as the only man who- had asserted, throughout every change of circumstances, the independence of his country ; now, that the muti lated limbs of this martyr to liberty were brought amongst them, it may well be conceived how deep and inextinguishable were their feelings of pity and revenge. Tyranny is proverbially short-sighted ; and Edward, assuredly, could have adopted no more cer tain way of canonizing the memory of his enemy, and increasing the unforgiving animosity of his country men. The course of events which soon followed this cruel sentence, demonstrates the truth of these remarks. 1 Winton, vol. ii. Notes, p. 502.

For fifteen years had Edward been employed in the reduction of Scotland ; Wallace was put to death ; the rest of the nobility had sworn fealty ; the for tresses of the land were in the hands of English governors, who acted under an English guardian ; a parliament was held at London, where the Scottish nation was represented by ten commissioners; and these persons, in concert with twenty English com missioners, organized an entirely new system of govern ment for Scotland. The English king, indeed, affected to disclaim all violent or capricious innovations ; and it was pretended that the new regulations which were introduced, were dictated by the advice of the Scottish nobles, and with a respect to the ancient laws of the land ; but he took care that all that really marked an independent kingdom should be destroyed ; and that, whilst the name of authority was given to the Scottish commissioners who were to sit in parliament, the reality of power belonged solely to himself. Scotland, therefore, might be said to be entirely reduced ; and Edward flattered himself that he was now in quiet to enjoy that sovereignty which had been purchased by a war of fifteen years, and at an incredible expense of blood and treasure. But how idle are the dreams of ambition ! In less than six months from the execu tion of Wallace,1 this new system of government was entirely overthrown, and Scotland was once more free. 1 Wallace was executed 23d August, 1305.

CONTEMPORARY PRINCES. Kingt of England. King of France. Philip IV. Pope. Edward I. Edward II. Clement V. We now enter upon the history of this great and rapid revolution ; and in doing so, it will first be necessary to say a few words upon the early character and conduct of the Earl of Carrick, afterwards Robert the First. This eminent person was the grandson of that Robert Bruce, lord of Annandale, who was competi tor for the crown with John Baliol. He was lineally descended from Isabella, second daughter of David earl of Huntingdon, brother of William the Lion. John Baliol, the late King of Scotland, had, as we have already seen, renounced for ever all claim to the throne ; and his son Edward was at that time a minor and a captive. Marjory Baliol, the sister of this un fortunate monarch, married John Comyn lord of Badenoch. Their son, John Comyn, commonly called the Red Comyn, the opponent of Wallace, and, till the fatal year 1303, the regent of the kingdom, pos sessed, as the son of Marjory, Baliol's sister, a right to the throne, after the resignation of Baliol and his"], [210, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1305. 204 son, which, according to the principles on which Ed ward pronounced his decision, was unquestionable. He was also connected by marriage with the royal family of England,1 and was undoubtedly one of the most powerful, if not the most powerful, subject in Scotland. Bruce and Comyn were thus the heads of two rival parties in the state, whose animosity was excited by their mutual claims to the same crown, and whose interests were irreconcileable. Accordingly, when Edward gave his famous award in favour of Baliol, Bruce, the competitor, refused to take the oath of homage ; 2 and although he acquiesced in the deci sion, gave up his lands in the vale of Annandale, which he must have held as a vassal under Baliol, to his son, the Earl of Carrick : again, in 1293, the Earl of Carrick resigned his lands and earldom of Carrick to his son Robert, then a young man in the service of the King of England.3 In the years 1295 and 1296. Edward invaded Scotland, and reduced Baliol, and the party of the Comyns, to submission. During this contest, Bruce the Earl of Carrick, and son of the competitor, possessed of large estates in England, continued faithful to Edward. He thus preserved his estates, and hoped to see the destruction of the only rivals who stood between him and his claim to the throne. Nor was this a vain expectation; for Edward, on hearing of the revolt of Baliol and the Comyns, undoubtedly held out the prospect of the throne to Bruce:4 and these circumstances afford us a complete explanation of the inactivity of that baron and his son at this period. Meanwhile Baliol and the Comyns 1 His wife Johanna was daughter of William de Valence earl of Pembroke. This Earl of Pembroke was son of Hugh de Brienne, who married Isabella, widow of John king of England, grandfather of Edward the First. 2 Leland, Collect, vol. i. p. 540. 3 Ibid. 4 See supra, p. 108."], [211, "1305. ROBERT BRUCE. 205 issued a hasty order, confiscating the estates of all who preserved their allegiance to Edward. In con sequence of this resolution, the lordship of Annandale, the paternal inheritance of the Earl of Carrick, was declared forfeited, and given by Baliol to John Comyn earl of Buchan, who immediately seized and occupied Bruce's castle of Lochmaben, an insult which there is reason to think the proud baron never forgave. Com pelled to submit to Edward, the Comyns, aud the principal nobles who supported them, were now car ried prisoners into England ; and, when restored to liberty, it was only on condition that they should join his army in Flanders, and assist him in his foreign wars. During the brief but noble stand made by Wallace for the national liberty, Robert Bruce, then a young man of three-and-twenty, was placed in difficult and critical circumstances. It was in his favour that his rivals, the Comyns, were no longer in the field, but kept in durance by Edward. His father remained in England, where he possessed large estates, and con tinued faithful in his allegiance to the king. At this time it is important to remark what Walter Heming ford, a contemporary English historian, has said of young Bruce. After mentioning the revolt which was headed by Wallace, he informs us, \"that the Bishop of Carlisle, and other barons, to whom the peace of that district was committed, became suspicious of the fidelity of Robert Bruce the younger, Earl of Carrick, and sent for him to come and treat upon the affairs of Edward, if he intended to remain faithful to that monarch.\" Bruce, he continues, did not dare to dis obey, but came on the day appointed, with his vassals of Galloway, and took an oath on the sacred host, and upon the sword of St Thomas, that he would assist the"], [212, "206 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1305. king against the Scots, and all his enemies, both by word and deed. Having taken this oath, he returned to his country; and, to give a colour of truth to his fidelity, collected his vassals, and ravaged the lands of William Douglas, carrying the wife and infant chil dren of this knight into Annandale. Soon after this, however, as he returned from a meeting of the Scottish conspirators to his own country, having assembled his father's men of Annandale, (for his father himself then resided in the south of England, and was ignorant of his son's treachery,) he told them, \" that it was true he had lately taken a foolish oath at Carlisle, of which they had heard.\" He assured them that it was ex torted by force, and that he not only deeply repented what he had done, but hoped soon to get absolution. Meanwhile, he added, \"that he was resolved to go with his own vassals and join the nation from which he sprung; and he earnestly entreated them to do the same, and come along with him as his dear friends and counsellors. The men of Annandale, however, disliking the peril of this undertaking, whilst their master, the elder Bruce, was in England, decamped in the night ; and the young Bruce, aspiring to the crown, as was generally reported, joined himself to the rebels, and entered into the conspiracy with the Bishop of Glas gow and the Steward of Scotland, who were at the bottom of the plot.\" J Such is an almost literal trans lation from the words of Walter Hemingford, whose information as to Scottish affairs at this period, seems to have been minute and accurate. At this time the ambition or the patriotic feelino-s of Bruce were certainly short-lived; for, not many months after, he made his peace at the capitulation at 1 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 120. Hailes, 8vo edit, vol. i. p. 301."], [213, "1805. ROBERT BRUCE. 207 Irvine, and gave his infant daughter, Marjory, as a hostage for his fidelity.1 Subsequent to the successful battle of Stirling, the Comyns, no longer in the power of the English king, joined Wallace ; and young Bruce, once more seeing his rivals for the throne opposed to Edward, kept aloof from public affairs, anxious, no doubt, that they should destroy themselves by such opposition. He did not, as has been errone ously stated, accede to the Scottish party,2 but, on the contrary, shut himself up in the castle of Ayr, and re fused to join the army which fought at Falkirk. As little, however, did he cordially co-operate with the English king, although his father, the elder Bruce, and his brother, Bernard Bruce, were both in his service, aud, as there is strong reason to believe, in the English army which fought at Falkirk. Young Bruce's conduct, in short, at this juncture, was that of a cautious neutral; but Edward, who approved of no such lukewarmness in those who had sworn homage to him, immediately after the battle of Falkirk advanced into the west. Bruce, on his approach, fled; and Edward afterwards led his army into Annandale, aud seized his strong castle of Lochmaben.3 In a parliament held not long subsequent to this, the king gave to his nobles some of the estates of the chief men in Scotland ; but the great estates of the Bruce family, embracing Annandale and Carrick, were not alienated. The fidelity of the elder Bruce to Eng land, in all probability preserved them. On the 13th 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. i. new edit. p. 868. Robert Brace earl of Carrick, James the Steward of Scotland, John his brother, Alexander de Lindesay, and William de Douglas, submitted themselves to Ed ward. On 30th July, 1297, John Comyn son of John lord of Bade noch, John earl of Athole, and Richard Suvard, were liberated from prison, and accompanied Edward to Flanders. 2 Hailes' Annals, vol. i. 4to, p. 256-263. 3 Hemingford, p. 166."], [214, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1305. 208 of November, 1299, we find Robert Bruce the younger, Earl of Carrick, associated, as one of the regents of the kingdom, with John Comyn, that powerful rival with whom he had hitherto never acted in concert.1 It seems, however, to have been an unnatural coalition, arising more out of Brace's having lost the confidence of Edward, than indicative of any new cordiality be tween him and Comyn ; and there can be little doubt, also, that they were brought to act together, by a mutual desire to humble and destroy the power of Wallace, in which they succeeded. But to punish this union, Edward, in his short campaign of 1300, wasted Annandale, took Lochmaben castle, and march ed into Galloway, ravaging Bruce's country. Thus ex posed to, and suffering under, the vengeance of the King of England, it might be expected that he should have warmly joined with his brother regents in the war. But this seems not to have been the case. He did not take an active share in public affairs ; and previous to the battle of Roslin, he returned, as we have seen, to the English party. During the fatal and victorious progress of Edward through Scotland in 1303, he remained faithful to that monarch ; while his rivals, the Comyns, continued in arms against him. On the death of his father, which took place in 1304, Bruce was permitted by the King of England to take possession of his whole English and Scottish estates ; and so high does he appear to have risen in the esteem of Edward, that he acted a principal part in the set tlement of the kingdom in 1304; whilst his rival Comyn, was subjected to a heavy fine, and seems to have wholly lost the confidence of the king.2 In this situation matters stood at the important 1 Rymer, vol. ii. p. 859. 2 Trivet, p. 334."], [215, "1305. ROBERT BRUCE. 209 period when we concluded the last chapter. Bruce, whose conduct had been consistent only upon selfish principles, found himself, when compared with other Scottish barons, in an enviable situation. He had preserved his great estates, his rivals were overpowered, and, on any new emergency occurring, the way was partly cleared for his own claim to the crown. The effect of all this upon the mind of Comyn may be easily imagined. He felt that one, whose conduct, in consistency and honour, had been inferior to his own, was rewarded with the confidence and favour of the king ; whilst he who had struggled to the last for the liberty of his country, became an object of suspi cion and neglect. This seems to have rankled in his heart, and he endeavoured to instil suspicions of the fidelity of Bruce into the mind of Edward ; 1 but at the same time he kept up to that proud rival the ap pearance of friendship and familiarity. Bruce, in the meantime, although he had matured no certain design for the recovery of the crown, never lost sight of his pretensions, and neglected no opportunity of strength ening himself and his cause, by those bands and alli ances with powerful barons and prelates, which were common in that age. He had entered into a secret league of this kind with William de Lamberton bishop of St Andrews, in which they engaged faithfully to consult together, and to give mutual assistance to each other, by themselves and their people, at all times, and against all persons, to the utmost of their power ; without guile to warn each other against all dangers, and to use their utmost endeavour to prevent them.2 1 Hemingford, p. 219, says this expressly : \" Cumque mutuo loque rentur ad invicem verbis ut videbaturpacificis, statim convertens faciem et verba pervertens c\u0153pit improperare ei.\" 2 See Ayloffe's Calendar of Ancient Charters, p. 295. The deed is transcribed in Lord Hailes' Annals, vol. i. p. 280. VOL. I. \u00b0"], [216, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1305. 210 This league was of course sedulously concealed from Edward, but it seems to have become known to Comyn, and a conference between him and Bruce on the sub ject of their rival claims actually took place. At this meeting, Bruce described in strong expressions the miserable servitude into which their mutual dissensions, and their pretensions to the crown, had plunged the country; and we are informed by one of the most ancient and accurate of the contemporary historians, that he proposed as an alternative to Comyn, either that this baron should make over his great estate to Bruce, on condition of receiving from him in return his assis tance in asserting his claim to the throne, or should agree to accept Bruce's lands, and assist him in the recovery of his hereditary kingdom. \" Support my title to the crown,\" said Bruce, \" and I will give you my estate ; or give me your estate, and I will support yours.\" x Comyn agreed to wave his right, and accept the lands ; and, in the course of these confidential meetings, became acquainted with Bruce's secret asso ciations, and even possessed of papers which contained evidence of his designs for the recovery of his rights. These designs, however, were as yet quite immature, and Bruce, who was still unsuspected, and in high confidence with Edward, repaired to the English court. Whilst there, Comyn betrayed him,2 and despatched letters to the king, informing him of the ambitious projects of Bruce. Edward, anxious to unravel the whole conspiracy, had recourse to dissimulation, and 1 Fordun a Hearne, p. 992, vol. iv. Winton, vol. ii. p. 122, says this conference took place when the two barons were \"ryding fra Strevylyn.\" See, also, Langtoft, vol. ii. p. 330. Barbour's Bruce, Jamieson's edit. p. 18. 2 Winton asserts, vol. ii. p. 123, that Comyn betrayed Bruce when he was yet in Scotland ; upon which Edward sent for him to get him into his power ; and that Bruce, suspecting nothing, repaired to Lon don to attend parliament."], [217, "ROBERT BRUCE. 211 1305. the Earl of Carrick continued in apparent favour. But the king had inadvertently dropped some hint of an intention to seize him ; and Bruce, having received from his kinsman, the Earl of Gloucester,1 an intima tion of his danger, took horse, and, accompanied by a few friends, precipitately fled to Scotland. On the borders they encountered a messenger hastening to England. His deportment was suspicious, and Bruce ordered him to be questioned and searched. He proved to be an emissary of Comyn's, whom that baron had sent to communicate with Edward. He was instantly slain, his letters were seized, and Bruce, in possession of documents which disclosed the treachery of Comyn, pressed forward to his castle of Lochmaben,2 which he reached on the fifth day after his sudden flight. Here he met his brother, Edward Bruce, and informed him of the perilous circumstances in which he was placed.3 It was now the month of February, the time when the English justiciars appointed by Edward were accus tomed to hold their courts at Dumfries ; and Bruce, as a freeholder of Annandale, was bound to be present. Comyn was also a freeholder in Dumfriesshire, and obliged to attend on the justiciars ; so that in this way those two proud rivals were brought into contact, under circumstances peculiarly irritating.* They met at Dumfries ; and Bruce, burning with ill-dissembled indignation, requested a private interview with the rival who had betrayed him, in the convent of the Minorite Friars. Comyn agreed ; and, entering the con vent, they had not reached the high altar, before words grew high and warm, and the young baron, losing com- 1 The Earl of Gloucester is ridiculously enough denominated by Maitland, vol. i. p. 469, Earl Gomer, by Boece called Glomer, which is as absurdly supposed to be a corruption of Montgomery. 2 Winton, vol. ii. p. 127. 3 Barbour, vol. i. p. 23. 4 Hailes' Annals, vol. i. p. 355."], [218, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1305. 212 mand of temper, openly arraigned Comyn of treachery. \" You lie !\" said Comyn ; upon which Bruce instantly stabbed him with his dagger, and hurrying from the sanctuary which he had defiled with blood, rushed into the street, and called, \" To horse ! \" Lindsay and Kirkpatrick, two of his followers, seeing him pale and agitated, demanded the cause. \" I doubt,\" said Bruce, as he threw himself on his horse, \" I have slain Comyn.\" \u2014 \"Do you doubt?\" cried Kirkpatrick, fiercely, \"I'll make sure!\" and instantly entered the convent) where he found the unhappy man still alive, but bleeding, and lying on the steps of the high altar. By this time the noise of the scuffle had alarmed his friends ; and his uncle, Sir Robert Comyn,1 rushing into the convent, attempted to save him. But Kirk patrick slew this new opponent, and having despatched his dying victim, who could offer no resistance, rejoined his master. Bruce now assembled his followers, and took possession of the castle of Dumfries ; whilst the English justiciars, who held their court in a hall in the castle, believing their lives to be in danger, barri caded the doors. But the building was immediately set fire to ; upon which the judges capitulated, and were permitted to depart from Scotland without further molestation.2 1 There seems some little ambiguity about the knight's name. Hailes, vol. i. p. 291, says he is commonly called Sir Richard. A book of chronicles in Peter College Library, quoted hy Leland, Coll. vol. i. p. 473, calls him Sir Roger. The pope's bull, vol. iii. Rymer, F\u0153dera, p. 810, puts it beyond doubt that his name is Robert. The murder of Comyn happened on Thursday the 10th of February, 1305-6. 3 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 220. This historian tells us, that after Bruce had with his followers seized the castle of Dumfries, and expelled the justiciars, word was brought him that Comyn was still alive, and had been carried by the friars within the high altar, to confess his sins. Upon which Bruce ordered him to be dragged out, and slain on the steps of the altar, so that the altar itself was stained with his blood. This is improbable."], [219, "1305. ROBERT BRUCE. 213 This murder had been perpetrated by Bruce and his companions in the heat of passion, and was entirely unpremeditated ; but its consequences were important and momentous. Bruce's former varying and uncer tain line of policy, which had arisen out of the hope of preserving, by fidelity to Edward, his great estates, and of seeing his rival crushed by his opposition to England, was at once changed by the murder of which he had been guilty. His whole schemes upon the crown had been laid open to Edward. This was ruin of itself; but, in addition to this, he had, with his own hand, assassinated the first noble in the realm, and in a place of tremendous sanctity. He had stained the high altar with blood, and had directed against him self, besides the resentment of the powerful friends and vassals of the murdered earl, all the terrors of religion, and the strongest prejudices of the people. The die, howTever, was cast, and he had no alternative left to him, but either to become a fugitive and an outlaw, or to raise open banner against Edward ; and, although the disclosure of his plans was premature, to proclaim his title to the crown. Having determined on this last, he repaired immediately to Lochmaben castle, and despatched letters to his friends and adhe rents. It was fortunate for him at this trying crisis, that he had secured the friendship and assistance of the Archbishop of St Andrews, William de Lamber ton, by one of those bands or covenants, which, in this ao-e, it was considered an unheard-of outrage to break or disregard. Lamberton's friendship disarmed of its dreadful consequences that sentence of excommunica tion, which was soon thundered against him, and his powerful influence necessarily interested in his behalf the whole body of the Scottish clergy. The desperate nature of Bruce's undertaking ap-"], [220, "214 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1305. peared very manifest, from the small number of adhe rents who joined his fortunes. The enumeration will not occupy much space. It embraced the Earls of Lennox and of Athole ; Lamberton the Bishop of St Andrews ; Robert Wishart bishop of Glasgow ; David bishop of Moray; the Abbot of Scone ; his four brothers, Edward, Nigel, Thomas, and Alexander ; his nephew, Thomas Randolph ; his brother-in-law, Christopher Seton ; Gilbert de la Haye of Errol, with his brother, Hugh de la Haye ; David Barclay of Cairns ; Alexan der Fraser, brother of Simon Fraser, of Oliver Castle ; Walter de Somerville, of Linton and Carnwath ; David of Inchmartin ; Robert Boyd ; and Robert Fleming. Such was the handful of brave men, comprising two earls and only fourteen barons, with whose assistance Bruce determined to take the field against the over whelming power of England, directed by one of the most experienced statesmen, and certainly by the most successful military commander of the age. \" With these,\" says the authentic and affectionate Fordun, \" he had the courage to raise his hand, not only against the King of England and his allies, but against the whole accumulated power of Scotland, with the ex ception of an extremely small number who adhered to him, and who seemed like a drop of water when com pared to the ocean.\"1 1 \" There is no living man,\" continues the historian, \" who is able to narrate the story of those complicated misfortunes which befell him in the commencement of this war ; his frequent perils, his re treats, the care and weariness, the hunger and thirst, the watching and fasting, the cold and nakedness, to which he exposed his person ; the exile into which he was driven, the snares and ambushes which he escaped, the seizure, imprisonment, the execution, and utter de struction of his dearest friends and relatives. . . . And if, in addition to these almost innumerable and untoward events, which he ever bore with a cheerful and unconquered spirit, any man should undertake to describe his individual conflicts and personal successes, those courageous and single-handed combats, in which, by the favour"], [221, "ROBERT BRUCE. 1306. 215 Bruce's first step was bold and decisive. He deter mined immediately to be crowned at Scone ; and for this purpose repaired from his castle of Lochmaben to Glasgow, where he was joined by some of the friends who supported his enterprise. On the road from Lochmaben, a young knight, well armed and horsed, encountered his retinue, who, the moment Bruce approached, threw himself from his horse, and kneel ing, did homage to him as his sovereign. He was immediately recognized as Sir James Douglas, the son of William, the fourth Lord Douglas, whose estate had been given by Edward to the Lord Clifford, and was affectionately welcomed ; for his father had fought with Wallace, and the son had already shown some indications of his future greatness. Douglas imme diately joined the little band who rode with Bruce ; and thus commenced a friendship which, after a series of as noble services as ever subject paid to sovereign, was not dissolved even by death : for it was to this tried follower that in after years his dying master committed his heart to be carried to Jerusalem.1 From Glasgow, Bruce rode to Scone, and there was solemnly crowned, on Friday the 27th of March. Edward had carried off the ancient regalia of the king dom, and the famous stone chair, in which, according to ancient custom, the Scottish kings were inaugu rated. But the ready care of Wishart bishop of Glasgow, supplied from his own wardrobe the robes of God, and his own great strength and courage, he would often penetrate into the thickest of the enemy, now becoming the assailant, and cutting down all who opposed him ; at another time acting on the defensive, and evincing equal talents in escaping from what seemed inevitable death ; if any writer shall do this, he will prove, if I am not mistaken, that he had no equal, in his own time, either in knightly prowess, or in strength and vigour of body.\" \u2014 Fordun a Hearne, vol. v. p. 998. 1 Barbour, by Jamieson, p. 27."], [222, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1306. 216 in which Robert appeared at his coronation ; and a slight coronet of gold,1 probably borrowed by the Abbot of Scone from some of the saints or kings which adorned his abbey, was employed instead of the here ditary crown. A banner, wrought with the arms of Baliol, was delivered by the Bishop of Glasgow to the new king ; and Robert received beneath it the homage of the prelates and earls who attended the ceremony. On the second day after the coronation, and before Bruce and his friends had left Scone, they were sur prised by the sudden arrival of Isabella countess of Buchan, sister of the Earl of Fife, who immediately claimed the privilege of placing the king upon the throne. It was a right which had undoubtedly be longed to the earls of Fife from the days of Malcolm Canmore ; and as the Earl of Fife was at this time of the English party, the countess, a high-spirited woman, leaving her home, joined Bruce at Scone, bringing with her the war-horses of her husband.2 The new king was not in a condition to think lightly of any thing of this nature. To have refused Isabella's request, might give to his enemies some colour for alleging, that an essential pai't of the ancient solem nity had been omitted in his coronation. The English historians would have us believe that the lady was influenced by tenderer feelings than ambition or policy ; but this is doubtful.

Bruce next made a progress through various parts of Scotland, strengthening his party by the accession of new partisans ; seizing some of the castles and towns which were in the possession of the enemy ; commit ting to prison the sheriffs and officers of Edward ; J and creating so great a panic, that many of the English fled precipitately from the country. His party, never theless, was small ; the Comyns possessed the greatest power in Scotland, and they and their followers opposed him, not only from motives of policy, but with the deepest feelings of feudal enmity and revenge ; while many earls and barons, who had suffered in the late wars, preferred the quiet of submission to the repeated hazards of insurrection and revolt. Edward had returned to Winchester, from a plea sure tour through the counties of Dorset and Hamp shire, wThen he received the intelligence of the murder of Comyn and the revolt of Bruce. Although not an aged mau, he had reached the mature period of sixty five ; and a constant exposure to the fatigues of war, had begun to make an impression upon a constitution of great natural strength. He was become unwieldy, and so infirm, that he could not mount on horseback or lead his armies ; and after twenty years of ambi tious intrigue, and almost uninterrupted war, now that he was in the decline of his strength and years, he found his Scottish conquests about to be wrested from him by a rival, in whom he had placed the greatest confidence. But although broken in body, this great king was, in his mind and spirit, yet vigor ous and unimpaired, as was soon evinced by the rapi- 1 Rymer, Foedeia, vol. ii. p. 988."], [224, "1306. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 218 dity and decision of his orders, and the subsequent magnitude of his preparations. He instantly sent to strengthen the frontier garrisons of Berwick and Car lisle, with the intention of securing the English bor ders on that side from invasion ; and he appointed the Earl of Pembroke, with Lord Robert Clifford and Henry Percy, to march into Scotland, directing them to proceed against his rebels in that kingdom.1 This was, in an eminent degree, the age of chivalry ; and Edward, who had himself gained renown in Palestine, availed himself of that imposing system to give greater spirit to his intended expedition. He published a manifesto, declaring his intention of bestowing knight hood upon his son, the Prince of Wales ; and he caused it to be proclaimed over England, that as many young esquires as had a right to claim knighthood, should appear at Westminster on the feast of Pente cost, and receive that honour along with the son of their sovereign, after which they should accompany him in his Scottish war. On the day appointed, three hundred young gentlemen, the flower of the English youth, with a brilliant assemblage of pages and at tendants, crowded before the king's palace ; which being too small for so great a concourse, orders were given to cut down the trees in the orchard of the New Temple. In this ample space, the novices pitched their pavilions ; and the king, with a splendid muni ficence, distributed to them from his royal wardrobe, the scarlet cloth, fine linen, and embroidered belts, made use of on such occasions. Habited in these, 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, new edition, vol. i. part ii. p. 982. Math. West minster, p. 454.

Next morning Edward, with great pomp, knighted his son in the palace ; and the prince, after having received the belt and spurs, came to the abbey church to confer the same honour upon the young esquires who were there waiting for him, with an immense concourse of spectators. This crowd was the cause of giving additional solemnity to the spec tacle ; for the prince was obliged, from the press, to mount the steps of the high altar ; and on this sacred spot, amid the assembled chivalry of England, he con ferred the rank of knighthood upon his three hundred companions. He and his companions then proceeded to the banquet, at which two swans, ornamented with golden net-work, emblems in those days of constancy and truth, were brought in. Upon their being placed on the table, the king rose and made a solemn vow to God and to the swans, that he would set out for Scot land, there avenge the death of John Comyn, punish the treachery of the Scots, and afterwards embark for the holy Avar, with the resolution to die in Palestine.1 After this strange and irreverent adjuration, he next addressed his son, and made him promise, that if he died before he took this journey, he should carry his body with the army into Scotland, and not commit it to the earth until he had obtained the victory over his enemies. The clergy and laity then agreed to contri bute a thirtieth, and the merchants a tenth, towards defraying the expenses of the war. The prince and the barons promised faithfully to perform these commands of their sovereign ; and having agreed to 1 Hailes, vol, ii. p. 4."], [226, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1306. 220 meet at Carlisle fifteen days after Midsummer, they returned home to make preparations for war.1 The Earl of Pembroke, with Clifford and Henry Percy, soon hastened into Scotland ; and the Prince of Wales, with his knights-companions, followed in the rear of their army ; whilst Edward himself, unable from vio lent fatigue, proceeded towards Carlisle by slow jour neys. It was an ill commencement of the young prince's chivalry, that his excessive cruelty in ravag ing the country, and sparing neither age nor sex, in curred the censure of his father the king, who was him self little wont to be scrupulous on these occasions.2 Bruce was unfortunate in the early part of his career; and his military talents, which afterwards conducted him through a course of unexampled victory, were nursed amid scenes of incessant hardship and defeat. After having ravaged Galloway,3 he marched towards Perth, at that time a town walled and strongly fortified, where the Earl of Pembroke lay with a small army of soldiers. Bruce, on arriving at Perth, and finding the earl shut up within the walls, sent a chal lenge, requesting him, in the chivalrous style of the age, to come out and try his fortune in an open field. Pembroke answered that the day was too far spent, but that he would fight with him next morning ; upon which the king retired, and encamped about a mile from Perth, in the wood of Methven. Towards even ing, whilst his soldiers were busy cooking their supper,4 and many were dispersed in foraging parties, a cry was heard that the enemy were upon them ; and Pembroke, with his whole army, which outnumbered the Scots by fifteen hundred men, broke in upon the 1 Math.

He and his friends had scarcely time to arm them selves. They made, however,-a stout resistance; and at the first onset Bruce attacked the Earl of Pem broke, and slew7 his horse ; but no efforts of individual courage could restore order, or long delay defeat ; and the battle of Methven was from the first nearly a rout. The king was thrice unhorsed, and once so nearly taken, that the captor, Sir Philip de Mowbray, called aloud that he had the new-made king, when Sir Chris topher Seton felled Mowbray to the earth, and rescued his master.2 The king's brother, Edward Bruce, Bruce himself, the Earl of Athole, Sir James Douglas, Sir Gilbert de la Haye, Sir Nigel Campbell, and Sir William de Barondoun,3 with about five hundred men, kept the field, and at last effected their retreat into the fastnesses of Athole ; but some of his best and bravest friends fell into the hands of the enemy. Sir David de Berklay, Sir Hugh de la Haye, Sir Alex ander Fraser, Sir John de Somerville, Sir David Inchmartin, and Thomas Randolph, then a young esquire, were all taken, along with Hugh, a chaplain.4 On being informed of the victory, Edward gave orders for the instant execution of the prisoners ; but the 1 Barbour, by Jamieson, p. 37. 2 Barbour, pp. 35, 30.

Randolph, on being pardoned, deserted his uncle ; others were ran somed ; whilst the chaplain, with other knights who had been taken, were hanged and quartered.1 Bruce and his friends now began to feel the miseries of outlaws. A high price was set on his head, and he was compelled to harbour in the hills, deprived of the common comforts of life. He and his followers presented a ragged and wretched appearance. Their shoes were worn off their feet by constant toil in a mountainous country ; and hunting, in better days a joyful pastime, became a necessitous occupation. At length want and distress drove him and his little band into the low country ; and at Aberdeen, his brother, Sir Nigel Bruce, met him with his queen and other ladies, determined to share the pains of war and banishment with their husbands and their fathers.2 Here, after enjoying a short season of solace and re spite, a report was brought of the near advance of the English ; and the king and his friends, accompanied by their faithful women, retreated into Breadalbane.3 And now, if already they had experienced distress, it was, we may believe, greatly aggravated by the presence of those whose constitutions were little able to struggle against cold and hunger, and whose love, as it was of that sterling kind which was ready to share in every privation, only made the hearts of their husbands and fathers more keenly alive to their sufferings.

The roots and berries of the wroods, the venison caught in the chase, the fish which abounded in the mountain rivers, supplied them with food \u2014 the warm skins of deer and roe with bedding \u2014 and all laboured to promote their comfort ; but none with such success as the brave and gallant Sir James Douglas. This young soldier, after the imprisonment and death of his father, had been educated at the polished court of France ; 1 and whilst his indefatigable perseverance in the chase afforded them innumerable comforts, his sprightly temper and constant gaiety, comforted the king, and amused his forlorn companions.2 They had now reached the head of Tay, and deeper distresses seemed gathering round them, for the season was fast approaching when it was impossible for wo men to exist in that remote and wild region ; and they were on the borders of the Lord of Lorn's country, a determined enemy of Bruce, who had married the aunt of the murdered Comyn.3 Lorn immediately collected a thousand men, and, with the barons of Argyle, besetting the passes, hemmed in the king, and attacked him in a narrow defile, where Bruce and his small band of knights could not manage their horses. The High landers were on foot ; and, armed with that dreadful weapon, the Lochaber axe, did great execution. Sir James Douglas, with Gilbert de la Haye, were both wounded, and many of the horses severely cut and gashed ; so that the king, dreading the total destruc tion of his little band, managed to get them together, and having placed himself in the rear, between them and the men of Lorn, commenced his retreat, halting at intervals, and driving back the enemy, when they 1 Hume's History of House of Douglas and Angus, p. 37. 2 Barbour, vol. i. p. 40. 3 Barbour, p. 41 3 Barbour, p. 41"], [230, "1306. 224 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. pressed too hard upon them. It was in one of these skirmishes that Bruce, who, in the use of his weapons, was esteemed inferior to no knight of his time, with his own hand killed three soldiers, who attacked him at the same time and at a disadvantage,1 \u2014 a feat which is said to have extorted even from his enemies the praise of superior chivalry. Having thus again escaped, a council was held, and it was resolved that the queen and her ladies should be conducted to the strong castle of Kildrummie, in Mar, under an escort commanded by young Nigel Bruce, the king's brother, and John earl of Athole. The king, with only two hundred men, and beset on all sides by his enemies, was left to make his way through Lennox to Kentire, a district which, from the influence of Sir Neil Campbell, who was then with him, he expected would be somewhat more friendly. He now gave up all the horses to those who were to escort the women, and having de termined to pursue his way on foot, took a melancholy farewell of his queen.2 It was the last time he ever saw his brother, who soon after was taken, and fell a victim to the implacable revenge of Edward. Bruce, meanwhile, pressed on through Perthshire to Loch Lomond. On the banks of this lake his progress was suddenly arrested. To have travelled round it, would have been accomplished at great risk, when every hour, which could convey him beyond the pursuit of his enemies, was of value. After some time, they suc ceeded in discovering a little boat, which, from its crazy and leaky state, could hold but three persons, 1 Barbour, p. 44.

In it, the king, Sir James Douglas, and another, who rowed them, first passed over. They then despatched it in return for the rest ; so that the whole band at length succeeded in reaching the other side. Amid these complicated dangers and distresses, the spirit of their royal master wonderfully supported his followers. His memory was stored with the tales of romance, so popular in that chivalrous age ; and in recounting the sufferings of their fabled heroes, he is said to have diverted the minds of his friends from brooding too deeply on their own.1 They began now to feel the misery of hunger; and in traversing the woods in search of food, they encountered the Earl of Lennox, who, since the unfortunate defeat at Methven, had heard nothing of the fate of his sovereign. Lennox fell on his master's neck, and the king wept in embracing him. But even this natural burst of grief proved dangerous, by occupying too much time; for the enemy were now pressing on their track, and every thing depended on Bruce's gaining the coast, w7here he expected to meet Sir Neil Campbell, whom he had sent in advance. This he fortunately accomplished ; and Campbell, with a few boats which he had collected, conveyed the monarch and his followers to the coast of Kentire, where they were hospitably received by Angus of Isla lord of Kentire. From thence, deem ing himself still insecure, he passed over with three hundred in his company, to the little island of Rach rin, situated on the northern coast of Ireland, amid whose rude but friendly inhabitants he buried himself from the pursuit of his enemies.2 Edward, on hearing of the escape of Bruce, proceeded 1 Barbour, vol. i. pp. 53, 54. VOL. I. 2 Ibid. p. 62. P"], [232, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1306. 226 with his usual severity against his enemies. He pub lished at Lanercost, where he then lay, on his road to Scotland, an ordinance, by which all who were guilty of the death of John Comyn, were sentenced to be drawn and hanged ; and he decreed, that the same extremity of punishment should be inflicted on such as either advised or assented, or, after the fact, know ingly received them. It was added, that any persons who were in arms against the king, either before or since the battle of Methven, as well as all who were willingly of the party of Robert Bruce, or who assisted the people in rising contrary to law, were, on convic tion, to be imprisoned ; and it was commanded, that every subject of the king should levy hue and cry upon all who had been in arms against England, and under the penalty of imprisonment, and loss of their estates, apprehend such offenders dead or alive. Finally, as to the common people of Scotland, who, contrary to their inclination, might by their lords have been com pelled to rise in arms, the guardian was permitted to fine and ransom them according to their offences.1 These orders were rigorously carried into execution; and the terror of the king's vengeance induced some of the Scottish barons to act with meanness. Bruce's queen,2 and his daughter Marjory, thinking themselves insecure in the castle of Kildrummie, which was threatened by the English army, had taken refuge in the sanctuary of St Duthac, at Tain, in Ross-shire, and were treacherously given up to the English by the Earl of Ross, who violated the sanctuary, and made them, and the knights who escorted them, prisoners. These brave men were immediately put to death, and 1 Tyrrel, Hist, of England, vol. iii. p. 174 ; and Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. i. part ii. p. 995, new edit. 8 A daughter of the Earl of Ulster."], [233, "1306.

A more severe fate awaited the Countess of Buchan, who had dared to place the king upon the throne, and who was soon after taken. In one of the outer turrets of the castle of Berwick, was constructed a cage, latticed and cross-barred witli wood, and secured -with iron, in which this unfortunate lady wras immured. No person was permitted to speak with her except the women who brought her food, and it was carefully stipulated that these should be of English extraction. Confined in this rigorous manner, and yet subjected to the gaze of every passer-by, she remained for four years shut up, till she was released from her misery, and sub jected to a milder imprisonment 2 in the monastery of Mount Carmel, in Berwick. Mary and Christina, both sisters to the Scottish king, were soon after made prisoners. Mary was confined in a cage similar to that of the Countess of Buchan, built for her in one of the turrets of Roxburgh castle ; 3 and Christina was delivered to Henry Percy, who shut her up in a convent. Immediately after the battle of Methven, the troops of the Earl of Pembroke, in scouring the country, took prisoners, Lamberton bishop of St Andrews, and the Abbot of Scone, who were found clad in armour, and conveyed them in fetters to England.4 Soon 1 F\u0153dera, vol. ii. pp. 1013, 1014.

They had strenuously supported Bruce by their great influence, as well as by their money and their armed vassals ; and Edward, after commanding them to be imprisoned in irons, within different castles, wrote to the pope, requesting that, in consequence of their treason against him, William Comyn, brother to the Earl of Buchan, and Geoffrey de Mowbray, should be appointed to the vacant sees of St Andrews and Glasgow \u2014 a proposal with which his holiness does not appear to have complied.2 The next victim excited deeper commiseration. Bruce's youthful brother, Nigel, had shut himself up in the castle of Kildrummie, and( there defied the English army, commanded by the Earls of Lancaster and Hereford. After a brave defence, the treachery of one of the garrison, who set fire to the magazine of corn, and destroyed their supplies, compelled them to surrender. The beautiful person and engaging man ners of Nigel Bruce,3 rendered his fate a subject of horror and indignation to the Scots, and excited senti ments of pity in every bosom but that of Edward. He was sent to Berwick, there condemned by a special commission, hanged, and afterwards beheaded.4 Along with him divers other knights and soldiers suffered the 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. i. part ii. new edit. p. 996. 2 Prynne, Edward I., p. 1156.

He was im mediately hurried to Dumfries, aud condemned and hanged as a traitor. So dear to King Robert was the memory of this faithful friend and fellow-warrior, that he afterwards erected on the spot where he was exe cuted a little chapel, where mass was said for his soul.3 Sir Christopher's brother, John de Seton, was taken about the same time, aud put to death at New castle. The Earl of Athole, who was allied to the King of England, had been present at the coronation of Bruce, and had fought for him at the battle of Methven. In attempting to escape beyond seas, he was driven back by a tempest, and fell into the hands of the enemy. Edward, on hearing of his being taken, although he then lay dangerously sick, expressed great exultation ; and while some interceded for Athole, on account of the royal blood which flowed in his veins, swore, that his only distinction should be a higher gallows than his fellow-traitors. Nor was this an empty threat. He was carried to London, tried and condemned in Westminster Hall, and hanged upon a gallows fifty feet high. He was then cut down half dead, his bowels taken out and burnt before his face, and at last 1 Scala Chronica, p. 131. 2 Robertson's Index, p. 135-8. Notes and Illustrations, letter X. 3 Stat.

Fraser was a veteran soldier ; his life had been spent in war both at home and on the continent, and he enjoyed a high reputation. With a small force which he had collected, he made a last effort for the national liberty at Kirkencliff, near Stirling, but was entirely routed, and forced to surrender himself prisoner to Sir Thomas de Multon. Many knights and squires were taken along with him, whilst others fell on the field, or were drowned in the river.2 This warrior enjoyed great popularity in Scotland, as the last friend and follower of Wallace ; and the severity, and studied indignity, with which he was treated by Edward, remind us of the trial and execution of that heroic person. He was carried to London heavily ironed, with his legs tied under his horse's belly, and, as he passed through the city, a garland of periwinkle was in mockery placed upon his head. He was then lodged in the Tower, along with his squire, Thomas de Boys, and Sir Herbert de Morham, a Scottish knight of French extraction, whose courage and manly deportment are commemorated in a contemporary English ballad. Fraser was tried and condemned, after which he suf fered the death of a traitor, with all its circumstances of refined cruelty. He was hanged, cut down when still living, and beheaded ; his bowels were then torn 1 Math. Westminster, p. 456. 2 The old contemporary ballad, printed from the Harleian MS. by Pinkerton, in his Maitland Poems, vol. ii. p. 488, says, that Fraser, at the battle of Kirkencliff, beside Stirling, surrendered to Sir Thomas de Multon and to Sir John Jose."], [237, "ROBERT BRUCE. 1306. 231 out and burned, and his head fixed beside that of Wallace upon London Bridge.1 The trunk was hung in chains, and strictly guarded, lest his friends should remove it. Herbert de Morham, who had been im prisoned and forfeited in 1297, and liberated under the promise of serving Edward in his Flemish war,2 next suffered death, and with him Thomas Boys. To these victims of Edward's resentment we may add the names of Sir David Inchmartin, Sir John de Somerville, Sir Walter Logan, and many others of inferior note. After the disgusting details of these executions, the reader will be disposed to smile at the remark of a late acute historian, that the execution of the Scottish prisoners is insufficient to load Edward's memory with the charge of cruelty.3 To complete the ruin of Bruce, it only remained to dispose of his great estates, and to excommunicate him, as guilty of murder and sacrilege. His lordship of Annandale was bestowed on the Earl of Hereford, his maternal estate of Car rick given to Henry Percy; and the Lord Robert Clifford, with others of EdwTard's nobles, shared the rich English estates, which had long been hereditary in this powerful family.4 In the end of February, the Cardinal St Sabinus, 1 Math.

On the approach of spring, having received some assistance from Christina of the Isles, he began to meditate a descent upon Scotland, and first despatched Sir James Douglas and Sir Robert Boyd on an ad venture to the island of Arran. Douglas found it occupied by Sir John Hastings, an English knight, who held the castle of Brodick with a strong garrison ; and having laid an ambuscade, he had the good fortune to surprise the under-warden of the castle, and, after killing forty of his soldiers, to make himself master of a valuable cargo of provisions, arms, and clothing. This proved a seasonable supply to the king, wTho soon after arrived from Rachrin with a fleet of thirty-three galleys, and in his company about three hundred men. Ignorant of the situation of the enemy, he first de spatched a messenger from Arran into his own country of Carrick, with instructions, if he found the people well affected, to light a fire, at a day appointed, upon an eminence near Turnberry castle. When the day arrived, Bruce, who watched in extreme anxiety for the signal, about noon perceived a light in the expected direction, and instantly embarked, steering, as night came on, by the light of the friendly beacon.2 Mean while, his messenger bad also seen the fire, and, dread- J Hemingford, p. 226. 2 Barbour, pp. 83, 84."], [239, "1306-7.

This was said in the true spirit of a knight-errant ; but his royal brother, who was playing a game of which the stake was a kingdom, might be allowed to hesitate. His naturally fearless and sanguine temper, however, got the better ; and dismissing caution, he determined to remain, and, as it was still night, to attack the English quarters. The plan succeeded. The enemy, cantoned in careless security, in the houses and ham lets round the castle of Turnberry, were easily sur prised and put to the sword ; while Percy, hearing the tumult, and ignorant of the small number of the Scots, did not dare to attempt a rescue, but shutting himself up in the castle, left a rich booty to the assailants, amongst which were his war-horses and his household plate.1 There was a romantic interest about Bruce's for tunes, which had a powerful effect upon the female mind ; and the hero himself seems to have been willing to avail himself of this influence.2 He had already received assistance from the Countess of Buchan and 5 Barbour, p. 105, line 541. 1 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 225."], [240, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1306-7. 234 Christina of the Isles ; and now, on hearing of his success in Carrick, he was joined by a lady, nearly related to him, but whose name has been lost. She brought him, however, a seasonable supply of money and provisions, and a reinforcement of forty men. From her, too, he first learnt the miserable fate of Seton, Athole, and the garrison of Kildrummie ; and, during the recital, is said to have vowed deeply that their deaths should not go unrevenged. Meanwhile his success spread a panic among the English ; for although Ayr castle was in the hands of Edward, neither its garrison nor that of Turnberry, under Percy, dared to make head against him. At length, Sir Roger St John marched from Northum berland with a body of a thousand men : covered by this force, Henry Percy, with the remains of his garrison, evacuated Turnberry, and hurried into Eng land;1 whilst Bruce, unable to oppose St John, re tired into the mountainous parts of Carrick. Here the adventurous spirit of James Douglas could not long remain inactive. He knew that Lord Clifford, on whom Edward had bestowed his hereditary domain, held his castle of Douglas with a strong garrison ; and having obtained the king's permission, he travelled in disguise into Douglasdale, and, after carefully observ ing the strength and position of the enemy, discovered himself to Dickson, a faithful servant, in whose house he lay concealed. Here, night after night, did his principal vassals assemble, rejoiced again to find the son of their old lord; and thus, unknown to the English, a little band of determined foes was nursed amongst them, who watched every step they took, and were ready to fall upon them the first moment 1 Barbour, vol. i. p. 95. Trivet, p. 344."], [241, "1307. ROBERT BRUCE. 235 that promised an advantage. This soon presented it self. The garrison, on Palm Sunday, marched out to the neighbouring church of St Bride, leaving the castle undefended. Some of Douglas's followers, with con cealed arms, entered the church along with them, and in a moment when they least suspected, the English heard the cry of \"Douglas!\" and found themselves attacked both from without and within. After a stout resistance, and much bloodshed, the church was won and many prisoners taken. Having thus cut off the garrison, Douglas first plundered the castle of the arms and valuables which could be carried off. This done, he raised a huge pile of the malt and corn which he found in the stores, staved the casks of wine and other liquors, and threw them on the heap, after which he slew his prisoners, and cast their dead bodies on the pile. He then set fire to this savage hecatomb, and consumed it and the halls of his fathers in the blaze.1 This cruel transaction, which is said to have been intended as a sacrifice to the manes of his faith ful servant Dickson, who w7as slain in the church, is still remembered in the tradition of the country by the name of the Douglas' Larder. This success, however, was more than balanced by a grievous disaster which about this time befell Bruce. He had despatched his brothers, Thomas and Alex ander, into Ireland, where they had the good fortune to collect a force of seven hundred men, with which they crossed over to Loch Ryan in Galloway. But their approach to the coast had been watched by Macdowall, a chieftain of that country, who was in 1 Hume's House of Douglas and Angus, vol. i. pp. 50, 51. Bar bour, pp. 100, 101.

Many perished in the sea, and the rest were either slain or taken prisoners. Of the prisoners, those of note were Bruce's brothers, Thomas and Alexander, with Sir Reginald Crawford, who were all grievously wounded. Malcolm Mackail lord of Kentire, along with two Irish reguli or chiefs, were found amongst the slain. Macdowall, with savage exultation, cut off their heads, and presented them, and his illustrious prisoners, bleeding and almost dead, to the king at Carlisle.1 Edward commanded the two Bruces and Crawford to be instantly executed. Thus, within a few short months, had the king to lament the cruel death of three brothers, that of his dear friends, Seton, Athole, and Fraser; besides the imprisonment of his queen and his daughter. Deprived of this reinforcement, the king began to be in great difficulties. The English hotly pursued him, and even had the meanness to lay plots for his assassination, whilst the Galwegians endeavoured to hunt him down with bloodhounds.2 On one of these occasions, when only sixty soldiers were in his com pany, he made a narrow escape. It was near night fall, when his scouts informed him that a force of two hundred soldiers were on the way to attack them. He instantly crossed a mountain river hard by, of which the banks were steep and wooded, and drew up his men in a swampy level about two bowshots off. He 1 Math. Westminster, pp. 457, 458.

ROBERT BRUCE. 237 then commanded them to lie still, while he and Sir Gilbert de la Haye went forward to reconnoitre. The ground was well fitted for defence. A steep path led up from the brink of the river to the summit of the bank, and Bruce took his stand at the gorge, where it was so narrow that the superior numbers of the enemy gave them little advantage. Here he listened for some time, till, at length, the baying of a hound told him of the approach of the Galwegians ; and by the light of the moon he could see their band crossing the river, and pressing up the path. He instantly despatched De la Haye to rouse and bring up his little force, whilst he remained alone to defend the pass. The fierce mountaineers were soon upon him ; but, although mounted and armed after their own fashion, they stood little chance against so powerful an adversary as Bruce, clothed in steel, and having the advantage of the ground. One only could attack him at a time ; and as he pressed boldly but blindly forward, he was transfixed in a moment by the spear ; whilst his horse, borne down to the earth, and in stantly stabbed, blocked up the path in such a way that the next soldier must charge over his body. He, too, with many of his companions, successively but vainly endeavoured to carry the pass. They were met by the dreadful sword of the king, which swept round on every side. Numbers now fell, and formed a ghastly barrier around him ; so that, on the ap proach of his men, the Galwegians drew off, and gave up the pursuit. When the soldiers came up, they found Bruce wearied, but unwounded, and sitting on a bank, where he had cast off his helmet to wipe his brow, and cool himself in the night air. In this man ner, partly by his own valour, and partly from the private information which he received from those"], [244, "238 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1307. kindly disposed to him, he escaped the various toils with which he was beset ; and as he still counted amongst his party some of the bravest and most ad venturous soldiers in Scotland, it often happened that when his fortunes seemed sinking to the lowest ebb, some auspicious adventure occurred, which reanimated the hopes of the party, and encouraged them to perse vere. The castle of Douglas had been rebuilt by the English. It was again attacked by its terrible mas ter, the \" Good Sir James ; \" and although he failed in getting it into his hands, its captain was slain, and a great part of its garrison put to the sword -,1 after which, having heard that the Earl of Pembroke, with a large force, was marching against the king, who still lay in the mountainous parts of Carrick, Douglas joined his sovereign, and awaited their advance. Bruce had now been well trained. He was familiarly acquainted with this partisan kind of warfare ; and it was his custom, when keenly pursued, to make his soldiers disperse in small companies, first appointing a place of rendezvous, where they should reassemble when the danger was over. Trusting to this plan, and to his own personal courage and skill, he did not hesitate, with only four hundred men, to await the attack of Pembroke's army, which had been reinforced, by John of Lorn, with eight hundred Highlanders, familiar with war in a mountainous country, and well trained to act in the moors and morasses of this wild region. Lorn is, moreover, reported to have taken along with him a large bloodhound, which had once belonged to the king, and whose instinctive attach ment was thus meanly employed against its old mas ter.2 The Highland chief contrived so successfully to 1 Barbour, p. 122. 2 Ibid., p. 124."], [245, "1307. ROBERT BRUCE. 239 conceal his men, that Bruce, whose attention was fixed chiefly on Pembroke's force, found his position unexpectedly attacked by Lorn in the rear, and by the English, with whom was his own nephew, Randolph, in the front. His brother, Edward Bruce, and Sir James Douglas, were now with him ; and, after mak ing head for a short time, they divided their little force into three companies, and dispersed amongst the mountains. He trusted that he might thus have a fairer chance of escape ; but the bloodhound instantly fell upon the track of the king ; and the treacherous Lorn, with his mountaineers, had almost run him down, when the animal wras transfixed by an arrow from one of the fugitives, and Bruce, with great diffi culty, escaped.1 In this pursuit, it is said, that with his own hand he slew five of the enemy ; which, as the men of Lorn were probably half naked and ill armed mountaineers, who had to measure weapons with an adversary fully accoutred, and of uncommon personal strength, is in no respect unlikely to be true. Bruce, however, had the misfortune to lose his banner, which was taken by Randolph, then fighting in the ranks of the English.2 It was an age of chivalrous adventure ; the circumstances in which the king was placed, when related even in the simplest manner, are marked by a deep and romantic interest ; and, re nouncing every thing in the narrative of his almost contemporary biographer, which looks like poetical embellishment, the historian must be careful to omit no event which is consistent with the testimony of authentic writers, with the acknowledged prowess of this great man, and the character of the times in which he lived. s ibid. 1 Barbour, pp. 129, 132."], [246, "1307. 240 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Not long after this adventure, Bruce attacked and put to the sword a party of two hundred English sol diers, carelessly cantoned at a small distance from the main army ; and the Earl of Pembroke, after an unsuccessful skirmish in Glentruel, where the wooded and marshy nature of the country incapacitated his cavalry from acting with effect, became disgusted with his ill success, and retreated to Carlisle.1 The king instantly came down upon the plains of Ayrshire, made himself master of the strengths of the country, and reduced the whole of Kyle, Carrick, and Cunning ham, to his obedience ; while Sir James Douglas, ever on the alert, attacked and discomfited Sir Philip Mowbray,2 who, with a thousand men, was marching from Bothwell into Kyle, and with difficulty escaped to the castle of Innerkip, then held by an English garrison. By these fortunate events, the followers of Bruce were inspired with that happy confidence in his skill and courage, which, even in the very different warfare of our own days, is one. principal cause of success : and he soon found his little army reinforced by such numbers, that he determined, on the first opportunity, to try his strength against the English in an open field. Nor was this opportunity long of presenting itself. The Earl of Pembroke, in the beginning of May, and soon after the defeat of Mowbray, advanced with a body of men-at-arms into Ayrshire, and came up with the enemy at Loudon Hill. It is said, that, in the spirit of the times, Pembroke challenged the Scottish king to give him battle ; and that, having sent word 1 Barbour, p. 149. 2 Ibid., vol. i. p. 153.

ROBERT BRUCE. 241 that he intended to march by Loudon Hill, Bruce, who was then with his little army at Galston, con ceiving the ground to be as favourable as could be chosen, agreed to meet him at Loudon Hill on the 10th of May. The road, at that part of Loudon Hill where he determined to wait the advance of the Eng lish, led through a piece of dry level ground about five hundred yards in breadth, which was bounded on both sides by extensive morasses ; but, deeming that this open space would give the English cavalry too much room to act, he took the precaution to secure his flanks by three parallel lines of deep trenches, which he drew on either hand from the morasses to the road, leaving an interval sufficient for the movements of a battalion of six hundred spearmen, the whole available force wThich Bruce could then bring into the field. A rabble of ill-armed countrymen and camp-followers were stationed, with his baggage, in the rear.1 Early in the morning, the king, who was on the watch, descried the advance of Pembroke, whose force, he knew, amounted to three thousand cavalry. Their appear ance, with the sun gleaming upon the coat armour of the knights, the steel harness of the horses, and the pennons and banners, of various colours, waving above the wood of spears, was splendid and imposing, con trasted with Bruce's small force.2 Yet, confident in the strength of his position, he calmly awaited their attack. The result entirely justified his expectations, and proved how dreadful a weapon the long Scottish spear might be made, when skilfully directed and used against cavalry. Pembroke had divided his force 1 The account of this battle is taken entirely from Barbour, p. 155. The English historians all allow that Pembroke was beaten, but give no particulars. 2 Barbour, p. 157. VOL. I. Q."], [248, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1307. 242 into two lines ; and, by his orders, the first line put their spears in rest, and charged the battalion of the Scots at full gallop. But they made no impression. The Scottish soldiers stood perfectly firm; many of the English were unhorsed and slain ; and, in a short time, the first division, thrown into disorder, fell back upon the second, which, in its turn, as the Scots steadily advanced with their extended spears, began to waver, to break, and at last to fly. Bruce was not slow to follow up his advantage, and completely dis persed the enemy, but without much slaughter or many prisoners, the Scots having no force in cavalry. The victory, however, had the best effect. Pembroke retired to the castle of Ayr. The Scottish army ac quired additional confidence : its ranks were every day recruited ; and, awaking from their foolish dreams of confidence and superiority, the English began to feel and to dread the great military talents which the king had acquired during the constant perils to which he had been exposed. Only three days after the retreat of Pembroke, he attacked, and with great slaughter defeated, Ralph Monthermer earl of Gloucester, an other of Edward's captains, whom he so hotly pur sued that he compelled him to shut himself up in the castle of Ayr, to which he immediately laid siege.1 These repeated successes greatly incensed Edward ; and, although much debilitated by illness, he sum- moned his whole military vassals to meet him at Car- lisle, three weeks after the feast of John the Baptist, and determined to march in person against his ene- mies. Persuading himself that the virulence of his disease was abated, he offered up the litter, in which hitherto he had been carried, in the cathedral at Car- 1 Scala Chronica, p. 132. Math.

But his strength rapidly sunk. In four days he proceeded only six miles ; and after reaching the small village of Burgh-upon-Sands, he expired on the 7th of July, 1307,1 leaving the mighty projects of his ambition, and the uneasy task of opposing Bruce, to a successor whose character was in every way the opposite of his father's. The last request of the dying monarch was characteristic. He commanded that his heart should be conveyed to Jeru salem, and that his body, after having been reduced to a skeleton, by a process which, if we may credit Froissart, the king himself described,2 should be car ried along with the army into Scotland, there to remain unburied till that devoted country was entirely subdued. ' Edward the Second, who succeeded to the crown of England in his twenty-fourth year, was little calcu lated to carry into effect the mighty designs of his predecessor. His character was weak, irresolute, and headstrong ; and the first steps which he took evinced a total want of respect for the dying injunctions of his father. He committed his body to the royal sepulchre at Westminster \u2014 he recalled from banishment Piers Gaveston, his profligate favourite ; and after receiving at Roxburgh the homage of some of the Scottish barons in the interest of England, he pushed forward as far as Cumnock, on the borders of Ayrshire \u2014 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, p. 1018, vol. i. part ii. new edition.

Where this order was disobeyed, the lands were given up to mili tary execution ; aud Bruce, who had not forgotten the defeat and death of his two brothers by the men of this wild district, laid waste the country with fire and sword, and permitted every species of plunder,2 in a spirit of cruel, but, according to the sentiments of that age, not unnatural retaliation. Governed by caprice, and perpetually changing his councils, the King of England removed Pembroke from the guardianship of Scotland, and in his place appointed John de Bretagne earl of Richmond, and nephew of the late king.3 Full power was intrusted to him over all ranks of persons ; the sheriffs of Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire, were commanded to assemble the whole military force of their respective counties, under the orders of the guardian ; the Earl of Dunbar, Robert 1 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 238.

As the soldiers of Bruce were greatly dispirited at the sickness of the king, Edward, his brother, deemed it prudent to avoid a battle, and intrenched himself in a strong position near Slaines, on the east coast of Aberdeenshire. After some slight skirmishes between the archers of both armies, which ended in nothing decisive, provi sions began to fail ; and as the troops of Buchan daily increased, the Scots retired to Strabogy, carrying their king, who was still too weak to mount his horse, in a litter.1 From this last station, as their royal charge began slowly to recover his strength, the Scots returned to Inverury; while the Earl of Buchan, with a body of about a thousand men, advanced to Old Meldrum, and Sir David de Brechin pushed on with a small party, and suddenly attacked and put to flight some of Robert's soldiers, carelessly cantoned in the out skirts of the town.2 Brace took this as a military affront, and instantly rising from his litter, called for his horse and arms. His friends remonstrated ; but the king mounted on horseback, and although so weak as to be supported by two men on each side, led on his soldiers in person, and instantly attacking the Earl of Buchan with great fury,3 routed and dispersed his army, pursuing them as far as Fivy, on the borders of Buchan.

His nephew, Sir David de Brechin, having been pardoned and admitted to favour, joined him about this time with his whole force, and, pursuing his advantage, he laid siege to the castle of Aberdeen.2 Edward was now at Windsor, and, alarmed at such progress, he despatched an expedition to raise the siege of Aberdeen, and commanded the different seaports to fit out a fleet, which should co-operate with his land forces. But these preparations were too late ; for the citizens of Aberdeen, who had early distinguished themselves in the war of liberty, and were warmly attached to the cause, encouraged by the presence of the royal army, and assisted by some of its best leaders, assaulted and carried the castle by storm, expelled the English, and levelled the fortifications with the ground. From Aberdeen the king held his victorious progress into Angus ; and here new success awaited him, in the capture of the castle of Forfar, at this time strongly garrisoned by the English. It was taken by escalade 1 Statistical Account, vol. xi. p. 420. 2 The battle of Inverury was fought on the 22d May, 1308, and Edward's letter for the relief of Aberdeen is dated the 10th July, 1308.

Their ranks were immediately thrown into confusion, twro hundred were left dead on the field, and the rest dispersed amongst the mountains ; while Umfraville, with his companion St John, with difficulty escaped to Butel, a castle on the sea-coast of Galloway.3 After this successful commencement, Edward Bruce overran the country, compelled the inhabitants to swear allegiance to his brother, levied heavy contribu tions, and had already taken and destroyed many of the castles of that wild district, when he received 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. p. 56. 2 It seems probable that Donegal, Dongall, Donald, and Dougal, are all the same name.

Upon his near approach, Bruce discovered, by his scouts, that it was the design of the English to make a forced march, and attack him by surprise. The courage of this brave soldier, bordering on temerity, now impelled him to an attempt which many would have pronounced desperate. He stationed his foot soldiers in a strait valley, strongly fortified by nature,1 and, early in the morning, under the cover of a thick mist, with fifty knights and gentlemen, well armed and mounted, he made a retrograde movement, and gained the rear of the English, without being perceived by them. Fol lowing their line of march about a bow-shot off, his intention seems to have been, to have allowed St John to attack his infantry, and then to have charged them in the rear ; but before this could be effected, the mist suddenly cleared away, and Bruce's little party were discovered when retreat was impossible. In this des perate situation, Edward hesitated not to charge the English, which he did with so much fury, that their ranks were shaken, and many of their cavalry unhorsed. Before they could recover so far as to discern the in significant numbers of their enemy, he made a second, and soon after a third charge, so sharp and well sus tained, that the confusion became general and irre trievable ; and believing, probably, that the Scottish troop was only the advance of a greater force, the English broke away in a panic, and were entirely 1 \" His small folk gait he ilk deil, Withdraw thaim till a strait tharby, And he raid furth with his fifty.\" \u2014 Barbour, p. 183. \" Withdraw thaim till a strait tharby.\" Lord Hailes, and Ker, p. 346, from this expression, conclude that Bruce made his infantry cast up intrenchments.

Sir Alan de Cathcart, one of Edward Brace's companions in this spirited enterprise, recounted the particulars to Barbour, the affectionate biographer of Bruce, who characterizes it in simple but energetic language as a right fair point of chivalry,1 This, however, was not the only success. Donald of the Isles, collecting a large force of his Galwegian infantry, and assisted by Sir Roland of Galloway,2 and other fierce chiefs of that district, made head against the royalists ; but Edward Bruce, flushed with his recent victories, encountered them on the banks of the Dee, dispersed their army, with the slaughter of Roland and many of the chiefs, and in the pursuit took prisoner the Prince of the Isles.3 This defeat, which happened on the 29th of June, 1308, led to the entire expulsion of the English. It is said, that in a single year, this ardent and indefatigable captain besieged and took thirteen castles and inferior strengths in Galloway, and completely reduced the country under the dominion of the king.4 During these repeated victories of his brother, Bruce received intelligence, that his indefatigable partisan, Sir James Douglas, having cut off the garrison of Douglas castle, which he had decoyed into an ambus cade, had slain the governor, Sir John de Webeton, compelled the castle to surrender, and entirely destroy ed the fortifications.5 Douglas soon after reduced to obedience the forests of Selkirk and Jedburgh ; and, 1 Barbour, p. 183. 2 \" Quendam inilitem nomine Rolandum.\" In Rymer, vol. i. new edition, part ii. p. 772, we find mention made of Rolandus Galwalensis Dominus.

Meantime, since thou art so rude of speech, it is fitting thy proud words meet their due punish ment, till thou knowest better my right and thine own duty.\" Having thus spoken, he ordered Randolph into close confinement.2 It is pleasing to know that this lesson had its effect ; for, after a short imprison ment, the young baron joined the party of the king, who created him Earl of Moray. Nor had he any reason to repent his forgiveness or generosity. Ran dolph soon displayed high talents for war ; he became one of the most illustrious of Bruce's assistants in the liberation of his country, and ever after served his royal master with unshaken fidelity. The king had never forgotten the attack made upon him by the Lord of Lorn, soon after the defeat at Methven, and he was now able to requite that fierce chief for the extremities to which he had then reduced Barbour, pp. 187, 188. 5 Ibid, p. 189."], [259, "ROBERT BRUCE. 1308. 253 him. Accordingly, after the junction of Douglas with his veteran soldiers, he invaded the territory of Lorn, and arrived at a narrow and dangerous pass, which runs along the bottom of Cruachin Ben, a high and rugged mountain, between Loch Awe and Loch Etive. The common people of Scotland w7ere now, without much exception, on the side of Bruce ; and although, in many districts, when kept down by their lords, they dared not join him openly, yet in conveying intelli gence of the motions and intentions of his enemies, they were of essential service to the cause. In this manner he seems to have been informed, that an am buscade had been laid for him by the men of Lorn, in the pass of Cruachin Ben, through which he intended to march. The Lord of Lorn himself remained with his galleys, in Loch Etive, and waited the result. The nature of the ground was highly favourable for this design of Lorn ; but it was entirely defeated by the dispositions of Bruce. Having divided his army into two parts, he ordered Douglas, along with one division, consisting entirely of archers, who were lightly armed, to make a circuit round the mountain, and to take possession of the rugged high ground above the Highlanders. Along with Douglas were Sir Andrew Gray, Sir Alexander Fraser, and Sir William Wiseman. This man\u0153uvre was executed with complete success ; and the king having entered the pass, was, in its narrow gorge, immediately at tacked by the men of Lorn, who, with loud shouts, hurled down stones upon him, and after discharging their missiles, rushed on to a nearer attack. But their opponent, whose soldiers were light-armed, and prepared for what occurred, met his enemies more than half-way ; and, not content with receiving their charge, assaulted them with great fury. Meanwhile Douglas"], [260, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1308. 254 had gained the high ground, and discharging a shower of arrows, attacked the Highlanders in the rear, and threw them into complete disorder. After a stout re sistance, the men of Lorn were defeated with great slaughter ; and their chief, the Lord of Lorn, had the mortification, from his galleys, to be an eye-witness of the utter rout of his army.1 He immediately fled to his castle of Dunstaffnage ; and Bruce, after having ravaged the territory of Lorn, and delivered it to indiscriminate plunder, laid close siege to this palace of the island prince, which was strongly situated upon the sea-coast. In a short time the Lord of Lorn surrendered his castle, and swore homage to the king ; but his son, John of Lorn, fled to his ships, and continued in the service of England.2 Whilst every thing went thus successfully in the field, the Scottish king derived great advantage from the fluctuating and capricious line of policy which was pursued by his opponent. In less than a year Edward appointed six different governors in Scotland ; 3 and to none of these persons, however high their talents, was there afforded sufficient time to organize, or carry into effect, any regular plan of military operations. His enemy, on the other hand, betrayed no wrant of activity, and about this time laid siege to Rutherglen, in Clydesdale \u2014 a castle considered of such importance by Edward, that he despatched Gilbert de Clare earl of Gloucester, with a strong force, to raise the siege ; 1 Barbour, pp. 191, 192. 23d August, 1308. 2 Ibid. p. 192.

Alarmed at last by the near approach of the Scottish army to the English border, he consented to accept the mediation of Philip king of France, who despatched Oliver de Roches to treat with Bruce, and Lamberton bishop of St Andrews, upon measures preparatory to a reconciliation. This able and intriguing prelate, on renewing his homage to the English king, had been liberated from his im prisonment, and permitted to return to Scotland ; but his fellow prisoner, Wishart the bishop of Glasgow, considered too devoted to his country, was still kept in close confinement. De Roches' negotiation was soon followed by the arrival of the king's brother, Lewis count of Evreux, and Guy bishop of Soissons, as ambassadors, earnestly persuading to peace ; com missioners from both countries were in consequence appointed, and a truce was concluded, which, if we may believe Edward, was ill observed by the Scots.2 A trifling discovery of an intercepted letter clearly showed that the King of France secretly favoured the Scottish king. The Sieur de Varrennes, Philip's am bassador at the English court, openly sent a letter to Brace under the title of the Earl of Carrick ; but 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, m. 12, p. 60.

Edward dissembled his indignation, and contented himself with a complaint against the duplicity of such conduct.1 Nearly a whole year after this appears to have been spent by this monarch in a vacillating and contradic tory policy with regard to Scotland, which was calcu lated to give every advantage to so able an adversary as Bruce.

To this every thing in Scotland offered a striking contrast. Towards the end of the year 1309, on the 24th February, the prelates and clergy of Scotland held a general council at Dundee, and declared, that Robert lord of Annandale, the competitor, ought, by the ancient laws and customs of that country, to have been preferred to Baliol in the competition for the crown ; for which reason they unanimously recognized Robert Bruce, then reigning, as their lawful sovereign. They engaged to defend his right, with the liberties and independence of Scotland, against all opponents ; 1 Rymer, vol. iii. p. 150.

These solemn transactions gave strength to the title of Bruce, and increased a popularity which was already great. The spirit of the king had infused itself into the nobility, and per- vaded the lowest ranks of the people \u2014 that feeling of superiority, which a great military commander invari- ably communicates (to his soldiers, evinced itself in constant and destructive aggressions upon the English marches ; and upon the recall of the Earl of Hereford and Lord Robert Clifford from the interior of Scot- land, they w7ere necessitated to advance a sum of money before their enemies wrould consent to a truce.2 On the resumption of hostilities, Bruce advanced upon Perth and threatened it with a siege. This town had been strongly fortified by the English, and was intrusted to John Fitz-Marmaduke and a powerful garrison. Edward was at last roused into personal activity. He ordered a fleet to sail to the Tay, he issued writs for levies of troops for its instant relief, 3 and he commanded his whole military vassals to assemble at Berwick on the 8th of September, to proceed immediately against his enemies.

It happened that Scotland was this year visited by a famine unprecedentedly severe ; and the king, after driving away the herds and flocks into the narrow straits and valleys, retired, on the approach of the English, to the woods, and patiently awaited the distress which he knew the scarcity of forage and provisions must entail upon the enemy. The English king marched on from Rox burgh, through the forests of Selkirk and Jedburgh, to Biggar, looking in vain for an opponent. From this he penetrated to Renfrew,2 and, with a weak and injudicious vengeance, burnt and laid waste the coun try, so that the heavy-armed cavalry, which formed the strength of his army, soon began to be in grievous distress; and, without a single occurrence of moment, he was compelled to order a retreat, and return to Berwick, where he spent the winter. Upon the retreat of the English, Bruce and his soldiers, leaving their fastnesses, broke down upon Lothian ; 3 and Edward, hearing of the reappearance of his enemies, with a great part of his forces again entered- Scotland; but this second expedition concluded in the same unsatisfactory manner ; whilst a third army, equally formidable in its numbers and equipment, which was 1 Hemingford, vol. i. p. 247. 2 Ker is in an error in asserting that there is no evidence of Edward's having penetrated to Renfrew.

Edward, in a letter to the pope, complained in bitter terms of the merciless spirit evinced by the Scottish army dur ing this invasion ;4 but we must recollect that this cruel species of warfare was characteristic of the age ; and in Robert, whose personal injuries were so deep and grievous, who had seen the captivity of his queen and only child, and the death and torture of his dearest relatives and friends, we are not to be surprised if, in those dark days, revenge became a pleasure, and reta liation a duty.

It had been intrusted to the command of William Olifant, an Anglicised Scot, to whom Ed ward, in alarm for so important a post, had promised to send speedy succour ;4 but a stratagem of the king's, well planned, and daringly executed, gave Perth into the hands of the Scots before such assistance could arrive. The care of Edward the First had made Perth a place of great strength. It was fortified by a high wall, defended at intervals by stone towers, and sur rounded by a broad deep moat, full of water. Bruce, having carefully observed the place where the fosse was shallowest, provided scaling-ladders, struck his tents, and raised the siege. He then marched to a considerable distance, and having cheated the garrison into security by an absence of eight days, he suddenly returned during the night, and reached the walls un- 1 Edward, in his epistle to the pope, compares them to foxes.

The king in person led his soldiers across the moat, bearing a ladder in his hand, and armed at all points. The water reached his throat, but he felt his way with his spear, waded through in safety, and was the second person who fixed his ladder and mounted the wall. A little inci dent, related by Barbour, evinces the spirit which the example communicated to his companions, and the comparative poverty of the Scottish towns in those times. A French knight was present in the Scottish army, and observing the intrepidity with which Bruce led his soldiers, he exclaimed, \" What shall we say of our French lords, who live at ease, in the midst of feasting, wassail, and jollity, when so brave a knight is here putting his life in hazard to win a miserable hamlet!\"1 So saying, he threw himself into the water with the gay valour of his nation, and having passed the ditch, scaled the walls along with the king and his soldiers. So complete wTas the surprise, that the town was almost instantly taken. Every Scots man who had joined the English interest was put to the sword, but the English garrison were spared ;2 and the king contented himself with the plunder of the place, and the total demolition of its fortifications. In the midst of these continued successes of Bruce, the measures of the English king presented a striking contrast to the energetic administration of his father. They were entirely on the defensive. He gave orders, indeed, for the assembling of an army, and made pro mises and preparations for an invasion of Scotland.

These feeble efforts were followed up by an attempt to conclude a truce ; but the King of Scotland, eager to pursue his career of success, refused to accede 3 to the proposal, and a third time invaded England, with a greater force, and a more desolating fury than before. The towns of Hexham and Corbridge were burnt ; and his army, by a forced march, surprised the opulent city of Durham during the night,4 slew all who resisted him, and reduced a great part of it to ashes. The castle, and the precincts of its noble cathedral, withstood the efforts of the Scots; but the rest of the city was entirely sacked ; and so great was the spoil, that the inhabitants of the bishoprick, dreading the repetition of such a visit, offered two thousand pounds to pur chase a truce.

In the winter of the same year, this monarch was driven to some mean compro mises of his honour. The English garrison of Dundee had been so hard pressed by the Scots, that William de Montfichet, the warden, entered into a treaty to surrender the place, and give up a number of Scottish prisoners, within a stipulated time. Edward was then at York, and, having heard of this agreement, he sent peremptory orders to the warden to violate the truce, and, under the penalty of death to himself, and con fiscation of his estates, to preserve the town by this flagrant act. Montfichet was also enjoined to warn the Scots, that if any of the English prisoners or hos tages should be put to death, orders would be given for the immediate execution of all the Scottish pri soners in the hands of the English. In addition to this, the king addressed flattering letters to the seve ral officers of the garrison of Dundee, and to the mayor, bailiffs, and community, thanking them for their good service, and exhorting them to persevere 1 Fordun a Hearne, vol. iv. p. 1006."], [271, "1312.

He was now commanded to co-operate as joint-warden with Montfichet, and earnest orders were despatched for reinforcements of ships, provisions, and soldiers, to be sent from Newcastle and Berwick.1 The heroic spirit of Bruce had now transfused it self into the peasantry of the country ; and the king began to reap the fruits of this popular spirit, in the capture of the castle of Linlithgow, by a common labourer. His name was Binny ; and being known to the garrison, and employed by them in leading hay into the fort, he communicated his design to a party of Scottish soldiers, whom he stationed in ambush near the gate. In his large wain, he contrived to conceal eight armed men, covered with a load of hay, a servant drove the oxen, and Binny himself walked carelessly at his side. When the portcullis was raised, and the wTain stood in the middle of the gateway, interposing a complete barrier to its descent, the driver cut the ropes which harnessed the oxen ; upon which signal the armed men suddenly leapt from the cart, the soldiers in ambush rushed in, and so com plete was the surprise, that with little resistance the garrison were put to the sword, and the place taken. Bruce amply rewarded the brave countryman, and ordered the castle and its strong outworks, constructed by Edward I., to be immediately demolished.2 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. p. 108. 2d March, 131 1-12. 2 Lord Hailes, following Barbour, p. 196, and Ker, following Lord Hailes, place the capture of Linlithgow in the year 1311.

They at last approached in this way so near, that they could overhear the talk of the sentinels, one of whom observed them moving ; and, deceived by the darkness, remarked to his fellow that yonder oxen were late left out. Relieved by this fortunate mistake, Douglas and his men continued their painful progress, and at length succeeded in reaching the foot of the walls, and fixing their ladders of rope, without being discovered. They could not, bowever, mount so quietly, but that the nearest watch on the outer wall overheard the noise, and ran to meet them.

Already had the Scots spent six weeks in the siege, when an English soldier, of the name of Frank, presented him self to Randolph, and informed him he could point out a place where he had himself often scaled the wall, and by which he undertook to lead his men into the castle. This man, in his youth, when stationed in the castle, had become enamoured of a girl in the neigh bourhood, and for the purpose of meeting her, had discovered a way up and down the perilous cliff, with which custom had rendered him familiar ; and Ran dolph, with thirty determined men, fully armed, placed themselves under his direction, and resolved to scale the castle at midnight.3 The surprise, however, was not nearly so complete as at Roxburgh, aud the affair far more severely contested. Besides, Randolph had only half the number of men with Douglas, the access was far more difficult, and the night was so dark, that the task of climbing the rock became extremely 1 Barbour, pp. 202, 203. 2 Monachi Malmesburiensis Vita Edwardi II., p. 144. 3 Barbour, p. 205."], [274, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1313. 268 dangerous. They persevered, nevertheless, and, on getting about half-way up, found a jutting crag, on which they sat down to take breath. The wall was now immediately above them ; and it happened that the check-watches, at this time, were making their round, and challenging the sentinels, whilst Randolph and his soldiers could hear all that passed. At this critical moment, whether from accident, or that one of the watch had really perceived something moving on the rock, a soldier cast a stone down towards the spot where Randolph sat, and called out, \u2014 \" Away ! I see you well.\" But the Scots lay still, the watch moved on, and Randolph and his men waited till they had gone to some distance. They then got up, and clam bering to the bottom of the wall, at a place where it was only twelve feet in height, fixed the iron crochet of their rope-ladder on the crib-stone.1 Frank was the first who mounted, then followed Sir Andrew Gray, next came Randolph himself, who wras followed by the rest of the party. Before, however, all had got up, the sentinels, who had heard whispering and the clank of arms, attacked them, and shouted \" Trea son!\" They were soon, however, repulsed or slain; and the Scots, by this time on the parapet, leapt down, and rushed on to the keep, or principal strength. The whole garrison was now in arms, and a desperate conflict ensued, in which the English greatly out numbered their assailants. But panic and surprise deprived them of their accustomed bravery; and, al though the governor himself made a gallant defence, he was overpowered and slain, and his garrison imme diately surrendered at discretion.

The castle itself shared the fate of every fortress which fell into the hands of the Scottish king. It was instantly demolished, and rendered incapable of military occu pation. If we consider the small number of men which he led, and the difficult circumstances in which the assault was made, wTe shall probably be inclined to agree with the faithful old historian, who characterizes this exploit of Randolph as one of the hardiest and most chivalrous wrhich distinguished a chivalrous age.1 These great successes so rapidly succeeding each other, and an invasion of Cumberland, which soon after followed, made the English king tremble for the safety of Berwick, and induced him to remove the unfortunate Countess of Buchan from her imprison ment there, to a place of more remote confinement. The conferences for a cessation of hostilities were again renewed, at the request of the French king ; and Edward ostentatiously talked of granting a truce to his enemies in compliance wTith the wishes of Philip,2 which, when it came to the point, his enemies would not grant to him. Soon after this the King of Scotland conducted, in person, a naval expedition against Man. To this island his bitter enemies, the Macdowalls, had retreated, after their expulsion from Galloway, their ancient princi pality; and the then governor of Man appears to have been that same fierce chief, who had surprised Thomas and Alexander Bruce at Loch Ryan. Bruce landed his troops, encountered and routed the governor, 1 Barbour, pp. 207, 212.

After this success, Sir Edward laid siege to the castle of Stirling, nearly the last fortress of importance which now stood between Scotland and freedom. Its governor, Philip de Mowbray, after a long and suc cessful defence, had begun to dread the failure of pro visions in the garrison, and made overtures for a treaty, in which he agreed to surrender the castle by the en suing midsummer, if not relieved by an English army. This was evidently a truce involving conditions which ought on no account to have been accepted. Its necessary effect, if agreed to, was to check the ardour of the Scots in that career of success, which was now rapidly leading to the complete deliverance of their country ; it gave the King of England a whole year to assemble the strength of his dominions ; and such were the chivalrous feelings of that age, as to agree ments of this nature, that it compelled the King of Scotland to hazard the fortunes of his kingdom upon the issue of a battle, which he knew must be fought on his side with a great disparity of force. We need not wonder, then, that Bruce was highly incensed, on hearing that, without consulting him, his brother had agreed to Mowbray's proposals. He disdained, how ever, to imitate the conduct of Edward, who, in a former year, and in circumstances precisely similar, 1 Fordun a Hearne, vol. iv. p. 1007. 11th June, 1313.

He summoned the wThole military force of his kingdoms to meet him at Berwick on the 11th of June.3 To this general muster, ninety-three barons, comprehending the whole body of the great vassals of the crown, were commanded to repair with horse and arms, and their entire feudal service ; whilst the different counties in England and Wales were ordered to raise a body of twenty-seven thousand foot soldiers ; and although Hume, mistaking the evidence of the original record, has imagined that the numbers of this army have been exaggerated by Barbour, it is certain that the accu mulated strength which the king commanded exceeded a hundred thousand men, including a body of forty thousand cavalry, of wThich three thousand were, both horse and man, in complete armour, and a force of fifty thousand archers. He now appointed the Earl of Pembroke, a nobleman experienced, under his father, in the wars of Scotland, to be governor of that country, and despatched him thither to make preparations for his own arrival. He ordered a fleet of twenty-three vessels to be assembled for the invasion of Scotland ;4 in addition to these, he directed letters to the mayor and authorities of the various seaport towns, enjoining 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. p. 108. \u25a0 Barbour, pp. 216, 217. 3 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. iii. pp. 463, 464.

He requested the Bishop of Constance to send him a body of sixty mounted cross-bowmen. He took care that store of provisions for the troops, and forage for the cavalry, should be collected from all quarters ; he placed his victualling department under strict organization ; he appointed John of Argyle, who, probably, had no inconsiderable fleet of his own, to co-operate with the English armament, with the title of high admiral of the western fleet of England;2 and he took care that the army should be provided with all kinds of useful artisans \u2014 smiths, carpenters, masons, armourers \u2014 and supplied with wagons and cars for the transport of the tents, pavilions, aijul baggage, which so large a military array necessarily included. The various writs, and multifarious orders, connected with the summoning and organization of the army of England, which fought at Bannockburn, are still preserved and may be seen in their minutest details ; and they prove that it far exceeded, not only in numbers but in equipment, any army wmich was ever led by any former monarch against Scotland.3 With this great force, Edward prepared to take the 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. p. 115. 12th March, 1313. 2 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, p. 121, m. 7, p. 129. 25th March, 1313-14. 3 Ibid. 7 Ed.

He here found, that the Earls of Warrene, Lancaster, Arundel, and Warwick, refused to attend him in per son, alleging that he had broken his word given to the lord ordinars ; but they sent their feudal services, and the rest of the nobility mustered, without any absentees, and with great splendour : so that the monarch, having reviewed his troops, began his march for Scotland in high spirits, and with confident antici pations of victory. Meanwhile, Bruce, aware of the mighty force which was advancing against him, had not been idle. He appointed a general muster of his whole army in the Torwood, near Stirling,1 and here he found, that the greatest force which could be collected, did not amount to forty thousand fighting men; and that the small body of cavalry which he had, could not be expected to com pete for a moment, either in the temper of their arms, or the strength of their horses, with the heavy cavalry of the English. He at once, therefore, resolved to fight on foot,2 and to draw up his army in ground where cavalry could not act with effect, and where the Eng lish, from their immense numbers, must be cramped and confined in their movements. For this purpose, after a careful examination of the ground, he chose his position with consummate military skill. It was formed on the declivity which runs along the east 1 Barbour, p. 221. 2 The Scala Chron. p. 142, says, that Bruce determined to fight on foot, after the example of the Flemish troops, who a little before this had discomfited the power of France at the battle of Coutray. The same allusion to Coutray is made by the Monk of Malmesbury, p. 152. VOL. I. S"], [280, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1314. 274 side of the marshes of Halbert and Milton. The right of the Scottish line rested on a deep marshy hollow, or syhe, (according to a Scottish term still in use,) which wround round the west and north base of an eminence in the neighbourhood, called the Coxe hill. The left flank rested on the little river Bannock, at the bend which it makes at Milton mill, where its course lies through a deep ravine, wrhich it was im possible for the English army to pass in front of the Scottish host. This rugged ravine, in which the river runs, terminated, however, at the Carse, or level ground, below the village of Bannockburn ; and had this been firm ground, it was practicable for the English force to have crossed the riyer at this spot, turned the left of the Scottish line, traversed the carse, relieved the castle, and terminated the truce. In those days, however, there seems to be no doubt, that this carse was one continued marshy level, im passable by any large body of men, so that this man\u0153uvre was impracticable. The position of Bruce was thus completely covered on both flanks, and sufficiently strong by nature ; but in order to protect it more effectually, he commanded that many parallel rows of pits should be sunk or dug in the firm ground, which extended .from Halbert's marsh to the syke, on which his right rested. These were placed so close to each other, that an ancient con temporary author compares the field or plain thus defended to a honeycomb ; and in these pits, which appear to have been each about a foot in breadth, and three feet in depth, he placed pointed stakes, covering them up carefully with sod, so that the ground, apparently level, was in reality rendered impassable for horse, and dangerous for infantry. The military skill of Bruce was evinced by auother"], [281, "1314. ROBERT BRUCE. 275 precaution. His army had been joined by many wild undisciplined bodies of Highlanders, belonging to the different clans, who wTere accustomed to fight bravely after their own fashion, but little amenable to rule or military order. These, which, along with the suttlers and camp followers, formed a body of twenty thou sand strong, were placed with the baggage in a valley which divided a hill in the neighbourhood, called the Gillie's hill : they were thus completely concealed ; and the position wras so skilfully chosen, that it enabled them, in the event of a successful battle, to co-operate speedily and effectually with the main army, or, should the day go against the Scots, to secure their own retreat, and cover that of the main army. Last of all, Bruce appears to have stationed a small force, or corps of observation, on the Coxe hill, already mentioned, with the design of protecting his rear against any incursions of hostile Highland clans, or any breach of truce upon the part of the governor of Stirling castle. He then formed his reserve imme diately behind the centre ; and having completed these arrangements, fixed the shaft or staff of his royal standard into a large insulated rock or massive stone in front of the reserve ; an interesting relic, which still remains, and is shown upon the spot.1 Having thus judiciously availed himself of every circumstance, the king reviewed his troops, welcomed all courteously, and declared himself well satisfied with their appearance and equipment.

These, with the exception of the last, who was still a youth, were experienced and veteran leaders, who had been long trained up in war, and upon whom their master could place entire reliance ; and having fully explained to them his intended order of battle, the king w7aited in great tranquillity for the approach of the enemy. Soon after, word was brought that the English army had lain all night at Edinburgh. This was on Saturday evening the 22d of June, and early in the morning of Sunday the soldiers heard mass. It is stated by the contemporary historians, that they con fessed themselves with the solemnity of men who were resolved to die in that field, or to free their coun try ; and as it was the vigil of St John, they took no dinner, but kept their fast on bread and water. Mean while the king, on Sunday, after hearing mass, rode out to examine the pits which had been made, and to see that his orders had been duly executed. Having satisfied himself, he returned, and commanded his soldiers to arm. This order was promptly obeyed ; and all cheerfully arrayed themselves under their dif ferent banners. Bruce then caused proclamation to be made, that all who did not feel fully resolved to win the field, or to die with honour, had at that moment free liberty to leave the army ; but the soldiers raised a great shout, and answered with one accord, that they were determined to abide the enemy.1 The king now arranged his army in a line consisting of three square columns, or battles, of which he in- 1 Barbour, pp. 226, 227."], [283, "1314. ROBERT BRUCE. 277 trusted the command of the vaward, or centre, to the Earl of Moray. His brother Edward led the right, the left wTas given to Sir James Douglas, and Walter the Steward of Scotland,1 wdiilst Randolph appears, in the first instance, to have commanded the centre. Bruce himself took the command of the reserve, which formed a fourth battle, drawn up immediately behind the centre, and composed of the men of Argyle, Carrick, Kentire, and the Isles. Along with him wTas Angus of Isla, writh the men of Bute ; and he had also under his command a body of five hundred cavalry, fully armed, and mounted on light and active horses. Having thus disposed his order of battle, the king despatched Sir James Douglas and Sir Robert Keith to reconnoitre, who soon after returned with the news, that they descried the English host advancing in great strength, and making a very martial appearance. For this intelligence Bruce was well prepared ; yet, dread ing its effect upon his soldiers, he directed them to give out to the army, that the enemy, though numerous, were advancing in confused and ill-arranged order.2 Although this was not exactly the case, the rash character of Edward led him to commit some errors in the disposal of his troops, which led to fatal con sequences. He had hurried on to Scotland with such rapidity, that the horses were worn out with travel and want of food, and the men were not allowed the regular periods for halt and refreshment, so that his soldiers wTent into action under great disadvantage. Upon advancing from Falkirk, early in the morning, and when the English host was only two miles distant from the Scottish army, Edward despatched an ad- 1 Barbour, p. 225, 1. 344, compared with L 309. 2 Ibid., p. 229."], [284, "278 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1314. vanced party of eight hundred cavalry, led by Sir Robert Clifford, with orders to outflank the enemy on the left, and to throw themselves into Stirling castle. Bruce had looked for this movement, and had com manded Randolph, his nephew, to be vigilant in repell ing any such attempt.1 Clifford, however, unobserved by Randolph, made a circuit by the low grounds to the east and north of the church of St Ninians, and having thus avoided the front of the Scottish line, he was proceeding towards the castle, when he was de tected by the piercing eye of Bruce, who rode hastily up to Randolph, and reproached him for his careless ness in having suffered the enemy to pass. \" Oh, Randolph ! \" cried his master, \" lightly have you thought of the charge committed to you ; a rose has fallen from your chaplet.\"2 Stung by such words, the Earl of Moray, at the head of a select body of infantry, hasted at all hazards to repair his error. As he advanced, Clifford's squadron wheeled round, and putting their spears in rest, charged him at full speed ; but Randolph had formed his infantry in a square, presenting a front on all sides, with the spears fixed before them ; 3 and although he had only five hundred men, he awaited the shock of Clifford with such firmness, that many of the English were unhorsed and Sir William Daynecourt, an officer of note, who had been more forward in his attack than his com panions, was slain.4 Unable to make any impression upon Randolph's square by this. first attack, the Eng lish proceeded more leisurely to surround him on all sides, and by a second furious and simultaneous charge on each front, endeavoured to break the line. But the light armour, the long spears, and the short knives 1 Barbour, p. 228. 3 Ibid. p. 232. 2 Ibid. p. 231. 4 Ibid. p. 234."], [285, "1314. ROBERT BRUCE. 279 and battle-axes, of the Scottish foot, proved a match for the heavy-armed English cavalry, and a desperate conflict ensued, in which Randolph's little square, al though it stood firm, seemed likely to be crushed to pieces by the heavy metal which was brought against it. All this passed in the sight of Bruce, who was surrounded by his officers. At length Sir James Douglas earnestly requested to be allowed to go with a reinforcement to his relief. \" You shall not stir a foot from your ground,\" said the king, \" and let Ran dolph extricate himself as best he can ; I will not alter my order of battle, and lose my advantage, whatever may befall him.\" \u2014 \" My liege,\" answered Douglas, \" I cannot stand by, and see Randolph perish, when I may bring him help ; so by your leave I must away to his succour.\" Bruce unwillingly consented, and Douglas immediately held his way towards Randolph.1 By this time the King of England had brought up his main army, and ordered a halt, for the purpose of consulting with his leaders, whether it were expedient to join battle that same day, or take a night to re fresh his troops. By some mistake, however, the centre of the English continued its march, not aware of this order, and on their approach, Bruce rode for ward alone to make some new arrangements, which were called for by the absence of Randolph, and to take a final view of the disposition of his army. He was at this time in front of his own line, meanly mounted on a hackney, but clad in full armour, with his battle-axe in his hand, and distinguished from his nobles by a small crown of gold surmounting his steel helmet. On the approach of the English vaward, led by the Earls of Gloucester and Hereford, Sir Henry 1 Barbour, pp. 233, 234."], [286, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1314. 280 de Boune, an English knight, who rode about a bow shot in advance of his companions, recognized the king, and galloped forward to attack him. Boune was armed at all points, and excellently mounted on a heavy war-horse, so that the contest was most un equal, and Bruce might have retired; but for a moment he forgot his duties as a general in his feelings as a knight, and, to the surprise of his soldiers, spurred his little hackney forward to his assailant. There was an interval of breathless suspense, but it lasted only a moment ; for as the English knight came on in full career, the king parried the spear, and, raising himself in his stirrups as he passed, with one blow of his battle axe laid him dead at his feet, by almost cleaving his head in two.1 Upon this his soldiers raised a great shout, and advanced hardily upon the English centre, which retreated in confusion to the main army ; and Bruce, afraid of disorder getting into his line of battle, called back his men from the pursuit, after they had slain a few of the English soldiers. When they had time to recollect themselves, the Scottish leaders earnestly remonstrated with the king for the rash manner in which he exposed himself; and Bruce, somewhat ashamed of the adventure, changed the sub ject, and looking at the broken shaft which he held in his hand, with a smile replied, \" He was sorry for the loss of his good battle-axe.\" 2 All this passed so quickly, that the contest between Randolph and Clifford was still undecided ; but Dou glas, as he drew near to his friend's rescue, perceived that the English had by this time begun to Avaver, and that disorder was rapidly getting into their ranks. Commanding his men, therefore, to halt, \" Let us 1 Barbour, pp. 235, 236. 2 Ibid, p. 237."], [287, "1314. ROBERT BRUCE. 281 not,\" cried he, \" diminish the glory of so redoubtable an encounter, by coming in at the end to share it. The brave men that fight yonder, without our help, will soon discomfit the enemy.\" And the result was as Douglas had foreseen ; for Randolph, who quickly perceived the same indications, began to press the English cavalry with repeated charges and increasing fury, so that they at length entirely broke, and fled in great disorder. The attempt to throw succours into the castle was thus completely defeated ; and Clifford, after losing many of his men, who were slain in the pursuit, rejoined the main body of the army with the scattered and dispirited remains of his squadron.1 So steadily had the Scots kept their ranks, that Randolph had sustained a very inconsiderable loss. From the result of these two attacks, and especially from the defeat of Clifford, Bruce drew a good augury, and cheerfully congratulated his soldiers on so fair a beginning. He observed to them, that they had defeated the flower of the English cavalry, and had driven back the centre division of their great army ; and remarked, that the same circumstances which gave spirit and animation to their hopes, must com municate depression to the enemy.2 As the day was far spent, he held a military council of his leaders, and requested their advice, whether, having now seen the numbers and strength of their opponents, it was expedient to hazard a battle, declaring himself ready to submit his individual opinion to the judgment of the majority. But the minds of the Scottish com manders were not in a retreating mood ; and although aware of the great disparity of force, the English army being more than triple that of Bruce, they de- 1 Barbour, pp. 238, 239. 2 Ibid., pp. 240,241."], [288, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1314. 282 clared their unanimous desire to keep their position, and to fight on the morrow. The king then told them that such was his own wish, and commanded them to have the whole army arrayed next morning by day break, in the order and upon the ground already agreed on. He earnestly exhorted them to preserve the firmest order, each man under his own banner, and to receive the charge of the enemy with levelled spears, so that even the hindmost ranks of the English would feel the shock. He pointed out to them, that every thing in the approaching battle, which was to determine whether Scotland wTas to be free or enslaved, depended on their own steady discipline and delibe rate valour. He conjured them not to allow a single soldier to quit his banner or break the array ; and, if they should be successful, by no means to begin to plunder or to make prisoners, as long as a single enemy remained on the field. He promised that the heirs of all who fell should receive their lands free, and without the accustomed feudal fine ; and he assured them, with a determined and cheerful counte nance, that if the orders he had now given were obeyed, they might confidently look forward to vic tory.1 Having thus spoken to his leaders, the army were dismissed to their quarters. In the evening, they made the necessary arrangements for the battle, and passed the night in arms upon the field. Meanwhile, the English king and his leaders had resolved, on account of tne fatigue undergone by the troops, and symptoms of dissatisfaction which appeared amongst them, to delay the attack, and drew off to the low grounds to the right and rear of their original posi- 1 Barbour, pp. 243, 244."], [289, "1314. ROBERT BRUCE. 283 tion, where they passed the night in riot and disorder.1 At this time, it is said, a Scotsman, who served in the English army, deserted to Bruce, and informed him he could lead him to the attack so as to secure an easy victory. Robert, however, was not thus to be drawn from his position, and determined to await the enemy on the ground already chosen. On Monday, the 24th of June, at the first break of day, the Scottish king confessed, and, along with his army, heard mass. This solemn service was per formed by Maurice, the Abbot of Inchaffray, upon an eminence in front of their line ; and after its conclu sion the soldiers took breakfast, and arranged them selves under their different banners. They wore light armour, but of excellent temper. Their weapons were, a battle-axe, slung at their side, and long spears, besides knives, or daggers, which the former affair of Randolph had proved to be highly effective in close combat. When the whole army was in array, they proceeded, with displayed banners, to make knights, as was the custom before a battle. Bruce conferred that honour upon Walter the young Steward of Scot land, Sir James Douglas, and many other brave men, in due order, and according to their rank.2 By this time, the van of the English army, com posed of archers and lances, and led by the Earls of Gloucester and Hereford, approached within bowshot ; and at a little distance behind, the remaining nine divisions, which, confined by the narrowness of the ground, were compressed into a close column of great and unwieldy dimensions.3 This vast body was con ducted by the King of England in person, who had along with him a body-guard of five hundred chosen 1 Thomas de la More, apud Camden, p. 594. 2 Barbour, p. 248. 3 Walsingham, p. 105."], [290, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1314. 284 horse. He was attended by the Earl of Pembroke, Sir Ingram Umfraville, and Sir Giles de Argentine, a knight of Rhodes, of great reputation.1 When Ed ward approached near enough, and observed the Scot tish army drawn up on foot, and their firm array and determined countenance, he expressed much surprise, and, turning to Umfraville, asked him, \" If he thought these Scots would fight ? \" Umfraville replied, that they assuredly would ; and he then advised Edward, instead of an open attack, to pretend to retreat behind his encampment, upon which he was confident, from his old experience in the Scottish wars, that the enemy would break their array, and rash on without order or discipline, so that the English army might easily attack and overwhelm them. Umfraville, an Angli cised Scottish baron, who had seen much service against Edward's father, and had only sworn fealty in 1305, spoke this from an intimate knowledge of his countrymen ; but Edward fortunately disdained his counsel. At this moment the Abbot of Inchaffray, barefooted and holding a crucifix aloft in his hand, walked slowly along the Scottish line ; and as he passed, the whole army knelt down,2 and prayed for a moment with the solemnity of men who felt it might be their last act of devotion. \" See,\" cried Edward, \" they are kneeling ; they ask mercy ! \" \u2014 \" They do, my liege,\" replied Umfraville, \" but it is from God, not from us. Trust me, yon men will win the day, or die upon the field.\"3 \u2014 \" Be it so, then,\" said Edward, and immediately commanOed the charge to be sounded.

ROBERT BRUCE. 285 at full gallop charged the right wing of the Scots, commanded by Edward Bruce ; but a dispute between the two English barons as to precedency, caused the charge, though rapid, to be broken and irregular. Gloucester, who had been irritated the day before by some galling remarks of the king, insisted on leading the van, a post wThich of right belonged to Hereford, as Constable of England. To this Hereford would not agree ; and Gloucester, as they disputed, seeing the Scottish right advancing, sprung forward at the head of his own division, and, without being supported by the rest of the van, attacked the enemy, who received them with a shock which caused the noise of the meeting of their spears to be heard a great way off, and threw many knights from their saddles, whose horses were stabbed and rendered furious by their wounds.1 While the right wing was thus engaged, Randolph, who com manded the centre division, advanced at a steady pace to meet the main body of the English, whom he con fronted and attacked with great intrepidity, although the enemy outnumbered him by ten to one. His square, to use an expression of Barbour, was soon surrounded and lost amidst the English, as if it had plunged into the sea ; upon which Sir James Douglas and Walter the Steward brought up the left wing ; so that the whole line, composed of the three battles, was now engaged, and the battle raged with great fury.2 The English cavalry attempting, by repeated charges, to break the line of the Scottish spearmen, and they standing firm in their array, and presenting on every side a serried front of steel, caused a shock and melee, which is not easily described ; and the slaughter was increased, by the remembrance of many years of griev- 2 Ibid. pp. 252, 253. 1 Barbour, p. 251."], [294, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1314. 286 ous injury and oppression, producing, on the part of the Scots, an exasperation of feeling, and an eager desire of revenge. At every successive charge, the English cavalry lost more men, and fell into greater confusion than before ; and this confusion was infinitely increased by the confined nature of the ground, and the immense mass of their army. The Scottish squares, on the other hand, were light and compact, though firm ; they moved easily, altered their front at pleasure, and suited themselves to every emergency of the battle. They were, however, dreadfully galled by the English bowmen ; and Brace, dreading the effect of the con stant and deadly showers of arrows, which fell like hail upon them, directed Sir Robert Keith, the mar shall, to make a circuit, with the five hundred horse which were in the reserve, round the morass called Milton Bog, and to charge the archers in flank. This movement was executed with great decision and rapi dity ; and such was its effect, that the whole body of the archers, who had neither spears nor other weapons to defend themselves against cavalry, were in a short time overthrown and dispersed, without any prolonged attempt at resistance.1 Part of them fled to the main army, and the rest did not again attempt to rally or make head during the continuance of the battle. Although such was the success of this judicious attack, the English still kept fighting with great determina tion ; but they had already lost some of their bravest commanders, and Bruce could discern symptoms of exhaustion and impatience. He saw, too, that his own infantry were still fresh and well-breathed; and he assured his leaders that the attack, continued but for a short time, and pushed with vigour, must make the 1 Barbour, pp. 255, 256."], [295, "1314. ROBERT BRUCE. 287 day their own. It was at this moment that he brought up his whole reserve, and the four battles of the Scots were now completely engaged in one line.1 The Scot tish archers, unlike the English, carried short battle axes ; and with these, after they had exhausted their arrows, they rushed upon the enemy, and made great havock. The Scottish commanders, too, the king, Edward Bruce, Douglas, Randolph, and the Steward, wTere fighting in the near presence of each other, and animated with a generous rivalry. At this time, Bar bour, whose account of the battle is evidently taken from eye-witnesses, describes the field as exhibiting a terrific spectacle. \" It was awful,\" says he, \" to hear the noise of these four battles fighting in a line, the clang of arms, the shouts of the knights as they raised their war-cry ; to see the flight of the arrow's, which maddened the horses, the alternate sinking and rising of the banners, and the ground slippery wTith gore, and covered with shreds of armour, broken spears, pennons, and rich scarfs, torn and soiled with blood and clay ; and to listen to the groans of the wounded and the dying.\" The wavering of the English lines was now discernible by the Scottish soldiers themselves, who shouted when they saw it, and calling out, \"On them, on them \u2014 they fail ! \" pressed forward with renewed vigour, gaining ground upon their enemy.2 At this critical moment, there appeared over the shoulder of the Gillie's hill, already described, a large body of troops marching with displayed banners, and apparently in firm array, towards the field. It was the mixed multitude of the highland clans and camp-followers, who, according to Bruce's orders, had seized this moment to advance ; and the spectacle, which was 1 Barbour, p. 258. Chron. of Lanercost, p. 225. 2 Barbour, p. 259."], [296, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1314. 288 instantly believed to be a reinforcement proceeding to join the Scots, spread dismay amidst the ranks of the English ; and King Robert, whose eye was everywhere, to perceive and take advantage of the slightest move ment in his favour, put himself at the head of his reserve, and raising his ensenye, or war-cry, furiously pressed on the enemy.1 It was this last charge, which was followed up by the advance of the whole line, that decided the day ; the English, who hitherto, although wavering, had preserved their array, now broke into disjointed squadrons ; part began to quit the field, and no efforts of their leaders could restore order. The Earl of Gloucester, who was mounted on a spirited war-horse, which had lately been presented to him by the king,2 in one of his attempts to rally his men, rode desperately upon the division of Edward Bruce ; he was instantly unhorsed, and fell pierced by numerous wounds of the Scottish lances. The flight now became general, and the slaughter great. The banners of twenty-seven barons were laid in the dust, and their masters slain. Amongst these were Sir Robert Clif ford, a veteran and experienced commander, and Sir Edmund Mauley, the Seneschal of England. On see ing the entire rout of his army, Edward reluctantly allowed the Earl of Pembroke to seize his bridle, and force him off the field, guarded by five hundred heavy armed horse. Sir Giles de Argentine accompanied him a short way, till he saw the king in safety. He then reined up, and bade him farewell. \" It has never been my custom,\" said he, \" to fly ; and here I must take my fortune.\" Saying this, he put spurs to his 1 Barbour, p. 261. 2 Hutchinson's Hist, and Antiquities of the Palatinate of Durham, p. 261. \" The Bishop of Durham, Richard Kellow, had a short time before presented this war-horse, an animal of high price, along with one thousand marks, to King Edward.\""], [297, "1314. ROBERT BRUCE. 289 horse, and crying out, \" An Argentine!\" charged the squadron of Edward Bruce, and, like Gloucester, was soon borne down by the force of the Scottish spears, and cut to pieces.1 Multitudes of the English were drowned wrheu attempting to cross the river Forth. Many, in their flight, got entangled in the pits, which they seem to have avoided in their first attack, and were there suffocated or slain ; others, who vainly endeavoured to pass the rugged banks of the Bannock burn, were slain in that quarter ; so completely was this little river heaped up with the dead bodies of men and horse, that the pursuers passed dry over the mass as if it wrere a bridge. Thirty thousand of the Eng lish wTere left dead upon the field, and amongst these two hundred knights and seven hundred esquires. A large body of Welsh fled, under the command of Sir Maurice Berkclay, but the greater part of them were slain, or taken prisoners, before they reached England.2 Such also might have been the fate of the King of England himself, had Bruce been able to spare a suffi cient body of cavalry to follow up the chase. But when Edward left the field, with his five hundred horse, many straggling parties of the enemy still lin gered about the lowT grounds, aud numbers had taken refuge under the walls, and in the hollow recesses of the rock on which Stirling castle is built.3 These, had they rallied, might have still created much annoy ance, a part of the Scottish army being occupied in plundering the camp ; aud it thus became absolutely necessary for Bruce to keep the more efficient part of his troops together. When Douglas, therefore, pro posed to pursue the king, he could obtain no more 1 Barbour, p. 263. 3 Ibid. pp. 266, 267. VOL. I. 3 Ibid. X"], [298, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 290 1314. than sixty horsemen. In passing the Torwood, he was met by Sir Laurence Abernethy, hastening with a small body of cavalry to join the English. This knight immediately deserted a falling cause, and assisted in the chase. They made up to the fugitive monarch at Lithgow ; but Douglas deemed it impru dent to hazard an attack with so inferior a force. He pressed so hard upon him, however, as not to suffer the English to have a moment's rest ; and it is a strong proof of the panic which had seized them, that a body of five hundred heavy horse, armed to the teeth, fled before eighty Scottish cavalry, without attempting to make a stand. But it is probable they believed Dou glas to be the advance of the army.1 Edward at last gained the castle of Dunbar, where he was hospitably received by the Earl of March, and from which he passed by sea to Berwick. In the meantime, Bruce sent a party to attack the fugitives who clustered round the rock of Stirling. These were immediately made prisoners ; and having ascertained that no enemy re mained, the king permitted his soldiers to pursue the fugitives, and give themselves up to plunder. The unfortunate stragglers were slaughtered by the pea santry, as they were dispersed over the country ; and many of them, casting away their arms and accoutre ments, hid themselves in the woods, or fled almost naked from the field.2 Some idea of the extent and variety of the booty which was divided by the Scottish soldiers, may be formed from the circumstance men tioned by an English historian, \" That the chariots, wagons, and wheeled carriages, which were loaded with the baggage and military stores, would, if drawn up in a line, have extended for twenty leagues.\"3 1 Henry Knighton, p. 2533.

Besides all this, Edward had brought along with him many instruments of war, and machines employed in the besieging of towns, such as petronels, trebuchets, man gonels, and battering rams, which, intended for the demolition of the Scottish castles, now fell into the hands of Bruce, to be turned, in future wars, against England. The living booty, too, in the many prison ers of rank wrho were taken, was great. Twenty-two barons and bannerets, and sixty knights, fell into the hands of the Scots. Considering the grievous injuries which he had personally sustained, the King of Scot land evinced a generous forbearance in the uses of his victory, which does him high honour : not only was there no unnecessary slaughter, no uncalled-for severity of retaliation, but, in their place, we find a high-toned courtesy, which has called forth the praises of his enemies.1 The body of the young and noble Earl of Gloucester was reverently carried to a neighbouring church, and every holy rite duly observed. It was afterwards sent to England, along with the last remains of the brave Lord Clifford, to be interred with 1 Joh. de Trokelowe, p. 28."], [300, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1314. 292 the honours due to their rank. The rest of the slain were reverently buried upon the field.1 Early next morning, as the king examined the ground, Sir Mar maduke de Twenge, who had lurked all night in the woods, presented himself to Bruce, and, kneeling down, delivered himself as his prisoner. Bruce kindly raised him, retained him in his company for some time, and then dismissed him, not only without ransom, but enriched with presents.2 It happened that one Baston, a Carmelite friar, and esteemed an excellent poet, had been commanded by Edward to accompany the army, that he might immor talize the expected triumph of his master. He was taken ; and Bruce commanded him, as an appropriate ransom, to celebrate the victory of the Scots at Ban nockburn, \u2014 a task wThich he has accomplished in a composition which still remains an extraordinary relic of the Leonine, or rhyming hexameters.3 On the day after the battle, Mowbray, the English governor of Stirling, having delivered up that fortress, according to the terms of the truce, entered into the service of the King of Scotland ; and the Earl of Hereford, who had taken refuge in Bothwell castle, then in the hands of the English, capitulated, after a short siege, to Edward Bruce. This nobleman was exchanged for five illustrious prisoners, Bruce's wife, his sister Christian, his daughter Marjory, Wishart the Bishop of Glasgow, now blind, and the young Earl of Mar, nephew to the king. John de Segrave, made prisoner at Bannockburn, was ransomed for five Scot tish barons ; so that, in these exchanges, the English appear to have received nothing like an adequate value. The riches obtained by the plunder of the 1 Barbour, p. 273. ' Fordun a Goodal, p. 251. 2 Ibid. p. 269."], [301, "1314. ROBERT BRUCE. 293 English, and the subsequent ransom paid for the multitude of prisoners, must have been great. The exact amount cannot be easily estimated, but some idea of it may be formed from the tone of deep lamen tation assumed by the Monk of Malmesbury. \" 0 day of vengeance and of misfortune!\" says he; \"day of disgrace and perdition ! unworthy to be included in the circle of the year, which tarnished the fame of England, and enriched the Scots with the plunder of the precious stuffs of our nation, to the extent of two hundred thousand pounds. Alas ! of how many noble barons, and accomplished knights, and high-spirited young soldiers, \u2014 of what a store of excellent arms, and golden vessels, and costly vestments, did one short and miserable day deprive us!\"1 Two hundred thousand pounds of money in those times, amounts to about six hundred thousand pounds weight of silver, or nearly three millions of our present money. It is remarkable that Sir William Vipont, and Sir Walter Ross, the bosom friend of Edward Bruce, were the only persons of note who were slain on the side of the Scots, whose loss, even in common men, was small ; proving how effectually their squares had repelled the English cavalry. Such was the great battle of Bannockburn, interest ing above all others which have been fought between the then rival nations, if we consider the issue which hung upon it ; and glorious to Scotland, both in the determined courage wTith which it was disputed by the troops, the high military talents displayed by the king and his leaders, and the amazing disparity between the numbers of the combatants. Its consequences were in 1 Monachi Malmesburiensis, p. 152."], [302, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 294 1314. the highest degree important. It put an end for ever to all rational hope upon the part of England of ac complishing the conquest of her sister country. The plan, of which we can discern the foundations as far back as the reign of Alexander III., and for the furtherance of which the first Edward was content to throw away so much of treasure and blood, was put down in the way in which all such schemes ought to be defeated \u2014 by the strong hand of free-born men, who were determined to remain so ; and the spirit of indignant resistance to foreign power, which had been awakened by Wallace, but crushed for a season by the dissensions of a jealous nobility, was concentrated by the master-spirit of Bruce, and found fully adequate to overwhelm the united military energies of a king dom, far superior to Scotland in all that constituted military strength. Nor have the consequences of this victory been partial or confined. Their duration throughout succeeding centuries of Scottish history and Scottish liberty, down to the hour in which this is written, cannot be questioned ; and without launching out into any inappropriate field of historical specu lation, we have only to think of the most obvious consequences which must have resulted from Scotland becoming a conquered province of England ; and if we wish for proof, to fix our eyes on the present condition of Ireland, in order to feel the reality of all that we owe to the victory at Bannockburn, and to the memory of such men as Brace, Randolph, and Douglas."], [303, "ROBERT BRUCE. 1314. 295 CHAP.

A deep and general panic seized the English after the disastrous defeat at Bannockburn. The weak and undecided character of the king infected his nobility ; and the common soldiers, having lost all confidence in their officers, became feeble and dispirited themselves. \" A hundred English would not hesitate,\" says Wal singham, \" to fly from two or three Scottish soldiers, so grievously had their wonted courage deserted them.\"1 Taking advantage of this dejection, the king, in the beginning of autumn,2 sent Douglas and Edward Bruce across the eastern marches, with an army which wasted Northumberland, and carried fire and sword through the principality of Durham, where they levied severe contributions. They next pushed forward into Yorkshire, and plundered Richmond, driving away a large body of cattle, and making many prisoners. On their way homeward, they burnt Appleby 1 Walsingham, p. 106. 2 It was before the 10th of August.

Edward immediately confirmed this nomination, and, for the pressing nature of the emergency, the measure was not impolitic ; but these border troops soon forgot their allegiance, and, upon the failure of their regular supplies from the king's exchequer, became little better than the Scots themselves, plundering the country, and subsisting themselves by every species of theft, robbery, and murder.1 Robert wisely seized this period of distress and na tional dejection, to make pacific overtures to Edward, and to assure him that, having secured the indepen dence of his kingdom, there was nothing which he more anxiously desired, than a firm and lasting peace between the two nations. Negotiations soon after followed. Four Scottish ambassadors met with the commissioners of England, and various attempts wrere made for the establishment of a perpetual peace, or at least of a temporary truce between the rival countries ; but these entirely failed, owing, probably, to the high tone assumed by the Scottish envoys ; and the termi nation of this destructive war appeared still more dis tant than before.2 Towards the end of this year, the 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. p. 137, 10th January, 1314.

Small squadrons of ships were employed to cruise round the island, so as to intercept all foreign supplies; and letters were directed to the Earl of Flanders, and to the Counts of Holland, Lunenburgh, and Brabant, requesting them to put a stop to all commercial intercourse between their dominions and Scotland \u2014 a request with which these sagacious and wealthy little states peremptorily refused to comply.1 In the spring, another Scottish army broke in upon Northumberland, again ravaged the principality of Durham, sacked the seaport of Hartlepool, and, after collecting their plunder, compelled the inhabitants to redeem their property and their freedom by a high tribute. Carrying their arms to the gates of York, they wasted the country with fire and swTord, and re duced the wretched English to the lowest extremity of poverty and despair.2 Carlisle, Newcastle, and Berwick, defended by strong fortifications, and well garrisoned, were now the only cities of refuge where there was security for property ; and to these towns the peasantry flocked for protection, whilst the barons and nobility, instead of assembling their vassals to repel the common enemy, spent their time in idleness and jollity in the capital.3 An important measure, relating to the succession of the crown, now occupied the attention of the estates of Scotland, in a parliament held at Ayr, on the 26th of April.

It was moreover provided, with consent of the king, and of his brother Edward, that, failing Edward and his heirs male, Marjory should immediately succeed ; and fail ing her, the nearest heir lineally descended of the body of King Robert ; but under the express condition, that Marjory should not marry without the consent of her father, and failing him, of the majority of the estates of Scotland. If it happened, that either the king, or his brother Edward, or Marjory his daughter, should die, leaving an heir male, who was a minor, in that event Thomas Randolph earl of Moray was constituted guardian of the heir, and of the kingdom, till the estates considered the heir of a fit age to administer the go vernment in his own person ; and in the event of the death of Marjory without children, the same noble person was appointed to this office, if he chose to accept the burden, until the estates and community, in their wisdom, determine the rightful succession to the crown.1 Not long after this, the king bestowed his daughter Marjory in marriage upon Walter the hereditary High steward of Scotland ; an important union, which gave heirs to the Scottish crown, and afterwards to the throne of the united kingdoms.2 An extraordinary episode in the history of the king dom now claims our attention. Edward Bruce, the king's brother, a man of restless ambition and un daunted enterprise, fixed his eyes upon Ireland, at this 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. pp. 256, 258.

He was accompanied by the Earl of Moray, Sir Philip Mowbray, Sir John Soulis, Sir Fergus of Ardrossan, and Ramsay of Ochterhouse. In a series of battles, which it would be foreign to the object of this history to enumerate, although they bear testimony to the excellent discipline of the Scot tish knights and soldiers, Edward Bruce overran the provinces of Down, Armagh, Louth, Meath, and Kildare ; but was compelled by want, and the reduced numbers of his little army, to retreat into Ulster, and despatch the Earl of Moray for new succours into Scotland. He was soon after crowned King of Ire land, and immediately after his assumption of the regal dignity, laid siege to Carrickfergus. On being informed of the situation of his brother's affairs, King Robert intrusted the government of the kingdom to his son-in-law the Steward, and Sir James Douglas. 1 Barbour, p. 277. 2 Neither Lord Hailes, nor any other Scottish historian, take notice of the ambitious and factious character of Edward Bruce, although Fordun expressly says : \u2014 \" Iste Edwardus erat homo ferox, et magni cordis valde, nee voluit cohabitare fratri suo in pace, nisi dimidium regni solus-haberet ; et hac de causa mota suit guerra in Hibernia, ubi ut pr\u00e6mittitur finivit vitam.\" Fordun a Hearne, p. 1009."], [310, "302 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1315. He then passed over to the assistance of the new king with a considerable body of troops ; and, after their junction, the united armies, having reduced Carrick fergus, pushed forward through the county Louth, to Slane, and invested Dublin ; but being compelled to raise the siege, they advanced into Kilkenny, wasted the country as far as Limerick, and, after experiencing the extremities of famine, and defeating the enemy wherever they made head against them, terminated a glorious but fruitless expedition, by a retreat into the province of Ulster, in the spring of 1317. 1 The King of Scotland now returned to his domi nions, taking along with him the Earl of Moray, but having left the flower of his army to support his bro ther in the possession of Ulster. A miserable fate awaited these brave men. After a long period of inaction, in which neither the Irish annals nor our early Scottish historians afford any certain light, we find King Edward Bruce encamped at Tagher, near Dundalk, at the head of a force of two thousand men, exclusive of the native Irish, who were numerous, but badly armed and disciplined. Against him, Lord John Bermingham, along with John Maupas, Sir Miles Verdon, Sir Hugh Tripton, and other Anglo- Irish barons, led an army which was strong in cavalry, and outnumbered the Scots by nearly ten to one. Edward, with his characteristic contempt of danger, and nothing daunted by the disparity of force, deter mined, against the advice of his oldest captains, to give the enemy battle. In the course of a three years' war, he had already engaged the Anglo-Irish forces eighteen times ; and, although his success had led to no important result, he had been uniformly victorious.2 1 Fordun a Hearne, p. 1008. 2 I have here followed the authority of Barbour, p. 317."], [311, "1315. ROBERT BRUCE. 303 But his fiery career was now destined to be quenched, and his short-lived sovereignty to have an end. On the 5th of October, 1318, the two armies joined battle, and the Scots we're almost immediately dis comfited.1\" At the first onset, John Maupas slew King Edward Bruce, and was himself found slain, and stretched upon the body of his enemy. Sir John Soulis and Sir John Stewart also fell ; and the rout becoming general, the slaughter was great. A mise rable remnant, however, escaping from the field, under John Thomson, the leader of the men of Carriek, made good their retreat to Carrickfergus, and from thence reached Scotland. Two thousand Scottish soldiers were left dead upon the spot, and amongst these some of Bruce's best captains.2 Thus ended an expedition which, if conducted by a spirit of more judicious and deliberate valour than distinguished its prime mover, might have produced the most serious annoyance to England. Unmindful of the generous courtesy of Bruce's behaviour after the battle of Ban nockburn, the English treated the body of the King of Ireland with studied indignity. It was quartered and distributed as a public spectacle over Ireland, and the head wTas presented to the English king by Lord John Bermingham, who, as a rewar*d for his victory, was created Earl of Louth.3 Having given a continuous sketch of this disastrous enterprise, which, from its commencement till the death of Edward, occupied a period of three years, we shall return to the affairs of Scotland, where the wise administration of King Robert brought security and happiness to the people both at home and in their foreign relations. 1 Barbour, p. 364. 2 Their names will be found in Trivet, contin. p. 29. 3 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. iii. p. 767."], [312, "304 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1315. The ships which had transported Edward Bruce and his army to Ireland, were immediately sent home ; and the king undertook an expedition against the Western Isles, some of which had acknowledged his dominion ;x whilst others, under John of Argyle, the firm ally of England, had continued for a long time to harass and annoy the commerce of his kingdom. Although constantly occupied in a land war, during the course of which he had brought his army into a high state of discipline, Bruce had never been blind to the strength which he must acquire by having a fleet which could cope with the maritime power of his rival ; and from the complaints of the English mon arch in the state papers of the times, we know that on both sides of the island, the Scottish vessels, and those of their allies, kept the English coast towns in a state of constant alarm.2 Their fleets seem to have been partly composed of privateers, as well Flemish as Scottish, which, under the protection of the king, roved about, and attacked the English merchantmen. Thus, during Edward Bruce's expedition, he met, when on the Irish coast, and surrounded with difficulties, with Thomas of Doune, a Scottish \" scoumar,\" or freebooter, \" of the se,\" 3 who, with a small squadron of four ships, sailed up the river Ban, and extricated his countrymen from their perilous situation. In his expedition to the Isles, Bruce was accompa nied by his son-in-law, the Steward of Scotland ; and having sailed up the entrance of Loch Fine to Tarbet, 1 F\u0153dera, vol. iii. p. 238. 2 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. p. 151, date 6th November, 1315. 3 Barbour, book x. p. 288.

ROBERT BRUCE. 305 he dragged his vessels upon a slide, composed of smooth planks of trees, laid parallel to each other, across the narrow neck of land which separates the lochs of East and West Tarbet. The distance was little more than an English mile ; and by this expedient Bruce not only saved the necessity of doubling the Mull of Ken tire, (to the small craft of those days often a fatal enterprise,) but availed himself of a superstitious belief then current amongst the western islanders, that they should never be subdued till their invader sailed across the isthmus of Tarbet.1 The presence of the king in the Western Isles was soon followed by the submis sion of all the little pirate chiefs who had given him disturbance, and by the capture and imprisonment of John of Lorn, who, since his defeat at Cruachin Ben, had been constantly in the pay of Edward, with the proud title of Admiral of the Western fleet of Eng land.2 This island prince was first committed to Dunbarton castle, and afterwards shut up in the castle of Lochleven, where he died.3 After the termination of his peaceful maritime campaign, the king indulged himself and his friends in the diversion of the chase ; whilst, at home, his army, under Douglas, continued to insult and plunder the English border counties.4 On his return from the Western Isles, Bruce under took the siege of Carlisle ; but, after having assaulted it for ten days, he was compelled, by the strength of the works, and the spirit of its towmsmen and garrison, 1 Barbour, p. 302.

Berwick, too, was threatened from the side next the sea by the Scottish ships, which attempted to steal up the river unperceived by the enemy, but were discovered, and bravely repulsed.1 Against these reiterated insults, Edward, unable from his extreme unpopularity to raise an army, contented himself with querulous complaints, and with some in effectual advances towards a reconciliation,2 which as yet was far distant. About this time, to the great joy of the King of Scotland and of the nation, the Princess Marjory bore a son, Robert, who wTas destined, after the death of David, his uncle, to succeed to the throne, and become the first of the royal house of Stewart; but grief soon followed joy, for the young mother died almost immediately after child-birth.3 Undaunted by the partial check which they had received before Carlisle and Berwick, the activity of the Scots gave the English perpetual employment. On one side they attacked Wales, apparently making descents from their ships upon the coast ; and Edward, trembling for the security of his new principality, countermanded the Welsh levies which were about to join his army, and enjoined them to remain at home ; but he accompanied this with an order to give hostages for their fidelity, naturally dreading the effect of the example of the Scots, upon a nation wrhose fetters were yet new and galling.4 On the other side, 1 Chron.

ROBERT BRUCE. 307 King Robert in person led his army, about midsum mer, into Yorkshire, and wasted the country, without meeting an enemy, as far as Richmond. A timely tribute, collected by the neighbouring barons and gentlemen, saved this town from the flames; but this merely altered the order of march into the West Riding, which was cruelly sacked aud spoiled for sixty miles round, after which the army returned with their booty and many prisoners.1 Bruce then embarked for Ireland ; and soon after the English king, encouraged by his absence and that of Randolph, summoned his military vassals to meet him at Newcastle, and deter mined to invade Scotland with great strength ; but the Earl of Lancaster, to whom the conduct of the enterprise was intrusted, and the barons of his party, having in vain waited at Newcastle for the king's arrival, returned home in displeasure ;2 so that the original design of Edward broke down into several smaller invasions, in repelling which, the activity and military enterprise of Sir James Douglas and the Steward, not only kept up, but materially increased, the Scottish ascendency. In Douglas, the adventurous spirit of chivalry w^as finely united with the character of an experienced commander. At this time he held his quarters at Linthaughlee, near Jedburgh ; and having information that the Earl of Arundel, with Sir Thomas de Richemont, and an English force of ten thousand men, had crossed the borders, he determined to attack him in a narrow pass, through which his line of march lay, and which was flanked on each side by a wood. Having thickly twisted together the young birch trees on either side, so as to prevent escape,3 he concealed his archers in a hollow way near the gorge 2 Tyrrel, vol. iii. p. 267. 1 Chron. Lanercost, p. 233. 3 Barbour, p. 324."], [316, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1316-17. 308 of the pass, and when the English ranks were com pressed by the narrowness of the road, and it was impossible for their cavalry to act with effect, he rushed upon them at the head of his horsemen, whilst the archers, suddenly discovering themselves, poured in a flight of arrows, so that the unwieldy mass was thrown into confusion, and took to flight. In the melee, Douglas slew Thomas de Richemont with his dagger ; and although, from his inferiority of force, he did not venture to pursue the enemy into the open country, yet they were compelled to retreat with great slaughter.1 Soon after this, Edmund de Cailou, a knight of Gascony, whom Edw7ard had appointed to be gover nor of Berwick, was encountered by Douglas, as the foreigner returned to England loaded with plunder, from an inroad into Teviotdale. Cailou was killed ; and, after the slaughter of many of the foreign mer cenaries, the accumulated booty of the Merse and Teviotdale was recovered by the Scots. Exactly similar to that of Cailou, was the fate of Sir Ralph Neville. This baron, on hearing the high report of Douglas's prowess, from some of De Cailou's fugitive soldiers, openly boasted that he would fight with the Scottish knight, if he would come and show his banner before Berwick. Douglas, who deemed himself bound to accept the challenge, immediately marched into the neighbourhood of that town, and, within sight of the garrison, caused a party of his men to waste the country, and burn the villages. Neville instantly quitted Berwick with a strong body of men, and, en camping upon a high ground, waited till the Scots should disperse to plunder ; but Douglas called in his 1 Barbour, p. 323."], [317, "1317. ROBERT BRUCE. 309 detachment, and instantly marched against the enemy. After a desperate conflict, in which many were slain, Douglas, as was his custom, succeeded in bringing the leader to a personal encounter ; and the superior strength and skill of the Scottish knight were again successful. Neville was slain, and his men utterly discomfited.1 An old English chronicle ascribes this disaster to \" the treason of the marchers ;\" but it is difficult to discover in what the treason consisted. Many other soldiers of distinction were taken pri soners ; and Douglas, without opposition, ravaged the country, drove away the cattle, left the towns and villages in flames, and returned to Scotland. So ter rible did the exploits of this hardy warrior become upon the borders, that Barbour, who lived in his time, informs us, the English mothers were accustomed to pacify their children by threatening them with the name of the \" Black Douglas.\"2 Repulsed with so much disgrace in these attempts by land, the English monarch fitted out a fleet, and invaded Scotland, sailing into the Firth of Forth, and landing his armament at Dunybirstle. The panic created by the English was so great, that the sheriff of the county had difficulty in assembling five hun dred cavalry ; and these, intimidated by the superior numbers of the enemy, disgracefully took to flight. Fortunately, however, a spirited prelate, Sinclair bishop of Dunkeld, who had more in him of the war rior than the ecclesiastic, received timely notice of this desertion. Putting himself at the head of sixty of his servants, and with nothing clerical about him, except a linen frock, or rochet, cast over his armour, he threw himself on horseback, and succeeded in rally- 1 Leland, Collect, vol. i. p. 547.

On his return from Ireland, Bruce highly commended his spirit, declaring that Sinclair should be his own bishop ; and by the name of the king's bishop this hardy prelate was long remembered in Scotland.1 Unable to make any impression with temporal arms, the King of England next had recourse to the thunders of spiritual warfare ; and in the servile character of Pope John the Twenty-second, he found a fit tool for his purpose. By a bull, issued from Avignon, in the beginning of 1317, the pope commanded the obser vance of a truce between the hostile countries for two years ; but the style of this mandate evinced a decided partiality to England. Giving the title of King of England to Edward, he only designated Bruce as his beloved son, \" carrying himself as King of Scotland ;\"2 and when he despatched two cardinals as his legates into Britain, for the purpose of publishing this truce upon the spot, they were privately empowered, in case of any opposition, to inflict upon the King of Scotland the highest spiritual censures. In the same secret manner, he furnished them with a bull, to be made public if circumstances so required, by which Robert Bruce and his brother Edward were declared excom municated persons.3 The pope also directed another 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 259. 2 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. iii. p. 594. 3 Dated 4th April, 1317."], [319, "1317. ROBERT BRUCE. 311 bull against the order of Minorite friars, who, by their discourses, had instigated the Irish to join the Scottish invaders, and rise in rebellion against the English government. These attempts to deprive him of his just rights, and to overawe him into peace, were met by a firm resistance on the part of Bruce ; who, placed in a trying and delicate situation, evinced, in his opposition to the papal interference, a remarkable union of unshaken courage, with sound judgment and good temper ; contriving to maintain the independence of his crown, whilst, at the same time, he professed all due respect for the authority of his spiritual father, as head of the church. Charged with their important commissions, the cardinals arrived in England at the time when Lewis de Beaumont was about to be consecrated Bishop of Durham. Their first step was to despatch two nuncios, the Bishop of Corbeil and Master Aumery,1 who were intrusted with the delivery of the papal letters to the Scottish king, and with the bulls of excommunication. As Durham lay on their road, Master Aumery and his brother nuncio set out with the bishop-elect, and a splendid suite of churchmen and barons, intending to be present at the inauguration. But it proved an ill-fated journey for these unfortunate envoys. The borders at this time were in a wild and disorderly state. Many of the gentry and barons of England, as already noticed, had entered into armed associations for the defence of the marches, against the destructive inroads of the Scots ; but the habits of loose warfare, the extremities of famine, and the unpopularity of the king's person and government, had, in the course of years, transformed themselves and their soldiers 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. iii. p. 661 ."], [320, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1317. 312 into robbers who mercilessly ravaged the country.1 Anxious in every way to increase the confusions which then distracted the English government, the King of Scotland kept up an intelligence with these marauders ; and, on the present occasion, aware of the hostility which was meditated against him by the cardinals, and of their attachment to his enemy, it seems very pro bable that he employed two leaders of these broken men, Gilbert de Middleton and Walter Selby, to inter cept the nuncios, and make themselves masters of their letters and secret instructions. It is certain that, on the approach of the cavalcade to Rushy Ford, a large body of soldiers, headed by these lawless chiefs, rushed out from a wood near the road, and in a short time made the whole party prisoners ; seized and stript of their purple and scarlet apparel the unfortunate church men ; rifled and carried off their luggage and horses ; but, without offering violence to their persons, dismissed them to prosecute their journey to Scotland. The bishop-elect, and his brother Henry de Beaumont, were carried to Middleton's castle of Mitford ; nor were they liberated from their dungeon till their plate, jewels, and the rich vestments of the cathedral, were sold to raise money for their ransom.2 Meanwhile, the papal nuncios, in disconsolate plight, proceeded into Scotland, and arrived at court. Bruce received them courteously, and listened with attention to the message with which they were charged.3 Hav ing then consulted with those of his counsellors who were present, upon the proposals, he replied, that he earnestly desired a firm peace between the kingdoms, 1 Walsingham, p. 107. 2 Tyrrel, Hist. vol. iii. p. 269.

These letters may possibly be addressed to them ; and it is for this reason, that although I have permitted the papal letters, which advise a peace, to be read, as well as your open letters on the same subject, yet to these, as they refuse to me my title of king, I will give no answer ; nor will I by any means suffer your sealed letters, which are not directed to the King of Scotland, to be opened in my presence.\" The nuncios upon this endeavoured to offer an apology for the omission, by observing, that it was not customary for our holy mother the church either to do or to say any thing during the dependence of a controversy, which might prejudice the right of either of the parties. \" If, then,\" replied Bruce, \" my spiritual father and my holy mother have professed themselves unwilling to create a prejudice against my opponent, by giving to me the title of king, I am at a loss to determine why they have thought proper to prejudice my cause, by withdrawing that title from me during the dependence of the controversy. I am in possession of the kingdom. All my subjects call me king, and by that title do other kings and royal princes address me ; but I perceive that my spiritual parents assume an evident partiality amongst their sons. Had"], [322, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1317. 314 you,\" he continued, \" presumed to present letters so addressed to other kings, you might have received an answer in a different style. But I reverence your authority, and entertain all due respect for the holy see.\" The messengers now requested that the king would command a temporary cessation of hostilities. \" To this,\" replied Bruce, \" I can by no means con sent, without the advice of my parliament, and espe cially whilst the English are in the daily practice of spoiling the property of my subjects, and invading all parts of my realm.\" During this interview, the king expressed himself with great courtesy, professing all respect for his spiritual father, and delivering his resolute answers with a mild and placid countenance.1 The two nuncios, it seems, had taken along with them into the king's presence another papal messenger, who, having come some time before to inform the Scottish prelates of the coronation of the pope, had been refused admission into Scotland. For this person, who had now waited some months without being permitted to execute his mission, the messengers entreated the king's indulgence ; but Bruce, although the discarded envoy stood in the presence-chamber, took no notice of him, and changed the subject wTith an expression of coun tenance, which at once imposed silence, and intimated a refusal. When the nuncios questioned the secretaries of the king regarding the cause of this severity, they at once replied, that their master conceived that these letters had not been addressed to him, solely because the pope was unwilling to give him his royal titles. The Scottish councillors informed the nuncios, that if the letters had been addressed to the King of Scots, the negociations for peace would have immediately 1 These interesting particulars we learn from the original Utter of the nuncios themselves.

ROBERT BRUCE. 315 commenced ; but that neither the king nor his advisers would hear of a treaty, so long as the royal title was withheld, seeing that they were convinced that this slight had been put upon their sovereign through the influence of England, and in contempt of the people of Scotland.1 Repulsed by Bruce with so much firmness and dig nity, the Bishop of Corbeil returned with haste to the cardinals. They had remained all this time at Durham ; and anxious to fulfil their mission, they now deter mined at all hazards to publish the papal truce in Scotland. For this purpose the papal bulls and instruments were intrusted to Adam Newton, the father-guardiau of the Minorite friars of Berwick, who was commanded to repair to the presence of Bruce, and to deliver the letters of his holiness to the King of Scotland, as well as to the Bishop of St Andrews, and the Scottish prelates. Newton accordingly set out for Scotland, but, anticipating no cordial reception, cautiously left the papal bulls and letters at Berwick, until he should be assured of a safe-conduct. After a journey of much hardship and peril, the friar found King Robert encamped with his army, in a wood near Old Cambus, a small town about twelve miles distant from Berwick, busily engaged in constructing warlike engines for the assault of that city, although it was now the middle of December. Having conferred with Lord Alexander Seton, the seneschal of the king, and received a safe-conduct, Newton returned for his papers and credentials to Berwick, and again repaired to Old Cambus. He was then informed by Seton, that Bruce would not admit him to a personal interview, but that he must deliver to him his letters, in order to their 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. iii. p. 661."], [324, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1317. 316 being inspected by the king, who was anxious to ascer tain whether their contents were friendly or hostile. Newton obeyed ; and Bruce, observing that the letters and papal instruments were not addressed to him as King of Scotland, returned them to the friar with much contempt, declaring that he would on no account obey the bulls, so long as his royal titles were withheld, and that he was determined to make himself master of Berwick. The envoy then publicly declared, before the Scottish barons, and a great concourse of specta tors, that a two years' truce was, by the authority of the pope, to be observed by the two kingdoms ; but his proclamation was treated with such open marks of insolence and contempt, that he began to tremble for the safety of his person, and earnestly implored them to permit him to pass forward into Scotland, to the presence of those prelates with whom he was com manded to confer, or at least to have a safe-conduct back again to Berwick. Both requests were denied him ; and he was commanded, without delay, to make the best of his way out of the country. On his way to Berwick, the unfortunate monk was waylaid by four armed ruffians, robbed of his letters and papers, amongst which were the bulls excommunicating the King of Scotland, and, after being stript to the skin, turned naked upon the road. \" It is rumoured,\" says he, in an interesting letter addressed to the cardinals, containing the account of his mission, \" that the Lord Robert and his accomplices, who instigated this out rage, are now in possession of the letters intrusted to me.\"1 There can be little doubt that the rumour rested on a pretty good foundation. Throughout the whole of this negotiation, the pope 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. iii. pp. 683, 684."], [325, "1317-18. ROBERT BRUCE. 317 was obviously in the interest of the King of England. Edward's intrigues at the Roman court, and the pen sions which he bestowed on the cardinals, induced his holiness to proclaim a truce, which, in the present state of English affairs, was much to be desired ; but Bruce, supported by his own clergy, and secure of the affections of his people, despised all papal interference, and succeeded in maintaining the dignity and inde pendence of his kingdom. Having rid himself of such troublesome opposition, the Scottish king determined to proceed with the siege of Berwick, a town which, as the key to England, was at this time fortified in the strongest manner. For tunately for the Scots, Edward had committed its defence to a governor, whose severity, and strict adher ence to discipline, had disgusted some of the burgesses ; and one of these, named Spalding,1 who had married a Scotswoman, was seduced from his allegiance, and determined, on the night when it was his turn to take his. part in the watch rounds, to assist the enemy in an escalade. This purpose he communicated to the Marshal, and he carried the intelligence directly to Bruce himself, who was not slow in taking advantage of it.2 Douglas and Randolph, along writh March, were commanded to assemble with a chosen body of men at Duns Park in the evening ; and at nightfall, having left their horses at the rendezvous, they marched to Berwick ; and, by the assistance of Spalding, fixed their ladders, and scaled the walls. Orders seem to have been given by Bruce, that they should not pro ceed to storm the town, till reinforced by a stronger 1 Hardynge in his Chronicle, p. 308, Ellis's edition, tells us, that Spalding, after betraying the town, went into Scotland, and was slain by the Scots. 2 Barbour, p. 334."], [326, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1318. 318 body ; but Douglas and Randolph found it impossible to restrain their men, who dispersed themselves through the streets, to slay and plunder, whilst, panic-struck with the night attack, the citizens escaped over the walls, or threw themselves into the castle. When day arrived, this disobedience of orders had nearly been fatal to the Scots ; for Roger Horsley, the governor of the castle,1 discovering that there were but a hand ful of men, made a desperate sally, and all but recovered the city. Douglas, however, and Randolph, who were veterans in war, and dreaded such an event, had kept their own soldiers well together, and, assisted by a young knight, Sir William Keith of Galston, who greatly distinguished himself, they at last succeeded in driving the English back to the castle ; thus hold ing good their conquest of the town, till Bruce came up with the rest of his army, and effectually secured it. The presence of the king, with the men of Merse and Teviotdale, intimidated the garrison of the castle, which soon surrendered ; and Bruce, with that gene rous magnanimity which forms so fine a part of his character, disdaining to imitate the cruelty of Edward the First, readily gave quarter to all who were willing to accept it. For this we have the testimony of the English historians, Thomas de la More, and Adam Murimuth, although the pope, in his bull of excom munication, represents him as having seized Berwick by treachery during a time of truce ; and charges him, 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. p. 175, 19th August. Lord Hailes, vol. ii. p. 78, seems to think it an error in Tyrrel, to imagine that there was a governor of the town, and a governor of the castle. But Tyrrel is in the right. John of Witham was governor or warden of the town, Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. p. 178, 30th Sept., 1317 ; and Roger of Horsle, governor of the castle, Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, p. 175.

Both accusations are unfounded.1 The truce was publicly disclaimed by the king, and the city was treated with uncommon lenity. It was at this time the chief commercial em porium of England, and its plunder greatly enriched the Scottish army. There was also found in it great quantities of provisions and military stores ; and Bruce, after having examined the fortifications, determined to make it an exception from his general rule of demo lishing all fortresses recovered from the English.2 In execution of this plan, he committed the keeping of both town and castle to his son-in-law, Walter the Steward ; and aware that, from its importance, the English would soon attempt to recover it, he provided it with everv sort of warlike engine then used in the defence of fortified places. Springalds and cranes, with huge machines for discharging iron darts, called balist\u00e6 de turno, wTere stationed on the walls ; a large body of archers, spearmen, and cross-bowmen, formed the garrison ; and the young Steward was assisted in his measures of defence by John Crab, a Fleming, famous for his skill in the rude engineering of the times.3 Five hundred brave gentlemen, who quartered the arms of the Steward, repaired to Berwick, to the support of their chief; and Bruce, having left it vic tualled for a year, marched with his army into England, and ravaged and laid waste the country. He besieged and made himself master of the castles of Wark and 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. iii. pp. 708, 709. 2 Fordun a Goodal, p. 245. 3 Barbour, pp. 339, 340.

Harbottle, surprised Mitford, and having penetrated into Yorkshire, burnt the towns of Northallerton, Boroughbridge, Scarborough, and Skipton in Craven. The plunder in these expeditions was great ; and the number of the captives may be estimated from the expression of an ancient English chronicle, that the Scots returned into their own country, driving their prisoners like flocks of sheep before them.1 Irritated at the contempt of their authority, the cardinal legates solemnly excommunicated Bruce 2 and his adherents ; whilst Edward, after an ineffectual attempt to conciliate his parliament and keep together his army, was compelled, by their violent animosities, to disband his troops, and allow the year to pass away in discontent and inactivity. Meanwhile, the death of King Edward Bruce, in Ireland, and of Marjory, the king's daughter, who left an only son, Robert, afterwards king, rendered some new enactments ne cessary regarding the succession to the throne. A parliament was accordingly assembled at Scone in December, in which the whole clergy and laity renewed their engagements of obedience to the king, and pro mised to assist him faithfully, to the utmost of their power, in the preservation and defence of the rights and liberties of the kingdom, against all persons of whatever strength, power, and dignity, they may be ; and any one who should attempt to violate this engage ment and ordinance, was declared guilty of treason.

It was also declared, that since, in certain times past, some doubts had arisen regarding the succession of the kingdom of Scotland, the parliament thought proper to express their opinion, that this succession ought not to have been regulated, and henceforth should not be determined, by the rules of inferior fiefs and inheritances, but that the male heir nearest to the king, in the direct line of descent, should succeed to the crowm ; and failing him, the nearest female in the direct line; and failing the whole direct line, the nearest male heir in the collateral line \u2014 respect being always had to the right of blood by which the last king reigned, which seemed agreeable to the imperial law.1 This enactment having been unanimously agreed to, Randolph and Douglas came forward, and, after accept ing the offices provisionallyconferred upon them, swore, with their hands on the holy gospels and the relics of the saints, faithfully and diligently to discharge their duty, and to observe, and cause to be observed, the laws and customs of Scotland.

All men were required to array themselves for war. Every layman possessed of land, who had ten pounds worth of moveable property, was commanded to provide himself with an acton and a basnet, that is, a leathern jacket, and a steel helmet, together with gloves of plate, and a sword and spear. Those who were not thus provided, were enjoined to have an iron jack, or back and breast-plate of iron, an iron head piece, or knapiskay, with gloves of plate ; and every man possessing the value of a cow, was commanded to arm himself with a bow and a sheaf of twenty-four arrows, or with a spear.1 It was made imperative upon all sheriffs and lords to insist on the execution of this law ; and in case of disobedience, to cause the recusant to forfeit his moveable estate, half to the king, and half to his overlord, or superior. All per sons, while on the road to the royal army, were com manded to subsist at their own charges ; those who camefrom places near the rendezvous being commanded to bring carriages and provisions along^with them, and those from remote parts to bring money ; and if, upon an offer of payment, such necessaries were refused, the troops were authorized, at the sight of the magistrates or bailies of the district, to take wrhat was withheld. All persons were strictly prohibited from supplying the enemy with armour or horses, bows and arrows, or any kind of weapons, or to give to the English assistance in any shape whatever, and this under the penalty of being guilty of a capital offence. All eccle siastics were prohibited from transmitting to the papal 1 Regiam Majestatem. Statutes of King Robert I. See Cartulary fif Aberbrothock, p. 283. M'Farlane Transcript."], [331, "1318-19.

He then strictly invested the town from the Tweed to the sea, and at the same time the English fleet entered the estuary of the river, so that the city was beleaguered on all points. This was in the begin ning of September ; and from the strength of the army and the quality of the leaders, much was expected.3 The first assault wras made on the seventh of the month : it had been preceded by great preparations, and mounds of earth had been erected against that part of the walls where it was expected there would be the greatest facility in storming. Early in the morning of St Mary's Eve, the trumpets of the Eng lish were heard, and the besiegers advanced in various bodies, well provided with scaling-ladders, scaffolds, and defences, with hoes and pickaxes for mining, and under cover of squadrons of archers and slingers. The assault soon became general, and continued with 1 Regiam Majestatem. Stat.

The topmasts of this vessel, and her boat, which was drawn up half-mast high, were manned with soldiers ; and to the bow of the boat w7as fitted a species of drawbridge, which was intended to be dropt upon the wall, and to afford a passage from the ship into the town. The walls themselves, which were not more than a spear's length in height, afforded little defence against these serious prepara tions ; but the Scots, animated by that feeling of confidence which a long train of success had inspired, and encouraged by the presence and example of the Steward, effectually repulsed the enemy on the land side, whilst the ship, which had struck upon a bank, was left dry by the ebbing of the tide ; and being attacked by a party of the enemy, was soon seen blazing in the mouth of the river. Disheartened by this double failure, the besiegers drew off their forces, and, for the present, intermitted all attack.1 But it was only to commence new preparations for a more desperate assault. In case of a second failure in their escalade, it was determined to undermine the walls ; and for this purpose a huge machine was constructed, covered by a strong roofing of boards and hides, and holding within its bosom large bodies of armed soldiers and miners. From its shape and covering, this formidable engine was called a sow. To co-operate with the machine, moveable scaffolds, high enough to overtop the walls, and capable of receiving parties of armed men, were erected for the 1 Barbour, pp. 345, 346."], [333, "ROBERT BRUCE. 1319. 325 attack ; and undismayed at his first failure by sea, EdwTard commanded a number of ships to be fitted out similar to that vessel which had been burnt ; but with this difference, that in addition to the armed boats, slung half-mast high, their topcastles were full of archers, under wThose incessant and deadly dis charge, it was expected that the assailants would drag the ships so near the walls, as to be able to fix their moveable bridges on the capstone.1 Meanwhile the Scots were not idle. Under the direction of Crab, the Flemish engineer, they constructed two machines of great strength, similar to the Roman catapult, wThich moved on frames, fitted with wheels, and by which stones of a large size were propelled with steady aim and destructive force. Springalds were stationed on the wralls, which were smaller engines, like the ancient balist\u00e6, and calculated for the projection of heavy darts, winged with copper; iron chains, with grappling hooks attached to them, and piles of fire-fagots, mixed with bundles of pitch and flax, bound into large masses, shaped like casks, were in readiness ; and to second the ingenuity of Crab, an English engineer, who had been taken pri soner in the first assault, was compelled to assist in the defence. The young Steward assigned, as before, to each of his officers a certain post on the walls, and put himself at the head of the reserve, with which he determined to watch, and, if necessary, to reinforce the various points. Having completed these arrange ments, he calmly awaited the attack of the English, which was made with great fury early in the morn ing of the 13th of September. To the sound of trumpet and war-horns, their various divisions moved 1 Barbour, pp. 351, 352."], [334, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1319. 326 resolutely forward ; and, in spite of all discharges from the walls, succeeded in filling up the ditch, and fixing their ladders ; but, after a conflict which lasted from sunrise till noon, they found it impossible to over come the gallantry of the Scots, and were beaten back on every quarter. At this moment the King of Eng land ordered the sow to be advanced ; and the Eng lish, aware that if they allowed the Scottish engineers time to take a correct aim, a single stone from the catapult would be fatal, dragged it on with great eagerness. Twice was the aim taken, and twice it failed. The first stone flew over the machine, the second fell short of it ; the third, an immense mass, which passed through the air with a loud booming noise, hit it directly in the middle with a dreadful crash, and shivered, its strong roof-timbers into a thousand pieces. Such of the miners and soldiers who escaped death, rushed out from amongst the fragments ; and the Scots, raising a shout, cried out that the English sow had farrowed her pigs.1 Crab, the engineer, immediately cast his chains and grap pling hooks over the unwieldy machine, and having effectually prevented its removal, poured down burn ing fagots upon its broken timbers, and consumed it to ashes. Nor were the English more fortunate in their attack upon the side of the river. Their ships, indeed, moved up towards the walls at flood-tide ; but whether from the shallowness of the water, or the faint-heartedness of their leaders, the attack entirely failed. One of the vessels which led the way, on coming within range of the catapult, was struck by a large stone, which damaged her, and killed and mangled some of the crew ; upon which the remaining 1 Barbour, p. 354."], [335, "1319. ROBERT BRUCE. 327 ships, intimidated by the accident, drew off from the assault. A last effort of the besiegers, in which they endeavoured to set fire to St Mary's Gate, was re pulsed by the Steward in person; and at nightfall, the English army, foiled on every side, and greatly disheartened, entirely withdrew from the assault.1 The spirit with which the defence was carried on, may be estimated from the circumstance, that the women and boys in the town, during the hottest sea son of the assault, supplied the soldiers on the walls with bundles of arrows and stones for the engines. Although twice beaten off, it was yet likely that the importance of gaining Berwick would have in duced the King of England to attempt a third attack ; but Bruce determined to raise the siege by making a diversion on a large scale, and directed Randolph and Douglas, at the head of an army of fifteen thousand men, to invade England. During the presence of her husband at the siege of Berwick, the Queen of Eng land had taken up her quarters near York ; and it was the plan of these twro veteran warriors, by a rapid and sudden march through the heart of Yorkshire, to seize the person of the queen, and, wTith this precious cap tive in their bauds, to dictate the terms of peace to her husband.2 Bruce, who, in addition to his talents in the field, had not neglected to avail himself in every way of Edward's unpopularity, appears to have esta blished a secret correspondence, not only with the Earl of Lancaster, who was then along writh his mas ter before Berwick, but writh others about the queen's person.3 The plan had in consequence very nearly 1 Barbour, p. 357. 2 \" Certe si capta fuisset tune Regina, credo quod pacem emisset sibi Scocia.\" M. Malmesburiensis, p. 192. 3 Walsingham, pp. Ill, 112."], [336, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1319. 328 been successful ; but a Scottish prisoner, who fell into the hands of the English, gave warning of the medi tated attack, and Randolph, on penetrating to York, found the prey escaped, and the court removed to a distance. Incensed at this disappointment, they ravaged the surrounding country with merciless execu tion, marking their progress by the flames and smoke of towns and castles, and collecting much plunder. The military strength of the country was at this time before Berwick, and nothing remained but the forces of the church, and of the vassals who held lands by military service to the archiepiscopal see. These were hastily assembled by William de Melton, the Archbishop of York, assisted by the Bishop of Ely;1 and a force of twenty thousand men, but of a motley description, proceeded to intercept the Scots. Multi tudes of priests and monks, whose shaved crowns suited ill with the steel basnet ; large bodies of the feudal militia of the church, but hastily levied, and imperfectly disciplined ; the Mayor of York, with his train-bands and armed burgesses, composed the army which the archbishop, emulous, perhaps, of the fame which had been acquired in the battle of the Standard, by his predecessor Thurstin, too rashly determined to lead against the experienced soldiers of Randolph and Douglas. The result was what might have been ex pected. The Scots were encamped at Mytton, near the small river Swale. Across the stream there was then a bridge, over wrhich the English army defiled. Whilst thus occupied, some large stacks of hay were set on fire by the enemy,2 and, under cover of a dense mass of smoke, a strong column of men threw them selves between the English army and the bridge. As 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. p. 202. 4th Sept. 13 Edward II. 2 Hardynge's Chronicle, p. 309."], [337, "1319. ROBERT BRUCE. 329 the smoke cleared away, they found themselves at tacked with great fury both in front and rear, by the fatal long spear of the Scottish infantry ; and the army of the archbishop was in a few moments entirely broken and dispersed.1 In an incredibly short time, four thousand were slain, and amongst these many priests, whose white surplices covered their armour. Great multitudes were drowned in attempting to recross the river; and it seems to have been fortunate for the English that the battle was fought in the evening, and that a September night soon closed upon the field ; for had it been a morning attack, it is probable that Randolph and Douglas would have put the whole army to the sword. Three hundred ecclesiastics fell in this battle ; from which circumstance, and in allu sion to the prelates who led the troops, it was deno minated, in the rude pleasantry of the times, \" The Chapter of Mytton.\" When the news of the disaster reached the camp before Berwick, the troops began to murmur ; and the Earl of Lancaster soon after, in a fit of disgust, deserted the leaguer with his whole followers, composing nearly a third part of the army.2 Edward immediately raised the siege, and made a spirited effort to intercept Douglas and Randolph on their return, and compel them to fight at a disadvan tage ; but he had to deal with veteran soldiers, whose secret information was accurate, and who were inti mately acquainted writh the border passes. While he attempted to intercept them by one road, they had already taken another ; and leaving their route to be traced, as their advance had been, by the flames and smoke of villages and hamlets, they returned, without 1 J. de Trokelowe, p. 45.

It may give some idea of the far-spreading devastation occasioned by this and similar inroads of the Scottish army, when it is stated, that in an authentic document in the F\u0153dera Angli\u00e6, it appears that eighty-four towns and villages were burnt and pillaged by the army of Randolph and Douglas in this expedition. These, on account of the great losses sustained, are, by a royal letter addressed to the tax-gatherers of the West Riding of Yorkshire, exempted from all contribution -,1 and in this list the private castles and hamlets which were destroyed in the same fiery inroad, do not appear to be included. Bruce could not fail to be particularly gratified by these successes. Berwick, not only the richest com mercial town in England, but of extreme importance as a key to that country, remained iu his hands, after a siege directed by the King of England in person ; and the young warrior, who had so bravely repulsed the enemy, was the Steward of Scotland, the husband of his only daughter, on whom the hopes and wishes of the nation mainly rested. The defeat upon the Swale was equally destructive and decisive ; and it was followed up by another expedition of the restless and indefatigable Douglas, who, about All-Hallow tide of the same year, when the northern borders had gathered in their harvest, broke into and burnt Gills land and the surrounding country, ravaged Borough on-Stanmore, and came sweeping home through West moreland and Cumberland, driving his cattle and his prisoners before him, and cruelly adding to the miseries of the recent famine, by a total destruction 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. iii. pp. 801, 802."], [339, "ROBERT BRUCE. 1319. 331 of the agricultural produce, which had been laid up for the winter.1 It was a part of the character of Bruce, which marked his great abilities, that he knew as well when to make peace as to pursue war ; and that, after any success, he could select the moment best fitted for permanently securing to his kingdom the advantages which, had he reduced his enemy to extremity, might have eluded his grasp. The natural consequence of a long series of defeats sustained by Edward, was an anxious desire upon his own part, and that of his par liament, for a truce between the kingdoms;2 and as the Scots were satiated with victory, and, to use the words of an English historian, so enriched by the plunder of England that that country could scarcely afford them more, the Scottish king lent a ready ear to the representations of the English commissioners, and agreed to a truce for twTo years between the kingdoms, to commence from Christmas 1319. Conservators of the truce were appointed by England ;3 and, in the meantime, commissioners of both nations were directed to continue their conferences, with the hope of con cluding a final peace. 1 Hume's Douglas and Angus, vol. i. p. 70. 2 Walsingham, p. 112. \" Igitur Rex, sentiens quotidie sua damna cumulari, de communi consilio in treugas jurat biennales, Scotis libenter has acceptantibus, non tamen quia jam fuerant bellis fatigati, sed quia fuerant Anglica pr\u00e6da ditati.\" Lingard says nothing of the request of the parliament, that Edward would enter into a truce with the Scots, but observes, that the first proposal for a negotiation came from Scotland, and that the demand for the regal title was waved by Bruce. The truce itself is not published in Rymer, so that there is no certain proof that Bruce waved the regal title ; and although, in the document in Rymer, vol. iii. p. 806, Edward, in a letter to the pope, states, that Bruce made proposals for a truce, the evidence is not conclusive, as Edward, in his public papers, did not scruple to conceal his disasters, by assuming a tone of superiority, when his affairs were at the lowest ebb. 3 This is said to he the first instance of the appointment of con servators of truce for the borders.

The insults which this prince has heaped upon us, the slaughters and devas tations which he has committed ; his imprisonments of prelates, his burning of monasteries, his spoliations and murder of priests, and the other enormities of which he has been guilty, can be rightly described, or even conceived, by none but an eye-witness. From these innumerable evils have we been freed, under the help of that God who woundeth and who maketh whole, by our most valiant prince and king, Lord Robert, who, like a second Maccab\u00e6us, or Joshua, hath cheerfully endured all labour and weariness, and exposed himself to every species of danger and priva tion, that he might rescue from the hands of the enemy his ancient people and rightful inheritance, whom also Divine Providence, and the right of succession accord ing to those laws and customs, which we will maintain to the death, as well as the common consent of us all, have made our prince and king.

For this purpose, a meeting took place between certain Scottish and English commissioners, which was attended by two envoys from the King of France, who entreated to be allowed to act as a mediator, and by two nuncios from the pope. But Edward was not yet sufficiently humbled to consent to the conditions stipulated by his antagonist ; and Bruce was the less anxious to come to an agreement, as a dangerous civil insurrection, headed by the Earl of Lancaster, his secret friend and 1 A sac-simile of this famous letter was engraved by Anderson, in his Diplomata Scoti\u00e6, plate 51.

William de Soulis, the seneschal, or high-butler of Scotland ; Sir David de Brechin, nephew to the king, an accomplished knight, who had signalized himself in the Holy War; five other knights, Sir Gilbert de Malherbe, Sir John Logie, Sir Eustace de Maxwell, Sir Walter de Berklay, and Sir Patrick de Graham ; with three esquires, Richard Brown, Hameline de Troupe, and Eustace de Rattray, are the only persons whose names have come dowm to us as certainly implicated in the conspiracy. Of these, Sir David de Brechin, along with Malherbe, Logie, and Brown, suffered the punishment of treason.2 The destruction of all record of their trial renders it difficult to throw any light on the details of the plot ; but we have the evidence of a contemporary of high autho rity, that the design of the conspirators was to slay the king, and place the crown on the head of Lord Soulis, a lineal descendant of the daughter of Alex ander II.; and who, as possessing such a claim, would have excluded both Bruce and Baliol, had the legiti macy of his mother been unquestioned.3 There is evidence in the records of the Tower, that both Soulis and Brechin had long tampered with England, and been rewarded for their services. In the case of Brechin we find him enjoying special letters of protection from Edward. In addition to these, he was pensioned in 1 Rymer's F\u0153dera, vol. iii. pp. 866, 884.

It is certain that he was a prisoner of war in Scotland in the year 1315,1 having probably been taken in arms at the battle of Bannockburn. In the five years of glory and success which followed, and in the repeated expeditions of Randolph and Douglas, we do not once meet with his name ; and now, after having been received into favour, he became connected with, or at least connived at, a conspiracy which involved the death of the king. Such a delinquent is little entitled to our sympathy. There was not a single favourable circumstance in his case ; but he was young and brave, he had fought against the infidels, and the people who knew not of his secret treasons, could not see him suffer without pity and regret.2 Soulis, who, with a retinue of three hundred and sixty esquires, had been seized at Ber wick, was imprisoned in Dunbarton, where he soon after died ; and Maxwell, Berklay, Graham, Troupe, and Rattray, were tried and acquitted. The parlia ment in which these trials and condemnations took place, was held at Scone in the beginning of August 1320, and long remembered in Scotland under the name of the Black Parliament.3 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. iii. p. 311.

The Earl of Lancaster, who, along with the Earl of Hereford and other English barons, had entered into a treaty of alliance with Bruce, and concerted an invasion of England, to be conducted by the King of Scotland in person,1 was defeated and taken prisoner by Sir Andrew Hartcla and Sir Simon Ward, near Pontefract ; his army was totally routed, and he himself soon after executed for treason. In the battle the Earl of Hereford was slain, others of the discontented nobility shared the fate of Lan caster; and the dangerous faction which had for so many years been a thorn in the side of the king, was entirely broken and put down. Exulting at this suc cess, Edward determined to collect an army which should at once enable him to put an end to the war ; and, in a tone of premature triumph, wrote to the pope, \" requesting him to give himself no farther trouble about a truce with the Scots, as he had determined to establish a peace by force of arms.\" 2 In furtherance of this resolution, he proceeded to issue his writs for the attendance of his military vassals ; but so ill were these obeyed, that four months were lost before the force assembled ; and in this interval the Scots, with their usual strength and fury, broke into England, led by the king in person, wasted with fire and sword the six northern counties, which had scarcely drawn breath from a visitation of the same kind by Randolph, and returned to Scotland loaded with booty, consisting of herds of sheep and oxen, quantities of gold and silver, ecclesiastical plate and ornaments, jewels, and table equipage, which they piled in wagons, and drove off 1 F\u0153dera, vol. iii. pp. 938, 939. 2 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. iii. p. 944."], [347, "1322. ROBERT BRUCE. 339 at their pleasure.1 Meanwhile Edward continued his preparations, which, although dilatory, were on a great scale.- A supply of lancemen and cross-bowmen was demanded from his foreign subjects of Aquitaine, along with a due proportion of wdieat, and a thousand tuns of wine for the use of his army ; every village and hamlet in England was commanded to furnish one foot-soldier fully armed, and the larger towns and cities were taxed proportionally to their size and importance. A parliament held at York, in the end of July, granted large subsidies from the nobles and the clergy, the cities, towns, aud burghs ; a fleet of transports, with provisions, was sent round to enter the Forth ; and an offensive squadron, under the command of Sir John Leybourn, was fitted out for the attack of the west coast and the islands. All things being ready, Edward invaded Scotland at the head of an army of a hundred thousand men ; 3 but the result of the expedition was lamentably disproportionate to the magnitude of his promises and his preparations ; and manifested, in a striking manner, the superior talents and policy of Bruce. No longer bound, as at Bannockburn, by the rash engagement of his brother to risk his kingdom upon the fate of a battle, which he must have fought with a greatly disproportionate force, the king determined to make the numbers of the English army the cause of their ruin : to starve them in an enemy's country, and then to fall upon them when, enfeebled by want, they could offer little resistance. Accordingly, on advancing to Edinburgh, the English found themselves 1 Knighton, p. 2542.

The cattle and the sheep, the stores of corn and victuals, and the valuable effects of every kind, throughout the districts of the Merse, Teviotdale, and the Lothians, had entirely disappeared ; the warlike population, which were expected to debate the advance of the army, had retired under the command of the King of Scotland to Culross, on the north side of the Firth of Forth ; and Edward having in vain wraited for supplies by his fleet, wThich contrary winds prevented entering the Firth, wras compelled by famine to give orders for a retreat.1 The moment the English began their march homewards, the Scots commenced the fatal partisan warfare in which Douglas and Randolph were such adepts ; hung upon their rear, cut off the stragglers, and were ready to improve every advan tage. An advanced party of three hundred strong, were put to the sword by Douglas at Melrose ; but the main army, coming up, plundered and destroyed this ancient monastery, spoiled the high altar of its holiest vessels, sacrilegiously casting out the consecra ted host, and cruelly murdering the prior, and some feeble monks, w-ho, from affection or bodily in firmity, had refused to fly.2 Turning off by Dryburgh, the disappointed invaders left this monastery in flames, and hastening through Teviotdale, wTere overjoyed once more to find themselves surrounded by the plenty and comfort of their own country. Yet here a new calamity awaited them ; for the scarcity and famine of an unsuccessful invasion induced the soldiers to give themselves up to unlimited indulgence ; and they were soon attacked by a mortal dysentery, which rapidly 1 Barbour, p. 370. ' Fordun a Hearne, p. 1011."], [349, "1322. ROBERT BRUCE. 341 carried off immense numbers, aud put a finishing stroke to this unhappy expedition, by the loss of sixteen thousand men.1 But Edward was destined to experience still more unhappy reverses. Having collected the scattered remains of his army, and strengthened it by fresh levies, he encamped at Biland abbey, near Malton, in Yorkshire ; and when there, was met by the intelli gence that King Robert, having sat down before Norham castle wTith a powerful force, after some time fruitlessly spent in the siege, had been compelled to retire. Scarce, however, had this good news arrived, when the advanced parties of the Scottish army were descried ; and the English had only time to secure a strong position on the ridge of a hill, before the king was seen marching through the plain with his whole forces, and it became manifest that he meant to attack the English. This, however, from the nature of the ground, was no easy matter. Their soldiers were drawn up along the ridge of a rugged and steep decli vity, assailable only by a single narrow pass, which led to Biland abbey. This pass, Sir James Douglas, with a chosen body of men, undertook to force ; and as he advanced his banner, and the pennons of his knights and squires were marshalling and weaving round him, Randolph, his friend and brother in arms, with four squires, came up, and joined the enterprise as a volunteer. The Scottish soldiers attacked the enemy with the utmost resolution ; but they were re ceived with equal bravery by Sir Thomas Ughtred 2 1 Knighton, p. 2542. Barbour, pp. 373, 374.

It is evidently the same name, and in all probability the same person, as Thomas de Uchtred, mentioned"], [350, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 342 1322. and Sir Ralph Cobham, who fought in advance of the column which defended the pass, and encouraged their men to a desperate resistance. Meanwhile, stones and other missiles were poured down upon the Scots from the high ground ; and this double attack, with the narrowness of the pass, caused the battle to be exceeding obstinate and bloody. Brace, whose eye intently watched every circumstance, determined now to repeat the man\u0153uvre, by which, many years before, he entirely defeated the army of the Lord of Lorn, when it occupied ground similar to the present position of the English. He commanded the men of Argyle and the Isles to climb the rocky ridge, at some dis tance from the pass, and to attack and turn the flank of the force which held the summit. These orders the mountaineers, trained in their own country to this species of warfare, found no difficulty in obeying;1 and the enemy were driven from the heights with great slaughter, whilst Douglas and Raudolph carried the pass, and made way for the main body of the Scottish army. So rapid had been the succession of these events, that the English king, confident in the strength of his position, could scarcely trust his eyes, when he saw his army entirely routed, and flying in all directions ; himself compelled to abandon his camp equipage, baggage, and treasure, and to consult his safety by a precipitate flight, pursued by, the young Steward of Scotland, at the head of five hundred horse. It was with difficulty he escaped to Bridlington, having lost the privy seal in the confusion of the day.2 This was the second time during this weak and inglorious reign, in vol. iii. p. 963, of the F\u0153dera, as the keeper of the castle and hon our of Pickering, and described as being of the county of York. 1 Barbour, p. 376. 2 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. iii. p. 977."], [351, "1322. ROBERT BRUCE. 343 that the privy seal of England had been lost amid the precipitancy of the king's flight from the face of his enemies. First, in the disastrous flight from Bannock burn, and now in the equally rapid decampment from the abbey of Biland.1 In this battle, John of Bre tagne earl of Richmond, Henry de Sully grand butler of France, and many other prisoners of note, fell into the hands of the enemy. Richmond was treated by the king wdth unusual severity, commanded into strict confinement, and only liberated after a long captivity, and at the expense of an enormous ransom. The cause of this is said to have been the terms of slight and opprobrium with which he had been heard to ex press himself against Bruce.2 To Sully and other French knights, who had been taken at the same time, the king demeaned himself with that chivalrous and polished courtesy for which he was so distinguished ; assuring them that he wras well aware they had been present in the battle, not from personal enmity to him, but from the honourable ambition that good knights, in a strange land, must ever have to show their prowess ; wherefore he entreated them, as well for their own sake, as out of compliment to his friend, the King of France, to remain at head-quarters. They did so accordingly ; and after some time, on setting out for France, were dismissed, not only free of ran som, but enriched with presents.3 After this decisive defeat, the Scots plundered the whole country to the north of the Humber, and extended their ravages to Beverley, laying waste the East Riding with fire and sword, and levying from the towns and monasteries, which were rich enough to pay for their escape from plunder, large sums of redemption money.4 The 1 Leland, Collect, vol. i. p. 250. 2 Barbour, p. 37i6. 3 Barbour, p. 379. * Ker's Bruce, vol. ii. p. 287"], [352, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1322-3. 344 clergy and inhabitants of Beverley purchased their safety at the rate of four hundred pounds, being six thousand pounds of our present money. Loaded with booty, driving large herds of cattle before them, and rich in multitudes of captives, both of low and high degree, the Scottish army at length returned to their own country.1 The councils of the King of England continued after this to be weakened by dissension and treachery amongst his nobility. Hartcla, who, for his good service in the destruction of the Lancastrian faction, had been created Earl of Carlisle, soon after, imitating the example of Lancaster, entered into a correspon dence with Bruce,2 and organized an extensive confe deracy amongst the northern barons, which had for its object not only to conclude a truce with the Scots, independent of any communication with the king, but to maintain Robert Bruce and his heirs in the right and possession of the entire kingdom of Scotland. On the discovery of the plot, he suffered the death of a traitor, after being degraded from his new honours, and having his gilt spurs hacked off his heels.3 Henry de Beaumont, one of the king's councillors, was soon after this disgraced, and committed to the custody of the marshal, on refusing to give his advice, in terms of 1 Dr Lingard, (vol. iii. p. 442,) following the authority of John de Trokelowe, p. 64, has represented the battle of Biland abbey as a skirmish, in which, after Edward had disbanded his army, Bruce surprised the English king, and the knights and suite who were with him. It appears to me, that the accounts of Barbour, Fordun, and of Lord Hailes, lead to a very different conclusion. In Dr Lingard's narrative, the determined resistance made by the English army, the storming of their encampment, the strong ground in which it was placed, and, indeed, the circumstance that there was an army at all with the king, is omitted. 2 Leland, Collect, vol. i. p. 466. 3 Ker's History of Bruce, p. 289, vol. ii.

Nor was Brace umvilling to entertain pacific overtures. He repelled, indeed, with becoming dignity, a wreak attempt to refuse to acknow ledge him as the principal leader aud party in the truce,2 and insisted on his recognition as chief of his Scottish subjects ; but he consented, by the mediation of his friend, Henry de Sully, to a thirteen-years' truce. This trace, however, he ratified under the style and title of King of Scotland; and this ratifica tion Edward agreed to accept :3 thus virtually acknow ledging the royal title which he affected to deny. But although desirous of peace, the conduct of the English monarch at this time was marked by dissimulation and bad faith. While apparently anxious for a truce, he employed his ambassadors at the papal court to irritate the holy father against Bruce, and to fan the dissensions between them ; he summoned an array of the whole military service of England during the negotiations ; and he recalled Edward Baliol, the son of the late King of Scots, from his castle in Nor mandy, to reside at the English court,4 with the design, as afterwards appeared, of employing him to excite disturbances in Scotland. To counteract these intrigues of England, Bruce despatched his nephew, Randolph, to the papal court ; and the result of his negotiations was in a high degree favourable to Scot land. Flattered by the judicious declarations of his 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. iii. p. 1021. 1 Hailes' Annals, vol. ii. p. 108.

At the same time, Randolph, previous to his return, repaired to the court of France, and there renewed the ancient league between that kingdom and Scot land.4 During these negotiations with the papal court, a son was born to King Robert at Dunfermline,5 w7ho, after a long minority, succeeded his father, under the title of David the Second. It was an event of great 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. iv. p. 29. 2 Hailes, vol. ii. 4to, p. 113. 3 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. iv. p. 46. 4 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 279. 5 On 5th March, 1323.

The discussions were tedious and complicated ; but their particulars do not appear in the state papers of the time. If wre may believe an ancient English his torian,2 it wyas insisted, that all demand of feudal superiority was for ever to be renounced by England ; the fatal stone of Scone, as well as certain manors in England, belonging to the King of Scots, which had been seized by Edward the First, were to be delivered to their rightful owner ; a marriage between the royal blood of England and Scotland wTas to guarantee a lasting peace between the twro kingdoms; and, finally, the whole of the north of England, as far as to the gates of York, was to be ceded to Scotland. This last demand, if really made, must have proceeded from an intention, upon the part of the Scots, to break off all serious negotiation. As soon, indeed, as Bruce became assured of the disingenuous conduct of Ed ward, in continuing his machinations at the papal court, for the purpose of preventing the promised grant of absolution to him and to his people, it was natural that all thoughts of a cordial reconciliation should cease; more especially as the intrigues of 1 \" Iste, manufortis, Anglorum ludet in hortis.\" Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 280. 2 Mon.

Bruce's administration appears to have increased in strength and popularity ; and the royal household, which had been lately glad dened by the birth of a young prince, was now cheered by an important bridal. Christian Brace, the king's sister, and widow of the unfortunate Christopher Seton, espoused a tried and hardy soldier, Sir Andrew Moray of Bothwell, afterwards regent of the kingdom. Moray had been bred to war by Wallace ; and it was a wise part of the policy of Bruce, to attach to him self the bravest soldiers by matrimonial alliances. The joy of the country, however, at these happy events, was, not long after, overclouded by the death of Walter, the High-steward of Scotland, and son-in law to the king. He seems to have been deeply and deservedly lamented. When only a stripling in war, he had done good service at Bannockburn, and after wards increased the promise of his fame by his suc cessful defence of Berwick against the King of Eng land in person.2 A treaty of alliance, offensive and defensive, between France and Scotland, was concluded at Corbeil by Randolph, in which it was agreed to make common cause in all future wars between England and either of the contracting parties ; with the reservation, how ever, upon the part of Robert, that so long as the truce continued, he should be free from the effects of such 1 F\u0153dera, vol. iv. p. 170. 2 Barbour, p. 386.

It is important to notice, that this is the earliest parliament in which we have certain intima tion of the appearance of the representatives of the cities and burghs, as forming a third estate in the great national council. The same parliament, in consequence of the lands aud revenues of the crown having suffered extreme defalcation during the protracted war with England, granted to the king a tenth of the rents of all the lay-lands in the kingdom, to be estimated according to the valuation which was followed during the reign of Alexander the Third.2 A sudden revolution, conducted by Isabella, the profligate Queen of England, and her paramour Morti mer, terminated soon after this in the deposition of Edward the Second, and the assumption of the royal dignity by his son, the great Edward the Third, now entering his fourteenth year.3 Although the avowed intentions of the English regency, who acted as council to the king, wrere pacific, yet their real conduct was insidious and hostile. To Bruce it was even insulting ; for, although they ratified the truce in the name of the young king, and appointed commissioners to renew the negotiations for peace, yet their instructions em powered them to treat with the messengers of the 1 Ker's History of Bruce, vol. ii. p. 343.

He had been disgusted by the re peated instances of bad faith on the part of the English government ; and, taking the advantage of the minority of the king, and the civil dissensions which had greatly weakened the country, he assembled a formidable army on the borders, and declared his resolution of disre garding a truce which had been broken by one of the parties, and of instantly invading England, unless pre vented by a speedy and advantageous peace. Against these warlike preparations the English ministry adopt ed decisive measures. The whole military array of England was summoned to meet the king at Newcastle on the 18th of May ; and the Duke of Norfolk, marshal of England and uncle to young Edward, was com manded to superintend the muster. To Carlisle, the key of the kingdom on the other side, were sent two brave officers, Robert Ufford and John Mowbray, with a reinforcement to Lord Anthony Lucy, the governor. The naval force of the southern ports was ordered to be at Skinburness, near the mouth of the Wampool. Two fleets, one named the Eastern and the other the Western fleet of England, were directed to be em ployed against the Scots. The men living on the borders, and in the northern shires, received orders to join the army with all speed, marching day and night, and to send their women and children for shelter to distant places, or castles ;J and those who were too old to fight were obliged to find a substitute. Anxious to give spirit to the soldiers, and to watch the designs of the enemy, the young king and the rest of the royal 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. p. 208. Hailes, vol. ii. p. 117.

ROBERT BRUCE. 351 family came to York, accompanied by John of Hain ault, with a fine body of heavy-armed Flemish horse ; and Hainault was, not long after, joined by John of Quatremars, at the head of another reinforcement of foreign cavalry.1 Confident in those warlike prepara tions, the negotiations for the attainment of peace soon became cold and embarrassed ; and from the terms proposed by the English commissioners, it was evident that they, as well as Bruce, had resolved upon the prosecution of the war. Accordingly, soon after this, a defiance was brought to the youthful monarch from the King of Scotland ; and the herald was commanded to inform him and his nobles, that the Scots wrere preparing to invade his kingdom with fire and swrord. Bruce himself was about this time attacked by a mortal sickness, brought on by that excessive fatigue, and constant exposure to the inclemency of the seasons, which he had endured in his early wars.2 The extreme weakness occasioned by this, rendered it impossible for him to take the field in person ; but Randolph and Douglas, his two ablest captains, put themselves at the head of an army of ten thousand men, and passing the Tyne near Carlisle, soon showed, that although the king wTas not present, the skill, enterprise, and unshaken courage which he had inspired, continued to animate his soldiers.3 This is one of the last great military expeditions of this reign ; and as it places in a strong and interesting light the species of warfare by which Bruce was enabled to 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. pp. 210, 213. 2 Ker's Bruce, vol. ii. p. 357. 3 Barbour, p. 387.

Froissart, too, one of the most de lightful and graphic of the old historians, appears now in the field, and throws over the picture the tints of his rich feudal painting. Accounts soon reached the English king, that the Scots had broken into the northern counties ; and in stant orders were given for the host to arrange them selves under their respective banners, and advance against the enemy, on the road to Durham. The English army, according to Froissart, consisted of sixty-two thousand men, of which eight thousand were knights and squires, armed both man and horse in steel, and excellently mounted; fifteen thousand lighter armed cavalry, who rode hackneys ; and fifteen thou sand infantry: tothesewereaddedtwenty-fourthousand archers.1 The army was divided into three columns, or battles, all of infantry, each battle having two wings of heavy-armed cavalry of five hundred men. Against this great host, admirable in its discipline and equipment, the Scots had to oppose a very inferior force. It consisted of three thousand knights and squires, armed cap-a-pie, and mounted on strong good horses, and twenty thousand light-armed cavalry, ex cellently adapted for skirmishing, owing to their having along with them no impediments of luggage, or carts and wagons, and their being mounted on hardy little hackneys, which were able to go through their work in the most barren country, where other horses would die of want. \" These Scottishmen,\" says Froissart, \" are exceeding hardy, through their constant wearing 1 Froissart, chap. xxxv. Buchon's Chroniques Francaises, vol. i. p. 80. Barnes's Hist, of Edward III. p. 9."], [361, "1327. ROBERT BRUCE. 353 of arms, and experience in war. When they enter England, they will, in a single day and night, march four-and-twenty miles, taking with them neither bread nor wine ; for such is their sobriety, that they are well content with flesh half sodden, and for their drink with the river water. To them pots and pans are superfluities. They are sure to find cattle enough in the countries they break into, and they can boil or seeth them in their own skins ; so that a little bag of oatmeal, trussed behind their saddle, and an iron plate, or girdle, on wdiich they bake tneir crakenel, or biscuit, and which is fixed between the saddle and the crupper, is their whole purveyance for the field.\" It requires little discernment to see, that a force of this description was admirably adapted for warfare in mountainous and desert countries ; and that a regular army, however excellently equipped, being impeded by luggage, wagons, and camp-followers, could have little chance against it. So, accordingly, the event soon showed. Advancing from York, the English army learnt no tidings of the Scots until they entered Northumber land, when the smoke that rose from the villages and hamlets, which they had burnt in their progress, too plainly indicated their wasting line of march.1 Although the Marshal of England had been stationed at Newcastle with a large body of troops, and the Earl of Hereford and Sir John Mowbray commanded at Carlisle with a strong garrison, the Scottish army had crossed the Tyne with such silence and rapidity, that the blazing villages of Northumberland were the first messengers which informed their enemies of their approach. From morning to night did the English 1 Froissart, vol. i. pp. 19, 20. VOL. I. /"], [362, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1327. 354 for two days pursue these melancholy beacons, without being able to get a sight of their enemy, although they burnt and laid waste the country within five miles of their main army. But the English appear to have been little acquainted with the country, and obliged to march with great slowness and precaution through the woods, marshes, and mountainous passes with which it was intersected ; whilst the Scots, veterans in this species of warfare, and intimately familiar with the seat of the war, drove every living thing from before their enemies, wasted the forage, burnt the granaries, and surrounded their army with a black ened aud smoking desert, through which they passed without a sight of their destroyers. After a vain pursuit of three days, through desert and rugged paths, the English army, exhausted with toil, hunger, and watching, determined to direct their march again to the Tyne, and, having crossed that river, to await the return of the Scots, and cut off their retreat into their own country. This object they accomplished towards nightfall with great difficulty, and the army was kept under arms, each man lying beside his horse with the reins in his hands, ready to mount at a moment's wrarning, with the vain hope that the daylight would show them their enemy, wrho, they conjectured, would return by the same ford which they had crossed in their advance. Meanwhile, this great host began to experience all those bitter sufferings, which the Scottish mode of warfare was so surely cal culated to bring upon them.1 The rain poured down and swelled the river, so that its passage became peril ous ; their carriages and wagons, containing the wine and provisions, had been, by orders of the leaders, left 1 Barnes's Edward III. p. 10."], [363, "1327. ROBERT BRUCE. 355 behind ; and each soldier had carried, strapped behind his saddle, a single loaf of bread, which the rain and the sweat from the horse, had rendered uneatable ; the horses themselves had tasted nothing for a day and night ; and the soldiers experienced the greatest diffi- culty in sheltering themselves from the weather, by cutting down the green branches, and making them- selves lodges, whilst the horses supported themselves by cropping the leaves. There was much suffering also from the want of light and fire, as the green wood would not burn, and only a few of the greater barons had brought torches with them ; so that the army lay on the cold ground under a heavy rain, ignorant, from the darkness, of the situation which they occupied, and obliged to keep upon the alert, lest they should be surprised by the enemy. In this plight the morning found them, when they discovered from the country people that their encampment was about fourteen leagues from Newcastle, and eleven from Carlisle, but could hear no tidings of the Scots.1 It was determined, however, to await their return ; and for eight days they lay upon the bank of the Tyne, in the vain idea of cutting off the retreat of the enemy, while the rain continued to pour down in torrents, and their suffer- ings and privations to increase every hour, so that murmurs and upbraidings began to arise amongst the soldiers ; and the leaders, alarmed by the symptoms of mutiny, determined to repass the river, and again march in search of the enemy. Having accomplished this, proclamation was made through the host, that the king would honour with knighthood, and a grant of land, any soldier who would lead him to where he could cope on dry ground with 1 Froissart, vol. i. pp. 20, 21, 22. The true distance is forty-two miles from Newcastle, and thirty-three from Carlisle."], [364, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1327. 356 the Scots ; 1 and sixteen knights and squires rode off on the adventure, which was quickly accomplished ; for one of them, Thomas de Rokeby, was soon after taken prisoner by the advanced guards of the Scots, and carried before Douglas and Randolph. These leaders, confident in the strength of the position which they occupied, sent the squire back to his companions, with orders to lead the English army to the spot where they were encamped, adding, that Edward could not be more anxious to see them than they were to be confronted with him and his barons. Rokeby, who found the king with his army at Blanchland, on the river Derwent, informed them of his success ; and next morning, the army, drawn up in order of battle, hav ing marched, under the guidance of Rokeby, through Weardale, about mid-day came in sight of the Scots, strongly encamped on the slope of a hill, at the foot of which ran the rapid river Wear.2 The flanks of the position were defended by rocks, which it was impossible to turn, and which overhung the river so as to command its passage ; whilst the stream itself, full of huge stones, and swoln by the late rains, could not be passed without the greatest risk. Having halted and reconnoitred the position of the Scots, the English leaders considered it to be impregnable, and, in the chivalrous spirit of the times, heralds were sent with the proposal, that the two armies should draw up on the plain, renounce the advantages of ground, and decide the battle in a fair field. The Scottish leaders were too well experienced in war to be moved by this bravado. \" It is known,\" said they, in reply to the defiance, \" to the king and barons of England, that we are here in their kingdom, and have burnt and wasted 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol, iv. p. 312. 2 Barnes's Edward III. p. 12.

If displeased therewith, let them come and chastise us if they choose, for here we mean to remain as long as we please.\" x On the first sight of the strength of the Scottish position, the English leaders had given orders for the whole host to be drawn up on foot, in three great columns or battles, having commanded the knights and men-at-arms to lay aside their spurs, and join the ranks of the infantry. In this order the army conti nued for three days, vainly endeavouring, by man\u0153uvres and bravadoes, to compel the Scottish leaders to leave their strong ground, and accept their challenge. Every night the soldiers lay upon their arms, resting on the bare rocky ground ; and as they had no means of tying or picketing their horses, the cavalry were com pelled to snatch a brief interval of sleep with their reins in their hand, and harness on their back, desti tute of litter or forage, and without fuel to make fires for their comfort and refreshment. On the other hand, they had the mortification to be near enough to see and hear the merriment of the Scottish camp ; to observe that their enemies retired nightly to their huts, after duly stationing their watches; to see the whole hill blazing with the fires, round which they were cooking their victuals ; and to listen to the winding of the horns, with which the leaders called in the stragglers and pillaging parties. Although irritated and mortified with all this, the English absurdly determined to remain where they 1 Froissart, vol. i. p. 23. Hume erroneously describes Douglas as eagerly advising to risk a battle, and Moray dissuading him from it. He has also confounded this expedition with a subsequent inroad of Bruce into England, describing the attack upon Norham as having taken place previously to the encampment on the Wear. But the campaign of Randolph and Douglas, and the encampment at Stanhope Park, took place on 5th August, 1327. The siege of Norham did not com mence till September.

They had learnt from some prisoners, taken in skirmishing, that their enemies had neither bread nor wine ; and, to use the words of Froissart, it was the \"intention of the English to hold the Scots there in manner as besieged, thinking to have famished them.\" But a few hours' sufficed to show the folly of such a design. The third night had left the two armies as usual in sight of each other, the Scottish fires blaz ing, their horns resounding through the hills, aud their opponents lying under arms. In the morning, the English, instead of the gleam of arms, and the waving of the pennons of an encamped army, saw nothing before them but a bare hill-side.1 Their enemies, familiar with every part of this wild country, having found out a stronger position, had secretly decamped, and were soon discovered by the scouts in a wood called Stanhope Park, situated on a hill, at nearly the same distance from the river Wear as their first en campment.2 This ground had equal advantages, in commanding the river, with their first position ; and it was not only more difficult of access and of attack, but enabled them, under cover of the wood, to conceal their operations. Thus completely out-man\u0153uvred, and made aware on how frail a basis had been rested their project for starv ing out their enemy, the English army marched down the side of the Wear, and encamped on a hill fronting the Scots, and having the river still interposed between them. Fatigued and disheartened by their sufferings and reverses, they became remiss in their discipline ; and a daring night attack of Douglas had nearly put an end to the campaign, by the death or captivity of the young monarch of England.3 This leader, having 1 Froissart, vol. i. p. 25. 8 Barbour, pp. 394, 395. 3 Barnes's Edward III. p. 14.

ROBERT BRUCE. 359 discovered a ford at a considerable distance from both encampments, passed the river at midnight with five hundred horse ; with these he gained unperceived the rear of the English camp, and contrived to deceive the outposts by assuming the manner of an English officer going his rounds, and calling out, \" Ha, St George ! no watch ! \" He thus passed the barriers, and whilst one part of his men made an attack on a different quarter, Douglas and his party fell so fiercely and suddenly upon the enemy, that three hundred were slain in a few minutes ; still pressing on, and putting spurs to his horse, he penetrated to the royal tent, cut the tent ropes, and wrould have carried off the young monarch, but for the resistance of the royal household. The king's chaplain bravely defended his master, and was slain ; others followed his example, and shared his fate ; but the interval thus gained gave Edward time to escape, and roused the whole army, so that Douglas found it necessary to retreat. Blowing his horn, he charged through the thickening mass of his enemies, and, with inconsiderable loss, rejoined his friends. Disappointed of his prey, this veteran leader, on being asked by Randolph what speed they had made, replied, \" They had drawn blood, but that was all.\" 1 Provisions now began to fail in the Scottish camp, which had hitherto been plentifully supplied, and the two Scottish commanders consulted together what was best to be done. Randolph recommended the hazard ing a battle ; but Douglas, who, with all his keenness for fighting, was a great calculator of means, insisted that the disparity of force was too great, and proposed a retreat, which, from the nature of the ground, was nearly as dangerous as a battle. Behind the Scottish 1 Barbour, p. 399."], [368, "1327. 360 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. r camp was stretched a large morass, which was deemed impassable for cavalry, and which had effectually prevented any attack in their rear. In the front was the river Wear, the passage guarded by the English army, which outnumbered the Scots by forty thousand men ; and on each flank were steep and precipitous banks. To have attempted to break up their camp, and retreat in the day-time, in the face of so superior an enemy, must have been certain ruin. The Scottish leaders, accordingly, on the evening which they had chosen for their departure, lighted up their camp fires, and kept up a great noise of horns and shouting, as they had been wont to do. Meanwhile they had pre pared a number of hurdles, made of wands or boughs, tightly wattled together, and had packed up in the smallest compass their most valuable booty. At mid night they drew off from their encampment, leaving their fires burning ; and having dismounted on reaching the morass, they threw down the hurdles upon the softer places of the bog, and thus passed over the water-runs in safety, taking care to remove the hurdles so as to prevent pursuit by the enemy.1 It happened that, the day before, a Scottish knight had fallen into the hands of the English during a skir mish ; and being strictly questioned, he informed the king that the soldiers had received orders to hold themselves in readiness to follow the banner of Dou glas in the evening. Anticipating from this informa tion another night attack, the whole army drew up on foot, in three divisions, in order of battle ; and having given their horses in charge to the servants who re mained in the camp huts, lay all night under arms, expecting to be assaulted every moment. Night, how- Barbour, p. 402. Froissart, vol. i. p. 25."], [369, "1327. ROBERT BRUCE. 361 ever, passed away without any alarm ; and a little before daylight, two of the enemy's trumpeters were taken, who reported that the Scottish army had de camped at midnight, and were already advanced five miles on their way homewards. An instantaneous pursuit might still have placed the retreating army in circumstances of great jeopardy ; but the success of Douglas's night attack had made the English over cautious, and they continued under arms till broad daylight, suspecting some stratagem or ambush. At last, when, after a little time, nothing was seen, some scouts were sent across the river, who returned with the intelligence that the Scots had made good their retreat, and that their camp was entirely evacuated. The deserted encampment was then visited by their mortified opponents, and presented a singular spectacle. In it were found five hundred slaughtered cattle, -and more than three hundred caldrons, or kettles, which were made of skins of cattle with the hair on, suspended on stakes, and full of meat and water, ready for boil ing ; with about a thousand spit-racks, with meat on them ; and about ten thousand pairs of old shoes, commonly called brogues in Scotland, and made of raw hides, with the hair on the outer side. The only liv ing things found in the camp wTere five poor English men, stript naked and tied to trees. Three of these unfortunate men had their legs broken: a piece of savage cruelty, which, if committed with their know ledge, throws a deep stain upon Douglas and Randolph. On witnessing this, it is said that the young king, grievously disappointed at the mortifying result of an expedition commenced with such high hopes, and involving such mighty preparations, could not refrain from tears. In the meantime, the Scottish army, with safety and expedition, regained their own country in"], [370, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1327. 362 health and spirits, and enriched with the plunder of a three weeks' raid in England. Very different was the condition of the army of Edward. The noble band of foreign cavalry, consisting of knights and men-at arms from Hainault, Flanders, and Brabant, com manded by John of Hainault, were reduced, by the privation and fatigue of a mode of warfare with which they were little acquainted, to a state of much wretch edness.1 On reaching York, their horses had all died, or become unserviceable ; and the rest of the English cavalry were in an almost equal state of exhaustion and disorganization. The disastrous termination of this campaign very naturally inspired the English government with a desire of peace ; and although the blame connected with the retreat of the Scots, was attempted to be thrown upon the treachery of Mortimer, and a pro clamation issued from Stanhope Park, ridiculously described their enemies as having stolen away in the night, like vanquished men,2 the truth could not be concealed from the nation ; and every one felt that the military talents of Douglas and Randolph, and the patient discipline of the Scottish soldiers, rendered them infinitely superior to any English force which could be brought against them. The exhaustion of the English treasury, and the jealousy and heart burnings between Mortimer and the principal nobility, rendered it exceedingly improbable that a continuance of the war would lead to any better success ; and these desires for peace were not a little strengthened by the sudden appearance of the King of Scotland in person, who broke into England by the eastern borders at the head of an army, including every person in Scotland 1 F\u0153dera, vol. iv. p. 304. 2 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. iv. p. 301.

ROBERT BRUCE. 363 able to bear arms.1 Bruce himself sat down before Norham, with a part of his force ; a second division was commanded to waste Northumberland ; and a third, under Douglas and Randolph, laid siege to Alnwick castle; but before hostilities had proceeded to any length, commissioners from England were in the camp of the Scottish king, with a proposal for the marriage of Joanna, the Princess of England and sister to the king, to David, the only son of the King of Scots. It was required by the king, as the preliminary basis on which all future negotiation was to proceed, that Edward should renounce for ever all claim of feudal superiority which he and his predecessors had pre tended to possess over the kingdom of Scotland. To agree to this concession, appears to have been beyond the powers of the commissioners ; and a parliament was summoned for this purpose, a truce in the meantime having been agreed upon, during the continuance of the negotiations.2 At length, on the 1st of March, 1327-8, the English parliament assembled at York ; and this important preliminary, which had cost so great an expense of blood and treasure to both kingdoms, during a terrible war of twenty years, was finally and satisfactorily adjusted. Robert was acknowledged as King of Scotland, and Scotland itself recognized for ever as a free and independent kingdom. It was declared by Edward, in the solemn words of the instrument of renunciation, \" that whereas we, and others of our predecessors, Kings of England, have endeavoured to obtain a right of dominion and superiority over the kingdom of Scotland, and have 1 Barbour, p. 404. 2 The truce was to last from 23d Nov. till the 22d March, 1328.

And we hereby renounce and convey to the said King of Scotland, his heirs and successors, whatever right we, or our ancestors in times past, have laid claim to in any way over the kingdom of Scotland. And by these same presents, we renounce and declare void, for ourselves, and our heirs and suc cessors, all obligations, agreements, or treaties what soever, touching the subjection of the kingdom of Scotland, and the inhabitants thereof, entered into between our predecessors and any of the kings thereof, or their subjects, whether clergy or laity.

In testimony whereof, we have given these our letters-patent, at York, on the 1st of March, and in the second year of our reign : by the king himself, and his council in Parliament.\" x This important preliminary having been amicably settled, the English aud Scottish commissioners did not find it difficult to come to an arrangement upon the final treaty. Accordingly, peace with England was concluded at Edinburgh, on the 17th of March, 1327-8,2 and confirmed on the part of the English government, in a parliament held at Northampton, on the 4th of May, 1328. It was stipulated, that there should be a perpetual peace between the two kingdoms ; for confirmation of which, a marriage should take place between David, eldest son and heir of the King of Scotland, and Joanna, sister to the 1 There are three copies of this important deed known to our histo rians.

It is from this last, as published by Goodal, (Fordun, vol. ii. p. 289,) that I have taken the translation. 2 Carte, in an unsuccessful attempt to prove that this treaty did not receive the ratification of parliament, observes \u2014 \" If the parliament at York had assented to the treaty, why was that of Northampton summoned to warrant it by their assent and approbation?\" The answer is obvious. The parliament at York, on the 1st of March, agreed to the renunciation of the claim of superiority, but the remain ing articles of the treaty were yet unsettled. These were finally adjusted by the commissioners at Edinburgh, on the 17th of March ; and a parliament was summoned at Northampton, which gave its final approbation on the 4th of May.

In the event of Joanna's death before marriage, the King of England engaged to provide a suitable match for David from his nearest in blood ; and in the event of David's death previous to the marriage, the King of England, his heirs and successors, are to be permitted to marry the next heir to the throne of Scotland, either to Joanna, if allowable by the laws of the church, or to some other princess of the blood-royal of England. The two kings, with their heirs and successors, engaged to be good friends and faithful allies in assisting each other, always saving to the King of Scots the ancient alliance between him and the King of France ; and in the event of a rebellion against England in the king dom of Ireland, or against Scotland in Man, Skye, or the other islands, the two kings mutually agreed not to abet or assist their rebel subjects. All writings, obligations, instruments, or other muniments, relative to the subjection which the Kings of England had attempted to establish over the people and land of Scotland, and which are annulled by the letters-patent of the King of England, as well as all other instru ments and charters respecting the freedom of Scot land, as soon as they are found, were to be delivered up to the King of Scots ; and the King of England expressly engaged to give his assistance, in order that the processes of excommunication against Robert and his subjects, which had been carried through at the court of Rome, and elsewhere, should be recalled and annulled. It was, besides, agreed on the part of the king, the prelates, and the nobles of Scotland, that the sum of twenty thousand pounds sterling should, within three years, be paid, at three separate terms ; and in the event of failure, the parties were to submit themselves to the jurisdiction of the papal chamber."], [375, "1328.

The peace was termed igno minious, and the marriage a base alliance ; the treaty itself, in the framing of which the queen and Morti mer had a principal share,2 although undoubtedly ratified in parliament, was not generally promulgated, and does not appear amongst the national records and muniments of the time ; and when the renuncia tion of the superiority over Scotland, and the restora tion of the fatal stone, came to be publicly known, the populace in London rose in a riotous manner, and would not suffer that venerable emblem of the con quest of Edward the First to be removed.3 Yet 1 Hailes, vol. ii. p. 127.

Lingard, vol. iv. p. 9, following Lord Hailes, falls into the error of supposing that no copy of this treaty had been preserved by any writer, and doubts whether it was ever ratified by a full par liament. On what ground this doubt is founded, unless on the erro neous idea that no copy of the treaty could be discovered, it is difficult to imagine. He remarks, in a note, that a parliament was held at Northampton in April. It was at this parliament that the treaty of Northampton was agreed to. \" Donne a Northampton, le quart jour de May, Ian de nostre regue secont.\" What are we to think, then, of his concluding observation \u2014 \" but no important business was done, on account of the absence of the principal members ? \" 2 Edward's mother got a grant of 10,000 marks for herself.

To Bruce, on the other hand, the peace was in every respect a glorious one ; but it was wise and seasonable as well as glorious. Robert anxiously desired to settle his kingdom in tranquillity. Although not to be called an old man, the hardships of war had broken a constitution naturally of great strength, and had brought on a premature old age, attended with* a deep-seated and incurable disease, thought to be of the nature of leprosy. Upon his single life hung the prosperity of his kingdom, and the interests of his family. His daughter, the only child of his first marriage, was dead. During the negotiations for the treaty of Northampton, Elizabeth, his second wife, had followed her to the grave ;l his gallant brothers, partly on the scaffold, and partly on the field, had died without issue ; his only son was an infant, and his grandson, a boy of ten years old, who had lost both his parents. In these circumstances, peace was a signal blessing to the nation, and a joyful relief to himself. The complete independence of Scotland, for which the people of that land had obstinately sus tained a war of thirty-two years' duration, was at last amply acknowledged and established on the firmest basis ; and England, with her powerful fleets 1 She died 7th Nov. 1327.

ROBERT BRUCE. 369 and superb armies, her proud nobility, and her wealthy exchequer, was, by superior courage and military talent, compelled to renounce, for ever, her schemes of unjust aggression. In the conduct of this war, and in its glorious termination, Bruce stood alone, and shared the glory with no one. He had raised the spirit of his people to an ascendency over their enemies, which is acknowledged by the English his torians themselves ; and in all the great military transactions of the war, wTe can discern the presence of his inventive and presiding genius. He was, in deed, nobly assisted by Douglas and Randolph ; but it was he that had first marked their military talents, and it was under his eye that they had grown up into that maturity of excellence, which found nothing that could cope with them in the martial nobility of Eng land. Having thus accomplished the great object of his life, and warned by intimations w7hich could not be mistaken, that a mortal disease had fixed upon him, the king retired to his palace at Cardross, on the eastern shore of the Clyde. His amusements, in the intervals of disease, were kiugly, and his charities extensive. He built ships, an i recreated himself by sailing; he devoted himself to architecture and gar dening, improving his palace and orchard ; he kept a lion for his diversion, and, when his health permitted, delighted in hawking ; he entertained his nobility in a style of rude and abundant hospitality, and the poor received regular supplies by the king's order.1 Meanwhile the Princess Joanna of England, then in her seventh year, accompanied by the queen-dowager, the Earl of Mortimer, the Bishop of Lincoln high chancellor of England, and attended by a splendid 1 Chamberlain's Accounts, vol. i. pp. 38, 39, 40, 41, 46. VOL. I. 2 A"], [378, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1329. 370 retinue, began her journey to Scotland. At Berwick she was received by David her young bridegroom, then only five years of age. Randolph and Sir James Douglas, whom King Robert, detained by his increas ing illness, had sent as his representatives, accom panied the prince ; and the marriage was celebrated at Berwick with great joy and magnificence.1 The attendants of the princess brought along with them, to be delivered in terms of the treaty of Northampton, the Ragman Roll, containing the names of all those Scotsmen who had been compelled to pay homage to Edward the First, as well as other important records and muniments,2 which that monarch had carried with him from Scotland. Bruce was able to receive his son and his youthful consort with a warm and affectionate welcome at Edinburgh ; but, finding his disease in creasing upon him, he returned immediately to his rural seclusion at Cardross, where he died on the 7th June, 1329, at the age of fifty-five. Some time before his death, an interesting scene took place, which I shall give in the beautiful and affecting narrative of Froissart. \" In the meantime,\" says that historian, \" it hap pened that King Robert of Scotland was right sore aged and feeble, for he was grievously oppressed with the great sickness, so that there was no way with him but death ; and when he felt that his end drew near, he sent for such barons and lords of his realm as he most trusted, and very affectionately entreated and commanded them, on their fealty, that they should faithfully keep his kingdom for David his son, and when this prince came of age, that they should obey him, and place the crown on his head. After which, he called to him the brave and gentle knight Sir James Douglas, 1 Fordun a Hearne, vol. iv. p. 1016. Barbour, p. 407. 2 Carte, vol. ii. p. 397."], [379, "1329.

Never has my heart ceased to bend to this point ; but our Lord has not consented thereto ; for I have had my hands full in my days, and nowT, at the last, I am seized with this grievous sickness, so that, as you all see, I have nothing to do but to die. And since my body cannot go thither, and accomplish that which my heart hath so much desired, I have resolved to send my heart there, in place of my body, to fulfil my vow ; and now, since in all my realm I know not any knight more hardy than yourself, or more thoroughly furnished with all knightly qualities for the accomplishment of the vow ; in place of myself, therefore, I entreat thee, my dear and tried friend, that for the love you bear to me, you will undertake this voyage, and acquit my soul of its debt to my Saviour ; for I hold this opinion of your truth and nobleness, that whatever you undertake, I am persuaded you will successfully accomplish ; and thus shall I die in peace, provided that you do all that I shall tell you. I will, then, that as soon as I am dead, you take the heart out of my body, and cause it to be embalmed, and take as much of my treasure as seems to you sufficient for the expenses of your jour ney, both for you and your companions ; and that you carry my heart along with you, and deposit it in"], [380, "2f2 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1329. the holy sepulchre of our Lord, since this poor body cannot go thither. And it is my command, that you do use that royal state and maintenance in your jour ney, both for yourself and your companions, that into whatever lands or cities you may come, all may know that you have in charge, to bear beyond seas, the heart of King Robert of Scotland.' \" At these words, all who stood by began to weep ; and when Sir James himself was able to reply, he said, ' Ah ! most gentle and noble king, a thousand times do I thank you for the great honour you have done me, in making me the depositary and bearer of so great and precious a treasure. Most faithfully and willingly, to the best of my power, shall I obey your commands, albeit I would have you believe, that I think myself but little worthy to achieve so high an enterprise.' \u2014 'Ah! gentle knight,' said the king, ' I heartily thank you, provided you promise to do my bidding on the word of a true and loyal knight.' \u2014 ' Assuredly, my liege, I do promise so,' replied Doug las ; ' by the faith which I owe to God, and to the order of knighthood.' \u2014 'Now praise be to God,' said the king, ' for I shall die in peace, since I am assured that the best and most valiant knight of my kingdom has promised to achieve for me that which I myself could never accomplish.' And not long after, this noble king departed this life.\"1 At this, or some other interview, shortly before his death, Bruce delivered to the Scottish barons his last advice regarding the best mode of conducting the war against England. They concentrate, in a small com pass, the wisdom and experience which he had gained during the whole course of his protracted but glorious 1 Froissart, vol. i. pp. 28, 29.

In his -figure, the king was tall and well-shaped. Before broken down by illness, and in the prime of life, he stood nearly six feet high ; his hair curled closely and shortly round his neck, which possessed that breadth and thickness that belong to men of great strength ; he was broad-shouldered and open-chested, and the proportion of his limbs combined power with lightness and activity. These qualities were increased not only by his constant occupation in war, but by his fondness for the chase and all manly amusements. It is not known whether he was dark or fair complexioned ; but his forehead was low, his cheek-bones strong and prominent, and the general expression of his counte nance open and cheerful, although he was maimed by a wound which had injured his lower jaw. His man ners were dignified and engaging ; after battle, nothing could be pleasanter, or more courteous ; and it is infi nitely to his honour, that in a savage age, and smarting under injuries which attacked him in his kindest and"], [383, "1329. ROBERT BRUCE. 375 tenderest relations, he never abused a victory, but conquered often as effectually by his generosity and kindness, as by his great military talents. We know, however, from his interview with the papal legates, that when he chose to express displeasure, his look was stern and kingly, and at once imposed silence and insured obedience. He excelled in all the exercises of chivalry, to such a degree, indeed, that the English themselves did not scruple to account him the third best knight in Europe.1 His memory wTas stored with the romances of the period, in which he took great delight. Their hair-breadth 'scapes and perilous adventures were sometimes scarcely more wTonderful than his own ; and he had early imbibed from such works an appetite for individual enterprise and glory, which, had it not been checked by a stronger passion, the love of liberty, might have led him into fatal mis takes : it is quite conceivable, that Bruce, instead of a great king, might, like Richard the First, have be come only a kingly knight-errant. But from this error he was saved by the love of his country, directed by an admirable judgment, an un shaken perseverance, and a vein of strong good sense. It is here, although some may think it the homeliest, that we are to find assuredly the brightest part of the character of the king. It is these qualities which are especially conspicuous in his long war for the liberty of Scotland. They enabled him to follow out his plans through many a tedious year with undeviating energy ; to bear reverses, to calculate his means, to wait for his opportunities, and to concentrate his whole strength upon one great point, till it was gained and secured to his country for ever. Brilliant military talent and 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 295."], [384, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 376 1329. consummate bravery have often been found amongst men, and proved far more of a curse than a blessing ; but rarely, indeed, shall we discover them united to so excellent a judgment, controlled by such perfect disin terestedness, and employed for so sacred an end. There is but one instance on record where he seems to have thought more of himself than of his people,1 and even this, though rash, was heroic. By his first wife, Isabella, the daughter of Donald, tenth Earl of Mar, he had one daughter, Marjory. She married Walter, the hereditary High-steward of Scotland, and bore to him one son, Robert Stewart, afterwards king, under the title of Robert the Second. By his second wife, Elizabeth, the daughter of Richard de Burgh earl of Ulster, he had one son, David, who succeeded hini ; and two daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret. Immediately after the king's death, his heart was taken out, as he had himself directed. He was then buried with great state and solemnity under the pave ment of the choir, in the abbey church of Dunferm line, and over the grave was raised a rich marble monument, which was made at Paris.2 Centuries passed on ; the ancient church, with the marble monu ment, fell into ruins ; and a more modern building was erected on the same site. This, in our own days, gave way to time ; and in clearing the foundations for a third church, the workmen laid open a tomb which proved to be that of Robert the Bruce. The lead coating, in which the body was found enclosed, was twisted round the head into the shape of a rude crown. A rich cloth of gold, but much decayed, wTas thrown over it ; and, on examining the skeleton, it was found 1 See supra, p. 280. 2 Chamberlain's Accounts, vol. i. p. 101."], [385, "1329.

On the death of Bruce, Scotland, delivered from a long war by a treaty equally honourable and advan tageous, was yet placed in perilous circumstances. The character of Edward the Third had already begun to develop those great qualities, amongst which a talent for war, and a thirst for conquest and military renown were the most conspicuous. Compelled to observe the letter of the recent treaty of Northampton, this prince soon showed that he meant to infringe its spirit and disregard its sanctions, by every method of private intrigue and concealed hostility. With a greater regard for public opinion than his grandfather Edward the First, he was yet as thoroughly bent upon the aggrandisement of his dominions. Unwilling to bring upon himself the odium of an open breach of so recent and solemn a treaty, cemented as it was by a marriage between King David and his sister, Edward's policy was to induce the Scots themselves to infringe the peace by the private encouragement which he gave to their enemies, and then to come down with an over-"], [387, "1329. DAVID II. 379 whelming force and reduce the kingdom.1 Against these designs there were many circumstances which prevented .Scotland from making an effectual resis tance. Randolph wTas indeed nominated regent, and the talents of this great man in the arts of civil go vernment appear to have been as conspicuous as in war ; but he was now aged, and could not reasonably look to many more years of life. Douglas, whose genius for military affairs was, perhaps, higher than even that of Randolph, was soon to leave the kingdom on his expedition to the Holy Land ; and the powerful faction of the Comyns still viewed the line of Bruce with persevering enmity, and showed themselves ready to rise upon the first opportunity against the govern ment of his son. Nor was it long before this oppor tunity presented itself. Edward, the eldest son of John Baliol, had chiefly resided in France since his father's death ; but he now came to England, and, with the private connivance of Edward the Third, began to organize a scheme for the recovery of the Scottish crown. Dornagilla, the mother of Baliol, was sister in-law to the Red Comyn, whom King Robert Bruce had stabbed at Dumfries, so that the rights of the new claimant were immediately supported by the whole weight of the Comyns ; and, no longer awed by the commanding mind of Bruce, disputes and heart-burn ings arose amongst the Scottish nobility, at a time when a concentration of the whole strength of the nation was imperiously required. To return to the course of our narrative, Randolph, upon the death of Bruce, immediately assumed the 1 It is unfortunate that the Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, from which some of the most authentic and valuable materials for Scottish history are to be drawn, are wanting from the first year to the seventh of the reign of Edward the Third.

He was indefatigable in his application to business; and his justice was as bold and speedy as it was impartial. An instance of it has been preserved by Bower.1 A priest was slain : and the murderer, having gone to Rome and obtained the papal absolution, had the audacity to return openly to Scotland. He was seized and brought before Ran dolph, who was then holding his court at Inverness, during a progress through the country. He pleaded the absolution; but wTas tried, condemned, and instantly executed. The pope, it was remarked by the Regent Randolph, might absolve him from the spiritual con sequences of the sin, but it was nevertheless right that he should suffer for the crime committed against the law. Aware of the important influence of the local magistrates and judges, he made every sheriff responsible for the thefts committed within his juris diction ; so that, according to the simple illustrations of the chronicles of those times, the traveller might tie his horse to the inn-door, and the ploughman leave his ploughshare and harness in the field, without fear ; for if carried away, the price of the stolen article came out of the pocket of the sheriff. Anxious for the con tinuance of peace, Randolph sent Roger of Fawside on an amicable mission to the English king, whilst he took care at the same time to strengthen the borders, to repair the fortifications of the important town of Berwick, and commanded John Crab, the experienced Flemish mercenary, whom he retained in the pay of Scotland, to remain in that city, and keep a watch upon the motions of England.2 1 Forduni Scotichron. a Goodal, chap, xviii. book xiii. vol. ii. p. 297. 2 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 297.

He had wTith him seven noble Scottish knights, and was served at table by twrenty-eight squires of the first families in the country. \" He kept court,\" says Froissart, \"in a royal manner, with the sound of trumpets and cymbals; all the vessels for his table were of gold and silver ; and whatever persons of good estate went to pay their respects to him, were enter tained with the richest kinds of wine and spiced bread.2 At Sluys he heard that Alonzo, the King of Leon and Castile, was carrying on war with Osmyn, the Moorish governor of Granada. The religious mission which he had embraced, and the vows he had taken before leaving Scotland, induced Douglas to consider Alonzo's cause as a holy warfare ; and before proceeding to Jerusalem, he first determined to visit Spain, and to signalize his prowess against the Saracens. But his first field against the infidels proved fatal to him, who, in the long English war, had seen seventy battles.3 The circumstances of his death were striking and characteristic. In an action near Theba, on the borders of Andalusia, the Moorish cavalry were defeated ; and after their camp had been taken, Douglas, with his companions, engaged too 1 Rymer's F\u0153dera, vol. iv. p. 400. s Froissart, p. 117, vol. i.

The Scottish knight endeavoured to cut his way through the infidels; and in all probability would have succeeded, had he not again turned to rescue Sir William Sinclair of Roslin, whom he saw in jeopardy. In attempting this, he was inextricably involved with the enemy. Taking from his neck the casket which contained the heart of Bruce, he cast it before him, and exclaimed with a loud voice, \" Now pass onward as thou wert wont, and Douglas will follow thee or die!\"1 The action and the sentiment were heroic ; and they were the last words and deed of a heroic life, for Douglas fell, overpowered by his enemies ; and three of his knights, and many of his companions, were slain along with their master.2 On the succeeding day, the body and the casket were both found on the field, and by his surviving friends conveyed to Scotland. The heart of Bruce was deposited at Melrose, and the body of the \" Good Sir James,\" the name by which he is affectionately remembered by his countrymen, was consigned to the cemetery of his fathers in the parish church of Douglas.

He was gentle and amiable in society, and had an open and delightful expression in his countenance, which could hardly be believed by those who had only seen him in battle. His hair was black, and a little grizzled ; he was broad-shouldered, and somewhat large-boned ; but his limbs were cast in the mould of fair and just proportion. He lisped a little in his speech ; but this defect, far from giving the idea of effeminacy, became him well, when contrasted with his high and warlike bearing.1 These minute touches, descriptive of so great a man, were commu nicated by eye-witnesses to Barbour, the historian of Bruce. The Good Sir James was never married ; but he left a natural son, William Douglas, who inherited the military talents of his father, and with whom we shall soon meet, under the title of the Knight of Liddesdale. Soon after this disaster, which deprived Scotland of one of its best defenders, David, then in his eighth year, and his youthful queen, were crowned with the usual solemnities at Scone ; 2 on which occasion the royal boy, after having been himself knighted by Randolph the regent, surrounded by his barons and nobles, conferred knighthood on the Earl of Angus, Thomas earl of Moray, Randolph's eldest son, and others of his nobles.

The designs of Edward Baliol, and the dissembling con duct of Edward the Third, have been already alluded to ; and it unfortunately happened that there were circumstances in the present state of Scotland which gave encouragement to these schemes of ambition. During the wars of King Robert, many English barons who had been possessed of estates in that country, and not a few Scottish nobles who had treacherously leagued with England, were disinherited by Bruce, and the lands seized by the crown. By the treaty of Northampton, it was expressly provided that the Scottish estates of three of those English barons, Henry Percy, Thomas Lord Wake, and Henry Beau mont, should be restored. Percy was accordingly restored ; but, notwithstanding the repeated requisi tions of the English king, the Scottish regent delayed performance of the stipulations in favour of Wake and Beaumont ; and there were strong reasons, both in justice and expediency, for this delay.1 Wake claimed the lordship of Liddel, which wrould have given him an entrance into Scotland by the western marches ; while Beaumont, one of the most powerful barons in England, who, in right of his wife, claimed the lands and earldom of Buchan, might have excited distur bances, and facilitated the descent of an enemy upon the coast. These were not the only considerations which induced Randolph to suspend performance of would not alienate the crown lands, or any of the rents of the same ; and that whatever lands or revenues fell to the crown, should not be bestowed upon subjects without mature advice.

Henry de Beaumont and Lord Wake had violently opposed the whole treaty of Northampton, and declared themselves enemies to the peace with Scotland ; they had leagued with the disinherited Scottish barons, and had instigated Baliol to an invasion of that country, and an assertion of his claim to the crown. The English king, on the other hand, although speciously declaring his intention to respect that treaty,1 extended his protection to Edw7ard Baliol ; and when he was perfectly aware that a secret conspiracy for the invasion of Scotland was fostered in his court, of which Baliol, Wake, and Beaumont, were the principal movers, he yet prepos terously demanded of Randolph to restore Beaumont and Wake to their estates in that country.2 The power and opulence of Beaumont induced the whole body of the disinherited barons3 to combine their strength ; and aware that no effectual measures for suppressing their attempt wrould be used by Edward,4 they openly put themselves at the head of three hundred armed horse and a small body of in fantry, and declared their design of subverting the government of Bruce, and placing Baliol on the throne. It was their first intention to invade Scotland by the marches ; but to this the King of England would not consent : he allowed them, however, without any offer of opposition, to embark at Ravenshire, near the mouth of the Humber, with the design of making a descent on the coast, while, to preserve the appear- 1 Rymer, vol. iv. p. 4\"0. 2 Ibid. vol. iv. pp. 445, 452, 511, and 518. 3 Their names and titles are given by Leland, Collect, vol. i. pp. 552, 553.

Winton and Barbour, both historians of high credit, and the last almost a contemporary, assert that he came by his death in this foul manner, and that the poison was administered to him at a feast held at his palace of the Wemyss, by a friar who was suborned by the fac tion of Beaumont.3 It is certain, at least, that the friar took guilt to himself, by a precipitate flight to England. In the Earl of Moray Scotland lost the only man whose genius was equal to manage the affairs of the nation, under circumstances of peculiar peril and difficulty.

After great contention amongst the nobility, Donald earl of Mar, nephew to the late king, was chosen regent.1 This nobleman was in every way unfitted for so arduous a situation. When a child, he had been carried into England by Edward the First ; and on being released from captivity, had continued to reside in that country, and had even carried arms in the English army against Scotland. Although he was afterwards restored to his country, and employed by Bruce, it was in a subordinate mili tary command. The king appears to have considered his talent for war as of an inferior order ; and the re sult showred how well Bruce had judged.2 In the meantime, on the very day that the reins of the state fell into his feeble hand, word was brought that the fleet of Edward Baliol, and the disinherited barons, had appeared in the Forth. They landed soon after with their army at Wester-Kinghorn, where the ground was so unfavourable for the disembarking of cavalry, that a small force, led by any of the old cap tains of Bruce, would have destroyed the daring enterprise in its commencement. But Mar, who was at the bead of a Scottish army more than ten times the strength of the English, lingered at a distance, and lost the opportunity ; whilst Alexander Seton threw himself, with a handful of soldiers, upon the English, and was instantly overpowered and cut to pieces.3 Baliol immediately advanced to Dunferm line, where he found a seasonable supply for his small army, in five hundred spears and a quantity of pro visions, laid up there by the orders of Randolph, 1 Winton, vol. ii. p. 147.

On the oppo site bank lay the extensive tract called Dupplin Moor, upon which the Earl of Mar drew up his army, con sisting of thirty thousand men, excellently equipped, and commanded by the principal nobility of Scotland. Eight miles to the west of Forteviot, at Auchterarder, was the Earl of March, at the head of an army nearly as numerous, with which he had advanced through the Lothians and Stirlingshire, and threatened to at tack the English in flank. Nothing could be imagined more perilous than the situation of Baliol ; but he had friends in the Scot tish camps.3 Some of the nobility, whose relatives had suffered in the Black Parliament, were decided enemies to the line of Bruce, and secretly favoured the faction of the disinherited barons ; so that, by means of the information which they afforded him, he was enabled, with a force not exceeding three thousand men, to overwhelm the army of Mar at the moment that his own destruction appeared inevitable.4 1 Leland, Collect, vol. i. p. 553.

ROBERT BRUCE. 389 It is asserted by an English historian, on the au thority of an ancient manuscript chronicle, that the newly-elected regent had entered into a secret corre spondence with Baliol ; but the conduct of that ill fated nobleman appears to have been rather that of weakness and presumption than of treachery.1 Aware of the near presence of the enemy, he kept no watch, and permitted his soldiers to abandon themselves to riot and intemperance. Andrew Murray of Tullibar dine, a Scottish baron, who served in the army of March, basely conducted the English to a ford in the river, which he had marked by a large stake driven into its channel.2 Setting off silently at midnight, Baliol passed the river, and marching by Gask and Dupplin, suddenly broke in upon the outposts of the Scottish camp, and commenced a dreadful slaughter of their enemies, whom they mostly found drunken and heavy with sleep.3 The (Surprise, although un fortunate, was not at first completely fatal. Young Randolph earl of Moray, Murdoch earl of Menteith, Robert Bruce, a natural son of King Robert, and Alexander Fraser, hastily collected three hundred troops, and, with the desperate courage of men who felt that all hung upon gaining a few moments, checked the first onset, and drove back the English soldiers. This gave time for the main body of the Scots to arm ; and as the morning had now broke, the small num bers of the assailants became apparent. But the military incapacity of the regent destroyed the ad vantage which might have been improved, to the total discomfiture of Baliol. Rushing down at the head of his army, without order or discipline, the immense mass of soldiers became huddled and pressed together ; 1 Barnes's Hist, of Ed.

The rout now became total ; and the carnage, for it could not be called a battle, continued from early dawn till nine in the morning, by which time the whole of the Scottish army was slain, dispersed, or taken pri soners. So rapid and easy had been the victory, that the English ascribed it to a miraculous interference for their preservation, and the Scots to a sudden infliction of divine vengeance. But the military incapacity of Mar, and the treachery of Murray, sufficiently account for the disaster. On examining the field, it was found that multi tudes had perished without stroke of weapon, over ridden by their own cavalry, suffocated by the pressure and weight of their armour, or trod under foot by the fury with which the rear ranks had pressed upon the front.2 On one part of the ground the dead bodies lay so thick, that the mass of the slain was a spear's length in depth.3 It is difficult to estimate the num ber of those who fell ; but amongst them were some of the bravest of the Scottish nobility. The young Randolph earl of Moray, whose conduct that day had been worthy of his great father; Robert earl of Carrick, a natural son of King Edward Bruce; Alexander Fraser chamberlain of Scotland, who had married the sister of the late king ; Murdoch earl of Menteith, 1 Winton, vol. ii. pp. 152, 153. a Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 305. 3 Winton, vol. ii. p. 155.

In addition to these, there fell many Scottish knights, and men-at-arms, and probably not less than thirteen thousand infantry and camp followers.1 Duncan earl of Fife was made prisoner, after a brave resistance, in which three hundred and sixty men-at-arms, who fought under his banner, were slain. Of the English the loss was inconsiderable : besides those of less note, it included only two knights and thirty-three esquires, a disparity in the numbers, wmich, although very great, is not without parallel in history.2 There does not occur in our Scottish annals a greater or more calamitous defeat than the rout at Dupplin, even when stripped of the additions of some English histo rians.3 It wTas disgraceful, too, as its cause is to be found in the military incapacity of Mar the leader, and in the acknowledged treachery of one, and probably of more than one, of the Scottish barons. The principal of these, Murray of Tullibardine, was speedily over taken by the punishment which he deserved : he was made prisoner at Perth, tried, condemned, and exe cuted.4 After the battle of Dupplin, Baliol instantly pressed forward and took possession of Perth, which he forti fied by palisades, with the intention of abiding there the assault of the enemy, for the Earl of March was still at the head of a powerful army of thirty thousand men. March was a baron of great landed power, but lightly esteemed by all parties;5 timid, and intent upon his own interest ; unwilling to peril his great estates by an adherence to the losing side ; and pos- 1 Walsingham, p. 131.

Upon hearing the account of the defeat at Dupplin, he passed with his army over the field of battle, which presented a ghastly confirmation of the tale ; and on reaching Lammerkin Wood, commanded the soldiers to cut fagots and branches to be used in filling up the fosse, should they assault Perth, against which town he now advanced. The near approach of so great an army alarmed the citizens, who began to barricade the streets and the approach to their houses. But on reaching the high ground immediately above the town, March com manded his men to halt. Beaumont, wTho intently watched his operations, observing this, called out \" to take courage, for he knew they had friends in that army, and need fear no assault.\" 1 It is probable that, in the halt made by March, Beaumont recog nized a sign of his friendly intentions, which had been previously agreed on. It is probable, at least, that this powerful baron himself, and certain that some of his leaders, had engaged in a correspondence with Baliol ; as the intended assault was delayed, and the protracted measure of a blockade preferred ; a change which, in the mutual situation of the two parties, can be accounted for on no ground but that of a friendly feeling to Baliol. At this moment, Crab, the Flemish mercenary, appeared with his fleet in the Tay, and attacked the English ships. He was at first success- ful, and made a prize of the Beaumondscogge, Henry de Beaumont's vessel ; but the rest of the squadron defended themselves with such resolution, that in the end Crab was defeated, and compelled to fly to Ber- wick.2 This disaster gave March a plausible pretext 1 Winton, vol. ii. p. 156.

The blockade was changed into a retrograde movement, which soon after ended in the total dispersion of the Scottish army, and, after a decent interval, in the accession of the Earl of March to the English interest.1 Baliol, secure from all opposition for the present, now repaired to Scone ; and in the presence of many of the gentry from Fife, Gowry, and Strathern, was crowned King of Scotland.2 Duncan earl of Fife, who had joined the English party, and Sinclair bishop of Dunkeld, officiated at the solemnity. The chief causes which led to this remarkable revo lution, destined for a short time to overthrow. the dynasty of Bruce, are not difficult of discovery. The concluding part of the late king's reign, owing to the severity with wrhich he punished the conspiracy of Brechin, had been unpopular ; and part of the discon tented nobility were not slow in turning their eyes Reginald More chamberlain of Scotland, who sold it to the king for two hundred pounds. Chamberlain's Accounts, p. 256. 1 Lord Hailes, Ann. vol. ii. p. 155, in a note, exculpates March, and softens his accession to the English lords. He tries to show that March raised the leaguer of Perth, not from treachery but necessity. It is evident that much of the question, as to March's treachery, and that of the \" noble persons \" who acted along with him, hangs on Beau mont's speech. Now, Hailes has curtailed it. Beaumont really said, \" Take courage ; for that army, as I conjecture, will not hurt us ; because I perceive, without doubt, our friends and well-wishers amongst them.\" The author of the Annals makes him say, \" Take courage ; these men will not hurt us ;\" and he then observes, \" Whether he said this merely to animate the English, or whether he formed his conjec ture from the disordered motions of the enemy, or whether he indeed discerned the banners of some noble persons, who secretly favoured Baliol, is uncertain.\" Now there is really no uncertainty about the speech. Beaumont, in the part of the passage which Hailes has over looked, expressly affirmed that he perceived friends in March's army. Had he consulted Winton, he would have found that this old and authentic chronicler, vol. ii. p. 156, makes Beaumont say, \" Look that ye be Merry and glad, and have no doubt, For we have friends in yon rout.\" ' Winton, vol. ii. p. 157."], [402, "39J, HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1332. from the line of Bruce, which his great energy and military talents had compelled them to respect, to the claims of Baliol, weak in personal power, but, as they imagined, better supported in right and justice. A party of English barons, headed by Henry Beaumont, one of the most influential subjects in England, having been dispossessed by Bruce of their estates in Scot land, determined to recover them by the sword, and united themselves with Baliol; concealing their private ambition under the cloak of re-establishing the right ful heir upon the throne. They were mostly men of great power, and were all of them more or less con nected with the numerous sept of the Comyns, the inveterate enemies of Bruce. They received private encouragement and support from the King of England, and they began their enterprise when the civil govern ment in Scotland, and the leading of its armies, was in the hands of Mar and(March : the first a person of no talents or energy, and suspected of being inclined to betray his trust ; the second undoubtedly a favourer of the English party. There was nothing, therefore, extraordinary in the temporary recovery of the crown by Baliol; but a short time showed him how little dependence was to be placed on such a possession. The friends of the line of Bruce were still numerous in the country: amongst them were the oldest and most experienced soldiers in Scotland ; and the feelings of the nation were en tirely on their side. Their first step was a decided one. Anxious for the safety of the young king, then a boy in his ninth year, they sent him and his youth ful queen with speed to the court of France, where they were honourably and affectionately received by Philip the Sixth.1 1 Winton, vol. ii. p. 158.

DAVID H. 395 Perth had been fortified by the disinherited lords ; after which Baliol made a progress to the southern parts of Scotland, and committed the custody of the town to the Earl of Fife. It was soon after attacked and stormed by Sir Simon Fraser and Sir Robert Keith, who destroyed the fortifications, and took the constable, Fife, and his daughter prisoners. Upon this first gleam of success, Sir Andrew Moray of Bothwell, who had married Christian, the sister of the late king, was chosen regent. Meanwhile Baliol, with ready pusillanimity, hastened to surrender to Edward the liberties of Scotland ; and the English king moved on to the borders, with the declared purpose of attending to the safety of that divided country. The transac tions which followed at Roxburgh throw a strong light upon the characters of both sovereigns. After his many hypocritical declarations as to the observation of the treaty of Northampton, the Eng lish king now dropt the mask, and declared, that the successes of Baliol in Scotland were procured by the assistance of his good subjects, and with his express permission or sufferance.1 In return for this assis tance, Baliol acknowledged Edward as his feudal lord, and promised that he would be true aud loyal to the English king and to his heirs, the rightful sovereigns of the kingdom of Scotland. In addition to this, he agreed to put Edward in possession of the town, castle, and territory of Berwick, and of other lands upon the marches, extending to the value of two thousand pounds ; and affecting to consider the Princess Joanna of England as only betrothed to King David Bruce, he proposed himself as a more convenient match, and offered to provide for David Bruce in whatever way 1 Rymer's F\u0153dera, vol. iv. p. 538.

He lastly promised to assist the English king, in all his wars, with two hundred men-at-arms, maintained at his own charges ; and he engaged that his successors should furnish a hundred men-at-arms, for the same service. The penalty affixed to the breach of this agreement, was a fatal part of the treaty. If Baliol, or his successors, neglected to appear in the field, they became obliged to pay to England the enormous sum of two hundred thousand pounds sterling ; and if this money could not be raised, it was agreed that Edward should take possession of the \" remainder of Scotland and the isles.\" This last obligation, which was to be per petually in force, evidently gave Edward the power of draining Scotland of its best soldiers, and in the event of resistance, of at once seizing and appropriating the kingdom.1 Thus, in a moment of sordid selfishness, were the chains, which had cost Robert Bruce thirty years' war to break, again attempted to be fixed upon a free country, and this by the degenerate hands of one of her own children. But Baliol's hour of prosperity was exceeding brief. Strong, as he imagined, in the pro tection of the King of England, and encouraged in his security by the readiness with which many of the Scottish barons had consented to recognize his title,2 the new king lay carelessly encamped at Annan, not aware of the approach of a body of armed horse, under the command of the Earl of Moray, the second son of the great Randolph, along with Sir Simon Fraser and Archibald Douglas, brother to Bruce's old companion in arms, the good Sir James. These barons, informed of the new king's remissness in his discipline, made a 1 F\u0153dera, vol. iv. pp. 536 and 548. 5 Fordun a Hearne, pp. 1020, 1021. Winton, vol. ii. p. 159."], [405, "1332.

Taken completely by surprise, the nobles who were with him, aud their vassals and retainers, were put to the sword without mercy. Henry Baliol, his brother, after a gallant resistance, was slain ; and Walter Comyn, Sir John de Mowbray, and Sir Richard Kirby, met their deaths along with him. Alexander earl of Carrick was made prisoner; and Baliol, in fear of his life, and almost naked, threw himself upon a horse, and with difficulty escaped into England.1 Carrick, the natural son of King Edward Bruce, would have been executed as a traitor, but young Randolph interfered and saved his life. With the assistance of strangers and mercenary troops, it had cost Baliol only seven weeks to gain a crown : in less than three months it was torn from his brow, he himself chased from Scotland, and cast once more a fugitive and an exile upon the charity of England.2 Encouraged by this success, and incensed at the assistance given by Edward to Baliol and the disin herited lords, the Scottish leaders began to retaliate by breaking in upon the English borders. It is a singular instance of diplomatic effrontery, that the English king, on hearing of this invasion, accused the Scots of having violated the treaty of Northampton : 3 in his correspondence with the King of France and the court of Rome, he does not hesitate to cast upon that nation the whole blame of the recommencement of the war ; 4 and as if this was not enough, the English 1 Winton, vol. ii. p. 161.

Both the one and the other assertion appear to be unfounded. 1 Hostilities having again broke out between the two nations, the border inroads recommenced with their accustomed fury ; but at first were attended with cir cumstances disastrous for Scotland. It happened that Baliol, after his flight from Annan, had experienced the Christmas hospitality of Lord Dacres ; in return for which kindness, Archibald Douglas, at the head of a small army of three thousand men, broke in upon Gillsland, and wasted the country belonging to Dacres with fire and sword, spreading desolation for a distance of thirty miles, and carrying off much booty. To revenge this, Sir Anthony Lucy of Cockermouth, and William of Lochmaben, with eight hundred men, penetrated into Scotland; but on their return were encountered by Sir William Douglas, commonly called the Knight of Liddesdale, and at that time keeper of Lochmaben castle. After a conflict, in which Lucy was grievously wounded, Douglas was totally defeated. Of the Scots, a hundred and sixty men-at-arms, in cluding Sir Humphrey Jardine, Sir Humphrey Boys, and William Carlisle, were left on the field, and the best of the chivalry of Annandale were either slain or made captive.2 Amongst the prisoners were Douglas especial care, in his correspondence with Rome, to keep the pope ignorant of the real state of Scottish affairs ; and the cause of this sedulous concealment was the dread of being subjected in the payment of two thousand pounds, the stipulated fine in case he infringed the treaty.

So anxious was Edward to secure the prize he had won in the Knight of Liddesdale, a natural son of the Good Sir James, wdio inherited his father's remarkable talents for war, that he issued orders for his strict confinement in iron fetters ; J and Baliol having, a short time before this success, again entered Scotland, and established himself in the castle of Roxburgh, endea voured to confirm his authority in Annandale, by bestowing the lands of the knights who were slain upon his English followers.2 Another disaster followed hard upon the defeat of Douglas at Lochmaben. The regent, Sir Andrew Moray, with a strong body of soldiers, attacked and attempted to storm the castle of Roxburgh, where Baliol then lay. A severe conflict took place on the bridge ; and in the onset, Ralph Golding, an esquire in the regent's service, pushing on far before the rest, was overpowered by the English. Moray, in the ardour of the moment, more mindful of his duty as a knight than a leader, attempted singly to rescue him, and instantly shared his fate.3 Disdaining to sur render to any inferior knight, he demanded to be led to the King of England ; and being brought to Ed ward, was throwm into prison, where he remained for two years. The Scots, who at their greatest need had lost in Douglas and Moray two of their best sol diers, endeavoured to supply their place by conferring the office of regent upon Archibald Douglas lord of Galloway, the brother of the Good Sir James.4 1 Rymer's F\u0153dera, vol. iv. p. 552. 2 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, 8 Edward III. 18 Nov. vol. i. p. 294. 3 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. pp. 309, 310. * Ibid. p. 310."], [408, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1333. 400 In consequence of these advantages, Edward deter mined to carry on the war with renewed spirit. He assembled a powerful army, besought the prayers of the church for his success, and wrote to the Earl of Flanders, and to the magistrates of Bruges, Ghent, and Ypres, requesting them to abstain from rendering assistance to the Scots.1 He informed the King of France, who had interposed his good offices in behalf of his ancient allies, that, as they had repeatedly broken the peace, by invading and despoiling his country, he was necessitated to repel such outrages by force of arms ;2 and having taken these preliminary steps, he put himself at the head of his army, and sat down before Berwick. The Scots, on their side, were not unprepared to receive him. Although Crab's disaster in the former year had weakened their strength by sea, they still possessed a fleet of ships of war, which committed great havock on the English coasts, and plundered their sea-ports ; 3 and Douglas the regent exerted himself to raise an army equal to the emergency. The defence of the castle of Berwick was imprudently committed to the Earl of March, whose conduct, after the battle of Dupplin, had evinced already the strongest leaning to the English interest : the command of the town was intrusted to Sir Alexander Seton.4 The garrison appears neither to have been numerous nor wrell sup plied ; but for some time they made a gallant defence, and succeeded in sinking and destroying by fire a great part of the English fleet.

After a protracted blockade, a negotiation took place, by which the besieged agreed to capitulate by a certain day, unless succours were thrown into the town before that time ; and for the performance of the stipulations the Scots delivered hostages to Edward, amongst whom wras a son of Seton the governor.1 The period had nearly expired, when, one morning at the break of day, the citizens, to their great joy, saw the army of Scotland, led by the regent in person, approach the Tweed, and cross the river at the Yare ford. They approached Ber wick on the south side of the river ; and although the English endeavoured to defend every passage, Sir AYilliam Keith, Sir William Prendergest, and Sir Alexander Gray, with a body of Scottish soldiers, succeeded in throwing themselves into the towm. The main body of the Scots, after having remained drawm up in order of battle, and in sight of the English army, for a day and a half, struck their tents at noon of the second day, and, with the hope of producing a diversion, entered Northumberland, and wasted the country. But although they menaced Bamborough castle, where Edward had placed his young queen, that monarch, intent upon his object, continued before Berwick, and, on the departure of the Scottish army, peremptorily required the town to be given up, as the term stipulated for their being succoured had expired. With this demand the besieged refused to comply : 1 Scala Chron. pp. 162, 163 ; and Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. p. 272. Compot. Camerarii Scoti\u00e6, p. 255. VOL.

It was their opinion that the Scots had broken the stipulations of the treaty, and that their lives were forfeited. The king then commanded the son of the late governor to prepare for death, expecting that the threatened severity of the example, and the rank and influence of his father, would induce the townsmen to surrender. But he was disappointed ; and Thomas Seton, a comely and noble-looking youth, was hanged before the gate of the town,2 so near, it is said, that the unhappy father could witness the execution from the walls.3 Immediately after this, the citizens became alarmed for the lives of the rest of the host ages ; and from affection for their children, renewed the negotiations for surrender, unless succoured before a certain day. To this resolution Keith their gover nor encouraged them, by holding out the sure hope of the siege being raised by the Scottish army, which he represented as superior to that of England.4 Unhap- 1 Scala Chron. pp. 163, 164. 2 Fordun a Hearne, vol. iv. p. 1022. 3 See Illustrations, letters FF. 4 Scala Chron. in Hailes, pp. 163, 164.

Neither Fordun, nor his continuator Bower, nor Win ton, say any thing of the town having been set on fire. The English"], [411, "1333. DAVID II. 403 pily they embraced his advice. It was stipulated, in a solemn instrument yet preserved, and with a minute ness which should leave no room for a second misun derstanding, that Berwick was to be given up to the English, unless the Scots, before or on the 19th of July, should succeed in throwing two hundred men at-arms into the town by dry land, or should overcome the English army in a pitched field.1 Keith, the governor of the town, was permitted, by the treaty of capitulation, to have an interview with the regent, Archibald Douglas. He represented the desperate situation of the citizens ; magnified the importance of the town, which must be lost, he said, unless immediately relieved ; and persuaded the regent to risk a battle. The resolution was the most impru dent that could have been adopted. It was contrary to the dying injunctions of Bruce, who had recom mended his captains never to hazard a battle if they could protract the war, and lay waste the country ; and especially so at this moment, as desertion and mutiny now began to show themselves in the English army, which all the endeavours of Edward had not been able to suppress.2 Notice, too, had reached the camp of illegal meetings and confederations having taken place in London during the king's absence, and the people of the northern shires had peremptorily refused to join the army; so that there was every probability that it must soon have been disbanded.3 It was in expectation of this result, Seton, the for mer governor, had determined to hold out the town to historians, Walsingham and Hemingford, indeed, assert it ; but it is not to be found in the narrative of the Scala Chronicle, which appears to be the most authentic ; I have therefore omitted it. 1 F\u0153dera, vol. iv. pp. 566, 567. 2 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, 7 Edward III. m. 26, dor30, vol. i. p. 235. 3 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. pp. 234, 244."], [412, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 404 1333. the last extremity, and sternly refused to capitulate, although the life of his son hung upon the issue. But his resolution was counteracted by the rashness of Keith, the new governor of the town, as well as by the excusable affection of the citizens for their sons, who were hostages. The regent suffered himself to be over ruled ; and on the day before the festival of the Virgin, being the 18th of July, the Scottish army crossed the Tw7eed, and encamped at a place called Dunsepark. Upon this, Edward Baliol and the King of England drew up their forces on the eminence of Halidon Hill, situated to the wrest of the town of Berwick. Nothing could be more advantageous than the position of the English. They were divided into four great battles, each of which was flanked by choice bodies of archers. A marsh separated the hill on which they stood from the opposite eminence, and on this rising ground the Scottish commanders halted and arranged their army.1 It consisted also of four divisions, led respectively by the Regent Douglas ; the Steward of Scotland, then a youth of seventeen, under the direction of his uncle Sir James Stewart ; the Earl of Moray, son of Ran dolph, assisted by two veteran leaders of approved valour, James and Simon Fraser ; and the Earl of Ross. The nature of the ground rendered it impos sible for the English position to be attacked by cavalry. Their adversaries accordingly fought on foot, and the leaders and heavy-armed knights having dismounted, delivered their horses to be kept by the camp-boys in the rear. Before reaching their enemy, it was neces- 1 I take this from an interesting and curious manuscript preserved in the British Museum, Bib.

Yet, contrary to the advice of the elder officers, who had been trained under Bruce and Randolph, this desperate attempt was made ; and the Scots, with their characteristic im petuosity, eagerly advanced through the marsh. The consequence was what might have been expected: their ranks, crowded together, soon fell into confusion ; their advance was retarded ; and the English archers, who had time for a steady aim, plied their bows wTith such deadly effect, that great numbers were every instant slain or disabled. An ancient manuscript says, that the arrows flew as thick as motes in the sunbeam, and that their enemies fell to the ground by thousands.1 It could not indeed be otherwise ; for, from the nature of the ground, it wras impossible to come to close fighting; and having no archers, they were slaughtered without resistance \u2014 the English remaining in the meantime uninjured, writh their trumpets and nakers sounding amid the groans of their dying opponents. Upon this dreadful carnage, many of the Scots began to fly ; but the better part of the army, led on by the nobility, at last extricated themselves from the marsh, and, press ing up the hill, attacked the enemy with great fury. It was difficult, howTever, for men, breathless by climb ing the acclivity, and dispirited by the loss sustained in the marsh, to contend against fresh troops, admir ably posted, and under excellent discipline ; so that, although they for a little time fiercely sustained the 1 MS.

The Earl of Ross, in leading the reserve to attack the wing where Baliol commanded, was driven back and slain. Soon after, the Regent Douglas was mor tally wounded and made prisoner. The Earls of Lennox, Athole, Carrick, and Sutherland, along with James and Simon Fraser, were struck down and killed; while the English, advancing in firm array with their long spears, entirely broke and drove off the field the remains of the Scottish army. In the pursuit which succeeded, the carnage was great. Besides the nobles and barons already mentioned, John Stewart and James Stewart, uncles of the Steward of Scotland, were mor tally wounded. Malise earl of Strathern, John de Graham, Alexander de Lindesay, and other barons, were also slain ; and with them fell, on the lowest calculation, fourteen thousand men. Such was the disastrous defeat of the Scots at Halidon Hill.1 The battle was fought on the 20th day of July ; and the English monarch immediately addressed letters to the archbishops and bishops of his dominions, directing them to return thanks to God for so signal a victory.2 In the conflicting accounts of the various annalists, 1 Winton, vol. ii. p. 170.

It is observed by Edward, in his letters ordaining a public thanksgiving, that the victory was obtained without great loss upon his side ; an expression proving the inaccuracy of the asser tion of the English historians, that of their army only thirteen foot soldiers, with one knight and one esquire, were slain. Nor is it un worthy of remark, that the king makes no allusion to any inferiority of force upon the English side ; which, had such been the case, he could scarcely have failed to do, if we consider the subject of his letter.

DAVID II. 407 the exact number of the two armies, and the extent of the loss on either side, cannot be easily ascertained. It seems probable, that nearly the whole of the men at-arms in the Scottish ranks were put to the sword either in the battle or in the pursuit ; and that of the confused multitude wmich escaped, the greater part were pages, sutlers, and camp-followers. So great was the slaughter of the nobility, that after the battle, it was currently said amongst the English, that the Scot tish wars were at last ended, since not a man was left of that nation who had either skill or power to assem ble an army or direct its operations.1 The consequences of the battle of Halidon were the immediate delivery of the towm and castle of Berwick into the hands of the English, and the subsequent submission of almost the whole kingdom to Baliol, who traversed it with an army which found no enemy to oppose it.2 Five strong castles, however, still re mained in possession of the adherents of David, and these eventually served as so many rallying points to the friends of liberty. These fortresses were Dunbar ton, which wTas held by Malcolm Fleming ; Urquhart, in Inverness-shire, commanded by Thomas Lauder ; Lochleven, by Alan de Vipont ; Kildrummie, by Christian Bruce, the sister of Robert the First ; and Lochmaben, by Patrick de Chartres.3 A stronghold in Lochdon, on the borders of Carrick, was also re tained for David Bruce by John Thomson, a brave soldier of fortune, and probably the same person who, after the fatal battle of Dundalk, led home from Ire land the broken remains of the army of King Edward Bruce.4 1 Murimuth, p. 81.

Baliol accordingly appeared before Edward at Newcastle, acknowledged him for his liege lord, and swore fealty for the kingdom of Scotland and the Isles. Edward, thus rendered master of the fairest and most populous part of Scotland, hastened to send English governors to his new dominions ;x while the friends of the young king once more retired into the mountains and fastnesses, and waited for a favourable opportunity of rising against their oppressors. Nor was it long ere an occasion presented itself. Dissensions broke out amongst those English barons to whose valour Baliol owed his restoration ; and a petty family quarrel gave rise to an important counter-revolution. The brother of Alexander de Mowbray died, leaving daughters, but no male heirs ; upon which Mowbray claimed the estate, in exclusion of the heirs-female, and, by a decision of Baliol, was put in possession : 2 an award the more extraordinary, as it went to destroy his own title to the crown. The cause of the disin herited daughters was warmly espoused by Henry de Beaumont, Richard Talbot, and the Earl of Athole, all of them connected by marriage wdth the powerful family of the Comyns ; and, upon the denial of their suit by Baliol, these fierce barons retired in disgust from court. Beaumont, taking the law into his own hands, retreated to his strong castle of Dundarg in Buchan, and seized a large portion of the disputed lands which lay in that earldom. Athole removed to his strongholds in the country of Athole ; and Talbot, who had married the daughter of the Red Comyn 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. p. 263. 5 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 312.

At the same time, some Scottish ships of war, assisted by a fleet of their allies, laden with provisions and arms, and well manned with soldiers, hovered on the coast, and threatened to intercept the English vessels which had been sent by Edward with supplies for his adherents.3 Baliol in the meantime, irresolute and alarmed, retreated to Berwick, and reversed his decision in favour of Mowbray. But this step came too late to conciliate Beaumont ; and it entirely alienated Mowbray, who, eager to embrace any method of humbling his rivals, went over with his friends and vassals to the party of David Bruce, and cordially co-operated with Moray, the late regent.

This, however, was no easy enterprise. Situated on a precipitous rock overhang ing the Moray Firth, the strong retreat which the English baron had chosen was connected with the mainland by a neck of land so narrow, that a few re solute men could defend it against a multitude. To attempt to storm it would have been certain defeat ; and Moray chose rather, by a strict blockade, to compel a surrender. An unexpected circumstance accelerated his success. Having discovered the situa tion of the pipes which supplied the garrison with water, he mined the ground, cut them through, and reduced the besieged to extremity. Beaumont capi tulated ; and, upon payment of a high ransom, was permitted to retire into England.1 Amongst the numerous confiscations which followed his brief possession of power, Baliol had conferred the extensive possessions of Robert the Steward of Scot land upon the Earl of Athole ; while this young baron, stript of his lands, and compelled to be a wan derer, had lain concealed in Bute since the defeat at Halidon Hill, and escaped the search of his enemies. With a prudence and determination superior to his years, he now organized a plan for escaping to the castle of Dunbarton, in which he happily succeeded. Two old vassals of the family, named Gibson and Heriot, brought a boat to Rothesay late in the even ing, and the Steward, accompanied only by a chamber boy and two servants, threw himself into it, and rowed that night to Overtunnock, from which they crossed to Dunbarton, where they were joyfully wel- 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 312.

The news of this success soon flew to Bute ; and there the hereditary vassals of the young patriot in stantly rose upon the English governor, Alan de Lyle, put him to death, and proceeded, carrying his head in savage triumph along with them, to join their master. The castle of Bute soon after fell into the hands of the insurgents.2 The country of Annandale, as we have already stated, was presented by Baliol to Henry Percy ; but its mountains and fastnesses had given refuge to many brave men who obstinately refused to submit to the English king. On the first intelligence that the Steward had displayed open banner against the Eng lish, these fugitives, says an ancient historian, came suddenly, like a sw7arm of hornets, from the rocks and woods, and wrarred against the common enemy. The chief amongst them wTas William de Carruthers, who, since the success of Baliol, had preferred a life of extremity and hardship, as a fugitive in the woods, to the ignominy of acknowledging a yoke he detested.

Strengthened by such accessions, the Steward in a short time reduced the lower division of Clydesdale ; compelled the English governor of Ayr to acknowledge King David Brace ; and expelled the adherents of Baliol and Edward from the districts of Renfrew, Carrick, and Cunningham. The Scottish nobles of his party now assembled, and preferred this young patriot and the Earl of Moray to the office of joint regents under their exiled king. The choice was in every respect judicious. The Steward, although now only in his nineteenth year, had early shown great talents for wTar ; he was the grandson of Robert the First, and had been al ready declared by parliament the next heir to the crown : Moray, on the other hand, was the son of the great Randolph ; so that the names of the new gover nors were associated with the most heroic period of Scottish history : a circumstance of no trivial impor tance at a period when the liberties of the country were threatened with an utter overthrow. About the same time, the friends of liberty were cheered by the arrival of a large vessel laden with arms, besides wines and merchandise, in the port of Dunbarton ; a circumstance which Edward considered of so much importance, that he directed his writs to the magis trates of Bristol and Liverpool, commanding them to fit out some ships of war to intercept her on her return.1 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. p. 320."], [423, "1334.

Thus, by the overthrow of Beau mont, Talbot, and Athole, the most powerful branch in the confederacy of the disinherited barons was entirely destroyed ; and Baliol, once more a fugitive, passed into England, and implored the protection and assistance of Edward. On being informed of the revolution in Scotland, this monarch, although it was now the middle of November, determined upon a winter campaign, and issued writs for the attendance of his military vassals. The expedition, however, proved so unpopular, that fifty-seven of the barous who owed suit and service, absented themselves ; 2 and, with an army enfeebled by desertion, Edw7ard made his progress into Lothian, where, without meeting an enemy, if wre except some obscure malefactors wdio were taken and executed, he ruled over a country which the Scots, following the advice of Bruce, abandoned for the time to his undis turbed dominion.3 Baliol, as usual, accompanied Edward, and with a portion of his army ravaged Avondale, and laid waste the districts of Carrick and Cunningham. The vassal king then passed to Ren frew, and affected a royal state in his Christmas festi vities, distributing lands and castles to his retainers, 1 Douglas's Peerage, vol. i. p. 133. 2 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, 8 Edward III. vol. i. p. 293. 3 Hemingford, vol. ii. p. 277."], [424, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1334-5. 416 and committing the chief management of his affairs to William Bullock a warlike ecclesiastic, whom he created chamberlain of Scotland, and governor of the important fortresses of St Andrews and Cupar.1 Such castles as he possessed were garrisoned with English soldiers ; and John de Strivelin, with a large force, commenced the siege of Lochleven, which was then in the hands of the friends of David Brace. From its insular situation, this proved a matter of difficulty. A fort, however, was built in the churchyard of Kin ross, on a neck of land nearest to the castle ; and from this point frequent boat attacks were made, in all of which the besiegers were repulsed. At last Alan Vipont the Scottish governor, seizing the opportunity when Strivelin wTas absent on a religious pilgrimage to the shrine of St Margaret at Dunfermline, attacked and carried the fort, put part of the* English garrison to the sword, and raised the siege. He then returned to the castle with his boats laden with arblasts, bows, and other instruments of war,2 besides other booty and many prisoners. Encouraged by this success, and anxious to engage in a systematic plan of military operations, the Scottish regents summoned a parliament to meet at Dairsay. It was attended by Sir Andrew Moray ; the Earl of Athole ; the Knight of Liddesdale, lately returned from captivity ; the Earl of March, who had embraced the party of David Bruce and renounced his alle giance to Edward ; Alexander de Mowbray, and other Scottish barons.

His motives cannot easily be discovered. It is probable that, as he became convinced that Baliol would never be suffered to reign in Scotland, his own claims to the crown became uppermost in his mind, and that he was induced to renounce the allegiance which he had sworn to Edward, in the hope that, if Baliol were set aside, he might have a chance, amid the confusions of war, to find his way to the throne. He appeared accordingly at the parliament, with a state and train of attendants almost kingly ; and, having gained an ascendency over the young Steward, treated Moray and Douglas with such haughtiness, that the assembly became disturbed by mutual animo sities and heart-burnings, and at length broke up in confusion.1 Ambassadors soon after this arrived in England from Philip of France, earnestly recommend ing a cessation of hostilities between his ancient allies the Scots and the King of England ; but Edward, intent upon his scheme of conquest, although he con sented to a short truce, continued his warlike prepa rations, and, despising all mediation, determined again to invade his enemies, and dictate the terms, not of peace, but of absolute submission. About midsummer, the English king, accompanied by Baliol, joined his army at Newcastle, having along with him the Earl of Juliers, with Henry count of Montbellegarde, and a large band of foreign merce naries.2 Meanwhile his fleet, anticipating the move ments of the land forces, entered the Firth of Forth ; and while Edward, with one part of his army, advanced by Carlisle into Scotland, Baliol, having along with 1 Fordun a Goodal, book xiii. chap. xxiv. vol. ii. p. 317. 2 Leland, Collect, vol. i. p. 555.

But, notwithstanding the great preparations, the campaign was one of little interest. Having penetrated to Glasgow, the two kings united their forces, and advanced to Perth without meeting an enemy. By an order of the regents, the Scots drove their cattle and removed their goods from the plain country, to inaccessible fastnesses among the mountains ; so that the English only wasted a country already deserted by its inhabitants.1 They did not, however, entirely escape molestation ; for the Scottish barons, although too prudent to oppose them in a pitched field, hovered round their line of march, and more than once caught them at a disadvantage, suddenly assaulting them froi\u00bb some concealed glen or ambush, and cutting off large bodies who had separated themselves from the main army. In this way, a party of five hundred archers were attacked and cut to pieces by Moray the regent, and Sir William Douglas.2 On another occasion, the Earls of March and Moray fell upon the Earl of Namur, as he was leading his band of foreign knights to join Edward at Perth. The two parties met on the Borough Muir ; for the foreign troops, imagining that the coun try was wholly in possession of the English, had advanced fearlessly towards Edinburgh. The merce naries, however, clad in complete steel, and strongly mounted, made a desperate defence ; nor was it till the appearance of the Knight of Liddesdale, with a reinforcement, that they found themselves compelled to retreat into the town.

They dwell with much complacency on a famous stroke made by Sir David de Annand, a Scottish knight, who, enraged by a wound from one of the mercenaries, raised himself in his stirrups, and wielding a ponderous battle-axe with both hands, hewed down his opponent with such force, that the weapon cut sheer through man and horse, and was only arrested by the stone pavement, where the mark of the blow was shown in the time of the historian.1 The foreign soldiers were at last driven up the High Street to the castle. This fortress had been dismantled ; but Namur and his knights took their stand on the rock, and hav ing killed their horses, piled their bodies into a mound, behind wThich they, for a while, kept the Scots in check. They were at last compelled to surrender ; and Moray and Douglas treated their noble prisoner, who was near kinsman to their ally the King of France, with much generosity.2 He and his brother knights and soldiers were set at liberty without ransom, and their captors accompanied them with an escort across the English border. But this act of courtesy cost Moray dear ; for, on his return, his little party was attacked by the English, under William de Pressen warden of Jedburgh Forest, and entirely routed. The regent was taken prisoner, and instantly ironed, and shut up in the strong castle of Bamborough ; Douglas, how ever, had the good fortune to escape a second captivity in England, but his brother James Douglas was slain.3 1 Extracta ex Chronicis Scoti\u00e6, folio 197.

From Perth, Edward and Baliol made a destructive progress through the north of Scotland ; and soon after, the Earl of Cornwall, brother to the King of England, along with Sir Anthony Lucy, ravaged the western district of the kingdom, not even sparing the religious houses, but razing the churches to the ground, aud burning along with them the unhappy wretches who had there taken sanctuary. After this he marched to Perth, and joined his forces to those of the king, who had returned from his northern expedition.1 At this melancholy crisis, when, to use an expres sion of an ancient historian, none but children in their games dared to call David Brace their king,2 the Earl of Athole showed his versatile and selfish character. The captivity of Moray the regent had delivered him from a formidable opponent ; and his ambition now prompted him to aspire to the vacant office of regent, for the purpose, as was shown by the result, of grati fying his rapacity and his revenge. He accordingly informed Edward that he and his friends were willing to make their final submission ; and he despatched five deputies, who concluded a treaty at Perth, in which the English monarch agreed that \" the Earl of Athole, and all other Scottish barons who came under his peace, should receive a free pardon, and have their estates in Scotland secured.\"3 By another article, the large English estates of this powerful baron were restored to him ; and to give a colour of public zeal to an agreement essentially selfish, it was stipulated that the franchises of the Scottish church, and the ancient laws of Scotland, should be preserved as they 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 323.

Ed ward, having repaired the fortifications of Perth, returned to England ; and the new governor, anxious to distinguish himself in the service of his master, began to slay or imprison the friends of Bruce, and to confiscate their estates, with a rapacity which filled the hearts of the people with an eager desire of ven geance.2 Nor was it long before this feeling was gratified. The handful of brave men who still obstinately sup ported their independence, chose for their leader Sir Andrew Moray of Bothwell, in early life the pupil of Wallace,a soldier of great experience, and of undoubted integrity. This hardy veteran did not long remain inactive ; and his first enterprise was eminently suc cessful. It happened that, within Kildrummie,3 a strong castle in Aberdeenshire, his wife, a noble matron, sister of Robert Bruce, had maintained her self during the insolent administration of Athole, wTho, eager to make himself master of so valuable a captive, instantly attacked it. Moray hastily collected a small army, and burning with a resentment which was kindled by a sense both of public and private wrongs, flew to raise the siege : he was accompanied by the Knight of Liddesdale and the Earl of March. Their troops encountered those of Athole in the forest of Kilblene, and, after a short resistance, entirely dis persed them : Athole himself, with five knights who attended him, was slain in the wood.4 He died young 1 Tyrrel, vol. iii. p. 387. 2 Fordun a Hearne, vol. iv. p. 1026. 3 Supra, p. 407. 4 Winton, book viii. chap. xxxi. vol. ii. p. 201.

Insolent and unsteady, he yet possessed, from his immense estates and noble birth, a great capacity of doing mischief; and not only his last agreement with Edward, but the indiscriminate cruelty with which he was at that moment hunting down the few remaining friends of liberty, rendered his death, at this crisis, little less than a public benefit. It was followed by the election of Sir Andrew Moray to the regency of the kingdom, in a parliament held at Dunfermline. x It might have been evident to Edward, long before this, that although it was easy for him to overrun Scotland, and destroy the country by the immense military power which he possessed, yet the nation itself was farther than ever from being subdued. The people were strong in their love of liberty, and in their detestation of Baliol, whom they now regarded with the bitterest feelings of contempt. It was true, indeed, that many of their highest nobles, swayed by private ambition, did not hesitate to sacrifice their patriotism to the lust of power ; yet, amongst the barons and gentry, there was a remnant left, animated by better feelings, and thus the spirit of resistance was kept up against the power of England. This was remarkably shown in the history of the present period. The death of Athole was followed by the reappearance of Edward in Scotland, at the head of a formidable army, strengthened by the accession of the Anglicized Scottish barons and their numerous vassals. Alarmed at the declaration, now openly made by the French king, of his intention to assist 1 Fordun a Hearne, p. 1028."], [431, "1335. DAVID II. 423 his ancient allies,1 and prompted by the restless desire, so often formed, and so constantly defeated, of com pleting the subjugation of the country, the English monarch penetrated first to Perth, and afterwards into the more northern parts of the kingdom. His march was, as usual, marked by the utter destruction of the districts through which it lay. The counties of Aberdeen, Nairn, and Inverness, with their towns and villages, were wasted by fire and sword ; but he in vain endeavoured to bring the regent, Sir Andrew Moray, to a battle.2 Under the command of this leader, the Scots, intimately acquainted with the country, were ever near their enemy, and yet always invisible to them ; and an anecdote of a masterly re treat, made during this northern campaign, has been preserved, which is characteristic of the cool discipline of Moray. On one occasion, word being brought to Edward that the regent was encamped in the wood of Stronkaltere,3 he instantly marched against him. The intelligence was found to be true ; the English and Scottish outposts came in sight of each other in a winding road leading through the wood, and, after some skirmishing, the Scots fell back to inform Moray of the near approach of the English army. The general was then at mass, and, although the danger was imminent, none dared to interrupt him till the service was concluded. On being told that Edward and his army were at hand in the forest, he observed there was no need of haste ; and, when the squires brought him his horse, began quietly to adjust its furniture, and to see that the girths were tight and 1 Rymer, vol. iv. pp. 704, 705, 706.

When this was going on, the English every moment came nearer, and the Scottish knights around Moray showed many signs of impatience. This, it may be imagined, was not lessened when one of the straps which braced his thigh armour snapt as he buckled it ; and the regent, turning to an attendant, bade him bring a coffer from his baggage, from which he took a skin of leather, and, sitting down leisurely on the bank, cut off a broad strip, with which he mended the fracture. He then returned the box to its place, mounted his horse, arrayed his men in close column, and commenced his retreat in such order, that the English did not think it safe to attack him ; and having at last gained a narrow defile, he disappeared from their view without losing a man. \" I have heard,\" says Winton, \"from knights who were then present, that in all their life they never found time to go so slow, as when their old commander sat cutting his leather skin in the wood of Stronkaltere.\" x The widow of Athole was, soon after this, shut up by the army of Moray in the castle of Lochendorb : she was the daughter of Henry Beaumont, who, for getful of the conditions under which he had obtained his freedom at Dundarg, had accompanied Edward into Scotland; and she now earnestly implored the king and her father to have compassion on her infant and herself, and to raise the siege. It was an age in which the ordinary events of the day assumed a chivalrous and romantic character. A noble matron in sorrow for the slaughter of her husband, beleaguered in a wild mountain fortress, and sending for succour to the King of England and his barons, is in incident simi lar to what we look for in Amadis or Palmerin. The 1 Winton, vol. ii. pp. 204, 205."], [433, "1336. DAVID II. 425 monarch obeyed the call, and hastened to her rescue. On his approach, the regent again retired into the woods and morasses ; and the king, having freed the countess from her threatened captivity, wasted with fire and sword the rich province of Moray. Unable, however, to dislodge the Scottish commander from his strengths, he was at last compelled to leave the country, with the conviction that every forest or mountain-hold which he passed afforded a shelter for his enemies, who would reappear the instant he retreated. He endea voured, however, more effectually to overawe the spirit of resistance, by having a powerful fleet in the Firth of Forth, and on the eastern and western coasts of the kingdom ; 2 and before he retired, he repaired and gar risoned anew the most important fortresses in the king dom. He then left a reinforcement of troops with his army at Perth, intrusted the command to his brother, the Earl of Cornwall, and returned to England. On his departure, Sir Andrew Moray instantly ap peared from his fastnesses. Sir William Douglas the Knight of Liddesdale, Sir William Keith, and other patriot barons, assembled their vassals ; and the castles of Dunotter, Kinclevin, and Laurieston, were wrested from the English, after which, according to Bruce's old practice, they were broken up and dis mantled.2 Soon after, the regent made himself master of the tower of Falkland and the castles of St Andrews, Leuchars, and Bothwell, which he razed and destroyed.3 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. pp. 318, 322. 2 Fordun a Hearne, vol. iv. p. 1030.

The lords marchers of England has tened with a strong body of troops to relieve it. They were encountered by William Douglas the Knight of Liddesdale, near Crichton castle, and, after much hard fighting, were compelled to retire across the Tweed. But Douglas was grievously wounded, and his little army so crippled with the loss which he sustained, that Moray deemed it expedient to abandon the siege.2 During the whole of this obstinate war, the French king had never ceased to take a deep interest in the affairs of his allies. Before David had been compelled to take refuge in his kingdom, he had sent him a seasonable present of a thousand pounds.3 By his earnest remonstrances he had succeeded in procuring many truces in favour of the Scots ; and, as the breach between France and England gradually grew wider, the French ships had occasionally assisted the Scottish privateers in infesting the English coast, and had sup plied them with stores, arms, and warlike engines.4 Against these maritime attacks, it was the policy of Edward to arm the vessels of the petty sea-kings, who 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 324.

He now endeavoured to gain time, by amusing the Scots with the hopes of a general peace ; but the barons who led the opposition against England were well informed of the approaching rupture with France, and, awrare that the opportunity was favourable for the entire expulsion of the English, they rejected all overtures for a pacification, and pushed on the war with vigour. The event showed the wisdom of such conduct ; for the English monarch had advanced too far in his quarrel with Philip to withdraw, or even postpone, his pretensions\"; and, to the great joy of the Scots, war between the two countries was declared, by Edward making his public claim to the crown of France on the 7th of October, 1337.2 The Earls of Arundel, Salisbury, and Norfolk, with Edward Baliol, were now left in command of the army in Scotland ; and, on the failure of the negotiations for peace, Salisbury laid siege to the castle of Dunbar, 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. iv. p. 711.

When the stones from the engines of the besiegers struck upon the battlements, she directed one of her maidens to wipe off the dust with a white napkin, a species of female defiance which greatly annoyed the English soldiers. Perpetually on the ramparts, or at the gate, she exposed her person in every situa tion of danger, directing the men-at-arms and the archers, and extorting even the praise of her enemies by her determined and warlike bearing. It happened that an arrow from one of the Scottish archers struck an English knight, who stood beside the Earl of Salisbury, through his surcoat, and, piercing the habergeon, or chained mail-coat, which was below it, made its way through three plicatures of the acton which he wore next his body, and killed him on the spot. \" There,\" cried Salisbury, \" comes one of my lady's tire-pins : Agnes's love-shafts go straight to the heart.\" At length the English, foiled in every assault, and finding that the strength of the walls defied the efforts of their battering engines, judged it necessary to convert the siege into a blockade. This had nearly succeeded. A fleet, amongst which were 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 325. 2 Winton, vol. ii. p. 208."], [437, "1337-8.

Favoured by the darkness, he passed unobserved through the line of the enemy's fleet, and ran his ship, laden with provisions, and with forty stout soldiers on board, close under the wall of the castle. This last success deprived A run del and Salisbury of their only hope of making themselves masters of this important fortress ; and, mortified by repeated failure, they withdrew the army, and retired with the disgrace of having been foiled for five months, and at last entirely defeated, by a woman.1 Edward now began to experience the distress which the expense of a double war, and the necessity of maintaining an army both in France and Scotland, necessarily entailed upon him. Animated by the fiercest resentment, the Scots, under the guidance of such able soldiers as the regent, the Knight of Lid desdale, and Ramsay of Dalhousie, were now strong enough to keep the open country, which they cleared of their enemies, compelling the English to confine themselves within the walls of their castles. Edin burgh, Perth, Stirling, Cupar, and Roxburgh, were still in their hands, and the king commanded large supplies of provisions to be levied upon his English subjects, and transported into Scotland; but this occasioned grievous discontent, and in some cases the commissaries were attacked and plundered.2 Nor 1 Fordun a Hearne, vol. iv. p. 1032.

Sir William Douglas the Knight of Liddesdale, whose bravery procured him the title of the Flower of Chivalry, expelled the English from Teviotdale ; overpowered and took prisoner Sir John Stirling at the head of five hundred men-at-arms; intercepted a convoy near Melrose as it proceeded to the castle of Hermitage, which he soon after reduced ; attacked and defeated Sir Roland de Vaux ; and routed Sir Laurence Abernethy, after a conflict repeatedly renewed, and obstinately contested.1 Meanwhile, in the spirit of the age, these desperate encounters were sometimes abandoned for the more pacific entertainments of jousts between the English and Scottish knights, the result of which sometimes proved little less fatal than in the conflicts of actual war ; whilst to a modern reader they throw a strong light on the manners of the times. Henry de Lan caster earl of Derby, with great courtesy, sent a herald to request the Knight of Liddesdale to run with him three courses ; but in the first, Douglas was wounded, by a splinter of his own lance, in the hand, and compelled to give up the contest. The English earl then entreated Sir Alexander Ramsay of Dal housie to hold a solemn jousting for three days at Berwick, twenty against twenty ; a proposition which was instantly accepted ; but it turned out a sanguinary 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 329."], [439, "1338.

Two English knights were slain ; and Sir William Ramsay wTas struck through the bars of his aventaile by a spear, which penetrated so deep, that it was deemed certain he would expire the moment it was extracted. He wTas confessed, therefore, in his armour ; and as the knights crowded round, \" So help me Heaven,\" said Derby, who stood hard by, \" I would desire to see no fairer sight than this brave baron thus shrived with his helmet on ; happy man should I be, could I ensure myself such an ending.\" Upon this, Sir Alexander Ramsay placed his foot upon his kinsman's helmet, and by main force pulled out the broken truncheon, when the wounded knight started on his feet, and declared he should soon ail nothing. He died, however, immediately in the lists.1 \" What stout hearts these men have !\" was Derby's observation ; and with this laconic remark the joust ing concluded. On another occasion, Sir Patrick de Graham, a Scottish knight, having arrived from France, Lord Richard Talbot begged to have a joust with him, and wTas borne out of his saddle and wound ed, though not dangerously, through his habergeon. Graham was then invited to supper ; and in the midst of the feast, an English knight, turning to him, cour teously asked him to run with him three courses. \" Sir knight,\" replied Graham, \" if you would joust with me, I advise you to rise early and confess, after which you will soon be delivered.\" This was said in mirth, but it proved true ; for in the first course, which took place next morning, Graham struck the English knight through the harness with a mortal wound, so that he died on the spot.2 Such were the fierce pastimes of those days of danger 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. i. p. 329.

On resuming the war, the tide of success still continued with the Scots, and Sir Alexander Ramsay rivalled the fame of the Knight of Liddes dale. At the head of a strong band of soldiers, he infested the rocky and wooded banks of the Esk ; and concealing himself, his followers, and his booty, in the caves of Hawthornden, sallied from their recesses, and carried his depredations to the English borders, cruelly ravaging the land, and leading away from the smoking hamlets and villages many bands of captives. In these expeditions his fame became so great, that there was not a noble youth in the land who considered his mili tary education complete, unless he had served in the school of this brave captain.1 On one occasion he was pursued and intercepted by the lords marchers in a plain near Werk castle ; but Ramsay attacked and routed the enemy, took Lord Robert Manners prisoner, and put many to the sword.2 About this time Scotland lost one of its ablest sup porters. Sir Andrew Moray the regent, sinking under the weight of age, and worn out by the constant fatigues of war, retired to his castle at Avoch, in Ross, where he soon after died ; upon which the high stew ard was chosen sole governor of Scotland. Moray, in early life, had been chosen by Wallace as his part ner in command ; and his subsequent military career was not unworthy of that great leader. His character, as it is given by Winton, possesses the high merit of having been taken from the lips of those who had served under him, and knew him best. He was, says he, a lord of great bounty ; of sober and chaste life ; wise and upright in council; liberal and generous; devout and charitable; stout, hardy, and of great 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 333. 2 Ibid.

DAVID II. 433 courage.1 He was endowed with that cool, and some what stern and inflexible character of mind, which peculiarly fitted him to control the fierce temper of the feudal nobility, at a period when the task was especially difficult ; and it may be added, that, when the bravest, despairing for their country, had, by the sacrifice of its independence, saved their estates, Moray scorned to follow such examples; and, imitating his old master in arms, Wallace, appears never to have sworn fealty to any king of England. He was buried in the little chapel of Rosmartin ; but his body was afterwrards raised and carried to Dunfermline, where it now mingles with the heroic dust of Bruce and Randolph.2 The first act of the Steward was to despatch the Knight of Liddesdale upon a mission to the court of France, to communicate with King Philip, and to procure assistance. He then assembled his army, and commenced the siege of Perth, upon the fortifications of which the English, considering it a station of the first importance, had expended vast sums of money. Meanwhile Baliol, universally hated by his country men, became an object of suspicion to the English ; and leaving Perth, in obedience to the orders of Ed ward, retired, a pensioned dependant, into England. Ughtred, a baron who had long served in the Scottish war, undertook its defence, and for ten weeks the town resisted every effort of the besiegers; so that the army of the Steward began to meditate a retreat, when there suddenly appeared in the Tay five French ships of war. This squadron was commanded by Hugh Hautpile, a skilful naval officer, and had on board a strong party 1 Winton, vol. ii. p. 217. \" Fordun a Hearne, vol. iv. p. 1032. VOL.

Along with them came the Knight of Liddesdale ; and immediately, all idea of relinquish ing the siege being abandoned, hostilities recommenced, by the French ships seizing the English victualling vessels, and effectually cutting off every supply from the garrison. At this time William Bullock, Baliol's chancellor, who commanded in the castle of Cupar, which had baffled the attack of the late regent, betrayed his master, and joined the army before Perth. This mili tary ecclesiastic was one of those extraordinary indi viduals, whom the troubled times of civil disorder so frequently call out from the quiet path to which more ordinary life would have confined them. His talents for state affairs and for political intrigue were great ; yet we are told by the historians of the time, that his ability in these matters was exceeded by his uncom mon genius for war : and we cannot wonder that these qualities made him to be dreaded and courted by all parties. In addition to this, he was ambitious, selfish, and fond of money : passions which could not be gra tified if he continued attached to a falling cause. Accordingly, the arrival of the French auxiliaries, the desertion of Scotland by Baliol, with the bribe of an ample grant of lands,2 induced him to renounce the English alliance, and deliver up the castle where he commanded. He then joined the army besieging 1 Froissart par Buchon, vol. i. p. 211. Compot. Camerarii Scoti\u00e6, pp. 255, 277.

Although the Knight of Liddesdale was grievously wounded by a javelin, thrown from one of the spring- aids, and the twro captains of the Scottish archers slain, yet Bullock insisted in continuing and pressing the siege ; : and the Earl of Ross, with a body of miners, having contrived to make a subterranean ex- cavation under the walls, drew off the water from the fosse surrounding the town, and rendered an assault more practicable. The minuteness of one of our ancient chronicles has preserved a striking circumstance which occurred during the siege. In the midst of the mili- tary operations the sun became suddenly eclipsed, and, as the darkness gradually spread over all, the soldiers of both armies forgot their duties, and, sinking under the influence of superstitious terror, gazed fearfully on the sky.2 Bullock, however, unintimidated by what was then considered an omen of wrath, gave orders for the tents to be struck and pitched nearer the town, previous to his attempt to storm ; but the English governor had now lost resolution ; and seeing his pro- visions exhausted, his hope of supplies cut off, and his fosse dry and ready to be filled by the fagots of the besiegers, capitulated upon honourable terms. The soldiers of the garrison and the governor Ughtred were instantly shipped for England, where his conduct became the subject of parliamentary inquiry.3 Thus 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 330.

It is difficult to imagine a more lamentable picture than that presented by the utter desolation of Scotland at this period. The famine, wThich had been felt for some years, now raged in the land. Many had quitted their country in despair, and taken refuge in Flanders ; others, of the poorer sort, were driven into the woods, and, in the extremities of hunger, feeding upon the raw nuts and acorns which they gathered, were seized with diseases which carried them off in great agony.2 The continued miseries of war reduced the district round Perth to the state of a desert, where there was neither house for man, nor harbour for cattle ; and the wild deer coming down from the mountains, resumed possession of the desolate region, and ranged in herds within a short distance of the town. It is even said, that some unhappy wretches were driven to such ex tremities of want and misery, as to prey upon human flesh : and that a horrid being, vulgarly called Cristi cleik, from the iron hook with which he seized his victims, took up his abode in the mountains, and, assisted by a ferocious female, with whom he lived, lay in ambush for the travellers who passed near his den, and methodically exercised the trade of a canni bal.3 The story is perhaps too dreadful for belief; yet Winton, who relates it, is in no respect given to the marvellous ; and a similar circumstance is recorded as late as the reign of James the Second.

As he mounted the ladder in complete armour, he was struck down by a stone thrown from the ram parts, and, falling heavily and awkwardly, was thrust through by his own spear.2 It is related by Frois sart, that cannon were employed at the siege of Stir ling ; but the fact is not corroborated by contemporary historians. Scotland had of late years suffered severely from famine, and had owed its support more to provisions surreptitiously imported from England, than to the fruits of native industry.3 But the exertions of the High-steward, and his fellow soldiers Douglas and Ramsay, had now expelled the English from nearly the whole country : the castles of Edinburgh, Jed burgh, Lochmaben, and Roxburgh, with some inferior strengths in their vicinity, were all that remained in the hands of Edward ; and the regent seized a short interval of peace to make a progress through the coun try, for the re-establishment of order, and the distri- 1 Lord Hailes seems to have antedated the siege of Stirling, when he places it in the year 1339.

What was the exact date of the first siege is uncertain, but it seems to have been interrupted by an armistice. Fordun a Hearne, p. 1031, asserts, that Sir William Keith was slain at the siege of Stirling in 1337 ; but the date is an error. 2 Winton, vol. ii. p. 237. 3 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. p. 541."], [446, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1341. 438 bution of justice.1 The good effects of this were soon observable in the gradual revival of regular industry : to use the strong language of Bower, the kingdom began to breathe anew ; husbandmen once more were seen at the plough, and priests at the altar ; but the time which was allowed proved too short to give permanency to these changes. War suddenly recommenced with great fury ; and the castle of Edinburgh, commanded by Limosin, an English knight, fell into the hands of the enemy. The Scots owed the possession of this fortress to a stratagem of Bullock, the late governor of Cupar, executed with address and boldness by the Knight of Liddesdale. The castle was strongly fortified both by art and nature ; and as its garrison scoured and commanded the country round, they gave great annoyance to the Scots. Douglas, who lurked in the neighbourhood with two hundred soldiers, procured Walter Curry, a merchantman of Dundee,2 to ran his ship into the Forth, under pretence of its being an English victual ling vessel, and to make an offer to supply the garrison with wine and corn. The device succeeded ; and the porter, without suspicion, opened the outer gate and lowered the drawbridge to the wagons and hampers of the pretended merchant and his drivers, who, throw ing off the gray frocks which covered their armour, stabbed the warden in an instant, and sounded a horn, which called up Douglas and his men from their am bush at the foot of the hill. All this could not be so rapidly executed, but that the cry of treason alarmed the governor ; and the soldiers arming in haste, and 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. pp. 331, 332. 2 Curry seems to have been assisted by another person, named William Fairley.

DAVID II. 439 crowding to the gates, began a desperate conflict. The wagons, however, had been so dexterously placed, that it became impossible to let down the portcullis ; and Douglas, rushing in with his men, soon decided the affair. Of the garrison, only the governor, Limosin, and six esquires, escaped ; 1 the rest were put to the sword, and the command of the castle was intrusted to a natural brother of the Knight of Liddesdale. There are two particulars regarding this spirited enterprise, which are worthy of remark. Curry was a Scotsman, yet it seems he found no difficulty in in troducing himself as an English merchant, from which there arises a strong presumption, that the languages spoken in both countries were nearly the same ; and both he and his followers, before they engaged in the enterprise, took the precaution of shaving their beards, a proof that the Norman fashion of wearing no beard, had not been adopted in Scotland in the fourteenth century.2 Soon after this success, the regent and the estates of Scotland, considering the kingdom to bo almost cleared of their enemies, sent an embassy to France, requesting that their youthful sovereign would return to his dominions. David accordingly, who had now for nine years been an exile in a foreign land, embarked wTith his queen ; and although the English ships had already greatly annoyed the Scots, and still infested the seas, he had the good fortune to escape all interruption, and to land in safety at Innerbervie, at the mouth of the Bervie in Kincardineshire, on the 4th of June, wThere he was received with the utmost joy by all classes of his subjects.3 The young king was now in his eighteenth year, and 1 Froissart, vol. i. p. 359.

This was the more to be regretted, as the circumstances in which he found the country upon his arrival, were such as, to manage successfully, required a union of great pru dence and firmness. In the minority which had taken place since the death of Bruce, and in the absence of the name and power of a king, a race of fierce and independent barons had grown up, who ruled at will over their own vast estates, and despised the autho rity of the laws. Between the king and the Steward of Scotland, who now laid down his office of regent, there does not appear to have been any cordial feel ings ; and it is probable that David never forgot the conspiracy of Athole in 1334, by which this fickle and ambitious baron, and the Steward, then a young man, acknowledged Baliol, and made their peace with Ed ward. Athole indeed was slain, and the subsequent conduct of the Steward had been consistent and patriotic ; but the king could not fail to regard him with that jealousy, which a monarch, without children, is apt to feel towards the person whom the parliament had declared his successor, and who had already, on one occasion, shown so little regard for his allegiance. As for the other powerful barons, the Knight of Liddesdale, his kinsman Lord William Douglas, the Earl of Moray, Sir Alexander Ramsay of Dalhousie, and Bullock, who soon after became chamberlain, they"], [449, "1342. DAVID II. 441 were indeed unanimous in their opposition to England; but a long possession of military power made them impatient of the control of a superior, and it was almost impossible for a sovereign to confer his favours upon them, without exciting jealousy and dissension. All this, in a short time, became apparent ; and a thoughtless measure, which the monarch adopted soon after his arrival, evinced his ignorance and want of judgment in a fatal manner. Sir Alexander Ramsay of Dalhousie had distinguished himself in the Scottish wars, and was universally beloved in the country for his brave and patriotic qualities. Scarcely had the young king arrived in his dominions, when word was brought him, that Roxburgh castle, a fortress of great strength and importance, had been taken in a night escalade by this baron, upon whom, in the first ardour of bis gratitude, David conferred the government of the place, and along with it the sheriffship of Teviot dale.1 This was a generous but thoughtless act, and certainly unjust, for the Knight of Liddesdale then held the office of sheriff; and a fierce and deadly en mity arose in the breast of Douglas against Ramsay, his old companion in arms. His way of revenging himself affords a melancholy proof of the lawless independence of these feudal nobles, as well as of the treachery of his disposition. He first pretended to be reconciled to Ramsay ; and, having silenced suspicion by treating him with his usual friendship, led a band of soldiers to Hawick, where he knew that the new sheriff held his court in the open church. It is said that Ramsay was warned of his intention, but, trust ing to the reconciliation which had taken place, dis credited the story. On Douglas entering the church, 1 Winton, vol. ii. p. 252."], [450, "1342. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 442 Ramsay invited him to take, his place beside him ; on which that fierce baron drew his sword, seized his victim, who was wounded in attempting a vain re sistance, and throwing him bleeding across a horse, carried him off to his castle of Hermitage, where he thrust him into a dungeon. It happened that there was a granary above his prison, and some particles of corn fell through the chinks and crevices of the floor, upon which he supported a miserable existence for seventeen days, and at last died of hunger.1 It is a melancholy reflection, that a fate so horrid befell one of the bravest and most popular leaders of the Scottish nation ; and that the deed did not only pass unrevenged, but that its perpetrator received a speedy pardon, and was rewarded by the office which had led to the murder. Douglas became governor of Roxburgh castle, sheriff of Teviotdale, and protector of the middle marches, and owed his pardon and pre ferment to the intercession of the High-steward of Scotland. In attempting to form an estimate of the manners of the age, it ought not to be forgotten that this savage murder was perpetrated by a person who, for his knightly qualities, was styled the \" Flower of Chivalry.\" It wTas an invariable effect of the principle of vassalage in the feudal system, that the slaughter of any of the greater barons rendered it an imperative duty, in every one who followed his banner, to revenge his death upon all who were in the most remote degree connected with it ; so that we are not to wonder that the assassination of Ramsay was followed by intermi- 1 Winton, vol. ii. p. 254.

DAVID II. 443 nable feuds, dissensions, and conspiracies, not only amongst the higher nobility, but amongst the lesser barons. It was probably one of these plots, of which it is impossible now to detect the ramifications, that accelerated the fate of Bullock, the able and intriguing ecclesiastic renegade, who had deserted Baliol to join the king. Having become suspected by his master, he was suddenly stript of his honours, deprived of the high offices in which he had amassed immense wealth, and cast amongst the meanest criminals, into a dun geon of the castle of Lochendorb, in Moray, where he was starved to death. The probable truth seems to be, that Bullock, a man of high talents, but the slave of ambition and the love of intrigue, had been tam pering with the English, and that his fate, though cruel, was not unmerited.1 The period immediately following the arrival of David in his dominions till we reach the battle of Durham,2 is undistinguished by any events of impor tance. The Scots, writh various success, invaded and ravaged the border counties of England ; but a revolt of the island chief, John of Argyle, and other northern barons,3 recalled the king's attention to the unsettled state of his affairs at home, and made him willing to accede to a two years' truce with England. This interval was employed by Edward in an attempt to seduce the Knight of Liddesdale from his allegiance ; and there seems reason to think that a conspiracy, at the head of which was this brave, but fickle soldier, and which had for its object the restoration of Baliol to the crown, wTas organizing throughout Scotland, and that Bullock, whose fate we have just recounted, 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 336. \u00bb Knighton, p. 2581. 2 From 1342 to 1346."], [452, "4^4 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1343-6. was connected with the plot.1 It is certain, at least, that Douglas had repeated private meetings with Baliol and the English commissioners ; that he had agreed to embrace the friendship of the King of England, and to receive a reward for his services.2 These treacherous designs however came to nothing. It may be that the stipulated reward was not duly paid ; or, perhaps, the fate of Bullock was a timely warning to Douglas ; and, anxious to wipe away all suspicion of treachery, the Knight of Liddesdale, regardless of the truce, broke across the borders at the head of a numerous army, burnt Carlisle and Penrith, and after a skirmish in which the Bishop of Carlisle was unhorsed, retreated precipitately into Scotland. After this recommencement of hostilities, the mor tal antipathy between the two countries broke out with greater violence than before ; and the young king, believing Edward to be entirely occupied with his war on the continent, and anxious to produce a diversion in favour of his ally, Philip of France, gave orders for assembling an army, and resolved to invade England in person.3 The muster took place at Perth, and was greater than any known for a long period ; troops were drawn from the islands of Scotland, as well as the mainland ; but the Highland chiefs brought their deadly feuds along with them, and these soon broke out into bloodshed. The Earl of Ross assassi nated Ranald of the Isles in the monastery of Elcho, 1 This may be inferred, I think, from the circumstance that Bullock was seized by David de Berklay ; and Berklay himself was, not long after, waylaid and assassinated by John de Saint Michael, at the insti gation of the Knight of Liddesdale.

In one respect it wras wrorse than ominous ; for not only Ross's men left the army, but the soldiers of the Isles, deprived of their leader, dispersed in confusion ; whilst many of the inferior Highland lords, anxious for the preservation of their lands, privately deserted, and returned home ; so that the king found his forces greatly reduced in number. Inheriting, however, the bravery of his father, but, as the event showed, little of his admirable judgment and military skill, David pressed forward from Perth ; and, after rapidly traversing the intervening country, on reaching the border, sat down before the castle of Liddel, then commanded by Walter Selby. Selby was that fierce freebooting chief, whose services we have seen successfully employed by King Robert Bruce, to waylay and plunder the Roman cardinals in their ill-fated attempt to carry the bulls of excommu nication into Scotland. Since that time, he had lent himself to every party which could purchase his sword at the highest rate, and had lately espoused the quarrel of Edward Baliol, from whom he received a grant of lands in Roxburghshire.1 David brought his military engines to bear upon the walls, which, after six days' resistance, were demolished.2 He then stormed the castle, put the garrison to the sword, and ordered Selby to instant execution. After this success, the veteran experience of the Knight of Liddesdale advised a retreat.

Besides this, the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, and the Prelates of Durham, Carlisle, and Lincoln, assumed their tem poral arms, and with such of their church troops and vassals as had not accompanied the king, assembled to defend the country ; so that an army of thirty thou sand men, including a large body of men-at-arms, and twenty thousand English archers,2 were speedily on their march against the Scots. David, meanwhile, advanced to Hexham, and for fourteen days plundered and laid waste the country, leaving his route to be traced through the bishoprick of Durham by the flames of villages and hamlets. It seems to have excited unwonted resentment and hor- 1 Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 340. 2 Winton, vol. ii. pp. 260, 261. Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 341."], [455, "1346.

Satiated at length with plunder, the Scottish army encamped at a place called Beaurepair, now Bear Park, within a short distance of Durham. By this time, the English army had taken up their ground in the park of Bishop Auckland, not six miles distant from Beaurepair. The Scots' position w7as ill chosen. It was a plain or common, much intersected with ditches and hedges, which separated the divisions, and hindered them from supporting each other ; and the country round was of that undulated kind, that, unless the scouts were active, an enemy might approach within a few miles without being discovered. This was, in truth, the very event which happened ; and it gave melancholy proof that there were no longer such leaders as Bruce, or the Good Sir James, in the Scot tish army. At daybreak, the Knight of Liddesdale pushed on before the rest of the Scots. He led a strong squadron of heavy-armed cavalry, and, advancing for the pur pose of forage through the grounds near Sunderland, suddenly found himself in presence of the whole Eng lish army. The proximity of the enemy rendered a retreat as hazardous as a conflict ; yet Douglas at tempted to retire ; but his squadron was overtaken and driven back, with the loss of five hundred men, upon the main body of the Scots. David instantly drew up his army in three divisions. He himself led the centre ; the right wing was intrusted to the Earl of Moray ; while the Knight of Liddesdale and the Steward, with the Earl of Dunbar, commanded the left.

It was the same man\u0153uvre which had been successful at Bannockburn; but from ignorance or youthful obstinacy, David was deaf to his advice. \" Give me,\" cried Graham, in an agony of impatience, as the fatal phalanx of the archers advanced nearer and nearer, \"give me but a hundred horse, and I engage to disperse them all.\"2 Yet even this was unaccountably denied him ; and the brave baron, seconded by none but his own followers, threw himself upon the bowmen ; but it was too late : time had been given them to fix their arrows, and the deadly shower was sped. Graham's horse was shot under him, and he himself with difficulty escaped back to the army. It was now nine in the morning, (17th Oct. 1346,) and the whole English force had come up. A large crucifix was carried in the front of the line, around it waved innumerable banners and pennons, gorgeously embroidered, belonging chiefly to the church, and the close battle immediately began, under circumstances discouraging to the Scots. The discharge of the archers had already greatly galled and distressed them, the division commanded by the Earl of Moray was fiercely attacked by the English men-at-arms, the ditches and hedges which intersected the ground broke his array and impeded his movements, and the English cavalry charged through the gaps in the line, making a dreadful havock. At last Moray fell, and his 1 Winton, vol. ii. pp. 261, 262. 2 Winton, book viii. chap. xl. vol. ii. p. 262. Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 342."], [457, "1346.

The English then at tacked the main centre of the Scots, where David commanded in person : and as it also was drawn up in the same broken and enclosed ground, the various leaders and their vassals were separated, and fought at a serious disadvantage.1 Their flank, too, was exposed to the discharge of a body of ten thousand English bowmen ; and as the distance diminished, the arrows, flying with a truer aim and more fatal strength, told fearfully against the Scots. Yet the battle raged for three hours with great slaughter;2 and the young king, although he had evinced little military judgment in the disposition of his army, fought with obstinate and hereditary valour. He was defended by a circle of his nobility, who fell fast around him. The constable David de la Haye, Keith the marshal, Chartres the high chancellor, and Peebles the lord chamberlain, with the Earls of Moray and Strathern, and thirty barons belonging to the principal families in Scotland, were slain. The king himself, although grievously wounded by two arrows, one of which pierced deep, and could not be extracted without great agony, long continued to resist and encourage the few that were left around him. An English knight named Copland, at last broke in upon him, and after a hard struggle, in which two of his teeth were knocked out by the king's dagger,3 succeeded in overpowering and disarm ing him. On the capture of the king, the High-steward and the Earl of March, whose division had not suffered so severely, judging, probably, that any attempt to re store the day would be hopeless, drew off their troops, 1 Winton, vol. ii. p. 263. 3 Ibid. p. 264.

Amongst the prisoners, besides the king, were the Knight of Liddesdale, the Earls of Fife, Menteith, Sutherland, and Wigton, and fifty other barons and knights. It is not too high a computation, if we estimate the loss of the Scots in this fatal battle at fifteen thousand men.2 That of the English was exceedingly small, if we consider how long the conflict lasted. Froissart has asserted, that the English queen, Philippa, was in the field, and harangued the troops, mounted on a white charger. The story is contradicted by all the contemporary historians, both English and Scottish. A defeat so calamitous had not been sustained by Scotland since the days of Edward the First. Their best officers were slain or taken, and their king a cap tive. David, with the rest of the prisoners, was, after a short time, conveyed to London, and led in great state to the Tower, amid a guard of twenty thousand men-at-arms. The captive prince was mounted on a tall black courser, so that he could be seen by the whole people ; and the mayor and aldermen, with the various crafts of the city, preceded by their officers, and clothed in their appropriate dresses, attended on the occasion, and increased the effect of the pageant.3 On being lodged in the Tower, however, all expense and splendour were at an end ; and Edward, with an ungenerous economy, compelled his royal prisoner to 1 Fordun a Hearne, p. 1038.

The conduct of the Steward, in preferring the dictates of prudence, perhaps of ambition, to the feelings wrhich wrould have led him to have sacrificed his life in an attempt to rescue the king, cannot be easily exculpated. He and the Earl of March, with the third division of the army under their command, made good their retreat ; and their escape was ultimately fortunate for the country. But it excited a feeling of lasting personal resentment in the bosom of the king : it was probably the cause of that determined opposi tion which he ever aftemards manifested to the Steward ; and it is this unforgiving hostility, embit tered by the conviction that he owed his eleven years' captivity to the desertion at Durham, which can alone explain those extraordinary intrigues for substituting an English prince upon the throne, in wThich David, at a subsequent period, basely permitted himself to be involved. Meanwhile, the consequences of the battle of Durham were brilliant to England, but not lasting or important.

He took up his residence at the castle of Caerlaverock, on the shores of the Solway ;2 and having collected a strong force of the savage free booters of Galloway, was joined by Percy and Neville, with a large body of men-at-arms and mounted archers. At the head of this army he overran the Lothians, scoured the country as far as Glasgow, wasted Cunningham and Niddesdale, and rendered himself universally odious by the ferocity which marked his progress. At this time, Lionel duke of Ulster, the son of Edward the Third, became engaged in a mysterious transaction relative to the affairs in Scotland, upon which, unfortunately, no contemporary documents throw any satisfactory light. By an agreement, en tered into between this English prince and the Lords Henry Percy and Ralph Neville, these barons under took to assist Baliol with a certain force of men-at arms.

We know for certain, that on Baliol being for ever expelled from Scotland, Lionel engaged in the same political intrigue with David the Second. But, although the precise nature of this transaction is not easily dis coverable, it soon became apparent that the English king had no serious design of assisting Baliol in his recovery of the crown. At this conjuncture, the nobles who had escaped from Durham conferred the guardianship of the kingdom upon the High-steward -,1 and whatever imputations his conduct at Durham might have cast upon his personal ambition, it is certain that, as the enemy of the ambitious designs of England, and the strenuous assertor of the liberty of his country, the grandson of Bruce did not show him self unworthy of his high descent. During a season of unequalled panic and confusion he maintained the authority of the laws ; the command of the castles, and the government of the counties, wrere intrusted to men of tried fidelity ; and to procure a breathing time, negotiations were set on foot for a truce. 1 Fordun a Hearne, p. 1039."], [462, ""], [463, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS."], [464, ""], [465, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS.

Dr Lingard, in his History of England, vol. iii. p. 119, observes, that \" the Scottish king consented to an arrangement, by which, although he eluded the express recognition of feudal dependence, he seems to have conceded to Henry the whole substance of his demand.\" And the same acute historian has remarked, in the same volume, \" that when the Scottish king received a grant of land in Tynedale and at Penrith, and consented to perform a new homage for these possessions, the question as to the homage demanded for Scotland was left undecided.\" I much question the accuracy of these state ments ; and if the reader will take the trouble to turn to the first volume of the F\u0153dera, pages 374 and 428, he will at once perceive the ground of my dissent. The legitimate inference to be drawn from the documents in Rymer, is, that the question as to any homage due by Alexander the Second for his kingdom of Scotland, was decided against Henry in 1237, and that the English king acquiesced in the decision ; for it will be observed, the homage then paid was for his new acquisition,1 and there is no reservation of the claim of homage for Scotland. Again it appears, that this decision was vir tually enforced and repeated in the charter granted by Alexander in 1 244. Henry's demand had evidently been, that Alexander should perform homage to him for his kingdom of Scotland. Alexander, who at that time held lands in England, was reported, says Mathew Paris, to have \" answered bitterly, that he never did, and never would, hold a particle of land in Scotland under Henry,\" 2 but he at the same time was ready to take the oaths to Henry as his liege lord.

Lord Hailes is at a loss to settle the exact chronology of this sur render by Baliol, but Prynne enables us to do this with considerable accuracy. The scroll of the resignation was prepared at Kincardine on the 2d July. The penance took place in the churchyard at Strathkathro on the 7th of the same month ; 2 and the deed recording it is of the same date : after which, on the 10th July, at the castle of Brechin, in the presence of Edward himself, Baliol made his final resignation, and a second instrument was drawn up exactly in the same terms as the scroll prepared at Kincardine. Bower, in his additions to Fordun, is evidently in an error, when he states that Baliol underwent his penance and made his resignation at Montrose. Prynne, Edw. I. pp. 647, 650, 651. Baldred Bisset, the Scottish envoy at Rome, who was sent there to confute the claims of Edward to the superiority over Scotland, may perhaps have founded his accusation, that Edward had forged the instrument of Baliol's resig nation, upon this discrepancy in the dates. 1 I find in Mr Chambers's agreeable work, entitled \u00ab The Picture of Scot land,\" vol. ii. p. 255, that the tradition of the country affirms the penance of tfahol to have been performed at Strathkathro."], [473, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 465 Letter G, p. 120. A Diary of the Expedition of Edward in the year 1296, preserved in the Cottonian Collection, gives the following account of his progress.

Lord Hailes observes, p. 253, vol. i. that \" Buchanan, following Blind Harry, reports that the bridge broke down by means of a stratagem of Wallace.\" Buchanan, however, expressly says, that the \" bridge broke down either by the artifice of the carpenter, who had loosened the beams, as our historians assert, or from the weight of the English horse, foot, and machinery.\" Letter I, page 158. Hemingford, vol. i. p. 165, says, these compact bodies were in a circular form \u2014 \" qui quidem circuli Schiltronis vocabantur.\" Schil-"], [475, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 467 tron seems to denote nothing more than a compact body of men. It is thus used by Barbour in his poem of The Bruce, where he describes the battle of Bannockburn \u2014 \" For Scotsmen that them hard essayed, That then were in a schiltrum all.\" Walsingham, p. 75, affirms, that Wallace fortified the front of his position with long stakes driven into the ground, and tied together with ropes, so as to form a hedge. I find no mention of this in Hemingford ; nor in Fordun, Winton, or Trivet. Walsingham's account is vague, and unlike truth. He tells us, that Edward first commanded the attack to be made by the Welsh, and that they re fused ; upon which a certain knight addressed the king in two monk ish rhyming verses, in Latin. Hemingford's narrative, on the other hand, which I have chiefly followed, is strikingly circumstantial and interesting. He describes the battle of Stirling, as if he had the particulars from eye-witnesses ; and Lord Hailes conjectures, that this account of the battle of Falkirk was taken from the lips of some who had been present. Letter K, page 161. Trivet, p. 313, says, these two religious knights were slain in the beginning of the battle ; but I prefer the authority of Hemingford, p. 165, and Langtoft, p. 305-6. Lord Hailes, following Mathew of Westminster, p. 431, says that Bryan de Jaye was Master of the Knights Templars in England ; but it is certain, from the Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, 29 Edward I. mm. 12. 11., that he was Master of that Order in Scotland. We there find, \" Brianus de Jaye, Preceptor Militia? Templi in Scotia.'' There is a long note in Hailes upon the battle of Falkirk, Annals, vol. i. p. 262. Its object is to prove, that every account of the battle of Falkirk which has been given by Scottish historians, from Fordun to Abercromby, is full of misrepresentation, and, on this subject, the English historians are alone to be trusted. In these misrepresenta tions of the Scottish historians, he includes the assertion, \" that there were disputes between Wallace and the Scottish nobles ; that some of these nobles were guilty of treachery in abandoning the public cause ; and that, on the first onset, the Scottish cavalry withdrew, without striking a blow.'' That there was treachery among the Scottish nobles, is, howeve^ satisfactorily proved by Hemingford, an English historian. That the Scottish horse fled without striking a blow, \" absque ullo gladii"], [476, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 468 iclu,\" when the battle had just begun, i3 asserted by the same writer, Hemingford ; yet, singular to say, this does not appear to Hailes to be any thing like treachery. The Scottish cavalry were a body of a thousand armed horse, amongst whom were the flower of the Scottish knights and barons : are we to believe that these, from mere timidity, fled, before a lance was put in rest, and upon the first look of the English? But the note is also strikingly inconsistent with this author's own statement at p. 254, where, in giving an account of the feelings of the Scottish barons with regard to Wallace, he asserts, that \" his elevation wounded their pride ; his great services reproached their inactivity in the public cause ;'' that it was the language of the nobility, \" We will not have this man to rule over us ;\" and that \" the spirit of distrust inflamed the passions and perplexed the councils of the nation.'' This was the picture given by this historian, of the sentiments of the Scottish nobles on 29th March, 1298 : yet, when the Scottish historians observe, that at the battle of Falkirk, only four months after this, the Scottish nobility were weakened by dissensions, and their army enfeebled by envy of Wallace, the account is deemed wholly incredible.1 Letter L, page 161.

The negotiations between Philip and Edward, in 1297, on the point of including the kingdom of Scotland under the truce and pacification entered into at Tournay, were unknown to Lord Hailes, as the docu ment which contains so full and explicit an account of them was not published at the time he wrote his history. They throw an impor tant light on the conduct of Comyn, and the higher Scottish nobility 1 See Mr Aikman's Translation of Buchanan's History, (pages 410, 413, and 416,) for some remarks on Lord Hailes' accounts of the battles of Falkirk and Roslin, and his apology for Menteith."], [477, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 469 who refused to join Wallace in his resistance to Edward ; as they prove that one motive for their refusal might be, the hope that Philip's representations would induce Edward to include them and their coun try in the articles of truce, and in the subsequent treaty of peace, of which these articles were understood to be the basis. Even so late as the battle of Falkirk, July 22, 1298, Comyn, who drew off his vassals, and took no part in the day, might have indulged some hope that Philip's mediation, and the representations of the pope, would succeed in restoring peace to Scotland, and thus save his own lands, and the estates of the Scottish nobles. For Edward did not give his final answer, by which he totally excluded Scotland, and all its subjects, from the articles of truce and pacification, till the 19th August, 1298, (Rymer, vol. i. new edit. p. 898,) when he was in camp at Edinburgh. At the same time, although these negotiations give some explanation of the motives which might have influenced the nobles of Scotland in refusing to act with Wallace, they afford no excuse for their weak and selfish conduct. Letter N, page 185. This account of the battle of Roslin is taken from the English historians, Hemingford, Trivet, and Langtoft, and from our two most valuable and authentic Scottish historians, Winton and Fordun. Lord Hailes, who generally follows the English historians, has given a description of the battle in the shape of a critical note. He appears not to have consulted, when he composed his text, the curious and minute account given by Langtoft, vol. ii. p. 319, although he after- wards quotes him in the corrections and additions. So far from attempting to throw any veil over the events of the day, Langtoft is open and candid as to the entire defeat of the English. The same historian has fallen into a mistake, when he states the fact, in saying that Segrave, instead of falling back, rashly advanced and attacked the Scots. Segrave was surprised and attacked in his encampment by the Scots ; and so complete was the surprise, that his son and brother were taken in bed. As to the ridiculous story of Sir Robert Neville miraculously retrieving the day, and the invulnerable qualities conferred on those present at mass, it is a monkish tale, utterly unworthy of belief, as Langtoft informs us that Neville was slain. There is some inconsistency in the manner in which this historian has recounted the battle of Roslin. He was aware, he tells us, that the English historians, whom he follows, gave a partial account ; yet this account he incorporates into his text. He has brought no well grounded argument against the narrative of Winton and Fordun"], [478, "470 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. which is supported by the English historian, Langtoft ; yet he insin uates that the Scottish historians may have exaggerated the successes of the Scottish army at Roslin ; and with this affectation of superio rity to national prejudice, he quietly passes them over. Tyrrel, vol. iii. p. 153, says, quoting Walsingham and the Chron. Abingdonense, that Wallace headed the Scots in this battle ; but I find no authority in the Scottish writers for such an assertion. Letter 0, p. 189. The fortalice at Loehindorb is thus described by Mr Lewis Grant, in his Account of the Parish of Cromdale : \" A thick wall of mason work, twenty feet high even at this period, and supposed to have been much higher, surrounds an acre of land within the loch, with watch-towers at every corner, all entire. The entrance to this place is a gate built of freestone, which has a grandeur in it easier felt than expressed. Several vestiges of houses are found within the walls, besides those of a church, which, without difficulty, can still be traced in the ruins. Great rafts, or planks of oak, by the beating of the waters against the old walls, occasionally make their appearance. Tradition says, and some credit is due to the report, that the particu lar account of this building was lost in the days of King Edward the First of England.\" Had the worthy clergyman who wrote this, studied the history of Scotland in Fordun, infinitely the most valuable of all our historians, he would there have found that Edward, \"in propria persona ad Loehindorb pervenit, et ibidem aliquamdiu moram faciens, partes boreales ad pacem cepit.\" It is very delightful to find tradition thus throwing its shadowy reflection upon history, and history its clear and certain light upon tradition.

Lord Hailes observes, vol. i. p. 276, that \"the Scots fondly imagined that Edward would attempt to force the passage, as the impetuous Cressingham had attempted in circumstances not dissimilar ; but,\" he adds, \" the prudence of Edward frustrated their expectation ; having discovered a ford at some distance, he passed the river at the head of his whole cavalry.\" This is quite erroneous ; and Trivet, p. 337, whom he quotes on the margin as his authority, says some thing very different. He tells us that Edward did intend to pass the river by the bridge, which, on his arrival, he found had been already destroyed by the Scots, that all passage thereby might be cut off. Baulked in his expectation, \" Edward pitched his tents and prepared for dinner, when John Comyn approached on the opposite bank with the whole power of the Scots ; upon whose appearance the English army, seizing their arms, mounted their horses, and with these the king himself, entering the river, found, by the direction of the Lord, a ford for himself and his soldiers.\" Edward, therefore, whose prudence Lord Hailes commends, because he did not imitate the impetuous Cressingham, had actually intended to follow his example, and pass the river by the bridge ; and the Scots, whom he represents as fondly imagining he would do so, evidently entertained no such idea, because they burnt the bridge to prevent him from passing the river. Letter R, page 193. Much as I respect the ability of Dr Lingard, I cannot altogether acquit him of prejudice in his narrative of Scottish affairs. Speaking,"], [480, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 472 p. 328, vol. iii., of the conditions offered by Edward to Comyn, the Bishop of Glasgow, Sir Simon Fraser, and the rest, he adds, \u2014 \" When the rest of his countrymen made their peace with England, his (that is, Wallace's) interests were not forgotten. It was agreed, that he also might put himself on the pleasure and grace of the king, if he thought proper;\" and he adds this note \u2014 \"Et quant a Monsieur Guilliam de Galeys est accorde qu'il se mette en la volunte, et en la grace notre le Seigneur le Roi, si lui semble que bon soit.\" Lord Hailes, \" thinks it doubtful, whether the words * si lui semble ' refer to Wallace or the king ; but they evidently refer to Wallace. The offer is made in the same manner to the Bishop of Glasgow, the Steward, &c. 'si lour semble que bon soit.'\" By these expressions of the historian, the reader might be led to believe, that Edward's conduct to his Scottish rebels was not ungenerous or harsh ; and that to Wallace, the same, or nearly the same, terms were offered as to the rest of his countrymen. This is the impression made by the words, \" it was agreed that he also,\" and by the observation, \" the offer is made in the same manner.\" But it is proved by a state paper pub lished in Prynne's Edward the First, pp. 1119, 1120, that to Comyn, the Bishop of Glasgow, Sir Simon Fraser, and the rest, Edward expressly stipulated, \"that their life and limbs should be safe \u2014 that they should not suffer punishment or lose their estates \u2014 and that the ransom they should pay, and the fines to be levied on them for their misdemeanors, should be referred by>them to the good pleasure of the king.\" This last condition related only to Comyn, and those who surrendered themselves along with him. Wishart the Bishop of Glasgow, Sir Simon Fraser, James the Steward of Scotland, John Soulis, and a few others, were promised security for life and limb, freedom from imprisonment, and that they should not lose their lands ; but, according to their degrees of guilt in Edward's mind, a fine of more or less extent, and a banishment for a longer or shorter time, was inflicted on them ; which conditions they were to accept, no doubt, \" if to them seemed proper ; \" \"si lour semble que bon soit.\" And what, by the same authentic deed, was promised to Wallace ? The terms were, an unconditional surrender of himself to the will and mercy of the king, terms which every man knows were almost equiva lent to a declaration, that he was doomed to be executed the moment he was taken ; and yet Dr Lingard gravely tells us, \" Wallace's interests were not forgotten.\" Had he turned to Langtoft, p. 324, he would have found, that Wallace did, like the rest, propose to surrender himself, on the assurance of safety in life, limbs, and estate ; but that Edward cursed him by the fiend for a traitor, and set a price of three hundred marks on his head. This was an"], [481, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 473 attention to his interests with which, we may presume, he would willingly have dispensed. Letter S, page 198. The best, and evidently the most authentic, accounts of this memorable siege, are to be found in Langtoft's Chronicle, in Heming ford, Trivet, and Walsingham. Math. Westminster, in his turgid work, entitled the Flowers of History, has given us a lengthy narra tive, interwoven with speeches of his own composition, which he puts into the mouth of Edward. The last scene of the surrender of Olifant is in King Cambyses' vein ; but there is a great want of keeping in Mathew's composition. Edward, on receiving the sup pliants, and hearing their appeal to his mercy, tells them, it is his pleasure that they should be hanged and quartered ; after which he bursts into tears. The names of the leaders in this defence of Stirling are preserved in Rymer.

The fact, that Wallace's four quarters were sent to different parts of Scotland and England, is mentioned by most ancient historians ; but I find the notice of the towns to which they were sent in the MS. Chron. of Lanercost, a valuable historical relic, preserved in the library of the British Museum, (Cotton Library, Claudian,"], [482, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 474 D. vii. Art. 13,1) some extracts from which were communicated by Mr Ellis to Dr Jamieson. See Preliminary Remarks to Wallace, p. 12. This is the passage\u2014 \"Captus suit Willelmus Waleis per unum Scottum, scilicet per Dominum Johannem de Mentiphe, et usque London ad Regem adductus, et adjudicatum suit quod trahe retur, et suspenderetur, et decollaretur, et membratim divideretur, et quod viscera ejus comburerentur, quod factum est ; et suspensum est caput ejus super pontem London, armus autem dexter super pontem Novi Castri super Tynam, et armus sinister apud Berwicum, pes autem dexter apud villam Sancti Johannis, et pes sinister apud Aberdene.\" Fol. 211. See also \"Illustrations of Scottish History,\" p. 54, edited by Joseph Stevenson, Esq., a valuable work presented to the Maitland Club, by Mr Steven of Polmadie. Letter U, page 202. Lord Hailes was fond of displaying his ingenuity in whitewashing dubious characters ; and his note upon Sir John Menteith is an instance of this. He represents the fact, that his friend Menteith betrayed Wallace to the English, as founded upon popular tradition, and the romance of Blind Harry, Wallace's rhyming biographer ; whom, he adds, every historian copies, but none but Sir Robert Sibbald ventures to quote ; and, in his Corrections and Additions, he observes, that \" his Apology for Menteith has been received with wonderful disap probation by many readers, because it contradicts vulgar traditions, and that most respectable authority, Blind Harry.\" In reply to this it may be observed, that the fact of Wallace being betrayed and taken by Sir John Menteith is corroborated by a mass of ancient historical authority, both from English and Scottish writers, superior to what perhaps could be brought for most other events in our history ; and that as these writers lived long before Blind Harry, he may have copied from them, but it is impossible they could have copied from him. I shall shortly give the English and Scottish autho rities for the fact, and leave the reader to make his own inferences. We have already seen, from the last note, that the Chronicle of Lanercost Priory, a valuable MS. of the thirteenth century, preserved in the British Museum, Claudian D. vii. 13, and now printed by the Maitland Club, has this passage : \u2014 \"Captus suit Willelmus Waleis per unum Scottum, scilicet per Dominum Johannem de Mentiphe, et usque London ad Regem adductus, et adjudicatum suit quod trahere tur, et suspenderetur, et decollaretur.\" 2 We cannot be surprised 1 Since printed by the Maitland Club, and one of their most valuable works. 2 Chronicle of Lanercost, p. 203."], [483, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 475 that Lord Hailes should have been ignorant of this passage, as he tells us, Annals, vol. ii. p. 316, he had not been able to discover where the MS. Chronicle of Lanercost was preserved. The next piece of evidence, of Menteith's having seized Wallace, is contained in Leland's extract from an ancient MS. Chronicle, which Hailes has elsewhere quoted. I mean the Scala Chronicle, preserved in Corpus Christi Library, Cambridge. 1 In Leland's Collect, vol. i. p. 541, we have tliis passage from the Chronicle : \u2014 \" Wylliam Waleys was taken of the Counte of Menteth about Glaskow, and sent to King Edward, and after was hangid, drawn, and quarterid, at London.\" This is Leland's translation of the passage, which in all probability is much more full and satisfactory in the original. Yet it is quite satis factory as to Menteith's guilt. The next English authority is Langtoft's Chronicle, which Hailes has himself quoted in his Notes and Corrections, vol. ii. p. 346. It is curious, and, as to Menteith's guilt, perfectly conclusive : \u2014 Sir Jon of Menetest sewed William so nelii, He took him when he wend lest, on nyght his leman bi ; That was thorght treson of Jak Schort his man ; He was the encheson, that Sir Jon so him nam. \u2014 P. 32!). We learn from this, that Sir John Menteith prevailed upon Wallace's servant, Jack Short, to betray his master ; and came, under cover of night, and seized him in bed, \" his leman by,\" and when he had no suspicion of what was to happen. How Hailes, after quoting this passage, which was written more than two centuries before Blind Harry, should have presented this poor minstrel as the only original authority for the guilt of Menteith, is indeed difficult to determine. Fordun, who must have been born in the earlier part of the reign of Robert the First, received materials for his history from Wardlaw bishop of Glasgow. This prelate died in 1386. Say that Fordun concluded his history in 1370, ten years before Wardlaw's death, it will follow that it was ninety-four years before the poem of Blind Harry, the date of whose poem is somewhere about 1470. Let us hear how he speaks of the death of Wallace : \u2014 \"Anno Domini M.CCCV., W'illelmus Wallace per Johannem de Menteth fraudulenter et prodicionaliter capitur, Regi Angli\u00e6 traditur, Londoniis demembratur.\" Vol. iv. p. 996. Winton, against whose credit as a historical authority Hailes could not possibly have objected, finished his Chronicle in 1418, fifty-two 1 Since printed by the Maitland Club. The passage will be found, p. 126."], [484, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 476 years before Blind Harry's poem was written. Yet Winton thus speaks of the capture of Wallace, vol. ii. p. 130 : \u2014 \" A thousand thre hundyr and the fyft yere Ester the byrth of our Lord dere, Schyre Jon of Menteth in tha dayis Tuk in Glasco Willame Walays.\" And the chapter where this is mentioned is entitled \u2014 Quhen Jhon of Menteth in his dayis, J)issawit gud Willame Walays. Bower, the continuator of Fordun, and who possessed his manu scripts, was born in 1385, and is generally believed to have published his continuation about 1447, sixty-two years before Blind Harry's poem. He preserves, however, the very words of his master, Fordun, as to the guilt of Menteith, and afterwards refers to him in some additions of his own, as the acknowledged traitor who had seized Wallace. Vol. ii. pp. 229, 243. With these authors \u2014 Fordun, Winton, and Bower \u2014 Lord Hailes was intimately acquainted. He has, indeed, quoted the last of them, Bower, on the margin. He must have known that they were dead before the author of the Metrical Romance of Wallace was born. Annals, vol. i. p. 281. And yet he labours to persuade the reader that the tale of Wallace's capture by Menteith rests on the single and respectable authority of Blind Harry ! He has also remarked, that he has yet to learn that Menteith had ever any intercourse or friend ship and familiarity with Wallace. Whether there was any friendship or familiarity between Menteith and Wallace is not easily discovered, and is of little consequence ; yet that Menteith acted in concert with Wallace, and must therefore have had intercourse with him, is proved by the following passage from Bower, preserved in the Relationes Arnaldi Blair :\u2014 \" In hoc ipso anno (1298) viz. 28 die mensis Augusti, Dominus Wallas, Scoti\u00e6 custos, cum Johanne Grahame, et Johanne de Menteith, militibus necnon, Alexandro Scrymgeour, Constabulario vill\u00e6 de Dundee et vexillario Scoti\u00e6, cum quinquagentis militibus armatis, rebelles Gallovidienses punierunt, qui Regis Angli\u00e6 et Cuminorum partibus sine aliquo jure steterunt.\" ' Having given these authorities, all of them prior to Blind Harry, 1 Dr Jamieson, in his Notes on Wallace, p. 403, has ably combated the scepticism of Hailes as to Menteith. The above passage is quoted from the Relationes Arnaldi Blair, and seems to have been a part of Bower's additions to Fordun."], [485, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 477 it is unnecessary to give the testimony of the more modern writers. The ancient writers prove incontestably, that Sir John de Menteith, a Scottish baron, who had served along with and under Wallace against the English, deserted his country, swore homage to Edward, and employed a servant of Wallace to betray his master into his hands ; that he seized him in bed, and delivered him to Edward, by whom he was instantly tried, condemned, and hanged. Yet all these circumstances are omitted by Lord Hailes, who appears surprised that vulgar tradition should continue from century to century to execrate the memory of such a man. Dr Lingard, in his History of England, vol. iii. pp. 328, 329, has attempted to diminish the reputation of Wallace. He remarks, that he suspects he owes his celebrity as much to his execution as to his exploits ; that of all the Scottish chieftains who deserved and experienced the enmity of Edward, he alone perished on the gallows ; and that on this account his fate monopolized the sympathy of his countrymen, who revered him as the martyr of their indepen dence ; he represents the accounts of his strength, gallantry, and patriotic efforts, as given by Scottish writers who lived a century or two after his death, and who, therefore, were of no credible authority ; and he concludes with an eulogy on the clemency of Edward, who did not forget the interests of Wallace when the rest of his countrymen made their peace with England. These observations will not bear examination ; for, first, it is a mistake to say, that of all the Scottish chieftains who deserved Edward's enmity, Wallace was the only one who perished on the gallows. Sir Nigel Bruce, Sir Christopher Seton, John Seton, the Earl of Athole, Sir Simon Fraser, Sir Herbert de Morham, Thomas Boys, Sir David Inchmartin, Sir John de Somer ville, Sir Thomas and Sir Alexander Brace, both brothers of the king, and Sir Reginald Crawfurd, were all hanged by Edward's orders in the course of the year 1306, within a year of the execution of Wallace.1 So utterly untenable is the ground on which Dr Lingard has founded his conjecture, that Wallace owes his celebrity \" to his execution.\" His next remark is equally unfortunate. The writers who have given us an account of the exploits of Wallace did not live, as he imagines, a century or two after his death. John de Fordun, whom the historian, in his note on p. 328, includes amongst these writers, was born, as we have said, early in the reign of King Robert Bruce. He certainly received materials for his history from Bishop Wardlaw, who died in 1386. If we suppose that he began his history thirty years before, and that he was thirty years old when he commenced 1 See supra, p. 226-236 inclusive."], [486, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 478 writing, this will give us 1326 for the year of his birth. So that Fordun was horn twenty-one years after Wallace's execution. Even in the most favourable possible way in which the calculation can be taken, Fordun wrote his history only eighty-one years after Wallace's execution; and taking fifty as the average life, it will follow he was born only thirty-one years after that event. Winton finished his history in 1418. He was born probably not more than fifty or sixty years after Wallace's death, and might have received his information from old men who had known him. As to Dr Lingard's praise of the clemency of Edward towards Wallace, the unsubstantial grounds on which it is founded have been already noticed j1 but I cannot help remarking, that this historian's whole account of Wallace does little justice to this great man. He begins by throwing a doubt over his early history. \" Historians conjecture,\" he says, \" that Wallace was born at Paisley ; and they assert, that his hostility to the English originated more in the necessity of self-preservation than the love of his country. He had committed a murder, and fled from the pursuit of justice to the woods.\" Such may be the vague assertion of the English historians ; but Bower, an excellent authority, intimates a contrary opinion. He asserts, that Wallace's hostility to the English arose from his despair at beholding the oppression of his relations and countrymen, and the servitude and misery to which they were subjected. Fordun a Goodal, vol. ii. p. 169. He next observes, that after the surprise of Ormesby the Justiciary, by Wallace and Douglas, other independent chieftains arose in diffe rent counties, who massacred the English, and compelled their own countrymen to fight under their standards. These other independent chieftains are unknown to the contemporary historians, English or Scottish. But they do not appear upon the stage without a use. On the contrary, they first multiply, like Falstaff's men in buckram, \" into numerous parties,\" and then act a principal part in the next sentence ; for the historian goes on to observe, \" that the origin and progress of these numerous parties had been viewed with secret satisfaction by the Steward of Scotland and \"Wishart the Bishop of Glasgow, who determined to collect them into one body, and to give their efforts one common direction. Declaring themselves the assertors of Scottish independence, they invited the different leaders to rally around them ; and the summons was obeyed by Wallace and Douglas, by Sir Alexander Lindsay, Sir Andrew Moray, and Sir Richard Lundy.\" Vol. iii. p. 305. This last sentence has not, as far as I can 1 Page 471, note R."], [487, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 479 discover, a shadow of historical authority to support it. The numerous independent parties and chieftains who rose in different counties ; the secret satisfaction with which they were contemplated by the Bishop of Glasgow and the High-steward ; their determination to collect them into one body, and to give them one common direction ; their declaring themselves the assertors of Scottish independence ; their summons to the different leaders to rally round them, and the prompt obedience of this summons by Wallace, Douglas, and the rest \u2014 are not facts, but the vivid imaginations of the historian : and the impres sion they leave on the mind of the reader appears to me to be one totally different from the truth. The Steward and the Bishop of Glasgow are the patriot chiefs under whom Douglas and Wallace, and many other independent chieftains, consent to act for the recovery of Scottish freedom, and Wallace sinks down into the humble partisan, whose talents are directed by their superior authority and wisdom. Now, the fact was just the reverse of this. The Stewart and Wishart, encouraged by the successes of Wallace and Douglas, joined their party, and acted along with them in their attempt to free Scotland ; but neither Fordun,norWrinton, nor Bower,give us the slightest ground to think that they acted a principal part, or any thing like a principal part, in organizing the first rising against Edward. On the contrary, these historians, along with Trivet and Walsingham, Tyrrel and Carte, ascribe the rising to Wallace alone, whose early success first caused him to be joined by Douglas, and afterwards by the Bishop and the Steward, along with Lindsay, Moray, and Lundy. Indeed, instead of playing the part ascribed to them by Dr Lingard, the patriotism of the Steward and the Bishop was of that lukewarm and short-lived kind which little deserves the name. It did not outlive eight weeks, and they seized the first opportunity to desert Wallace and the cause of freedom. The attack upon Ormesby the Justiciary took place some time in May 1297 ; and on the 9th of July of the same year did Bishop Wishart negotiate the treaty of Irvine, by which he and the other Scottish barons, with the single exception of Wallace, and Sir Andrew Moray of Bothwell, submitted to Edward. The historian's other hero, the High-steward, who is brought in to divide the glory with Wallace, was actually in the English service at the battle of Stirling ; and although he secretly favoured the Scottish cause, he did not openly join with his countrymen till he saw the entire destruction of Surrey's army. I may remark, in concluding this note, that the idea of an attack upon Wallace, and an eulogy of the clemency of Edward, was perhaps suggested by Carte, vol. ii. p. 290 ; but his clumsy and absurd argument is .discarded, and a more ingenious hypothesis is substituted in its place. On reading over"], [488, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 480 Hemingford again, I find one expression which may perhaps have had some weight with Dr Lingard. This historian says, speaking of Bruce, p. 120, that he joined the Bishop of Glasgow and the Steward, \" qui tocius mali fabricatores exstiterant.\" Yet this is inconsistent with his own account in p. 118, and is not corroborated, as far as I know, by any other historian. The reader will find some additional remarks in vindication of Menteith in my friend Mr. Napier's excellent Life of his great ancestor, the Inventor of the Logarithms, p. 527-534. Letter V, p. 216. A MS. in the Cottonian, Vitell. A xx, entitled, \" Historia Angli\u00e6 a Brato ad ann. 1348,\" has this passage : \" Anno 1306, Kal. Feb. Robertus de Brus ad regnum Scoti\u00e6 aspirans, nobilem virum, J. de Comyn, quod s\u00e6 proditioni noluit assentire, in Ecclesia fratrum minorum de Dumfres interfecit ; et in festo annuntiationis Virginis, gloriose in Ecclesia Canonicorum regularium de Scone, per Comi tissam de Bohan, se fecit in regem Scoti\u00e6 solemniter coronari. Nam germanus predicte comitisse, cui hoc officium jure hereditario com petebat, tune absens in Anglia morabatur. Hanc Comitissam eodem anno Angli ceperunt, et in quadam domuncula lignea super murum Castri Berwyki posuerunt, ut earn possent conspicere transeuntes.\" The original order of Edward for the imprisonment of the Countess of Buchan is to be found in Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. ii. p. 1014. Lord Hailes treats the tale of the Countess of Buchan's criminal passion for Bruce with ridicule. If, however, we admit the fact, that the Countess of Buchan, whose brother was in the English interest, and whose husband, according to Hemingford, vol. i. p. 221, was so enraged that he sought to kill her for her treason, did, alone and unaccompanied, repair to Scone, and there crown Bruce, it seems to give some countenance to the story of her entertaining a passion for the king. The circumstance that nothing of this second coronation is to be found in the Scottish historians, Barbour, Winton, or Fordun, rather confirms than weakens the suspicion. Letter W, page 227. \" Hanc autem Comitissam eodem anno ab Anglicis captam cum quidam perimere voluissent, non permisit rex, sed in domuncula quadam lignea super murum Castri Berewici posita est, ut possent earn transeuntes conspicere.\" Trivet, p. 342. \u2014 Lord Hailes, vol. ii. p. 10, has given an elaborate note, to prove the impossibility of there being any truth in Math. Westminster's assertion, p. 455, \" that the countess was in open day suspended at Berwick in a stone and iron chamber, formed like a crown, as a gaze to all passengers.\" He"], [489, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 481 quotes the order preserved in the F\u0153dera, vol. ii. p. 1014, and then observes, that it is inconsistent with the story related by Math. West minster. I confess that I can see no such inconsistency ; on the contrary, the one seems completely to corroborate the other. The place of confinement, as described in the express words of Edward, is \" to be a cage constructed in one of the turrets of the castle of Ber wick, latticed with wood, cross-barred, and secured with iron, in which the Chamberlain of Scotland, or his deputy, shall put the Countess of Buchan.\" Lord Hailes observes, that \" to those who have no notion of any cage but one for a parrot or a squirrel, hung out at a window, he despairs of rendering this mandate intelligible.\" I know not what called forth this querulous remark ; but any one who has observed the turrets of the ancient Scottish castles, which hung like cages, on the outside of the walls, and within one of which the countess's cage was to be constructed, will be at no loss to under stand the tyrannical directions of Edward, and the passage of Mathew Westminster. It is worthy of observation, that, in his text, Lord Hailes has wholly omitted to notice the severity of Edward the First to the Countess of Buchan, simply stating, that she was committed to close confinement in England, and characterizing Edward's orders as being ridiculously minute. Dr Lingard, vol. iii. p. 377, softens the severity of Edward by a supposition which appears to me to be inconsistent with the tone and spirit of Edward's order. Letter X, page 229. We know, by the evidence of a remission under the Great Seal, communicated by Mr Thomson, the Deputy-clerk-register, to Dr Jamieson, that the delivery of Sir Christopher Seton to the English was imputed to Sir Gilbert de 'Carrick, but, upon investigation, not altogether justly, \"minus juste ut verius intelleximus ;\" and the same remission proves, that the castle of Lochdon was, by the same knight, Sir Gilbert de Carrick, delivered into the hands of the English. Mr Thomson considers the remission as showing for certain that Sir Christopher had taken refuge in the castle of Lochdon, of which Sir Gilbert de Carrick was hereditary keeper ; but this is rather a strong inference than a certainty. The conjecture of the Statistical Account, vol. xi. No. 4. Parish of Urr, in favour of the castle of Loch Urr, seems to be supported by pretty plausible evidence. Letter Y, p. 231. Dr Lingard observes that some of them were murderers. I know not on what authority he uses the plural \" some of them.\" Sir Christopher de Seton, indeed, is represented by Hemingford, p. 219, VOL. I. 2 H"], [490, "482 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. as having slain Comyn's brother, Sir Robert; and Trivet, p. 345, points to the same thing in the sentence, \"usque Dumfries ubi quendam militem de parte Regis occiderat ; \" but the historians, Barbour and Fordun, say nothing of it ; and I suspect that all that can be proved against Seton, is the being present with Robert Bruce when he stabbed Comyn. Indeed, one MS. of Trivet says that Seton was condemned on account of a murder committed in a church with his consent. See Trivet, p. 345, and the various readings at the bottom. As to the others, I am not aware of a single act of murder which can be brought against them, on the authority either of English or of Scottish historians. The fealty sworn to Edward was extorted from them either by fetters, imprisonment, confiscation, or the fear of death. Letter Z, page 255. Lord Hailes has been misled by Rymer, who has erroneously placed a deed entitled \" Gilbertus Comes Gloucestrie Capitaneus pro Expeditione Scoti\u00e6,\" on the 3d December, 1309, instead of 1308. He conjectures that the siege was raised. We may, perhaps, infer the contrary, from the orders issued by Edward, on the 12th of May, 1309, to most parts of England, and to Ireland also, to provide corn, malt, peas, beans, and wine, for his various castles in Scotland ; and, in the enumeration of these, Rutherglen is not included. The castles mentioned are, Berwick, Roxburgh, Stirling, Edinburgh, Banff, Perth, Dundee, Dumfries, Caerlaverock, and Ayr. Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, m. x. p. 63. Forfar is also mentioned, in a document dated 3d December, 1308, as being at the time in possession of the English. Letters AA, p. 271. Hume has mistaken the numbers of the English army who fought at Bannockburn, and has been corrected by Hailes, vol. i. p. 41. Dr Lingard has remarked, that it is impossible to ascertain the exact numbers of Edward's army. He says the most powerful earls did not attend ; but he has omitted the fact, that although they did not come in person, they sent their knights to lead their vassals into the field, and perform their wonted services. We may infer from the mention, in the English historians, of the absence of the Earls of Warwick, Surrey, Arundel, and Lancaster, that if any of the other barons or counties had neglected to send their powers, they would have noted the circumstance. The number given by Tyrrel, vol. iii. p. 260, is a hundred thousand men ; and it is probable that this is rather under than above the fact."], [491, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 483 Letters B B, page 275. Position of the Scottish army at the Battle of Bannockburn. By Donald Campbell, Lieut. H.P. 57th Regiment. The Rev. Mr M'Gregor, in his Statistical Account of Stirlingshire, published a plan of the battle of Bannockburn, drawn by a military engineer, in which the left wing of the Scottish army is made to rest on a small brook at St Ninians, and the right below Grey-stael, on a small brook which runs into the Bannock. Mr Tytler, in his History of Scotland, represents the line as drawn in the same direction ; but, as this would have been a bad position, in a military point of view, and as it does not agree with his own description of the field, I respectfully beg leave to submit to his consideration my objections to that position, and my reasons for believing that the Scottish army, at the battle of Bannockburn, was drawn up in a totally different direction. 1. The above position does not cover Stirling castle, the relief of which was the primary object of the English army.1 2. The front of the above position is not \" covered \" by any \" marshes.\" 3. Neither the small brook at St Ninians, the small brook at Grey stael, nor even the river Bannock itself, (any where above Milton,) could have presented a serious obstacle to the passage of an army in the month of June. The front and flanks of the Scottish army would have been, therefore, wholly unprotected ; so that the English army would not have been \" confined by the nature of the ground ; \" but, on the contrary, might have extended itself freely along the whole front of the Scottish line, and far beyond both its flanks. 4. The above position, instead of being unfavourable, would have been every way favourable for the evolutions of cavalry ; the whole ground in its front being hard and firm, and no where too steep for a charge. Indeed, the steep parts of the field are mere sloping banks and would run not parallel with, and in front of, but at right angles to the line of battle. 5. The Coxe-hill and the Gillie's-hill are separated from one another by a deep syke,2 and a narrow plain, which was intersected, until within these few years, with quagmire bogs, and rough with trees and underwood. This syke and plain would be at right angles to the 1 The reader is requested to keep before him the accompanying sketch of the ground. s \" A rill or rivulet, one that is usually dry in summer.\" \u2014 Jamieson."], [492, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 484 right centre of the Scottish army, thus exposing it to the certainty of being attacked separately, and cut off from the main body ; a military blunder of the most fatal tendency. 6. The bored stone which marks the station of the Bruce's standard, and the small holm on which De Bohun fell, are half a mile in front of any part of the above position. Would the Brace fix his standard, and station himself, for the purpose of forming his line, half a mile in front of his line of battle 1 1 Taking these objections into consideration, I feel satisfied that the above was not the position of the Scottish army at the battle of Ban nockburn ; but that, on the contrary, it was formed on the declivity which runs along the east side of the marshes of Halbert and Milton ; with its left flank resting on the Bannock, at the bend east of Milton mill, and its right on the south end of the deep syke which winds round the west and north base of Coxe-hill. I am the more con vinced of this, because the position agrees in every particular with the historical features of the field of battle as described by Mr Tytler in his History of Scotland. 1. The river Bannock, from the bend east of Milton mill, runs through a deep and rugged ravine, which could not be passed by the English in the face of the Scottish army. This ravine terminates at the carse below the village of Bannockburn, where Clifford (in the sketch) is represented to have crossed the river with his plump of spears. But although a small party might have effected a passage over the river, with the assistance of the doors, &c, (which, if I recollect Barbour's statement, are said to have been furnished for that purpose the night before, by the governor of Stirling castle,) yet it is not likely that large masses could have done so, otherwise the English columns might have marched over the carse and relieved the castle ; thus terminating the truce before striking a blow at Bannock burn. There is no reason to doubt, therefore, that the carse was at that time a perfect marsh, altogether incapable of being traversed by an army. Hence, considering the character of the ravine, (and sup posing the carse, thence to the Forth, incapable of being marched over by the English columns,) the left flank of the Scottish army, resting on that ravine at the bend east of Milton mill, could not be turned. 2. There was a deep syke and a narrow plain, (the surface of which, until within these few years, was intersected with quagmire bogs, and rough with trees and underwood,) running north between the Gillie 1 The ancient ford over the Bannock, and the spot where De Bohun fell, are marked with a * on the hand-sketch of the field ; and the bored stone, in the centre of the Bruce's reserve, is also marked on it with an 0 (see Sketch.)"], [493, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 485 and the Coxe-hills. Hence, the right flank of the Scottish army, supposing it to rest upon the south end of that syke, could not be turned. 3. The Gillie's-hill is divided by a deep hollow, which runs through the middle of it from east to west. Here the undisciplined or inferior clans were placed in ambush. The word Gillie, which is now under- stood to mean a half-grown boy, or a callan, was of old applied to every person subordinate to, or in attendance upon, a gentleman. An army subordinate to another army, might, in the more ancient sense of the word, be called the army of \" Gillies.\" John Lorn applies the word to a party of M'Donalds, who were employed to avenge the murder of Keppoch in the seventeenth century. He describes them as \" a lofty banner of black-headed Gillies.\" In a state of society where all men carried arms, it may easily be conceived that 20,000 Gillies might have constituted a force of no small value in the hands of such a leader as Bruce. The right flank of the army of Gillies is represented in the sketch as resting upon a perpendicular rock, which is separated by a ravine from the Campsie or Monteith range of hills ; and its left flank is represented as resting upon a rock, which is now opened up as a quarry, and which rises from the west side of the quagmire plain already described. There is no part of the order of the battle which I consider more worthy of admiration than the disposition of the in- ferior clans, or Gillies. They appear to have been formed in such a position as would have enabled them, upon a given signal, to rush down upon the rear and left flank of the English army ; and thus, by their sudden appearance, to create such an effect as could not fail to check its advance or to precipitate its retreat. In short, the Bruce, strange to say, had evidently made the same use of his inferior troops at Bannockburn, which the Duke of Wellington generally made of his Spanish auxiliaries during the Peninsular war ; thus anticipating, by five hundred years, a remarkable feature in the tactics of that illustrious leader. I cannot part with this feature of the Bruce's order of battle, without remarking upon the consideration and skill with which the position of the Gillies was chosen, not only with a view to their efficient co-operation with the main army, but also with a strict regard to their own safe retreat, in the event of the defeat of both. The Campsie or Monteith range of hills, which is of easy access by the south side of the Gillie's-hill, would \u2014 in case of their descent upon, and defeat by, the left wing of the English army \u2014 lie within a few hundred paces in their rear ; and there is no doubt, that the natural instinct of undisciplined mountaineers would lead every one of them, in the panic of a defeat, to fly to these fastnesses, where they would not only be perfectly inaccessible to pursuit, but where they might"], [494, "486 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. also rally and prove a most efficient check upon the advance of the English army, (by hovering upon its flanks along the ridge of these hills,) should the main body of the Scottish army find itself compelled to retire upon the ford of Frew, which would, no doubt, have been the direction of their retreat, had they lost the battle. 4. The old Torwood road (which, so far as I could learn, was of old the only road from the south to Stirling) crossed the Bannock by a ford, (the traces of which are still visible, and which I have marked with a * upon the sketch,) and thence over the hard ground between the marshes of Halbert and Milton, and by the bored stone on Caldon hill. The face of that hill, between these marshes, may, therefore, be regarded as the key of the Bruce's position. According to the uniform and time-honoured tradition of the district, his standard was fixed on this part of the position ; and he slew De Bohun in the centre of the little holm before it. The Bannock, from the south end of Milton marsh to a considerable distance above the ford, runs between two deep banks of earth, over a soft bottom. It is extremely probable, therefore, that the vanguard of the English army had found it neces sary to halt upon the south bank of the river, while making the necessary dispositions for crossing the ford, and that De Bohun, in the interval, dashed over it and menaced the Bruce ; who is described by Barbour as riding in front of his army, forming his line of battle. Barbour, I think, distinctly states that the Bruce \" advanced \" to meet him. Supposing the Bruce to have been in the front of the key of his position, between the marshes, and De Bohun to have been in the front of the English vanguard, on the north side of the ford, when the signal of defiance passed between them, each had a career of about two hundred paces to the spot where the latter fell. It appears, there fore, that this was an affair of pure chivalry, proceeding upon an open defiance, given and accepted, and ending in a regular tilt half-way between both armies. In my humble opinion, however, it may be charged upon the spirit of the age rather than the indiscretion of the Bruce. Had he shrunk from the offered encounter, it would have afforded a triumph to the enemy, and might have done violence to the feeling of romantic heroism cherished by his own army. 5. The continued treason of some of the Scottish nobility, and the bad faith not unfrequently exhibited by the leaders of the English army, were such, that I have no doubt a corps of observation was stationed on Coxe-hill, the moment the army was placed in position, for the purpose of protecting its rear against the incursions of any hostile clan, or any breach of the truce on the part of the governor of Stirling castle. Clifford, by sweeping round the hills on the south of the river Bannock, and crossing below the bank which"], [495, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 487 bounds the carse on the west, appears to have escaped notice until he ascended the table land east of St Ninians. It is evident, therefore, that no corps of infantry, withdrawn from any part of the Scottish line, could possibly be in time to intercept him, at the place marked out by the stone pillars as the scene of the conflict between himself and Randolph. The inference, that the corps by which he was intercepted had been stationed on the east side of the Coxe-hill, is, therefore, inevitable. Indeed, Barbour himself affords some counte nance to this inference, by stating, that Randolph went \" down \" to intercept Clifford ; there being no ground in the vicinity higher than the place upon which they fought, excepting Coxe-hill. Note. \u2014 The banks of the deep syke, along the west base of Coxe-hill, were being levelled, and the marshes of Halbert and Milton drained, when my friend, Mr Archibald Leckie of Paisley, and myself visited the field. We had thus the gratifying opportunity' of seeing the field before these prominent historical features were smoothed down or obliterated. We were also present while the drainers were throwing open the pits, mentioned by Barbour, at the west end of the Halbert marsh. I have no doubt that the whole space in front of the line, from that marsh to the syke, was covered with these pits ; at least they were found to extend as far in that direction as the drains had then been carried. The whole front of the Scottish position was thus covered, and rendered inaccessible to a charge of cavalry by the Bannock, the marshes, and these ingeniously constructed pits. In deed, I am also of opinion, that the front of the schiltrons were kept at such an exact distance behind the Bannock, the marshes, and the pits, as to render it necessary for the archers to be detached from the English masses, and to pass over to the Scottish side of these defences, before they could have produced any serious effect on the Scottish armv ; and that to this circumstance is to be ascribed the facility with which they had been swept from the field by the handful of cavalry employed in that service. Had they been on the same side of these defences as the English men-at-arms, their immediate and complete destruction, by so inadequate a force, would be incompre hensible. The pits consisted of circular holes about eighteen inches deep, very close to one another, with a sharp pointed stake in the centre of each. The stakes were in a state of decomposition, and offered no resistance to the spade ; but the bark was sufficiently entire to enable us to see that they had been made chiefly of hazel. There were some swords, spear-heads, horse shoes, horse hair, (the latter generally mixed with a whitish animal matter resembling tallow,) found in them."], [496, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 488 Letters CC, page 373. The leonine verses, called Bruce's Testament, are as follows : \u2014 \" Scotica sit guerra pedites, mons, mossica terra : Silv\u00e6 pro muris sint, arcus et hasta, securis.

In the present volume, the reader will find many references to the Accounts of the Great Chamberlains of Scotland. Two large quarto volumes of these accounts, which contain all that is yet printed, were politely communicated to me by Mr Thomson, the present clerk register, to whose learning and enthusiasm the legal antiquities of the country are under deep obligations. Neither of these volumes has as yet been published, as the Preface and Appendix to he sub joined to each is not yet printed ; but, when completed, the work will be one of the most valuable which has ever been presented to the student of the history and antiquities of his country. The accounts, indeed, are written in Latin, and, from the innumerable contractions, present themselves in a shape somewhat repulsive to the general reader ; but they contain a mass of information upon the state of ancient Scotland, its early agriculture, commerce, manufactures, and upon the manners and habits of the people, which is in a high degree * In the translation of \" securis,\" I have adopted Ridpath's conjecture. \u2014 Border History, p. 290."], [497, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 489 interesting and important.

Even within the small limits of this extract, it will be seen that much curious and interesting information is to be found. The prices of grain, and the quantities furnished for the consumption of the royal household at Cardross, (it will be recollected that Robert Bruce spent there the two last years of his life, 1328, 1329 ;) the prices of the pro visions for the larder, which consisted of marts, sheep, salted salmon, and numerous other articles not in this extract, enable us to form a pretty correct idea of the mode of living at this time. From the next passage, we are not only able to glean some information as to the state of the necessary and ornamental arts, but we obtain, at the same time, an interesting view of the occupations of this great king during the last year of his life. We see him and his illustrious nephew, Randolph, employing their rural leisure in experiments in ship building and navigation, although the circumstance, that one of the king's great ships could be hauled from the firth to the running stream (rivulem) beside the manor of Cardross, gives us a very contemptible idea of the size of these vessels. The house for the king's hawks, and the expenses paid for the journey of Patrick the Fool, from England to Tarbet, are examples of the entries in these records which throw light on the manners of the times. Of the obscure sen tence regarding the house which was constructed \"ad opus culqu hanorum domini regis,\" I am unable to give any explanation, in addi tion to the conjecture in the note ; but innumerable other passages might be selected, which would prove the high interest and value of these Accounts. The first volume contains 543 pages, and its contents, as described in page 2, are as follows : \u2014 1. The Preface to the volume, with an Appendix. 2.

The third volume contains the accounts of the Great Chamber lains of Scotland, and some other officers of the kingdom, from 1406 to 1435. Letters EE, page 386. Death of Randolph. Barbour, the metrical historian of Brace, whose work is of the highest authority, informs us that Randolph was poisoned, without adding any particulars. The lave sa weill mantenyt he, And held in pess swa the countre, That it wes nevir or his day Sa weill, as I herd auld men say. Bot syne, allace ! pusonyt ices he ; To see his dede was gret pite. \u2014 Barboub, p. 423. Barbour is generally believed to have been born about 1316, and, according to Lord Hailes' conjecture, was fifteen years old at the period of the death of Randolph. On what grounds are we entitled to set aside such an authority ? Winton is supposed, by his able editor, Macpherson, to have been born about the year 1350, (Preface to Winton's Chronicle, p. 19,) only eighteen years after the death of Randolph. He composed his Chronicle in his old age, having commenced it in 1 420, and finished it in 1424. (Ibid. p. 22.) His account is as follows : \u2014 Tharefore with slycht thai thoct to gere Him wyth wenenous fell poysown Be destroyid, and fel tresown"], [500, "492 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. And that thai browcht s'wn til endyng Be swn tresownabil wndertakyng ; For at the Wemyss, by the se, Poysownyd at afest was he. \u2014 Vol. ii. p. 146. This is clear and direct testimony also. Let us next turn, not to Fordun, for he omits all mention of the circumstance ' of the poison- ing, and simply states the death of the Regent ; but to his continuator, Bower, who, as we learn from himself, was born fifty-three years after the death of Randolph,2 in the year 1385. \" Et ideo,\" says he, speaking of the designs of the disinherited barons against Randolph, \" novam artem confixerunt, et ut Italici ferunt, hello tradimento verius viii effecerunt, ut quidam Anglicus religione corruptus dicto custodi familiaris capellanus, sibi venenum in vino propinaret. Quod et factum est ut supra.\" Lord Hailes, in opposition to these autho- rities, pronounces the story of the death of Randolph by poison to be a silly popular tale, and affirms that he was afflicted in the decline of life with a confirmed stone ; that in the progress of the disease he became gradually worse, was seized with cholic pains, and at length died. But this circumstance of Randolph being afflicted with the stone, as well as the minute detail of the progress of the disease, on which Lord Hailes' whole theory proceeds, is not supported by an atom of authentic evidence. It rests solely on the authority of Hector Boece, whom Lord Hailes, in almost every page represents, and truly represents, as a romancer, who is unworthy of all credit. Barbour, Winton, and Bower, say not a word of it, but describe Randolph as being in the active discharge of his duties as governor, when he was suddenly cut off by the treachery of his enemies. Why, then, should the historian adopt the story of an author whom none can trust, and whom, on other subjects, he never trusts himself, in preference to the positive averment of authentic writers ? As for poor Hector, he is treated rather cavalierly, being first compelled to act as an ally, and then summarily put down as a fabricator. In speaking of the Scot- tish historians, we must be careful to separate Boece and his followers from those who flourished before him. The last class, including Barbour, Winton, Fordun, and Bower, are valuable ; the first, full of invention and apocryphal details. For instance, Lord Hailes observes, that the Scottish historians pretend that Randolph was poisoned by a vagrant monk from England, and that this was executed with the knowledge of Edward the Third. Now, neither Barbour, nor Winton, as we see, say a word of Randolph being poisoned by a monk, far less an English monk ; and Fordun, although he lays 1 Fordun a Hearne, p. 1018. 2 Lib. xiv. chap. i."], [501, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 493 the crime on an English chaplain, does not allege that Edward was privy to the plot. Boece, however, and those who followed him, assert both facts. Letters FF, page 402. Death of Seton. Lord Hailes, in his Annals, has omitted the circumstance of Edward the Third having hanged the son of Sir Alexander Seton, reserving it as a historical problem, to be treated of in a separate dissertation. In that dissertation, given in the appendix, the fact of Seton's death is established beyond doubt ; yet, in future editions, the scepticism of the text is retained. The result of the dissertation is satisfactory in one way, as it proves that Winton and Fordun are corroborated, in every particular, by the narrative of the Scala Chronicle. Their account, also, of Seton being governor of the town, is confirmed by the testimony of the Chamberlains' Accounts. Letters GG, pages 404, 405. Battle of Halidon Hill. Extract from a MS.

Lord Hailes, (Annals, vol. ii. p. 218,) in his observations on the conduct of the Steward of Scotland at the battle of Durham, has this passage : \u2014 \" Boece, book xv. fol. 324, has been pleased to assert, that the Steward and the Earl of March, perceiving that the forces under their command were dispirited, and unwilling to fight any longer, withdrew them to a place of safety.\" He adds, \" that this retreat was the cause of all the disasters which ensued.\" He then observes, that the proper vindication of the Steward is, that the narrative of Boece, although not altogether of his own invention, has no warrant from Fordun, or from any English historian of considerable anti quity. I have no desire to support the character of Boece, the most apocryphal of all our historians ; but as I have differed entirely, in this part of the history, from the view given of this -battle by Lord Hailes, it is necessary to observe, that this has been done on authentic grounds ; and, first, it is to be observed, that Fordun's account of the battle of Durham, instead of giving no support to Boece, describes the flight of the Steward and the Earl of March in strong expres sions. \" Omnibus captis,\" says he, \" exceptis Patricio de Dunbar et Roberto Sever Scotis, qui fugam capientes ill\u00e6si abierant.\" \u2014 Fordun a Hearne, p. 1038. The Scala Chronicle, a contemporary English authority, from which Leland gave extracts in his Collectanea, and which has since been printed, also corroborates the account of For dun. \" The Counte of March and the Seneschal of Scotland fled.\" To say that the Steward fled from the field without striking a blow would be highly inaccurate, for we know from Winton that he sus tained great loss ; but that, seeing the day on every side going against them, he and the Earl of March effected their retreat without attempting to rescue the king, seems to be the fact ; and it is quite evident that David never forgave it.
