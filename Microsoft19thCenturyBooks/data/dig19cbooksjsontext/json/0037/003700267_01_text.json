KIRSTEN. jijifO^JlJiHE first impression which Kirsten Stewart's k\u00a7g! B\u00a7!g 'jcc oave was hardly that of gentleness. Bag|J-5%jj It rather conveyed the idea of truth. It was a face honest to bluntness. No one could imagine the frank though somewhat shy eyes beam ing with persuasive smiles, and the candid lips shaped to tell pleasant falsehoods. Kirsten Stewart's single-heartedness and loyalty were written on her face and spoken in her words, her exceeding tender ness had to be discovered in her actions. As for Kirsten's looks, apart from her feelings, she was a well-made, comely girl of twenty years of age, a bright looking though somewhat pale brunette, with rather a disproportionate weight of forehead to ordinary observers. To those who knew and loved her, she was very bonnie ; but it must be B"], [14, "Her Gentle Deeds. 2 confessed these partial persons mixed up spiritual\" and physical attractions in inextricable entangle ment in their regard. They could not see the big forehead apart from the heaven of peace which rested on it, or the full straight lips without beholding the sweet serenity which lay enfolded in the delicate curves. Lovable as Kirsten was, she resembled Wordsworth's Lucy in having very few to love her. Her way, too, had lain in paths all but untrodden till she had completed her twentieth year. Her great modesty, which formed one of her most dis tinguishing characteristics, with its common accom paniment, the strong reserve that was partly an individual, partly a national and inherited attribute, prevented her from being easily known, or likely to do herself justice in letting her sympathies and interests be directed to any great extent beyond her own household. Kirsten was the child of the old age of an excel lent couple, Scotch, but long forth of Scotland. Ensign Stewart had engaged himself when he was without a penny beyond the pay \u2014 barely sufficient for his maintenance \u2014 to a half-pay officer's equally penniless daughter. The engagement had lasted long enough to tire the patience and try the con stancy of any pair less simply devoted to each other ; and when promotion came it was still of the slenderest description. Yet, by the time Stewart saw himself gazetted captain without purchase, he"], [15, "Kirsten. 3 found himself disabled by the effects of hard knocking about and a succession of damaging climates from further active service with the hope of rising higher in his profession. He had to retire on half-pay, -which was, however, pittance enough for the loving elderly woman who had, during many a year, looked forward half-despairingly to her Dugald's becoming a captain on full pay as the summit of earthly prosperity, the opening of Elysium to her. But she could be content, happy as a cricket, under existing circumstances. It might have been hard for her to cope with the expenses of a regiment on the ample income, but when there was only Dugald and herself to be considered, and they could retire to some inexpensive town and arrange their household to suit their means, she could manage on next to nothing. She not only said it, she did it, keeping her husband out of debt, furnishing him with necessaries and a wonderful amount of comforts ; above all, charming him by her smile and by the one little daughter she bore him. The parents, in the honest dignity of their old fashioned ways, proudly gave to the child her ma ternal grandmother's old-fashioned name, according to time-honoured precedent. The name was once common in Scotland, while it always carried with it a Norse flavour and ring. The Stewarts dearly loved their baby, but they could not conceive her too good B 2"], [16, "Her Gentle Deeds. 4 for her good grandmother's name. Indeed, they thought this little Kirsten could not have a more honourable baptismal title. To their sensible Scotch ears fondly familiar words with a meaning in them and a reason for them were welcome. The racy were preferable to the sweet. Many of the last favourite English names \u2014 Ethels and Florences, Roses and Amys \u2014 sounded either fantastic or namby-pamby to the Stewarts, while what is called a fancy name was purely detestable to them. What ! name a little girl after nobody in particular, in contempt of all the brave, true women who have lived and died since the world began ! Deprive the innocent helpless infant of a kindly human, even when not a kindred, relation ! The Stewarts were a little matter-of-fact, but this conclusion implied to them a very bathos of matter-of-factness of which they were incapable. Years might have brought care for Kirsten, but a happily timed bequest of two thousand pounds from a wealthy bachelor cousin, on whose favour the couple had never counted, relieved them from all anxiety on their daughter's behalf. Two thousand pounds may appear a paltry sum to many people, but in Captain and Mrs. Stewart's eyes it seemed a very fair provision for their only child. It might serve her for a liberal dowry, or if she remained unmarried, the father and mother, who had been so easily suited and so happy on a narrow income, never doubted that the interest would be"], [17, "Kirsten. 5 sufficient to maintain according to her rank a gently born single lady, brought up quietly and plainly as Kirsten had been reared, so their minds were set at rest on this point. The girl was anything save self-indulgent. She had been trained by her mother to be a capital, practical housewife. She delighted in housewifely activities and achievements ; she was too much of a lady to dream that she could demean herself by them. She would rise at five o'clock in the summer mornings on occasions to save the expense of a gardener, and surprise the Captain, who had become too stiff to weed his plots and beds, or to clip their low box edging, by showing them all in apple-pie order at breakfast time. She always pulled the peas, the strawberries, and the gooseberries in the season ; she dusted the drawing-room and her father's study still more unfailingly. She could make her own bed as well as any amateur nurse could make a patient's bed in an hospital. She could let a new servant see how to cook nearly as well as any German girl could do it ; nay, Kirsten was undutifully proud, except, to be sure, that the mother exulted still more than the daughter in the fact when she surpassed the old lady in certain dishes, some of them the Captain's favourites ; Kirsten made a large proportion of her own and her mother's clothes, with the reservation of their best gowns, which neither of the ladies attempted to construct. But the younger trimmed"], [18, "Her Gentle Deeds. 6 all her mother's best caps as well as her own hats and bonnets. What she did for the Captain's head was to clip his grey hair once a month and take a kiss from him instead of a barber's fee. She could clear-starch to perfection, and her marketing was only second to Mrs. Stewart's. Withal, Kirsten's shapely young hands remained perfectly presentable, and her voice was as tuneful as if it had never engaged in a bargain. From the enumeration of Kirsten's performances, it may be easily guessed that the Stewarts had taken up their residence in a remote, primitive little town, where domestic economy and efficiency were still viewed as virtues which could be practised by gentle folks with advantage, without the least detriment or disgrace to the performers. Other families much in the same position in Haythorpe were as honour ably striving and industrious as the Stewarts showed themselves. Captain and Mrs. Stewart had not returned to Scotland and the Highlands for various reasons, one of them being the long expensive journey north, and the impossibility of the travellers ever flying south again after they took the first flight. They had made up their minds by a great effort to give up Lowland leas and Highland hills, broad belts of gleaming friths, long sinuous glittering lochs, foaming rivers, tinkling burns, the parish kirk and the parish school, the old songs and the old proverbs with all"], [19, "Kirsten. 7 their priceless associations. The heads of the house that was to be had resolved to settle in the peaceful little town of Haythorpe, in an out-of-the-way agri cultural county, where agricultural produce continued cheap in spite of railways, which for that matter did not approach within a radius of half-a-dozen miles ; milk, butter, eggs, and fowls, rent and domestic service, in the favoured locality, did not rise to above twice the price which Mrs. Stewart fondly remembered them in her district of the Highlands. She could keep house there on the Captain's half-pay. The neighbours, if they were a little rustic, and, what was worse, a little wild, a good many of them, in the old rough, reckless dissipation which is apt to linger longer in quarters to which skin-deep civilisation and superfine refinement have been slow to penetrate, were not wilder or rougher than members of the old Highland upper classes as the Stewarts had known them ; while both classes were, perhaps, more hospitable and friendly than more fastidious and scrupulous but less generous people are apt to prove. Upon the whole, the family did very well at Haythorpe, while neither husband nor wife ever yielded to the looser standards and coarser self indulgence around them. For this very reason, in addition to Captain and Mrs. Stewart's sterling uprightness and benevolence, they were much respected in the place, and Kirsten, as she grew up,"], [20, "8 Her Gentle Deeds. became a welcome figure among the not very numerous young people in the best houses of the town that hovered on the skirts of the nearest county gentry. Was not her father, the spare, active captain, an army man? a gallant officer who had fought for his country in China and India ? and was not her mother, the stout, cheerful matron, a lady born and bred, as well as an excellent house keeper ? though neither of the two had much to spare. In fact, any return which the Stewarts made to the town's hospitalities was necessarily of the most frugal description, and did not go beyond a rubber, with a glass of the Captain's good whisky toddy and a plate of short-bread for the old people, and a carpet dance with negus and sandwiches for the young. Really the unsophisticated disinterested ness of the cultivation of the Stewarts, by their town's people in Haythorpe, offered an example worthy of being copied in more precise and pre tentious circles. Kirsten's regular education had not been neglected \u2014 that was not likely where her father and mother were a well-bred Scotch couple of the old school. A little provincial town may seem a bad field for the education of youth, but it has its advantages. Kirsten, busy as she was, had always plenty of time. She found leisure to digest what she learned, she was not crammed with unsuitable fare, nor confused or mystified by a multitude of sciences with hosts of"], [21, "Kirsten. 9 details pressed upon her, before she was ready for them. She acquired the ordinary elements of reading, writing, and arithmetic, with the outlines of geo graphy and history, at a useful, harmless ladies' school. What she had gained was immediately im pressed on her and seemed to grow and fructify. She had to write portions of her mother's correspondence with friends at a distance, especially with a half sister in Australia, as well as letters on her own account to every girl friend who had \u2014 what never happened to Kirsten \u2014 quitted Haythorpe for a season. She had to help her father with his diary of the weather and the crops. She was early trained to keep accounts in a clear, correct fashion. She read aloud nearly every evening. There was a respectable library in the little town, from which the Stewarts had many of the standard books of all generations, which could not have been easily got from a modern book-club, and a few good new books. Through these, and through her father and mother's intimate acquaintance and sympathy with the most of them, Kirsten attained to a highly in telligent, and one may say a deeply affectionate, knowledge of English literature. Her father when he was quartered in French Canada had won a mastery over the French language, of which he was innocently vain. This he took pains to impart to his daughter. Her mother had"], [22, "Her Gentle Deeds. 10 something like a genius for music, and at one time in her life she had commanded a rare opportunity for the development of the gift. She had been brought into close temporary contact with a great German master. Mrs. Stewart had availed herself of the boon and could still bring forth from the old deficient piano, which had nevertheless been one of her most cherished household goods when she came to Hay thorpe, not merely \" Scots wha'^hae \" and \" The land o' the leal,\" but sonatas of Beethoven, and canzonets of Haydn as few who had not devoted their lives to them could render them. Kirsten had only a moderate share of her mother's talent in this respect, but what musical faculty she possessed was carefully and truly guided and made the most of. Drawing had been altogether omitted from her curriculum, neither her father nor her mother having had any special inclination or information in that line. This was a pity, for though a notion existed that Kirsten had inherited a defective sense of the perpendicular and of perspective, and this notion had prevented her from being put into the hands of the drawing-master \u2014 and he might have been an Old Crone \u2014 who represented that branch of art in her school, she had certainly a fine eye for colour, and a perfectly spontaneous original sense of what was harmonious and graceful in modelling, grouping, and lively action. Haythorpe was not so antediluvian as to fail to"], [23, "Kirsten. 11 \u2022employ an ex-sergeant for a drill-master, while it imported a peripatetic dancing-master to finish the physical education of its youth. Kirsten hardly needed them ; she had been taught to march, to square her shoulders and hold up her head, by her father. Her mother's musical bent had early de lighted in setting the child to dance in fit time and tune, with appropriate steps and gestures, to her gavottes and mazourkas, strathspeys and reels. Above all \u2014 for this was at once the core and crown of the girl's education \u2014 Kirsten had a fine mind and heart. It is not meant that she was exceptionally clever as men reckon cleverness, but she was in wonderfully true relation to the world around her, the world of nature and the world of humanity alike ; the world of the past, the present, the future. She could respond to multitudes of influences on all sides, spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The spring ing, sprouting, and earing of the corn, the forms and tints of trees, every growth in the garden \u2014 that of the humblest vegetable as well as the loveliest flower \u2014 a sunset, a rainbow, the fresh glitter of the dew, the silver of the hoar frost, the joyous note of a bird, the warning bark of a dog, the wistful low of a cow, each came to her with its own charm. In the same manner human life had endless interest for her. Withal, Kirsten Stewart was neither a prodigy of mental ability nor moral goodness, while she was more \u2022of the latter than the former. In intellect she had"], [24, "Her Gentle Deeds. 12 sound reason, something of bright wit, and certainly a wonderful amount of sympathy \u2014 that was the sum total and secret of her powers. But she could not have been so good as she was without being con sciously or unconsciously a deeply religious girl, though she was one of those with regard to whom the apostle wrote that they are a law unto them selves, and therefore she lived rather than thought, far less spoke, religion. She was, without speculat ing about it, at peace with God and man ; a human embodiment of the highest principles of Christianity \u2014 a humble, hearty, unquestioning follower of a Divine Master. Like her father and mother, Kirsten was decidedly respected and liked in Haythorpe. She was even depended upon, young as she was, in a way \u2014 a quiet, circumscribed way. But she was not at all widely known, or raved about, or yearned over, or passion ately prized except by her father and mother. Yet none was so happy at youthful gatherings, for she had little or no vanity to exact attention, and still less egotism to feel wounded if the attention which would only have troubled her was not paid to her ; none was so content \"out of company in the mingled freedom and manifold obligations and responsibilities of home, as gleeful as a child, ready to laugh at the smallest innocent jest, sometimes quaintly humorous in her close observation, diverted where other people were burdened or depressed or provoked. However,"], [25, "Kirsten . 13 this graciously rounded character was not constituted to be a popular heroine. Kirsten Stewart might slip through the world, serving it with her best all the time, and not be generally noticed ; not be gene rally missed when her unselfish, unobtrusive service was ended. Only to a few would she be incompar able, the pearl among women here, one of God's saints yonder."], [26, "CHAPTER II. CHANGES. llRSTEN STEWART'S peaceful youth came to a speedy, rather abrupt termina tion. Her father and mother died within a year of each other, without any prolonged break ing up of their health and habits. It was a terrible blow to the loving young creature to whom house hold affection and household duty had been so much. Yet she bore even sorrow characteristically : she said little about it, and did not cry out loudly against her orphan lot, as if she were singled out for misery. She showed her thankfulness for the happiness that was gone by accepting God's sentence, and by find ing her solace in striving through her lonely tears, as through her social smiles, to do her duty and His will. Yet the iron had entered into the tender soul. Kirsten looked half-a-dozen years older from that date, and although she continued to appear the young woman she was, she never regained the air of light-hearted girlishness, with not much to re member and still less to regret. For the stillness"], [27, "Changes. 15 of death was around Kirsten when she rose up and when she lay down. The emptiness of her house and heart and life was ever present with her. Of course Kirsten was not by any means without sympathisers and well-wishers in her native town. That last word exactly expressed their relation. They stood outside her life, outside her nature. They and she were on perfectly friendly terms, most willing to help each other, but it was at what one is tempted to call a polite distance, behind a barrier which could not be thrown down. She could no more help keeping herself and her sorrows largely to herself, till friends like her father and mother should come and claim their share in them, or till she should go to rejoin her oldest friends, than she could help refraining from sobs and tears. She was not a tearful woman ; only the bitterest crises of anguish wrung sobs and tears from her. In this light the gentlest of women was like a strong man. There was another Scotch family near Haythorpe. By a coincidence they were also Stewarts \u2014 branches of the same clan, though not from the same High land district, or counting any save a remote kinship with Captain Stewart's family. To these Kirsten's father and mother, with their strong nationality and lingering prejudice, had turned longingly when they desired friends for their daughter, and anticipated the day that she might want them in the rending"], [28, "16 Her Gentle Deeds. of nearer ties. But there had been some blindness in the selection, since there was no real resemblance and very little sympathy between the heads of the houses. Mr. Stewart, of Cope Hall \u2014 in proximity to the town \u2014 as distinguished from Captain Stewart, had come to the neighbourhood in the character of cham berlain to its largest proprietor \u2014 a very big man indeed, a duke in the peerage. The worldly great ness of his employer appeared to possess the spirits and turn the heads slightly of both Mr. Stewart and his wife \u2014 a handsome, dashing couple of the Roman nose, brilliant complexion, expanded chest, and long neck type. They had in full the Celtic susceptibility to outward influences. The couple were impressed by their reflected consequence as representatives of ducal power and magnificence, and fired by an ambition for their children, which they illustrated in a manner more common and more comprehensible than it is commendable. Mr. and Mrs. Stewart, in their foolish extravagance, balanced by an occasional equally foolish meanness, aped the Duke and Duchess, at a respectful distance, with an antique, feudal subserviency and a crass vanity which would have been purely ludicrous if it had not been also pitiable and a little alarming. The chamberlain and his wife were in their lower station very pretentious people, passionately absorbed in all the company they could procure, which, among"], [29, "Changes 17 other benefits conferred, saved the host and hostess from what was not always the too pleasant process of thinking. At the same time, the couple were perfectly respectable\u2014 as yet ; while Mr. Stewart had a deserved reputation for energy and punctuality in business, which gave him some kind of fitness to be not only chamberlain to a duke, but as the chamber lain was appointed executor of Captain Stewart's short will, guardian to Kirsten till she married or arrived at a more mature age. Mrs. Stewart, feverishly engrossed as she was, had some motherly instincts. She would have taken Kirsten to Cope Hall for a time, and even intermitted her hot pursuit of the spurious rank and gaiety for which she had acquired a desperate taste, to try and find an advantageous marriage for the young girl when the days of her mourning should be ended. This effort of benevolence would have been all the livelier because Kirsten's portion was trifling, while she had not the slightest style beyond what might be conceded to the instincts of a gentlewoman. But Kirsten gravely and sincerely thanked Mrs. Stewart for what was kindly meant in the invitation and declined it, greatly preferring her own solitary home and domestic habits. With regard to the young Stewarts of Cope Hall, and to the influence they might have had over Kirsten, the elder boys and girls were away from home, boarded at a variety of as costly and aspiring c"], [30, "18 Her Gentle Deeds. schools and colleges as the chamberlain's liberal income could compass. The young people had thus been banished for what was supposed to be their good, except during holiday intervals, ever since the Stewarts came to Cope Hall. Kirsten, by a suc cession of chances, knew little or nothing of these juniors, the less so that the eldest girl stood two or three years apart from her in age. Haythorpe was so far out of the world that it did not absolutely recognise an impropriety in so sensible and worthy a young woman as Kirsten Stewart living on by herself, save for her single servant, who, to be sure, was not very much older than Kirsten, and was not nearly so wise, any more than it would have censured her for taking apartments at the seaside on her own responsibility and for her sole use. But Kirsten herself saw that there was a necessity for a change ; something to break the bright, blythe past from what appeared the shaded, pensive future. She had a longing to visit her father and [mother's Highlands, of which she had heard much. She was certain the thunder-haunted mountains of Appin, the wild Atlantic surf breaking against the shore, the very pungent scent of the gale, which she had never smelt except in a dry, withered branch, and the reek of such peats as the single specimen which had once reached Haythorpe by a succession of carriers, would speak to her in an echo of the voices she had best loved to hear, while their unbroken silence was bow-"], [31, "Changes. 19 ing her head and crushing her heart. But she had no nearer kindred in the Highlands than cousins once or twice removed, personal strangers to her, and the season was winter, unsuited for northern travel. Then Kirsten received a letter from Australia from the woman who had. long been the principal representative of her mother's family, who was now, in fact, Kirsten's nearest surviving relative. This was a Mrs. Latham, a half-sister of Mrs. Stewart's, so very much younger that she was not above ten years older than her niece Kirsten, whom she had never seen, for the young aunt had been taken in her childhood to Australia, where she had married at eighteen. She was still living at Sydney, a suffi ciently provided-for widow of little more than thirty, with a small family of young children. Mrs. Latham's widowhood was so recent that the letter bringing the sad news crossed that which \u25a0conveyed the tidings of Kirsten's last loss. The next letter which condoled with the girl on the death of both her parents besought her, as if on the impulse of an affectionate heart, to come out at once to her widowed and equally sorrowing aunt, to whom and to whose little children Kirsten would be the greatest \" boon.\" The word caught the girl's fancy as the word \"pleasure\" might have tickled the imagination of another girl in a different mood. In the blight c 2"], [32, "Her Gentle Deeds. 20 which had fallen on Kirsten, nothing had so cut her to the heart as the sense that she was no longer of any moment or use to anybody. She had been everything to the elderly couple who were gone, and had been very happy in knowing it. The con viction that she was little or nothing to the myriads. each unit with its own interest, that remained in the world, somehow pierced her, unassuming as she was, with a stab of mingled humiliation and desolation. Her humility rather helped this conclusion. It did not enter her head that she could go abroad in the world and aid her fellows. A multitude of men and women were far better qualified than she could be for what was undeniably honourable work. Why, she was a mere home-bird girl, not gifted in any way, with an old-fashioned horror of notoriety, even of publicity, which she was persuaded constituted in her case a sure indication of what she could and could not do. Of course there must be some purpose in her continuing in the world still, or God would not keep her there, but it was dreary for her to feel doubtful, the first time in her life, for what that purpose could be \u2014 whether it might be only for her to bear the dismal burden of loneliness, and live, as far as lay in her, blamelessly till the discipline was ended. Kirsten caught at the mention of service to the nearest relation that was left to her. What was there to hinder her from going out to Australia ? She shrank, no doubt, as was inevitable with her"], [33, "Changes. 21 youthful nature, from the uprooting of her existence at Haythorpe, the parting from her graves, her dear old home, and her father and mother's and her own friends and acquaintances. It was little less than torture to anticipate the break-up of all that remained of the household, and what must take place if she carried out her half-formed intention : the sale of the furniture, with the disposal of such articles as her mother's piano and her father's writing-desk, so full of little sweet associations for her. And the long, perhaps stormy and dangerous, voyage, with the landing in a strange land, and the first interview between Kirsten and an unknown aunt, were also not without their terrors, doubts, and fears. But the attraction of being courted and wanted, together with the sick restlessness of sorrow, however kept under, proved greater than any amount of repulsion in the step which was pro posed to the girl. Kirsten Stewart was a quietly courageous and patiently resolute rather than a high-spirited or an adventurous woman. But what others could do she might do, and when she had once made up her mind, she would no longer count the difficulties and brood over the cost. People at sleepy Haythorpe opened their eyes to hear that Kirsten Stewart, who had never gone ten miles off, was about to take a voyage to Australia. But nobody had a valid objection to offer. It was"], [34, "Her Gentle Deeds. 22 right and natural in her to go to a surviving relative. It would be a change with a vengeance ; still a new world was for a young woman as well as for a young man. No doubt she would form fresh ties and settle there. Mr. Stewart, of Cope Hall, who held a right to interfere, had nothing to say against the departure. Everything was arranged ; the severe ordeals of the sale, and the leave-takings, which Kirsten had most dreaded, were gone through loyally and unsparingly, the traveller's passage in the ship was taken out, when a fresh light was shed on the arrangements. One morning's post brought and confirmed beyond doubt the information that Kirsten's patrimony was lost, with little probability of her ever recovering a penny of the two thousand pounds which Captain Stewart had looked upon as a sure provision for his daughter. He had laid out the sum in shares in a bank which he had reason to think was as safe as the Bank of England, but the trust proved misplaced, the bank had become bankrupt, and its vast debts burst upon the commercial world, leaving no hope in the minds of the initiated of a satisfactory liqui dation. One or two other inhabitants of Haythorpe suffered from the ruin, but none to the same extent as Kirsten. Her first thought was that she was thankful her father and mother had not known, and if they knew it now, it would be with such farther knowledge as"], [35, "Changes. 23 would enable them to triumph over the casualty. When God was in heaven, and Kirsten soon coming to them there, it did not matter much that her life on earth was rendered a little more toilsome, but not necessarily harder and more dangerous, since it was destined that of silver and gold she should have none. Work, even drudgery and toil, brought scant apprehension to her. For Kirsten had a well-trained, high-bred appetite for work on the whole, if, as a matter of course, some kinds of it were distasteful to her. The girl's heart sank a little because it could no longer be work done in her earthly father's house, though it might still be service rendered in one of her heavenly Father's mansions. She felt timid about her capacity for unhomely work, and hoped, with her share of nervous dismay, that she would not come to want and die of starvation. But her heart beat most tumultuously before the distressing possibility of getting into debt which she could not discharge. Yet, in the listlessness and death-in-life which had been creeping over her, the thought of \" daily work for daily bread,\" like the word \"service,\" had something welcome in it, and stirred and braced her as a call to arms arouses a weary soldier. Kirsten's second idea, on the back of her swift poverty, was that it need not keep her from going to Australia. Her passage was taken out and paid for. She could still be a comfort to her aunt without proving a burden to her. There must be more"], [36, "Her Gentle Deeds. 24 openings, with fewer competitors, to earning bread as a housekeeper or a teacher of young children. She believed these must be her lines in Australia as in England. Her townspeople were honestly sorry for the adversity which had befallen Miss Stewart. Their sorrow would have gone the length of \" raising a subscription \" for her benefit if they had not enter tained a suspicion that the proceeding, which was not actually incumbent, since she was going to her well-to-do friends in Australia, would be disliked and declined by her if she got the choice. These fair enough judges, including the Stewarts of Cope Hall, fully argued with Kirsten on the advisability of the fulfilment of her intention of going to Australia. Only some of their reasons might have surprised and mortified her, and even moved her to vehement indignation. She need not be ashamed to work for her livelihood out there, people said, though she would not like to do it here. In a colony where the male population continued greatly in excess there was every likelihood of her marrying. Mrs. Latham would take care it was at least tolerably well, without the intended husband being deterred from making an offer by the absence of a dowry. For that matter, Kirsten Stewart's capability of household management, and the steady industry in which she had been reared, would be as good as a handsome dowry with a headless, handless"], [37, "Changes, 25 wife for an inevitable incumbrance to many a thriving settler. It is not necessary to say much of the voyage, during which Kirsten at first shut herself up as far as she could, and suffered her combination of home sickness, sea-sickness, and strangeness in secret. She came out at last to the assistance of a middle aged couple going to the colony to their children. The poor elderly folks were in the meantime unmis takably at sea in more senses than one, for lack of all youthful energy, alertness, and cheerfulness to tide them over the ordeal of the voyage. Kirsten stood them in good stead. They did not call her an angel at parting in the noble bay of Sydney. She would not have liked it, they knew, but they did not even think of her afterwards in that light. Their conception of an angel was a seraphic child with blue eyes, golden hair, a hectic complexion, and a pair of rainbow-tinted wings. Now Kirsten looked older than her years, had dark hair and eyes, while her complexion assuredly was not improved by the confinement of the voyage and the sea air ; as for wings, she had not the faintest trace of pens of the soberest description. The gentleman contented himself with wringing her hand, muttering she was a good soul, and the lady kissed Kirsten and said, \" My dear, I'll tell Totty I scarcely missed her, which will make her half glad, half mad.\" The words brought the unshed tears to Kirsten's eyes,"], [38, "26 Her Gentle Deeds. while she was smiling with her lips, and nodding with all her might. As it happens, not many more details are wanted for the description of Mrs. Latham than were required for an account of Kirsten's voyage to Australia. Mrs. Latham disappeared almost imme diately from Kirsten's history. When Kirsten was looking about in some trepidation for a pale, woe-begone widow come to fetch her on shore, the captain hurried up to her, and pointing out a rosy, beaming bride, in particularly smart wedding finery, told Kirsten that lady was asking for her. \" It must be a mistake,\" exclaimed Kirsten in bewilderment, \" or else it is some friend whom my aunt has sent in place of coming for me herself.\" But the stranger stepped forward and addressed Kirsten beyond the possibility of error. \" You are my step-niece, Miss Stewart, Miss Kirsten Stewart,\" said the lady, with a peculiar simper in the middle of a certain awkwardness and distance in her demeanour. \" Yes, I am Kirsten Stewart,\" answered Kirsten, with a little gasp, \" but you cannot be my aunt, Mrs. Latham.\" \" Certainly your step-aunt, but not Mrs. Latham for the last two months,\" corrected the visitor with a great increase of the simper and a fair amount of confusion. \" It was too lonely and miserable to-"], [39, "Changes. 27 remain a widow when I was urged to become a wife again. I am Mrs. Addington now. I shall have the pleasure of introducing you to Mr. Addington presently.\" Here was a fluent yet considerably embarrassed and convicted kinswoman in the room of an ardently affectionate near relative. The impulsive widow had married again in the interval between her letter and Kirsten's arrival ; she had acquired a new guide, and passed under a fresh influence. There was no longer any call for a grown-up niece nearly as old as herself, who had in addition been so stupid as to lose her little fortune, to help the former Mrs. Latham and her children to get along without a husband and father to check her accounts, tell her whom she ought to visit, and prevent people from taking advantage of her. It was soon clear to Kirsten that this conclusion to which Mrs. Addington had come reluctantly, and with a shadow of remorse perhaps, loomed largely in the mind of Mr. Addington \u2014 a solemn, slow man \u2014 in spite of his formal and scrupulous politeness. The couple did not go so far as to repudiate Mrs. Addington's invitation while she was still Mrs. Latham, or fail to carry Kirsten to their house ; but there was the awkward stiffness, uneasiness, and un certainty of reference to the term of her stay, which left it beyond question that they would like to get quit of her whenever it was convenient for her, without"], [40, "28 Her Gentle Deeds. too much delay. Mrs. Addington just hinted that it was a great pity Kirsten had not communicated with her again before setting sail, since she, and particularly Mr. Addington, could have told her good step-sister's daughter that in the depressed state of business in the colony, above all in Sydney, it was really not a place for people without capital or prospects. Governesses' salaries had fallen ever so much, and their position was not what it had been, though no doubt situations were to be had by making an effort. Mr. Addington talked elaborately of his bush station, to which he was about to remove with Mrs. Addington and her children, and of the inadequate accommodation for a family in what had been a bachelor's log-house. It was a revelation to Kirsten, filling her with sharp pain and keen shame for her mother's sister ; but she said even less than usual \u2014 nothing at all, in fact \u2014 of her feelings, her astonishment at the turn matters had taken, and her piteous disappointment in the failure of the family affection she had come thousands of miles to seek. It lay still buried for her in the graves at Haythorpe, or was exalted as high as thc sky above her. After a night's sleeplessness by way of rest, Kirsten rose to the situation and threw off her consternation. Her mild, calm courage was growing and beginning to conquer any weak or morbid strain in her humility."], [41, "Changes. 29 Kirsten entered on a course of inquiries almost as quickly as the Addingtons could have hoped, and heard of a Mrs. Owen who wished a governess for her children. In lieu of a phenomenon of an Admi rable Crichton, or an all-pretending impostor, she was resigned to try Kirsten, who within a fortnight found herself established in the Owen's villa in another nook of the grand harbour, while Mr. and Mrs. Addington said no more of their withdrawal with their children to the bush station."], [42, "CHAPTER III. AN AUSTRALIAN HOUSEHOLD. 'Dv^^^|\\rERYTIIING had come about so quii kl} I pw\u00abra that Kirsten had not got time so much as iPf*ftgjjlffl*l to remark its strangeness. Tlie very novelties which her strong, fine perceptions would at once have seized, marvelled over, enjoyed in a fashion, and made a possession for ever, were crowded together and blurred so that they could not stand out clearly in her mind in after years. The vivid first im pressions were lost. She was wont to say she could never recollect distinctly what should have struck her on her arrival in Sydney. It was all a jumble of a great inland sea, dazzling sunshine, men as well as women in white clothes, houses with verandahs, and what she supposed, erroneously possibly, must be passion-vines, gum-trees, cabbage-palms, and tree ferns. Mrs. Owen, a faded belle and care-worn woman, seeking to begin as she desired to end, took up a position of as great social distance from Kirsten as one lady could well assume towards another. Mrs. Owen had herself insisted on the qualification of"], [43, "An A ustralian Household. 31 ladyhood in her children's governess, and had even expressed some faint satisfaction at Kirsten's being the daughter of a deceased officer, though the satisfied person was utterly ignorant whether Captain Stewart might not have been the lowest scamp and greatest blackguard who ever disgraced a mess-table. But from the moment Kirsten entered the family Mrs. Owen's main object in their relation seemed to be to keep her retainer at as great a distance and hold as little intercourse with her as was possible in two members of one household. The effort would have been perfectly successful without half the trouble. Kirsten was naturally as retiring a creature, requiring as much drawing out before she would take anything upon her or volunteer an approach to friendship, as Mrs. Owen could have imagined in her most sanguine dreams. The result of the guarded, frigid intercourse, limited for the most part to \" Good morning,\" \" Good evening,\" languid questions into the children's pro gress, and general directions, was that at the end of a month Kirsten knew no more of Mrs. Owen than the governess-candidate had seen and guessed in the first interview. The lady was an artificial, depressed, disappointed woman. Kirsten had early arrived at the shrewd suspicion that the disappointment might be in part the victim's own doing. Mrs. Owen had conceived exalted ideas of the family's consequence, with which the straitened income of a small govern-"], [44, "Her Gentle Deeds. 32 ment official did not at all agree ; and the extent to which the public of Sydney, like the public of most great towns, valued money, the possession of which was displayed in luxurious expenditure, and gave it the preference, treating other claims lightly, mortified and embittered her. The side of Mrs. Owen's disappointment for which she might not be answerable, was the exceedingly limited amount of his countenance which Mr. Owen bestowed on her and their children, and the large proportion of time and money that could ill be spared he wasted in other circles. It might have been thought that the cold shoulder turned on Mrs. Owen by the only approach to society which she would allow to exist in Sydney, together with the habitual neglect of her husband, would have disposed her to be on more friendly terms with her governess, and to turn to her as to a comforter in need ; but that was not Mrs. Owen's notion of the conduct called for from her under the circumstances. She considered that in a colony of all places, where the most essential barriers of birth and breeding are constantly broken down and set aside, a lady could not be too careful. She had only herself to look to, to preserve the position of the family, since Mr. Owen was thoroughly indifferent where they were concerned, and went everywhere on his own account, being only careful to find pleasure for himself. If she did not keep herself and the children up where"], [45, "An Australian Household. 33 should they be? Therefore she must resort to a system of severe isolation. Kirsten could hardly be said to have learnt more of Mr. Owen in the meantime than the cast of his profile and the key of his voice. In the whole month he had dined at home thrice, and spent one evening in the house. Twice he had knocked and put his head inside the schoolroom door, bowed and smiled, and hoped Miss Stewart was getting on famously with the children. Once he had hurried past her in a corridor, then turned back to say he trusted she was well and the little people were not too troublesome. This slight acquaintance with her employer left Kirsten under the impression that he was a good-looking gentleman-like man with light blue eyes, the glances of which shifted constantly, a facile smile, and a plausible address, which was rather a relief after Mrs. Owen's stand-off bearing. Kirsten was thrown upon the children for human interest and sympathy from the beginning, unless she had descended to the kitchen, where, as the house maid told her, volunteering the information, the ser vants were constantly coming and going, since victuals were not liberal ; the place was as dull as ditch-water, and Missus thought fit to interdict followers. During the first long afternoon, after luncheon, which also served for the governess and children's dinner, when the usual routine of lessons had not yet been established, while Mrs. Owen was eating D"], [46, "Her Gentle Deeds. 34 her late dinner in solitary state, before the school room laboured under the obligation of preparing to repair to the drawing-room for tea, Kirsten had an opportunity of gauging the dispositions of her pupils and future associates. The children were four in number, but only two appeared in the schoolroom. The youngest was still a baby, and the next child, in contradiction to the other healthy, handsome children, was a sickly, plain, peevish little girl of four years, on whom, as so often happens in such cases, the mother's heart was set. With regard to Kirsten's charges, Katie was a girl of nine, Beville a boy of seven. They formed a great mental and moral contrast to each other, though in physique both were fine robust children. In place of showing herself daunted by her new governess, Katie fairly staggered Kirsten by the searching ex amination through which the pupil put the teacher, as an apparent precaution before the younger resigned herself to the instructions of the elder. Had Miss Stewart been to school ? Where, and for how long ? What English grammar did she use ? Did she begin history with \"Little Arthur?\" Had she a useful information book ? Did she approve of starting her music pupils with a long succession of exercises or very easy tunes ? Mamma approved of the exercises, but Katie herself was inclined to favour the tunes. Had Miss Stewart gone as far as decimals in arith _metic ? Papa said everybody could and ought to"], [47, "An Australian Household. 35 learn the decimal system, though mamma did not know it. Was Miss Stewart aware that she, Katie, could repeat perfectly the four leading French verbs ? No girl in the school had done so without blunders save Katie herself, and Mademoiselle was very much pleased. Katie and Beville had gone to a school during the last six months, but mamma had removed them because she disliked its mixed character, and Martha had been rude about walking with them there and back in addition to her other work. Martha could get through her work in time if she chose, but she would dawdle and go into the verandah to look out for the baker's apprentice. Wasn't it idle and giddy of Martha ? And, oh ! did Miss Stewart know that Miss Calthorpe, their last governess, could not spell properly \u2014 actually put refusing with an e in the middle of the word in a note which she wrote for mamma ? Now, had Miss Stewart ever heard anything like that in a governess who professed to be able to teach a lady's children ? Katie's imitative powers were displayed in her giving to the life her mother's air and tone in several of these sentences. The whole tenor of the conver sation served to indicate that Katie was clever with more than a parrot-like cleverness. She had cer tainly remarkable strength and length of memory, but she had also an adaptability of taste and talent which made most lessons easy to her in her very childhood, and she started in life with a positive D 2"], [48, "36 Her Gentle Deeds. craving for information. Her mother, poor lady, was secretly proud of her eldest daughter's promise, and, though she had the discretion to keep the pride to herself as much as possible, her own deprivations and self-denial drove her into making the child the mother's companion and confidante. Katie's vigilant examination of Kirsten had not been entered upon with any malicious or hostile motive. The child had an honest, susceptible, and affectionate temper; she was perfectly well and kindly disposed, even to an alarming extent when her examination proved favourable. The senti mental element in Katie came out. She wished to strike up an equal friendship with Kirsten on the spot, telling her in a transparently insinuating man ner that Katie's old governess had been very fond of her pupil \u2014 according to Katie herself, she was a marvel and delight to everybody she came near \u2014 they were more like sisters than teacher and taught. When she was speaking to Miss Calthorpe, she, Katie, always called her governess \" Lucy,\" which was her Christian name. What was Miss Stewart's Christian name ? \" How do you know I have a Christian name, Katie ? \" Kirsten parried the threatened encroach ment. She saw she would need every vantage ground, implying age and authority over the irre pressible Katie. Besides, Kirsten was by no means the woman to bandy Christian names, even with her"], [49, "An A ustralian Household 37 contemporaries, on a moment's notice. Her confi dence had to be won, her liking wooed ; then when her heart came to be given it was not transferable, but belonged to the fortunate recipient for ever. In the meantime Beville had held aloof from his new governess, merely taking stock of her out of the corners of his merry blue eyes, while he pretended to pursue with the greatest intentness his occupation of marshalling marbles on the floor. \" Come and make acquaintance with me, Beville,\" Kirsten invited him with sympathetic shyness. Beville sidled over to her, thrust forward his shoulder and a soiled left hand, then tore himself away, and retreated to his marbles, appearing to be more engrossed by them than ever. \" Beville is dreadfully stupid,\" Katie began to tell their teacher volubly. \" He is good for nothing except games and mischief. He is so far back \u2014 you cannot think how far ! He is not able to read a word for himself, and he is seven. When I was six I could read ' Line upon Line ' quite plainly, and by the time I was seven I had gone through mamma's old copy of 'Anna Ross,' and was into the ' Swiss Family Robinson.' Now I am getting tired of the ' Water Babies ' and ' Alice in Wonderland.' I should like to try Scott, not the ' Grandfather,' but the ' Waverley's ' ; and Miss Edgeworth, not her ' Little Frank,' or her ' Harry and Lucy,' of course, but her ' Helen,' which mamma has told me of."], [50, "Her Gentle Deeds. 38 Have you read ' Helen,' Miss Stewart ? ' No f ? Why, where have you been ? When I am as old as you are I expect to have read everything \u2014 every thing \" (with emphasis), \" even ' Jane Eyre ' and ' Adam Bede,' which mamma says are not for young girls \u2014 only for married ladies like herself. But when I have gone through everything else I am sure she will let me try them \u2014 she must, you know, for I shall have nothing besides left.\" \"You will have plenty to do before then,\" said Kirsten with a laugh. \" Shan't I ? Why, even papa's library is as big \u2014 as big as the British Museum, I daresay. But about Beville. He is dreadfully naughty too. He used to play truant when we were at school ; and he tells such fibs\u2014 oh, by the dozen ! \" \" I say, Kattens, that's a whopper ! \" cried Beville in a shrill but rather elated voice, so elated that his exultation had prevailed over his mauvaise honte. He was clearly listening with all his ears to the tale of delinquencies, and deriving much gratification from their extent and enormity. At the same time, he was not childishly vain like Katie ; he was a manly, self-willed child. \" Oh, Bev,\" protested Katie, scandalised by the nature of the contradiction, \" you hear ! He speaks such low language. Mamma does not know where he has picked it up, unless from the boy who used to clean the knives.\""], [51, "An Australian Household. 39 \" That is a sell !\" said Beville scornfully. \" Why, I taught Joe the worst words he knows.\" \" And he helps himself to what he wants. You must take care of your knife and pencils, Miss Stewart ; and never have any sweets lying about.\" \" I call that mean, Kattens,\" muttered Beville, colouring a little ; \" but go on, I'll pay you out when we're sent to bed.\" Kirsten began to have some apprehension lest burglary and murder should be added to the list of Beville's crimes. \" I can manage him best,\" Katie assured her governess confidently. \" When he is very bad I take him aside and talk to him.\" The process did not strike Kirsten as likely to be all-powerful, but when she knew the children better she discovered there was a real and strong affection between the pair that seemed so ill-assorted. The little prig and pedant Katie exercised a wonderful amount of influence over the small mauvais sujet. He believed in her and looked up to her under his miniature assumption of scorn and derision. The faith was a signal proof of the precious grains of reality under Katie's bushel of childish affectations ; and the child would have gone through fire and water for the brother whom she was constantly rating and censuring. The sight of the little girl so rarely subdued, overcome by some unparalleled transgression on her playfellow's part, hanging her"], [52, "Her Gentle Deeds. 40 head and crying on his account, was one of the most pathetic Kirsten encountered. On this occasion the children forgot their differ ences at the sound of an organ at the gate. They rushed together to dance to the music, forming a pretty picture as they bounded and swayed here and there with interlaced arms, harmonious feet, spon taneous unconscious grace of gesture, and perfect rhythm of movement. Presently they nestled down wearied to rest and whisper together. Kirsten seized the moment for letting her thoughts stray thousands of miles away to Haythorpe. It would presently be morning there, the hour at which she used to carry her mother her cup of tea, and open the door for her father returning from his early walk to Nash's, the bookseller's, for his paper and the last edition of the news of the town \u2014 whether the doctor had any hope of poor Tom Bone's re covery from his accident, or if the police had hit upon any traces of the thieves who had taken the black silk umbrella and the greatcoat from the hall at the vicarage. All at once Kirsten found herself caught tight by the throat with an alarming jerk, while Katie rushed to the rescue, crying, \" I could not help it, Miss Stewart. I told him not to garrote you. But, oh, please, don't tell mamma, for she must speak to papa when he has time to listen ! Then Beville will be whipped, and he clenches his teeth and grows"], [53, "An A ustralian Household. 41 white and sick, but will not say he is sorry and he won't do it again. Oh, do let me speak to him ! I shall make him beg your pardon, and it will be all right ! \" And Katie hung about Kirsten, imploring her with an urgency in which there was no acting. \" I was not garroting her, you goosey,\" growled the precocious Beville. \" I was only trying to lass (probably lasso) her. You read about it to me out of your geography book yesterday. I did it for a 'speriment.\" \" But as I am not a horse, Beville, you see it was no use. You have only frightened me for nothing.\" Beville laughed and executed a few impromptu hops of glee at having frightened any lady. But when Kirsten involuntarily put her hand to her throat where the jerk had caused her pain, the little fellow was at her side in a moment looking grave, as he seldom looked. \" Have I hurt you, Miss Stewart ? I didn't mean it. I am beastly sorry, and I'll never do it again. I'll say that without Katie's asking me. I'll sit here like a man till the tea-bell rings,\" pressing close to his new acquaintance, even putting a sturdy little arm over her. \" Hallo ! what's that ? \" and off he was like a shot to the window, imperatively sum moned by the first sound without. Beville Owen was often the naughtiest of little boys, but he was also one of the most winning, without being in the least a curled darling, or a"], [54, "Her Gentle Deeds. 42 kissing, caressing, impostor. It was in being the reverse that a part of his charm lay. He exercised a fascination over the very maidservant, with whom he had a kicking and boxing match every time his face was washed or the pockets of his trousers turned out, whom he tormented and hindered in her proper business, by a thousand harassing devices and mis chievous tricks, in season and out of season, every day of their respective lives. This much-tried and put-upon functionary drew the nice distinction, \" that while Miss Katie hardly ever failed in obedience and helpfulness, she was that cocky sometimes that nobody had spirit left to do more than stand her ; but Master Beville, though he was the most worritingest boy in creation, would make hisself liked wherever he went. He was so manful and kind, and thought nothing of hisself; rather showed the wust of his naughtiness. He vexed his little heart, bless him ! if he took it into his head that he had given anybody real pain. When he was right down ill, in place of crying ' Wolf! ' and playing at being at his last gasp, a lamb could not have behaved quieter than Master Beville till he felt a shade of betterness, and then he was up from his pillow and a greater pickle than ever in a flash. He would give many a woman a sore heart, and never want an excuse made for him and a service rendered to him,. would Master Beville if he were spared.\""], [55, "CHAPTER'IV \" IF I COULD GET THE CHILDREN BACK TO ENGLAND.\" ITTLE Mary Owen, the poor child invalid, at her best was a great charge and anxiety, but in scarcely more than a month after Kirsten went to the Owens, Mary was at her worst, having been attacked by an epidemic prevalent in the town, which from the first threatened to prove fatal. Mrs. Owen, who was devoted to her children according to her light, watched by the patient night and day. In her solicitude for the others, as well as in her absorbing affection for Mary, she would not permit Kirsten to share the sick-room duties, and kept her at a greater distance than ever, obeying to the letter the Bible injunction to separate the broken from the whole. But inevitably the girl's quiet, unobtrusive, but most earnest interest and sympathy, her sad early knowledge of sickness and death, greater than that of Mrs. Owen, though she was a matron twice Kirsten's age, when the last straits came, burst"], [56, "Her Gentle Deeds. 44 through every impediment, and caused Kirsten, in spite of herself, to come to the front. Her services were not confined to looking after Katie and Beville in their quarters, subduing the excited wailings and the nervous tremors, which belonged to Katie's lively conception of her part as a mourning sister, and cheering Beville's brief fits of silent depression, alternating with his equally boisterous seasons of forgetfulness and resumption of his noisy play. Kirsten was in quarantine, but that did not prevent her from sitting up to see that fresh milk or jelly or beef-tea was sent in to the sick-room during the long silent hours, or from preparing the nourishment with her own skilled hands, lest the sleepy cook should not do justice to the materials, until in the end the nurse could not get a poultice to please her unless Miss Stewart made it. It was Kirsten who, though it were only through a go between, must urge rest and refreshment on the broken-hearted mother ; and Kirsten sought out the daintiest little frilled night-gown which was to supersede all other garments on the tiny wasted figure ; Kirsten gathered the sprigs of the mother's favourite flowers to strew on the smooth pillow ; Kirsten went noiselessly about the dreary pre parations for the funeral and the family mournings. I Such is the simple force of character in the primitive troubles of life, that during the melan choly bustling week when little Mary Owen lay"], [57, "If I could get the Children to England. 45 dying and dead, every individual in the house, down to the most heedless and senseless, came in an incalculably short time to recognise and pay tribute to the unbought, unsparing alacrity of service, the unselfish, unwearied goodness and friendliness which had lain hidden in the stranger young governess who had lately entered the house ; she had only needed an opportunity to \"mother,\" or sister, or daughter every soul of them, from the highest to the lowest, from the youngest to the oldest. In other circumstances the ignorant people might have over looked, undervalued, even gibed at Kirsten for many a day. As it was, they suddenly turned with all content and without the slightest hesitation to the unassuming youthful figure, as if they looked to it for counsel and help. Thenceforth everybody in the establishment spoke of Miss Stewart with more or less respect and cordiality. The violent prejudice which reigns in the servants' hall against the next grade of servants \u2014 governesses, tutors, &c. \u2014 vanished summarily where Kirsten was concerned. The master of the house, like its other members, took to relying on Kirsten during the days when he had the grace to remain in the darkened rooms. \" Poor little thing ; she was never like the rest ; she would not have had much pleasure in life ; she is better away.\" His moan was soon made, as they say in Scotland. Then it was, \"And you think Wednesday the most suitable day for the funeral ?"], [58, "46 Her Gentle Deeds. It is better to have it over as soon as possible. I cannot be longer out of the office. I have tried, without much success, to rouse Mrs. Owen to what has to be done. May I count on your good offices in support of my wishes, to impress them on her when she is able to bear them ? Women can always deal best with each other at such times.\" This, too, was an easy conclusion. Kirsten had an inclination to contradict him, and say, \" No, not when the man is in his true place. Nobody can come between husband and wife, between the nearest and dearest. No stranger ought to inter meddle with the solemn, piteous crises of family life.\" But she wisely refrained. Mrs. Owen \u2014 forced to have recourse to a hired inmate of her house in the bitterest hours of her life \u2014 opened her mouth and spoke, first a little and then a great deal, of Mary and of the remaining children. She exalted her lost darling, and made her out to be one of the flowers of the family. Kirsten knew that the father's careless estimate was the more correct, but the mother's conduct was the more natural, and beyond comparison the more lovable. Kirsten listened patiently and compassionately to poor Mrs. Owen's lamentations, learned that she felt her chief treasure torn from the heart with every fibre of which it had been closely intertwined, and her occupation gone \u2014 for a large part of Mrs. Owen's"], [59, "// / could get the Children to England. 47 life and thoughts had been engrossed with cherishing Mary, who had since her babyhood stood in need of much fostering. Thus a death-blow was dealt to all the mother's most careful plans and fondest hopes. In addition, her devouring sorrow for the withdrawal of the one child was surcharged with haunting apprehension for the other children. They would be taken away as Mary had been transplanted to heaven, which was infinitely best in one sense, but in another it was hard to have the young lives which had sprung from her own all blighted in the bud. The same climate which had proved fatal to Mary would be deadly to Katie and Beville and the baby. It was not only Melbourne which was pre judicial to children. It had always turned out as bad in her case. \" Oh ! if I could get my children back to England,\" was now the burden of every cry wrung from the mourner. As is usually true in fancies, argument was of no avail. In vain Kirsten represented the excellent health of Katie, Beville, and the baby, and reminded Mrs. Owen of Mary's constitutional delicacy. All the accumulated troubles and trials of the woman's life had at last centred in her residence in Australia and Sydney. She spoke of the place as if it were the Gold Coast or Tartarus. \" This horrid town, with its burning-up, withering sunshine and choking dust, no wonder poor little human flowers droop parched and spent. I have never had a happy day here."], [60, "48 Her Gentle Deeds. And now it has cost me my pet lamb, my patient, sweet little love ; nobody knew how sweet she was save her miserable mother, to whom she looked in vain for help and comfort. Oh, my Mary, my Mary ! And the others will follow Mary. Mark my words, Miss Stewart, this land of glare and drought will be the grave of the whole family. I shall be left that most pitiable object \u2014 a childless mother, if, indeed, I survive the doom of my children. Yes, I am a Christian, and I know who took little children in His arms and blessed them. I hope to meet them all again above ; but we mothers look to seeing our children growing up around us here, brightening our careworn lives, leading good and happy lives them selves, and laying our tired heads in the grave before they are ready to follow us.\" Soon Mrs. Owen's health began to give way under her unrelieved, unabating passion of sorrow and home-sickness, which, with the unselfishness of true mothers, was more for her children than herself. Then a new terror became added to her other dread. \" If I die first, what will become of the children left in this howling wilderness of a country, this heartless, vulgar-minded, bustling, grasping Sydney? Men do not mind, and what can they know about children's requirements ? Fathers have no resource except to leave their families to un principled servants.\" This was all the reflection which poor Mrs. Owen permitted herself to make"], [61, "If I could get the Children to England. 49 on her husband and her children's father ; whatever her failings as a wife, her mouth was closed against Charles Owen. Her pride alone would have pre vented her from uttering a complaint against him. \"If I could only get the children back to England,\" Mrs. Owen gave vent to her longing, day after day. \" My father and mother are both dead. My sisters are married, and their husbands are not rich men ; they have their own burdens to bear. But there is my brother James home from India. He is high up in the army and a bachelor. He sent Beville his silver mug and Katie her bangles, and my lost darling and Bab their ivory toys. He would not refuse to give a home to his nephew and nieces till their father could use all his interest to be recalled and have some post at home, in a temperate climate. I would consent to part with all the children that are left to me to-morrow, with little prospect of ever seeing them again in this life, if I could only think they were going back to England.\" Kirsten managed to have a private interview with Mr. Owen, and imparted to him her fear that the strain of the continual perturbation and anxiety, along with Mrs. Owen's immeasurable grief, might be too much for strength already shaken. Mr. Owen listened most politely, and pleasantly thanked Miss Stewart ; trusted she was wrong. All sorrow yielded to time ; it must be so, else how would the world go on ? He would see what he could do. E"], [62, "Her Gentle Deeds. 50 Poor Mrs. Owen, who was rather of a melancholy temperament naturally, was much to be pitied. But it was the duty of everybody to cultivate cheerful ness, and he had no doubt she would get more cheerful in the course of a few weeks or months. He was afraid it was out of the question for him to think of returning to England within the next two years. Fortunes were no longer made in so short a time in the colony, at least, by poor Govern ment officials. The other children were perfectly well if Mrs. Owen would only believe it, and she would do well too as soon as she could submit to the inevitable. He was sure they were all greatly indebted to Miss Stewart for what she had done for them in their hour of trial. Mrs. Owen ought to consider herself exceedingly fortunate in having secured such a friend for the family. He might be allowed to say that he was fully aware of these obligations, which he could never forget. No, England was not to be thought of for ten years to come, but he would see what he could contrive when the rainy season, which had just begun, was over, in getting a change for them all by a voyage round to Melbourne, and even to Van Diemen's Land. The rainy season was not over when one morning Mr. Owen came out of his dressing room and spoke to his wife, who was still in bed. He was just going out for a long day's social no less .than official engagements, since he was very popular in certain"], [63, "If I could get the Children to England. 51 sets. Receiving no reply, he leaped to the conclusion that she had fallen asleep again, and left the house \" quite comfortable,\" as he described his frame of mind afterwards. In the course of an hour the nurse, with a scared face, came hurrying to knock at Kirsten's door. The servant had gone with the baby to her mother, but could not make the mistress of the house attend and answer, though the nurse did not think Mrs. Owen was fair asleep. Kirsten ran at the summons, and found the poor woman asleep indeed, but in the first stage of the sleep from which there is no awaking. She was in a state of coma, the result of an affection of the brain, which was the sudden end of long wasting and pining, and of her rainy season of overpowering anguish and terror. She had passed at one step, during the silence of the night, out of every-day life, beyond the reach of physicians, the prospect of recovery, or even the probability of holding further communication with her kind here. Merci fully for her, doubtless, while she was hastening to rejoin her darling, she was saved the agony of parting from her other children, or of any further earthly care on their account. Kirsten sent for the doctor, tried what simple remedies occurred to her, and dispatched messenger after messenger for the absent husband, tracking him from haunt to haunt, and only reaching him e 2"], [64, "Her Gentle Deeds. 52 towards nightfall, when he returned to his house just in time to see the last breath drawn by the woman he had taken to shield and cherish. Mr. Owen was scared by the unexpected calamity \u2014 something very different from the small loss of a sickly little child \u2014 till the kind woman's heart bled for him in only a less degree than it bled for the stunned, half-conscious children at the first sharp moment of bereavement, and cheering the sombre whirl of business that ensued again within these few short weeks. Kirsten, as a climax to the consideration she had already won, stood in the room of the mistress of the family, till its master should recover sufficiently to make fresh arrangements. In the meantime neither he nor Mrs. Owen had relations in the colony, and she had not possessed such an intimate female friend as might have entered the breach on this occasion. The reins of govern ment fell for the time into Kirsten's hands \u2014 able, but half willing, half reluctant. Willing, because of her sympathy, kindness, and capability ; reluctant, from her modesty and the common sense which caused her to weigh all claims and apportion her own as inconsiderable, to say the least. Kirsten Stewart was one of the very small number of persons who, had she got her choice, would have literally obeyed the Divine injunction to take the lowest room at a feast, and so have had the certainty of"], [65, "If I could get the Children to England. 53 receiving honour from the master in the presence of her fellow-guests. But the servants came to her for their orders, and implied that if they had not her to appeal to and to support them with her weak yet steadfast Christian woman's strength, they would abandon in a body the household which death had twice invaded without, as it were, stopping to take breath. The children clung to her. Mr. Owen showed her plainly he, too, would be lost without her. She could not help herself. Kirsten had enough to do without requiring to read and digest a note from Mrs. Addington deploring Mrs. Owen's death, because of the imme diate alteration it must bring about in Kirsten's affairs \u2014 \"You seemed really wonderfully well settled ; now it will be all to do over again, for, of course, a young woman like you cannot remain alone in the house with a widower.\" Surely there was time enough for that con sideration ; but Kirsten was too reasonable not to admit it must have its weight later. Happily for her, she had hardly settled herself, so that there would be less pain in the unsettling, though her heart sank a little before the inference thus suggested. Was she to drift thenceforth with nothing in her lot fixed \u2014 so far as any mortal destiny could be fixed ; with no abiding rest for the sole of her foot, which was to trudge from one governess's post to another, like the foot of the Wandering Jew ?"], [66, "Her Gentle Deeds. 54 Mr. Owen cut the Gordian knot on the morning after the funeral. He detained Kirsten when he had sent the children away after breakfast, to speak with him alone in the dining-room. He still looked worn and harassed. \" I shall make it my law,\" he said with an effort at firmness, and less ease of manner than was natural to him, \" to comply with all poor Mrs. Owen, my late wife's, wishes, at any sacrifice to myself, to the uttermost of my power, and, if it were possible, beyond my power. You said the desire ot her heart was that the children should go back to England. Then to England they shall go by the very next ship. I shall break up the establish ment here, and board or lodge as I find most convenient. My personal feelings are a small matter,\" he said, with as much apparent sincerity as if he had shown himself the most unselfish and considerate of men during the whole term of his existence. \" The question of much greater importance on which I wish to consult you is the welfare of the children, and, permit me to add, your own,\" con tinued Mr. Owen. \" Are you willing to accompany them to England at double your present salary ? No, don't interrupt me ; you have no need to tell me that such services as yours cannot be bought by any amount of salary, and no money can repay what you have done, for their poor mother and the children, during the brief period that we have had the blessing"], [67, "If I could get the Children to England. 55 of your help ; yet I am seeking to impose a further obligation on you.\" Mr. Owen's voice fairly faltered at these words, and Kirsten was in terror lest he should break down utterly before her. She had never suspected that he was a man of delicate or keen feelings. He re covered himself presently. \" I am sensible it will be no easy task, though I shall do everything I can to make it lighter for you, to take the three children the long distance to England. And how do I know that you care, under any circumstances, to revisit the mother country ? But I think that, short as our acquaintance has unhappily proved, you take sufficient interest in us to feel for us in our distress, and I have learned by experience the extent and practical nature of Miss Stewart's sympathy.\" \" Don't speak of it, Mr. Owen,\" said Kirsten, gravely disturbed by what seemed to her like ex travagant compliments. Mr. Owen consented to pass on to business de tails. \" Of course your passage would be paid along with that of the children, and I should send you straight to my banker, who would give you advice, if necessary, on your arrival, as well as provide you with funds.

I believe there is nothing further for me to say than that, if you have the smallest hesitation to take this step, or if it interferes with any other plans you may have entertained for yourself, I beg of you to dismiss it from your mind without another thought. I am far too much indebted to you already. I have no doubt I shall be able to find a substitute, though I fear not one in whom I can place the entire confidence I should have in you. But if the worst comes to the worst \u2014 I mean if no suitable person turns up \u2014 I dare say any respectable captain of a vessel, with the assistance of a good-natured stewardess, would look after the poor little things on the voyage, and some body could be appointed to meet them on their arrival.\""], [69, "CHAPTER V. KIRSTEN ACCEPTS THE COMMISSION. \u00a7 !>lf~lIRSTEX was taken aback by Mr- \u00b0wen's 3 SrOvfl prompt compliance with his late wife's jjJl\u00e6iffigli wish when death had set its seal on it. She tried to interrupt him more than once when he was referring to herself ; but as he went on, her mind perforce became occupied with his scheme. She seemed to hear ringing in her ears Mrs. Owen's beseeching prayer, \" Oh, if I could get the children sent back to England ! \" Kirsten was not superstitious ; she was far from electing herself into a chosen instrument of Providence. Still she had a sense that there was something providential in her presence in the Owen's family at this time, and that here was a call for her to do what would certainly be best for a set of motherless little children, to fulfil a dying mother's behest. Few girls could have been so free to agree to Mr. Owen's proposal, and accept the offered commission. They, as a rule, had their friends to consider ; she had no near friends \u2014 none who would be affected by"], [70, "58 Her Gentle Deeds. her going or staying. She might consult her step aunt, Mrs. Addington ; but she had afforded sufficient proof that she did not want Kirsten. Australia \u2014 of which she knew little \u2014 had no special attraction for her. Situations by which a woman could earn her living might be more plentiful there than in England, though Kirsten suspected that statement must be taken with the important qualification, that the woman seeking to work for her bread ought not to be too particular, as she was apt to be in the mother country. On the contrary, she should be willing to turn her hand to anything and everything, and if she were only willing to do that at home, very likely she would fare as well near as afar. And the last objection was set at rest by Mr. Owen finding a future situation for Kirsten. His plan included the desire that she should stay on with the children and make a home for them \u2014 doubtless till he came back or they were old enough to go out to him. He might marry again ; but Kirsten could not bear to regard that chance, at once with poor Mrs. Owen's empty chair so recently vacated. At the same time, Kirsten's reason told her that Mr. Owen was precisely the man to take another wife as soon as possible. It might or might not be the best thing for a man like him ; but it was no business of hers. In looking out for a situation as governess, even in the beginning, when she complied with Mrs."], [71, "Kirsten accepts the Commission. 59 Latham's entreaty to come to her and her children, Kirsten had told herself with conscientious careful ness that she had been little accustomed to children, seeing that she had been the only child of her father and mother. She did not suppose that she had the immoderate fondness for babies which some children, brought up among them, displayed. Kirsten had rather the impression that her heart went out to old people \u2014 weather-beaten, like her father, growing feeble, like her mother \u2014 than to unknown children, with their fearless exactions and the promise and performance alike of their lives before them. Now that Kirsten had been a little used to children, in the persons of the small Owens, she did not find them by any means faultless, or an unmixed source of delight. Both Katie and Beville were in different ways often exceedingly trying, and the charge of them involved a great deal of worry and weariness besides that work which Kirsten did not mind. As for the baby, Clarissa,' Kirsten had merely taken the child in her arms once or twice, in the wish not to intrude into the province or provoke the hostility of so high a functionary as an experienced nurse. This nurse happened to be a jealous woman and regarded the baby as her own property, with which its mother might meddle, but no proud dirt of a governess was to interfere. But seven weeks' acquaintance in sorrow at the last had done something to knit Kirsten's interests"], [72, "60 Her Gentle Deeds. to those of the children, and her whole heart melted when she pictured them desolate as their father had represented them. She thought of Katie, of whom her mother had been proud, who had risen so far from the shock which had for once crushed and abashed the child. She had asked that very day when the keys were to be given to her, and how long it would be before she was allowed to sit at the head of the table ; while she complained that nurse would not call her Miss Owen instead of Miss Katie, and the housemaid had carried the letters which came when Katie's papa was out to Miss Stewart first, instead of to her, Katie, though she had taken letters for poor mamma before, and she was now in mamma's place, as darling mamma would have liked her to be. Katie, before the first day on board was over, would render herself objectionable to the whole ship. Nobody would comprehend that the child was really more than half in earnest, when she crossed her hands in an ostentatious manner, and said in a plaintive falsetto voice, \" My mamma has been taken from me and my heart is broken.\" She would be ridiculed, pushed aside, even knocked about \u2014 the little creature whom her mother had applauded and cherished. She would be as much disliked as a foolish child could be. Not one of these wise, candid, grown-up people would guess that poor affectionate young Katie, whom they nick-named"], [73, "Kirsten accepts the Commission. 61 \" Little Presumption,\" or \" Bundle of Airs,\" after she had striven earnestly and at last succeeded in getting Beville to go aside and say a private prayer with her, in addition to that galloped through at Miss Stewart's knee, would sob herself to sleep with her head buried in the pillow, where she had no reason to suppose she could be either seen or heard. Kirsten thought of Beville. He had cried in the short sharp grief of a child, and moped for the first few days after his mother's death. He had since contrived a plot to trip every member of the family, his father not excepted, midway down the flight of steps which led from the hall door. He had been caught not merely swinging on the banisters and jumping on the water-butt, but scrambling over the roof. If ever a child got up into the rigging and fell down headlong, or slipped overboard, he would be that victim on the voyage home. If he escaped drowning, he would most certainly damage his juvenile character beyond redemption, and incur heavy threats of immediate punishment with gloomy prophecies of disgrace and ruin when he came to be a man. For if there were a petty larceny of odds and ends of string and bits of wood or brass and steel committed in the ship in which Beville could have a hand, he would be the man, or rather the child. Yet, brief as their acquaintance had been, the world must become an emptier, darker, sadder place"], [74, "62 Her Gentle Deeds. to Kirsten if the restless little feet were still, the roguish smile quenched, if she had sustained the last brusque rub of the fresh ruddy cheek against her own somewhat thin and pale one, which was Beville's manner of volunteering to bestow a caress on his governess. To imagine Beville's bold little face and sturdy small back acquiring a sly, sneaking, hang-dog look and air sickened Kirsten, and gave her a passing taste of how poor mothers' hearts are broken. Kirsten must protect the children and stand be tween them and harm ; she must take them home to England as their mother had wished, and see that they passed into more careful keeping than that of their father. \" I am much obliged by your confidence in me, Mr. Owen,\" she said ; \" I have been very happy to do what I could.\" (Kirsten's forte was not making fine speeches.) \" You will give me time to think over it all. I may say I believe I shall go with the children to England as you desire me to do, and as I hope their mother would have chosen. I have been long enough with them to understand them a little, and for them to understand me. I can promise to do my best for them. Mrs. Owen talked to me of a brother of hers \u2014 he was in the army I fancy \u2014 to whom she would like to send the children.\" Kirsten spoke hesitatingly, from a fear of going out of her province."], [75, "Kirsten accepts the Commission. 63 Mr. Owen did not draw back. \" Oh, General James,\" he said readily. \" That might not be a bad idea, but Barnard, my banker, will see to all that. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, Miss Stewart, for taking my proposal into your best con sideration, with the result, I trust, of agreeing to it.\" Kirsten went through the form of writing to con sult Mrs. Addington, who, not caring particularly to have a kinswoman of hers in the position of a governess in Sydney, began by warmly advocating her step-niece's instant compliance with Mr. Owen's very gratifying arrangement. It would be so nice for Kirsten to get back at once, without any trouble or expense, to England, where all her previous life had been spent, and where she must have so many friends. It had been rather a mistake \u2014 Mrs. Adding ton would mention it now \u2014 for Kirsten to have quitted her native country rashly. But the mistake was to be happily rectified with the advantage gained that Kirsten would be able to say that she had seen Australia ; she had also made the acquaintance of her dear mother's half-sister, who could not be so selfish as to propose to detain her niece, when it was clearly for her good in every respect that she should hasten to avail herself of Mr. Owen's very flattering and suitable plan. It would be so much better for her in every way, so much more independent and dignified to keep house for the Owen children in England, than to attempt to seek another situation"], [76, "64 Her Gentle Deeds. as governess in Sydney. Mr. Owen's offer was indeed a gratifying proof of the satisfaction which she had already given her employer, and the esteem in which he held her. The details of the scheme were all huddled up within so short a space of time, that Kirsten could hardly breathe\u2014 not to say sit down and reflect and make improvements on the proposal. Mr. Owen learned that a most desirable ship, the Prince Arthur, was to sail within the next ten days, and he took out the family's passages in it. He was in such a feverish haste to fulfil his own intentions and his wife's dying request that he would not hear of any obstacle. He gave Kirsten carte blanche to provide all that was necessary for herself and the children, and have it ready without delay. He hurried her, as if he were afraid she would find the rapid exodus impossible at the last moment. He seemed as anxious to get the leave-taking past, as if he lived in terror of breaking down and discovering himself unable, when the time came to part with all his family, as he had been forced to part with little Mary and Mrs. Owen. The difficult task of preparing herself and the three children, in a few days, for a long voyage would have furnished trouble and turmoil enough in itself, even if it had not been intensified by the excited condition of the two elder children, who behaved as if no children had ever gone to Europe before. The im-"], [77, "Kirsten accepts the Commission. 65 pending trials of the baby formed a distinct aspect. She was to part from the nurse whom she naturally regarded as her mother, but who was not to cross the seas with her charge. On the contrary, this domestic tyrant was grudgingly, and with a thousand prognostications of evil, inculcating a skeleton out line of her duties on a less expensive and many years younger successor, who in consideration of being carried gratis to England, to which she had a tender tie, consented to fill the vacant post and make her self generally useful for a moderate wage. Curiously enough, the deepest regret experienced by Kirsten in quitting Australia within three months of landing in it was the little she had seen of the great strange colony. She was in her quiet way eminently social and friendly, but there was also something of the soul of a great traveller in the thoroughly domestic young woman. \" I am going back to England, and I have never been in the bush or tasted damper, or set eyes on opossum or spoken with a native,\" she pondered with half-comical ruefulness. \" Mrs. Addington says I shall be able to say I have seen Australia, but that will be about all \u2014 like the glimpse of French land which a stay-at-home Briton gets from the cliffs of Dover or Folkestone. Ah ! but I have seen other stars in another sky ; I possess them if I have at tained to nothing else. I wonder if all my inherit ance henceforth is to be in the sky ? \" F"], [78, "66 Her Gentle Deeds. The last evening, the last morning, with the trans fer to the ship, arrived. All those who had shared Kirsten's faithful service and watch in the Owens' house parted from her with respectful but hearty good-will. \" Good will go with you, miss, wherever you go,\" the rather saturnine cook said emphatically*. A lazy, supercilious follower of the housemaid's, who was eating his head because he was too \" high \" for the colonies, and declined to put himself about even in the service of his Eliza, was so moved by the ac counts he had received of the departing young lady that he scouted the assistance ofa porter, constituted himself a beast of burden in the removal of the modest luggage, and looked hurt and mournful over the necessity of accepting the smallest remuneration. Mr. Owen betrayed a good deal of emotion when the final moment of separation came. He did not burden the children with injunctions to write to him, or avail himself of his unimpaired credit in this respect by indulging in extensive promises of writing to them in return. But he told them repeatedly to be good children and always mind Miss Stewart. He bade Katie prove a credit to her poor mother, and even recommended Beville to grow up a better man than his father. Mrs. Addington had driven down to the ship to take farewell of Kirsten, and stood apart with her while the father kissed and hugged his children."], [79, "Kirsten accepts the Commission. 67 At the eleventh hour a dim sense of the treasure she was losing had come across the lady's fickle, impres sionable mind, and she felt inclined after all to resent Kirsten's going with her, Mrs. Addington's, leave, as a problematical injury to herself. \"Just after I had come to know you, my dear, when one never can tell what may happen,\" she said reproach fully. \" If we do go up to Mr. Addington's station, you might have been a comfort and good company. But at least,\" the speaker nodded complacently, \" we have become acquainted with each other as we never could have done by letter. We shall never lose sight of each other now, shall we, dear ? We shall always have something to write about, since you have been to Australia and seen my home and the children, and since you and Mr. Addington are no longer personal strangers. I have learned what a good, reasonable, sweet girl my precious sister's daughter is, and you have got an inkling\" \u2014 the speaker became a little frolicsome at this point, perhaps to rid herself of a secret qualm \u2014 \" that Mr. Addington and I are not such bad ' bodies ' after all, though we have not everything in our power.

Women must never interfere with its iron fetters, if they would have any peace, as you will know some day when you get a husband of your own.\" \" I should be very sorry to interfere with Mr. Addington's business,\" said Kirsten, with grave sincerity. \" Besides, there is no occasion for his putting himself about when you are here.\" \" Quite true, Kirsten, though I assure you he would have thought nothing of the trouble. Well, what he desired me to tell you was a report which he said you might not have heard ; though why it should be kept secret from you of all people, I cannot fathom. However, Mr. Addington called it a secret which he had only come to know in a round-about, chance manner yesterday. Mr. Owen is on the point of resigning his office and going up the country, possibly to one of the diggings. I do not wonder at it, for a man is lost without his wife.\" \" I did not hear it,\" said Kirsten, \" though he talked of breaking up his establishment,\" she added thoughtfully. \" Perhaps he did not wish to say more in case it should come to the children's ears and make it worse for them when their excitement flags.

Beville said it would be jolly to come and water them, and he would carry dear baby to see them, forgetting that neither will be babies if they live to see those days. But it is natural enough for Mr. Owen to propose to leave Sydney ; and, except for the grave, any other place will be much the same to the children, when the life here has faded from their minds ; that is, if they should ever come back to the Colony.\" \" There, everybody is preparing to go,\" cried Mrs. Addington, drawing her lace shawl round her shoulders and catching up her parasol. \" I must take leave of you, my love ; bon voyage a thousand times. Many happy days in old England. So glad to have seen my dear sister's child.\" \" Much as I have seen Australia,' Kirsten could not help thinking to herself dryly ; but she had settled long ago, in her own mind, that the poor woman could not help having a shallow, versatile nature; and Kirsten had to hurry away to the assistance of Mr. Owen and everybody, for it could not be expected that Katie would dislike a scene ; Beville, though a manly little fellow, restraining his feelings to the last gasp, was safe to howl when he put his fists into his eyes ; even the baby would join the chorus, since her keeper, a self-indulgent young"], [82, "Her Gentle Deeds 70 woman, did not attempt to mind what she was about on the children's account, or to restrain her grief in tearing herself away from such friends as she left in Australia. In the middle of the hubbub, Kirsten could merely exchange a hasty shake of the hand with Mr. Owen before she saw him turn hastily away and disappear in the retreating throng. The next instant her every faculty was demanded by the children."], [83, "CHAPTER VI. IN THE \" PRINCE ARTHUR.\" IRSTEN had been weeks at sea without much intermission in her cares, or any save the slenderest opportunity of hold- ing intercourse with her fellow-passengers. Her office of escort and representative mistress of the family was no sinecure. Katie and Beville needed constant looking after, checking, and controlling, if they would not be suffered to become general nuisances or to rush into temptation or danger. The baby, too, fell into Kirsten's hands, as the ship encountered stormy weather, and the young nurse showed herself as incapable of resisting sea-sickness as sorrow. She confined herself to her berth in the most premonitory or convalescent stages of the com plaint without a scruple. Kirsten entered on a severe apprenticeship to baby keeping when she was herself often disqualified for the task, and when she had also the serious complication of Katie and Beville on her hands. Kirsten's arms suffered a chronic ache from the unaccustomed load. Her mind was racked by anxiety"], [84, "Her Gentle Deeds. 72 lest she should not accomplish, to the baby's comforL and weU-being, all the mysteries of bath, toilet, and meals, with regard to which Katie was torturingly hypercritical in officiously pointing out every blunder. Kirsten wore out her own spirits with ceaseless devices to keep her animated bundle from becoming dull or cross, and crying till it grew red and blue on all occasions, and with getting it to sleep before it had disturbed every passenger literally within cr)\\ Her office lasted from six o'clock to the small hours. It might be fun to Katie and Beville, and even in a small counter-balancing degree to the maid, Lucinda, who stood out for her full name, when thc footing in the little cabin was so unsteady thai Kirsten, dreading she would topple over with thc living burden in her arms, had herself lashed to Lucinda, with Lucinda lashed to her berth, before the amateur nurse attempted to make a small progress across the rocking floor ; but though Kirsten was as humorous as many, the difficulty rather than the comicality ofthe situation was foremost in her mind. Lucinda, finding that her relinquished task was quietly taken up and sedulously performed by Miss Stewart, calmly abdicated her post and subsided into an interesting invalid, or at most an agreeable com panion for the rest of the voyage. Here the strain of weakness in Kirsten's character became visible ; as she was good in obeying she should have been good in governing ; but she had the"], [85, "In the \" Prince Arthur. 73 greatest reluctance to exact from another any service she could do for herself. To reprimand and com mand were distasteful to her. Those of the passengers who were at leisure to remark Kirsten's labours day and night for thc children, conceived that as she was too young to be their mother, she must be the most devoted of aunts. The question of such a relationship started the idea in the children's plastic minds. \" Oh ! do let us call you 'Auntie,' Miss Stewart,\" urged Katie, hugging Kirsten in a slightly oppressive way which the child had sometimes. \" It sounds so much nicer than Miss Stewart, which is so stiff, and does not make us feel as if we had anybody belonging to us.\" \"Auntie Stewart, Auntie Stewart, Auntie Stewart,\" shouted Beville with the senseless reiteration of childhood. But Kirsten was mindful of two objections. She thought that poor Mrs. Owen, who had held herself so far aloof from her dependents till circumstances proved too much for her, would have repudiated the imagi nary connection. Kirsten had also a strong sympathy with the motive of the old Dutch lady's speech when she insisted in her limited English vocabulary, with a foreign prolongation of her r's, \" The tr-ruth is the tr-ruth.\" \"We are so fond of you, Miss Stewart, you might let us say 'Aunt,' \" cajoled Katie. \" You may be quite as fond of me under the name"], [86, "Her Gentle Deeds. 74 of ' Miss Stewart,' Katie. What's in a name ? Wh)*, I may be adored as ' Miss Stewart.' \" \"Adored! no, that would be idolatry,\" corrected Katie. \" That would be very wrong, Miss Stewart.\" \" Hold your tongue, Kattens. Miss Stewart can not do wrong,\" interposed Beville, indignantly emphasizing his contradiction by administering a re sounding thump on Katie's back, then, retreating to the opposite end of the cabin, he further \" shied \" \u2014 to borrow one of his expressions \u2014 baby's stockings, lying conveniently to hand, at his sister. Katie ducked her head to avoid the missile, which, missing the mark, hit Kirsten unexpectedly on the nose, to the mingled consternation, delight, and consequent reconciliation of the children. \"You are two foolish chicks,\" retorted Kirsten, smoothing down the aggrieved feature, \" therefore, in the meantime, I can do no wrong, for you \u2014 just as there was no plural in German grammar for an aspir ing beginner pestering the teacher by forestalling his explanations, instead of minding the business of the moment\u2014' There is no plural for you.' I can do no wrong for you till you are big and have sense, so that I had better continue Miss Stewart. But that is not to hinder you from caring for me,\" finished Kirsten with a little relenting.

There was a hale and hearty Scotch couple, a farmer and his wife, who, like Kirsten's former friends, had been adventurous enough to go all the long road to Australia to visit a son settled there. But they had possessed an addi tional and powerful reason for what in their case was to be only a temporary stay. They had carried with them an only daughter, a young girl \" far gone in consumption.\" They had fondly trusted that the dry warm air of the most favourable portion of the great island might arrest her disease ; and they had made up their minds to the incalculable sacrifice of leaving her behind them with her brother if a mode rate degree of health and a continuance of life could be secured to her, thousands of miles away from the old Dumfriesshire farm in which the parents' lot was cast. The tender, heart-breaking project was in vain ; the girl had been no better of the change of climate, and the father and mother were bringing her back with them, reconciled in a small measure to their sore disappointment by the assurance that she was still theirs to die in their arms. Kirsten's heart warmed to such a couple \u2014 the more because they"], [88, "76 Her Gentle Deeds. were Scotch ; and she was interested in the trifling coincidence that the poor girl's name happened to be \" Kirsten \" like her own. She could not help contrasting the fate of the two Kirstens \u2014 that of the doted-on invalid, whose every movement was watched and hung over by the loving protectors, who had cared for her from infancy up to womanhood, and that of the girl left alone in the world to give her life to strangers, to shelter others, but no more to be sheltered in her turn. As Kirsten kept the baby and stood guard on Katie and Beville in her place on deck during the good weather, she often occupied herself watching with wistful pity the hectically pretty, frequently \u2014 God help her ! \u2014 querulous girl, established among her cloaks and shawls, waited upon as though she had been a queen, and the devoted father and mother the humblest of her retainers, bound to her by a thousand favours. Katie and Beville were not always naughty, poor children. They were sometimes unimpeachable in bright winning ways, when Katie forgot to play a part or to air her superiority to the world of girls and Beville had no small mischief in hand. Then, when the baby was also moderately flourishing, Kirsten found time to enjoy the fresh salt air, with the aspects of the sea and sky under glorious sunsets and magnificent moonlights. But one day both of the elder children, the one"], [89, "In the \" Prince Arthur.\" 77 after the other, fell into vexatious scrapes. Katie went and made up to the great lady of the voyage, who did not think anybody else in the ship worthy to be spoken to, whose dictum in this respect had been so far confirmed that she was left to her own com pany, and that of her maid and man, in dignified seclusion. This great personage had sufficient womanly instincts not yet fossilized in her to pre vent her from annihilating the audacious little in truder on her privacy on the spot ; but the victim took occasion to send an imperious message to Kirsten within the hour, that Mrs. Combermere would thank the person who had charge of a fair haired pert little girl of nine or ten on board, to look after her and keep her in her proper place, which was certainly not to put herself in the way of a lady and annoy her with children's chatter. \" Oh, for shame, Katie ! How could you bring down such a rebuke on yourself and me?\" cried Kirsten to the slightly discomfited offender, who was still sufficiently herself to protest. \" Well, Miss Stewart, I thought the lady looked lonely, and, as nobody went up and spoke to her, I had better take a little notice of her. I only asked her if she had been at sea when she was a girl like me; that is if she could recollect, for it must be such a long time ago ; and whether she was as good a sailor as I am. Oh, and I offered to show her how I was working my sachet in crewels ! and"], [90, "78 Her Gentle Deeds. I said she might learn if she were quick and took pains.\" \"My dear Katie, I am afraid you are incorrigible,\" declared Kirsten with a groan. \" I know you did not mean any harm, but will you never wait to be noticed ? Are you incapable of understanding that is a child's, ay, even the best man or woman's part ? Can nobody persuade you, not with all the nice work you see done by the grown-up people round you, that a little girl's poor, trifling bungle of a piece of needle-work is not a subject for observation and imitation?\" Kirsten had not done lecturing Katie when Beville was brought before her, making a stony face, for to do him justice he was above impudence as he was beyond dissimulation for its own sake. An angry seaman held the child by the jacket. \" Would you keep this dratted imp of a boy \u2014 you'll forgive the freedom \u2014 beside you, marm, and hinder him from corrupting lads as have nothing save their characters to depend upon ? Here are all the trumpery buttons which he gave in exchange for them shells as is bulging his breeches pockets at this blessed moment.\" Beville had an inextinguishable spirit of barter in him, which might have marked him out to discrimi nating eyes as a born merchant, like the German boy who was so careful in the disposal ofhis peach-stone, in one of the well-beloved fables of the Fatherland."], [91, "In the \" Prince Arthur.\" 79 Beville's trial of wit on this occasion had been with a cabin-boy, who chanced to be the nephew of the able-bodied seaman denouncing the culprit to Kirsten. The coveted possession had been some worthless shells, for which Beville had exchanged the little studs and wrist-buttons which had set off his dress suit. The small trader had been misled in the trans action, like the great Franklin with the whistle, and had paid too dear for his fancy ; but he persisted, against all testimony, in preferring the shells, which he was compelled to disgorge. He looked ruefully after them as they were inexorably forfeited, and turned disdainfully from the restored buttons. He was stubborn in his error of judgment while he gave no sign of penitence, though Katie added her lecture to Kirsten's, which to Kirsten looked in this instance a little like Satan reproving Sin. The child con tinued obdurate till he came to offer his good-night kiss to Kirsten. \" Good night, Beville,\" she answered ; \" but it would be a mockery to kiss me to-night. You don't care for my good opinion, and so you have dis appointed and hurt me. You promised not to use any more of your things instead of money, unless you told somebody who would know whether you were at liberty to dispose of them, and whether you were making a fair exchange. You had no right to give away your buttons, which are not really yours to do with as you like. They are part of your"], [92, "Her Gentle Deeds. 80 clothes, entrusted to your care by your papa to bc lawfully used, not needlessly wasted and destroyed. But to barter them is far worse than to spoil them by recklessness. If you don't take care, Beville, I am afraid you will end by establishing a newspaper with exchange sheets ten times as full as those in the Queen, or perhaps you will found the biggest barter shop for goods in kind \u2014 a sort of improved pawn broker's \u2014 in Sydney^.\" The prospect, so far as it was understood, turned out the reverse of disagreeable to Beville, but he could not get over Miss Stewart's refusing to kiss him when he said good-night. She had never omitted the salute before, but had seemed to put some value on it, as if she liked the little ceremony, till in punishing him she showed herself willing to submit to a deprivation herself. This added an amount of seriousness to the quarrel and heinousness to the delinquency which lay at the bottom of it. Then Kirsten remembered the little lad had no mother with a mother's readiness to condone an offence, and soften the sinner's heart by the long suffering, unfailing love of her kiss. She felt her heart smite her for the tremendous austerity of her sentence, and went and kissed the child as he was falling asleep. \" I'm sorry I 'fended you, Miss Stewart,\" mut tered Beville drowsily, but contritely. \" I won't go in for bargains again.\""], [93, "In the \" Prince Arthur.\" 81 The next day was oppressively warm and still, with the sea like molten lead under the haze of heat. Everybody saw the children seemed languid. Katie and Beville were playing at some game in which manslaughter was committed with impunity. The one child was supposed to stab the other, and Katie, displaying an inclination to realism, was heard regretting that she had only a paper knife, and not even a penknife wherewith to inflict the fatal wound. Kirsten, idly listening, was fain to tell the children a tale which had made an impression on her own mind. There were two little Welsh boys who dwelt in a remote mountain village. The children were not brothers, but neighbours of five or six years, who, on account of nearness of age and habitation, trotted about constantly together, played their little plays in uniform concert, and were peculiarly attached to each other. On a particular day the great event of the village took place, and naturally attracted the Tom Thumb comrades. The pig, just then in full growth, was to be killed, and the butcher, a respect able, responsible man, the father of a young family of his own, was summoned to do the deed. In his desire to accomplish the feat in the neatest style, Mr. Morgan, the butcher, with the full consent of his employer, started on a five minutes' walk to an outlying cottage to borrow the best bench in the place, a favourite bench for the purpose. In the meantime, to save carriage and to make himself G"], [94, "Her Gentle Deeds. 82 smart, he unfastened and took off his long knife and his apron, and laid them where they should be await ing him on the scene of action. Says little Davy Richards to little Taff Jones, in their native Welsh, as they toddled about in anticipation of the curtain rising, so to speak, on the drama, \" Let us have a play at pig-killing, Taff.\" \" Hooray ! \" shouted Taff enthusiastically. \" I'll put on the apron, and you'll take the knife.\" \" No, no,\" corrected Davy, \" we ain't both butchers. I am the pig,\" he announced with a skip, exulting in the character he was about to assume, and in the opportunity afforded them of doing something twice as good as the halting farce Taff proposed. \" I lie down and squeak, but you must kill me first.\" No sooner said than done. The horrified butcher, coming up at the moment, found little Davy bathed in his life-blood. Taff, with his baby arm had wielded the butcher's knife only too effectually, and copied his performance too closely. The gaily begun imitation squeak had ended in a spontaneous gurgling sob of mortal agony. Never were comedy and tragedy more terribly blended than in the mere play of these poor children. Davy only lived long enough to confirm by a faint monosyllable the stam mering tale ofthe appalled little Taff, whose dismay and distress did not altogether die out of his infant mind , though he could not suffer such concentrated self-"], [95, "In the \" Prince Arthur.\" 83 reproach as made the stout butcher lose nerve and flesh until he fell a victim within the year to the next epidemic which visited the village. The child who had so innocently contracted the stain of blood missed and pined for his playfellow, of whom he would prattle pathetically at intervals for months, even years ; and at the most distant sound of a pig-killing in the village, he would rush away, hide his blanched face, and shake in every limb. Kirsten's story was received with a burst of passionate tears, which did not prevent a host of relevant and irrelevant questions from Katie ; but Beville stood silent, with open mouth, and only a dimming of his blue eyes. \" Poor little beggars ! \" he said softly. \" Oh, poor little beggars ! \" g 2"], [96, "CHAPTER VII A LIGHTNING FLASH HAT night there was a violent thunder fl storm, which caused Kirsten to hurry gjl the children from the deck and antedate their usual hour of going to bed ; not that either Katie or Beville were frightened by the crash of the thunder or the gleam of the lightning. What modern child is so much as awed by the solemnity of a thunder-storm ? Yet Beville was a little subdued under his bravado, if he had been quite at liberty to show what he felt. He did whisper. while Katie was labouring to induct him with her own very original theory of electricity, \" Don't talk, Kattens; it 'ain't polite to talk when God Almighty's speaking. Hasn't Miss Stewart said that it is God's voice breaking the cedars of Lebanon ? \" Then he was in terror lest he should have com promised his manliness, and added as an amendment to his speech \u2014 \"Not that I should mind being out in such a flare up. It would be just jolly.\""], [97, "A Lightning Flash. 85 \" Miss Stewart, Beville is calling the thunder storm a ' flare-up,' \" reported Katie in high disgust. After the children had fallen asleep, and the storm sounded as if it were passing away, Kirsten was startled, and at a loss to account for the sudden commotion she heard overhead. Had somebody been struck by the electric fluid when the storm was at its height, and had the accident only been dis covered now ? \" Lord-a-mercy ! what's that, miss ? \" cried Lucinda, who had been lying for a long time with her fingers in her ears, and her head buried in the bed-clothes ; but she had begun to shake herself up with the comfortable conviction that the danger was over. It was a noise like the first blast of a \" rushing, mighty wind,\" and at the same moment the tread of many feet hurrying to and fro could be dis tinguished still more plainly overhead. The next instant the cabin door, which had not been locked for the night, was pushed open by a fellow-passenger, who, in fleeing to rescue what he could of his worldly goods, and make the best flight, in the extremity remembered the little family. \" Ship on fire ! \" he cried, as if he were reading a telegram, with the terseness bred of imminent peril, and much to do if salvation were to be attained. \" Lightning caught shrouds \u2014 extending fast \u2014 no rain fallen \u2014 accident not seen at once \u2014 may be put out yet, but"], [98, "86 Her Gentle Deeds. better prepare for the worst \u2014 all hands on deck \u2014 take what can be carried in case boats launched.\" The excited figure vanished like the lightning which had caused the disaster. It might have cost that man his life and what worldly goods remained to him, to deliver the brief, fragmentary announce ment. Kirsten stood stock still and dumb for an instant, while Lucinda uttered a loud wail, which awoke all the three children at once. Then Kirsten showed herself able to command under certain circum stances. \" Help me to take up and dress the children. Be silent, woman, if you value your life ! \" At that appeal, Lucinda's piercing shriek subsided into a quavering cry, which matched the uncon scious weeping of the baby, while Katie and Beville trembled and whimpered, but were submissive in the shock of the surprise. In a very few minutes Kirsten had her troop ready. They stumbled on deck, forming one of the many scared groups rapidly assembling there amidst the tumult, rising louder and louder, of terror and desperate effort to cope with the mighty enemy, which had sprung upon them out of the storm-cloud like a tiger from its lair. There was already a red glow from that part of the ship where the damage had been done, throwing a brightness beyond that of noon-day over the immediate vicinity, darkening the"], [99, "A Lightning Flash. 87 night-lights, and shrouding the rest of the vessel in deeper obscurity. Happily, the wind was in a favourable direction for blowing out to sea the sparks, which threatened still further to endanger the vessel, and the blinding, stifling volumes of smoke. But as good and evil are inextricably blended in this world, the direction of the wind formed one reason why the mischief had not been sooner discovered. There was an additional mis fortune in the fact that the wind, which had slumbered during the day, was not only awake, but rising to a stiff breeze, and fanning the flames. There had been little or no rain as yet with the storm, and, since dry weather had prevailed for some time before, everything was in the most com bustible state. But there was a good captain, a well-disciplined crew, a fire-engine in perfect order, and no want of volunteers to replenish the line of men plying buckets as well as hose. When Kirsten could judge for herself she saw there was far less disorder than might have been expected. There was well-warranted confidence in the officers and sailors. Hope could not readily die out of the hearts of the passengers, among whom the men for the most part were eager to lend a hand in fighting the foe for their own lives and the lives of those dear to them, and perhaps with God's blessing beating it back and coming off victorious. Even"], [100, "Her Gentle Deeds. 88 the women, huddled together on the poop, as far from the fire as possible, with their teeth chattering a little in spite of the sultry night, beginning to acquire a fresh horrible sultriness, were still able to listen to the encouraging reports of the men, and the cheering reassurances from the ship's officers. The first to lose her head was the unlucky appendage, Lucinda.' \" Oh dear ! oh dear ! \" she took to sobbing and screaming anew, \" to think that I went for to leave Australia to be roasted alive like this. Whatever shall I do ? God have mussy on my sins ! And I shall never see my true love Bill \u2014 as he signed hisself \u2014 no, never no more ! \" Kirsten was sorry for the poor creature, but she was forced to remonstrate with her vigorously, and reproach her sharply. \" You have not so much as a singe upon you yet, Lucinda, and please God you may never have ; but is He likely to have more mercy upon you and me if we have none upon others ? Upon His little ones, for instance, these children He has given us, whom you are doing your best to frighten out of their wits by ill-chosen words with frightful associations ? Oh, woman ! what poor love you have for him you call your true love, if you think that death can separate you, if your love is not stronger than death, whether it come soon or late, peacefully or violently.\" Lucinda's dismal moan roused other moans, more"], [101, "A Lightning Flash. 89 or less restrained, and the greatest harm was done, so far as the children were concerned, at the words \" roasted alive.\" Katie became convulsed with real hysterics, and Beville flung himself down, with his face on the planks, to smother the roar bursting from his lips. \" My dear little lambs, don't mind her,\" pleaded Kirsten ; \" listen to me. Katie, you are almost a woman in some things ; Beville, you are my little man. See, all these brave men and kind gentlemen are doing their utmost to help us. They have not given in ; they still trust to put out the fire, else they would leave it to take its way. And even at the worst, would God abandon us ? Would He not hold us still, as He holds both the water and the fire, in the hollow of His hand ? Would it be so hard to go without further delay to your own mamma, whom you were so sorry to lose only the other day, while I shall go to my dear old father and mother, of whom I have sometimes told you ? You know many a Bible story; have you forgotten them all when it is fittest you should remember them ? Who walked with Daniel in the furnace ? Who went to meet His disciples on the sea ? Who calls Himself the Good Shepherd, and carries the lambs in His bosom ; Oh, my darlings ! you need not be afraid.\" \" Do you think He will come on deck and put out the fire ? \" gasped Katie."], [102, "Her Gentle Deeds. 90 \" It will not be worse than happened to the poor little Welsh boys,\" Beville rolled himself over to remind her. \" If you will hold me tight, Miss Stewart, for Kattens and me, we must hold by each other, then we shall all be together.\" After a pause he added, with a shade of buoyancy returning to his voice, \" After I have seen my mamma, you will take me with you to see your mamma and papa, won't you ? \" At that minute the very seaman who had brought Beville to book for his last bit of naughtiness hurried past. Chancing to catch a glimpse of the little face, with its attempt at courage, and its ghost of a smile, the man cried out, \" Come, you are a brave little guv'nor after all. I won't lose sight of you, my hearty, any more than of my sister's lad up there, if the worst comes to the worst.\" The opportune words steadied and warmed Kir sten's quaking, chilling heart, quaking and chilling in spite of her faith and devotion in the face of what might be the awful ordeal before her. The fire appeared to grow less and less, to be really yielding to the indefatigable exertions to subdue it. Eager congratulations, now assuming a tone of deep thankfulness, and again of wild gaiety, already resounded on all sides. In the comfort of this belief, which their own eyes and ears confirmed, Katie and Beville, the baby, and even Lucinda, worn out by unusual wakefulness, fright, and misery,"], [103, "A Lightning Flash. 91 with the mercurial attribute which is the inheritance of the very young and ignorant, actually fell asleep, or dozed, nestling among the wraps with which Kirsten's mindfulness had provided them. Kirsten was left alone to watch and ascertain that the fire, like other slaves aspiring to become masters, had more than one lull and fresh outbreak, till it seemed to have taken a firmer hold, and to be rising into a more glowing pyramid than ever. Premature congratulations were replaced by lamentations, low at first, waxing louder and louder, and, when Kirsten distinguished an order to lower a boat, it rang in her ear like the knell of their first chance of escape. Would the noble cry arise again, as she had read of its being uttered in similar straits, \" Women and children first ! \" Then she remarked that there was quite a crowd of women and children, far more than would fill the boat, gathered waiting at the point from which it was to be lowered. It would be useless for her to rouse the children and press forward. Other boats must follow ; she would leave the children undisturbed to the last, for that matter they would be more easily removed asleep than awake. But as for Lucinda, she had started up and rushed aft. She was struggling frantically to push her way and secure a place among the claimants for instant rescue, utterly heedless of whom or what she left behind. It was such an example of clamorous, base cowardice as has frequently proved fatal to"], [104, "Her Gentle Deeds. 92 more than the offender in a common human ex tremity. Withal, the evil was contagious where one would have least looked for the poison to spread. A ghastly sense of desolation rushed upon Kirsten. Her loneliness was brought home to her with terrible force by the desertion of Lucinda. She could not forget herself at this moment, when there was no one else to think of her and fight for her. She could not forsake the children as the other girl had forsaken them. Yet they were no children of hers any more than of Lucinda's. A temptation to selfishness so horrible to her that it sickened her while it clutched at her heart-strings, seized hold of her. She had done her very best for these children, who had been imposed upon her, as she knew very well, quite as much by the selfishness of their father as by his regard for their welfare. Was she called upon to sacrifice herself for them ? There might be room for one in the boat, when three were out of the question, at least, so Lucinda had calculated. Kir sten might call attention to the sleeping children, and beg that they should be put into the next boat. The sailor who had promised to look after Beville would also see after Katie and the baby. If they perished they would meet their fate asleep, locked in each others' arms, and could death come better to young, innocent souls ? While death was thus simplified and smoothed down for them, visions of life in its sweetness swept with surpassing vividness"], [105, "A Lightning Flash. gj across \"Kirsten's mind, as a drowning man's whole life is said to pass in keen review before him with his last few gasps. Two pictures were specially promi nent \u2014 a summer's morning, with the sun shining, the dew glistening, the birds singing, the roses blooming, the mower whetting his scythe, the country women coming into market, and herself standing on the door-step of the old home at Haythorpe, fain to acknowledge that though death was in the world life was good. The other vision was a winter afternoon, when she had come back from a brisk walk along the frost bound road between the hedges, powdered white, across the foot-bridge over the brook, with the icicles hanging thick, by the pond where the boys were sliding and the men and women skating, as Kirsten herself had sometimes skated long after the moon rose. But she was within doors now, holding her benumbed fingers to the fire, with its mild, yellow gleam, and slight, pleasant crackle on the hearth. She was looking round to see that the tea table was set, the lamp lit, and her needle-work and book lying together, awaiting her. True the house place was not merely silent, there lingered a mourn ful echo of dear voices which had died out of its still brightness. Nevertheless, there was satisfaction in its comfort, peace, and abundant occupation, while all that was sensuous in her turned with a sudden unconquerable revulsion from the dark, cold grave,"], [106, "Her Gentle Deeds. 94 for which, in other moods, she had yearned. But that was a grave in the restful, familiar churchyard of Haythorpe, at the feet of her father and mother, after she had endured the ordinary wasting of an ordinary illness, and had died on her bed. She had not thought to be caught up in the prophet's chariot of fire, to have her bleached bones driven by the winds and the waves from shore to shore. This wild death, these unburied, unresting bones, formed too grand and terrible an end for a simple, homely woman. There had been some delay in lowering thc boat. In the middle of the pause a quick sharp cry reached Kirsten where she sat, and sounded like a strange supernatural commentary on her thoughts. It was her own name, \" Kirsten,\" followed by the words, \" Oh ! where are you ? come this minute,\" uttered in accents of passionate, imploring summons. Were her father and mother permitted to draw near her in the border-land between life and death in which she stood ? Were they calling to her across the gulf to suffer herself to be saved ? Nay, it was another father and mother in search of their Kirsten, from whom, in their half frantic struggle to secure special provision for her need, and because of their tender care for her infirmities, they had been separated in the commotion. Yet of all to whom unkind, cruel death was brought near, there seemed none to whom it could"], [107, "A Lightning Flash. 95 be less of an evil than this poor Kirsten. She was the only invalid on board, and she was a hopeless invalid. A month or two at most would in all probability end her doomed life. Were these weeks of increasing suffering and prolonged death so much worth preserving? Were the fierce scorching and suffocation which would be over in not many more minutes than it takes to tell the woeful tale, so much worse than hectic fever and wasting lungs, which would throb in every pulse, and pant in every breath, till life ebbed out, as water trickles drop by drop, while the conscious victim was called on to contemplate every stage of the grievous process, to anticipate the deadly weariness and faintness of the end ? These thoughts had already crossed Kirsten's mind in the course of the last couple of hours heaped up with former experience, as she had caught glimpses of the faithful father and mother, forgetful of themselves even in these supreme moments \u2014 he with snatched-up pillows, she dragging a down quilt, and both supporting with their disengaged arms the feeble, agitated girl, who ought in the course of nature to have supported and shielded her parents. Kirsten had asked herself whether in the appalling tempest of misery these loving people would not be spared some pangs ? Whether it would not be a consolation to them all to die together ? Yet here was the agonised cry, \" Kirsten ! Kir-"], [108, "Her Gentle Deeds. 96 sten ! \" which Kirsten Stewart might obey as if she had taken it for a call to herself, as it might indeed prove in another sense a sign that she was the Kirsten to be rescued for a long, useful career. It was not the poor \" spent, fractious lassie,\" who could not long survive the most prosperous voyage, who had somehow slipped through the fingers and been lost sight of by those who would have given their own lives for hers, possibly because she had fallen down insensible, or lay dead already where she had fallen, and all the time another girl, young as she was, strong and capable as she was not, with a full life before her, wanted the place which would be wasted on the dying Kirsten. Kirsten Stewart could not hope for a moment, even if she had been capable of committing the fraud, to impose herself when the confusion was wildest upon the wretched pair. But she might protest that she was a second Kirsten who had answered to their call. She might declare that she had as good a right to be saved as the first girl, and the new comer might strengthen the hands of those pas sengers who were growing desperately impatient, well-nigh furious at the stoppage, and urging that the lives of many were not to be risked for that of one. Further, if the lost Kirsten's father and mother, in the abandonment of their despair, let a craven, selfish spirit tempt them as it was tempting Kirsten Stewart, and permitted themselves to be pushed"], [109, "A Lightning Flash. 97 empty-handed into the boat, then she might devote the rest of her days to making up to them for the in voluntary injury she had inflicted on them. She would be to them instead of the daughter who must have soon gone from them in any circumstances. Or if the hapless pair were left behind they might find their daughter, alive or dead, by the time the next boat, which was sure to be lowered, had taken off more of the passengers, including the little Owens. What ! would she, Kirsten Stewart, risk meeting the mother of these children when her own time came, face her reproachful glance, listen to her accusing words, \" What have you done with my children that were intrusted to your care, bad and faithless ser vant ? \" Would she risk meeting her own father and seeing the misery of his humiliation ? \"I was an erring man, but I was also a loyal soldier in my day, where did my daughter get the spirit which made her a traitress?\" And hear her mother's wailing re sponse, \" Not from me, Dugald ; I was an erring woman, but I never failed any mortal that put con fidence in me.\" And would Kirsten dare to meet the sorrowful shame of His eyes who could remind her, \" My worst enemies said of Me, He saved others, Himself He cannot save ? \" Could she bear to remember that when Beville started from his sleep with glaring eyes and fiery fingers, and the breath as of the fire upon him, there would be no Miss Stewart to hold him tight, while H"], [110, "98 Her Gentle Deeds. with the other hand she clasped the baby to her breast, and helped Katie to put up for them all, their last earthly prayer ? The lonely, simple, sensitive girl was fitter to perish by a thousand violent deaths than to be guilty of such an abandonment of her trust, when the devil which had been resisted fled from her abashed. A calm fell upon Kirsten, her mind grew clearer than it had been throughout the catastrophe, she was able to see with comparative composure that the boat was lowered and instantly filled, as it shot across the tract of red light which the burning ship cast on the sea. She could recognise three faces. Lucinda was there, thrust by her own exertions into a prominent place. And not only were the father and mother of the other Kirsten among the boat's occupants, they must have found their lost daughter in the act of starting, for there she was too, lying with her head on her father's shoulder, her wan face rosy from the re flected glare, while her mother grasped the girl's hands as if the older woman still congratulated her self in an ecstasy over her recovered treasure. Kirsten congratulated herself also with an impulse of pure generosity. When she looked round again she saw Beville's friendly antagonist at her elbow. His generally smart enough sailor's clothes were thoroughly begrimed, and he was wiping the sweat drops from his forehead, but he spoke as briskly as ever."], [111, "A Lightning Flash. 99 \" Keep up your heart, marm, there are more boats, and you'll be the next to go, I'll see to that ere.

We shan't give in and allow this darned fire to have it all to itself\u2014 not yet a bit. There ain't a pinch of powder on board, so we've time to look round. We're right in the track of ships, and that first boat needn't have been in such a funk to put off; but some folks \u2014 like your young 'oman, marm \u2014 never know when they are well off. Why, the skies may send us help yet, before all is done.\" Sure enough the words were not out ofhis mouth, when a great rain-drop splashed on the brown leathern skin of his hand, and with a triumphant, \" There, didn't I tell ee so ? \" he pulled some tarpaulin farther over the little party, and rolled off to the heart of the scene of action. Kirsten had never so welcomed a refreshing shower on her parched garden as she hailed the rush of that tropical rain-fall, which hissed and spluttered on the blaze in front of her. The deluge certainly delayed the ruin which was too far advanced to be more than checked, and it was under its nearly blinding auspices that the look-out shouted the still gladder tidings, \" Ship ahoy ! \" Kirsten, believing that all would now be saved, took fresh courage and thanked God fervently ; and H 2"], [112, "Her Gentle Deeds. 100 within less than an hour after midnight every remain ing passenger, together with the crew and captain, were safe on board the Britannia, another English screw steamer bound likewise for London. The cargo of wool had to be left to its fate, but the mails and much of the passengers' luggage were recovered before the smouldering, and, at last, water-logged Prince Arthur was suffered to fall to lee. Kirsten, amidst the chattering of the children in their new quarters, could not help wondering gratefully, with a reviving sense of amusement, how one could be burnt out, at sea too, with so little damage. There was some anxiety for the welfare of the boat which had left the ship, but it turned up in the course of the following day, with weary rowers and an ex hausted company, one of whom, however, had passed beyond all bodily weariness, though she could hardly be said to have died ofthe exposure. The sick Kirsten had been in a fainting fit, from the shock of the fire, when she was discovered and lifted into the boat. She never regained consciousness but had mercifully died, pillowed and succoured to the last, as her earliest infancy had been cared for.

ARRIVED IN HOWARD STREET. IHE Britannia sailed safely into the docks within a reasonable time of the date fixed for its arrival, as if there were no such things as fires and wrecks at sea. Kirsten stood on deck detaining a child by each hand, while Lucinda consented to hold the baby till her friend should come for her. She was happier in this anticipation than her so-called mistress, who scarcely expected that Mr. Owen's banker would imagine his office extended to sending to meet her, and advising her where she should take lodgings in the meantime. Of what use could Kirsten be if she were not capable of looking out for the children and herself in such simple matters as engaging cabs, collecting and appropriating the goods which were left to them, and finding a temporary shelter ? This quiet, retiring little woman was not at all timid, distrait, or panic-stricken in such circumstances. The call for service at her hands brought her to the front with all her wits about her, as surely as the voice of duty and the bugle-call of his regiment had bidden her"], [116, "Her Gentle Deeds. 104 father fall in, be on the alert, and do all that a good soldier could accomplish in every phase of active service. Kirsten was the opposite of a helpless, as she was the opposite of a frivolous or giddy girl. She even enjoyed the bustle which did not turn her head. She was prepared with revived respect and admiration for her country's industry and enterprise apropos of the forest of shipping. She rejoiced to set eyes on old England again, though there was no familiar \u2014 not even a strange \u2014 face waiting to greet her. The friendliest woman in the world, though she did not call herself such, could not count on a friend to shake her hand at the end of her far journey. In this par ticular she was not worse off than the children, not withstanding their relations in England. She shook off the little pain with which her eyes and ears caught the many glad glances and eager salutations around her. \" Some day,\" she thought to herself, \" though it may not be a day on which the sun will shine, I shall be met like these happy people, only we shall be a thousand times happier, my. father, and mother, and I \u2014 the old perfect three ; for not merely the broad sea with all its dangers will be crossed, but every storm of life will be passed. In the mean while am I not well off to have come through fire and water, I may say, with these children unhurt, so as to make us love each other the better ? I have not allowed myself to dwell on Mr. Owen's plan lest"], [117, "A rrived \u2014 In Howard Street. 105 something should happen to prevent it \u2014 it sounded too good to be true. But I hope, I hope now it will be carried out. I do not know how I could bear to part from them \u2014 from baby (I found her last tooth yesterday), and from Beville and Katie, if their mother's brother, General James, should decide to take them away from me, or some other arrangement be made in the future. \"Look! look! Miss Stewart,\" cried Katie and Beville in one breath, as if a prince with whom they had some connection had come on board. It was Lucinda's \"true love Bill,\" in his holiday sportsman's coat and holiday sham ring, caressing Lucinda as confidently and easily as Lucinda received the caress, and then bustling away, as he said, to spot her boxes. Then Lucinda transferred the baby to Kirsten's arms with the all-sufficient explanation : \" Now that my intended has come, and since you paid my wage correct this morning, Miss Stewart, I'll be off at once. I can't keep Bill waiting : he ain't the fellow to wait, so I hope you'll get on fairly without me, and I wishes you and the young children all 'ealth and 'appiness.\" With a little common sense and common prudence, modest intelligence, good humour, and a civil tongue in her head, no young lady need really be afraid \u2014 not to say to walk alone in a London park, but even to land encumbered with children and luggage from a"], [118, "106 Her Gentle Deeds. great steamboat. There may be sharks abroad very formidable to thoughtless sailors with money in their pockets, or to poor, ignorant, foolish' young women, but the sharks are not for such as Kirsten. In Kirsten's case the somewhat unusual occurrence of the arrival of a young lady with children from a long voyage, without any male support, without so much as a servant, when it was combined with Kirsten's unpretending pleasantness, patience, and reasonable ness, appeared, to the honour of humanity, to excite nothing save good-will, and a creditable wish to spare her trouble and help her. It may either add to or detract from the merit of such conduct and its moral, according to the opinions of qualified judges, that Kirsten, if not physically beautiful, apart from her spiritual beauty, was still physically fair to see in her bright, sweet, honest, young way. More of the passengers than those on whose acquaintance she had a slight claim, to her surprise, came up to bid her a cordial good-bye. Some of them even went so far as to make offers, not at all insidious or hypocritical, but perfectly fair and sincere, of present service to her, which she declined with thanks. After just a trifle of excitement and fatigue, not disagreeable to a healthy, capable young woman, Kirsten had not only her flock, but their goods, dis posed around her in a couple of cabs. She was bound, not for an hotel, the bustle and expense of which she sought to avoid, but for a temporary lodg-"], [119, "Arrived \u2014 In Howard Street. 107 ing, the address of which had been given to her by a trustworthy elderly lady on board. The drive was long, but Katie and Beville, and, to tell the truth, Kirsten herself, so far as the baby would let her, had not time to weary of the roar of traffic and the throngs of people in the unpicturesque but suggestive streets, which were purely enlivening after the monotony of a voyage. The comparisons to Sydney were endless and bewildering till the first spark of jealous patriotism awoke in the children, as their colonial pride was wounded by the oppressive size of the rival city. \" You may say what you like, Miss Stewart, about Sydney's not being much bigger than some of the suburbs of London. You have no sunshine worth speaking of here, and no verandahs, or creepers, or Palmatta hats. The whole place is dingy and mouldy and dark, like the towns down the coal-pits I have read of.\" \" Oh, Katie, this is when it is a June day, with the blue sky and the sun certainly somewhere overhead ! What would you say of London in a November fog ? \" The lodgings were in Howard Street, Norfolk Street, off the Strand, with the din of the modern Babylon all around, and two-penny omnibuses and penny steamers within three minutes' walk. It pleased Kirsten to recall that Norfolk Street was the locality of Dickens's honest, chirruping Mrs. Lirriper. And so far as the girl could discriminate \u2014 young as"], [120, "108 Her Gentle Deeds. she was, she did not make a bad reader of faces \u2014 her landlady was honest also, while a shade care-worn and austere in the middle of her civility. Mrs. Dawes looked as if she had a struggle to live, and had herself sustained imposition in the course of her career \u2014 perhaps had lodged adventurers and adventuresses who had done their best, in the middle of their false accusations against her of making away with their cold mutton and tea, to defraud her of the rent of her rooms. She might even have quartered, without knowing it at the time, famous characters who had subsequently figured before the world as notorious criminals, lending a certain distinction, which was still the reverse of advantageous for letting purposes, to the house in which the heroes and heroines had concocted their nefarious schemes. Yet Mrs. Dawes asked no references, which Kirsten was prepared to give her, because the landlady was in her turn a reader of faces. She could not follow her vocation with ordinary intelligence without becom ing so. And one keen glance at Kirsten's whole air and address, her plain good travelling dress in excel lent taste, her quiet inoffensive manner, her sensible gentle face were more than enough for the experienced woman, without waiting for the mention of her old employer, Miss Rotheram, who had mentioned Howard Street to Kirsten, and told her that if Mrs. Dawes would accommodate the party they would find themselves comfortable ; and if Mrs. Dawes's rooms"], [121, "A rrived \u2014 In Howard Street. 109 were occupied she would tell Miss Stewart of other respectable apartments in the same convenient locality. Easily pleased and quick to make allowances, Kirsten thought, and taught the children to think, everything quite nice. The carpets and wall-papers were clean if a trifle pronounced in their pattern and colours. The chairs, sofa, and beds were whole \u2014 without broken arms, legs, or springs. The stifly starched white window curtains and antimacassars, which have sunk into middle-class lodging-house banners, were wonderfully white for town. The improvised dinner was not at all badly prepared or unpalatable, while the prospect of tea was still better ; and there was absolutely a vestige of rurality in this comparatively quiet haven of a street in the centre of dust and noise leading everywhere. On the shelf above the door of the ale-house opposite there were a gracious Virginian creeper and a humble creeping-jenny, with their long, sweeping and sway ing green and yellow starred sprays. These not only beat hollow all the stiff, staring scarlet geraniums in the window-boxes near, but faintly whispered in the ears of the little folks a murmur of more exquisite festoons. \" It is not altogether equal to the furnished houses which the wonderful Americans take, and expect to find every favourite rocking-chair and lamp in its place, with the last new music on the stand by the"], [122, "Her Gentle Deeds. 110 piano, and the last new novel and the day's news paper laid and aired on the reading tables. But on the whole I fancy I should prefer not to have my hired quarter so close a copy of ' Mine ain hame, supposing I was so happy as to have a real home. For that matter, the temporary lodging could not be like the abiding place in all that is beyond price ; the breath of the life lived there, the tokens of habits, of associations, untransferable like all the best things, the very defects and flaws which have become dear. I am curious to hear if the wonderful Americans regret that they cannot carry the quintessence of home about with them, or if \u2014 unhappy great people ! they do not miss it ? I should even prefer to choose my own paper, and still more to select my own novel. This is very good in its way, and we shall be very comfortable when we have unpacked a little, seen Mr. Barnard, and got settled down for a week or a fortnight's rest, when I can show you children some of the sights of London. Don't you think we shall, Katie and Beville ? \" \" I dare say it will do,\" said Katie, critically putting her head on one side ; \" but I should like to know a little more of it before I give an opinion.\" \" It will be awfully jolly,\" said Beville cheerfully, \" after I have got over sailing on dry land and firm ground, across the carpet, and round the table. I cannot give over sailing, Miss Stewart.\" \" Which means, my boy, that you must sail away"], [123, "Arrived \u2014 In Howard Street 111 to your bed, not your berth, give in for the night, and awake to no more sailing to-morrow.\" The next morning, Kirsten thought it better to make her first visit to Mr. Barnard without the children. She left Katie content to be in charge, and Beville too well amused with the look out from the windows, while he could vary his inspection of the world of London in Howard Street by playing with baby Sa, who took kindly to creeping about the steady floor. She had developed far more than the rest of them during the voyage, seeing that she had a great deal to do before she could be a woman. She was now for ever stretching and plunging her little legs in what were considered wild essays at the most rudimentary attempts at walking. Her goo-goo began to merge into articulate sounds, for being a girl, she was clearly eager to make her first remark. She had even acquired an individual name in the last syllable of her goodly patronymic \" Clarissa.\" She could not be expected to give or get her title in full for many a day, therefore \"Sa\" had been hit on, topped off and adapted betimes to her use, and already she \" Sa \u2014 Saed \" gratifyingly. Kirsten had been in London only once before, on the eve of her sailing for Australia. Depressed and distrait as she was, she had found time and interest for visiting the most striking attainable marvels, under the guardianship of some friends of"], [124, "Her Gentle Deeds. 112 the Stewarts of Cope Hall, who had undertaken to receive her and see her on board ship. Now, with her tone of mind and body restored, and full of new energy in the life opening up before her in connection with her children \u2014 she had begun to call them hers from the night of the burning of the Prince Arthur \u2014 she looked abroad with eyes capable of the freshest, liveliest observation, and derived instruction and entertainment from innumerable sources. Whole worlds of London were and would be, in all probability, closed books to her. There was that world of rank and fashion which was now near the height of its season, but Kirsten was not likely to know anything of it, except in occasional glimpses of the outside of its beflowered mansions. She was only an aristocrat in intelligence, a rich woman in virtue, so that she could not expect to have more than the most passing acquaintance with the great world's well-appointed equipages and their eager and languid occupants, its preux chevaliers and graceful horse-women whom she might encounter now and then when her walks took her to the West end. The somewhat fantastic world of art, with its superficial picturesqueness and frequently radical commonplaceness, its changing canons yet rigid laws, its vulgar passions under its suave exterior, was also a province beyond Kirsten's reach. Not a bit more open to her was the world of"], [125, "A rrived \u2014 In Howard Street. 113 literature, with its greatness and its littleness, its generous aspirations and its greedy money making. Kirsten knew it indeed through the books she loved. But of the living literary world, with its magnani mities and meanness, she would remain profoundly ignorant. The world of politics \u2014 of men bound, and men bitten to govern, with women fain to help, and women wild to fill the roles, of the great dames de salon of France, and to have a vain, rash, feminine finger in every ministerial pie \u2014 a world in which power and influence are either necessary burdens manfully and womanfully borne, or a Juggernaut passionately adored and openly, unblushingly worshipped, as the one worthy ambition and goal of small great men and women. This feverish sphere was as far as the steppes of Asia or the medi\u00e6val ages from Kirsten Stewart. But what did it signify, since all these worlds were but different sides and broken fragments of the great world of humanity, which continued still intact. It was in the streets, in the warerooms and shops ; in the middle class houses ; the unfashionable, unluxu rious, inelegant, not to say ungorgeous, lodgings like those of Howard Street ; in the squalid courts of St. Giles's, crammed with the poor ; among people who were plain and a little heavy in their respectability, who wore their best jewellery on a morning's outing, and dropped their h's without scruple ; among smug, t"], [126, "Her Gentle Deeds. 114 small tradesmen ; among riotous costermongers and tipsy charwomen. Kirsten, as she walked lightly along the Strand, in this the only time she was free from care in London ; and on many another day when her courageous, trustful spirit and singular unselfish ness, helped her to see far beyond her own worries and apprehensions \u2014 she found common London, the great city, which so far lays bare its life and its heart to be seen and studied by every thoughtful wayfarer, a world too large and engrossing for her opportuni ties. She might be sorrowful to heart-break, she could never be dull among the turmoil of men, any more than in the quiet of the fields."], [127, "CHAPTER IX WHAT MR. BARNARD HAD TO SAY T last Kirsten reached the bank in which Mr. Barnard was one of the principal partners. Fearless in many things, she had rather a reluctance to approach the receipt of custom appropriated to men. She felt, in her un assuming spirit, as if she must be intruding, with her small affairs, on their great business matters. She was apt to make room for new-comers, to stand aside and wait the pleasure of the most youthful of those magnates at their desks, who looked up and across at her with a stony, supercilious, or careless gaze. She annihilated herself, as it were, with a meakness which ought to have disarmed the impatience which she imagined in those servants of the banking public. But as the senior heads of departments had dens to themselves, the youthfulness of these herded together guardians of the company's funds was against Kirsten, for it could not have been her quiet, modest air and address, or her sweet humility, which rendered these young men chary of doing their duty I 2"], [128, "Her Gentle Deeds. 116 in attending to her. Possibly each was a little afraid' of the other's rallying him on his impressionability, so that they all chose to treat Kirsten exactly as they would have treated a still more plainly dressed elderly woman, incapable of flouncing in on them and hectoring over them. They affected to pay very little heed to the customer, while she stood mutely appealing to them. They rendered it doubly difficult for her to raise her voice and command their notice,. by their continuing with the greatest coolness and expertness to write neat entries in their ledgers, or by persistently pursuing their confidential talk and light chaff to each other. Let us be charitable enough to suppose that one and all of these engrossed young men would have died for Kirsten if they had known her better, still, it is to be regretted, for the honour of manhood, that even on a slight acquaintance they did not treat her with the common courtesy which would have saved her a passing discomfiture, a momentary affront. If it would have been any consolation to Kirsten to know it, she looked simply pretty, when, with a slightly indignant rise of colour, and a dark gloved little hand grasping the counter to steady her for the desperate effort, she, who had bravely faced death with her children in a burning ship, but found it a hard trial to address a room full of bank clerks,, lifted up her voice, where she stood apparently ignored, and asked if she could see Mr. Barnard."], [129, "What Mr. Barnard had to say. 117 Either the smallest of Kirsten's recommendations \u2014 her mere girlish good looks, or the faintest quiver in her voice, or some dim perception through his stupid stolidity, or perverted preference for very different attractions, of the worth of the gentle, reasonable bearing, the reflection of a gentle, reasonable soul\u2014 came home to one of the silly fellows, and he got up from his stool. Blushing in genuously \u2014 not for the offence of his dilatoriness where Kirsten was concerned, but because of the spectacle of his obligingness before his companions \u2014 he said, with a decent show of civility, he would ascertain whether Mr. Barnard was at the bank that morning, and, coming back, conducted Kirsten into the presence of his principal. Mr. Barnard, in his usefully handsome, usefully worn room, in the middle of his walls of iron safes, piles of account books, and waggon-loads of responsibilities of the most serious kind to the well-being and peace of mind of his neighbours, was far too big a man not to be gravely polite, if a little abrupt, in his manner to Kirsten. While he read Mr. Owen's letter, Kirsten took an anxious but hopeful scrutiny of the man whom she was justified in considering as the future protector and guardian of the children, and through them it might be of herself. He looked a gentleman, whether by birth and education, or by the effect of large interests well interpreted and faithfully main-"], [130, "118 Her Gentle Deeds. tained. He was tall and spare, with scant hair, and a thin, rather lined face, having drooping eyes, that yet looked up and met other eyes fairly and fully. His mouth was compressed, which might be from a firm or stern temper, or it might be only a resource acquired to hide certain sensitive curves which could not come into general play. He stood while he made her sit during the first part of his interview with Kirsten. She was impressed by him, and rather liked him. She believed she could trust him. She even fancied that, to his familiar friends, he might unbend and be genial. But as he read he startled her by first knitting his forehead and raising his eyebrows, then looking fixedly at her, and at last tossing the letter on his desk, and rapping it smartly with a pen which he had been holding. He looked at her again, keenly, earnestly. His pale face reddened, and something of the formality of his manner passed away, as if under the compul sion of considerable mental disturbance, before he addressed her hastily, \" Are you any relation of the family ? Have you any tie of blood to Mr. Charles Owen's children ? \" \" None whatever,\" answered Kirsten succinctly, alarmed at the tone of the inquirer's voice and the expression of his face. \" I went to be governess in the family just before Mrs. Owen's death. Mr. Owen asked me to take the children to England, and to make a home for them here, if possible, with your consent.\""], [131, "What Mr. Barnard had to say. 119 \" With my consent ! \" exclaimed the gentleman, employing a strong ironical emphasis, which was not intended to rebuke Kirsten. \"lam afraid this is a bad business, madam \u2014 Miss Stewart,\" reading the name from the letter, with a quick correction of his form of address, which Kirsten, with equally quick apprehension, in spite of her trepidation, took to be a friendly substitution. \" May I ask in what sense Mr. Charles Owen referred you to me ? \" \" I understood you were Mr. Owen's banker, and that you held funds of his which could be used for the children's benefit,\" Kirsten replied directly, though she trembled a little, for she saw the man was moved as at the contemplation of some great piece of duplicity and cruel wrong-doing, which had been suddenly and painfully brought under his notice. \" Then I am sorry to say there is not the slightest foundation for the application,\" he told her quietly, but decidedly. \" I am grieved to distress you, as I fear I must do ; but it is. necessary the truth should be known at once. Mr. Charles Owen had an account here, to our loss, years ago. He has none at the present date. I need not say there are no funds at his disposal.\" \" But the letter,\" gasped Kirsten, feeling as if the solid earth were giving way under her feet. \" Oh, the letter \u2014 if you will believe me, madam, it is an impudent rather than a specious proposal,"], [132, "Her Gentle Deeds. 120 coming from him to me, to furnish me with funds when he shall become possessed of them, in return for the credit which I am to give him now. It is a letter which no partner in any banking company could take into his serious consideration for a second. I return it to you for your perusal at your leisure.\" He had answered her question thus far witU some irritation and brusqueness, on account of the effrontery and folly of the appeal which had been made to him. But at this point, his eye again falling on the thunderstruck, appalled Kirsten, his tone and look softened into sincere concern, not unmingled with shame, because he himself was a man, like the offender, while the victim of a disgraceful and un natural fraud was a young, tender, to all appearance, defenceless girl. \" My poor young lady ! you will forgive my freedom of speech when I say I am very sorry for you, since I have too much reason for suspecting that a base trick has been played upon you, and you have been used as a tool by an unprincipled scoundrel \u2014 I must call him so \u2014 who wished to get rid of his most sacred obligations and thrust them on your weak shoulders, with little cause, as I should judge, for the cowardly imposition.

I believe he was to break up his establishment and resign his office in Sydney as soon as we left. I do not know where he is gone.\" Mr. Barnard made a significant gesture of wrath and disgust, and arrived at the nearest approach to an oath or a groan which a decorous, dignified, rather undemonstrative man could accomplish. \" I think,\" Kirsten hesitated, \" he was a weak as well as a reckless man. I can suppose he had some wild notion he would gain money and repay every body some day.\" \" It is of very little consequence what he thought,\" said Mr. Barnard shortly ; \" he has acted like a heartless scamp, and that is all which need be said. I cannot advise you to put any faith in such exculpa tory arguments. The man who has behaved as Mr. Charles Owen has done to his own children and to an unsuspecting woman who has not a drop of blood in common with him is a mean dog ! \" exclaimed Mr. Barnard, half under his breath, in an extremity of rancour, contempt, and loathing. \" He may be safely held guilty of the crime of child desertion in the most aggravated form.

You have neither screamed nor fainted on my hands \" \u2014 he said this with a little smile \u2014 \" at what must have been a terrible revelation to you, and I shall reward you by telling you frankly that I cannot spare more time for you this morning. But if you will give me your address, I shall en deavour, on your account and that ofthe unfortunate children, to do what I should have seen Mr. Charles Owen far enough before I had stirred a step to undertake on his behalf. I shall call and talk over with you what can be done. Good morning, Miss Stewart.\" Kirsten accepted her dismissal without another word, even with a distinct perception, in her be wildered consternation and sharp distress, that she ought to be grateful to this great busy banker and man of strict probity, for conceding so much in a case which, if his representations were correct, as she could hardly question, was one of audacious intrusion on his valuable time and weighty engage ments. She had not reached half way to the door of the room when she was called back. \"Stay, have you any money? Indeed, madam, I feel for you as a gentleman, but I have not leisure to put the inquiry in a more delicate fashion.\" Kirsten believed him implicitly, and although she had a sore sense of humiliation, as if by coming in"], [135, "What Mr. Barnard had to say. 123 contact with Mr. Owen and being mixed up with his devices, she had contracted a reversion of the results of his evil-doing, she conquered the rising mortifi cation, and simply thanked Mr. Barnard, while she assured him she was not then in need of pecuniary assistance. Then she walked through the outer room \u2014 not so much as seeing the occupants, who had a little while ago possessed the power to shake her equanimity. She looked as if she were far beyond any trifling annoyance, and caused the wise young men to whisper to each other, What mo mentous business could she have had with one of the \" governors \" ? Was she a person of importance after all, with her carriage and lackeys waiting round the corner ? For it is true that special calamity lends, for a time at least, a strange distinc tion even to the meekest sufferer. What was to become of Kirsten and the children ?

But oh, the little children ! \u2014 forward, affectionate Katie; wilful, artful, yet artless and loving Beville; helpless baby Sa. They must have, they did have, relations in England. Yes, of course there were General James and the others \u2014 the married sisters of Mrs. Owen \u2014 to whom she had only slightly alluded. But it would make a great difference for the children to be thus thrown on the charity of kindred, probably indignant and contemptuous, since there was little room left for hope that Mr. Owen had not been guilty of a dastardly subterfuge. It would be very different to what it might have been if, as Kirsten had thought, the little Owens had come to England with a sufficient provision made for their maintenance and education by their father, a man still in the early prime of life, and in the full enjoyment of his powers. Why, the common law could and would, if it had got hold of him, have compelled him to make this provision. It was hard for Kirsten, after what she had been called on to do for the children, to give them up, and leave them to a fate which, looking at it in what light you might, was not likely to be a bright lot."], [137, "What Mr. Barnard had to say. 125 Kirsten saw and heard nothing of the varied sights and sounds of the crowded streets which had so attracted and diverted her as she came along. She had been a little surprised at the time that she could so far forget her mission and the serious con sequences which depended on what sort of man she should find Mr. Barnard, and whether or not she should impress him favourably. Now, by the great alteration in her sensations, she knew how light of heart she had been an hour ago. She was suffering from a bad headache \u2014 the one ailment to which she was particularly liable, which fatigue, and especially vexation, brought upon her. But she had learnt, even in her happy youth under her father's roof, to bear the infliction in silence, pale-faced, yet with a marvellously steadfast and sweet endurance. She had only given in to the com plaint, and retired for a few hours' indispensable quiet and rest, when the torment became well-nigh intolerable. It was impossible for Kirsten to nurse her head ache to-day ; she had so much to think of and settle. Mr. Barnard was coming to see her ; the children were waiting for her.

What was papa's friend, Mr. Barnard, like ? Would he be very good to them ? When would he take them to a 'logical gardens or a circus ? Beville had been very bad twice. He had egged on baby to draw her fingers across the newly-cleaned window panes. He had played at railway trains with the chairs turned upside down, till the landlady had first sent up word to ask them to make less noise, and then had come herself and said she would tell the lady if they pulled about the furniture. When were they to have dinner, for they were half dead with hunger ? When were they to go out, for they were sick of being shut up in the house, on their first day in London, too ? Kirsten sat down, gathered up Sa \u2014 feeling foolishly comforted as the child nestled in her lap, and tried to calm down the excitement of the remainder of her tribe. She strove to put aside her headache, as she had early accustomed herself to do, permitting no trace of its presence, except in the pain endured and the strain on her nerves, which the combined pain and endurance occasioned. But her nerves, like her headaches, were under a remarkable degree of con trol. Certainly she was at this time a young, healthy woman, not broken down or worn away by ceaseless labour and care. But many young and healthy women do not attain to this conquest over their"], [139, "What Mr. Barnard had to say. 127 bodies, though they can boast of riding the most spirited horses, and even firing rifles and throwing fishing-lines, like their husbands or brothers in the pursuit of small game. The first step to be taken which occurred to Kirsten was to put Katie under as searching an ex amination as Kirsten could manage, with regard to what the child knew of her relations in England. The little girl had been much with her mother, was very observant, and had a retentive memory. In probing the mass of scrappy, one-sided informa tion which had fallen to Katie's share, Kirsten easily discovered that Mrs. Owen, in spite of her family pride, had owned a maiden surname no more dis tinguished than that of Smith. Of her two sisters, who had both married, one of them had become a Mrs. Taylor. The married name of the other was unmistakably more out of the common. It was so odd \u2014 sounding from Katie's lips like Currie-wurrie \u2014 that Kirsten felt persuaded it was either the corrup tion of a foreign word or some dimly-recalled childish pet name, not for serious use. But Katie really knew very little about her aunts, beyond the version of their names, and she was not acquainted with their localities, further than she thought Aunt Taylor lived near Portsmouth, and Aunt Currie-wurrie anywhere. The chief light which the little girl threw either on her kinswomen or on her ignorance of them, was the regrettable fact of which she was positive, that"], [140, "128 Her Gentle Deeds. poor mamma had not been on intimate terms with her sisters ; their husbands had been displeased with something papa had done. Nobody had written to mamma from England for a long time \u2014 nobody ex cept Uncle James, who had been in India, and just come home. Katie had a vivid remembrance of his letters and boxes, how pleased mamma had been when they came, and how she had brightened up to tell the children splendid marvels of the land of how dahs and elephants, punkahs and palanquins, in which the unknown generous uncle had dwelt for a number of years, though he had been at Cheltenham the last time Katie had heard her mamma speak of him. Clearly on the mother's side, the principal depend ence of the waifs was on General James, who must have been brotherly and placable where Mr. Owen's offences were concerned, who, unless he had formed nearer ties very recently, could have no more urgent claims on him than those of his dead sister's aban doned children. With regard to the father's side of the house, of which Kirsten had not heard any particulars, Katie was not a bit better informed. Indeed, she said, with a childish flippancy which would have better become Beville, that she supposed papa had never had any relations, for she had not heard a word about them. He did talk of being a boy sometimes, and of what his father and mother had said and done ; but she was sure that grandpapa and grand-"], [141, "What Mr. Barnard had to say. 129 mamma, like her other grandpapa and grandmamma, must have been dead for a hundred years. Kirsten had ten guineas of her first quarter's salary still remaining, and she had five-and-twenty pounds in Bank of England notes, not in a plausible cheque which she would now have been forced to consider a delusion and a snare. Mr. Owen had insisted on her taking the first quarter of her doubled salary in advance. \" He might have made it a thousand a year when he was about it, since it was to be a salary in Spain,\" Kirsten said to herself with a comical twist of her mouth and a little dry humour which surprised herself. \" What did my father and mother's pithy proverb say, ' It is braw dealing whangs off ither folk's leather.' As it is I am obliged to Mr. Owen for his consideration in not sending us ashore penniless.\" Before doing anything further, Kirsten must wait for Mr. Barnard's visit. She remained all the after noon in the house, till the children grew so restless, her headache so intolerable, and the chance of the banker's calling that day so slight, that she ventured out after they had taken tea. Baby, too, had been put to bed and barricaded beyond the fear of her precipitating herself head foremost from her couch, a feat she had already shown ominous symptoms of appropriating and making all her own.

Mrs. Dawes, with her portentously solemn and almost threatening exterior, vindicated Miss Rother ham's recommendation. She knew a good young creature and a lady when she saw her, and although Mrs. Dawes was a little perplexed and disappointed by nobody's having either inquired or called for her second floor front lodger, the landlady refrained from betraying her surprise and disappointment to Kirsten. Mrs. Dawes looked on all children with dubious eyes as more or less the plagues of grown-up people's lives ; but she had a soft spot in her heart for babies and little boys. She would put herself about in many ways before evil should befall a human atom under her roof. And she began even in these early days to have a slight relenting of her severe code to the very person who needed it most. \" Little Master\" was a horror in one sense, but he was a bonnie boy and a torturing charm in another. She had no children ; she was not married. She had only assumed the matron's prefix to her name according to an old custom, which, without any idea of forfeiting truth, survives among landladies. Everybody who cared about Mrs. Dawes, or whom Mrs. Dawes needed to care about, including her"], [143, "What Mr. Barnard had to say. 131 landlord, knew that she was a flat-bodied, hard featured, goggle-eyed, iron-grey, single woman, or single female as she preferred to be called, wearing very light, curiously choice calico gowns in the morning, and dark stuff gowns \u2014 whatever was the season of the year \u2014 in the afternoon. She had been a good servant, cook, and housekeeper, rising in the ranks of service and not multiplying her situations for many years, She had taken her house and furnished it and proceeded to let lodgings, partly as an investment of her savings and a more inde pendent mode of earning money and providing for her future, partly that she might take home an aged mother and sick sister, and nurse them in turn, tiU they were laid in the earth, and she had paid all the expenses of their decently respectable funerals. Mrs. Dawes had not had time in the course of her diligent life for making acquaintances, \"keeping company,\" and entering the state of matrimony, while the absence of personal attractions on her part, and the awe-inspiring solemnity that had arisen from the strength of the desire to fulfil every binding obligation in a conscientious but not sanguine or buoyant nature, had prevented any man from being bold enough to force his way through all entrenchments and take the fort by assault. Thus, some honest man or some ne'er-do-well, as it might have happened, had missed a first prize in marriage. Mrs. Dawes did not mind the lack of the support k 2"], [144, "Her Gentle Deeds. 132 which she had never known ; but there was one thing which she sometimes confessed to herself in the silence and darkness of the night, or the com parative repose and meditativeness of a Sunday evening. \" I should not have cared so much to be any man's wife,\" she reflected in the strict privacy of her own thoughts ; \" but I would have liked to know what it was to be a mother.\" She had always felt her calm, worthy heart stirred by babies. But now as Beville's merry blue eyes met hers half defiantly, half coaxingly, she experienced a strange doubt whether a wild little master with all his masterful ways, roving mischief, endless pranks, and restless fulness of life, might not have proved a greater, if more dangerous boon, than the best of babies, to a staid elderly woman. Kirsten took out the children in the golden summer gloaming. She let them have a look at the shops in the Strand, at the old church of St. Clement-the- Dane, which rings its sweet, peaceful hymn-tune in the half-deafened, half-distracted ears of the business world every work-a-day evening ; at grim Temple Bar, standing waiting for its removal, with never a traitor's head to lend tragic significance to its ginger-bread substitute. She found her way to the Thames Embankment. In spite of his late long experience of a ship, Beville was enchanted with the steamers and barges, while Katie rejoiced in a pleasure-ground, which, in spite of the wayfaring"], [145, "What Mr. Barnard had to say. 133 men and women she encountered, the child took to be an elegant promenade for ladies and gentlemen. The air soothed Kirsten's spirits and did some thing to abate the headache. What was she that she should murmur and fret at this world's tribulation, when she thought of all the hapless freights the noble river had borne on its bosom \u2014 prisoners to the Tower in the old days of government and laws as savage as lawlessness itself; passengers to outward bound ships, either hopeful as she had been when she sailed to her kind aunt, Mrs. Latham, or hopeless from the anguish of leaving not graves of the dead, but homes of the living, with all most cared for on earth behind them ; disfigured empty tabernacles of clay, which had once held the immortal spirits, that in the desperation of weakness, the torture of purposeless remorse, or in godless isolation, had launched themselves into eternity. Oh ! the Thames was not a mere pleasure river for thoughtless pleasure-seekers, not an ordinary highway of traffic, it was a grand stream of life or death flowing through out the centuries, just as those who gazed on it took it. It glided and swept at last from sweet rural fountains to the heaving, tossing salt sea, which might be only the German Ocean to those to whom the primrose by the river's brim is the yellow primrose and nothing besides ; but to other hearts and brains the wide waste of waters is still more a figure of the shoreless sea of eternity."], [146, "Her Gentle Deeds. 134 \" Another day we may take the train a little way and get as far as Cleopatra's Needle, on which Moses must have looked, which Jacob, even Abraham may have seen. Think of that ! \" cried Kirsten excitedly. \" And there were trials for the giants in those days, as for the pigmies in these. Even Moses and Abraham, though they were prophets and patriarchs, had their hard fight and affliction.\" \" And did their wives sew so long ago ? \" inquired Beville, with an astounding shock of descent into anti-climax. \" And how has such a wee, wee thing as a needle been kept so long ? Is it in a case like Katie's ? Why, Miss Stewart, we may not find even the case among all those ships and houses.\" \" Oh ! Beville, you are such an ignorant little goose,\" cried Katie in exasperating scorn of his inferiority in knowledge and sense. \" Cleopatra's Needle isn't a common needle, it is a single stone like a steeple. Bev, you are fun.\" Beville, though he had a sweet temper, pouted at having made fun unawares. Kirsten had to comfort him by telling him the story of the blunders which the managers of an aquarium company committed, in the anticipation of the gift of an alligator, to be presented personally by a popular naturalist. They sent a van to the station to meet him and his imposing companion ; but the van returned empty, for the gentleman produced the alligator during the dinner given in his honour. He drew the animal"], [147, "What Mr. Barnard had to say. 135 forth composedly from no more roomy a receptacle - than the cigar-case which he carried in his breast pocket. This apparently cheery little woman, chattering with the chattering children, had found the \" lifts \" fall on her within the last twelve hours. She knew herself the victim of a shameful imposition, while Katie and Beville, not to say baby Sa, were worse off still. They had the taint and stain of bad blood and exceptional wrong-doing from the unscrupulous father who had cast them adrift. The explanation was not only that we, all of us, have, if we take the trouble to count and compare, as many lives as a cat with as happy a tendency to fall from the most dizzy height with a convulsive scramble on our feet ; it was that she had infinitely deeper, wider, more lasting knowledge, which enabled her to digest what was superficial and temporary. In spite of all agnosticism, positivism, and Comtism, she held stoutly by the faith as it was delivered to the saints, the faith of our Arian ancestors in a Father who will never forsake His children. She clung like the Apostle Paul to the Cross of Christ, which told her she must have fellowship with Him in His sufferings, and that all the time her life and the lives of the unconscious children were safely hidden with Him in God."], [148, "CHAPTER X. INQUIRIES jfij p&iHE next morning brought to Kirsten a con- K fiHH' firmat'on' which was scarcely needed, of jagJagf Mr. Barnard's version of affairs. There was an Australian letter from Mrs. Addington to Kirsten ; to her shame it reached her through Mr. Barnard's bank. The contents of the letter may be summed up in a few of the writer's sentences. \"Oh ! my dear girl, I am afraid you have been as rash in leaving Australia as you were in coming to it. I hope it will be a lesson to you in future to be a little more careful in taking any decisive step. Mr. Addington has heard from authentic sources \u2014 of course, he would not like his name to be mentioned \u2014 that Mr. Owen has been deep in debt, and has been engaged in gambling and mining trans actions, besides being far too fond of company, for a long, long time. He would not have been suffered to continue in his office, and he has simply bolted without making any further announcement or taking leave of anybody. He ran away by one of the night trains, and nobody knows where he has gone. There"], [149, "Inquiries. 137 is a great hue and cry, because he has left loads of debts behind him. Poor Mrs. Owen is well out of the way, as women always are in such cases. She did give herself airs about being a Government official's wife, I suppose ; but if she had lived her pride would have had a fall. I hope you got up your salary. Of course you will rid yourself of the children as soon as possible. Even if the relations are not willing to take the girl and boy and the baby off your hands, you know these people must, for no law can force you to keep the children. I trust you will soon find another situation, and be much more fortunate in it. At least, you are in the dear old country, of which I often tell my boys and girls ; sometimes I hope to show it to them, when we shall renew our acquaintance,\" &c. Kirsten could no longer be shocked, or even surprised, all that was over ; but the last gleam of hope that there might be some mistake vanished with this letter. To Mrs. Dawes' severe satisfaction Mr. Barnard not only called before going to the bank, he drove into Howard Street in his carriage, which, with its well-appointed horses, coachman and groom, stood waiting for half-an-hour at her door. Mrs. Dawes was not an innately worldly woman, but she was not above being moved by the pomp and circumstance of wealth, and still more affected by the impression they would have on the minds of her neighbours."], [150, "138 Her Gentle Deeds. In the same manner, though she was an innately honest woman, she yielded, not without a pang, to some of the time-out-of-mind malpractices of her sisterhood, while of others she made a difference, re sisting them stoutly. She was not an angel in the shape of a lodging-house keeper, she was a sinful woman like her sisters ; but it is not a necessary consequence that her sins were more heinous because they were, in what may be classed as a commercial line, distinct from the tracks followed by a select portion of her fellow-creatures. The children were in the room into which Mr. Barnard was shown. Katie at once took the initiative, smiled all over, and advanced readily with out stretched hand. She had no shyness, and she claimed the visit as paid to her and Beville ; she only looked behind her to knit her brows at the reluctant Beville, who hung back and took on a sulky air as if he recognised his double disqualification for meeting Mr. Barnard on equal and amicable terms. Beville felt both that he was a minor, and that his habit was to abide in a chronic condition of naughtiness. Mr. Barnard was incapable of deliberately morti fying a child \u2014 on the other hand, he was not a child's man. He would have experienced a diffi culty, in any circumstances, of doing more than shaking Katie's hand and hoping she was no worse for the voyage, and asking Beville if he had been to school ? if he had caught any whales coming to England ?"], [151, "Inquiries r 139 while the questioner would probably have inserted a tip into the child's palm. As it was he did not omit the tip, though he said no more than, \" Good morning, children,\" and immediately added, \" Had they not better be sent to play elsewhere, or go out for a walk, Miss Stewart ? \" . Retiring to their bedroom in disgust, Katie re marked bitterly to Beville, \" That this speech showed Mr. Barnard's extreme ignorance, as if they cared to play when their affairs were being discussed ! as if they were ever allowed to walk without Miss Stewart, when nurse was not there. She, Katie, did not like papa's friend at all,\" an opinion from which Beville craved leave to dissent, hopping round the room with his tip, and shouting at the highest pitch ofhis voice, a singularly inappropriate quotation from one of his father's songs \u2014 \u25a0 \" For he's a jolly good fellow.\" Mr. Barnard's first idea was very much that of Kirsten. The whereabouts and position of the next of kin, after their father, to the little Owens, must if possible be traced out without loss of time. He him self had known nothing of Mr. Owen's connections, and little of himself, save that he had once possessed a post in a Government office in the country. The late Mrs. Owen's family name of Smith was rather a vague clue. But \" General James and Currie wurrie,\" if the last had any existence, save on a child's tongue, afforded considerably more promise. Mr."], [152, "Her Gentle Deeds. 140 Barnard would at once set inquiries on foot, but he did not hesitate to advise Kirsten strenuously to look out for herself. \" My dear young lady, you have been badly treated,\" he said. \" Perhaps I used strong language the other day \" ; he went on with the shade of annoyance and self-conscious taking himself to task of a cautious, reticent business man who felt he had been betrayed into unwonted heat, and thence into unbusiness-like language. \" But there is one proposition which no body can deny. Some other guardian must be found for the children till the uncle and aunts turn up.\" Involuntarily Kirsten looked wistfully at him, when he winced ever so slightly and turned away. \" I feel that the children's mother as well as their father made me their guardian, and that I must stay with them till nearer friends, who can do more for them, are found,\" she said, with a sigh for the little home in common, which was now a shattered castle in the air. Mr. Barnard offered fresh tokens of being put out. He walked to one of the windows, came back with a faint colour in his pale, keen face, and said \u2014 \" Miss Stewart, I hope you will allow no senti mental nonsense to mislead you.

I speak to you as a father, or any other friend to whom your interests would naturally and rightly come first, might address you.

I will engage that these children do not so perish, even if we are unsuccessful in discovering their relations in this country.\" Mr. Barnard paused, while Kirsten waited for what was still to come. \" I may confess to you that after what has happened I have serious apprehensions \u2014 though I shall do my best to bring about a contrary result \u2014 that these Smiths and others, supposing they are not myths like Mr. Charles Owen's banking account, will slip through our fingers. Still, even in that extremity, the children will be taken care of \u2014 the institutions of the country will provide for that. But for you to stick to them, or to let them stick to you, is simply to tie a mill-stone round your neck which will sink the whole set of you, and not do a bit of good to any one.\" The speaker paused again, and once more he re sumed. \" What can a girl like you do to provide for three children \u2014 one of them a baby ?

At the best it is altogether doubtful whether the Smiths, or whoever they may be, will retain your services and afford you the amount of recompense to which I have no doubt you are entitled, for remain ing with the young Owens as their governess. By far the most prudent step for you, and I am bound to consider you in the matter, is to give up your charge immediately. Parting will be only the more painful the longer you defer it. You ought to go directly to your friends, or wherever you may be in the most suitable position for getting another situation.\" Kirsten was confounded by Mr. Barnard's urgency for her withdrawal from the scene. She could not comprehend it then or for some time to come. He clearly desired, as the first obligation, to free her from all further responsibility by separating her from the children. Yet he did not look like a ghoul who was prepared to devour the unfortunate victims. She had liked him and felt she could put confidence in him in spite of the distance between them, in the course of their first interview. She liked him still and had the same inclination to trust him, but she could not understand him.

But neither had Mr. Barnard possessed the most remote acquaintance with Captain Stewart. Clever as Kirsten was, and she was a woman of rare intelligence, she could not put herself in a man's place in this catastrophe. Sheer goodness even dis torted the focus of her mind in the matter where she herself was concerned. She did not fully realise what advantage had been taken of her woman's weakness, and of the generosity and tenderness of which \u2014 God be praised \u2014 so much womanly weakness is made up. She could not be expected to feel how any man, with a man's heart in him, must resent the outrage and strive as the first duty to remove the reproach from himself at least. Mr. Barnard was pre-eminently an honourable man. He was -not of the calibre of men who can be generous \u2014 if generous is the proper term \u2014 without being just. Justice came first with him, it was the breath of his nostrils. He had a passion for justice such as a few men and women entertain ; and Mr. Owen's performance was on all sides so revolting to Mr. Barnard's moral constitution, that if he had been a self-indulgent instead of a reasonably humane man, he might have desired for his own comfort to wash his hands of the whole wretched business, to have done with it and forget it as soon as possible. Being what he was, he could not do that altogether ; but he tried his best to rescue Kirsten instantly from her"], [156, "Her Gentle Deeds. 144 painful position, and to save her from further injury by it. He got her to promise that she would con sider his suggestion, because she felt it might prove unwise in her on the children's account to offend him. He had said, and she saw the truth of it, that these children who had been intruded on him had no claim on a man with a multitude of binding obliga tions ; nevertheless, in the young Owens' forlornness this \" no claim \" actually constituted a species of claim on such benevolence as belonged to him, since except for herself in her powerlessness he was all they had for a friend. Mr. Barnard had somehow put into Kirsten's head the notion that she might become a burden to the Owens in the eyes of their relatives, instead of the Owens being a burden to her as he had contemplated the situation. But Kirsten in her candour, while thanking him for his concern on her account, provoked him by adding, \" You were so good as to say you would speak to me as my father might have done. I am not so sure that he would have advised me to leave the children \u2014 at least, not till their destination was settled. He was an old soldier and he held strongly by a man's remaining at his post till he was re lieved.\" \" But I have relieved you \u2014 so far, Miss Stewart \u2014 and you are not a man,\" protested Mr. Barnard, taking his leave."], [157, "Inquiries. 145 That evening Kirsten had sent to her the ad dress of several trustworthy governesses' homes and agencies, together with copies of the Times, Daily News, and Standard. The last favour was repeated every morning, as if it were the result of a liberal order to a bookseller. However, Kirsten did not avail herself of the ad vertisements, she could not quit the children till she knew what was to become of them. Mr. Barnard might be an excellent man of business \u2014 a wise man, a good man even, but he could not tell a woman's heart \u2014 and the heart of Kirsten, like the hand of Douglas, was her own. She could do as she liked with her own. She would go at a word the moment it was proved to her that she was not wanted, and that the children would be better without her \u2014 till then she would stay where she was. This young woman, so prudent in most respects, was capable of a pathetic recklessness when the interests of those dear to her came into rivalry with her own, and it was merely her private fortune which might kick the beam. If she lived much longer with these children, things must reach this pass, that she would not care what became of herself honestly, so that all was right with the little Owens. She had the true de voted mother's heart in her breast, while she herself was still but a young maid who might have had 3. proud and happy mother of her own.

The tidings were not only scanty, they were grievously unsatisfactory. A General James Smith, who had seen service in India, and been residing at Cheltenham about the date loosely given, had died suddenly in a railway carriage, on a journey to London three or four months before. If he had been the General James referred to, he had not survived his sister by a longer interval than a few weeks, and was doubtless un acquainted with the fact of her death. Doctors' Commons had been visited, but no will had been found. A retired officer, a bachelor, who lived up to his income, might have small occasion to make a will. A London directory several years back gave the address of a family named Courier- Warreau, then domiciled at Upper Norwood. But the name dis appeared from the directory the following year, and nothing was now known of its owners at their former address. The Courier- Warreaus who, according to Katie, had once lived anywhere, seemed to end by living nowhere."], [159, "Inquiries. 147 There were more than one family named Taylor in connection with the dockyard, Portsmouth, but hot one offered indications that pointed to the missing relatives of the Owens. Mr. Barnard recommended advertising, and for warded a paragraph he had drawn up subject to Kirsten Stewart's approval. Although he had strongly recommended Kirsten's giving up the children to him, he had not assumed the responsi bility which she had not resigned. Kirsten was edified by the advertisement, which struck her as a model of wariness. She approved of it chiefly because it did not publicly compromise the poor unconscious children. \" The family of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Owen, late of Sydney, Australia, are now in London.

It might have escaped the notice of those interested in it, or it might be viewed by them as a ruse to entrap them into an acknowledgment of ties of kindred bristling with trouble and expense, and calling upon men and women, already sufficiently burdened with families of their own, to adopt another family that ought to have been otherwise provided for.

But I cannot argue upon the soundest treatment of such examples in the mass, I can only deal with this individual example according to my conscience.\" She did not like to say anything about a special providence to Mr. Barnard. He seemed a man whose theories were so square, and his creed so dogmatic, that he would not admit of interference with them, even in the shape of a special providence. Besides, it sounded arrogant and presuming for her to hint at a special providence that had anything to do with so insignificant a person as she was. Yet to her the age of miracles was not past. She looked out on the world with eyes fresh, because of the heart's perennial freshness. Her eyes saw farther than other people's eyes because of her spiritual insight. And she was so troubled and humbled by the perception of what old divines used to term a \"call\" to accept the gift which other people scouted, that she was tempted to add, in the vague manner she felt forced to assume when she talked of this notion to Mr. Barnard, \" This seems an instance of the body without the head, and the head without the body, so that there is a certain fitness in this coming together.\" An absurd idea stopped Kirsten from winding up the sentence with the natural end, as was said of the Cateline conspiracy, \" He will think that speech so pedantic and unreal \u2014 just like a governess"], [165, "Mr. Barnard's Ultimatum. 153 and an affected woman airing her thin, scrappy knowledge\u2014 the classical part from Lempriere's dictionary.\" Mr. Barnard scarcely heard her. He was troubled by another consideration, which never occurred to her. The great banker was disturbed by the wonder, what the friendless, Quixotic governess would think of him and his conduct. He burned under his out ward reserve to justify himself in her estimation. \"You hold* me a hard man, no doubt,\" he said, half-coldly, half-earnestly ; \"but you do not know the difficulties of the rich, who are not often really rich, but oppressed by heavier burdens than those under which the poor think themselves crushed. You cannot possibly fathom the anxieties and respon sibilities involved in failing to balance aright rival interests and conflicting claims. Charity which looks generous is often cruel. Apart from that, the wealthy class in the numbers who have sought at least to employ the power inherited or won to the best of their belief, is surely entitled to its own aspirations and ambitions.\" He said what was strictly true, what she was pre pared to acknowledge, but all the time he was pon dering on something which had not entered her head.

He knew all which this enthusiastic, unworldly girl could not guess, that he, like ninety-nine of the so-called rich men, in London, was living so near the verge of his large income that he had compara tively little to spare. He had aspirations perfectly lawful, but decidedly expensive, both for himself and his family : the parliamentary career which was yet to open for him, the still more assured and far greater success which the cleverest of his sons might make in the House, the positively illustrious \u2014 a tall word was wanted \u2014 marriage which the fairest of his daughters, with a proportionate dowry secured to her, ought to command. He was aware that he would require all, and more than all, his funds to do as he desired in times when commerce was in a disastrous instead of a prosperous condition, and trade and enterprise were shrunk, shaken, corrupted, and undermined. It did not follow that they had not an immense, perhaps inexhaustible, rallying power, and would not come right, and the country be as flourishing as ever eventually. But Mr. Bar-"], [167, "Mr. Barnard's Ultimatum. 155 nard was too good a student in such statistics not to know that eventuality like eternity is a long word, and might tarry in its most certain performances. These were also times, the parallel of which might have been drawn again and again in the history of the world. With regard to them, the march of costly luxury and extravagant display was about commen surate with the progress of social distress from many causes. This luxury and display, while generally sneered at, still counted for so much in the eyes of the world, that the weakly, hypocritical sneerers were the first to practise the follies against which the men and women railed. He, for one, was mostly pinched, after a large interpretation of the word, in his re sources. He had to restrain his expenses where it could be done without an unmistakable injury to others, and without attracting invidious attention. He possessed the usual number of poor relations whom he felt bound to relieve, whom he did relieve methodically and punctually, so that he was a bene factor to many, while some who were not distinctly of his own flesh and blood blessed him. It might not have been a serious strain to add to them a girl like Kirsten, who would have been quick to help her self. But to take up a family of small children, whose sole recommendation to him was the cool, mendacious trespass of their father, would be the utmost stretch of absurd recklessness."], [168, "156 Her Gentle Deeds. It has been said before that Mr. Barnard could not be generous without being just, but he was not the one man in ten thousand in this generation who could so rule his spirit and restrain his inclinations as to have it within his reach to be both just and generous. Another fact with which Mr. Barnard was ac quainted, and which rather pressed upon his mind at this moment, was that his wife and daughters would like nothing better than to hear what their world would regard as so pretty a story \u2014 the story of Kirsten Stewart and her little pupils. The ladies would make a nine days' wonder of it though it was the height of the season. They would take her up and bring her forward and get their lady friends, dear Lady This and dear Mrs. That, to be interested in \" the charming little romance,\" to have a concert and private theatricals \u2014 the affair could hardly assume the dimensions of a fancy fair \u2014 on Kirsten and her children's behalf. Mrs. and the Misses Barnard, while the furor lasted, would call almost every day in Howard Street and have Kirsten and her proteges \u2014 a word that would wound her \u2014 at the house in the square or out to Whitethorne. They would smother her with flowers, fruit, game, worked sachets, hoods, and handkerchiefs, with other equal, unsuitable, inadequate, graceful gifts, till the end of the season carried the family off to the Ardennes or Norway, or till some other more novel and engros-"], [169, "Mr. Barnard's Ultimatum. 157 sing object of interesting, exciting benevolence crossed their path. Mr. Barnard, while unable to pre vent the process, had witnessed it too often, with its amiable hallucinations in the members of his family, and its delusive hopes and bitter disappointments in the sanguine-minded victims, not to decree that it should not be gone through, with his will, where Kirsten was concerned. But what Mr. Barnard did not know was, that Kirsten, \u2014 who looked so quiet and sensible in her vagaries that she might have got the credit of comprehending some of the mountain-load of troubles, which renders it easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven \u2014 had not after her first interview reckoned on Mr. Barnard's inviting the children to his house or houses. And Kirsten would have withdrawn half-shyly, half-proudly, from the patronage of the ladies of Mr. Barnard's family for herself. She was not a woman who put undue weight on the attributes of the Bar nards' position, their retinue of servants, carriages, silk attire, French cookery, and opera boxes. Actually she would not have cared for them, as an individual, she would rather have recoiled as from things to which she had not been accustomed, among which she and her ways would have been out of place, just as Lady Burleigh shrank from the grandeur which had unwittingly become hers."], [170, "Her Gentle Deeds. 158 Kirsten Stewart was a better-born, better- educated woman than Sarah Huggins, Lady Bur- leigh ; Kirsten would hardly have had to grow a noble lady, and it is improbable that she would have died of the honours and obligations of any rank short of that of a queen. But she had the mingled moderation and fine perception which are found sometimes both among men and women, with the perception generally most developed in the woman. She saw the unsuitability of usages to which we are not accustomed, and the lack of harmony between us and the habits strange to us. Possibly in her modesty and humility she exaggerated the dis- crepancy without any tendency to slavish sub- serviency, or the slightest taint of malice and envy. She had inherited from her father and mother the old Scotch weakness for a long pedigree and a stately bearing. This partiality belonged largely to the gently born and bred, but it was not entirely absent in the most rustic quarters, just as a true respect for learning might be found flourishing in the most ignorant Scotch hind. Kirsten had an innocent interest in, and admiration for, all that was really aristocratic, magnificent, and exquisite. She had an idealised, half-poetic regard for the old nobility and gentry ; let us say, a regard as wide as the poles from the common gape and stare, the fretful or fierce jealousy, the coarse craving for what is unattainable by the looker-on."], [171, "Mr. Barnard's Ultimatum. i5g But Kirsten would a great deal rather be interested and admire from a distance, which was quite as well in more lights than one, since in many instances a nearer acquaintance would have rudely dispelled the charm. All the same, Kirsten could not give in. She would not consent to part from Katie, Beville, and Sa, not even after she had been told that it was much better the arrangements which had to be made for the children should begin as they must end, that the younger the children were \u2014 and the eldest was still but a child \u2014 the less they would feel the terrible reverse in their fortunes, that there was not, and ought not, to be another place for the children of such a man as Charles Owen than the workhouse. It might sound a severe sentence, yet it was a righteous decision. Setting aside the iniquities of the father, Mr. Bar nard granted that there were orphan asylums which would be more suitable than the workhouse for children reared as these had been hitherto ; but apart from the consideration that these asylums ought to be kept for the children of the innocently unfortunate and the deserving poor, any interest which he had in such institutions was bespoken over and over again. In days like those we live in, such places were positively besieged by applicants, till the mere management of the votes of the supporters of the charities had become a plausible, elaborate"], [172, "160 Her Gentle Deeds. system, threatening to degenerate into a dishonest trade. It was such an affair of time and labour to work up the machinery till a child could be admitted into such an institution, that there was some danger of the infant becoming an adult before the feat was accomplished. There were the emigration schemes for children, Mr. Barnard farther stated, but these, which might be thought of later, dealt with no higher class than filled the workhouse, while at least one of the Owen children was too young for the experiment. Kirsten, though much tried, still resisted. She was young, gentle, naturally yielding, so that it was a great effort and pain for her to stand up and oppose Mr. Barnard. But though he was able to stagger, he could not overcome her. He dashed down any little hope she had entertained. He frightened her, for she was too sensitive a woman not to be appre hensive in the middle of her faith. He forced her to admit in much trouble that she might be doing wrong. She might, as he said, be simply prolonging the torture ofthe unhappy children by protracting their downfall and deferring its inevitable end. But she must try and fight the battle single-handed. She must make a stand in the rout before she consented to a complete and final defeat. If it came to the worst, as no civilised people will permit children to starve, they could but go to the workhouse \u2014 after all, the only difference would be"], [173, "Mr. Barnard's Ultimatum. 161 that she would, perhaps, need to go to the workhouse with them, when she had spent all her strength upon them in vain. But better that than for her to attempt to live on with any pretence at peace, in the comforts she had been used to, and let Katie, Beville, and her \u2014 Kirsten's \u2014 baby, that had been hers for months, go away by themselves, while she could help it, to face the bed and board, uniform, and company of paupers. The children had passed into her hands from the relaxed grasp and stiffened fingers of their dead mother. Their father, such as he was, had intrusted them to Kirsten's care. She had been faithful to her trust when she and her children stood between fire and water, a horrible death on either side. She would not be cowed now by the prospect of beggary and the clutch of starvation. If the little Owens must be condemned to what the respectable poor regarded justly as the lowest degrada tion short of the brand of crime, Kirsten would much rather suffer with her children, if the guardians would but permit her entrance in any capacity save that of a burden on ratepayers. She might save young hearts from breaking, and keep alive in them the remembrance of better things and the hope of better days. Kirsten told Mr. Barnard her resolution, and succeeded in irritating and offending him. He was not accustomed to be contradicted, so that persistent opposition in the teeth of common sense, to what he u"], [174, "162 Her Gentle Deeds. had brought himself to look upon as an undesirable conclusion, struck him in the light that Kirsten her self was a little inclined to view it as a piece of presumption. The girl was hardly more than twenty, little older than his youngest daughter. He had hoped better things from Miss Stewart, but she was proving herself as wrong-headed and contumacious as the silliest, most self-engrossed of her sex. In addition to this, every token of her quiet, steadfast, almost unconscious self-immolation stabbed all that was higher in the man's nature with acute self reproach. \" Then I shall leave you to act for yourself with regard to these children, Miss Stewart,\" he said at last, with gathering hauteur and anger, \" since you do not see the propriety of following my advice.\" Mr. Barnard's last tone strengthened instead of demolishing Kirsten. She rose to the occasion, and took farewell of him without either consternation or bitterness. There was a unique dignity in her re covery of composure, and freedom, not to say from virulence, but even from exaltation of spirit. \" You could do nothing else,\" she said sedately and sin cerely. \" I am very sorry for the trouble which the children have given you. I am ashamed of it. But you understand \"\u2014she put it in wistful parenthesis \u2014 \"that we did not know, and you will excuse our ignorance. We are much obliged for the assistance you have rendered to us, especially in trying to find"], [175, "Mr. Barnard's Ultimatum. 163 out Mr. and Mrs. Owen's relations. The little we have learned we could not have discovered for our selves without a great waste of time and means.\" Absurd as the idea was, it sounded as if she were actually trying to console him for his inability to help her and the children \u2014 to atone to him for her being compelled to thwart and vex him ; and it was not done in an ostentatious, heaping-coals-of-fire-on-the head fashion, but in perfect simplicity, in a spirit of magnanimity and merciful forbearance and considera tion which was marvellously large-minded and large hearted in so young and slightly-armed a creature. When he was gone she told herself, \" If I am all the friend the children have left to them \u2014 if I have perhaps deprived them of Mr. Barnard's small amount of countenance, supposing it could have reached them in a workhouse, I must do all the more for them.\" Then she solaced herself as before in royal womanly style. She went and snatched up Sa from her domain of the floor, before Katie and Beville could be upon her. Kirsten hugged the astonished child, \" My baby, my Sa-Sa shall not go to a workhouse nursery, to be grudged every spoonful ol bread-and-milk by reluctant ratepayers \u2014 not if I can work day and night to hinder it. She is my baby. God has given her to me, and oh ! I hope He will let me keep her if it but be for her good, and if I struggle very hard.

Kattens knows all about it.\" \" No, Beville, Miss Stewart is to come to me when I have a house of my own. She is too old already to ride a hobby-horse, and she will not want a pearl necklace like mamma's though I shall want it when I am grown up and go back to Sydney.\" \u2014 \" Spoken like her mother,\" thought Kirsten.\u2014 \" But I must save one of the strings for baby Sa and another for your wife. Miss Stewart is to teach my children and my children's children.\" \" Then, my dear, I must be very busy to keep up with the times,\" asserted Kirsten. \" Never mind your children just now, Katie,'' interposed Beville. \" I say, Miss Stewart, when will Mr. Barnard come again to give me another half-crown ? \" \" My dear boy, you should not be so fond of money,\" remonstrated Kirsten. \" My father used to say Scotch boys were not regularly tipped like English boys \u2014 not in his day.\" \" Then I am sorry for your father, Miss Stewart,\" said Beville, jauntily but sincerely, sliding off the arm of the couch."], [177, "Mr. Barnard's Ultimatum. 165 \" Not at all, Beville ; he was far better off. I think it makes boys mean and greedy to be always looking out for such spoil. Scotch boys were treated more like men, and were too independent and high-spirited to care for such indulgences so as to count upon them. You may admire a grown-up man, and be pleased to have him for your friend to notice you and be kind to you, but I am sure the friendship would be more honourable and satis factory without a constant accompaniment of tips.\" \" I don't know,\" objected Beville ; \" if a man is as dry and not more amusing than Mr. Barnard, how can a fellow be expected to care about him unless for a tip ? \" \" You are candour itself, Beville, but you have not had a great experience of Mr. Barnard, and you are not likely to have more.

COMING DOWN IN THE WORLD. IRSTEN'S cudgelling her brains day and night brought forth no very brilliant ideas. She had to bear her own burden \u2014 not hers alone, but that of the children \u2014 with all her gracious fund of deference and obedience, the absence of which is often the grand fundamental defect in modern young women, since it offers the best indication that they will become in time and in their turn wise, good rulers, she was forced to act on her own responsibility for herself and the children. It was her nature to look up and cling to another for guidance. Sensible as she was, she had the gentle fault to excess. She would have let others choose for her even on points of importance, and would have followed their dictates, however disagreeable, if her conscience had approved of them, with perfect loyalty. But she was not permitted. Instead, she had to submit to a sharp cure of a sweet modest propensity which might have degenerated into im perious weakness. She was compelled to serve as a support, in room of being supported."], [180, "168 Her Gentle Deeds. She was as friendless as she had represented herself to Mr. Barnard. She could not write to Haythorpe. It would look like soliciting charity, and she must find her own resources fail before she trespassed on those of her neighbours. She was not ashamed of anything she had done, yet she shrank from announcing her circumstances and exciting the mingled wonder and compassion of her old friends and associates. As for Mr. Stewart of Cope Hall, who had been left her guardian in the matter of the little fortune which had so soon taken wings to itself and flown away, he was almost as much out of the question as Mr. Barnard. A duke's chamberlain who answered in any degree to the onerous post, to be bothered by the trifling affairs of a girl like her and of strange children like the Owens ! It was an incongruity not to be thought of. In addition, though his guardian ship of Kirsten had been entirely in relation to her bank shares, he would be sure to write to her in answer to her letter and bid her give up the little Owens, when she must flatly disobey him, as she had disobeyed Mr. Barnard. She was like the man in the Bible, \"of age,\" and therefore called upon to answer for herself. It seemed best for her to stay on in London, though the summer heat made it trying for the children, and Kirsten dreaded the expense. But if anything were yet to come of Mr. Barnard's enquiries"], [181, "Coming down in the World. 169 for the Owens' relations, London was the most likely place for them to turn up in, and the quarter where tidings would most readily reach her. There she would most speedily be found if Mr. Owen chose to make use again, more pardonably, of Mr. Barnard's banking-house in order to communicate with her. To quit London appeared like resigning the last clue on the Owens' account, and Kirsten could not con sider herself justified in doing so. Besides, London, the centre of English life and enterprise, ought to be the best place for getting work of some kind, and if work were not to be had, of procuring help \u2014 even workhouse help. Kirsten must seek daily teaching, or try to serve in some other capacity, and make her earnings maintain a family. She had already entered the rank of governesses without any sense of degradation. As to serving in a shop, she was also quite convinced, without reading \" Mary Marston,\" that she could contract no real degradation ; on the contrary, she should win real honour by doing what she was called to do faithfully, intelligently, and heartily. This is not to say Kirsten had none of an old fashioned gentlewoman's foolish prejudices, handed down to her by her worthy mother, of what the old Stewarts on both sides of the house would have thought to see her standing behind a counter and waiting upon the whims and caprices as well as the honest wants of customers. Her father had cared"], [182, "Her Gentle Deeds. 170 less for such distinctions, yet he, too, might not have regarded an \"ell-wand\" wielded publicly as a fit successor to his sword. Apart from this consideration, Kirsten's retiring nature recoiled from the little exposure, while she systematically undervalued her abilities in this as in every other respect. She lay awake half the night, tormenting herself, as if she had not enough cares besides to worry her, now about advanced arithmetic, now about some weak point in what ought to be preternaturally correct syntax, now with regard to the time it took her to trim a bonnet, and again about the difference between amateur work and accepted standards in millinery and dress-making. Kirsten had a nervous horror of her own awkward ness and blunders, of the withering condemnation of scholastic censors, of encountering the Argus eyes and sharp tongues of foremen and forewomen and fellow-workers. Meek and mild as she was, she would dislike exceedingly, rude liberties and coarse familiarities from those spirits that might be moved to such approaches. But when the question came to her whether Kirsten would abandon the little Owens to their fate, or teach in the most difficult circumstances, or serve in the commonest respectable shop, or descend to charing or washing for the day, there is no need to ask Kirsten's answer. Of course she knew that, in any light, she could"], [183, "Coming down in the World. 171 not hope to make enough money to maintain the children, even in the simple way in which they were then living. They must all descend a good many steps in the social scale. Kirsten, in the midst of her anxieties, had a comical sense of those fortunate and admirable gifts which are apt to distinguish heroines of fiction in her position. They are almost all amateur artists or authors of such striking promise that after a few trying snubs and rejections, which end by becoming the most wonderful points of all in the young ladies' remarkable career \u2014 for it is passing strange such transcendent merit as theirs ever escaped recognition \u2014 the candidates succeed in securing a more or less fair income from picture-dealers or publishers. To be sure, these lucky aspirants have generally only themselves or an aged parent to support. They are not, as a rule, crippled by a family of strange children, the youngest not a year old. Is there a subtle connection between artistic talent and female virtue in distress ? It did not hold good in this instance, and Kirsten would not have recommended any girl situated like herself to trust to it \u2014 not even though that girl had been ten times as well endowed. Neither would Kirsten have advised her sister in misfortune to pin her faith to the amiable, unworldly, childless couples, who appear the moment they are wanted, and beg to be allowed to take the heroine to their warm, honest hearts, in which they foster her,"], [184, "Her Gentle Deeds. 172 till, with her fine faculties, and her corps of lovers in the background, she is more than mistress .of the situation. In Kirsten's case there was a quadruple call, as everybody must acknowledge, for the benevo lent couple, and they ought to have^been provided with an ample nursery \u2014 emerging from which Beville might be looked for swinging himself down the banisters, 'lurking behind doors, springing out and startling the old gentleman into fits. Katie would certainly be seen skipping downstairs, and proceed ing to lecture and patronise the old lady. As for Sa, if she had the baby-grace to stay where she was, she would not be prevented from making night hideous with her shrieks, until she banished sleep from the eyes of the devoted pair every time the child cut a tooth. Withal, there would be no hope of a speedy deliverance for the victims of their own generosity, because, strange to say, Kirsten could not draw or write \u2014 professionally. She had not even that acces sory \u2014 at once useful and ornamental \u2014 of a lover. She did not possess her mother's cultivated talent for music ; while the French, which her father had imparted to her with such pains and pride, could be beaten hollow any day by the native Frenchmen and women as plentiful as blackberries in London. No, though Kirsten's price was far above rubies, there is no denying that her acquirements, in the present state of the world, were not very marketable. But one good thing which belonged to Kirsten"], [185, "Coming down in the World. 173 Stewart \u2014 like hope at the bottom of Pandora's box \u2014 was an almost inextinguishable faith in her kind, especially in those whom'she trusted with reason as well as from instinct.

I, for one, would not become a pensioner on his bounty, and the children are not to him what they are to me \u2014 a man with a number of children and friends of his own, and a multitude of claims upon him, I don't doubt ; indeed, he said as much ; a man who has a great business to manage, who is one of the partners in a large banking-house, with the credit and peace of mind of thousands in his keeping. Why, he is nearly as responsible as a member of the Government deciding the fate of nations. He is not to be troubled by every poor family thrown upon him without excuse by their father. He is right that there would be no end to such barefaced applications if they were once granted. He could not hand us over to his clerks. We are"], [186, "Her Gentle Deeds. 174 not in his line. He did all that could be looked for from him.\" There was also Mrs. Dawes, who had done justice to Miss Rotherham's \" word \" in her favour. Mrs. Dawes had minded her business as a landlady. She had given Kirsten and her children their due for the money they paid. She had scorned to falsify or fabricate an item of an account, though she had charged extra for the kitchen-fire and the castors, over and above her bargain. She had borne with Katie, taken to Beville, and nursed Sa. Kirsten argued soundly from these precedents that Mrs. Dawes must be a good woman, worthy of trust, and likely to give wise advice. And such a frank confi dence, founded on such sensible premises, to the honour of what virtue is left in human nature, is rarely misplaced. Kirsten made a clean breast of it so far to Mrs. Dawes \u2014 only so far, because she could not with the tender delicacy towards the children and the strict reserve where her own gentle deeds were concerned, which was extremely characteristic of the speaker, bring herself to tell what was the connection be tween her and the Owens. She did not explain how they had been left destitute, or why they had fallen to her charge. She stated briefly that she had been disappointed in a provision which she had been led to anticipate for the children, and Mr. Barnard, the gentleman who had called, could do nothing for them."], [187, "Coming down in the World. 175 She had only a little money, which she had brought with her ; she must at once begin to work for more. She was about to seek employment as a governess, or she would go into a shop or show-room, but there were difficulties in both cases. Kirsten was not one of those who make difficulties either for herself or others, but she had a capacity for foreseeing trouble in her own path, which while it had a slightly melancholy tendency, was not entirely disadvantageous. It saved her neighbours confusion of face and pain in laying drawbacks before her, and it spared herself many a disappoint ment as she looked the lion fairly in the face, which was a yet wiser plan than \" hipping ower it \" (hopping over it), according to the dauntless advice of an old Scotch matron. Kirsten was* not carried away by her imagination, so as to run the risk of becoming panic-stricken the moment her elation had died out. The trouble she foresaw at present was as follows. Though she had been in a situation as governess and had given the utmost satisfaction, she had received no recommendation from her late employer, unless, indeed, what might have been the convincing one of the children on her hands. She had only her own word to offer, and she was re luctant to speak the word for the result of the engagement. With regard to a post in a respectable house of business, she feared that an apprenticeship and training, perhaps a recommendation, here also"], [188, "176 Her Gentle Deeds. were necessary, in all save exceptional cases, before wages could be hoped for. Kirsten could not propose to retain her present rooms, but she trusted Mrs. Dawes might be able to tell her of some cheap \u2014 very cheap lodging ; she would not mind how poorly furnished the apartments were, if they could but be respectable, clean, and in a healthy neighbourhood, for the sake of the children. Would Mrs. Dawes think it too great a favour to grant if Kirsten were to ask her \u2014 from what she had seen of her lodger and from her reference to Miss Rotherham \u2014 to give the petitioner an introduction to the landlady of these other lodgings which were under discussion, sup posing Mrs. Dawes knew, in her superior experience, of such a person and place. It would be of the utmost consequence to the children to find another motherly woman to mind them in what Kirsten was fain to expect would soon be her daily absence from home. Mrs. Dawes was probably in the habit of listening to more or less astonishing revelations from her lodgers, to judge by the immobility \u2014 not at all uncivil or even unfriendly, only rather stony \u2014 with which she heard Kirsten's slightly agitated tale, and craved leave to take it to unprofessional aviz andum, to turn it over in her own mind before she delivered an opinion. The caution would have utterly chilled a more impulsive, less reasonable"], [189, "Coming down in the World. 177 woman, but Kirsten had a patient comprehension of Mrs. Dawes' solemn, slow, sterling nature, and her con fidence was not more than damped for the moment. Sure enough Mrs. Dawes, the instant she was free from the clamorous demands of the first-floor lodger, retired to the breakfast -room, which was her own kingdom, sat down, put on her spectacles, as if she were about to read, though it was not the hour for her paper, and folded her hands over each other, instead of over a book. \" God help 'em, poor things,\" she was saying to herself; \" so they've got to fight the world all by themselves \u2014 the considerate, pleasant-spoken miss, and them children \u2014 the bonnie boy, never out of mischief, and the baby as wants a woman's whole time to see to her little wants and mind her proper, bless her soul !

The least little 'itch would do it \u2014 if I only 'ad my ticket up for three weeks running and nobody so much as to look over the apartments, or the second-floor back, doing as 'as been done before, taking French leave, with nothing left behind but a hempty valise, torn play books, pipes, and gin and polly bottles. But for all that I couldn't 'ave the face to go to church of a hafternoon and hevening, when lodging-letting is slack, like a Christian woman, or read a lesson with one eye shut in the busy season, if I didn't do what I could for the horphans \u2014 or worse.\" Accordingly, Mrs. Dawes met Kirsten with a cere moniously polite proposal ; the good woman grew the more polite, the more she became the obliging instead of the obliged person. If Kirsten liked, she and the children could continue to occupy the rooms they had, at a reduced rate, subject to their being let any day, when another lodger offered the proper price for them. Unfortunately, where Mrs. Dawes was concerned, this event was not likely to occur soon, as in the"], [191, "Coming down in the World. 179 heat of summer Howard Street, Norfolk Street, Strand, did not form a locality liable to be besieged by would-be lodgers, indeed, it was not greatly troubled by visitors under any pretence. The ex ceptional frequenters of the baked pavement were the ubiquitous organ-grinders, an occasional peram bulator, with its peevish freight and weary driver, or an itinerant trunk-seller, ostentatiously, and some what tauntingly, holding up a trunk open and \" hempty,\" as that of Mrs. Dawes' impecunious second-floor back lodger. The token was flourished in front of the various windows, as if to reproach the inmates who yet lingered in the background, unable to refresh their bodies and minds by flights to the marine breezes and gaieties of Margate or Ramsgate. However, in contemplation of the boon of an unexpected lodger, Mrs. Dawes undertook to remove the present representatives of the second-floor front to a more elevated, airier region, with yet lower rent ; and if that exalted quarter should be coveted in its turn, she promised to transfer the family to an underground Paradise, provided Miss Stewart did not object to sharing the breakfast parlour with Mrs. Dawes on the occasions, few and far between, when the two kitchens were abandoned to Emily Anne. \"Because, miss,\" explained Mrs. Dawes, fascinat ing and fixing Kirsten with the landlady's prominent eyes that were ordinarily straightforward, but which now twinkled a little, and even gave a faint indication N 2"], [192, "Her Gentle Deeds. 180 of executing an expressive wink ; \" if so be you were to go to one of them low localities, after cheap lodgings, you'd 'ave a deal less chance of being hired as a governess.

Hany way, you're under a decent middle-class roof, that is always something, and if the swell lady or gentleman coming to spy, takes the name of the tenant out of the directory, and makes hinquiries at the nearest butcher or baker, or at the post-office, I'll go bail they've nothing to say against me, further than that as I always pay my way, then in course I can't give the slap-dash horders that are the way with some folks, as are all for credit and two-yearly settlements.\" \" Mrs. Dawes, I can't thank you enough,\" exclaimed Kirsten gratefully ; \" you've lifted a load from my mind.\" But when Mrs. Dawes had made up her mind, or was delivering a speech, she did not like to be inter rupted, even with thanks, so that she motioned Kirsten to be silent, till she, Mrs. Dawes, had finished all she had got to say. \" Me and Hemily Anne do not eat the bread of idleness, not that Hemily Anne is as active, by a long chalk, as I should like her to be, but gals will be gals, and thin legs ain't made of cast iron, any"], [193, "Coming down in the World. 181 more than holder and richer people's, though the first floor seems to think so.

Me and Hemily Anne 'ave set it down to good breeding and plain clothes as fits a lady, against bad breeding and fine flash clothes, though I wouldn't hopen my mouth against a lodger that pays regular, though she do make herself troublesome, nobody could deny that. There are some lodgers as are troublesome by nature, likewise the reverse. You are the reverse, miss, you'll do what you can to spare others to your last gasp, if I may make so free as to tell you.\" Kirsten murmured her thanks for this testimonial, and Mrs. Dawes continued ; \" Me and Hemily Anne \u2014 which she was not engaged to wait on children \u2014 know you will not trouble us more than you can 'elp. We've got used to the pretty little things, short as your time 'as been. For I did 'ave a couple four years and an 'alf; and there is a friend of mine as kep' her two pair back thirteen years. Think of the luck! To be sure he was a run down hofficer, with a bad leg, and a hawful temper, and it was a trial to wait upon him at the last.

Me and Hemily Anne will give a look over and above every nows and thens to the children when you are hout of the way.\" It was far more than Kirsten could have hoped for, a friendly hand held out to her by one of the much-abused London landladies, who, if they are hard and grasping sometimes, if they pilfer extensively on occasions, if they lend themselves on exceptional cases to grievous evil, have, in the main, hearts in their bosoms much like other women. There was no further cause for hesitation. Kir sten was about to commence her campaign, to begin that looking for something or anything to do, with all the will to work, which in the mere search is often so exhausting and dispiriting as to sound like a bitter mockery of our advanced civilisation and Christian humanity. The fact is that employers and employed have drifted far apart. Hosts of pretenders have come in between and choked up all the channels of communication. It is becoming every day harder and more overwhelming for the wanter in either case so much as to attempt to find the person wanted in the surging throng of competitors, a large proportion of them incapable ; though it may be that all the time the two who would have come together, with so much mutual benefit, are dwelling unknown to each other in adjoining streets."], [195, "CHAPTER XIII. THE PESTILENCE THAT WALKETH IN DARKNESS. HE very morning when Kirsten was about to start to measure the capabilities of one of Mr. Barnard's agencies, Mrs. Dawes stopped the girl on the stairs and begged a private interview with her. There was such a portentious increase of her wonted solemnity in the worthy land lady that Kirsten's heart, well tutored as it was becoming to shocks, threatened to stand still under the apprehension that something had gone dread fully wrong. Beville had shot paper pellets and made faces at the first floor, and she had given notice to quit. All the lodgers had struck, and announced their immediate departure unless the second floor front and her children were put out of the house incontinently. Emily Anne had commit ted some unheard of enormity, or Mrs. Dawes herself had heard shocking news. \" Miss,\" said Mrs. Dawes, when she had ushered Kirsten into the unoccupied breakfast room, and closed the door warily, \" I must warn you that"], [196, "184 Her Gentle Deeds. scarlatina is in the street, some of the family at number nine 'as been took. Indeed, not to alarm you, miss, the undertaker 'as been there this morning, for the children 'ave been down with the fever for a week and more, though them that ought to 'ave known better tried to keep it secret. They are that sly and deceitful at number nine, they never even hopened a winder. But they're in trouble now, and their different rooms are leaving 'em bag and bag gage, in cabs as fast as 'osses can go, sowing the fever all over London among hinnocent landladies that 'ave their bread to earn ; not that it is with other parts of London or other people we've to do fust, it is with ourselves and this ere 'ouse. It goes to my 'eart that Miss Katie and Master Beville have been given the key of this street for the last two days, and that only yesterday I saw the boy in the harear of number nine, after his ball.\" Kirsten was silent for a moment with a tightening of her throat and a whitening of her lips. It showed how much she was distressed and alarmed that she instinctively took refuge in a little jesting impatience the better to mask her feelings, as well as to quiet Mrs. Dawes' gloomy fears. \" Oh ! Mrs. Dawes, scarlatina will not come through stone walls, and if it is not like the plague, neither is it a very uncommon complaint that it should fill people with dismay \u2014 most families are well enough acquainted with it. Most children have"], [197, "The Pestilence that walketh in Darkness. 185 scarlatina as they have measles and whooping cough, and get better of it, as a rule, quite as easily.\" Then Kirsten changed her tone before Mrs. Dawes, who was strictly literal in her interpretations, had got time to arrive at the conclusion that she had been entirely mistaken in Miss Stewart, who was one of the hardenedest and most heartless young ladies that ever was born. \" Mrs. Dawes,\" Kirsten asked anxiously, \" do you think we should go away immediately ? we shall find a^place some where, no doubt.\" Mrs. Dawes answered, still more than half mystified, and, speaking with a considerable amount of huffiness, grafted on her natural stiffness and solemnity, \"As you please, miss. If the hinfection is about it's like you'll carry it with you, or find it before you ; but as you please.\" \" No,\" denied Kirsten quickly, \" it's not as I, but as you please. You have every right to direct our movements. What I meant was, do you think the children are a special source of risk to your house \u2014 a kind of fever conductors that above all others are in clanger of bringingthe evil across the threshold. I think I can guess the trouble that would follow, and I must not expose you of all people to it, if I can prevent it.\" \"Miss, fever in a lodging-house is nearly as bad as fever in a school, it is next door to ruin,\" said Mrs. Dawes, with the tears coming into her eye. \" It is not only the commotion and the disorder and the"], [198, "186 Her Gentle Deeds. waste, what with nurses and fumigation, it is the bad name afterwards. But for all that I 'ope I ain't the woman as would drive little children that may be sickening already with the disease, and a young lady as is what a young lady should be, hoff on a suddent to strange quarters among worse hailments or among thieves and vagabonds. I couldn't rest quiet on my dying bed and breathe my last breath in peace if I did. I'll tell you what, miss, we'll make a bargain, and I know who is as safe as myself not to break it. We'll keep in the children and watch 'em, and at the fust sign hoff he or she goes to the fever hospital with nobody the wiser. It is the best place for 'em, take my word for it, miss, and it may save no hend of distress.\" Kirsten could only agree, praying devoutly that the step might not be called for, and that no harm might come near the children or Mrs. Dawes, who was imper illing her household and her livelihood for their sakes. Afterwards, Kirsten walked upstairs again, slowly drawing off her gloves. The information which she had just received put an end to her quest for the present. However low her little stock of money, which formed the common purse for her and the Owens, might run, she could not go to agencies, rub shoulders with other governesses, enter houses having a clean bill of health where little children were running about in safety which nobody ques tioned. For all the time she might have the germs of scarlet fever, which, pretend what she might, was"], [199, "The Pestilence that walketh in Darkness. 187 the most treacherous and disastrous malady children have to face, hanging about her skirts or sticking to her gloves, as it used to be said that small-pox was carried about in the hoods of the woollen cloaks worn by vagrant women. The children could not be told of the enemy in the neighbourhood, even on the plausible pretext of putting them on their guard. She was too well acquainted with the strength of Katie's imagination and the extent of her histrionic powers. No maladie imaginaire of the great French dramatist, no cunning malingerer in a gaol would beat her at posing as an invalid, with the grace of the self-deceived mislead ing the most cautious. If Katie were suffered to pursue this course she would be whisked off to a fever hospital, with or without a choice, in a trice. Besides, Kirsten had a correct notion that, excellent, humane woman as Mrs. Dawes was, she would, if not prevented, relieve her mind by such dismal tales of small victims to the malady, smitten and slain without a moment's pause, that if depression of juvenile spirits could pave the road to an attack, the children were on a safe way to it. Their keeper felt pledged never to have her eyes off the children, but, with Mrs. Dawes' consent, Kirsten improved on the original programme. In stead of confining the Owens, shut up within stone walls, to the infected street, she hired a perambulator for Sa, and pushed it without the slightest sense"], [200, "188 Her Gentle Deeds. of humiliation. The serious necessities and heavy troubles of life were rapidly robbing the old captain's daughter of such conventional scruples as she had ever possessed. Kirsten conducted her whole troop abroad under her wing, keeping them as constantly as the weather would permit in the open air \u2014 fresh even in London beneath the summer sky, which, in spite of the blurring smoke, was fitter for her purpose than the most \u00e6sthetically painted roof. Kirsten expended a few pence on omnibus and train fares in order to make excursions with the elder children to the parks and sit under green trees watching the grand com pany, with the cream of which poor little Katie was always prone to identify herself, \" Why don't we hire a carriage and drive too, Miss Stewart ? We shall \u2014 shan't we, when we hear from papa ? For I don't think I should care now to go with Mrs. Barnard. You know, mamma always said we were not to go with everybody.\" \" I don't want to drive like a girl,\" answered Beville, \" unless I had the ribbons and the whip ; even then it would be no fun here on this level road. I want a horse or a boat. Oh ! do come, Miss Stewart, and let us have a look at the little boats on the Round Pond,\" a spectacle which, far more than the soaring, glittering Albert Memorial, was the coveted goal of Beville's expeditions in one direction. Thus Kirsten made a slightly forlorn pretence of"], [201, "The Pestilence that walketh in Darkness. i8g taking a holiday, while she and the children im proved their quarantine by acquiring a pleasant acquaintance with haunts which were not all stone and lime, full of the dust and clatter of traffic. On the contrary, there were green oases fit to dwell in the memory with the most rural scenes \u2014 spots fair, sweet, and sometimes quaint with old memories, quiet enough, or merely astir with the voices of women and little children. There were the alcoves as old as Queen Anne's time. There were the glades among the great elms \u2014 some of the trees brought over from Rotterdam in compliment to Dutch William, in the boughs of which blackbirds and thrushes sang in their season in spite of the perpetual grinding of that great mill of London which did its work on hearts and brains, serving as a continual bass to the bird's treble. There were the winding paths among rhododendrons and thorns by the water. There was the Flowery Walk, where elderly people strolled for the chance of a sight of some of the common garden flowers of their youth. There was the Broad Walk, where the yew hedges stood where Caroline of Brunswick's maids of honour \u2014 Molly Lepel, Mary Bellenden, and the rest \u2014 had flitted among the mazes, tracked by Lord Fanny and the son of MacCullummore. And there was the old red palace where William's brave Mary, sickening of small-pox, had spent a dreary winter's night burning"], [202, "Her Gentle Deeds. 190 her letters and private papers in anticipation of the sad end. In the same palace another and happier heir to the throne was born, so that on another dewy May morning an innocent, true-hearted young princess drove forth to be proclaimed where the ancient crosses had stood, before shouting multitudes, to come back an earnest-minded, noble-spirited queen. The holiday came to an end abruptly, not at all as Kirsten and Mrs. Dawes had dreaded, but still less as they had hoped. The girl came down early one morning in her walking-dress and sought a private interview with the mistress of the house. The am bassadress looked shaken \u2014 now red, now pale, as the bearer of evil tidings. She made a singularly bold request for so modest a person. \" Mrs. Dawes, will you leave whatever you are doing and come with me immediately to the nearest doctor ?\" \"Lord! which of the children is took?\" cried Mrs. Dawes, throwing up her only disengaged hand, for she was carrying a coffeepot with the other. \" None, please God ! \" answered Kirsten in a tremulous, husky voice, \" but I am ill myself. My throat is so sore I can hardly speak. I have been very sick. I have not slept all night. Luckily, the children are still asleep, and I have left them so. I do not wish to see them again till I am sure I shall do them no harm. If it is fever I have taken I need not come back.

Poor Kirsten, with her flying pulses, smarting throat, and swimming head, faintly comprehended this. But she did keep up her heart, so far as not to waver in her resolution, though certain fantastically tragic visions seized the opportunity of coursing through her excited brain, during the few steps she had to stumble to the arbiter of her fate. Had she set her house in order, like good Queen Mary, when she felt the small-pox was on her at Kensington Palace, two hundred years or so before ? Was Mrs. Dawes surreptitiously crying as she helped her \u2014 Kirsten \u2014 along ? Did the pair bear a highly figura tive resemblance to Charles and Mary Lamb, when the unhappy attached brother and sister walked in tears, arm in arm, Charles with a straight-waistcoat in his pocket, to leave Mary at the nearest madhouse? Fortunately the heaven-sent doctor was at home, he had not gone out after a hard night's work. Like most medical men of his age in London, who are eager in their profession, he was in the habit of hold ing morning levees of patients\u2014 a source of great heart-stirring to his landlady. At these hours he was wont to figure as an amateur doctor, so far as fees were concerned. Thus he was accustomed to be in terviewed betimes, and to have his breakfast deferred and interfered with without his taking the interrup tions in ill part, since he was as yet rejoicing in a"], [205, "The Pestilence that walketh in Darkness. ig3 good conscience, a light heart, an easy temper, an appe tite difficult to rout, and a super-excellent digestion. The doctor was whistling like a lark, and calling \"all right\" in a sanguine spirit from his bedroom in reply to the summons, when Mrs. Dawes and Kirsten entered, and he was at his whistling again in five minutes afterwards. Within that brief space he had sat upon and disposed of Kirsten, while she had no more than a feverish conception of what her father would have called \" a yellow-haired laddie,\" whose strange accents sounded \" kindly,\" and smote her with a sense of familiarity that nearly sent her off, in her abnormal state, into a fit of crying which would have been very unlike Kirsten Stewart, merely be cause the man happened to be a Scotchman. The doctor, in a perfectly natural manner which inspired confidence, with its fine mixture of matter-of factness, intelligence, and interest, felt Kirsten's pulse, looked down her throat, put a few questions and received answers, then pronounced her doom, so far as her destination was concerned. The fever had been so eccentric as to keep off the nestlings and strike her who was in the place of the mother bird. It was a clear case of smart scarlatina. He would write an order for the hospital at once if she wished it. Her friend had better call a cab \u2014 to be disinfected presently \u2014 and take her there in the first stage, when there was little or no risk from exposure. Of course the hospital was the proper place ; fever o"], [206, "Her Gentle Deeds. 194 in a lodging-house \u2014 well, sets of furnished apart ments came to much the same thing \u2014 was the very mischief, not to be thought of for an instant, unless the good ladies proposed to propagate the complaint for the benefit of the doctors. This doctor was busy, the affair was an every-day matter to him, and according to his age and tempera ment he dealt with it lightly. He treated the case professionally, and he treated Kirsten professionally. If he looked at her with any other eye than that of a medicine man, so as to have a superficial impression that she was a nice-looking girl, he judged her by the circumstances and the company in which he saw her. So he addressed both Kirsten and Mrs. Dawes in the same voice within a few minutes of his intro duction to them as \" good ladies,\" and spoke of Kirsten's necessary resort to the hospital \u2014 not un feelingly, certainly, but with a trifle of jocoseness. It is apt to be a young man's fault when he has to do with women who are at the same time older than himself \u2014 he was looking at Mrs. Dawes and thinking of her when he spoke \u2014 and of women who are in a lower grade than his own, though not sufficiently low to compel respect by their abject misery, as other people claim it by their splendid prosperity. It was especially the fault of the young man at this stage ofhis development, partly from natural thought less gaiety of disposition, partly from hatred of betray ing the deeper feeling which lay beneath the gaiety."], [207, "The Pestilence that walketh in Darkness. ig5 While the doctor wrote out the order of admit tance to the hospital to which he was attached, Kirsten consulted hurriedly with Mrs. Dawes. Kir sten had all that was left of her little stock of money, about twenty pounds, ready to hand over to her friend. \" I know it is a great deal to ask of you, Mrs. Dawes,\" she said hurriedly, \" but will you spend it for the children, and do what you can for them? I need not ask you to be good to them, poor little things, you have been so good to us already. It is hard to put all this trouble upon you when you have so much to do, but the Lord will reward you, as the beggars say in the streets \u2014 still there is meaning in the words sometimes, I am sure. When the money is gone, here is Mr. Barnard's card ; call upon him and he will tell you what to do. He proposed it from the first, and I have just staved it off, but I cannot explain now. If I die \u2014 you will hear of my death, won't you ? \u2014 go to him in the same way.\" Sensible and experienced woman as Mrs. Dawes was, she lifted up her voice and wept, with the de monstrativeness, on sufficient provocation, which as a rule rises in proportion to our descent in the social scale. \" Come, come,\" called the young doctor, over his shoulder from the table at which he was writing. \" We are to have no more of this \u2014 no piping or play ing of waterworks, if you please.

That was a sell, I take it. And the fever was not simple scar latina but complicated typhoid, yet you see I'm none the worse of it to-day. Here, take this and you'll get on famously. I'll see you when your doctor makes his rounds in your ward.\" Kirsten was not quite capable of receiving all the consolation which the words were meant to convey, but she remained true to herself in seeking to persuade Mrs. Dawes, in her own interest and that of her household, to come no farther with the patient who was about to put herself of her own free will into the common refuge of the sick poor. The worthy woman was obdurate. She would see the last of \"Miss\" \u2014 she used the somewhat ominous phrase \u2014 and she would call or send Hemily Anne to call every day at the doctor's to hear how it went with the patient. Mrs. Dawes did not care, at this supreme moment, though she were found out, denounced as a landlady and her apartments left desolate. She was satisfied in her own mind that the fever was not so \"catching,\" and infection did not fly upon people doing their duty like that, though \" Miss \" had not escaped, else how did doctors live in the midst of disease ?

As for the children, well, \" Miss \" might rely on her. Kirsten could rely on Mrs. Dawes. It was the one crumb of comfort of which, as her solitary precious morsel, she was fain to make much, when she found herself sick and alone in the suffering crowd, lying on one of the beds in the long lines of beds within the high whitewashed walls of a great city hospital. It might be, and it was, highly beneficent in its general aim and action, but it was necessarily almost as homeless an atmosphere \u2014 where the individual patient, new to its scientific precision, was in question \u2014 as a prison could have produced. Sometimes, when Kirsten was slightly delirious, she fancied herself reduced to the workhouse, to which she had been tempted to seek admission in the train of the Owens. She would call piteously for the children, asking in a humbled and forlorn tone what good it could do for her to be there when she was separated from Katie and Beville and the baby. Even when Kirsten had all her wits about her, she was sufficiently weak to experience the dreariness of being one in a multitude of sick. She was waited upon, indeed, with humanity and charity in alliance with trained skill, and the command of means for her relief and restoration, or for the decent disposal of all that was left of her should she succumb to her"], [210, "198 Her Gentle Deeds. malady. But she was without a single special heart throb for her welfare, without an eye to watch her privately and particularly out of a world of watchful ness which was all her own, without a voice devoted to soothing and cheering her, which should uncon sciously sing a Te Deum every time her symptoms were favourable, and Miserere when they were ominous. Kirsten told herself, whenever she was able to reason, that she was very silly and egotistical, that she ought to be thankful to have so much done for her \u2014 while she was constantly trying to save her nurse and doctor in efforts which sometimes defeated their end. In what respect was she better than those other patients to right and left, alongside and opposite her ? though when it came to that they had visitors on visitors' days. It was only the most loving heart in the wide building, which was again, by a strange fatality that was yet God's will, famishing for a grain of kindred affection or house hold tenderness. Kirsten had been a healthy child and girl. Any illness she had known \u2014 apart from the occasional terrible headaches which she was accustomed to call \" nothing,\" which, indeed, did not seem to affect her general health \u2014 had been mostly childish complaints, such as mumps or measles. She had enjoyed the benefit of a doctor, but any instrumentality which he employed had been trifling compared to her"], [211, "The Pestilence that walketh in Darkness, igg mother's endless cares and ample pharmacop\u0153ia of her own, of old-fashioned housemother's cures and cossetting dishes. Very likely the first were not often of much value, or the last always judicious. But Kirsten could not help thinking of them fondly now and missing them endlessly \u2014 just as she missed her father's hushed voice and footstep, his wonderful offerings to his little girl, with his triumph when she was able to sit up in bed and allowed to play a game of dcminoes with him. What would that father and mother have thought if they could have foreseen their cherished child in this sickness, a unit unnoticed except as a doctor's subject, an object of charity in a mixed multitude ? What did they think now if they were permitted to look dowrn on her in the hospital bed ? Ah ! there was .10 frown on their brows, and their eyes though they were moist were shining. In the light of these looks of commiserating love and approval, and of another majestic tender look which seemed to pierce fer through and through, while it said, \" Inasmuch as ye did it unto the least of these My brethren, ye did it unto Me,\" Kirsten found strength to bear her loneliness and to rest in the shadow of the wings of the Almighty."], [212, "CHAPTER XIV. AN HOSPITAL CONFIDENCE. iT is necessary to admit that Kirsten did not make a good patient. It might have been otherwise in different circumstmces. though there would always have been the dravback that one who had been all her life singularly un accustomed to thinking of herself, would have been liable to continue oblivious of many incidents ivhich merely concerned her own welfare. She would have been apt to put no weight on sensations and con ditions which were hers and not another's. What did it signify whether she had been hot or cold, thirsty or nauseated ?

All that had to do with herself dwindled into mole hills in Kirsten's estimation, just as their individual affairs are wont to loom into mountains in many people's minds. The inveterate habit actually inter fered with the working of Kirsten's common sense on her own account. She was always in danger of being careless of herself and of her special concerns. In a happier frame of mind the good and the evil of this propensity might have balanced themselves. She would have gone entirely out of herself the moment she began to recover. She would even have been able to avail herself of her large powers of observation and extensive sympathies in the ward of an hospital. She would have remarked a hundred instructive, interesting, or sheerly diverting traits of the hospital routine and regime, and of the patients, nurses and doctors, which would have escaped the scrutiny of ninety-nine ordinary persons. She would have been provided with the best of tonics in this occupation and amusement, even when she could take no active part in the life, with its inexpansible human details. Kirsten would have listened with relish to the story of the elderly sempstress in the bed next her, and would have been almost as excited as the heroine to find whether or not her young (?) man had been to enquire for her. For the mature working woman"], [214, "Her Gentle Deeds. 202 was not to be deterred from thoughts of marriage, and dreams of disinterested devotion, by the fact that her young man was an unlucky fellow, of a sickly habit, and frequently out of work. Kirsten would have lain and pondered over the couple's humble, hapless fortune, and puzzled what she could do to brighten them. She would have felt a breathless interest in the girl of twelve whom this neighbour of hers compared to the Ruler's little daughter. The child had been very ill, even to the ominous screen being placed round her little bed. Kirsten had not shivered and moaned for herself like the elderly sempstress at the sight. Kirsten had clasped her hands and murmured prayers for another ; she had opened her closed eyes rejoicing when the screen was removed, because the crisis was past. The nurse who had gone in to deal with death came out to tell that life was the portion of the feeble struggler in the terrible encounter. But the gazer's interest would have intensified ten fold had her mind only been disengaged and lightened of its burden and care. Kirsten would have gone so far as to have com mented in her own mind on the shape of the nurses' caps, and the cut of the doctors' coats, and the style in which this woman waddled and that man fired his words like shot from a gun. But all ease and peace of mind for such profitable studies, and the deductions to be drawn from them, were denied to Kirsten because"], [215, "A . . Hospital Confidence. 203 of her load of anxiety. She might have been a wife and mother and the mistress of a house, many times repeated this girl of three-and-twenty, with far less strain on her faculties, from the waggon weight of obligations she had piled voluntarily on her slim shoulders. And, to the honour of woman, she was one out of many girls who constitute themselves burden-bearers betimes. How were the children ? Were Beville's never resting feet lying still ? Was Sa tossing on her baby pillow? Had the Owens' been carried to some other hospital \u2014 some children's hospital ? Was the money exhausted ? Had the children been sent to the workhouse, where Katie, if she did not break her heart in the meantime, sickening as much from a wounded spirit as from changed diet and surroundings, would grow soured and sullen among the proverbially sullen pauper maid-servants, and even Beville would become morose \u2014 a hulking hanger-on at livery stables. Then this infatuated young woman told herself that the little Owens' mother, who had not been particularly kind to Kirsten, would say to her from another world the cutting sentence, \" Miss Stewart, you have failed lamentably in the trust I put in you\" ; and their father, who had foisted on a simple girl the duties and restraints which ought to have been all his own, if he ever returned to England, would forget his geniality to reproach her bitterly with having suffered his children to sink so low. \" You know"], [216, "Her Gentle Deeds 204 the station to which they were born, the comfort in which they were reared so far ; you had their dead mother's commission to look after them. I thought you could have managed somehow, and you have been able to do nothing better for my son and daughters than to let them be reduced to this wretched pass, branded with the degrading stamp of the workhouse which they will never shake off to the day of their death. Why, even though I were to toil to redeem my bond, though I had a run of good luck, I should be ashamed now to claim my own children ! This is what you have brought them and me to, Miss Stewart.\" Supposing this extremity were not reached, an other homely, near-at-hand trouble beset Kirsten from the first moment of convalescence. How should she rejoin the children, when she was dis charged from the hospital, cured so far as she herself had to do with the fever, nominally dis infected, like the cab which had brought her, but for ought that she knew, still invested with peril and death to all who came near her ; as fatal as an importation of dynamite to Mrs. Dawes' apartments ? The presence of Kirsten might prove the very Gorgon's head to Katie, and Beville, and Sa. Assailed on every side by distressing reflections, unfit to cope with them in her weakened state, Kirsten broke down, as she did not do more than"], [217, "An Hospital Confidence. 205 once or twice in her whole arduous career. She turned her face to the wall and fell into a passion of disconsolateness. The nurse in charge tried the stereotyped remonstrances and coaxing in vain, then, without telling Kirsten, the official passed on the report to one of the doctors, that a patient was fretting herself to fiddle strings, and would have a relapse if she were not pulled up. Accordingly, Kirsten found herself called to order by a cheery young voice, with a tone of command in it, which even before she had time to think, sounded comical. On looking round she saw the blonde hair, and complexion, and strapping figure of her earliest doctor in the fever. \" Come, come ! \" he said again, with his good natured imperiousness. \" What is all this about ? You are all right, or you'll soon be. You ought to entertain some gratitude for your recovery, in place of going on like a baby, and doing your best to put an end to yourself.\" Kirsten was taken aback by the uncompromising directness of the reproof. At the same time, she was struck by the generally youthful air of the person who thus called her to order, by the sense that the smooth forehead had never brooded over a heavier difficulty than a \" tough \" lecture, or the clear blue eyes been dimmed by a more cruel dis appointment than a baulked football match, or a denied holiday. She felt like a grandmother by"], [218, "206 Her Gentle Deeds. comparison, and could not resist a sad little smile at the incongruity of the tone he adopted to her, such a tone as an experienced sage might use to a foolish child. \" Now, that is better \" ; he hailed the smile in exactly the same manner ; \" but we must have no more ofthis nonsense, remember.\" \"I do not mean to be a trouble,\" Kirsten hastened to explain with a little falter in her voice, \" but I cannot help it.\" \" Bosh ! \" he told her, without so much as begging her pardon. \"You think so, but you are quite wrong, it is all that you know about it.\" \" And what do you know about it ? \" Kirsten thought, smiling more heartily this time, at the utter ludicrousness of the idea. It was one of Kirsten's sweet glad smiles, in itself the most beauti ful smile that could be beheld. It was sufficiently shy on the face of a woman, whose very personal attractions were unobtrusive, like everything else about her, so that many inobservant or spoilt people would have passed it by unheeded. But if any com petent person's attention became arrested and fixed by it, it was a smile which could not be forgotten, it cheered the spirit like a sunbeam, and dwelt in the memory like the scent of lavender. Kirsten had been sitting up, wearing a scarlet dressing jacket, which she had brought with her. This attribute of her invalid condition was a great"], [219, "An Hospital Confidence. 207 deal more brilliant than any part of her usual dress in health, in fact, it made her look quite a gay figure among the washed-out tints of the hospital ward, like a robin-redbreast in the centre of the common sober-hued birds. She had been able to arrange her fine brown hair in its simple, graceful, orderly fashion. The flush of fever had left her cheek, and there was a dainty delicate transparency in the paleness relieved against the red of the jacket, while her eyes looked larger and brighter even behind their unshed tears than they were wont to look. The young doctor took in the entire picture, grew slightly confused, sat down in the nurse's chair in stead of towering over his patient, and removed the hat which he had put on to go out, and had not troubled himself to take off when the nurse's com munication reached him. \"Can I do anything for you?\" he asked gravely this time, and rather eagerly. Kirsten had not been tempted to confide in the nurse, far too busy and important a woman to strike a reserved, reluctant petitioner as likely to prove a patient, sympathetic listener. The regular house surgeon was equally hors de combat, above and beyond Kirsten's reach. There were no \"sisters\" or ladies on probation in the ward. The \"jolly looking\" young doctor, as he would have described himself, did not look a particularly promising confidant for a tale of trouble, but necessity"], [220, "208 Her Gentle Deeds. admits of no choice. It flashed upon Kirsten how near he dwelt to her treasures and the spot she was constantly thinking about, for she had not forgotten that this was the heaven-sent doctor who lived as she had done in Howard Street, who had given her the order for the hospital. He could do her such a little service, as she would hardly have refused to a dis honest beggar, which would yet be the most blessed relief to her oppressed mind. He could satisfy her on one distracting point. She seized the opportunity, lest her natural quietness and diffidence should get the better of her, and still keep her lips shut. \" It is the children I cannot rest for,\" she said hastily, her breast heaving. \" Children ! \" he exclaimed, with a sort of wonder and dismay. \"Have you children?\" Then he checked himself, as if he began to recognise that Kirsten was beyond the pale of free-and-easy ques tioning, while he felt considerable chagrin for his former performance in this respect. \"Yes, I have them under my care,\" she answered in her unconsciousness, relieving his discomfiture by the qualification of her words. \" I left them at No. 9, Howard Street, with Mrs. Dawes, who went with me to consult you. It would be a very great favour \u2014 I am afraid it sounds like a liberty \u2014 but, indeed, I cannot help myself, and I hope you will forgive me if I am asking too much,\" stammered Kirsten, inad vertently clasping her hands, much more used to"], [221, "A . . Hospital Confidence. 209 conferring than to soliciting obligations \u2014 humble minded as she was. \" It would be the greatest favour if you could send round and find how the children are, if they are still there, and let me know.\" \" Say no more,\" he interrupted her quickly ; \" I can call myself, with no trouble in the world, and bring you word.\" \" Oh, thank you, thank you !\" she told him grate fully. But in the case of such a woman as Kirsten, however cordial she may be, her thanks are not more profuse than her petitions ; yet she was meditating another request, easier, more in the natural course of their relations as doctor and patient, nevertheless, it cost her another effort to make it, in her strong ob jection to giving trouble. \" Will you be so good as to tell me,\" she said deprecatingly and deferentially, for she was sensible she forestalled a question, and he might think she had no right to anticipate a piece of information, or to cause him to repeat it twice, with changes hung on it, \" how soon will it be safe for me to return to the children ? \" \" Well,\" he said, \" we are not going to turn you out before you are quite recovered. I hope you can trust us so far.\" He spoke with some resumption of the old familiarity on its kindly side, but with nothing that could be counted a lack of ceremony this time. \" We'll disinfect you to the best of our ability, you may rely upon it. But with regard to your coming into immediate contact with the children,\" he added p"], [222, "Her Gentle Deeds. 210 after a moment's consideration, \" it would be better if you could get a fortnight at the sea-side.\" Watching her as he was now doing with aroused curiosity and lively interest, he observed her face fall. \" Poor soul ! \" he thought, \" she is in low water indeed. Some curate's daughter at the head of his small family. But why does the man not look after her ? unless the solemn ass is frightened for com promising the dignity ofthe Church. What becomes of her womanly dignity ? Not that it has ever been invaded, but I wish she could have had a room to herself. I do wish I had not been such a blundering idiot as to speak to her in the cool fashion I did. Nurse Barker dropped no hint. Very likely she did not detect the crucial difference because her patient gave herself no airs. But if I could be such a thundering fool, how can I expect a working woman, crammed with rules till there is no room left for mother-wit, to act more wisely ? \" The young doctor was discontented with everybody, even with Kirsten, at the very moment he was telling himself, \" This girl is one of nature's gentlewomen, through and through, in whatever class she may have been born and bred. I don't know if she's pretty \u2014 a fellow is worse than a coxcomb or a cad to my mind if he thinks first of the looks of a patient. I should rather call her lovely, lovable, or whatever the word may mean \u2014 gentille, or aimable the French would say \u2014 or a ' genty, winsome lassie,' the old Scotch would have"], [223, "An Hospital Confidence. 211 had it. But what on earth is she doing here in an hospital ? And I'll eat my hat, if it was a lady who brought her to me and bedewed her with tears at parting.\" He ended by giving her a respectful part ing assurance that he would attend to her wishes. Kirsten's Mercury was as good as his word. He still had the puzzled look in his face, but it wore also a glow of pleasure when he came round with the house-surgeon next morning. Kirsten did not suspect that there had been any breach of etiquette in the confidence she had bestowed, but if she had known it, she would have been more indebted than she could have expressed to the better-informed person, who, young as he was, had the manly sense of honour and good feeling which constrained him to set her right, while he took the utmost care not to hurt her in the process. \"This patient has been fretting herself ill \" ; he told the whole story in her hearing to the master of the situation. \" The nurse knowing that you were engaged summoned me to stop the mischief, and I undertook to look up some information about the patient's family for her.\" \" Quite so,\" commented the responsible function ary laconically. \" She is no worse this morning ; she is doing very well.\" He passed on to the next bed while his companion lingered to unfold his budget with all the speed called for under the cir cumstances. p 2"], [224, "Her Gentle Deeds. 212 \" I went to number nine after I left the hospital yesterday, and found everybody flourishing. I sa w a little pickle, who proposed to borrow my knife, and a small woman, who asked if I should like a cup of tea. The baby did not speak, in fact she was crying so lustily that she had no breath to spare ; but it was only a humour she was in \u2014 babies don't cry like that when there is anything physically wrong. The landlady bade me tell you they were all first rate, while they were longing to have you back again. I had fifty more messages, which I have not time to deliver, since I must follow my chief. Now, will that do ? and will you leave off gratuitous tormenting, and take to rejoicing instead. which will be much better for your health ? \" \" I shall take to thanking you,\" said Kirsten, in her simple gladness. \" Then I must be off.\" By a chapter of accidents that was the last communication which Kirsten had in the hospital with her friendly messenger. His duty took him to another ward, and kept him there to relieve a young surgeon, who had broken down. In the meantime Kirsten received a letter from Mrs. Dawes, con taining, to Kirsten's surprise, one of her five-pound notes. No, it was not one of hers ; it was one of Mr. Barnard's, to whom, however, the landlady had not applied. But a clerk from the bank had called, made a few inquiries, and after his visit this"], [225, "An Hospital Confidence. 213 enclosure had come from his principal. Mrs. Dawes could go on without breaking it, and she had forwarded it to its owner because of something said by the medical gentleman from number eleven, when he was so good as to call, and no fault to be found, since doctors can go anywhere. He had mentioned that it would be better for Miss Stewart to take a trip to the sea-side before she returned to Howard Street. Mrs. Dawes placed implicit reliance on Miss Stewart's discretion. She \u2014 Mrs. Dawes \u2014 had some qualms about \" these sea-side landladies,\" who might be receiving the plague unawares, but she left it all to the doctor and Miss Stewart. Kirsten looked askance at the five-pound note, while a faint colour rose in her pale cheeks. It was neither more nor less than a charitable gift, sheer alms extorted against Mr. Barnard's reason and his sense of consistency, by the exigencies of the case. And she was the daughter of a brave officer and of a \u2022delicate-minded gentlewoman, not to say of doughty old Stewarts by the score ; nay, more, she was as brave in her way as her father had been in his, as delicate-minded as her mother, and probably a good deal more independent than the most rampant old Stewart who ever levied black-mail. She had thought to work her fingers to the bone, but not to take charity, not private charity. As to a public provision for the destitute, it had been her aim mistaken, perhaps \u2014 to keep the Owens from falling"], [226, "Her Gentle Deeds. 214 back upon it. Yet the scruples which she had felt about going to the hospital had not arisen from this cause. The hospital represented one of those common bounties, to which all had contributed more or less, on which all had a claim. But was there such a great distinction here, after all ? Mr. Barnard's five-pound note did not necessarily stand for anything else than Kirsten her self would have unhesitatingly given in similar circumstances had she been a rich woman. If she took the money, it would be for the sake of the children and Mrs. Dawes, whose interests Kirsten dared not imperil for her own gentle pride. She would accept the help this for her [family ; afterwards, please God, she might be sufficient for them, and if she were exceptionally fortunate, she could repay Mr. Barnard. Kirsten was saved from concern about imposing herself on an unfortunate though enlightened sea-side landlady by hearing of a sanatorium where a fever convalescent could bestow herself without the horror of becoming a source of disaster wherever she went. She had a letter written for her and dispatched to Mrs. Dawes, and departed feebly but hopefully from the hospital, smothering a throb of pain when she heard of other patients' friends waiting for their dis missal, while she had no well-known door open for her, no shout of welcome raised for her. That was all awaiting her, she told herself with determined,"], [227, "An Hospital Confidence. 215 patient cheerfulness. With regard to another soli tary experience among strangers, she congratulated herself on becoming the most adventurous of women, though at present she was going no farther off than Brighton. The next thing that would happen, she would be setting out alone and without a penny on a voyage round the world, or an expedition to the heights of Chimporazo or the depths of Timbuctoo. Kirsten surmounted the sanatorium as she had sur mounted the hospital, the more successfully in the latter instance that she was able to appreciate the deep peace and positive gladness of recovery, and the agreeable change from London to the sea-side in the height of summer. If only the children had been with her to profit by the fresh breezes, the water and the stones ! And if Mrs. Dawes and Emily Anne had been permitted to join the party, Kirsten's satisfaction would have been still more complete, though she might not have shared the enthusiasm of the two last-comers for the pier and the band. The tender, tremulous heart could hardly take the goods the gods had sent her, because of her regret that she could not share them with others, especially with the little ones dependent on her for every morsel they ate. Kirsten had not too much money, when it is taken into consideration that in addition to paying her board and travelling expenses, she had to equip herself in an entirely new fever-proof suit in which"], [228, "Her Gentle Deeds. 216 to return to Howard Street. She had to content herself with the smallest offering to drop into the sana torium thanksgiving-box, the most modest savings to carry back with her and put into the common purse. She could furnish herself with nothing better than shells and wild flowers to take to the children. All the same, there was extravagant jubilation in number nine on the long and eagerly looked-forward to afternoon of Kirsten's return. It was the very dullest and deadest season of the year, so far as custom to London furnished apart ments went. Mrs. Dawes, not being provided with a permanent lodger in the shape of a run-down officer with a bad leg and a terrific temper, had every room in the house on her hands ; the more's the pity ; only as it is an ill wind which blows nobody good, the vacancy insured leisure and space for the revel, and for the display ofthe accomplish ments which the children had learnt in Kirsten's absence. The small performers were burning to make the exhibition for her benefit. Katie's ambi tion had taken a new bent ; she was as proud of her attainments in the character of a small housemaid as she had ever been on her pre-eminence in the role of a school-girl. She could dust better than Emily Anne. Mrs. Dawes could trust Katie with the china. She out-whisked Mrs. Dawes herself with the feather-brush. Beville was learning to clean knives and shoes as dexterously as the small boy,"], [229, "An Hospital Confidence. 217 Charles Dickens, covered and labelled blacking-pots. Beville could go on an errand in the Strand without losing himself, or letting himself be run over. Kirsten listened wistfully, and thought of the mother and her opinions. But still the listener said nothing to damp the innocent exultation of these debutantes in mental occupations, and she received with all her own unassuming graciousness Mrs. Dawes' somewhat troubled explanations. She had let the children try to be useful, to keep them out of mischief, and to teach them to help themselves, be cause there was nothing so bad as \" them idle ways \" for making and keeping children naughty. It would do nobody harm to be able to turn \" their 'ands to this or that in any spere.\" \" Can do\" was easily carried about with you. How can we tell whether in the spiritual world the degrees of indignity and dignity involved in sweeping a floor or polishing knives, and in acquiring and dispensing even the least doubtful of French and Latin, or the most melodious of music, may not suffer some amount of reversal ? Mrs. Dawes and Dr. Watts were right as to the evil of idleness, while, even without foreboding a revolution, with only a view to the colonies or to the advanced days when no civilised being will be a domestic servant, general proficiency in homely performances is not to be despised. The adaptability of children is a .blessed inheritance to begin with."], [230, "218 Her Gentle Deeds. After all, the baby, Sa, so far outdid her brother and sister in the greatness and splendid significance of the attainments she had made during Kirsten's absence. In that short period of five weeks she had accomplished two of the feats which separate man from the lower animals. She had cut her teeth, as everybody there knew to his or her cost, long before; but when it came to that, dogs, even cats, had teeth. Now she could stand upright \u2014 not without tottering \u2014 and walk in a swaying fashion across the floor. She could speak \u2014 not very intelligibly, but still with a meaning and method in the syllables unknown to the most accomplished parrots or starlings. She had passed the two eras which parents and guardians unconsciously hail, without any mother to boast in a proud father's hearing. But Katie and Beville, Mrs. Dawes and Emily Anne, had done their best to supply the want in that wonderful, more than half pathetic interest, which every young human animal inspires in the elders of the tribe, even when these are not its immediate progenitors. The family, from the oldest to the youngest, had been keenly alive to Sa's progress, and had shared in the triumph of her success. Sa's gleeful laugh at her own distinguished deeds was matched by Mrs. Dawes' \" Bless the hinfant ! \" and Emily Anne's \" Pretty dear ! \" while Katie and Beville chimed in with \"Well done!\" \" Go it, baby ! \" The whole house had combined to coach Sa to"], [231, "An Hospital Confidence. 219 greet Miss Stewart with a speech, and had hung back inexplicably to Kirsten, with their eyes dwel ling in an agony of suspense on the miniature per formance. Unfortunately for the complete fulfilment of the programme, Kirsten's new dress was trimmed with buttons which bulked so largely in the baby's eyes that she could see nothing else, and as she did not know their names she could not mention them. In the meantime Kirsten was sufficiently impressed by the sight of the child in the foreground, on her own little legs, without any exterior support. Kir sten too was weak enough to cry ecstatically, \" Why, my baby is walking ! \" as if no other baby had ever walked before, \" and none of you ever told me ! \" \" Speak, Sa,\" \" Speak, Button,\" adjured Katie and Beville, in the loudest, most desperate stage whisper, the last epithet adopted on the spur of the moment from the innocent object that was manifestly striking Sa dumb, or reducing her to inarticulate sounds again. Beville used his appeal very much like an incantation, and it had a wonderful effect. \" Kis,\" said the child, making a sound not unlike that produced by some simply ingenious machinery, such as the contrivance which causes dolls to squeak. Katie rushed into a voluble apology, interpretation, and commentary in one. \" You must excuse her, Miss Stewart ; she does not know any better, she cannot do any better \u2014 not though you waste ever so much sugar, and threaten to put her in a room. We"], [232, "Her Gentle Deeds. 220 tried to teach her to say ' Miss Stewart,' but her tongue would not go about it. She called ' Miss ' ' Sis,' why I am sure I cannot tell. It might have done for me, you know, because I am her sister, but not for you. At last, one day when I was reading aloud one of your letters from Brighton, I came to your signature, 'Kirsten Stewart,' and like magic baby caught it up and coolly called out ' Kis ' ; so we hope you'll not mind the liberty, but let her say it till she is older and can speak plainly.\" Mind, indeed ! Kirsten thought it the sweetest sound she had ever heard fall from human lips, next to \" Kirsty,\" which her father and mother had called her when a child. She put her own interpretation on the monosyllable and illustrated it half-a-dozen times on the spot. It had come to this, that while Kirsten had de murred at her eldest pupil's addressing her teacher by her full, decorous Christian name on the first evening of their acquaintance, the same woman per mitted, without the smallest objection, this morsel of flesh and blood to abbreviate the title into the most free-and-easy ridiculous contraction. Such are the inconsistencies of mortals, and such is the sovereignty of babies. Amidst all the confusing crowd of communications which pressed on the attention on her restoration to her place, Kirsten had a bit of news from Mrs. Dawes. \" That doctor at number eleven, he is gone for"], [233, "An Hospital Confidence. 221 good, Miss. I'll tell you how I came to know it. After he was so polite as to bring your message, and hask after us all for your benefit, he called again the night before last. He seemed a trifle disappointed as well as flurried-like, which it might be because he was 'urried with his packing, since he was just a-setting off for the country, as he told me with his own lips, Miss. ' I should 'ave just liked to see how she was getting on, though, of course, it is not my business now,' he said. I did not hunderstand him, for I 'ave always 'eared the 'ospital takes hout patients, and you are 'ardly out of the doctor's 'ands, till he added that he was going to take a hopening in the country where his people were. He 'ad been waiting for it, and 'ad only come to fill a gap in the 'ospital. I told him it 'ad been a lucky chance for us, and I would venture on wishing him success, while I was certain you would do the same, and would be very sorry likewise that you 'ad missed his call. But he said it didn't ought to signify, since you were better. It was as well. He seemed to think either that you might feel bound to hoffer him a fee, now that you are hout of the 'ospital, which would be as good as throwing away money that is none too plentiful, or else that you might not like his coming 'ere without being sent for. So I made him hout, Miss.\" \" Oh, yes,\" said Kirsten quickly, \" it is as well.\" Then she thought to herself, \" He was very"], [234, "Her Gentle Deeds. 222 pleasant and kind after he had found out his little mistake. He looked a fine young fellow, whom I might have liked to know under more favourable circumstances, especially as he was a fellow-country man. I am sure of that. Another exile in Babylon, who would give a penny to the organ-grinder that murders a Scotch tune, and would never fail to be present at a national gathering or ballad-concert on St. Andrew's day. But as it is, what have I to do with such acquaintances ? I cannot afford them. They would only be fruitful in awkwardness and trouble. He is right, it is as well.\" .1"], [235, "CHAPTER XV. SEEKING WORK. HAT night Kirsten fell asleep with Sa in her arms, Katie in her little bed opposite, and Beville in the next room. It was like being at home again, out of the cold, surrounded by those she had made her own. There are human natures that grow up independent and self-sufficing. There are creatures with a high and holy vocation, who hold constant exalted com munion with the unseen, and so may be well content to dispense to a great extent with earthly fellowship. There are unsocial souls, that rather shrink from sympathy than desire it. And there are eminently genial beings, like Kirsten, to whom separation from near intercourse with their kind and isolation with their own interests, be they ever so attractive and engrossing in themselves, are like a living death, in which it feels as if their whole faculties must contract and wither. Kirsten thanked God from the bottom of her heart the night that saw her back in Howard Street for the children thrown upon"], [236, "Her Gentle Deeds. 224 her hands, for the friendly, homely faces of Mrs Dawes and Emily Anne. Kirsten made a new start in seeking work without any interruption this time, unless from the fact that the great metropolis was, as Mrs. Dawes complained, \" as dull as ditch-water \" under the untimely fierce- ness even of the English sun, and in the exhausted air of a London August, when some of the writers of the newspaper leaders, goaded and stung by a forced detention amongst bricks and mortar, kept comparing the still swarming city to Tadmor in the Wilderness. No doubt the closed great houses in the West-end, with the flowers running to seed in the balconies, were patent to tyros, but it required the initiated to appreciate the thinning of the thronged streets. \" There are plenty of people left, though they may be nobodies. How can I expect a some- body to engage me ? I shall only be able to get about the better,\" said Kirsten stoutly. Then as the days passed, and she had to suffer the sickness of hope deferred, she tried to take consolation from the reflection, \" Perhaps I might have done better at another season. It may be the time of year which is against me after all. Of course every family that could go out of town has gone to the sea-side, and does not want a governess there.\" For Kirsten had to encounter in full the terrible difficulty, which a girl such as she was finds, in pro curing work to keep her and those dependent"], [237, "Seeking Work. 225 on her in bread in this England, the prosperity of which is not altogether a thing of the past ; in this London, which even in the worst of times is first in power and luxury, as it is also first in impotence and want, as other cities are first in splendour and pleasure, among the capitals of Europe. Kirsten's first practical encounter was with agencies. As these, with the addresses of which Mr. Barnard had furnished -her, were of all others the most stultified by the end of the season and were the most peremptory on the points, either of regular professional training or of shining accomplishments \u2014 foreign languages as spoken like the native speech, music only second to that of Herr von Biilow or Madame Schumann, drawing and painting to shame the art schools \u2014 Kirsten was soon driven back on the lower agencies. She was saved from the lowest by her own sensible and good perceptions\u2014 what might be called the odour of intelligence and virtue about her, and by Mrs. Dawes' knowledge of the world in its humbler phases. It was bad enough as it was, though Kirsten was delivered from an evil contact which could only have caused her sore morti fication and affront and violent revulsion. She could make little of the middle-class agencies to which she applied. Their plan seemed to begin and end in the best mode to extract half-crowns by means of advertisements, old and new, and books of entries, which, if they were not absolutely false and fraudulent, Q"], [238, "226 Her Gentle Deeds. were well known to be, in innumerable instances, of no avail to the enquirers. For even if the entries were not out of date, they had been answered over and over again. The same addresses of ladies and gentlemen, announcing themselves in want of gover nesses with specified attainments, had been given already to at least a score of qualified governesses who had come earlier to the offices. And these filched-away half-crowns stood not rarely for such solid equivalents as the week's milk for Sa, the calico to make the frock which began to be an urgent necessity for Katie, the linen to replace the blouse which Beville had torn beyond the power of mending. After Kirsten had visited several agencies, and had her grave, sad thoughts both of the pert and flighty, and the broken-spirited and stupefied community circulating there, she came to the conclusion that in vestments of half-crowns and long walks \u2014 with their waste of boots \u2014 were not sufficiently recompensed. The usual result was getting addresses the owners of which, when communicated with, by a process which involved a fresh expenditure of paper, ink, and postage stamps, either did not answer \u2014 probably overwhelmed by the voluminousness of this branch of their correspondence \u2014 or replied with succinct thanks and intimations that the gentleman or lady was already suited or was on terms with other governesses, or did not require a governess for the"], [239, "Seeking Work 227 next three or six months, when, if the applicant chose, she might write again. Kirsten fondly imagined that this was a trial of patience faintly approximating to that of Job. But she was assured by some of the members of her craft, with whom she picked up a speaking acquaintance in those days of hunting in common for an engage ment, that she knew little or nothing of what they had to go through. She had copied testimonials till she could say them by heart, while the wearisome repetition of her own qualifications and achievements rendered her dazed in mind and sick at heart, and tempted her to peril the originals, which were the chief weapons of war, by casting them on the waters of agency addresses. Kirsten was sometimes fain to believe that she was well quit of those pro fessional recommendations, the lack of which, never theless, threatened to prove a fatal obstacle to the attainment of her object. Kirsten resolved to follow the advice of some of her companions and try advertising. At least, if answers came, they would be as it were genuine and her private property, not distributed promis cuously like the agency addresses over scores of impecunious young women. It was an important moment when Kirsten penned the modest advertisement of her wishes and powers as a governess or companion, or a daily governess, looking out for a situation within walking distance Q 2"], [240, "228 Her Gentle Deeds. of the Strand. She read it aloud to Mrs. Dawes, and even to Katie and Beville, for the sympathising heart craved sympathy. All were more or less impressed by the eloquence of the matter-of-fact lines, rigidly limited as they were by the charge for each word. Katie Owen was infected with an ardent desire to follow suit, and advertise on the spot for a junior housemaid's or nurserymaid's place. Why not tidy other rooms or keep another baby, instead of Mrs. Dawes' \"apartments\" or Sa? Beville might be told off to look after Sa. He was younger than Katie, and his boot and knife cleaning did not always come to much, whereas Katie's dusting of table and chairs, and scrubbing of baby's face and toasting of her toes never found themselves neglected. The selection of a newspaper for that remarkable advertisement, the mere dropping of it into the letter-box, and, above all, the appearance of the production in print, were all so many eras to be remembered in the affair. But the grand climax was the successive arrival, in the course of so many hours or days, of one, two, three answers, all addressed unmistakably to Kirsten. For in her unsophisticated ness and sincerity, she had failed to see the propriety of making a mystery of her act, and shielding her identity behind a number or a letter, or a lacka daisical motto, as if she were in jest, not in earnest, playing at a game rather than doing a piece of business. No ; Kirsten gave her full name, \" Kirsten"], [241, "Seeking Work. 229 Stewart, care of Mrs. Dawes, g, Howard Street, Norfolk Street, Strand.\" Now her difficulties appeared at an end, for it could not be that three answers to an announcement as clearly, if concisely, made as the English language could put it, should all break down through mis understandings and contradictory obligations. Mrs. Dawes' long face was on the threshold, Emily Anne hovered in the background, Katie and Beville were jumping ecstatically round the recipient of the letters. The first letter read agreeably decisive. Mrs. Willoughby Martin, in reply to the advertisement,. believed the advertiser was the governess Mrs. Willoughby M. was in search of. Would the young lady be so good as to come down to Wimbledon next day, between the hours often and eleven a.m., and have a personal interview with Mrs. W. M., at the Beeches, Warden Road, within a quarter of an hour's walk of the station. P.S. \u2014 Mrs. Willoughby Martin thought it was right to mention she did not allow travelling expenses. The last warning might be fair and above board, but it did not sound very liberal of Mrs. W. M., for whose convenience and pleasure the traveller was going down to be inspected. However, Kirsten had already learned painfully that governesses' situations are by no means as plentiful as blackberries to privates in the great unwieldy, more than half dilapidated, army of governesses, while a daily"], [242, "Her Gentle Deeds. 230 governess's situation within reach of the Strand might not exist for her. Kirsten must take what she could find, and be thankful to secure any pro vision for herself andthe children. And she strove to feel hopeful that Mrs. Willoughby Martin, though she was stringent on small points of travelling expenses, might be more liberal on the larger question of salary. Kirsten laboured to persuade herself that such discrepancies in character and conduct were so frequent as to be quite common, while she was whirled along in the heat and dust of an August train to the common memorable for volunteer man\u0153uvres and festivities. What athletic limbs in soldierly costumes, and bold light hearts, bound for cheery patriotic competition, with abundant merriment for men of mirth, these carriages were wont to carry at the appointed season, when North and South, Ireland and Wales, a Canadian or an Australian team, Lords and Commons, each con tended for a share in the victory, and royalty distributed the prizes ! Kirsten spared a thought for the gay scene, with her father's interest in reading of the contests, and his exultation when his country men were declared the conquerors. She had also attention to spare for the beauty and luxury of the suburban home in which she expected to dwell as a retainer. What well-off children to have shrubberies and gardens like these to play in ! What a happy house-mother and mistress to rule"], [243, "Seeking Work. 231 over such a fine domain and make it free to her children and people. There were grape-vines and aloes, not unlike the passion-vines and cacti of which her, Kirsten's, children still spoke, but kept up at an immeasurably greater expense here, where the strangers met, mingled, and shook hands with the pines and gorse, true denizens of the common, which would have been exotics in Australia. Kirsten was passed on by a regular staff of upper class servants, too decorous to be obtrusively super cilious, to a pleasant morning-room, where she was a little startled to find five duplicates of herself sitting waiting \u2014 five other young ladies or \"persons,\" all dressed for the occasion with studied quietness, as well as manifest economy in parasols and gloves, all looking as if they had come on the same errand of application for the situation of governess in the family ; indeed, as if they were summoned by its head to be engaged to fill the coveted office. Could Mrs. W. M. keep six governesses ? or had she been just a trifle reticent in her frankness ? Had she answered six newspaper advertisements, and in vited in the same form of words six unpaid travellers, each with the conviction that she was spending her poor little fare in journeying to Wimbledon with the moral certainty of being then and there hired ? It was so, and the little party sat and looked at each other with dark suspicions of the truth and growing awkwardness, till the comic soul ofthe batch"], [244, "Her Gentle Deeds. 232 was prompted to laugh and the shrew of the lot driven to scold. In the meantime, one after another was selected, shown out into another room, and treated to a meeting with the presiding genius of the situation, carefully examined, and eventually dis missed with a cautiously indefinite yet perfectly courteous intimation that Mrs. Willoughby Martin, so soon as she had made up her mind, would let the young lady know the result. When it came to Kirsten's turn to be looked at and cross-questioned, she found herself in the presence of a gentle, kind-looking being, in the most choice morning-gown, amidst the most exquisite surround ings. She spoke in a friendly, half-playful way, and seemed as unconscious as she was incapable of taking advantage of her less fortunate fellow-creatures, and mulcting them of a mite in order to fill up the measure of her abundance. But Kirsten, being neither self-confident nor san guine, had but the slenderest expectation of being the favoured one in six ; accordingly in due time a tiny note, in graceful handwriting, with a charming monogram, put her out of pain. Mrs. Willoughby Martin had engaged another governess, and did not waste her valuable time in expressing regret for any thing she had cost Kirsten. The second letter, to Kirsten's surprise, had con sisted of four closely- written sheets of letter paper. Clearly the wholesome restraint of a monetary charge;"], [245, "Seeking Work. 233 on each word was not in force here, and the writer did not grudge her trouble. Unmistakably it was a woman who thus poured forth her soul on paper. However, if a written communication were to take the place of a personal interview there might be some reason for the diffuseness. The writer began by recapitulating Kirsten's per fectly well-remembered advertisement, and then diverged into an endless labyrinth of questions, stipu lations, and announcement of the employer's views. Was Kirsten very fond of children ? Had she the best method of managing them ? Could she be firm and at the same time indulgent ? Were her religious principles and practice unexceptionable ? and had she the faculty of imparting them to children without teasing, worrying, or repelling them ? The writer's children were rather backward, but it was from no want of intelligence on their part ; indeed they were more than usually intelligent, but they had been very unfortunate in their previous teachers. The children were high-spirited and a little wild, but not in the least ill-disposed, and if the proper plan were taken with them everything could be done. But the writer must insist on the absence of all habitual curbing, and that no discipline should be attempted without her express knowledge and consent. Would Kirsten be so good as to state what musical system she went on, and the course of French she would follow? Would she undertake fluent French conversation ?"], [246, "Her Gentle Deeds. 234 Had she any provincial accent ? The writer was the more induced to put these necessary questions be cause, from the advertiser's very singular Christian name, it appeared she must either come from a re mote part of the country or be partly of foreign origin. If foreign, what was the nationality ? The lady wishing a governess would not object to a connection with North Germany or Eastern France ? How long had Kirsten been with her last employer? What was her reason for quitting the situation ? Did she relinquish it ? or were her services not required any longer ? Would she be so good as to forward imme diately all her written testimonials and personal references ? If these were perfectly satisfactory, then an arrangement might be made for a personal inter view, without which of course nothing could be decided. Such are some gleanings from the letter. It was a matter of course that the prolix, minute, imperative, and inquisitive document should be still further weakened in vain effort to strengthen it by prodigal promiscuous underlining. Kirsten contemplated the result with unmitigated dismay. \" I should be a model governess, indeed, if I could answer all these questions satisfactorily. Cannot the writer see that she is offering a premium to hypocrisy and imposition ? I might have the best plan for managing children, and my religious principles and practice might be unexceptionable,"], [247, "Seeking Work. 235 but I should be a vain fool and worse if I thought, and still more if I said so. And how do I know that my standard is hers ? On the other hand, if I were a woman of no principle, how easy it would be for me to say ' yes,' and assure her I was everything she could desire or imagine \u2014 unless she subjected me to some unfailing test.\" It is only natural and right that mothers should be anxious about the persons to whom they com mit their best possessions. But in the name of modest common-sense, ought not the mistresses of families to be content with a degree of perfection within the bounds of ordinary human attainments. Would the employer's turn not be served by a worthy, fairly educated girl, though she might be slightly to blame in her judgment and temper at times, while her French was not so colloquial as could be wished ? It was more than probable that the pupils would seldom be in the way of conversing in strange tongues. When all was said, ought not the parents to take something on trust, to confide to a certain extent in their deputies, to refrain from guarding their guards ? Kirsten thought she had concluded the cor respondence by simply writing that she could not undertake the situation. But the next post brought her a recapitulation of the requirements and prohibi tions, with a few more investigations and ordinances, and a peremptory command to forward her testi-"], [248, "236 Her Gentle Deeds. monials and references by return of post, so that the writer might judge of Kirsten's fitness for the post. With regard to the third of Kirsten's letters, she had to undergo a repetition of the experience of the first with alleviations. There was not in this pro duction a shadow of the graceful shyness, or, what Beville, with his marvellous juvenile aptitude for slang, called the \" my eyeness,\" which had characterised the former laudable endeavour to take care of the pence, in order that the pounds might take care of themselves. The writer told Kirsten plainly she was on terms with more than one gover ness already, and she did not ask the new com petitor to pay the charges for gratifying the judge's fancy to see and speak with an additional aspirant, whose chances of success were the poor prospects of the last comer. Without doubt Kirsten Stewart was not calculated to take the world by storm, else the world would be a wiser and better world than, it is to be feared, most people find it. Her quiet, comely face, and the pleasant retiring good breeding of her address, did not stir up employers to engage her, though it prompted many a miserable street-beggar, weary wayfarer who had lost the road, or truant child seeking to know the hour, to accost the owner of that face and address. It might be because a large portion of the governing world proved too hurried to read the traits, or, let us hope for the sake of"], [249, "Seeking Work. 237 human nature, similar traits were not altogether uncommon. A fourth letter, which had come after its time, and been received at first with gleeful derision as quite a supernumerary epistle, proved supernumerary in other senses. Kirsten had imagined she had dis tinctly stated what she knew, and could teach others ; yet here was an inquirer calmly interrogating the advertiser whether she had studied Spanish, and if she \" professed \" the guitar as well as the piano ? She, too scrupulous young woman, had to waste several minutes and a stamp in answering in the negative. Was it possible that ladies had taken to disporting themselves, and getting rid of some of their spare time, by means of advertising governesses, as the same ladies \" play \" with fagged shopmen and women ? Apart from possessed egotists and incorrigible blunderers, everywhere the same double difficulty presented itself to Kirsten. The supply of gover nesses, of one kind or another, was in immense disproportion to the demand ; and though Kirsten, in her single situation, had done more for her pupils than many thousands of governesses could have done ; though she had consented to die with the children, and was now in danger of starving herself to feed them, she could not show the formal testi monials which were always looked for. She had no written attestation, even if she would have used it,"], [250, "238 Her Gentle Deeds. short of the last extremity, no witness to testify to the facts of the case. She could not engage to bring forward other than personal certificates of character ; she was without professional pledges. Kirsten's advertisement had come to nothing, to the keen disappointment of all interested in it. She must advertise again, spend more of the fast-diminish ing half-crowns, or hang on pinning her faith to the forlorn hope of written cards of her acquirements and reduced terms, which Mrs. Dawes lodged in every shop with which she dealt. Thenceforth it became one of the principal objects of the children's walks that they should go round by those shops, contemplate the familiar formula stuck up among cakes, or eggs, or even sacks of coals (have not the readers of this book seen many such humble, wistful appeals ?), and rush home with the tidings that the card was omitted from the window, or it was favour ably placed, above all, that somebody had been seen reading the contents. Kirsten did not receive great encouragement from those of her fraternity with whom she scraped a superficial acquaintance, bred of common interests and troubles, progressing in a few instances to little friendships, summarily broken in upon by welcome engagements. It was not in the woman's nature to confine herself to her own concerns. She had a taste for abstract questions, which were yet practical in their bearing \u2014 a wide human sympathy with fellow-"], [251, "Seeking Work. 239 labourers and sufferers. And they told her such tales as filled her with compassion for them, and care bordering on anguish for her burden of children. She heard of governesses by ill-luck, by some casual defect or misfortune, remaining out of situations for weeks and months, and at last, shattered by a long course of hope deferred, worry, and disappointment, vanishing into casual-wards, hospitals, and that last refuge, the workhouse, from which Kirsten, with her feeble strength, had held back the Owens. Now if Kirsten would not drag down Mrs. Dawes to the same low level, the girl must be quick in discovering some other resource. Mrs. Dawes had got some of her rooms re-let with the approach of autumn. But in spite or because of her staunchness to the little family she had taken in on the June day, and not cast off with their change of fortunes, she began to look at the children with a disturbed aspect, to hug the baby, to stuff Beville surreptitiously in an imprudent and extravagant fashion, as if in grieved, desperate anticipation of short commons at hand for the little master. Kirsten, in the cooling days, took to haunting with a piteous, indefinite longing various charitable in stitutions, of which she had details from her new friends, who were frequently connected with such nurseries and asylums as orphanages and governesses' homes. In the first the elaborate machinery of patronage and influence, to which Mr. Barnard had"], [252, "Her Gentle Deeds. 240 alluded, was uniformly at work. Nothing was to be done without votes to an appalling amount. In the second there was no room for children \u2014 in fact, Kirsten could not be sure whether there existed much available help for governesses. She might have been unfortunate in the specimen she hit upon, so as to know it best ; but she found the establish ments largely shackled and spoilt by drawbacks peculiar to these places. There was an exaggeration of the excellent idea that they should be self-sup porting, a craze for economy in the arrangements. The governess, while she secured* a safe shelter \u2014 which was in itself an unquestionable boon \u2014 had little gain from the elaborate plan devised to assist her. She would have got about as much from the simple resource of any respectable garret lodging, such as Mrs. Dawes provided for Kirsten, where she was free from the harassing restrictions and small deprivations which pressed on the inmates of the so-called home. A scuttle of coais, which Kirsten was told ormed the allowance for the tolerably large sit ting-room, might keep the temperature above the freezing-point, but it was hardly sufficient to prevent chilblains and coughs among those who had to face the inclement streets, either in pursuing their voca tion as daily governesses, or, what was still more trying, undertaking exhausting expeditions in search of work. The rule against exceptional fires in the"], [253, "Seeking Work. 241 bedrooms, even when the expense would have been met by extra payment for board, pressed severely on delicate persons ; yet the prohibition was explicable on the ground that only a limited number of servants could be employed in the institution, and that their sufficient tale of work must not on any account be increased. But the absolute denial of hot-water bottles or warming-pans sounded like a gratuitous piece of austerity, practised solely for the purpose of inuring young governesses betimes to the hardships which might form an accompaniment to each isolated lot. There was no organised agency in connection witb this Home, though one felt tempted to think ar. agency would have been one of the first advantages to be offered. Still, more curiously, in spite of the committee of clergymen, philanthropists, and be nevolent ladies, of working and honorary secretaries, there was not the slightest supervision exercised over the professional careers of the occupants. With respect to the situations tried for and engaged in, there was no investigation made. Whatever the other restraints, here the governesses were as free as air. They might unwittingly apply in the most un desirable directions, they might ignorantly enter on the most compromising and miserable engagements, not a voice or hand was lifted up to guide, ascertain, warn, dissuade. Excellent women took it as their regular duty in R"], [254, "Her Gentle Deeds. 242 the volunteer office of female curates to hold in formal classes for the working women, and present them with gratis instruction in religion and morals, going over well-beaten tracks of Church and Chapel doctrines, or reading from mildly exciting annals of reformed criminals and juvenile saints. Strange to say, the teachers did not relish the tables being turned upon them, so that they found themselves the taught. They were conceited enough to think they knew the doctrines already, however deficient the scholars might be in living the law and the gospel. The restive listeners could read for themselves if they chose in this or any other field of literature. Why were they alone to be denied the freedom of the subject in disposing of their spare time, scanty enough in all conscience ? It was no shame to a tired young governess that she could not, after a drudging day, feel much inclined for a stale and halting exposition of a truth or a fifth-rate child's story. She had the feelings of her kind. She wished to improve the fast-fleeting moments by making up in private some little article of dress in preparation for her next holiday. Why was she to be deprived of the privilege of writing a long letter, when she could, to one of her few friends ? Was there any harm in her desiring to divert her poor jaded, worried little mind with some innocently enthralling or amusing reading of her own selection, engaged in at her own time ?"], [255, "Seeking Work. 243 And it did seem as if the female curates, with the best intentions, consulting their own convenience as they must have done occasionally, or from the want of tact which was so common a defect, or from pure accident, stumbled in the course oftheir ministrations on the very days and hours, Saturday half-holidays and portions of certain evenings, which were above all others precious and sacred to the victims of philanthropy. It was often only the most time serving motives which brought many of these women to the prescribed gatherings. Sometimes the gover nesses had the spirit or the refractoriness to absent themselves in a body, to the great scandal and morti fication both of the worthy matron and the benevolent visitors. No doubt there were pleasant proofs of kind hearts and generous impulses in other supporters of the Home. Kirsten heard of little treats at Christmas and Easter, special remembrances of foreigners and in valids, spare tickets, not always for grave lectures, but for pretty fancy-fairs and simple ballad concerts, with clever popular readings delivered in the house. But these were the agreeable exceptions to the otherwise harsh, heavy, irksome regimen. There were no friendly conferences in which what the world calls more fortunate, gifted, and prosperous women, blessed or cursed with leisure, set themselves to draw near to those sisters who were often on an intellectual and educational level with themselves. There were no r 2"], [256, "Her Gentle Deeds. 244 attempts to discuss comparative advantages and disadvantages, difficulties and benefits, successes and failures ; to try to help each other \u2014 especially in seeking to relieve the over-burdened and to brighten the not-too-gay existence, were it but by respectful, cordial interest and fellow-feeling, and honest social intercourse. There were no impromptu calls, cozy chats, comfortable tea-drinkings with comparison of domestic accomplishments, arts, or even bits of fancy- work, and transfer of copies or patterns. Yet it is just in such common occupations and natural en- counters that continual unobjectionable opportunities occur for easy equal interchange of favours, when the great can aid the small, and the poor may love the rich. There were no carefully digested well-worked-out schemes for definite courses of instruction from com petent instructors ; no liberal supply of means of self-improvement ; no lectures, no library ; though there was a piano, on which one pertinacious individual was sure to \" strum\" to the inconvenience of her neighbours. There was none of the other clear gains of which every rational governess might have gladly availed herself, so that she would have left happily conscious of being far better fitted for her task than the institution had found her. The incontestable boon of the Home was that the poor homeless governess, in place of being condemned to what might become the heart-breaking, maddening"], [257, "Seeking Work. 245 solitude of a dreary lodging, was in the society of her kind, surrounded by people like herself, launched on the same calling, exposed to similar trials. But after her visits to the Home Kirsten was by no means convinced that this was an unmixed boon. She did not arrive at her conclusion from the rivalry and wrangling to which poor, weak human nature is apt to fall a prey under the circumstances. She could see, even from the most cursory inspection, there were nobler influences at work to counterbalance the evil tendency. There was always honourable evidence of generous magnanimity and unselfish kindness for those who had hearts to comprehend it. But there was much the same moral mischief as the physical mischief said to be done by hospitals for special complaints, which end by becoming centres and storehouses of disease. Kirsten found that the life of governesses herded together grew one-sided and \" shoppy \" to an alarming degree. The members were engrossed not so much by their duties as by their rights, or rather their wrongs. The women dwelt on one little chapter of human history and one phase of life till they blotted out every other. The result was the wholesale narrowing of experience, with a concentration of attention on a single point, which led infallibly to exaggeration and distortion. Morbid and distempered states of mind were fostered ; pre judice had it all its own way; silliness and stupidity,"], [258, "Her Gentle Deeds. 246 spleen and spite, flourished. A governesses' league was in course of formation, not very formidable from the nature of its materials, but piteous on other accounts. It served as a fresh illustration of the gulf widening and the enmity increasing between employers and employed. It meant the warping and marring of many a simple nature. Kirsten's hair stood on end when she learnt for herself the light in which honourable services began to be regarded by many of her fellow-servants. How purely mercenary, how cunning, how slavish, how vindictive its conditions were growing. To take all that could be got and give nothing which could be decently withheld ; to comply with the pound of flesh, but not to vouchsafe a drop of blood ; to extort every privilege and perquisite, at whatever trouble and loss to the granter ; to stand up for one's due ; to refuse to be put upon ; to speak fair when it answered a purpose ; to retaliate by insubordination and insult when the purpose was answered. The white-heat of the unequal, desperate contest was maintained by a never-failing inflaming record of tyrannies and meannesses on the part of the employers, who nevertheless continued, and were likely to continue, in a large measure masters and mistresses of the situation, so that the governesses were really waging a suicidal internecine war. Kirsten did not know whether to laugh or cry"], [259, "Seeking Work. 247 at the stories of atrocities committed by ladies and gentlemen upon their governesses, which were re peated to her with passionate conviction, and supported by masses of the most extraordinarily circumstantial, heterogeneous, self-contradictory evi dence. Snubbings, scoldings, starvings, slappings, and pinchings, all culminated in the cruel death, within a week of entering on her engagement, of a martyr-governess. On the whole, what Kirsten saw of a Home induced her to give up a project she had been driven to entertain. She had thought if she could find that she would be more in the way of getting an engagement ; if she could live with more rigor ous frugality in the establishment supplemented by charity for such as she was, she ought, so long as a fraction of her money was left, in justice to Mrs. Dawes, and as the last she could do for the children, to deny herself their company, betake herself, after dividing the small funds, to such an institution, and wait and see what would come of it. In the end Kirsten preferred to walk about and pretend she had been under the necessity of dining at a restaurant, when a roll bought at any baker's shop met the exigencies of her dinner-bell. There were hollows in the pale cheeks, and a famished look stealing into the reasonable, gentle eyes."], [260, "CHAPTER XVI. TRACKING BACK. AN ATONING BEQUEST. HAYTHORPE ONCE MORE.

What can it be about ? I see ; it is old Nash retiring from business, and offering the stock and goodwill of his bookseller's shop for sale. How well off he has been to carry on that quiet, pleasant business \u2014 inherited from his father, I have heard my father say \u2014 so long as he was able for work, and when he can manage it no longer to withdraw from it, with enough savings to keep him and old Mrs. Nash comfortably, I daresay. Some people"], [261, "Tracking Back. 249 have easy lives. What am I thinking of! Have I forgotten the deep waters the couple passed through \u2014 the son who went to the bad, of whom they knew nothing, the daughter who pined and died of consumption ! \" \"Still, I wish I could have bought that old business \" \u2014 about as possible a wish as Thackeray's imagining himself a mother-in-law was a probable conception. Kirsten resumed the thread of her cogitation. \"Yet I think I could have carried on the business with a little training, woman though I am. Why, for that matter, Mrs. Nash did quite as much in the shop as her husband. My father was as fond of a chat with the one as with the other. She was an equally good distributor of the news of the day and judge of paper and pencils, while she was great among the toy books and puzzles ; many a thimble I have bought from her. I suppose a thimble is regarded as feminine for a book ; but I wonder why bats and balls go along with literature in country booksellers' shops ? I daresay because in such regions reading is counted a pastime for all except a few professional men.\" \" Since I cannot attain to such a business by purchase,\" Kirsten still hammered at her subject, \" I wish there were societies for setting up women in trade, so that if they did their best and succeeded, they might make a provision for their declining years, and for such small families as they might leave behind them. If the Nashes had not given up so"], [262, "Her Gentle Deeds. 250 soon \u2014 doubtless for the reason that they have nobody to come after them, poor old souls \u2014 and if they had wanted a shopwoman instead of a shopman, they might have taken me and borne with my inexperi ence for a time. They had a great respect for my father and mother. I believe that would have gone some way. I venture to think also the odour in which my dear good people were held in the town in which we dwelt included me in some measure, and would not have been against customers to the shop.\" \" I trust there would have been no slight to beloved memories in an act which, when my father and mother came to regard it on all sides, in the light of the present day, they neither could nor would have disapproved,\" Kirsten grew grave over the fancy. \" They need not have minded my serving in a book seller's shop any more than my going out as a governess. They were both fond of what they used to call 'trafficking ' in books, newspapers, and sheets of music. The public would have stared, but soon grown reconciled to an inevitable fact. However, it would have been a great scandal to the Stewarts of Cope Hall, even though their mistress, the Duchess, had alighted from her carriage to grant me her patronage by buying a blotting-sheet from me. The Nashes were not hard people when they had to employ a lad, and I am sure Jim Punsford was not worth much to them ; he was always asking away to attend cricket-matches and choir practisings ; and"], [263, "Tracking Back. 251 what mistakes he made with the newspapers !

Life is so cheap and easy in Haythorpe, and the sweet country air would have been so good for the children. I wish I had a breath of it now.\" \"There!\" the girl wound up her day dream, \"I have sat dreaming a complete waking dream about the dear old place of which I have not heard a syllable for many a day. Is it unnatural and a shame in me not to have kept up a correspondence with Haythorpe ? I know when I left I promised to write to Alice and Dosia Jeffreys, and to Mary Hall and Mrs. Matthews and Sally White \u2014 even to old Mr. Lambert, but I seem to have been always pressed for time. It would have been hard to write what they would have been sorry to read. Besides, I did not wish to complain, or to solicit sympathy, least of all aid, from people not one of whom is rich. Am I proud and self-sufficing when it comes to that ?

This letter, which had been so long in reaching its destination, happened to be the most momentous letter which Kirsten Stewart ever got in the whole course of her life. A very strange thing had come to pass, though not more incredible than the discovery of a gold-field or a diamond-mine. Compensation had been made to her and to many others under the^most unforeseen circumstances and at the most unlooked-for time. A solitary old man, the owner of a large fortune which he did not very well know what to do with, had at one time enjoyed a perfectly innocent, while"], [265, "Tracking Back. 253 highly lucrative, connection with the unfortunate bank which had swallowed up Kirsten's little fortune. In course of time he had seen reason to disapprove of the management, though he had no actual cause to denounce it, and he had freed himself from all responsibility and interest in the matter. Conse quently the failure had not injured him, except by the shock he received from the ruin of others. He had been particularly struck with the number of women rendered destitute by the calamity. He was a just, kind-hearted man. In addition, he had an old-fashioned, manly notion that women, so long as they are not bred to business, or taught any available knowledge of the rise and fall of stocks, markets, &c, ought rather to be shielded and spared than pushed to the front and left among the principal scapegoats of wild speculation and reckless risk. It preyed upon the ex-director's mind that as this bank had been entirely managed or mismanaged by men, the women, who figured so largely among the sufferers from its transactions, might allege with reason hard treatment and scanty consideration at the hands of their brethren. He for one shrank from the stigma, and did not care that the plea should go up against him to a higher court of appeal than that of any earthly tribunal. His own safe, scot-free con dition affronted and stung him when he thought of aU these wrecked and forlorn women. He was moved to attempt an atonement in pro-"], [266, "Her Gentle Deeds. 254 posing a disposal of his property which had not hitherto occurred to him. He made a will, and died soon after the execution of the deed. He was found to have bequeathed his hundreds of thousands to a set of accountable trustees, who were bound, under a system of rewards and penalties, to see the large fortune divided in equal portions among the female shareholders of the defunct bank at the time of its failure. He caused it to be mentioned expressly that the gift was a small amends from a man for the wrong which these women had endured, from the cupidity and recklessness of the other men in whom they had reposed their trust. This disposition of worldly effects was so odd and unprecedented that a question of the perfect sanity of the testator had been raised by the most bitterly disappointed of the distant kin, who had pleased themselves with the idea of filling a dead man's shoes and inheriting his plums. But as beyond the deed not a trace of unsoundness of mind could be adduced, the doubt was being quickly laid when Mr. Stewart wrote to apprise Kirsten of her legacy. As far as he could make out from the state ment of effects and the list of bank shareholders, she would be entitled to about fifteen hundred pounds \u2014 a very respectable sum, capable of being put out to fair interest. Her correspondent begged to con gratulate Kirsten, and to request instructions and authority from her to act on her behalf."], [267, "Tracking Back. 255 The news took away Kirsten's breath. With all the precision and moderation of the last details, she could not allow herself to believe in them till she had heard again from Haythorpe. She had a horror of giving way to an abandonment of happiness which might have no sure foundation. She had a still greater reluctance to making the probability public till it was established beyond mistake. All this showed the very reverse traits to those of her fellow-countryman and former guardian, who wrote to her with considerable effusion. Kirsten had a naturally timid and not a sanguine temper. Her mind was well balanced. Her character had a strong tinge of the self-respecting reserve and delicate discreet pride, whether Scotch or not, of which she had recently accused herself. She wrote instantly to tell where she was and ask further information, but she did not say a word to any one, though she could not help feeling distrait and in the first stage of a fever of excitement. By a return post she had a letter of full confirmation from Mr. Stewart. In the interval since he had written his first letter the will was proved and ready to be administered. There was not the shadow of a difficulty. He had not time to discuss the surprise to him of her return to England, a fact she had barely mentioned. It was a fortunate coincidence. He begged her to come down at once to Haythorpe, where he and Mrs. Stewart would be much pleased"], [268, "Her Gentle Deeds. 256 to have her again for their guest. As an afterthought he wrote that the festivities on the Marquis's coming of age were to be held the following week. She ought not to miss the gay doings that were to enliven their quiet, old-fashioned town. They were sure to prove attractive to a young lady. His own girls had been full of them for the last month. At the same time, no holiday-making should interfere with business, and he must impress upon her that she ought to come down as soon as she got the letter, for certain forms had to be complied with in order to establish her claim. If she would forward a post-card mentioning the day and hour of her arrival, he would send to the train for her and her luggage, and Mrs. Stewart would have a bedroom ready for her. Kirsten sat staring before her for a moment. Then she silently thanked the Giver of all good things. Then she started up and kissed the children all round, considerably to their surprise and discomposure ; in deed, Sa was indignant, and struck out with her little fists, for Kirsten was not a woman who kissed in season and out of season ; she had not brought up her family on a regime of indiscriminate and perpetual caresses. Next Kirsten wondered if her father and mother knew. After that she went to tell Mrs. Dawes and Emily Anne. To Kirsten's communication that she had received a legacy, she added, as if by inspiration, the confident"], [269, "Tracking Back. 257 announcement of what she would do with it. \" I am going to buy the good-will of a bookseller's shop in my native town. Yes, I believe it is as safe an in vestment as anything in this unsafe world. But why should I call it unsafe when Providence sends such bounties ? There is a verse in the Psalms about David's never seeing the righteous forsaken nor their seed begging their bread \u2014 never for long, I am sure. There will be something for Beville and Katie and Sa to succeed to and improve upon. Beville may learn bookbinding and printing ; perhaps we shall rise into publishing.\" \" You, Mrs. Dawes, and Emily Anne,\" went on Kirsten, \" will come down and visit us whenever you can get away, to see how we are doing. Mr. Barnard is far too grand ; besides, he would wash his hands of communistic proceedings and mingle-mangle re lations. However, I shall write to him and tell him our troubles are over \u2014 he is entitled to that piece of information ; and I think, upon the whole, I shall not offer to repay that five-pound note. He would not like it sent back ; it would seem an intentional insult \u2014 an act of petty, unworthy pride. He gave and I took it freely.\" The steadiest head among the unsteady heads of girls was shaken for a moment. It quieted Kirsten to pass the Home that afternoon and know how many struggling, harassed women there had neither part nor lot in Kirsten's good s"], [270, "258 Her Gentle Deeds. fortune, beyond the sound of it, which in itself might be either refreshing or embittering as it was taken ; and a hasty invitation to an impromptu tea party of half-a-dozen guests \u2014 including the girl who had worked so hard as a telegraph clerk that she had in duced incurable headache, and the little Swiss girl who was literally without a friend in London. Mrs. Dawes and Emily Anne did not grudge the trouble of waiting on them. \" It is not the four-leaved shamrock, after all,\" Kirsten said to herself in a little regretful reaction. \" It seems as if I could not be grateful and enjoy my own blessed sense of relief for thinking of the unlisted burdens of others, as if there was not a Burden bearer, as if we were not in His merciful hands, with Him to apportion each load, and cause it to fall off the poor pilgrim's bowed shoulders at the best time.\" There was another discordant note in the harmony, besides the contradiction, that the letter which told Kirsten she and the children were suddenly lifted above pinching penury and threatened starvation had travelled thousands of miles before it found her, so that in the meantime she might have died of misery and starvation. As if to mock at her protracted speU of hope deferred, now that it was of little consequence to her, a letter arrived which, the week before, would have caused her to tremble with eager satisfaction and fresh hope. This letter was a tardy answer to the application for work which she had been making"], [271, "Tracking Back. 259 for many weeks. The reply was not in the nature either of a decoy-duck or a will-o'-the-wisp. The writer promised, in honest, sensible, kindly terms, all Kirsten had sought, and much she had not dared to expect. It showed her that an excellent situation for a daily governess, within an easy distance of Howard Street, had been, as it were, standing open for her the whole time \u2014 so near are we often to the goal of our desires without knowing it, or grasping the coveted boon. Must it be always thus in life ? Do the good tidings wander to other hemispheres before they reach their destination ? Will the ardently longed for reply come too late ? No, a thousand times no, Kirsten remained persuaded in the depths of her loyal, faithful heart. The harsh discrepancies, the perplexing incongruities, were only apparent and superficial. Beneath the continual jars and perpetual disappointments there lay a great peace and a final fulfilment. Her legacy had come to her at last. She had the comfort of passing on the vacant situation, which was no longer of moment to her, to another, to whom the opening was still like the bread of life. Three days later Kirsten was on the road to Hay thorpe, accompanied by her children. She had, as she thought, greatly improved on Mr. Stewart's plan. \" It was so like a man,\" she said to herself, with a little womanly conceit, \"to invite me on the spur of the moment to stay at Cope Hall. As if s 2"], [272, "260 Her Gentle Deeds. Mrs. Stewart will not have the house crammed in \u00abvery available corner, with their contribution of \u25a0company to the gala on the Marquis's coming of age !

I have not had an evening gown since I went into the mourning, which is getting very rusty ; yet I don't care to put it off, because it is worn for them, and I can never feel the same as I felt when I had not worn anything save coloured clothes. It will be ever so much more satisfactory, even without taking the children into consideration, that I should hire rooms \u2014 if possible, Sally White's. I was speculating miraculously upon them just before Mr. Stewart's letter arrived. I shall be able to try them, and see whether we can settle in them. It will do the poor dear bairns a world of good, and be such a treat to them to see an English country place before all the fine weather is gone.\" \" I expect Beville will cut his hands off if Tom White keep his tools at home.\" Kirsten tried to see ;the other side of her project. \" Katie will tread on Sally's toes with the little girl's directions and -orders. Old Sally used to be touchy when I plagued her, and apt to fall back on the affliction of the stitch in her side. But the last time I heard from her, al her own children had gone to school. She -will find Katie very helpful \u2014 far more so than I was at her age. Sally will soon come to take pride in Katie's smartness, as my mother's maid learnt to"], [273, "Tracking Back. 261 take pride in anything I could do. As for Sa, she will be everybody's pet, and make up for the mis demeanours of all the rest. Here she is, like a little jewel of an experienced traveller, neither crying nor poking her fingers where they should not be, nor asking to eat all the way and make herself ill, but sitting still and making her original observations like a small judge, only starting up to execute a frantic gesture in the line of the carriage windows, and to cry out, ' Kis, tows ! ' (cows), ' Kis, seep ! ' (sheep), which, considering that she has never seen the animals, except in the grotesque likenesses of then furnished by Katie and Beville and me, does credit to her discrimination.\" From the last infatuated observation and idiotic quotation it will be discovered that Kirsten was sinking deeper and deeper, until she was very far gone indeed in child-worship. The party approached Haythorpe in the mellow greyness of a late September afternoon. Kirsten was not at liberty to yield to the throng of old associations as the train swept through the peaceful green environs and drew up at the familiar platform ; to think how far she had gone and how much she had experienced since she was there last ; to remind herself of old Jacob who crossed the river with his staff, and recrossed it attended by a mighty band \u2014 wives and children and servants, lambs and asses,. herds and flocks ; to wonder which would be the"], [274, "262 Her Gentle Deeds. first well-known face, after that of the station-master, to greet her. She was plied by eager questions from the children about the place of which they had heard so often. \" Is that the steeple of the church you went to on Sundays when you were ever so much younger than we are ? Oh ? a wee, wee baby-girl, not much bigger than Sa, and you fell asleep and awoke crying, when your papa had to carry you out ? Can we see the river yet, Miss Stewart ? Shall we walk to Mrs. White's by the High Street, where you went to look at the shops before Christmas? \" Kirsten was like a young mother returning to her birthplace with her children, who conspired to sit upon her and pull her different ways, so that, constant as she was by nature, they would not leave her peace to return to the past. In truth, Kirsten, in her very appearance, was losing the abstracted and half- visionary or wholly free and careless air of the young unmarried woman ; she was rapidly maturing and looking older than she was, with another sort of abstraction than that of dreams \u2014 with the engrossment of every-day cares and troubles borne for others, sedateness of conscious abiding responsibility with its never failing crowd of obliga tions. It was the difference between the true matron, however young, and the maiden, however old. It is hardly necessary to record the fact that matronhood, with or without marriage, begins early for some, while maidenhood lingers long with others."], [275, "Tracking Back. 263 Something of pretty toying with the hours, of sweet unfulfilled promise, was lost to Kirsten in the premature bountifulness which she had gained. But is there any reality in a growth which costs nothing ? Is it not certain that only one important question belongs to all the various stages of our lives, whether the gain does not exceed the loss of what went before, and has passed away, over which we may spend a few pensive regrets ? Kirsten had been from the beginning in the position of many of the best girls among us. These are the eldest daughters, the queen-bees, according to Swedish phrase, in large families, or the only children of elderly parents. She had been pushed rapidly forward in her experience, and when she had been left alone in the world, she had taken a step on her own account and come through an ordeal which had intensified the process of speedy but sound ripening. She was hardly past her first girlhood, yet it must be con fessed that though perfectly neat, fair and sweet, she looked a little dowdy and old-fashioned as well as motherly, in her rusty mourning, hung about and clamoured to by the children on whom she was bestowing herself. She was like a girl who has long ceased to think first of herself, if she had ever so thought \u2014 who is, indeed, a girl no longer, but to all intents a matron \u2014 full of a matron's interests, serious even when humdrum, her solemn joys and tender sorrows."], [276, "264 Her Gentle Deeds. But surely this is promotion and not retrogression. The flower is better than the bud, and the fruit is of higher value than both \u2014 is the motive, when it comes to that, for which each in turn existed. We can comprehend this if we recognise that the loveliest attribute of true womanhood is its motherliness, that the typical woman is the blessed Virgin mother of all Christendom. But how many who do not know what ranges of character mean, prefer the lower to the higher, the imperfect germ to the complete finished product. A new surprise awaited Kirsten at the station. She had written to explain that she was bringing down some children who were in her charge, and that she meant to hire rooms from her mother's old servant, Sally White. But Mr. Stewart had persisted in doing her the honour of meeting her. His high grizzled head and his imposing Roman nose were the first friendly personal traits which attracted her eye, his affable \" Welcome back to Haythorpe, Miss Stewart,\" the first greeting which reached her ears. He had brought the roomy family waggonette, containing two of his daughters to bear Kirsten company, while there remained ample room for the children ; and the Whitechapel cart was in waiting for the luggage. He scouted the idea of Kirsten's going to Mrs. White's ; of course she was to come to Cope Hall. The house was full, but what of that ? It would stretch to afford a room for her \u2014 his charge,"], [277, "Tracking Back. 265 the daughter of his old friends, Captain and Mrs. Stewart, his clanswoman and country-woman to boot. As for the children, had she forgotten the old nurseries ? Baby \u2014 his baby \u2014 was still in part possession, but the entire suite would be all the better for being aired and re-occupied for a space. The proceeding was very kind, with a flavour of the exuberant Highland hospitality, but it was per plexing also. True, the Stewarts' weak point had never been lack of hospitality, and Kirsten had been their guest before, but not on such a pressing invita tion, while she had no reason to suppose she had risen in their estimation. It became out of her power to decline when Mr. Stewart put in a personal plea for her company, in a manner which felt overpowering from him, since he was autocratical and imperious in his deputy rule at Haythorpe. Kirsten had never known the couple who were in the same boat pull otherwise than har moniously ; still she doubted whether Mrs. Stewart would fully endorse the arrangement, though she might put the best face on it. It was a source of worry to Kirsten, breaking in on the comfort of her arrival, that she must prove an interloper, and that the children would be still more in the way, and would probably shock Mrs. Stewart by some of their irrepressible revelations and in appropriate achievements ; but there seemed no help for it, save to grin and submit."], [278, "266 Her Gentle Deeds. Mr. Stewart left the party the moment he had seen them into the waggonette, waving them away with a grand, eloquent parting, confessing that he had so much business on his hands he scarcely believed he should get out to Cope Hall to dinner, or even that night. The distressing intelligence was so far con firmed by the testimony of the two girls, who dwelt emphatically on papa's immense overwhelming load of work at this time, so that Kirsten became doubly and trebly struck by the compliment which had been paid to her, while she speculated for a moment if it could be the crushing weight of the festive prepara tions which caused Mr. Stewart to look so grey and worn in the middle of his suavity and activity. Kirsten had to make the acquaintance of these Cope Hall girls whom she had seen occasionally as children, but who had returned grown-up to Hay thorpe since she had left. Indeed, only the elder was a permanent institution as yet ; the younger had merely come over from Paris, and was having her holiday at the time of the Castle festivities. In the same way Kirsten was told that of the boys none save Malise had come home for good, though Donald and Jock had got leave from Sandhurst and Rugby. For the Marquis's coming of age was the thing which everybody about Haythorpe, especially everybody connected with Cope Hall and the Castle, had been looking forward to from the time the heir was born. Mrs. Stewart had been preserved from the plague"], [279, "Tracking Back. 267 of ordinary fine names in the family by the Highland pride which had clung tenaciously to family and Celtic designations. She had been rewarded by the approval ofthe Duchess, who had graciously told her retainer of the centuries-old Mileses and Joans, no less than the Marmadukes and Adelias which were perpetuated in her illustrious family. Therefore, the elder Miss Stewart was Ussie, the second Lauch lanina. Mrs. Stewart had been under the necessity of swallowing so much on the last score, that she was fain to fall back on the contraction Anina. Ussie was a handsome, striking-looking girl, with the father's nose distingue and her mother's originally dazzlingly fair complexion and bright restless blue eyes. She was dressed in a costly combination of dark blue cashmere, silk, and black lace, and had a velvet jacket for a wrap which might have suited the Duchess herself. So far as Kirsten could judge, during the first half-hour of their acquaintance, Ussie was an advanced version of the heads of the house \u2014 full of herself and her doings, instinct with self-importance, but not so fussy as her mother and less pompous than her father ; doing her boasting in a more correct and veiled manner, with better adaptation and in more correct style. Anina was not handsome. She was rather plain, with ill-proportioned features, and a thick, muddled complexion. She wore a rigorously plain schoolgirl costume of greys and browns \u2014 a sort of sackcloth"], [280, "Her Gentle Deeds. 268 and ashes, or chrysalis preparation for her future butterfly development, closely modelled on the pre sent condition of the Duchess's second daughter, Lady Mary. There was a degree of emphasis in the distinction between the toilette of the sisters that seemed to say, as in the case of the Duchess, Mrs. Stewart would not have two grown-up, un married daughters on her hands and mind at the same time. Neither would she imperil Ussie's prospects by withdrawing from her sole use in the meanwhile a fraction of the care and money to be lavished on her till the outlay received its due reward. But to the young a month is like a year, and a year is like a lifetime ; while the compulsory re straint which fell to Anina's lot at this date was the harder to bear since Ussie had not the advantage over her sister by more than two years. It would have required either much philosophy or much amiability for seventeen to submit gracefully to be totally eclipsed in order that nineteen might shine forth with unapproachable lustre. And Ussie had all the luck. Not only was she the eldest of three daughters ; the Marquis's coming of age had hap pened, as it were, in her honour, to make gay and splendid the year of her coming out. Anina could hope for no such commemoration of her entrance into the world, not though the Marquis married to oblige her, and brought home his bride to animate his father's chamberlain's daughter's first year in society."], [281, "Tracking Back. 269 To crown the mortification and supply its worst sting, Anina was sensible enough to be aware that she did not have the inheritance of good looks or womanly charm which might have neutralised \u2014 even triumphed over \u2014 the systematic repression from which she suffered. If Ussie had been in Anina's place it would have been different. She might still have had her \" innings,\" in the boys' words, and broken through and overcome the policy of holding back and keeping down. But Anina was plain, not pretty \u2014 so plain that she suspected her features and complexion were a source of chagrin to her father as well as to her mother. Mr. Stewart, in his own person, still showed the bones of a handsome man, was a little of an elderly coxcomb when he could find time, and would have chosen to possess food for vanity in all his children \u2014 in the looks and marriages of his daughters no less than in the brains and careers of his sons. Was it not part of the later blessing of the patriarch Job that his daughters were the fairest in the land, doubtless sought eagerly in marriage by the most flourishing Arab sheikhs. As for Mr. Stewart, his aspirations were those of Mr. Barnard on a lower, perhaps less justifiable scale. To sum up the trial for a girl, Anina's misfortune in the colour of her cheeks and the shape of her nose, and in a certain bluntness and abruptness of manner peculiar to her, was apt to serve as a butt for the thoughtless wit of her elder sister and younger"], [282, "Her Gentle Deeds. 270 brothers, from which the special favour entertained for her by her elder brother Malise was not able to protect her. The result presented Anina Stewart a sharp tongued, discontented-looking girl, by many degrees the least agreeable of the Cope Hall Stewarts whom Kirsten had known. From the girls' conversation, Kirsten learnt that the house was as full asjshe had anticipated, with the old circle of second-rate, somewhat dilapidated gentry and military and naval men \u2014 some of whom were old enough to have been in the same regiment as the Duke, or to have sailed in the ship with his brother, the Lord High Admiral. There was also the refuse of the Castle guests crowded out by the unusual abundance of choice company. It was evident that Ussie cherished fond expectations from these wanderers out of a higher sphere, though she did not say so exactly. She sketched her programme cautiously. \" It will be nice to have Sir Arthur and Lady Beauchamp with us. I was introduced to her at Colonel Clive's tennis party, and she talked a little of China. We shall be able to hear more of it, which will be very interesting, as Donald's regiment \u2014 the one he is likely to be appointed to \u2014 is on active service there.\" \" We shall not be much the better of what Lady Beauchamp will tell us,\" said Anina superciliously ; \" she is about as intelligible and entertaining as a"], [283, "Tracking Back. 271 mandarin who does not know the English language ; not that it will at all matter, for Donald has not got his regiment yet, and he is as likely to be sent to Hudson's Bay or Botany Bay, or St. Neot's or St. Ives, as to China.\" \"Oh, do they really eat little dogs in China?\" interjected Katie, in accents of tragic excitement. \" More frequently little girls,\" Anina dismissed the question brusquely. \" Mr. Annesley will be the greatest acquisition in helping us to get over the intervals between the Castle dinners and balls,\" Ussie continued to predict blandly, too well satisfied to be disturbed by her sister's objections. \" He has a fine tenor voice, and is always willing to sing a second. I heard him at the Castle last Christmas. He makes up capitally for any leading part in theatricals. No one is a better partner for the cotillon.\" \" As if such an accomplished gentleman would perform for the benefit of any set of people beyond the Castle precincts ! \" suggested Anina incredulously. But Ussie was invulnerable in her happiness. \" You will hear and see \u2014 oh, no, I forgot, you will be with the other children, Anina. But, perhaps, even the children may get a glimpse of what is going on, if there be room, and if the little people have not crumpled their frocks, and can be depended upon to behave prettily. You will be sure to hear and see, Miss Stewart. By the way, you and I are doubles."], [284, "Her Gentle Deeds. 272 There will be two Miss Stewarts. We must take care there are no stupid mistakes,\" with a shade of coquettish affectation. \" I do not think there is any danger,\" said Kirsten, amused by the idea of being confounded in her domestic character, and her position of nobody at Cope Hall, with the eldest daughter of the house, the very elegant, animated figure before her. \" Well, I don't suppose you are my style,\" ad mitted Ussie, composedly and carelessly. \" I can dance Jim Crow,\" suddenly volunteered Beville, as he began to experience his share of Katie's disgust at finding himself kept so long out of the con versation. \" One of the errand fellows taught it to me.\" \"What a comical child!\" exclaimed Ussie, a little doubtfully. \" What does he mean ? Oh ! don't tell him to be quiet. He reminds me of little Lord Hugo, who picked up one of the beater's songs, and sings it sometimes to his grace after luncheon.\" \" I should just like to know Lord Hugo. Is he a rum codger, too? \" inquired Beville, with interest. Both Ussie and Anina stared, for once in concert, while Beville's desire for acquaintance with the youngest hope of the ducal house did not meet with any encouragement."], [285, "CHAPTER XVII CONTRASTS.

Kirsten had arrived at Cope Hall, and been re ceived with laborious empressement, extending to hand-pressing and a light dab of a kiss from Mrs. Stewart. The children were safely deposited in the nurseries, which, as Cope Hall aimed at being a great country house, were sufficiently remote and inaccessible. The instalment was made amidst much juvenile indignation, which was not even sup pressed where Sa was concerned, but made itself heard in a howl of amazement and displeasure. The separation, after the close union, even smote Kirsten to the heart, but she had the compensation of knowing that her adopted family were safe and well-treated in all essentials, while they ware out of T"], [286, "Her Gentle Deeds. 274 the way of offending any other feeling save the sensi tive-enough organs of the mannerly nurse who pre sided over this branch of the establishment, and the obtuse faculties of the youngest child of the Cope Hall Stewarts. This was a girl of eleven years, who had to remain very much of an infant in order to preserve the sliding scale of precedence and expense, which included the fallacy of Anina's pupilage. Barbara or Baby Stewart was doomed to wear her hair in tails hanging down the back of the shortest of frocks and pinafores. She was condemned to play with dolls, after she had ceased to be able to make believe in them. She had a nurse who could play the part of nursery governess instead of a regular teacher. Baby was a very dull child, both by nature and system, though, happily, she did not threaten to grow up plain like Anina. Katie Owen's eyes were a sight to behold as she contemplated this specimen of retarded development in a child who did not speak unless she was spoken to, and seemed resigned to begin life by finding herself shelved. Kirsten had emerged so lately from social straits that she could hardly reconcile herself to sitting down and taking her ease among idle, disengaged people, who were not each in hot pursuit of an opportunity for earning his or her daily bread. She caught herself, as she sat down at the luxuriantly supplied table, starting back as at an instance 'of heinousjextravagance, and beginning to mete out"], [287, "Contrasts. 275 the smallest portions to herself in painful antici pation of coming to want at no distant day. She hoped the children in the upper regions were not immortalizing themselves and endangering their lives by gastronomic feats. Poor little beings ! they had fared plainly and sparingly for many weeks, and if all these grown-up people put the utmost value on food and drink, what could be looked for from mites like Katie and Beville and Sa? The glitter of lights and flowers belonging to a festive table and a festive company, to which Kirsten had been long unaccustomed, dazzled her. The gay ring of the voices overpowered her. The experience she had recently undergone caused her to feel out of place there \u2014 an interloper, if not an impostor. She was inclined to shrink out of sight and keep in a corner. Mrs. Stewart's olive satin and gold ornaments looked a dress for a queen. Ussie was like a princess royal in her wavy white cashmere with its long soft folds, and her coral collar and bracelets ; yet mother and daughter were only in demi-toilette. Kirsten did not meet old friends \u2014 whatever might be said of old acquaintances \u2014 at Cope Hall. The sets in which the two families of Stewarts had moved were as distinct and apart as a country neighbour hood would permit. Kirsten slipped, alike by fate and choice, into the background in the Cope Hall drawing-room. She was the equal of most of the people she met there, by birth and education. She T 2"], [288, "276 Her Gentle Deeds. was immeasurably the superior of most in certain notable attributes ; but though she knew several as they knew her, by name and exchange of bows and slight greetings, she had little in common with these shady younger sons, clerical dandies, languid, all informed Government clerks, bluff and jaunty half pay officers, limited ambitious squires with their woman-kind. She found her place intuitively among the quietest, not of the young people, but of the matrons, and talked to them a little of children. Mr. Stewart found her out when he joined the party at last, in spite of his prognostications. He came over and discussed business with her in her corner, as he had promised in one of his letters that pleasure should not interfere with business. But he scouted the notion of her buying old Nash's business. \" A most preposterous fancy, not to be entertained seriously for a moment. What could she know of business ? she would throw away in a year what, carefully nursed and managed, might serve as a small provision for life. As to the little Owens \u2014 so far as he could gather from what she told him, she had been very good, amazingly good ; but whoever heard of a young lady, who had not too much for her own use, adopting a child ? A child ! \u2014 three children ! It was incredible \u2014 monstrous ! She must be stopped by force, if necessary, in her own interest. The man Owen had been a mean scoundrel. Of course the children could not help"], [289, "Contrasts. 277 that, and he himself would see what could be done for the poor little creatures. He would speak to her Grace when the present hubbub was over, and he could hit on a propitious moment. There were public charities. The boy might get among the Bluecoats, where not merely a maintenance, but an education which Mr. Stewart might have coveted for his own sons, would be secured to the lad ; and the girls might be disposed of elsewhere. But they could not be allowed to hang like a millstone round Kirsten Stewart's neck, and spoil her life. He should be unworthy of the trust which her good father had put in him if he suffered it, now that he was honoured with her confidence and acquainted with the particulars, after she had empowered him to secure the compensation for her loss with the bank, which had so fortunately fallen to her share. It was enough to prove a tidy little income and dowry for her when the last should be wanted, which he had no doubt would be soon.\" Kirsten felt vexed and annoyed. Mr. Stewart might only be talking reasonably to her. She was certainly indebted to him for sparing a quarter of an hour of his precious time to consider her affairs. He could not tell what the Owens had become to her, so that his speaking of them like common objects of charity, and his denouncing their father \u2014 as, without question, Mr. Owen deserved to be denounced \u2014 made her cheeks burn and filled her with mortifi-"], [290, "278 Her Gentle Deeds. cation and distress, as if he had been attacking herself through her near kindred. She did not quite see that Mr. Stewart's former guardianship warran ted him in his present assumption of authority over her and her friends. He was kind, of course \u2014 even markedly kind \u2014 seeking to bring her forward. It was not his fault that she drew back. Absurd as it sounded, it actually looked as if he felt proud to have her under his roof again, and was disposed to sport and show off their relations to each other. Kirsten was not a suspicious woman. She could not have the most distant conception of the labyrinths of vanity, sanguineness, unconfessed apprehension, clutching at last straws, which helped this result. But she was a modest, sensible woman, and she was forced to remark the phenomenon with mingled astonishment and discomfiture. Another and more agreeable shock, of the nature of a curious coincidence, was in store for Kirsten this evening. She had heard more than one allusion to the fact that Malise Stewart, the eldest son, had succeeded old Dr. Harrison in his medical practice at Haythorpe, under the Duke's assured patronage. She had listened to various lamentations over the young doctor's being detained by a bad case, several miles off, till late on the evening of her arrival. But she had received no cause to put two ends of her ex perience together, or had any ground for connecting Dr. Malise Stewart with the doctor at No. 11,"], [291, "Contrasts 279 Howard Street \u2014 the doctor who had sent her to the hospital, called her to order when she was behaving foolishly there, and gone on her errand to number nine. Notwithstanding, when the hour and the moment came, and the eldest son of her host appeared in his father's drawing-room, though he was in evening dress and had dropped his pro fessional attitude, Kirsten was not so devoid of individuality as to fail to identify the yellow hair and the faint reflection of the Highland accent \u2014 her own mother tongue \u2014 on his lips. Well, what did it matter ? She sought to still a natural throb of the heart at the discovery. She had once thought it might be pleasant to know her autocratic young doctor under more favourable auspices. As for the past, she had nothing to con ceal, though some of the matter-of-fact ladies and gentlemen around her, even the friendliest matron who had somehow been conscious of a bond of union between them, and had stalked to Kirsten \u2014 might leap up in their chairs at the sensational intelligence that the young lady in the black silk, whose hair did not form either a mane or a crop, had been a patient in a public hospital. If she had been a nurse, it would have been a totally different matter, but to consent, for any reason under the sun, to be among the ruck of patients, submitting to their treatment, was quite too, too.\" When Malise Stewart, in the course of his"], [292, "280 Her Gentle Deeds. \u25a0courteous greetings, came up to Kirsten, he stopped short, taken aback, uncertain, confounded. \" It is Miss Stewart, Malise, Captain Stewart's daughter ; don't you recollect ? \" cried his mother. \" I did not think it necessary to introduce you, but now, when I come to consider, you may not have met since you were children, if then. Will you for give me ? Shall I go through the form now ? \" \" There is no occasion, mother,\" said Malise quickly. \" Miss Stewart, I am sure we have met before,\" he said, pointedly and smilingly; but he did not enter into details. It was clear he did not in- tend to take the others into his confidence. It did not follow that the incident made no impression upon him. His colour deepened and his eyes sparkled, while he addressed Kirsten with a deferential, respectful softness, which was as honour- able to him as it must have been agreeable to her. He was soon drawn away from her, however, not only by the exigencies of his position as chief aide to his father and mother in entertaining their guests and their master's, the Duke's, but, by the lively attractions of the young people to whom Kirsten, .for the present at least, had ceased to belong. There were several girls of Ussie's age, and a still larger sprinkling of young men in the room. Whether or not Lady Beauchamp had enlivened the neighbours by doing justice to China, Mr. Annesley had been upon honour, and had sung and danced for"], [293, "Contrasts. 281 his entertainment. A good deal of music and a little dancing had been accomplished ; and there was no end of pleasant chat \u2014 not so much witty as bright with the sparkle of youth in its light-heartedness and sunshine. Zest was lent to each discussion by the eager anti cipation of the Castle festivities, which were to begin properly with a great dinner and ball on the following evening, to be followed by other dinners and balls, a football match, concerts, the opening of a Mechanics' Institute, Sec, extending over the better part of a week, and electrifying drowsy Haythorpe till the gala was over. The young people in the circle were tolerably well known to each other. Where they were not well known they were still perfectly au fait, in the freemasonry of their years, where each other's tastes and habits were concerned. Malise Stewart was not out of the circle or unlike his kind. He was a capital fellow, and was claimed as a highly available ally and favourite. Besides, he was on his own ground, where he was not only at home, but where it was incumbent on him to exert himself for the public good. Duty and inclination were at one. He was naturally and happily absorbed in the moving groups congregated now about the piano, now about one of the windows, now in the corridor. The younger sons of the house were ordinary enough, well-looking, well-bred lads, except for a"], [294, "Her Gentle Deeds. 282 dash of self-consequence and self-consciousness, which left a doubt whether, in the family distribution of brains, Donald and Jock Stewart had inherited as fair a share as had fallen to the lot of Malise and Anina. These representatives of Sandhurst and Rugby ap peared to have no recollection of Kirsten's existence, unless when their father or mother prompted them. She on her part was not moved to make any individual claim to their acquaintance. Once or twice Malise Stewart paused in his attend ance on the girls in white, or faintest blue, or tender est pink, or, for a change, dead gold, or cardinal red, with fragrant perfumed flowers in their hair and at their throats, and shining jewels at their wrists and in their ears ; graceful, joyous figures, with tripping feet and laughing lips, fit accompaniments to the scene ; stars of his hemisphere innocently and in evitably calculated to draw him within their influence. Yet his glance strayed occasionally, with a wistful, regretful remembrance, to the girl in black, sitting well enough pleased, as if she had found her level and knew it among the older people, not even the frisky matrons, but the slow specimens. She was a hum drum figure to contemplate, decidedly dull, probably a little stupid. She had complied with the fashion of wearing a flower in her hair, but as she had not given elaborate study to the subject, and had even been guilty of thinking of something else when she stuck it in, it must be confessed that the arrangement"], [295, "Contrasts. 283 was not eminently successful. She had not caught the prevailing style \u2014 whether it were that of a bud behind the ear, or a tendril down one shoulder, or a coronet of blossoms. The white camellia she had chosen was heavy and too colourless for her com plexion, while its cold snowiness of tint failed to relieve the sombreness of her black silk gown. To appreciate Kirsten's charm you must come near her, gaze on her brow, look into her eyes, hang on her lips ; but seen at a little distance one was apt to come to the conclusion that she might be a good girl, even a heroic girl, but a belle ! \u2014 no ; and the young doctor had a small weakness for belles, as why should he not, if belles meant what was young, sweet, and fair, set off by white satin and pearls, maidenhair fern, and the little scarlet fruit of the barberry, without one shadow to darken the picture ? Many people are like Queen Elizabeth in preferring it so. They do not desire a sobering influence or a hoarse echo from the struggling, suffering world to break what is not so much the highest idealism as the glamour of fairyland. Malise did tear himself from his surroundings, so far as to have eyes and mind to spare now and then. He wondered why he had thought so much of Kirsten Stewart when he only knew her to be a lady reduced to take refuge in an hospital. Why he had been so charmed with her as to consider her more than pretty. And now, when he had stumbled upon her,"], [296, "284 Her Gentle Deeds. where he had least expected to find her, in his mother's drawing-room, he was not enchanted, but on the road to be disillusioned. He supposed it was always so when a fellow happened to be a trifle romantic \u2014 if he were romantic. Ussie had the cool ness to accuse him of being so, while certainly he could not return the reproach, for a more wide-awake, matter-of-fact piece of feminine goods, than Ussie, he could not imagine. Well, his romance did not extend to preferring a beggar-maid. What a shame to in dicate old Captain Stewart's daughter by such a title to Miss Monckton, or Miss Maud Gresham, or even the Latouche girls, Kate and little Clara. Miss Stewart looked tame and dowdy, if she could not be said to be in rags and tatters. Malise had the grace to ask Kirsten to dance, how ever, but after she told him she had not danced for a long time, and did not feel equal to round dances \u2014 one of which was forming when he spoke \u2014 he yielded to her objections without a demur. The next square dance found his mother beckoning to him and assign ing him a partner ; strange to say, he did not quarrel with her selection, which fell not on Kirsten, but on Miss Monckton, old General Monckton's stately, handsome young niece and heiress. Kirsten was impressed almost painfully this even ing by Mrs. Stewart's sedulous, daring, well-nigh transparent man\u0153uvres to match her eldest son and daughter with the best partners in the room. She"], [297, "Contrasts. 285 was so bent on Malise's taking in Miss Monckton to supper, and Ussie's singing again and again with Mr. Annesley, that Kirsten feared everybody must notice it. She had always known Mrs. Stewart to be greatly self-seeking \u2014 in one degree of removal \u2014 for her family's sake instead of her own, but never so barefacedly as that, for the lady had also been a woman of the world, priding herself on her unim peachable good breeding. But the present arrange ments were in glaringly bad taste and form. Malise ought to have escorted one of the fuming dowagers. Some of the indignant girls should have sung at least half as often as Ussie, whose performance had no remarkable merit to thrust it to the front. It seemed as if Mrs. Stewart were getting reckless. Yet Malise and Miss Ussie were both young, with no particular call for their being early settled in life. Notwithstanding this immunity, Mrs. Stewart showed herself restless and uneasy, and immediately put in her ill-advised oar the moment her son and daughter were carried away from the partners she had destined for them. The post of chamberlain, and chamberlainess, to a great duke could not be a sinecure or conducive to bodily and mental well-being. Mrs. Stewart was thinner than Kirsten had ever seen her. She was positively worn to the bone, with a harassed look, from the little furrows creasing the still white fore head, and a peculiar sharpness in the set of the"], [298, "Her Gentle Deeds. 286 tightly closed mouth. Prosperity had dealt even more unkind with Mr. and Mrs. Stewart than adver sity had treated Kirsten. She was thin also, no doubt, and pale, but in spite of her matured and sober aspect, she still looked, not only as if gladness as well as trouble had come to her, but as if there had been no abiding thorn in her pillow, no sword of Damocles suspended over her head. The expression, at once wary and weary, of having pulled themselves together and collected all their energies by a supreme effort, which belongs to people who look out from behind a mask, keep up appearances, and know not what a day or an hour may bring forth, was entirely absent from Kirsten's slightly wasted and wan young face. Mr. Stewart followed his wife's suit so far as abetting her under plausible pretexts, in throwing Malise and Ussie into conspicuous associations with the great eligibles of the room. As if to reward him for the concession she accepted his cue, and was pointedly attentive to Kirsten. The mistress of the house came two or three times and sat down in a half-absent-minded manner and tried to draw out her least obtrusive, most obscure guest. She even intermitted her design that Malise should concen trate his slightly flighty attentions on Miss Monckton, in order to seek to make him stand up in a quadrille with Kirsten. Mrs. Stewart's notice of Kirsten, like that of her"], [299, "Contrasts. 287 husband, was so remarkable in the circumstances, that other people began to observe it and to be affected by it. Kirsten was likely to have more attention paid to her in the end than she cared for. It startled and disturbed her. Who or what was she that she should be distinguished by her host and hostess in a manner which the rest of the company soon commenced to copy curiously ? Mr. and Mrs. Stewart had not displayed their regard in this way on the occasion of her former visit, though to be sure she was in her first mourning, disliking very much to be in company, staying a good deal in her own room. Did they wish to make a lion of her in accordance with her story, and what Mr. Stewart had thought fit to call her amazing goodness ? Was this their mode of helping her and the children ? It was not out of keeping with one side of the High land character in its passion for stage effect and its effusiveness. But she should detest the demonstra tion of all things. If she could believe it possible, she would insist on accomplishing a retreat, masterly or unmasterly. She would seek some other quarters, with Mrs. White or any quiet, humble person. Kirsten would not consent to become a gazing stock. She would not let Katie and Beville and Sa, in their simplicity and unconsciousness, be made public shows, because their father had practised an imposture on her, and she had declined to forsake the children. She was there to protect them from"], [300, "Her Gentle Deeds. 288 the mistaken kindness, which would really be injury and insult. She had a right to do what she liked with the God-send which the benefactor of the women ruined by a bank-failure had put into her hands. Kirsten was rendered unhappy, she could bareby compose herself to admit that the party was in other respects pretty and pleasant \u2014 a little tiresome to her, but that was doubtless because she had got quite out of the way of such parties. It was fortunate that she had no particular inclination to have any thing more to do with them, that she had never been specially cut out for them, since they were totally incompatible with what she had undertaken. Or was she like the fox with the unattainable grapes, disposed to persuade herself that grapes were not made to her taste, that she had never cared greatly for them ? All the same, she must take note of all the fine dresses and dishes, on account of Katie, who had an unappeasable appetite for such details, to comfort the little girl for her banishment."], [301, "CHAPTER XVIII. BUSY MORNINGS AND GAY EVENINGS, WITH THEIR INTERRUPTIONS. IRSTEN'S life for the next few days was divided into two distinct and contrasted portions. The other members of the circle had numerous pressing engagements at this time, and she found herself at liberty to spend her mornings as she liked. She could walk with the elder children to Haythorpe and take them to see old places and old friends again. But just as on her arrival, she found herself distracted from dweUing on former claims by the strong appropriation of later ties. Even the door of her father's house as it stood closed to her, and the windows from which strange faces were looking out, did not make the mournful impression on her she had counted on, because she was summoned by the children to tell which was the window of her little room, and Beville, and even the decorous Katie, would run up the flight of steps merely to run down them again, as Miss Stewart had once run. Kirsten did not forget, would never forget ; but it is only in Paradise that there will be full room for ti"], [302, "Her Gentle Deeds. 290 the old and the new, with no clashing claims, only in eternity that there will be leisure to recall and sound over again every strong, tender chord of our being which has made us what we are. Still Kirsten did not shrink from taking Katie and Beville to the quiet corner of the churchyard, to stand before the two graves, mounds which had broken her heart afresh to leave behind her, with a little hand clasped in her own on each side. Katie's glib tongue was still. Beville forgot to caper. \" When I see them again,\" said Kirsten softly, \" I shall say, ' Here am I, my father and mother, with the children God has given me.' \" The children ratified the compact with a faint dawning of comprehension ; acting on a common impulse, they pressed up to her and sought to draw her down to kiss her. \" You are our own Miss Stewart,\" whispered Katie. \" And nobody else has anything to do either with you or with us,\" asserted Beville roundly. \" I shall try and mind what you say, if Katie will help me, and when I am a man I will knock down every other man that looks at you.\" The Stewarts of Cope Hall, though they were always looked up to and deferred to in a way as wielding the Duke's authority, had never, as a family, been greatly liked in Haythorpe. Their nationality had little to do with this. They had filled the seat between stools, which, whatever the occupants may think, is no more a graceful than it is a safe seat."], [303, "Busy Mornings and Gay Evenings. 2gi They had neither been the great nor the small. They had only possessed a reflection of greatness, which, though it had taken in themselves, had not deceived their neighbours. No doubt the Stewarts had their good qualities, but in the seniors their virtues were warped and tarnished by the propensity to lord it over their fellows, and the necessity for self-assertion in what was at the best a factitious lordliness, while borrowed plumes never cease to be regarded with a mixture of scorn and aversion. The Stewarts must either have been very unaffected and unassuming, or double-dyed hypocrites, to escape altogether the penalty of a false position. Malise was the exception to the rule, his personal popularity burst through the shadow thrown upon it. However, Kirsten had not guessed till on this return to Haythorpe^how universal was the smoulder ing distrust and antagonism excited by the Duke's chamberlain and his wife with their proceedings in toto. Even Sally White had her small stone to fling at these obnoxious objects. Sally's first cry on seeing her young mistress again had been an affectionate reminiscence \u2014 \" Oh ! the old master and mistress, Miss Kirsten,\" exclaimed the former retainer, covering her eyes for a second as from too vivid a vision ofthe spare, cheery Captain, and his stout, equally cheery wife. Then the matron, in her hearty satisfaction at greeting Kirsten and welcoming her to Sally's house, u 2"], [304, "Her Gentle Deeds. 292 was ready to receive a batch of children into her spotless smart apartments. But with the next breath she flung her stone \u2014 \" You'll be the first, miss, as has come out of Cope Hall that has done aught for many a day in the interests of the town by taking my rooms. Not a grain of their custom do them 'alf and-'alf folks give, either in the matter of chairs and tables, or groceries or haberdashery, though the Dook when he is at 'ome will order a chaise along. from White's people, and the Duchess will buy her calicots, if not her silks, at Morris's.

Folk do say it is not without a ' because ' the Cope Hall gentry have entirely deserted the town in the line of buying and selling, and must get even their servants' tea and sugar and soap and sodar sent down in boxes from them stores in the big towns. If you will be lieve me, Miss Kirsten, there's no end of tales behind backs of long-standing accounts run up here and there and everywhere, at the nurseryman's, with old Mrs. Blane that went out to cook on a pinch, and Becky Frome as did extra laundry work, and not a penny paid up except to the butcher and baker, and no pressing for payment to be ventured on with the Dook behind the defaulters. It is a shame to use such a screen, so it is.\" \" So it is, Sally, if it be true, which very likely it"], [305, "Busy Mornings and Gay Evenings. 2g3 is not, for you and I know of old what mountains the Haythorpe people \u2014 honest, kind people, the more's the pity that they will allow their tongues such license \u2014 rear out of mole-hills ; anyway, luckily it is no business of yours and mine.\" \" No more it is, miss,\" owned Sally, agreeing to stand corrected ; \" and it was ill-polite of me to mention it to you, and they of Scotch descent, like yourself, and the old Captain's friends ; leastways he trusted the gentleman more, maybe, than was worldly wise, and you living in their house. But you know I were always given to speak my mind sharp and hot, so that my mistress, your lady mother, she did say, after the fashion of her country, ' Sally, you have a tongue that would clip clouts.' \" Kirsten laughed with the moisture in her eyes at the old familiar phrase. \" Listen, Katie, and take warning,\" she said. \" Nay, but it were a word of warning I was minded to give you,\" interposed the irrepressible Sally. \" His family's bad repute will not be a spoke in the wheel of the young spark of a doctor, for whom many has a favour since he has come down to take up the practice of the old doctor, not though he do be called to the Castle to the housekeeper's gout, or an ache in her Grace's little finger.

Kirsten received a deeper impression from a confidence, not dissimilar in purport, bestowed on her by Dr. Lambert, the old clergyman. \" The Stewarts of Cope Hall are certainly not very prudent or far-seeing people, my dear, though they have been looking out for themselves ever since I knew them. There is a talk that in launching their chUdren on the world the couple have also been launching into expenses rather wildly of late. I cannot tell the amount of truth in the report, but I suspect it is not without foundation. Young Malise may do well enough ; he is certainly a nice fellow, with no want of what we old-fashioned people call ' parts.' He has entered on a good country practice under the next thing to royal auspices. The eldest girl is handsome, but rather pronounced. I have more doubts whether she will marry well. Stewart and his wife, in their rage for the upper ten, keep too many half-pace, more or less broken-down hangers-on of the Duke's about them. I am saying this plainly in confidence to you, Kirsten, because I am a little sorry you have fallen among the set, though Captain Stewart had faith in his namesake, I do not go so far as to say it was misplaced both as a countryman and a business man.\""], [307, "Busy Mornings and Gay Evenings. 2g5 To Kirsten's great relief and encouragement, when she laid before Dr. Lambert her proposal of making an offer to Mr. Nash for his business, conditional on his retaining it till she had received some training, and seen if she were fit for the duties, the old clergy man, in place of administering a douche of cold water, as Mr. Stewart had done, was inclined to take the scheme into favour, and find in it a welcome solution for an awkward difficulty and danger he had been forced to apprehend on her account. He was a lively, liberal man for his years, not ossified by prece dents so as to be incapable of receiving new ideas. \" It might answer, it might answer very fairly,\" he said, shutting one eye behind his spectacles, and rubbing together the hands clasped behind his back. \" You have a good head, and are as steady as a rock, like the stock you come of, child. You could have a strong porter for heavy work. Look down upon you ? Nobody worth a regret would be such an idiot. There would be risk \u2014 where is there not risk when anything worth doing is to be done ? The stock must be taken, and the value of that and of the custom settled by professional third parties. Upon my word, I don't think there would be great risk \u2014 as little as you could hope for in any enterprise, since I have heard of no opposition as yet, and you have a connection secured to you by former residence in the town. \" Why, you are a burgess's daughter, Kirsten,\""], [308, "296 Her Gentle Deeds. Dr. Lambert recalled the next moment. \" I re member your father's having the freedom to buy and sell in the burgh presented to him, as a reward for his exertions in procuring evidence to go before a com mission, and get a bill passed to bring water into the town, a measure which, between ourselves, was un derstood to be in opposition to his Grace's will, in the first place \u2014 no, the Duke will not remember it now ; he is too big a man to be capable of shabby vin dictiveness, though he has his faults like the rest of us. He was always on fairly good terms with your father, and expressed his regret, the first time I saw him afterwards, that he had not been at the Castle, so that he might have attended the funeral. Don't tell me it is nothing to be a burgess's daughter, even in these degenerate days ! You would be content with moderate profits, and not be in a haste to grow rich. You would not be beguiled into mad specula tions like some friends of ours in their family expenses. I am persuaded there would be less risk for you in keeping shop than in buying some flash company or bank shares, that favourite resource of ignorant, un businesslike men and women \u2014 God help them ! \u2014 as experience has proved, while there is not always a champion to redress their wrongs. Ay, there might even be less risk than in entering on a governess's situation sometimes \u2014 eh, Kirsten ? \" There, I am not going to blame you for not re nouncing the children cast upon you \u2014 as I bear my"], [309, "Busy Mornings and Gay Evenings, zgj Master's commission, I dare not,\" exclaimed the old man\u2014\" and I am not going to praise you, for if the step was not wrong it is beyond praise. But with regard to the children, I may say that an honest trade, which they have been taught to carry out, ought to be a mighty deal better thing for them than even a moderate inheritance, which they do not know what to do with. It will take the money out of other people's hands, and it may keep some folk from temptation. It is a very sensible notion to come from a young lady, for which you deserve much credit, my dear. It should not be lost sight of for a day, since one never knows how soon other bidders for the business may crop up. Steps ought to be taken immediately to test the feasibility of the plan. If you like, I shall put on my hat, and just step with you round to Nash's, and ask a few words with him in private, to see what he thinks of it all. That will be striking when the iron is hot.\" Kirsten was only too thankful for the support thus vouchsafed, and she had no doubt that she owed in part to the countenance of Dr. Lambert, who was much respected in the town for his homely sagacity no less than his Christian benevolence, the fact that Mr. Nash, a quiet, cautious, but not ungenerous man, took kindly to the suggestion from the first, and promised to give it his best consideration. So far Kirsten had held herself at liberty to act on her own responsibility, but she felt sensible, also,"], [310, "298 Her Gentle Deeds. that she ought to tell Mr. Stewart what she had done. It was due to him that she should go noTarther with out his knowledge, if not his concurrence. Somehow she was almost afraid to approach the subject. It was a relief to her when he received her com munication with nothing worse than a little coolness and stiffness, which gradually warmed and melted into his ordinary august friendliness. He had either let his strong objections slip from him in the course of the discussion, or he could not trouble himself to recall them in the hurry of much more pressing and important concerns. Among other obligations, she understood he was completing elaborate estimates of the Duke's vast property and statements of his affairs, to be laid before the Marquis on his coming of age. She was indebted to Mr. Stewart for wasting a moment's thought upon her small venture. \" Certainly, if you have set your heart upon being a tradeswoman, Miss Stewart, there is nothing to prevent it. I can only wish you success, and promise you my slender custom ; and, what is of more con sequence, that of the family at the Castle, for such books and stationery as they require down here. His Grace is always anxious to help the industrious ofthe town ; and, what is more, he can afford it, while the Duchess does not fail him in this respect. Lam bert is no fool though he is a parson, and I am willing to allow you credit for knowing what you are about. \"Of course, every care must be taken that Nash"], [311, "Busy Mornings and Gay Evenings. 2gg does not get advantage out of you in the transfer, should it come to that,\" Mr. Stewart took the trouble to explain. \" I do not mean that he would do so grossly, or even knowingly, but sellers and buyers are inevitably biassed by their interests. However, all that may be suffered to lie by for the present, I hope. You will do me a favour if you will not move farther in the matter, or make it more public, I need not say, till I am at leisure to look into it on your behalf. It is enough that Nash is acquainted with your wishes. You may be sure that he will do nothing on the sly to put the sale past you and Lambert. I only ask a breathing space to give the question my best consideration. I should like to help you as far as I can for your own sake as well as for my old friend, your father's. I think we are agreed that this determination on your part, most commendable in many lights, though you are aware that I regard you as only too good to these children, need not alter our old relations, which I have always found very pleasant.\" A rupture with Mr. Stewart after all the trouble he had taken for her, all the friendly feeling he entertained for her, while she remained his honoured guest, notwithstanding she had gone against his opinion, was the very last event which Kirsten could have contemplated with satisfaction or even moderate composure. She would have been thank ful to have avoided it by much greater concessions"], [312, "Her Gentle Deeds. 300 than that he required. She was grateful to him for having saved her from the trial, by yielding up his own convictions and prepossessions \u2014 a difficult pro ceeding for any man, and especially hard for a magnate of a ducal chamberlain. Kirsten took it as a signal proof that Mr. and Mrs. Stewart, to whom, no doubt, he told her resolution at a spare moment, were kind, true-hearted people in spite of their worst faults, when so far from per mitting what they must class under the head of objectionable independence and eccentricity, perhaps low tastes, to alter their present behaviour to their guest, her host and hostess continued to treat her with particular regard. They brought her forward in spite of herself and lavished kindness upon her. The last display was made in the course of Kirsten's participation in the public festivals, dinners, and balls. She was presented for the first time in her life to their Graces. They were a personable couple who wore their honours not un becomingly, only it could not be denied that the Duke was a stout\u2014 what in a lower rank would have been called a fat little man ; while the Duchess, under the point de Venise lace coiffure, had a red face. In a humbler sphere it would have exposed her to a comparison with her cook after she had been exposed to the full blaze of the kitchen fire. The redness had nothing to do with the old courtly malpractice of rouging, indeed, the Duchess, with no"], [313, "Busy Mornings and Gay Evenings. 301 occasion for it in her own person, had been heard to scout the paint-pot with virtuous indignation. As for the Marquis, the hero of the day, with whom Kirsten might have had the honour of dancing if she had chosen, in spite of the bevies of fair damsels waiting eagerly for the distinction of his hand, he had as yet escaped the reproaches of fatness and redness as applied to his high estate. He was a brisk, threadpaper of a lad, with regard to whom it was difficult to believe that he had stood beneath the Great Pyramid, crossed the Rocky Mountains, and sailed among the coral reefs without being blown away in the process. He had not only achieved these comparatively ordinary feats nowadays, he was yet to become a power in the land, to keep company with princes, to preside over great gather ings in great interests, to help or to hinder the passing of laws the effects of which would be felt from castle to cottage, well-nigh from pole to pole. Yet at this moment he was cracking a joke with an old farmer, finding a seat for a Haythorpe worthy, heaping the plate of a school child \u2014 nay, anticipating a footman in offering a cup of coffee to Kirsten. The young woman pleased herself with taking it as a yet surer index of his healthy up-bringing, and promise of his honourable discharge of higher duties, that his father addressed him aside as \" Dicky,\" while his mother laughed at him to his whey-coloured, cheery, aspiring young face."], [314, "Her Gentle Deeds. 302 As a faint far-away copy of Queen Elizabeth stand ing up with her prime minister in \" the brawls,\" Mr. Stewart insisted on leading Kirsten to the top of a quadrille. One day he walked the whole length of the principal street of Haythorpe with Kirsten hanging on his arm, in defiance of modern fashion, and with out the slightest occasion for the support except what existed in the will and pleasure of the gentleman. Kirsten tried to express her gratitude and good will in an indirect manner, when Mr. Stewart always dismissed her with an affable entreaty that she would enjoy herself, as befitted her years, like the rest of the young people, for the next few days, leaving business cares to come afterwards. Certainly she never ex hausted the sense of the boon conferred on her, in the supply of endless subjects of entrancing conversation, wherewith to make up to the children for the general dreariness of their confinement and abstinence from what they considered rational companionship. The rigorous rules of polite society appeared to Kirsten to be strained by Mrs. Stewart when the girl found that, although other little people were admitted to the games and the early public dining and dancing, no hint was dropped which could warrant her in emancipating her brood, and carrying them with her to the ardently coveted treat of seeing their seniors disporting themselves. Yet the scenes would have been the very thing for children, none could have so"], [315, "Busy Mornings and Gay Evenings. 303 appreciated the gaieties or found so few drawbacks in them. But if baby and even Anina Stewart were systematically kept in the background, till Anina looked like a suppressed thunderstorm, Kirsten could not take upon herself to let loose her young children. Kirsten was sorry for her pets and playfellows, and seized every available opportunity for repairing to the nursery, and rehearsing to the children the shows going on down stairs and in the open air, on the Castle lawn, or in the Haythorpe meadows. Luckily Katie never tired of hearing what Lady Alice said and Miss Monckton and Ussie Stewart wore, who were their partners, what songs they sang and dances they danced. If Kirsten could have gone into the minuti\u00e6 of the \" smiles they smole \" she would still have found a fascinated listener. Even Beville was not averse to learning the marvels the Marquis had seen and the tricks little Lord Hugo played. Without such annals there would have been no end of Katie's plaintive lamentations. \"Where is the use of my wearing my best frock with nobody to see it ? If I were let go up to the Castle don't you think the Marquis might dance with me ? I could tell him that my papa was as good as a lord out in Australia, and my poor mamma was a lady. We had all sorts of nice things long ago, you know we had, Miss Stewart. We were not kept shut up in dismal nurseries or in a tiresome garden where all the fruit has been pulled.'"], [316, "Her Gentle Deeds. 304 As for poor Beville, he would not have contented himself with disgusted exclamations. \" The grub is very well, I have no fault to find with that, but a shaver does not live for just his grub. I want you, Miss Stewart. I want to run about to see all that is doing. I am not going to move to order like that miserable baby. Sa is ever so much better company. I am not going to have my knuckles rapped with a bit of whalebone every time I have a mind of my own. I can't stand this any longer. It was ever so much jollier in Howard Street ; a fellow had some thing to do and to see there. I'll run away to Mrs. Dawes \u2014 see if I ain't driven to it.\" Katie would have pined herself ill, Beville would have been committed to an outbreak, if Kirsten had not come to the rescue. She was wearily watched for in those comfortable nurseries, where mental and spiritual inanition prevailed and insurrection stood on tip-toe. Kirsten had gladly availed herself of a fresh arrival of guests in the already over-crowded house to accomplish the relinquishing of her room in the middle regions, and the taking possession of another nearer the sky in the vicinity of the children. She had won over \u2014 as Kirsten always did win over any reasonably honest servant \u2014 the mannerly but not ill-disposed nurse, whose burden the young lady lightened and whose dull life she enlivened. Baby Stewart began to show a slight glimmering of anima-"], [317, "Busy Mornings and Gay Evenings. 305 tion. Anina, who had hitherto disclaimed the com pany of the children, now put her dignity in her pocket and slid into the room to be present at the rehearsals and replicas, to put many questions and emit short laughs. Kirsten's appearance up-stairs came to be hailed with a jubilee of rejoicing which might have astonished the company below, that only recognised in her a quiet, possibly demure, stupid young woman. One day Kirsten snatched a quarter of an hour from dressing for a concert at Cope Hall, a frequent rash abstraction, which perhaps accounted for the incidents of her hasty choice of heavy white camellias for her hair, and the uniformity with which she fastened them, in the most expeditious, secure manner possible, at one side of her head. She came into the nursery in her scarlet dressing jacket to find Katie and Beville all right, rushing and hopping to meet her, but Sa was all wrong, sitting still in a corner, not looking up to greet the visitor. \"Are you not going to speak to me, Sa ? \" asked Kirsten surprised, sitting down and taking the child in her lap. \" Oh, she has been as tiresome as that all the afternoon ! \" reported Katie. \" I have danced to her, and Bev has made all his most horrible faces, but she does not mind a bit.\" \" But Baby Sa will mind her Kis,\" asserted Kirsten \u25a0with fond, fooUsh assurance, and then she cried out x"], [318, "Her Gentle Deeds. 306 in the greatest distress, \" Oh, nurse, what is the matter ? she does not see or hear me, though she is clasping my fingers tightly and is struggling off my knee.\" \" Bless you, ma'am, it is convulsions ! Stand back, children ! Lay down the poor lamb in her cot, Miss Stewart. Ring the bell, Miss Baby. I'll run myself and fetch Dr. Stewart, if he is in the house, and bring Mrs. Stewart, if you can wait by her, Miss Stewart. Don't touch her, only keep her from hurting herself. Don't be too frightened, she may be cutting a tooth without one guessing it, or her stomach may be a little out of order. The fit may pass in a minute or two ; but I must have hot water ready, for the doctor is sure to want that the first thing.\" \" Oh, run, run ! \" besought Kirsten ; \" never mind me. I'll fetch water from the bath room, if Katie can keep her in the cot. Oh, my pet, my darling little pet ! \" Mrs. Stewart had not returned from a drive, but happily Dr. Stewart was in the house and sprang up the nursery stairs, taking three steps at a time. Kirsten and the nurse worked under his directions, and in a short time the child was brought out of the fit and lay quiet and exhausted, while she was pro nounced not in danger for the present. Then Dr. Malise was free to remark that Kirsten Stewart wore a similar red jacket to that she had on"], [319, "Busy Mornings and Gay Evenings. 307 in the London hospital, which had made a bright spot in the cold whiteness and subdued colouring of the ward, and that it was the same sweet troubled face which had struck him and haunted him for months that was now bending in engrossed service over the sick child. He had still a vivid sense of identification, when, later in the evening, he left the concert-room for a few minutes to see how his little patient was getting on, though Kirsten had by that time put off the brilliant dressing jacket, and wore her black mourning gown again. She had declined to quit the nursery, giving no more than a faint smile of surprise to the proposal from Mrs. Stewart, who was confirming from her own experience and her son's verdict that in all probability poor little Sa would continue to do well. Kirsten might dress and enjoy the concert with a clear conscience. But Kirsten craved another form of enjoyment. Sa was sleeping peacefully, and Kirsten was watch ing her restored treasure from a little distance. To keep the other children quiet, she had Katie and Baby on one side of her, and Beville on the other. She was managing to carry on a narrative sotto voce to the two girls. She was helping the boy with his last puzzle. She was smoothing down the ruffled plumes of Anina, at the other end of the table, by Kirsten's unfeigned admiration of the girl's beautiful French embroidery. x 2"], [320, "308 Her Gentle Deeds. The whole tableau in its dim light, the chief strength of which fell on Anina's work, its saddened sound, its peace after a storm, its tender domesticity, was in broad contrast to the gay tumult below. It went to Malise's susceptible heart and touched all that was highest and best there. There are some women \u2014 the truly noble of their kind \u2014 who always look their best in home dress amidst home surroundings, and that not because these women are not thorough ladies and cannot bear the most splendid or exquisite adornment, but for the reason that in the costume and entourage which belong to the world they miss something of their most essential attributes. The statement is most fitly illustrated by a Pro testant use of different representations of the Virgin \u2014 the typical woman. The most satisfactory picture of her ever painted is Raphael's Madonna di San Sisto at Dresden, which shows her as a simple peasant girl, standing on the clouds, no doubt, but pressing them with bare, brown, way-worn feet, and holding in her slender arms, which yet have done their share of the world's work, the Divine child. The most unwelcome, well-nigh offensive, image of her whom Roman Catholics worship and all Christians call \" blessed,\" is such as one finds on some altars in chapels dedicated to the mother of the Lord, when the wife of the carpenter Joseph appears as a very fine lady indeed, in the conventional white"], [321, "Busy Mornings and Gay Evenings. 309 satin and pearls, with a lace handkerchief in * her left hand. Dr. Malise lingered in his mission to the nursery, though he found no great call there for what he had acquired in the schools. He stayed till Katie and the rest compelled the narrator to continue her tale. Kirsten was still under the influence of the reaction which accompanies a deliverance from threatened tribulation. She looked very happy and waxed frank and vivacious, doing justice to herself. He heard scraps of the brightest, most humorous versions of scenes in which he had borne a part, and now discovered them, to his amazement, transformed and radiant. \" What a shame of you to hide your talent under a bushel, Miss Stewart ! \" he protested in earnest. \" What a sell to us dolts who were turning ourselves inside out, and standing on our heads for your enter tainment, when you could have entertained us with the least trouble in the world ! Why, you might have made our acted proverbs twice as good as we made them. It seems,\" he added grudgingly, \" as if you could have brought out touches of fun and dealt clever hits all round, if you had exerted yourself to join in the game, which would have constituted us quite a brilliant company. You, a Haythorpe woman, one of ourselves, not to do your best for us, for the Duke and the Marquis and everybody!\" he finished, in accents of the deepest reproach."], [322, "Her Gentle Deeds. 310 \"Oh, no, I am not guilty!\" Kirsten defended herself, laughing, but still careful to preserve the undertone he had forgotton to maintain. \" I cannot come forward as an original performer. I am not competent to do more than look on, listen, and receive impressions. I always require another per son to supply the hair for such trumpery tethers as I can twist.\" \" May I supply the hair if you consent to twist the tethers for grown-up people as well as children ? Who knows, the prospect of being made such good use of might improve the quality of the hair,\" suggested Malise. The sleeping child awoke and stirred. \" Kis,\" she babbled, \" Kis, bring Sa's birdie.\" \" Yes, my lamb.\" Kirsten, who was all eyes and ears for her, started up in a moment. \" Kis is here, Kis is coming with the birdie.\" He thought the quaint, homely name, which he had ridiculed only the other day, in its contrast with the Mauds, Ediths, Ussies, &c, by which he was surrounded, thus abbreviated and stripped of its thorns, as a poet has put it, by soft baby lips, the sweetest sound he had ever heard. A new intoxi cation had entered the young man's good heart and was mounting to his brain. He withdrew reluctantly to his post in the concert-room, though the amateur music was very fair, and his seat, by Mrs. Stewart's contrivance, next that of Miss Monckton."], [323, "Busy Mornings and Gay Evenings. 311 Miss Monckton's toilet on this occasion was a veritable study of Worth's. It consisted of a gown of the colour of the heart of a Gloire de Dijon, and was marvellously fashioned, with sapphires as the jewels to match. It was one of those dresses so enthusiastically summed up and passionately prized by Parisian and American adepts, and by certain sections of the British public. These judges all appear to agree that the feathers do next to every thing for the bird, which without the costly, ravish ing plumage would be nothing. The sentence sounds like a dressmaker and milliner's advertisement and an overthrow of the reasonable order of things, but let that pass. Miss Monckton showed herself not unworthy of her apparel. She was suave and at the same time daintily piquante to her schoolfellow, Ussie's brother, the handsome yellow-haired young doctor, who was far beyond a mere country doctor, since he was the son of the great Duke's great chamberlain. But the singular fellow continued languid and absent-minded in the middle of these irresistible allurements. Strange to say, there was one young man in the world who felt inclined to prefer to a beauty and heiress smiling at him out of a gown of Worth's, a pale girl in a black frock under the dim light of a sick child's nursery, contented to amuse a parcel of troublesome children who were not of her blood."], [324, "CHAPTER XIX A SHATTERED HEARTH HE crash came, as all crashes come, like the descent of a thunderbolt. Sa was better, the festivities were over, and the guests rapidly departing. Kirsten had been pressed to stay to the end and beyond the end, for it was understood the business part of the Marquis's coming of age was to begin with the close of the rejoicings. Indeed, at the last of these, the opening of the Mechanics' Institute, the Duke appeared, accom panied by a stranger, a junior member of his Grace's firm of London lawyers who had come down ex pressly, it was said, to go into the accounts. There could be no question that fresh aid was called for \u2014 a Duke's great property is a huge responsibility. Mr. Stewart had been so fagged by the accumulation of offices from the role of Master of Ceremonies to that of Chancellor of the Exchequer turned over upon him lately, that he had startled everybody by the extreme haggardness of his looks at the last demonstration. Dr. Malise, who had been making progress in his"], [325, "A Shattered Hearth. 313 acquaintance with Kirsten, and indulging in sundry confidences to her, had told her he was afraid there was something wrong with his father's health, and that serious mischief was developing itself. He, Malise, was anxious about it, and about the governor's over-worked condition. Mr. Stewart had been forced to own to more than one fit of giddiness and exhaustion lately, but he shook his son off and would not hear of an examination, said he was a great deal too busy for swallowing drugs, and laughed to scorn the most distant hint of any inter ruption to his business. \"It is your calling to look out for squalls and propose a pilot or a doctor, my boy ; but I shall take the liberty of sticking to mine, on which I entered before you were born, which is quite enough for my powers, without stopping to feel my pulse or to let a lad like you poke me in the ribs or peer at my tongue so long as I can help it. Nonsense ! I shall be all right when this hurly-burly is over.\" Kirsten came down later than usual on a certain morning, but when she looked into the breakfast room, to her astonishment she found it empty. She had heard nothing during the night in her remote quarter, so that it came upon her with a shock to be told at last that Mr. Stewart had been seized with violent illness a few hours before, and though he was considerably better, his state remained critical. The whole house was in commotion as a matter of course."], [326, "Her Gentle Deeds. 314 Mrs. Stewart did not put in an appearance at break fast. Ussie, though she behaved with remarkable composure for her age and sex, looked constrained and agitated. More might have been expected from her elder brother. He was a man, and his profession rendered him in a sense master of the situation. Perhaps it enlightened him only too full}', for Malise Stewart, while he maintained his self-control by an evident effort, was himself very pale, and had the air of a man stunned by a blow, and struggling ineffectually against its bitter consequences of care and distress. Kirsten could not help feeling that if Malise Stewart betrayed his feelings thus plainly, even where the illness of a member of his family was concerned, he had mistaken his profession and should not have been a doctor. She was puzzled to recall the comparatively calm, filial feeling with which he had expressed to her his concern on his father's account within the last twenty-four hours ; a dreaded misfortune was very different from its realisation. Still he must have good hope of Mr. Stewart's re covery, for when Kirsten had asked for the sick man his son had assured her, in a pre-occupied, not very cheerful manner certainly, but without hesitation, \" Oh ! my father will do very well.\" Did he not believe what he said ? Was it mere conventional or official language, such as he used to the messengers from the Castle ? It was neither the Duke nor the"], [327, "A Shattered Hearth. 315 Marquis who came in person, as Kirsten fancied they had called on smaller pretexts. She began to fear that their high position involved a miserable temptation to selfishness. But what did it all mean ? Was there a mystery which she did not penetrate ? Were the last guests better informed ? Had they read between the lines of the bulletin, since the most easy-going and frivol ous of the travellers took leave of Ussie and Malise with hardly-concealed perturbation and gravity, and set off without a moment's unnecessary delay ? It did not require the sentence which fell from Malise's lips for the benefit of one of these people, and was caught up by Kirsten, to convince her that she must go immediately. \" I shall have my father removed as soon as possible,\" Malise had said in an abrupt, nervous manner. Kirsten must leave before then, if she could not be of use to Mrs. Stewart in the sick-room or elsewhere, as a radical quality in the girl's nature made her yearn to be. Mr. and Mrs. Stewart's recent kindness to her increased the desire, but they had their own children at hand, and if they did not express a wish for her presence she could not intrude on them. Mrs. White's rooms were ready for Kirsten and the children ; she had only to mention her intended departure to the representatives of her host and hostess, and assure them of her sympathy in the quiet brief phrase which meant much."], [328, "316 Her Gentle Deeds. Ussie did not care to listen. She had not taken kindly to Kirsten. The girl might do so some day, but she had felt no need of the woman as yet. It was the same with Donald and Jock. But it was different with Anina. She had broken loose from confinement with the banishing of the company. Instead of following Ussie she followed Kirsten, and pressed her for an explanation. \" What ails papa ? Why may I not go to him and mamma ? He is not so ill as that comes to, for I saw him through the open door of his dressing-room before mamma called to me to go away. He was up and dressed, sitting with mamma. He did not look very ill. What does Malise mean by removing papa ? Where is he to remove him to, and where from ? Never mind my grammar, though you have been a governess. I am not an infant like Baby, to be put off with childish excuses ; surely I am old enough and sharp enough to be told what matters as much to me as to Ussie, though I am not fit to go into company.\" Kirsten could not explain to the hurt, indignant girl, though flashes of cross lights were begin ning to illuminate her mental sight, in a distract ing, bewildering way. It became clear that Malise was inclined to trust Kirsten as Anina did, and to repair to her for solace and support. He met her confused words of condo lence and leave-taking with something which sounded"], [329, "A Shattered Hearth. 317 like disappointment and absolute reproach. \" So you are going to desert us too, Miss Stewart ? \" Then he checked himself, \" Well, of course we have no right to detain you.\" \" If I could be of any use to Mr. and Mrs. Stewart \" \u2014 she began, with wistful apologies. \"Have you not seen my mother this morning?\" he inquired quickly. \"Do you not know that my father and she and Ussie are to start for Leamington this afternoon ? I thought women w ere good for helping each other to pack,\" and he gave a forced laugh. The two were standing together in the disarranged drawing-room, which had not been touched since the family quitted it on the previous evening, as if the servants had not found time or heart to put it to rights. Chairs were standing about, books and iUustrated papers tossed here and there, Ussie's music was lying in disorder on the open piano. Everything was in the confusion which precedes the break-up of an established order of things. \" I did not know,\" she said faintly. \" I am glad to hear Mr. Stewart is able to travel.\" \" Oh ! my father's illness was bad enough,\" he exclaimed vehemently, almost harshly, \" though the effects are passing off. He has not been well for some time. You remember I told you he was not himself, and I fear he will never be the same man again. He is better away from this at once.\""], [330, "318 Her Gentle Deeds. She looked up as indignant as Anina had shown herself. \" That is, he has worn himself out, and the sooner he is got rid of the better. He has spent his strength for the Duke. I know Mr. Stewart has been working like ten men ever since I came here \u2014 never taking rest, never out of harness ; and when the faithful horse staggers and falls in the traces, his Grace does not so much as come to the front to see what is wrong.\" \" No, no, you must not speak like that,\" he said, putting his hand with force on hers, \" There may be what hushing up of the matter is possible, though you will hear it discussed in twenty fashions in Haythorpe before the day is done, but there must be no unfairness here. Perhaps part of what I have to tell is not such news to you as it was to me, for it is always those who are nearest that know least. I was aware that my father was not a rich man, but I only learnt this morning that he is over head and ears in debts and difficulties. Have you heard that before ? \" \" Yes, that has been said.\" The words were wrung from her reluctantly. He walked away with something like a groan. \" What must people have thought of us ? How could we do it ? A place like this ; nothing grudged \u2014 nothing spared. Good heavens, it was only the other day that I was doubtful about the propriety of becoming Dr. Harrison's successor. It was so early"], [331, "A Shattered Hearth. 319 to settle down \u2014 I might study a little longer in Paris or Vienna \u2014 I might set up at once in London.\" While he spoke she had rallied. It was the most natural thing in the world for her to administer com fort ; to say soothing, sincere words of reasonable reassurance and encouragement. \" A great deal was demanded from your father's position. It must have been a strong temptation to a man of his hospitable nature and love of company. He could not alto gether help himself in some things ; not in these final gaieties. He was devoted to the Duke's interest. Perhaps, if Mr. Stewart had spared more time for his own affairs \" \u2014 she faltered a little \u2014 \" but that is the less reason for his being cast off now, the moment his health fails and there is any \u2014 any discovery of his embarrassed circumstances.\" \" No, no, a hundred times no ! you are all wrong,\" he said passionately, with a gesture of keen pain and sorrow. \" You are too innocent and upright yourself to follow the clue. This is not a case of Wolsey serving his king better than his God ; to our shame it is the reverse. The Haythorpe people will not be so guile less and merciful as you are. But I must make the truth clear to you without leaving you to do battle with rough guesses and sarcastic inuendoes. It is hard enough for me, but that hardship may go with the rest. There is no occasion to speak of my feelings,\" he exclaimed, with a reckless severity to himself and scorn of himself bred of his misery. \" It"], [332, "Her Gentle Deeds. 320 would be doubling our offences, it would be abomin- able in me to keep silent when I am called on to speak, even though the silence were to shield my poor father effectually. Miss Stewart, there is not a word to be said against the Duke ; on the contrary, he has behaved with the greatest forbearance and generosity ; so has the Marquis \u2014 to a far greater degree than we had any right to hope for. Right ! we have no right ; we cannot so much as claim indulgence from those we have wronged. I am bound in common honesty, not to say in bare grati- tude, to proclaim this. The Duke has offered my father a retiring allowance. His Grace has volun- teered to finish my brothers and sisters' education, though Donald and Jock will be mean curs if they do not make short work of their share of his bounty, and I shall relieve his Grace of my younger sisters. It is not he who is driving us out of Cope Hall post haste. He has guaranteed the use of it to us as long as we need it, at least till he has appointed another chamberlain. But even my mother and Ussie see it is advisable that we should clear out without waiting for the arrival of my father's successor. Must I say more \u2014 that the lawyer feUow has found the Duke's accounts in confusion ; that there is a horrible defi ciency, which, if I live, I will make good, though it take me to the last day of my life and cost my last penny.\" She was dumb in feUow- feeling with his humiliation."], [333, "A Shattered Hearth. 321 \" Miss Stewart, when my father returned from an interview at the Castle late yesterday afternoon, he must have wandered about and then shut himself up for hours. My mother did not know he had come back. He did not appear in the evening, but he has been often absent on business lately.\" He grew more and more agitated, and turned away to* hide his agitation and to avoid seeing the distress he would cause. \" People will say his illness was a sham ; but at least there is no falseness here. I had rather you knew the truth. My father was so mad as to try to put himself away by swallowing a dose of laudanum.\" Kirsten could not suppress a cry, \"O! horrible.\" \"Yes, it was horrible,\" he said, with a shudder, commanding himself by another effort. \" But don't give way. He has been brought round. He will not make a second attempt on his life. The very fact that the catastrophe he dreaded has come to pass is a relief; so is the knowledge that no further exposure than has happened will occur, and that an arrange- ment has been made. I told you he was not himself; there were symptoms of mischief to the brain. No wonder, poor old fellow ! \" exclaimed the young man, with a sudden break and choke of relenting affection in his voice. \" I do not understand how he could seek to get off and leave us to stand the consequences; but he must have been on the rack for months \u2014 years. My mother, too, with her unavoidable sus- Y"], [334, "Her Gentle Deeds. 322 picions, was nearly driven beside herself. It was she who missed him at last, suspected the truth, and called me in just in time to rectify the deed, to which only she and I and you need be privy.\" \" I am so sorry,\" was Kirsten's piteous exclama tion, as she stood there white and shaking ; \" and they put themselves about to have me here, and loaded me with kindness,\" she reflected simply. He got very red, and looked at her with fresh trouble ; mortification, doubt, and dread getting in his honest eyes, and clouding and contracting his smooth brows. \" I cannot stop,\" he said, with a gasp. \" I dare not, if it be for any advantage to you that I should speak out \u2014 if the warning do not come too late. I have not been altogether open with you in making it appear that my chief object was to clear the Duke's character in your eyes, though I am bound to do that also. It is so easy to go off the square. It may be in my blood,\" he added im patiently, and with a tinge of bitter mockery, not at all like the man. \" But it is a trial \u2014 though it is worse than idle to dwell upon it \u2014 to enlarge on my own father's disgrace, even though it is for an inno cent, trusting woman's sake. To come to the point, Miss Stewart, you have succeeded to some money lately, and it was in my father's hands. Has he made haste to lay it out for you, or has he been tempted to plunder his old friend's daughter, who will thus have been twice robbed of her due, as well"], [335, "A Shattered Hearth. 323 as to appropriate the funds of his employer?\" he finished, with stern hardness. It was she who cried, \" No, oh no ! \" this time, with eagerness so great that it amounted to lively satisfac tion. \" Indeed, you are wronging him grievously. That money is perfectly safe ; you and everybody may be at rest about it. I know, I am certain, for I got the bank receipt that it might be ready when Dr. Lambert and Nash, the bookseller, should want it.\" So far Mr. Stewart was exculpated from injuring Kirsten. But when she recovered from the sickening shock she had undergone, and was able to think the matter over, she could not, in her candour and com mon sense, escape some painful conclusions. First, the wretched man, who had passed so rapidly from the height of fool-hardy confidence to the other extreme of cowardly despair, had aimed at the modest sum secured to her as a forlorn stopgap in the yawning gulf of his obligations. When that was rendered out of his power by her persistence in the proposed purchase, he had condescended to man\u0153uvre for the credit, in the eyes of his world, of continuing her guardian and man of business in the disposal of the legacy \u2014 the amount of which common rumour was tolerably sure to exaggerate. The conviction humbled and wounded her honour able, generous nature. But it would have been still worse if there could have been much question of the correctness of her conclusions. If she could have y 2"], [336, "Her Gentle Deeds. 324 fancied that she might be cruelly unjust in suspect ing the Stewarts without reason, the uncertainty would have been torture to her. What, was she to visit on them their folly and unrighteousness by wholesale scepticism ? She was so much younger, she was the daughter of country people and former friends. It was not for her to deal out to them retri bution in the shape of utter distrust and condem nation, which, however they had deserved it from others, old familiar relations and their continued kindness to her had not merited. But there had been no kindness in the end, as Kirsten, who was not a fool, saw for herself. She did not draw the sad inference from the circum stance of Mr. and Mrs. Stewart's shunning a personal leave-taking ; that might have been prompted by natural feeling. When Kirsten did chance, in spite of herself, to encounter her ex-guardian and his wife, they met her with perfect indifference. They hardly noticed her. They were full of them selves, for which there was some excuse. Yet what good heart could have wholly overlooked the sub dued sensibility' of her greeting, her tender terror lest she should betray any part of her painful knowledge, her restrained but unconcealable longing to help them still in any way ? On the contrary, they treated her as they would have treated the slightest acquaintance, the merest stranger. There was not one word even of how she was to get back to Hay-"], [337, "A Shattered Hearth. 325 thorpe ; what she was to do there ; what was to become of her and the children. These mannerly, hospitable people forgot both mannerliness and hospitality in their cold and careless good-byes. It was unmistakable that they blotted Kirsten from their minds thenceforth, as it did not appear that she could be of any further service to them. There are fair-weather parents, alas ! as there are fair-weather friends. Mr. and Mrs. Stewart had been engrossed and carried away by their pride in their promising family, with regard to which the credulous vanity of the seniors had cherished the conviction that the juniors might attain any social eminence and insure no end of credit to the authors of their being. The natures of the father and mother were by no means calculated to care so violently for the offspring who had helped to bring about their mis fortunes, and who in them. There was not much enthusiasm to be evoked for a young doctor whose great expectations had passed away, and who must drudge and struggle like any ordinary medical practitioner, without the most distant probability of his winning an heiress or being transferred to London by the influence of a duke. Besides, Malise, in the middle of his distress for his kith and kin, had taken it upon him to air his mind ever so little, and to blurt out \u2014 though, to do his filial duty justice he strove to keep silence \u2014 his scrupulous incredulity, wrath, and affront, while his"], [338, "Her Gentle Deeds. 326 self-reproach sounded like a vicarious reproach to the controllers of his destiny. There was nothing very charming about a plain looking, sharp-tongued girl like Anina, or about lads of mediocre capacity and temper, at the most tire some, ticklish age, like Donald and Jock. Even though his Grace thought fit to see them through their school and college days, they would be con stantly over-spending their allowances and falling back on their father's paltry pittance. They would find up-hill work before them, would very likely drift to the colonies, and end their lives as obscure emigrants, without capital or enterprise. As for a great baby verging on her teens, she had not the attraction of real babyhood, while she had all its helplessness. She would be an intolerable drag in furnished apartments where a nurse could not be kept for her benefit. The only thing for her was school banishment for the next five or six years \u2014 the expenses of which the Duke, in his fine show of liberality, had agreed to undertake, among the few favours he could grant his late indefatigable chamberlain. Ussie \u2014 well, Ussie might go with her father and mother. Ussie must learn to do with gowns and ackets from a less distinguished modiste than Madame Elise ; but Ussie could still confer a cer tain distinction on her guardian, and infuse anima tion into their shattered, narrowed life, while she"], [339, "A Shattered Hearth. 327 could look after herself and promote her own interests in a fashionable watering-place. The move was not altogether bad for Ussie. She had an intuitive per ception of that fact on the instant, and boasted to Anina, in the short space between the family down fall and the rescue from the wreck, of the acquaint ances and partners she counted on meeting at Leamington, with vague, decorous references to the conquests she should finish by accomplishing. All that Mr. and Mrs. Stewart and Ussie cared for at this moment was to escape paying the full penalty, by getting away from Cope Hall, and leaving the others to bear the heaviest brunt of the ordeal which was to be endured. Mr. Stewart was querulous about the amount of inconvenience he still suffered from the lingering remains of the recent illness which he had brought upon himself. He joined with his wife in engrossing efforts to procure on the shortest notice every possible alleviation of the fatigue and tedium of the journey. Air cushions, foot muffs, game sandwiches, flasks with every imaginable restorative and refreshment, club books, society papers, nothing was omitted. With the exception of a few privileges peculiar to heir rank, the Duke and Duchess could not have arranged to travel more luxuriously. As for the Marquis, he had always roughed it, by preference, even in civilised countries. Ussie was only concerned lest she should, in the"], [340, "Her Gentle Deeds. 328 necessarily hurried inventory of her possessions, when she had pressed Anina and every maid-servant she could appropriate into her service, have for gotten some article all important for her embellish ment or enjoyment. The state of mind in which the departing Stewarts took their dismissal from the Duke's service was not edifying. Reaction must arise with regret, repentance, and wholesome confusion of face. Selfishness could not have it all its own way for long. Fatherly, motherly, even sisterly affection ought to reassert itself; but for the present it was as if sudden adversity had formed the touchstone which sudden prosperity often shows itself, in producing a violent, almost ghastly disillusionment, revealing with brutal abruptness and plainness all the ugly flaws of character. No ; Kirsten had not to reproach herself with gratuitously thinking evil, and suspecting her neigh bour without a cause. Nay, she could only utter a faint protest against Dr. Lambert's fervent congratu lations on her having come scathless out of the hands of Mr. Stewart, who had made a prey of no less a person than the Duke, not to say of society at large. But there was one great comfort to Kirsten in the miserable business ; the friendly doctor in the hospital, little Sa's devoted physician, had cleared himself from any conscious participation in the self-seeking"], [341, "A Shattered Hearth. 329 squandering and dishonesty of which Mr. Stewart had been found guilty. The world is apt to be crushing in its laggard judgments, and loose in its application of its sentences. But however coolly its members might now be disposed to look on every root and branch of the Stewart race, so that Kirsten herself, because of her clan, came in for a waft of suspicion, no tongue which wagged in his native place was so heartless and vindictive as to pretend that Malise Stewart could really help his father's misconduct, or that the young man's having been well educated and thoroughly trained without his being aware at what unwarrantable expense, con stituted him a sharer in the iniquity. This mere justice was undoubtedly aided by the magnanimity of the Duke and the Marquis, who vindicated their title to nobility by drawing, here as elsewhere, a strict line between the sinner and one of his victims. The heads of the great house continued to lend their marked support to poor Malise, whose manly frank ness of confession and grief for the fault of one near and dear to him, with his youthful zeal for restitution, they fully appreciated. Another instance of the good which may come out of evil, appeared to foreshadow itself in what the change in the family fortunes was doing for Anina. She soon followed Kirsten in her retreat to Mrs. White's. The girl looked at once brighter and more softened than Kirsten had ever seen her. \" Do you"], [342, "Her Gentle Deeds. 330 know what is to become of me, Miss Stewart ? Malise is to take me to keep house for him. He is to have a house in Haythorpe \u2014 not Dr. Harrison's, he says he will not be able to afford that for a long time, if ever. He is to hire quite a small house, only it will be large enough to hold him and me and Baby, with one servant ; he can afford that. He says I am quite old enough to begin to keep house if I care about it and take pains, for I must not be extravagant, though I have not been old enough to put my nose out of a school-room before. I don't believe it matters much now whether I am pretty or plain. I may be as good a housekeeper and every bit as useful ; indeed, a great deal more so than Ussie. She never cares for anything except her dress and her music which she is to exhibit in public, and her beauty-sleep to preserve her complexion. I have never been allowed to dress like Ussie. I have worse than no complexion to speak of, and a nose and chin of which mamma and papa are ashamed. I am not musical in public ; but I can be as good a housekeeper. Is it not a mercy that there is an opening for me ? And oh ! Miss Stewart, Malise hopes you will allow me to come often to you to be told what to do. I don't mean to boast, but I was not slow in learning anything I was interested in at school. He says you can show me everything a woman should be and do.\" It might be in reference to her brother's care for"], [343, "A Shattered Hearth. 331 Anina that Malise Stewart, who was constrained to call and look after Sa, said to Kirsten, in the course of a sorrowful allusion to all that had passed, \" Do you think that I can ever be thankful for it ? A year ago I would not have believed, in spite of Shakespeare's verdict on adversity ; but I am not so sure now. I can never be anything but grieved to the bottom of my heart that trouble has come in this way ; still I have an idea already that without it I might have become more and more a frivolous ass, a stupid idiot, a worldly-hearted, self-indulgent, low-minded wretch.\" These were hard words to say of himself; not withstanding the hardness, there might have been some grains of truth in them, as both he and Kirsten knew."], [344, "CHAPTER XX. A FRESH HOUSEHOLD LAMP LIT. IRSTEN had done all she had projected, and prospered fairly in doing it. She had served an encouraging apprentice- ship to a bookseller, and proceeded to become a bookseller herself. Haythorpe had been forced to consent to the anomaly, as a great many other places besides Haythorpe must consent to greater anomalies before the host of women, without work or wages, are suited with the means of usefulness and a livelihood. Haythorpe had righted itself after the disorder of its precedents and standards, and, upon the whole, Dr. Lambert's words had come to pass. Only old acquaintances whose very limited share of brains and hearts did not leave much room for regret, because of their loss, dropped Kirsten from their visiting lists, banished her from their houses, and only knew her as a shop-woman in her shop. All the same, Kirsten had not much leisure for visiting. She had to lead a diligent, well-nigh toil some life to meet the demands and responsibilities of trade, which pressed upon her more than they"], [345, "A fresh Household Lamp lit. 333 would have pressed upon a man, since she was not accustomed to them, could not always measure their comparative importance, and grew frightened at them sometimes. But she was in her native town, re spected in her own person and in the persons of her \" forebears.\" She was able to call to her assistance more than one qualified, trustworthy adviser besides Dr. Lambert ; above all, her calm, patient judgment qualified her to discriminate between advisers and advice, while experience eventually inspired her with self-reliance. The spectacle of a gentlewoman not merely work ing for her own hand, but working to support the three children who had been thrown on her, grew upon the town, and influenced it, especially in its young people, for good. This was not the less true that they could not fail to see that Kirsten Stewart had to deny herself in many an engagement and amusement which would otherwise have been per missible and advisable for her age and condition, which surely must have had some attraction for her, that she might carry on her business and pursue, without risk of loss, the even tenour of her way. Kirsten underwent the self-denial cheerfully for thc children's sake. She counted herself more than re compensed when Katie and Beville acquitted them selves creditably at their respective schools, and became even prouder of helping her with her books and papers, and of serving under her in the shop,"], [346, "Her Gentle Deeds. 334 than they had been of dusting and sweeping and cleaning boots and knives for Mrs. Dawes in Howard Street. Though Kirsten might sometimes, when she was fagged and dispirited, feel tempted to wish things had been different, and that she could have com passed the impossibility of both keeping the cake and eating it, she was far from ever deliberately and seriously regretting the step she had taken. When the momentary depression was over, and she had returned to her normal healthy frame of mind, she keenly enjoyed entertaining Mrs. Dawes and Emily Anne in succession for their holidays, and having down one and another ofthe poor governesses she had known to afford them country quarters gratis. At last she felt justified in hiring, on liberal terms, a poor gentlewoman who had the sense to recognise and accept the benefit of being trained to serve in the shop. In the meantime, Malise Stewart had established himself in the confidence of Haythorpe as well as in the practice of his predecessor. He was soon known to be a clever, humane young fellow, who improved the family disaster by applying himself sedulously to study and work, living down the shade which had fallen on his family by an industrious, simple, upright life. The Duke accepted one or two faithful contributions in payment of the family debt, but then declined to touch another farthing of"], [347, "A fresh Household Lamp lit. 335 Malise's earnings. The creditor succeeded in recon ciling the rebellious debtor by proxy to the discharge from his father's obligations. His Grace made a statement which afforded some balm to the sore heart of the son. \" Your father was an excellent agent on my behalf for a number of years. I owe him the increased value of more than one source of my income. You will allow me to take this into account, and to consider that, at the date at which we are speaking, it more than balances the un fortunate deficiency. As to the retiring allowance, his invalid state commands that under any circum stances. It has always been the practice of my family to give such annuities,\" ended the Duke, in his grand way. \" I hope, Doctor, you do not propose to alter our habits ? \" Malise was not at liberty to press the matter further. Ussie had married to the satisfaction of her mother. Her father liad sunk rapidly into an in firm state, and become hardly equal to having a voice in the question. It was to be supposed Ussie had done well for herself in a worldly sense. Baby had been summoned home to fill her sister's place in the wandering watering-place life. A change had come over the course of Anina's ambition. It was proved that she had not naturally what is familiarly called \" a turn \" for housekeeping. It would always be an acquired taste and a forced"], [348, "Her Gentle Deeds. 336 accomplishment with her. She would never attain the highest rank in that line. But her brother had discovered that she could be of the greatest use to him as an assistant in his profession. He proved her faculty in this respect. He cultivated it as far as he could. Then he sent her away from him to one of the colleges for women, where she im mediately took the most valuable scholarship, and found herself a self-supporting woman, to her great delight and the envy of Katie Owen. It was a second shock to the same generation ot the natives of Haythorpe, to learn that Anina Stewart was coming out as a doctor, and, for any thing that the town knew, might return and become her brother's partner, dividing his practice with him, taking the women and children for the most part, while he retained the men. Here again the Castle was of value in dissipating a prejudice. The Marquis had married with, as it happened, an important result to Anina. The Marchioness believed devoutly in the capabilities of her sex and was warmly in favour of employing them to render aid to a sister woman in an English castle no less than in an Indian zenana. She would not yield the palm of common sense, delicacy, and fitness to a Hindoo Begum. The first time the Marchioness's finger ached after Anina had completed all that was necessary of her studies, when she and the Marchioness were established respectively at Hay-"], [349, "A fresh Household Lamp lit. 337 thorpe and the Castle, the lady sent for the doctor's sister in preference to the doctor, a choice which filled him with generous elation. In the prospect of the great arrival on the stage of human existence of the future Marquis, the lady who had the most to do with the event insisted that he should enter the world under the auspices of a woman like his mother, and, as in this single instance, the Marchioness was more powerful than the dumbfounded, conquered Duke or the Marquis either, she had her way, and established a fashion in Haythorpe which was likely to tell far and near for Dr. Anina Stewart. Then a marvel presented itself, which was partly the result of the happy, healthful, full employment of every faculty and the satisfaction which is the reward of such employment, and partly the effect of one of those unexpected changes between immaturity and maturity which baffles every previous conjecture. Dr. Anina, who had been the ugly duck of the family in her girlhood, developed into its most fine looking member. Her complexion cleared, her fea tures, too, seemed to clear and come out more sharply cut and refined by their expression of intelligence, ardour, and benevolence. Her carriage was perfect. She outshone Ussie in physical beauty. Her mother mourned over what she regarded as the throwing away of so much marriageable capital. But Malise only felt a new pride in his professional partner because of her womanly comeliness. z"], [350, "338 Her Gentle Deeds. Donald and Jock Stewart had, as was anticipated, betaken themselves to the colonies and were fighting or falling on their own account. Malise had served his apprenticeship to family adversity. He had manfully fulfilled his indentures, and was free now to think of his own needs and wishes, and to please himself. But when he went straightway to Kirsten Stewart he found still a barrier \u2014 three solid barriers to his hopes. Kirsten had quitted Mrs. White's apartments and established herself and her children in a house of her own. Her father and mother's house had oppor tunely fallen empty. Kirsten re-occupied it, but this tangible proof of her prosperity did not to her mind free her of her obligations. \" I cannot give up my children,\" she told him plainly, though with tears in her eyes, as well as blushes on her cheeks. \" I have never been able to understand how any real mother could resign her children. I am only their adopted mother, yet the}* have long been my own to me. I know many people would tell me I have no right to sacrifice you and myself for them, that I am bound to think of you and myself before them. But I will take myself into my own hands \u2014 at least I am entitled to do that \u2014 and as for you, oh ! you will soon get another woman to love. \" You will find plenty more women where one would serve you, as my dear old mother used to say,\" Kirsten began again smiling a little, \" each of them"], [351, "A fresh Household Lamp lit. 339 ready and willing to become your wife, to devote her whole heart and life to you, as you are entitled to ask of her. But my poor children will find no other mother. They cannot do without me for years to come ; they will always share my heart. It is not meet that you should wait any longer, or that a young man like you, prepared to give all on your part, should stoop to a divided heart. No, no ; for get what you have only said to-day and merely let me guess before. Think no more of me in this light. Leave me to my children.\" He had heard her to the end and he was not deeply wounded or bitterly offended by what she said of a divided heart. He had always known it. He had little of his father and mother's thin-skinned, greedy vanity. He was a fine, sweet-blooded large hearted fellow himself. Instead of being hurt or angry, it was happiness enough to him to hear her own, as it seemed to him she owned, that he had half of her heart, that it would be a life-and-death struggle, in which only one obligation could compel her to give him up. But there was not the slightest call to give him up. As if Kirsten Stewart had not a big enough heart for him and her children ! As if one half of her heart was not twice as big as the whole hearts of nine hundred and ninety-nine women out of the thousand ! And when it took him in, would it not also take in and find ample room for his broken- z 2"], [352, "Her Gentle Deeds. 340 down father, his disappointed mother \u2014 who could no longer object to the match \u2014 Anina, who had long ago claimed Kirsten as her best friend, down to his remotest kindred ? And oh ! the absurdity of her pretending that he could find another love, another woman, among the millions of women, to be named in the same breath with her, who had not only done virtuously, but who had excelled them all. He had to cry out against that outrageous asser tion. He had to return to his old mingled, extra vagant contempt of his young self, and inclination to hug himself and be humbly thankful for having escaped the huge blunder of missing the one prize and joy in life for him. \"To think I was such a dolt as to be guilty of overlooking and undervaluing you when Mrs. Dawes, bless the woman ! the dearest old soul in the universe, brought you to me in Howard Street ! I believe I did you some justice in the hospital, but I was an ass again \u2014 a double-distilled donkey \u2014 during the first few days of the renewal of our acquaintance here at Haythorpe. To imagine I could ever for a moment have been content with a well-got-up crystal instead of a half-hidden diamond, a camellia for a rose ! But,\" he broke off with a comical recollection, \" it was you who were fond of camellias in those days \u2014 stiff, monumental flowers, not like the pretty, trailing periwinkles you wore at Dr. Lambert's grand daughter's party the other night.\""], [353, "A fresh Household Lamp lit. 341 Kirsten smiled, in spite of her trouble, with a woman's pleasure at his remembering, even disparag ingly what she had worn years and years before\u2014 she smiled still more brightly at his praise of the later decoration. \" Oh ! the periwinkles. Beville saw them on the bank where he was fishing and gathered them for me, and Katie twined them \u2014 she has a pretty fancy in such matters. I have heard her mother was the only well-dressed woman in Sydney when she went out first. If it had not been to please the children I might not have troubled to wear the flowers, for I am getting too old.\" \" Nonsense,\" he interrupted her brusquely, \" how old are you ? Six or seven-and-twenty ? I know you are younger than I am. If you will not take the trouble of dressing to please yourself and the public of Haythorpe, you must do it to please me,\" he said with an audacious air of proprietorship, which was only excused by the fond presumption of the en croachment. \" The Bible itself has found a simile in a bride adorned for her husband,\" Malise defended himself. \" But what should I have been \u2014 what would have become of me if Miss Monckton or Clara La Zouche had fallen to my lot \u2014 though I don't doubt either was far too good for me, and I daresay she would not have had a gift of me.

And you won't persist in rejecting me, Kirsten dearest, not when I make it clear to you that it is you yourself who have put it in my power to address you thus now.

All the same, I should have been forced to think many times before I ventured to call them my children if you had not provided for them by your love and labour.
