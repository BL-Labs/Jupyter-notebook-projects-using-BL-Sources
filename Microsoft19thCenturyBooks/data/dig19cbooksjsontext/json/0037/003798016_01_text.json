I had not intended to have made any prefatory remarks ; but on consideration, I have thought some observations may be ac ceptable by way of introducing the subject ; and leading the mind towards the subject proposed to be considered. We may all at some one period or other of our lives recol lect, asking ourselves the question of, what is the law or au thority upon which human actions proceed, in regard to what is esteemed or approved, and the contrary. I say we all, who have ever reflected, or philosophically reflected on the moral proceed ings of man, recollect this question which very naturally occurs in our considerations. Why do we regard others in our actions, or consider we have duties, instead of acting just as the dictates of our own wants, desires, or caprice, may induce us, especially where the power or opportunity offers ? Philosophically considering the subject, I trust I have so far explained it satisfactorily on facts, to be found, in the moral nature, or constitution of man. That the consideration of the subject is called for, we need but mention one general case, in the law of nature, so called, that of all the soundest writers, and men most to be looked up to, in order to explain and justify the moral course and govern ment of men, one and all referring to the law of nature, find it necessary to qualify it, and do qualify it, but with that course that is found to be practicable for the human good. Is this a law or authority to the human understanding, that renders an appeal to that very understanding, to give it form and sanction for his acceptance. Why sure it is in that very under standing appealed to, that is the law that directs and authorizes man in whatever he does. Let us therefore enquire of it, let us"], [8, "PREFACE. VI see what it discovers to guide us, and what facts and truths offer for this purpose. It is on this consideration, I appeal to the human judgment, as the law of man ; and I trust I shall make it appear a truth no one can deny, and that laid before men all must see, and hence that we may arrive at a more intelligible and rational phi losophy, in regard to human proceedings. Professing a philosophical disquisition, it may be considered that I ought not to introduce cases of the times, and existing institutions ; but confine myself to the discussion of the subject proposed only in Theory or Principle. The reference, however, to matters the theory applies to, is, we consider, not out of cha racter with the subject, because it refers to a matter of existence, in present objects and institutions. The institution we specially advert to, as the means of afford ing the admonition and instruction of men, on the proper course of life, and duties for observance in what is good, has one and the same object, in effect, of the matter here discussed in Theory or Principle, as depending on men, or what we term morals, and is the purpose of shewing what Rights are, as the rule of direction derived from the means possessed by the being man, the subject of consideration in such object. In this respect both the institution and matter discussed are correspondent in office, and in no way is it conceived, can any subject be more appropriate, therefore, to be considered as a matter connected with that of the dis quisition. We have only abstained from entering more into other matters of practice, and application of the moral law and rule, or their effect, because involving too large a sphere ; and other matters that it is more discreet, we conceive, to consider by themselves, namely, matters of civil government and legislation, than in volve the discussion of the Theory and Principle of the subject of the moral law and rule of men, with those subjects."], [9, "CONTENTS.

ON THE LAW OF THE HUMAN JUDGMENT, etc. ARGUMENT I. THE JUDGMENT CONSIDERED AS THE LAW OF HUMAN DIRECTION. The great improvement in the moral world is probably from man becoming through time, accident, and study, the creature more of his moral powers, considering as such his reason and the faculties of mind, from the application of these to the discernment of what is truly wholesome and beneficial in regard to his objects and actions in what may be dependent on them ; instead of the moral powers being applied to aid or promote his passions, his desires and senses, and preconceived notions and prejudices. Men, both rude or uncivilized, and civilized, or the subject of refinement in kindness and humanity, are creatures of mind and reason, as necessarily must be the case, possessing those faculties which are the characteristics of man ; and therefore the subject of its aid, power, and influence. But in the former case man is the subject more of his mere animal nature, his brute passions and instincts, assisted and influenced by his intellect, which, un less cultivated by moral reflection, will serve to aid, promote, and aggravate them even to violence, and prejudice, and destruction ; while in the latter, man is the subject more of the reflecting powers of his intellect. The mind and reason being rather ap plied to direct and controul him in truly moral objects, or matters congenial to his being, or his good, discoverable by his powers of enquiry, investigation, and reason ; as a creature, nevertheless, of passions and desires, although rendering them subservient, or subjugating them to reason for the purpose of his moral good, and regarding his feelings, passions, and desires, only as they are of good, and in what is healthful or wholesome for the being or creature man. The law or rule of his moral powers or mind in di recting him is our enquiry."], [20, "2 THE JUDGMENT The greater improvement may have, or probably has, proceeded from the use of letters, which since the introduction of printing has more universally diffused knowledge, and men become acquainted with truths and facts not before brought under consideration, or that have not been before known to them as a matter of general knowledge, whatever may have been the acquirements or con siderations of individuals. This may have arisen from letters, as they afford the facile means of recording and transmitting the truth, or more correct knowledge ; and thus communicating gene ral knowledge and information to mankind. Men, in their enquiries and considerations on moral matters, do not appear to me ever to ask themselves what is the law, or au thority for what they do or esteem, or the contrary what they condemn or reject as concerning themselves. The want of doing which, appears to me the great occasion of diversity of opinion, and prevents a more settled or certain course of men in their opi nions, and their conduct, or clear ideas being entertained by them in moral matters. The fact is, the powers and faculties of men, as to mind, act so readily and spontaneously, the enquiry what that law is, on which they act, never occurs to them. The power that directs men is the moral power, the mind, the reason, reflection, judgment, and all those qualities of the mind we call the intellectual faculties of man. The moral power of man as his mind, and all its component parts and faculties, with regard to its decision or direction we may call the judgment, meaning the judgment of a reasonable being. The human judg ment, therefore, is this law or authority for what men do morally, or, on the authority of his moral powers or judgment, what man does is sanctioned or directed. This law or authority of man is that law we refer to in saying men do not ask themselves what is their law. It is a simple enquiry, the calling his attention to which, I think, may be of the very greatest service. For it is a want of attention to his authority that unquestionably makes a man doubtful and unsettled in all points of morals, whether of question or not, as to difficulty or mere matter of opinion ; apparently not aware where or to what he is to ascribe his sanction for what he does. I do not mean to say that knowing his law will be the means of setting"], [21, "CONSIDERED AS LAW. 3 him right in all he has to investigate and decide on, and has daily and reiteratedly to do, and what may be relatively in ac cordance or consistent with the object his judgment approves; for in this he must always be the subject of the fallibility of his powers of discernment, and those causes which exist in his animal nature \u2014 of his passions and desires, inclinations and self-love, where his interests are opposed to those of others. It matters not that his judgment may be mistaken as to what is right, it is enough he considers it right, or approves it, for the moral or intent of the being to do right, and it is all that he can do, when he so considers it, as to the act done. But I shall make further observations on this afterwards in considering the judg ment to be the law or authority of man. I beg leave, therefore, to call the attention of my reader in the present work to the subject of the judgment being the law or au thority to man ; and to the application of this principle for his direction, and which will be the consideration of these pages. It appears to me that in making free enquiry, the moral powers may be directed to human concerns and relationships without di recting such enquiry to the power, or it occurring to us to ask, what is the power, that is acting in the enquiry made, and is the law or authority for men to adopt that discerned to be right, or supposed to be so in those enquiries relative to the subject they are made on, and which subject as it concerns themselves, we term morals. The power acting spontaneously of itself, as the faculties of the mind and reason applied to any subject do, such direct or decide men according to what they discover, and appears right, and is approved accordingly in the object of their pursuit or enquiry, or in that subject to which these moral powers and faculties are applied. Men, therefore, proceed and act in the use of these moral powers, and use them as the means of their decisions without adverting particularly to them, as that power, which because it does decide, is the law for what they esteem or do. They cannot doubt this authority if they reflect a moment, and consider when they do refer to the mind and reason to discern and decide what is right, and do approve that accordingly, that it is by such power they do approve, and because approved, they do ; and that what is so approved and done, is on the authority b2"], [22, "4 THE JUDGMENT of such power. Few men we suspect, at first, without considera tion, will be disposed to admit reason to be their primary law, or any thing more than an auxiliary power to promote some as sumed authority considered their law. Put the question to those who may never have considered the subject, notwithstanding they may say I act or judge by my reason, he will not admit his rea son is his law ; but will refer to something beside his reason, and refer to a rule or principle that he considers is law, prior to his reason, and that his reason is only as an accessory to aid or assist what is discernible, agreeable to that supposed law. A man says this or that act is honest or just, reason tells him it is so \u2014 he buys goods of another under the pledge of payment, to pay him, therefore, reason tells me is right and just ; but he would not an swer the question, is reason your law then ? that his reason is his authority. But would answer, it is the principle or rule of honesty, and reason only tells him that to pay for his goods was according to that rule ; and that the rule, not reason, was his law or authority for paying his tradesman, and reason only points out the act ac cording to the law. He evidently considers, in this case, the in termediate action of his reason of finding or deciding what is agreeable to his rule, but does not scan on what his rule is found ed. Now that we call honesty, itself, and the rule appealed to in this case, is founded on reason. What is it but reason approving a return for a service, and admitting a debt due for that provided by another as a mode by which justice is done to those serving us, and the good of men is to be or can be respected or regarded. Honesty is but a term to a mode of action, or to fair and just dealing commonly applied to dealings in trade between men, but generally for all good service, and requital for such ; and a rule to refer, to mark or describe an action right, and which should be observed. The reason applied to paying a debt, therefore, as ho nest, is only the intermediate application of it to that in accordance with the rule honesty, but the rule is the immediate law or rule, sanctioned or authorized by what other authority of man, let us ask, than reason, in the application of his moral faculties, to dis cern or point out what is a rule for human good. Or take any other principal law or rule for man's direction, as truth, or charity, or what is termed honour, which is no more"], [23, "5 CONSIDERED AS LAW. than high sense of obligation to do what is right. Truth is as common or well known a law or rule for men to adhere to, or observe, as can be referred to. On reflection, men approve of truth as a rule, important for men's good, and their conduct towards one another ; it is a precept adopted by the virtuous among all men, and all nations, and referred to as a correct rule, to be observed by all men. It is a rule required to be observed in matters of laws, and in the administration of law for justice, brought to the decision of the law. It is, moreover, a precept of the Christian religion, and of all other religions, as a matter required for the virtuous ; and those guilty of the contrary, are considered reprobates, and base, and are condemned as bad. We may look on truth, as a more universal law, or rule, for men's observance, and better known than almost any other. But men will not, without consideration, on first being asked what is the authority, ascribe the adoption of truth as a law, to the primary law of reason. That reason discerning the good, or ser vice to man in it as a rule of observance, therefore approves, and adopts it ; and thence, although a precept or rule of itself to direct men, the law or authority for its adoption is dependent on his reason for approving it, being good, or beneficial for man. A man says, I speak truth as a virtue, or adhere to, or relate facts, however unpleasant or disagreeable in consequence, or to my own prejudice, because truth is held to be a law that is estimable, and because reason tells me to speak, or represent falsely, is not agreeable to that law of truth ; but I don't here refer to the truth as my law, because reason approves it, but because it is a law so received, and considered as such by men. And a man would say this, without reflecting that the judgment, approving the truth itself for the good of men, is, in fact, the primary law or authority for adopting it as the rule ; and, therefore, that his reason, approving truth, is the law of man in adopting or observing it. But, suppose that reason should reject, or not approve of truth, as a rule to be observed by men, would men adopt it ? Do men, under consideration, approve or adopt any rule, act, or thing, that their reason does not approve ? The answer is plain, they do not ; and certainly, . they would not adopt then truth,"], [24, "6 THE JUDGMENT without being approved. But reason approves it for its good, and, therefore, adopts truth as a law. The want of recognizing the moral powers, more immediately, as the law or authority with man, is probably the occasion of much doubt and error in men's minds, and the occasion that men hitherto, in making free enquiry in moral concerns, appear to be unsettled, or want authority for the conclusions they arrive at, for their better and more perfect sanction and justification. And free inquiry seems to leave men without rule or sanction, merely considering their reason as an intermediate power, or property, to direct them, according to some known rule or law, which has superiority or preference, and to which it is only accessory. The want, too, of considering the moral power of man, in its proper light, may be the true cause why further improvement in the state of man, has not progressed more than it has, after the light and intelligence of men's minds, from inquiry and know ledge, has proceeded as far as it has, in arts and sciences, and philosophy generally ; all knowledge throwing light on moral philosophy. But has it never occurred to men in their reflections, that if men use their faculties of mind and reason for their in quiry, discernment and direction, such must be that law which does primarily rule them, and is their authority. What is it else that tells men they approve, and act because they approve? They may wrongly approve, it is true, but such is only for want of better knowledge ; and these very powers of direction, may shut them out from this, by instituting rules in ignorance ; or in preconceived notions, not founded in fact, or for want of due in vestigation of any case or subject. At the same time, fallible as they may be, his moral powers are those he must depend on for decision ; and our business is, to enquire and to obtain that know ledge of them as the law or authority of man ; or in other terms, to exhibit the law of the human judgment, and its mode of acting in approval ; and its direction as applied to man, in giving him rights, which are, in fact, the mere approval of the good, but on which proceeds all human estimations, in regard to what he does, or is justified in, and the contrary, or what he rejects and depre cates."], [25, "7 CONSIDERED AS LAW. But men appear, for want of a due knowledge, or proper esti mate of their law or authority, and the rule of direction it gives them, to be unsettled in their principles and ideas ; or rather, for want of enquiry and investigation of their moral powers, in the moral world \u2014 or in regard to men themselves, in judging what relates to, or concerns man himself \u2014 they do not see, or they overlook their authority in the moral power itself. Thus, if men considered the respect of human life was due to all men, in their rights, yet did not reflect their reason gave them those rights, in approving what was good, and reason was the law or authority, therefore, for their rights, and giving their rights, they would not see their rights were dependent on their reason, as their law and authority, but would suppose their rights derived from some other ground or cause, as nature for instance, which is the general idea : and they would refer to their reason only as a means, shewing or pointing out their rights, as drawn from, or given by their nature, and consider reason only as an auxiliary or accessory means, to promote or aid in pointing out where our respect was to be shewn to human life, but not as their law which they would hold to be nature ; and they would not consider or esteem their reason as this authority or law. But if they consider, or see, or it is shewn to them, that reason, in approving their good, gives them their rights, or what is the same thing, that their rights are their good, and are therefore, approved, and rest upon, or depend, or derived from the discernment of their reason, \u2014 that good is that consistent, or in accord with man, and his benefit or welfare, and, therefore, approving it ; \u2014 then, they see and know, or admit the fact of their moral powers, in their reason and judgment giving them their rights, and which are, therefore, the law and authority for them ; and they do appreciate their moral powers as their authority. Thus it is seen men may, and as they most unquestionably do, without due reflection, consider their reason as only an auxiliary to shew or point out their rights ; the law, or authority of which, is considered to be in nature, instead of viewing their reason as the law and authority of their rights, which, in fact and truth it is, and not nature that is such authority. Besides then, a correct knowledge of our subject, which we arrive at and hope to show most satisfactorily, in morals as to its"], [26, "8 THE JUDGMENT law or authority. Attaining this knowledge of the law or au thority, and rendered plain and evident in this enquiry to all men of the most common capacity, men no longer remain unsettled in their opinions, but are assured and satisfied of their authority in their reason, for their justification, as far as rests with them as moral beings. But there appears, at the time of writing these lines, a great change or working, in the moral world, as relative to human notions or ideas, and modes of acting as concerning themselves. I should say it appears in men, acting more according to the de cision of their moral powers in their reason and judgement applied considerately in free enquiry. Which powers by knowledge have become more expanded, and enquiring into the subjects of concern to men, act on a conviction of what their judg ment sees and discerns, is right or consistent with, a reasonable, or supposed reasonable object and purpose ; and evidently in so doing, referring to the moral powers of the judgment in what they do, as their sanction. But yet, probably, not adverting to that power as their rule or law for adopting, what they do, or act ing as they do ; but only considering it a means of finding out, examining, or ascertaining what accords with a principle or object they have in view to direct them ; which is rather considered as their law, than their reason or judgment approving what they do. But why they make this enquiry, and why they adopt what their judgment decides is right in regard to their object in such en quiry, is clearly on their judgment, which is therefore the law or rule of government or direction. That such an effect, and of the character as alluded to, of change in the moral world, is exemplified in relation to the laws and institutions of the country. The recent alterations and amelioration of the laws in their severity in many cases on moral grounds, and not so much on policy, is an instance ; new views of policy in laws relative to trade and commerce ; alterations in the constitution of the legislature or government, are all instances of free enquiry and changes in men's ideas and opinions ; and the views of many on the subject of religion, and especially on the subject of the established religion of the country, and the insti tution of tithes, are further instances. Whether the decisions of"], [27, "CONSIDERED AS LAW. 9 their judgment in these several respects are right is not a question here, but it exemplifies a change or alteration of men's ideas, and that is passing at this day of a great and entire alteration from former notions and ideas entertained on these subjects. The cor rectness or not of men's ideas and judgment, we will not pretend to judge here. But it arises from an enquiry made into these matters, and the decision of men's judgments, and thus acting through these their moral powers. But if they have misjudged, and more especially in these matters and laws, which relate more to moral good and evil, I think it very possible, nay probable, to have originated from not considering their judgment rightly, and as their law ; but rather as a means of discerning and determin ing what is agreeable or not to a supposed object considered to be right, or a preconceived notion, or rule of action which is their guide, and their reason subservient to effect it ; rather than as the law itself of men, and their primary agent to direct and go vern them. And which, was their judgment considered to be the law, might decide very differently in many points or concern ing the authority men have upon various matters and things, and occasions, to the decisions and determinations they arrive at for want of considering it law ; but merely as accessary to rules of direction they .consider as obligatory, which their moral power of reason and judgment are to effect, or compass, to the best of their discernment, but not considering their reason as the prim ary law, but merely as auxiliary. It is my object to draw the attention of man to the considera tion of the moral powers of his mind, his reflection, his reason, and judgment, by which he does inquire into and investigate all actions and things as concern or relate to himself, and the sub ject of his power or agency, and judges and decides accordingly as such things and actions agree or not, to be right or the con trary ; and which he therefore approves, and adopts, and rejects the contrary, and which directing him as his direction or autho rity in all he does, in his law or rule. And that, seeing the moral powers are his authority, and not merely considering his moral means as in aid or an accessary or auxiliary to his good, he will be more settled and certain in his conduct to further the real object with man, that of the good and benefit of all man-"], [28, "10 THE JUDGMENT kind as far as rests with man to promote and effect it. I must consider that the want of this inquiry into the moral world, and not making this distinction has been the cause of all the con fusion, and uncertainty, and want of satisfaction to men's minds in their moral considerations. The more important subject respecting morals and the moral o-overnment of men, which affords an instance in the change tak ing place in the moral world, is that of religion, not only relative to the church establishment of the country, but to the opinions of men upon the subject of religion itself, as an appendage or component part of government, and which most probably is the occasion of the modern prevailing sentiment of disregard shewn towards the system of an established religion, and the establish ment. On the subject of religion, and religion as connected with the moral powers or peculiar nature of man, and the institution of government and the laws, as I view the subject, is of great in terest to men, and that it calls for peculiar consideration, especi ally in a work professing to treat on the moral law or authority, and its power, influence, and direction in the attainment of that object, common to all men, of their welfare or good ; and which good can never be complete to a moral or contemplative being without religion. And which, I therefore, advert to, that it may not be supposed, in the consideration of the moral law or authority to man it is to discharge the mind from the consideration of religion, or to throw aside the dependence of man in that respect. I consider the necessity of an established or state religion, because man is a religious being, and as such, religion has ever been found to be, or form, part of his institutions of government and laws. And forming part of the institution of government, the moral object of which must be considered to be the instruction and enjoining on men what are the rules and conduct of life for his good, and especially in their duties. And the business of the ministers of religion, is giving this instruction of moral duty, as enjoined or sanctioned by religion. And lastly, I shall show that the human mind, as affected by or applied to external ob jects and things, creates or pictures to itself necessarily the sub ject of religion, that is, that the moral powers or peculiar nature"], [29, "11 CONSIDERED AS LAW. of man necessarily raise up the subject of religion and render man a religious being, and that it is necessary for his happiness as a reflecting, moral, or reasonable being ; and consequently that existing in the moral nature of man it is requisite to be recog nised, admitted, or acknowledged in all human concerns and in stitutions ; and it only remains to consider, in what way religion can be viewed agreeable to the moral powers, or the idea man can have of it, agreeable or consistent with reason. In allusion to the change or great action taking place in men's minds in the moral world, the inquiring powers of man lead him to ask whether the use and service of religion cannot be rendered to mankind, without adopting religion, as an institution of the state ; and in these days of a more enlightened philosophy, in a more extended or liberal consideration of all mankind, to ask, is the constitution of religion in the state a requisite part of the establishment ? And by it, is not an hardship imposed on every subject who may not accord with the contituted form of religion adopted by the state ? These form plausible questions and con siderations, in which I shall endeavour to satisfy those who will favour me with their attention in perusing what I have to say upon this point. .It would be folly to deny that abuses may grow up in a state religion, as in the state itself, and in all human institutions. Such undoubtedly may be the case. Examples, too, of the great and neighbouring state of France, and of a new constituted form of government in the states of America, hold forth in prac tice the dispensing with religion as an establishment of the state. The rapid advances of science and knowledge, by the aid of printing, may have induced the body of the people, where in telligence has spread, to suppose, that the degree of information they have arrived at is sufficient for the moral direction of men and its perpetuation, without the aid of a state religion. All these circumstances will combine tp make men think that religion is no longer a requisite to form part of the constitution of a state or government, or the laws ; and, therefore, that a church establish ment may fearlessly be laid aside, as an ingredient of the con stituted form of government. But I consider these ideas have grown up from considering"], [30, "12 THE JUDGMENT the abuses and perversion of religion ; and that in such states as may dispense with it as a state establishment ; that those who think it may be dispensed with, have acted and think, more from the abuse of the subject as a component part of a state, than with foresight to its use ; and that they will have to learn their error, if they have not already had a foretaste in the want of an established institution, to steady the modes of thinking in morals as well as on the subject of religion itself; and the evils and in conveniences are felt attending the want of an acknowledgment of religion in one country ; and the mind diverging into all the fanciful extravagancies of the imagination of ignorant men in putting their construction on the bible, is felt in the other. With the evidence of the constitution of man before us, I shall not stop to make inquiries as to the effects or consequences felt in either of these countries, or conjectures for the future. The moral nature of man is that of a religious being, however a perverse and mistaken philosophy may deny it, taking advantage of the abuses and impostures introduced into religion, to promote their doctrines ; but which doctrines can only prevail for a time. That man is a religious being, is eminently exemplified in all history, or account of man, from the most primeval and ignorant states of man, afforded by history ; and the danger to man, is only here, as in all other cases relating to man, the danger of error, of ig norance, and abuse, which he is liable to fall into. And I con ceive it would be a most desirable service, rendered to mankind, if a system of instruction could be afforded, that would keep him free of errors, as to the main object of all religion, and of all mankind ; unless where perverted in their reasoD, or by prejudices imbibed in education, as strongly affecting them while they prevail. My object and hope is, to shew that moral principles, or that rule of action, we are enabled to arrive at in duly considering the object with all mankind of good, is the same with pure religion : that all mankind in reason, and of necessity, must approve of the institution of pure religion. Whatever be their particular faith or persuasion, that on the undeniable fact of man being a reli gious being in his moral nature, it is a necessary ingredient in his institutions. That it will be in vain to exclude it while this"], [31, "13 CONSIDERED AS LAW. nature of man exists. That Christianity is this in effect, namely, the same as that idea of a pure religion men morally arrive at. \u2014 And that a pure moral philosophy is a rule and doctrine attained by human power, that is, corresponding and perfectly in unison with that of pure religion in Christianity ; and that in moral phi losophy pure religion receives an aid in its correspondence with the moral or peculiar nature of man, in what that points out, and that the moral good is supported by religion. And we shall hope to regain the most hardened and inveterate dissenters from the sacred subject, by the undeniable doctrine on what is the true course and object of man to pursue in life, established by a true philosophy with regard to man ; and that as man is a religious being in his nature, which must enter into all his institutions, and those of the state in particular, that Christianity according with true philosophy, is that to be maintained : but if abuses have grown up, or may grow up, in it, such are matters for correction ; but not of reformation here ; as that has already taken place in the Church of this country. Moral philosophy is purely treated of, therefore, by me, for these purposes ; and as what rests on facts has a foundation, or base to stand on, that cannot be denied. I shall hope to lay before mankind facts, that all must subscribe to, as science and knowledge spreads, for what is founded on truth must spread, and be received, when ascertained and made known. Religion, like all other subjects, is liable to be abused, under the ignorance, mistakes, and fallibilities of human nature ; and, consequently, such, no doubt, had grown up in Christianity, from the primitive doctrines of its first teachers, ceasing, in the course of nature, with their offices ; and it becoming the subject of an esta blished and political power, in the Church of Rome. The policy which extended its influence- over Europe, was in the spreading the religion, to spread subjection to the supreme head, raised in the pontifical seat ; and subject the universe under religion, to the supremacy of Rome. However successful under ignorance and delusion, it was a system that human nature could not con tinue under, without revolting at, and the abuses and impostures practised under it, at length, led to the Reformation. And the Protestant Established Church of this country, is no more nor less"], [32, "14 THE JUDGMENT than Christianity disabused from the abuses grown up in it by time. So that the Christian religion, like governments, laws, and all other institutions, subject to the interference and direction of men, is liable to be abused. Such, no doubt, was the occasion of the reformation ; and which has left us with the Protestant Established Church of this day, which may be considered as pure Christianity, disabused of the errors, and impostures, and delu sions that had grown up in it. The establishment of a state religion being necessary, the point for consideration what is to be, or can be adopted, can be but the matter of a moment. That in existence, under the light of phi losophy, as most congenial to man, Christianity, alone, has the pre-eminent claim : but that likewise, which is consistent with the rule that is requisite to be observed by men for good, in the re spect and consideration of all men, in the Christian words, of \" peace on earth, and good will towards men,\" and which, of need, must be subscribed to by all men, for the good or benefit of all mankind, is that, the doctrines of which all mankind must conform to ; and so far agreeable to all religions whatever, that have in them the object of good, and the respect and consideration of men by one another. This is certainly the case with the Protestant Established Church, in point of doctrine and practice, and to which, there fore, all religions do subscribe and conform, having the good of man in view ; and the formula or ceremony of worship will be the only difference ; and to this, each may be left to itself, as the more correct mode may appear to them of the religion they indi vidually profess, except where inconsistent with good morals, or not operating to the good of man. I speak advisedly, surely, will be allowed me, when I say reli gion is a principle of the oldest institutions of man; because religion, whether Christian, or otherwise, has always been a part of, may I say an ingredient of system, or institution of govern ment, or the laws and rules of people for the order and governing of them. Religion, then, is a matter that has found its way into all human institutions of the law or government. There must be, therefore, I consider, a nature, a propensity, in man towards the"], [33, "15 CONSIDERED AS LAW. subject to raise, and incorporate it with his most important insti tutions for the human welfare, in government or law. The druids of our country, the same of Gaul, the priests of the temples of the heathen gods of Greece and Rome, the priests of the pagan nations, whether of Asia or Africa, the priests of the refined Indians of Mexico, Peru, and the Thascalans, the priests of the wild Aborigines of North America, the priests of the more modernly discovered primitive races of the Pacific Ocean, are an historical evidence of facts, that religion enters into the institutions of the laws and government of man, inde pendent of the divine authority which we acknowledge in Chris tianity. There must be, therefore, in such evidence, a nature in man, raising up his mind towards, and seeking and requiring the inter vention of religion in human institutions, and for his assistance, and we must necessarily assume, for his good or welfare. It offers, at this time more especially, an opportunity to con sider the subject of a state establishment of religion. Whatever may be the opinions of men in religions, yet man prone in bis moral nature to be a religious being, requires the attention of government towards it, to lead or direct, and even restrict men to such a view or consideration, that shall not be opposed to the laws, and good of mankind, and the state. And it is, moreover, incumbent for the moral instruction of society, that religion should be taught. How can youth be instructed ; how can the thoughtless, many of them grown up, and busy in pleasure, and daily avocations, and labours, be reminded of their moral duties, but by public religious instruction. By moral inquiry, and by the establishment of what is the moral law, we shall find the authority of the moral law fully esta blishes the laws and rules of human government. And I submit, that the government of any country or people, be its religion what it may, must, for the protection and maintenance of the rights of men, uphold and act upon the moral law ; and if the established religion of any country, or the various religions of any country, do not do this, they must be limited or restrained in what must be considered the errors of men in their religions ; in order to do justice, and respect the rights of the subjects,"], [34, "16 THE JUDGMENT being the object for which every government, and all laws are raised and maintained ; therefore, the religion of every state must be qualified, where opposed to the good and happiness, and necessities of men, and the state, whenever such happens to be the case; or men must suffer injustice and wrongs, where the moral law is not respected, or its plain and evident rules are not regarded, and made the law of human conduct, and the rule of government and laws, in their dispensations to those, for whose good and protection they are instituted. If the established church of this country is in doctrine and principle, as regards the duties of men towards each other, in conformity with the moral law, the question, I think, is answered for this country. It is a religion which is instituted, and which, in conformity with the moral law, government, viewed as a human institution, must adopt for the moral government and direction of the sub jects, in that public instruction required in all states, for the in forming the minds of the people. And it has, I contend, the peculiar claim, as being the established religion of the state, and of being that moral instruction, and that moral law required to be observed by all men, and the object of all government and law for the maintenance and protection of the rights of men, and justice to all ; and which all the subjects must subscribe to, in the support of government, for justice and protection, and the rights of all men. All religions may be tolerated, but all religions must subscribe to the moral law, for the respect of rights, and not respecting which, inflict injustice and wrongs on men. What are the principles promoted by the moral law ? Let us see whether they are not what every man must agree to, and observes, to do good ; or otherwise, wrong and injustice must be the results ; the moral law is the authority for the rights of all men to their good, and imposes the duties on men of respect and consideration for one another. As modes or measures for this, it gives men their moral precepts, as in their dealings and trans actions between men, it requires truth and honesty, and in their judgments and opinions towards each other, charity, mercy, patience and benevolence. In their private conduct and de-"], [35, "CONSIDERED AS LAW. 17 meanor, temperance, chastity, generosity, and the practice of virtue generally. And as subjects, obedience to the government and laws. My design is to exhibit that the ideas men arrive at on the moral authority, or through their judgment and reason, agree with the duties of religion of the Established Church of England. To prove to men and satisfy their minds that the duties required of man by religion in regard to their conduct, are practically no other than those which accord with reason and so according, are those which are sanctioned by the means moral, or rational, men have to direct them. To confirm, therefore, to men by the testi mony of their own judgment, the duties enjoined by religion to wards one another, are in accordance with the best investigation they can give the subject of morals as reasonable beings, and to induce men, therefore, both by religion, and their own discern ment and reason, to regard and follow what is moral and good ; and to satisfy the most conscientious that there is nothing at va riance between the religion of the Established Church and the judgment of men as to the law or rules of their conduct, will be my endeavour to exhibit to, and satisfy, every reasonable being. The purity of the Established Church, with the duties in re gard to its conformity to reason, can only be ascribed to the doc trines of faith, being combined with works ; understanding faith in God as regards men, applies to what is good according to the moral esteem or discernment of men enjoined or required by works ; meaning our acts in observance or performance of that good discernible to, and resting with, men. Such is unquestion ably the test of the truth of that which should be in accordance with the powers of discernment and judgment of the creatures it is designed to instruct and command, which if inconsistent with, it would always be at variance with his means of direction in his reason, and those very means it has pleased the Creator to en dow the being with. The day is past when it can be attempted by other means than by reason, to controul and satisfy men of the law and authority for their conduct. It is necessary to make the law and authority for their conduct apparent and conformable with reason. The c"], [36, "18 THE JUDGMENT moral law is this, and which we have endeavoured to shew and establish, and to have efficacy with reasonable and enlightened men, both religious duties and morals must be rendered in con formity with the reason and comprehension of men. If we see religion invariably accompanying the moral being in that which particularly characterizes him as such, as in that pro ceeding from him in the character of his moral constitution, in his reflections and considerations, and mixed up with his institu tions and his actions, it is surely not to be denied that there is an affinity with, and need in such subject for that being. It will be utterly in vain that men shall strive against it, to exclude the subject of religion from his thoughts. Derived from, bred, as it were, in his own peculiar nature, arise it always will, and can never be extinguished. And I contend therefore, that religion is a subject to be recognized by governments and laws for the protection of men, in that subject the creation of their moral or peculiar nature essential for their consolation, happiness, and welfare ; and to regulate and promote it, as depending on men ; as much or the same as any other subject in which the good of men is concerned. Civil laws may not enter into the faith or thoughts or consider ations of men in regard to religion ; but so far as religion is a sub ject of the moral agency of man, it may be a subject of laws to guard and protect them in : and as laws may give aid and assist ance to protect and promote that subject, so they may give their aid to restrain and correct any extravagances of men, or offensive or obnoxious proceedings of men, in the subject affecting the welfare and happiness of men. So far may Government and law take cognizance of religion, and may therefore regulate and promote it the same as any other matter or subject affecting or of concern to men. The prevalent religion of a nation as a distinct people, will be that probably found in adoption by the state or government*, and referred to in its solemn ceremonies, and appeals to the Deity to give sanction to, and to cause to prosper its undertakings, and * History attests this fact, and by conquerors in remote ages imposing their own, and denouncing that of the nation or people subjugated."], [37, "19 CONSIDERED AS LAW. where a general uniformity of faith and opinion prevails, this may be unobjectionable to a people. But in these days of free enquiry, and licence entertained in regard to the subject, it appears to be a question raised, whether a state religion can be maintained without injustice to that portion of the people who may or do not agree in that religion adopted by the state ; inasmuch as they are bound to contribute to the pay ment in support of it, and to conform to some of its forms or ceremonies, or suffer the penalties or disadvantages of noncon formity. This spirit or feeling of liberal consideration is carried, in the present day, so far, as not only to oppose or object to a state religion as differing in its general nature or character, but to slight differences in points of faith, and as to forms and ceremo nies in themselves of trivial nature. So that, although the mass may generally agree in one faith, as in Christianity, yet mere sectarists lay claim to a separate consideration, and urge the hardship and injustice of thus being obliged to contribute, and submit to an Established Church, its support, and its forms and ceremonies, and certain solemnities observed in the institution of the government and laws, or required, in conformity with it. This is an objection, \u2014 if admissible, which I do not consider it to be, \u2014 to all established religion, and would operate as such to a denial of the good of religion to man ; therefore I do not see how it can be regarded without totally abandoning the subject of the good of men in this respect, by the law or government. But, as I have observed, as it is in the peculiar nature of man morally constituted, as he is, to be a religious being, and to have this his regard and matter essential for his happiness, welfare, and good, promoted and protected, as any other matter of moral regard, re quired for his good and welfare in reason, this, the abandonment of the subject by government, cannot be sanctioned, nor in policy is it desirable to subscribe to it. To meet the subject morally considered, or as a subject ame nable to the moral powers of men, their discrimination and judgment, and as the subject can be treated dependent on them as reasonable beings, I shall offer a few observations on the re formed religion of protestantism as established in this country, to point out the establishment as meeting the objections alluded to. c2"], [38, "20 THE JUDGMENT If the considerations I have to offer, are met under a liberal con struction or view, which I claim for it equally to be considered with the liberality of opinion or treatment required by the oppo nents of the establishment, I shall not despair of convincing those at present opposed. I shall observe then, at once, that the Established Church of England is a professedly reformed religion. Reformed in what it is capable, by the best and most reasonable consideration men can give the subject, to be strictly in conformity with morality, and virtue, or what is good, as men can see and discern. The purest moral doctrines are the precepts and the law to be gleaned from Christianity ; and are the boast of its faith. This, in fact and truth, is the good of the creature man, as applied to the whole race, dependent with men, that is, on their powers of discernment and agency to effect it. And this is according to the discernment of a reasonable being, or the law which governs him, the object of his attainment, and rule of his direction. Why was our establishment called reformed, but on account of its being the act of man, in the best consideration, as a reasonable being, he, man, could give the subject. No other meaning can be applied to the word, reformed, or term, reformation, but the act of man. And why was it reformed ? or reformation required ? Because it was the opinion of men at that time that errors and abuses had grown up, that were contrary to the pure doctrine of the religion of Christianity, and called for the inter position of the legislature. I cannot suppose, as some persons seem to think, and I think shewing a weakness of such who do, that the change or reformation took place at the mere beck of the monarch on the throne at that day, even in the plenitude of means he possessed. He must have felt a confidence in the ge neral opinion to support the measure of reformation, and the ge neral opinion, and the act, shewed it was a measure of consider ation of men of what was best or right and required, upon the subject. To suppose otherwise would be to shake the Established Church to its foundation as a Church, though its moral doctrine would and must be imperishable, that being in the moral consti tution of men. In what the reformed religion consists, morally considered, in"], [39, "21 CONSIDERED AS LAW. truth and practice it may be stated as whatever the moral good consists of, or is to be found, in the discernment of man, and can be effected by human means ; and the doctrine of our Established Church, preached and taught, is as pure, moral good, as its respective preachers can discern and point out, to inculcate in practice to their hearers. I do not enter into any particular tenets, or any forms or cere- monies, as I am considering the moral view of religion, as rests with men, their powers of discernment, and means of achiev- ing. But I think I may aver, without fear of contradiction, that the tenets of the faith, are as simply pure as can be supposed or imagined by man, it is possible to have a faith in the divine au- thority, that is to sanction the moral proceedings of men ; or what rests with them to perform, as reasonable beings, according to the best of their discernment, and powers to execute. And as to the ceremonies, neither can it be well imagined a more pure or simple form can be adopted, than that of the Church, with acknowledg- ing the interposition of divine authority, and offering the worship or homage of the creature. But supposing a more pure or simple tenet of faith, or of forms and ceremonies, can be adopted, and such may be possible, is simplicity the character of those who dissent from the establishment ? Or is simplicity that on which they can claim title to on their part to oppose as an objection to the Established Church, or on which they suffer any hardship or injustice ? Or is there any dissenting portion of society that can boast, with reference to any tenets that can be regarded as possessing the divine nature of the Christian faith, a greater simplicity. And I allude to, as especially, as those supposed to be contrasts to the Established Church, the dissenters of the classes called Quakers, and Unitarians or Socinians. Is the one more simple in its forms or doctrines, or is the other possessed of claims of greater simplicity of its tenets, compatible with the di vine nature of religion ? Considering then the very unexceptionable nature of the Esta blished Church in any moral consideration of the subject, as far as man see, and judge, and the necessity of a national recognition of religion, in its support by legislative authority, what form can we refer to, less objectionable, requiring the general subscription"], [40, "22 THE JUDGMENT of a nation, under a moral view of the subject. It were much more exceptionable, to require a whole community to subscribe to the differences of a sect opposing the moral duties of men, than for such less portion to conform to the mass, and obey the moral law or duties of men, by conformity to the laws and institutions of the country for its maintenance. The moral object and justice of which is evident, which of necessity, are obligatory and bear equally on the whole community. For I speak not of partial bearings of laws and institutions, which, wherever existing, and can be altered without danger or worse evil attending the alter ation, than that endured under such, ought to be corrected. Were this not the case, to what difficulties would it lead to consider that in protecting and promoting religion with men, every varying or differing tenet or view of men on the subject of religion, or its forms or ceremonies, must be regarded ; and the law made to suit or conform to such. The impracticability of this shews the absurdity ; but yet this must be the case in every establishment, if the various sectarists or dissentients to such, are to be considered : for if one is to be regarded they all should, this is impracticable ; but therefore a form which all must agree in of necessity, for moral good, is that which all can submit to, or the alternative must follow that no establishment is to be main tained, because there are various tenets held, or sectarians and dissenters. At the same time that exceptions may be taken by every dif fering religion in faith or tenet, and form and ceremony, to the state religion of any country, the whole of society must be bound by the moral good ; and if that is made the practical doctrine of a state religion ; thus morally viewing the subject, or in that way or by that means men have the power to discern and discriminate and judge and determine, I confess I cannot admit the hardship or injustice done any men in requiring them to maintain such an establishment of the state, that shall be necessary to uphold re ligion: which is in truth, a divine authority, as the highest internal controul over men for that ; which for the good of man kind ought to be and must be regarded, to effect his good, and to promote and protect generally the subject of religion, which is required for human happiness, man in his nature and of necessity"], [41, "CONSIDERED AS LAW. 23 being religious, through his moral powers, or peculiar na ture. I feel confident, morally considering the subject, that what ever may be the distinction or difference of different religions, that in practical doctrine that, and that alone, which pure and true religion can intend and maintain, is the moral good ; and that is what men can see and discern is most accordant and con sistent, with the benefit of man, and at the same time practicable. For were it otherwise, it would be at variance, and not recon cileable with reason, the power or means the Creator has endued the creature man to direct him ; and in conformity with the de sign in that power, that he should follow that which it points out, and can approve ; which in reference to the being possessing it, and whose consideration it is applied to, must be that consistent with the subject considered, as the creature considering himself; reason being that which is seen to be agreeable to, or consistent with, the object considered, or it is applied to. Surely therefore it may be affirmed, that such being the case, generally considering the subject, that pure and true religion must accord with the moral good. No wrong or injustice can be alleged, or maintained, by any differing from the state esta blishment in being called upon to maintain the doctrine of moral good, and the promoting it, for which an established religion is required, and which cannot be promoted and protected on divine authority without religion; and that cannot be secured to men without the protection of law, and therefore raising or instituting such establishment. And the simplest tenet and form of religion will be that most proper or fit for a state religion, to give pro tection, and promote generally the subject of religion as a matter of necessity for the human good. What I mean to say is this, that the protection and promotion of religion must be at the hands of government and the laws, the same as any other good required by man ; that the promotion of moral doctrine on divine authority can only be by religion ; for this, a state religion is that which laws can only recognize as an institution, as it would be impossible for laws to maintain every varying form of religion ; that all religion must, to be pure, pro ceed on moral good for practical doctrine ; and this, I say, the"], [42, "24 THE JUDGMENT Established Church being of great simplicity of form and its practical doctrine that of moral good, and which, and the fact of its being professedly a reformed religion, is an establishment therefore best entitled to distinction as a state religion, and that which, morally considered, none can object to, because its doc trine is that moral good all society are bound by, and acknow ledge and practise, and which it is essential for the human welfare, to cultivate and promote, and be a man's faith, tenet, or formula, what they may ; for all must subscribe to what is just, and the only means of knowing this, is through the power of human dis cernment, which is by the moral powers man possesses or is con stituted with, and which approves of good as the rule of his direction. I am speaking on this subject merely as men have powers to view or consider it, and as far as the subject is comprehensible to mens' minds, or the moral powers ; and can therefore only refer to the subject as agreeable or according with the discernment of man under the best consideration that he can give it, for his guidance, and direction, in regard to it ; and such appears to me to be the case with respect to the reformed religion of the Church of England, and my views are those that I have taken of it. On the ground of religion being part of a state or government as an establishment for the instruction of the rule required of men for the moral good, and generally the duties of men towards each other. With respect to its maintenance, I shall observe gene rally, having provision and funds of its own, I contend it is no tax or charge on any member of the state, and no dissentient from it as to tenets or forms, on that ground, can with jus tice complain. Appropriate funds for an established religion is the only means by which such can be maintained, without charging those who are dissentient. But it will be said certain payments do not partake of this nature ; this may be admit ted in a degree ; but as far as those payments are matters of remuneration for partly secular duties and offices, as marriages, baptisms, and burials, matters necessary of state or legislative regulation, I think no objection is reasonably to be made on such account, and such are very trifling ; the rest are too trifling for notice here, speaking generally on the subject."], [43, "25 CONSIDERED AS LAW. Tithes, it will be contended by some, are an exception, to the position stated that the Established Church being maintained by its own funds is no charge on those who dissent from it, as under them the persons paying, or subject to them, and all payments in lieu of them, are a direct charge on the persons liable; and where such are dissenting from the religion of the state, such are charged for that they disapprove of, and that is unjust. I do not, however, admit the justice of this objection to tithes. But on other accounts, tithes in relation to a high and expensive mode of agriculture, may be objectionable ; but this is an ob jection to them on totally different grounds, viz., to that of their being considered as a payment for the land which may be op pressive under the circumstances of expensive cultivation, but is no objection to them as a charge paid by any dissentient from the Established Church. It may as well be said that lands rented, or rent paid for land or houses, is a charge of one man upon another, and an injustice or wrong. It might be carried further, and all payments de manded for goods and merchandize, might as well be alleged was a charge on one man for another, and unjust therefore. The pay ment of rent for land is like a requital or remuneration for goods or wares or merchandize, or benefits received, or wages or sala ries for labour or hire, or the products of labour, art, and in dustry ; and there is no distinction between the nature of one or the other, as a matter of remuneration and justice ; and the dis tinction is only in the difference of the article. For land is just as much the subject of property, and gain of labour and industry and service, as any other matter, and necessarily must be in all settled states or nations ; and therefore as a universal measure of proceeding among men, that payment or remuneration which must be made by one to another for goods or benefits received, there can be no question as to the good or justice of pay ment of rent for land, and the question for our purpose here must be assumed to be at rest; and I shall not after thus substan tiating the ground on which rents are sounded, deem it necessary further to consider this point. Tithes and tithe payment then, I consider purely but as a rent ; and in the nature of a return to be made in part for the"], [44, "2(5 THE JUDGMENT land held; and for the good or benefit conferred in that land, so far as a rent, and a remunerative return for land, as an interest in the land belonging to the Established Church ; I cannot see the injustice or oppression as a due considered as from one man to another, whose property is to be paid for if held or enjoyed by another, and benefits received from it. As a due then, there is no injustice or wrong. But in the nature, as to quantum or mode of definino- what the payment or rent to be made in the character of tithes, I think there may be objections, and which will not be otherwise than admitted, even by the best friends of the esta blishment, and the most interested in the mode of payment itself. In the common nature of rent a landlord, or the owner of pro perty, takes his share or part of the charges in respect of that, be it land, or be it in houses. He has his buildings and repairs to make, and charges on the labour, industry, and property of others bestowed upon it, to make it profitable, or yield a benefit. If he does not this by direct payment himself, he does so in the diminution of the rent he obtains, or can obtain where he does not directly contribute this portion, or share of charges. But a fixed share in the gross produce, and without contribution to any charge of producing the benefits from the land, or subject to any diminution on this account, places that on a different ground from the common nature of rent ; and it must be evident that a re munerative return for good received in the share or interest the tithe owner has in the land, thus modelled or assessed, may be come exceedingly onerous, and, in many instances, even swallow up all the compensation returnable from land, for the labour be stowed, and capital expended on it, in cost and charges attending it. And this is a point of view, in which surely the best and most conscientious men, and strongest advocates of the system, and those most interested in tithes, must admit is not supported by reason, or justice ; and never could be a matter contemplated in application to countries, where necessarily the improvements in agriculture can be effected only by great labour, and great outlay or capital, or where, from complicated policy arising from government and state charges, as taxes and debt, a large claim is held on all property. As a provision for the ministers of the church, without- drawing"], [45, "87 CONSIDERED AS LAW. them away from their callings in their ministerial offices or busi ness, the mode of drawing their subsistence from the land, with out the charge and occupation of their time in doing so, and with out rendering them chargeable on that account, there can be no question of the excellence of the provision. The only deficiency is, it allows not for the charges the society are liable to, in rais ing it, and, therefore, is at all times, an undue share ; and may be excessive in the case of the charge and culture upon the land to make it yield, and be profitable, or worth bringing into culti vation or rendering serviceable ; and it is too much to say that all land that can be cultivated, is not to be cultivated, because it will not bear, besides its other charges, a tenth of its whole pro duce to be taken away. As a brief example of what I state, let us take the case of the value of tithe under inclosures, and where a commutation is given in land for tithes. The ordinary quantity is, one-fifth of the arable, in some instances it is one-fourth, and this is said not to be equivalent to the tithe. In this case, one-fifth the value of tithe, or one-tenth of the produce of the land, doubles itself as the proportion of saving to the land owner in cultivation, and is the estimated amount of the charge, therefore to the tithe owners for cultivating it; and the proportion of cost to produce is just one half; that is, one tenth or half is sunk for outlay or charge to pro duce one-tenth the tithe or profit, or the return to the tithe owner; and the conclusion to be drawn is, that in arable land, the return or profit for the charge is one-half of the produce ; that is, the cultivator must expend in cultivation, including horses, carriages, implements, seed, corn, and labour, and taxes, and certain repairs, but exclusive of rent, what is equal to one half value of the produce, for the return of the other half \u2014 shew ing that paying taxes on agriculture, building, repairs, seed, corn, labour, manure, &c. but independent of rent, is equal to half the value of that raised \u2014 and, therefore, to give the value of one-tenth of the produce, or the equivalent of the tithes, the landowner must double it. It is therefore clear, that although the wheat crop might give an ample return, yet, as this cannot be continued, the other crops less profitable will not afford a re munerating return to the cultivator. The expense of manure"], [46, "28 THE JUDGMENT and preparing the land and seed, will not be so heavy for the barley and oats as the wheat, and one-fifth is too much for the cultivating these grains, but the one-fifth is taken as the whole round of expense for a series of three or four years, but if the barley and oats cost less in cultivating, the wheat costs more, and it is the average cost that is taken in calculating the allowance for commuting arable land. The farmer has, however, to con- tend with liability of bad crops and markets and various other matters, perhaps, that ought to be taken into the account, and the tithe owner, in commuting his tithe, must have two-tenths or one- fifth of the land. This is exclusive of rent, for no rent is paid to the land owner for that. By this statement it appears, that it requires half the value of that raised, or produced, to be ex- pended or laid out in raising the other half. Thus, the produce of agriculture, at this calculation, gives one-half of the whole raised as gain or produce of the land for the outlay in produc ing that \u2014 but in this, rent is not included. We have, therefore, to see what profit remains to the farmer or cultivator of arable land after paying or allowing to the owner of the tithes one-tenth of the produce. The produce gained free of cost and labour, in raising corn according to the commutation, gives for tithe of one-fifth of the arable computed as equal to one-half the value of that raised is next, to be estimated in regard to profit to the farmer or agriculturist, to see what is left, or what compensation he has after payment of his tithes or one-tenth of the produce. The remainder of the land, after deducting one-fifth for the tithe, is to bear the rent, land tax, poor rates, and assessed taxes of house, and all expenses of cultivation attendant on the business. Estimating the value of the produce by the tithe, as equal to the expenditure of cultivation and all attendant expenses of the far- mer, and adding the rent, and which the farmer will have to pay for the remainder of the land, and taking the rent at five times the value of the tithe, and suppose that to amount to 8*. per acre, the rent for the remaining four-fifths of an acre, tithe free, would be 40*. or 16/. for the remaining eight acres out often ; you have the following values: \u2014 land two-tenths or one-fifth for tithes commuted or deducted, four-fifths or eight acres out of ten, re- main one-half or produce of four acres for cost in cultivating"], [47, "29 CONSIDERED AS LAW. them again taken, two-fifths or four acres remain for the remu neration of the farmer, and payment of rent taken at the rate of 40s. for four-fifths of an acre, or 16/. for the remaining eight acres out of ten acres, one-fifth for tithe commuted being taken away ; value of two-fifths produce at the rate of forty bushels wheat per acre, at 8s. per bushel is 16/., left the landlord and farmer ; 16/. for rent, exactly balancing the value of produce after paying tithes and cost of cultivation. But if barley, it will not produce half the price of wheat, and if oats are the produce they will pro duce still less, or perhaps only three-fourth value of the barley ; these different grains will come round in succession, and unless the cultivator get his profits from the grass, the sheep, or other small matters, he could cultivate on his land, he would probably not be able to carry on his business. Enough is shewn to expose the pressure of tithe in expensive cultivation, although it may be calculated too largely for the tithe, and too little to the farmer, but which I doubt, for I have heard a most eminent surveyor say, he could not calculate the value of tithes ; and he could name a particular estate, I suppose chiefly arable, that, half the land was not equal to its benefit in arable land, so that tithe taken of that most of consideration in society, viz. corn land, is so high in any state of high cultivation, it runs away with the remuneration of the cultivator. Then is it worth cultivating is the question, which is answered that one-tenth profit, as per centage on capital, is the remunerative return, and that may be considered as fairly remunerative, but tithes taken thus, it is certainly very doubtful where the profit is existing on highly cultivated arable land. The calculations here stated may be objected to as incorrect; but I believe, referring the question to those capable of judging, they will be found nearly correct, generally so, at least, as to afford a data to go on for considering the question. It may, indeed, be said, if this calculation is just, or nearly so, it proves too much to be consistent. It proves not only that tithe is too great a charge for arable land to bear, and it is positively no matter of profit to the farmer, and a return only equal to the culture is not worth his while to cultivate. At first sight it does produce this inconsistency ; but it is to be recollected, that although the corn land itself produces not a sufficient return, yet the grass and sod-"], [48, "30 THE JUDGMENT der raised on that land, afford some remuneration, and that the calculation applies but to corn land, and not to the other land, which yielding a profit, and for the occupation of that the growth of the corn is beneficial as affording fodder, also space for stock, and the cultivating artificial grasses, turnips, and beet root for cattle, the farmer may be compensated from these other sources. But the accuracy of the calculation in all its bearings, does not so much signify, if it is correct as applying to the point whether the farmer gets a sufficient profit from his arable land for his outlay, and whether it is worth his cultivating or not, subject to tithe. The calculation as to tithe is whether one-fifth of arable land, being given in commutation for tithe, does not show that one- tenth of the produce of corn land is more than the cultivation of that can bear. The one-fifth, if not enough, is still a stronger argument, the one-tenth of the produce is too high. Or if it may be said, \" but too much is given, and the tithe owner gets more than he ought\" ; then all that can be said is one-tenth of the produce, if not so valuable, as has been stated or represented, the tithe owner who had got this allowance has had too large a proportion given him. But I apprehend there will be no great diversity of opinion on this point. The object here is to show that tithe on certain matters is too onerous, as those on which great capital or outlay is required ; and whatever the conclusion may be, if more accurately made, enough is shown that if one part is only capable of producing its equality in profitable produce in arable land, it proves that one-tenth is so onerous as to swallow up the whole or nearly all the portion out of which the farmer or cultivator can expect his return : and hence no wonder the agri culturist complains against it. That it is different the proportion of profit, of the produce on other things, it requires only to be observed that in grass land one-ninth is accounted an equality of commutation, this perhaps is too low considering the profit of stock, and the less outlay on such species of land, and one-eighth may be nearer justice. The idea of one-tenth being the just due or payment by way of rent, for the clergyman or tithe owner's right in the land, may be well and true, did it apply to things all of which were of moderate and uniform cost in raising, collecting, or in product ;"], [49, "31 CONSIDERED AS LAW. but when those things, and those the most material of all, as corn in extent and value which returns the one-tenth is more onerous by four fold or perhaps ten fold than the other or grass ; and it possibly is not too much to say that supposing the tithes or one-tenth of the produce, ought to be commuted at one-fourth of the arable land instead of one-fifth, it would swallow up nearly the whole of the profit beyond the rent. So that the one-tenth intended as the tithe owner's share of the produce, shall in fact be equal in point of profit, instead of one-tenth to nearly the whole, that the cultivator receives, or makes beyond his rent. And the one-tenth which might be borne with ease by the cultivator as to one part of his farm, becomes ruinous to him by the burthen on the other and larger part requiring a large capital and outlay. Such, then, are the grounds of objection to tithe, not because it is a payment for the tithe owner's right, which is just he should have, and is in nature of a rent, but because its mode, and quan tum arising from that mode, is so onerous as to be ruinous, and this being the case it is too much for any one to maintain or justify. It is, therefore, that I consider some modification is required in place of such a mode of remuneration, or acknowledgment of the right of the establishment in the land, and a payment calcu lated on the profit rather than the produce, seems more reasonable in a state where large capital or great outlay is required on the land. And, as the tithe affects both rent and profit, for as it takes from the agriculturist so it decreases his profit, as well as the rent he pays, it may be taken as one-tenth of each. Suppose then, in 1000 acres, the rent at 30s. per acre, to be 1500/., one tenth is 150/., the landlord, not the farmer, shall pay ; and sup pose the profit to the farmer at 8s. per acre would give 400/., this would give 50/., making together 200/. I prefer charging both, because it is clear the produce must affect both the profit of the farmer and the rent of the landlord, and it would not reach both, if one only were charged, or there would be collision or disagreement if one were charged for the other. But whatever the rent was, a deduction might be allowed that the tenant might make in his rent, while the tenant might be charged on his crop and stock, admitting all capital and outlay to be fairly allowed. Tithe as a rent or payment is a property in the land, and no"], [50, "32 THE JUDGMENT injustice or oppression can in reason be complained of any more than for any other debt or due. And the objection is only in the mode of payment and the quantum by the mode, which it is desirable should be altered, and if altered and settled in just and fair consideration ceases then to be an objection, or more an objection, than the payment of any other debt or due as a remunerative return or consideration for benefit or service re ceived. Having then shewn the necessity of a state religion, that the reformed religion is a religion conformable to the moral law, which is that all men must admit or acknowledge, or necessarily be go verned by for their good or welfare, and having shewn the charge and payment is by a property appropriated for that par ticular purpose of the state establishment, and is, therefore, no tax on others professing a different faith or tenet, and no matter of oppression but in the mode of estimate, and that this should be corrected ; it remains for me here to consider further on this point the policy or the use or purport, as a measure of govern ment or policy, an established or state religion as a means of public moral instruction. On this I shall briefly advert, because education, moral edu cation, or a knowledge of right and wrong, as concerns men, and of the rights, and above all, the duties of men, is evidently the business of all states or governments, and what appears to be not only the duty but the policy of any government or state whose office is the special care and protection of the subject, and the good of the state, is to see that true and wholesome doctrines are alone promoted by public instruction ; and to prevent, or cor rect, if attempted, spurious and erroneous notions, that other wise might arise ; and that will, from time to time, be prone to show itself in society, from the ignorant, the foolish, and the wicked, to promote their own views, or mistaken ideas, and to serve their interests. Or, not providing this instruction, the sub ject of moral knowledge would be neglected altogether, or certain and correct means of information would be hazarded. Without moral instruction altogether, though society might hold for a time together, yet without moral tuition, and instruction, the declension of the knowledge might arise, and its final loss as a"], [51, "33 CONSIDERED AS LAW. science ensue. Should this be the case in any state, that men without the knowledge of the law, and rule that gives as a science, are also destitute of religious instruction in the common duties of life, the greatest hazard will be incurred that they shall proceed in any certain course for their good. The only knowledge that will be remaining under the neglect of public instruction, will be in practice. This will be very much open to the variety of notions and interests of men. So much so, as many perversions of the rule, moral, will occur, or become known as the very opposite to what is the real law and fact of the case or subject itself. Of this, the errors and igno rance of men are abundant proof. The only way to keep in a wholesome path is by the know ledge of the subject, and the rule of direction this prescribes to men. It is a duty, therefore, I consider, of highest importance to government to protect and promote the welfare of society, and its object and interests, in its own maintenance, namely, the good of society, to instruct and cultivate the science or knowledge of the moral law, and what are the true object and interests of men, or society, by the highest authority men can have for it in religion. The only certain means of giving men moral knowledge, is by instruction, and to found institutes to effect this. This is, in fact, the true object and end of all religion, and the institution of it as part of the government or laws. As there can be but one real objection raised to the system of promoting moral knowledge by means of an established religion, which will be the objection altogether of infidelity, or unbelief of all religion, I shall conclude these observations by a reference to the moral constitution of man, or his peculiar nature, to shew he is a religious being, and that it is not possible for man to be otherwise. I do not mean to say that a man or men may not be found to deny the subject altogether, but such must do a vio lence to their feelings, and as reasonable beings must be incon sistent in their esteem and professions of liberality and free enquiry, if they do, and therefore such who do must also be pre pared to deny the moral or reasonable nature or constitution of man. ii"], [52, "34 THE JUDGMENT In considering the moral constitution of man as rendering him a religious being as opposed to unbelief or infidelity, as well as to shew the futility of men pretending to deny the subject of re ligion, a great point, not the least important to man, will be to shew that moral considerations or moral philosophy does not, as some pretend, leave men without the monitor of religion to sup port, controul, and sustain him in virtue, and to deprecate and reject vice. The supposed objection to the influence which a knowledge of moral rights will have over men in regard to their conduct re specting or affecting themselves individually, or their private life, proceeds in the idea of the influence which the mere moral powers will have over men in regard to their own conduct and actions as regards themselves, and refers only to a man's discern ment, sense, and reason, of what may be good and beneficial for him or lawful and unwholesome, for his pursuing a wise and good conduct or the contrary as to himself which is not sufficient for the government of his conduct, nor rendering him a respon sible being. The objection here raised against moral authority, as insufficient for human government or private life, or as to him self, pre-suppose that no religious notion or idea enters into the mind of men in mere moral contemplations or consideration, and which of itself is not sufficient for the government of man ; and that from morals alone or the creature man, governed by his moral powers, he would be in want of that monitor over him self which religion is over men, and is necessary for their better and more exalted views of the objects of life, and of their conduct in consequence, having reference to some further and more sub lime object ; and which, in fine, is considered essential to render men good and worthy subjects of any state and of consideration in the eyes of men. But has the moral powers of man no views be yond the mere governing and directing men in the good or objects of life or his being as a mere creature of this earth ? It is under such views as those just stated that the charge is laid against moral philosophy alone, that without religion it is a law of man alone, and has no sufficient bond over his actions or his conscience, for that conduct which reason may nevertheless point out as right, and proper ; or which alone can be esteemed"], [53, "35 CONSIDERED AS LAW. good and virtuous and approved by reason, as concerns man, (but which it must be admitted proves that reason is a sufficient director in what is right, although it may be supposed it is not of sufficient control to man.) But I contend and hope to shew that moral philosophy, resting on the judgment of men, does not leave man destitute of the wholesome power of religion. On the contrary, that the law of man, arising in the human judgment, that, also raises up in him religion, and would, and does necessarily make man a religious being, and makes him regard reason to guide him, and renders his obedience to it, as that he is bound to observe. The judgment always has been, and of necessity it must be, appeal ed to, as the director and authority of man. Why, then, should we raise objections to it ; or affect to despise or to regard it lightly and endeavour to contemn morals proceeding from it. By which we diminish that respect of morals which we ought to have of them, notwithstanding that which they proceed from, namely, the judgment, always is, and ever must be, the human director and authority. Esteeming the moral authority lightly and rather preferring dogmas and maxims, it prevents, and has prevented, that enquiry and investigation of its real nature or power, and the applying it to enquire and ascertain that which it points out, or men are approved by. Might we instance the case of rights, (our present subject,) as exhibiting, when duly applied, the reason approving the good, and granting it men as their right, and giving them in it the rule for their whole conduct ; every thing moral and approved, being so, in reference to the rule. And what either as authority or rule, can men desire or seek for more, or do they gain by any other law, rule, or authority, or what may be supposed to be so, different from the judgment ; which, in fact, is the authority every thing approved refer to or rest upon either directly or indirectly. To doubt or reject the judgment, when it distinguishes man by morals in his conduct, therefore is indeed shutting our eyes to the truth, and wilfully walking in darkness instead of the light of knowledge, reason, and science. In our endeavour to shew that the moral powers of man render him a religious being, by raising up his mind and thoughts to his Creator, I shall hope to take a view that shall be acceptable to every man, be his religion or faith what it may, as reasonable d2"], [54, "36 THE JUDGMENT and confirmative, as far as rests with man and the powers he is endowed with, of that great point in which all must depend of the necessity of a Creator of the universe, of the necessity of such to man, and of his being satisfied of such existence, by all he can see, reason upon, and determine by his judgment. I contend that, morally, man is a religious being, that is, his pe culiar nature necessarily makes him such. His moral powers lead him to the consideration of a cause, or creates, and renders such idea necessary for his comfort and solace in life. I consider, likewise, man is, by his peculiar nature, so fitted for a religious being that the views and conclusions that we can morally arrive at by the judgment, and which we shall hope to state in ac cordance with reason, raise that idea, and are so corroborative of the existence of a Supreme Being, and the great object, as concerns man, of his well-being and good conduct in this life, and the hopes of a future, that men of any persuasion, be it what it may, will feel that great point upon which all religion must flow from or rest of a Supreme Being, so well maintained in the peculiar nature of man, that the belief of every man must be supported in it, and feel his faith, be it what it may, corroborated and strengthened. The particular faith or tenet will be that alone on which the difficulty remains. But which, from all time, has been a difficulty ; but which difficulty is not thereby increased \u2014 on the contrary, I would rather hope, decidedly lessened \u2014 by the final object being reduced to one and the same point of moral good ; and, notwithstanding, in this deduction, the favour or concurring testimony of the human reasoning and judgment tends towards, and is applied, to the established church of this country. Partiality or leaning may be charged, and be it so, we profess a purely moral consideration of the subject, free of all aid, but the test of philosophy or science, to endeavour by that to set before us what the moral powers or agency of man can give him, or does arrive at in the subject, by strict disquisition. We have certainly been discussiug the moral powers and in fluence of man, and are intending to exhibit the mode of its working to effect his good, as the objects of human life or exist ence, and endeavour to shew this by raising rights, on which it proceeds, to respect, and have consideration of men as a duty to-"], [55, "CONSIDERED AS LAW. 3? wards one another. But it does not hence follow that the moral power of men extend no further in object, or in conception, than the promoting of the objects of men, or their good or benefit with one another here. Narrow, indeed, were the limits of the moral power in the human mind confined to considerations of mere animal existence and capacity of enjoyment of life, the obtaining of its benefits and delights, and avoiding all ills ; not to under value them, as the gifts or means of blessing bestowed upon man here which he is capable of, and the purport and object of him self as a being here, and the purpose of moral enquiry, knowledge, and study. Yet, notwithstanding these considerations, we do think the moral powers of man lead him to some further object of contem plation and consideration. Or else, why should or can he raise his thoughts beyond the cares of this life ? Or, whence can he carry his views to enquire of the nature and motions of the remote, but celestial, objects which surround his own earth ? The nature and motions of his own orb ? The traces in matter and formations of periods, apparently antecedent to all historical accounts, and details; and to existences, which could have no connection as relative to any thing now existing, but of primeval times or eras of its being the habitation of man ? The contemplation of these things alone, lead the considering man to something further, and beyond his mere being or existence, and the goods or ills of that ex istence, and lead him to a primeval cause and another state than this world or his existence here. We do consider the moral powers of man do raise in him a religious sense or feeling, and of itself an influence over his ac tions, that renders him a responsible being or agent for his well or ill advised and ill directed conduct in life. We do not refer to the idea the moral powers can attain to or give men of their Creator, or refer to any moral notion of religion, to compete with any prevailing belief of any men, but to shew and identify man morally as a religious being or creature, and that morals do not estrange or unfit him for the purposes of religion; but leads him towards, and forms him for it, and make him in fine a religious being. And we do conceive that the moral powers of man would, of themselves, raise that idea"], [56, "38 THE JUDGMENT of religion that would, of itself, be sufficient to bind and govern man in a right course of conduct according as his own reason may serve to direct him, and raise the disapprobation or expression of the disapproval of man for the contrary. Or why do men pass a good or bad opinion of men for their lives ? But to oppose the objection to a state religion on the ground of unbelief, and to prove the contrary, man, we consider, in his nature by morals, or in his moral powers of mind and reason, to be a religious creature or being ; and cannot be otherwise, that is, he cannot avoid in the exercise of his moral powers or the faculties of his mind of reflection and reason, raising the idea of that Cause, whom men recognize as God, and that such notion as he can raise morally is of itself sufficient for the purposes of moral go vernment. It is a question men must determine within themselves by the evidence of their own senses, reflection, and reasonings, whether there is a Supreme Cause, and in such cause exists a Supreme Being or not ; and he, the creature man, as an enquiring, re flecting, and reasoning being, is in any way responsible to that Su preme Being. We consider no man can, as a reasonable being, with the dispo sition of enquiry that reason gives him, and assigning or looking for the cause or motive of all he sees, and more especially in looking at the influencing causes and effects in nature, not ad vert to a pre-supposed cause or source for all that exists in na ture ; and that he does, is evident in every history or knowledge of man from the most ancient times which history records, to the most wild and uncivilized or uncultivated states of men known or discovered in modern times. There is, in all instances, a pre-sup posed existing power or authority that is referred to, that has, or is supposed to have influence over things beyond mortal under standing or power. In this alone is the idea of a Supreme Being or Superior Cause, or Agent, raised. However simple, unrefined, or opposed the ideas and notions men are found to form, in many instances upon the subject, to more enlarged and enlightened views, as the expansion of the human mind by knowledge, ad vances his conceptions towards such object, the idea of such cause or God is raised. And raised, whence once raised, we do"], [57, "39 CONSIDERED AS LAW. not hesitate to see and admit, the idea is too agreeable and con solatory, as well as flattering to his hopes, not to dwell on, and to cherish. The limit here in life, the mortal anguish and suf ferings of the man, in the loss of bliss, life, and existence, pre sent to his view, that he is capable of enjoying, is too painful in deprivation not to hold forth a hope in future beyond the days of life. Or able to see such bliss and not enjoying it, he feels his loss in it, and hopes for recompense at some future day ; and his expectations can only rest in such Supreme Being or Power raised in his mind's conception. Once raised then, the idea of a future state is too consolatory ever to be lost. Why is our nature formed to raise it, by reason, enquiry, and imagination, unless we were to cherish it, and it were to answer some consolatory purpose, admonitory, and con trouling us here, as well as to give us expectation for the future. It were a painful reflection that man should picture a consola tion, to set him above all earthly cares, whether of pleasures de nied him, or refrained from by himself, or evils imposed by others or misfortune, of pains and endurances of body, and wrongs and unrequited services, and yet the virtue of suffering and forbearance was of no avail. Reason forbids it, and reason tells man, no reasonable view had not a right to be expected in the reali zation. We arrive then, in the result of human reasoning, to this in argument. Is the idea of some pre-supposed cause, and of a future state, raised by reason in the human being. And if it is, as we think no one will or can deny, does not reason, in raising it, jus tify man in the hope of that approved as reasonable ; and reason assuredly justifies him in what is reasonable. Man, of necessity, must confide therefore in that so raised, and in accordance with his reason. But let us consider again what the moral powers of men, view ing the subject of man's being, raise and justify to man in regard to a cause of his own existence, and the universe, and as an ob ject in this cause, a future state. Man as a reasonable being, looking for an assignable cause for every thing as far as he can trace or see, necessarily arrives at"], [58, "40 THE JUDGMENT the enquiry of whence is his man's original creation, or being, the world and all things he sees, and what is the object of an in tellectual enquiring being, with reflecting and imaginative pow ers. And which enquiries carry him to a consideration beyond the confines of a present world, and being as to him, man, both as to its occasion or cause, as to a future prospect, the present state of whose (man's) being, as a creature of the earth he inha bits, does not satisfy his enquiring and imaginative powers. Rea son thus promotes the enquiry, and imagination and reflection assigns a cause, and in a cause, an object beyond that he sees and knows, and carries him to, or opens to his mind a fu- ture. Now it is true a man cannot know what he cannot see, or un derstand, but it does not hence follow that causes and purposes may not exist, notwithstanding he may not see or know them, and in reason he may be satisfied of an existence of causes and purposes, which he cannot see, or have knowledge of. There is nothing absurd or contrary to reason in assigning a cause to things seen, which cause cannot be seen, or to imagine a purpose in a thing seen or known, which purpose cannot be known. And there is no more absurdity, or is it contrary to reason, to suppose an ori ginal cause as to man, and a purpose of his creation as a reflecting and enquiring being, which he cannot see, than assigning a cause for any thing else seen, or purpose in it, but which cause and pur pose he cannot see or discover. The absurdity or irrational act of man is to raise or give an inconsistent, or impossible character or existence to such causes or purposes. Confined within the li mits of reason in consistency, or reconcilable possibility, we see no want of reason, or any thing opposed to it, in the imagination raising a cause in the subject of consideration, whatever that may be, and assigning a purpose, in that cause of the subject con sidered. If that subject is an intellectual being, endued with moral powers of reflection, reason and enquiry, and is capable of re spondence to his enquiries by his imagination, and by that he can resolve the question asked of himself in his enquiries, in conformity with bis reason, he is right, and he is justified in accepting and confiding in the solution he attains, both in a cause, and in a"], [59, "41 CONSIDERED AS LAW. purpose of his being. They are both alike necessary for his more correct moral government, and his consolation, constituted as he is, a moral being, and as such necessarily holding a course of moral or rational approvement for all he does, which, of itself, characterizes his actions ; and renders him a being dependent on a future, for satisfaction in his expectations, and solace in his present controul and forbearances. It is seen, therefore, that the nature of the being man, when en quired into, declares him to be a creature sustained by his judg ment, and the hope of the future. Shall he, or can he in reason, deny this very essential property of his moral being. Shall he refuse the solace the extension of his enquiring faculties leads him to, and which alone can reconcile him, as a moral and en quiring being, in his present existence. Unless, I say, a man abandons his reason, and does an outrage to his common sense, his nature, and his own feelings, he cannot reject that which his constitution leads him to, presents to him, and having raised up to him, of a future, is essentially necessary to his solace in his desires and wants as a rational and reflecting being, as he, moral man, is. The moral power or peculiar nature of man in mind directed to the natural world, seeing and reflecting on himself, his own being or existence, the terrestrial world he inhabits, and the various things in it, and the universe he sees and contemplates around him ; and reasoning on what he sees, he asks and enquires within himself, what is the cause whence they first came, or were created, and though the cause is too mysterious for his finite or limited powers of discernment or comprehension in such powers as he has, his reason tells him there must be a cause, and therefore ne cessarily raises the idea of a great primary cause in a Creator which, recognized as God, God is thus revealed to man in nature. Morally viewing the subject therefore, or according to human powers God is apparently revealed to man in nature ; and affirmed to exist by the fact of the existence or being of that nature itself, which must have a cause in the conceptions of an enquiring and rea sonable being. And this idea agrees or accords with his peculiar nature as solace in the cares, troubles, and anxieties of life, and in matters of hope and for a future, raised up by the powers of"], [60, "42 THE JUDGMENT human imagination, and which cannot be erased, but with the extinction of the faculties that characterizes man above and from all other creatures. Man himself, can have no evidence in the sensitive facul ties of his nature, of the cause and future, but he has in his moral powers and peculiar nature, his reasoning faculties, his reflecting and imaginative powers, and if reason, though wanting of the proof to his corporeal senses, is satisfied of the existence of God and a future, and the moral nature of man is wanting in such ob jects of his consideration for his consolation and happiness, then it is only wise and reasonable he should confide in what his moral nature thus raises in him ; and by the reality of which, the office of human life and existence is only reconcileable. Then if man, by his moral powers of mind and reason, can raise the idea of God in a Cause or Creator of this world, and as the Origin of the things of this world; and having raised this idea, he cannot divest himself of it; the idea raised, the truth or re ality of a Creator and God hath an existence with him, man ; and while those powers, or his senses remain, the impression is made, and cannot be effaced, and is past any denial that can be available to his mind or reasonable senses. It is, on such reasons he grounds his belief or credence, and to deny the idea is to oppose reason, and therefore absurd to reasonable man. * To man alone, as far as his reason can discern or direct him, is the power or conception given of God, through his moral na ture in his mind ; and he must feel and view himself, man, as the favoured creature to raise or image God, in such primeval Cause and Creator. It only remains for man as a reasonable being, and for us in considering morals or human powers and actions, and the means he has to direct or guide him, to endeavour to see what his contemplations are, or in what way, as regards or affecting man, he is to view or can view or consider a subject so superior, and * This is an idea to be found in Hume, but we hope it is not less efficient on that account. AVe see no reason why the benevolent ideas of any man should not be adopted, and that for good ends. >"], [61, "43 CONSIDERED AS LAW. above all others, and of which his means are so limited in regard to considering or comprehending it. In approaching this subject, under moral considerations, we are only using those powers men in common are endowed with, and will consider the subject as well as they enable us. What that power is we look to as a primeval Cause, is, and must be, a mystery to man ; but when he considers his own intellect, the formations of the terrestial world, the beings on it, the har mony and system of all ; when he compares the magnitude of some creatures, and the minuteness of others, and infinitely va rious, yet all perfect in organization, and ordained to fulfil the places and offices assigned them in nature ; when contempla tion, study, and science opens to him knowledge of the heavenly bodies, as to their size, order, motions, and immensity, and to man, infinity ; when he looks on his own powers, and the discove ries he makes in natural bodies, and the order and system, and component parts, properties, and qualities of such, and the won derful efforts in art and knowledge, of himself, the creature man, in powers, productions, and searching into nature, and the com ponent parts of his own earth and nature, \u2014 the power and intelli gence of that Being, the cause of all, surpasses all comprehension, and man is lost and bewildered in his senses, except in consci ousness that such must be; but further certain knowledge he cannot attain to, such is a mystery. That men should not be able to attain to further or certain knowledge, than a reference to a first cause, in their idea of the Creator, and that further or certain knowledge of this, and that the Cause itself must remain in mystery, is a matter of providence certainly desirable, as far as we are enabled to judge, from our reason and finite powers of discernment, and is therefore agree able to the nature of man as he is constituted. That men should be enabled to raise their mind up to a Creator, is a comfort and happiness to man ; and of first importance for his guide and controul in life ; but that the cause itself should be a mystery, and that God, which is recognized in such cause, should remain unknown to us further than in existence in such cause in our imaginations, is a matter man must see on reflection, is only compatible with his being as created. For with more"], [62, "44 THE JUDGMENT certain or specific knowledge, it is inconceivable that man would be a creature fitted for his sphere on earth. With certain and specific knowledge of the nature of that Cause he raises in his mind to exist, it is very clear, were its power and intrinsic na ture seen, or known, man would either be overwhelmed with his own insignificance, or with a certainty of that future as to existence, of sort, or kind, or form, exhibited to him, the desire to reach or enjoy it would unfit him for his station and progress in this life ; which life, a matter of no consideration in comparison with the future, would excite an impatience that would only render him desirous to rid himself of his present state, that he might arrive at the other. Formed as we are here for the offices of this life, it matters not human conjectures or what views he can conceive and image of the blessings to be held out to him in future, and of his duties of labour and contentment here before he arrived at it; or formed as he is, of the power of God to form him otherwise, or to fit him for such condition ; nor does it matter that he has not a more perfect knowledge than he has ; nor does it matter that such imperfect knowledge as he has being used as an argument by the sceptic, or the wicked, or the foolish, that there is no such Being or existence as God, and that man should have no future hopes or expectations, whose only hope, happiness, and enjoyment, in this life is composed of future expectations here, as if in display of what he really was and is, a creature of futurity, whose nature, as a reflecting being, renders him a being of futurity here in this life. We have only to look on man as he is, as he is constituted in nature by that cause, however myste rious that cause is, and to facts which cannot be denied as existing in the being, man, himself. And constituted as man is to raise an idea of the Creator and of the great purpose of such idea to him, as a future state, but with capacities to bear with and pro mote his views and interests in this life under the cares, pains, anxieties, and disappointments attending it, as his state, as a being here is ; we consider looking at the state and condition of man, constituted as we find him to be, a greater knowledge more certain and specific of his Maker and of his, man's, future state, would be incompatible with his existence in tins life. An"], [63, "45 CONSIDERED AS LAW. idea, that he can raise to himself, of his Creator ; and hope that he, man, is a matter of consideration of that Being ; and for the future is enough ; so far, as to comfort and solace a reflecting being as he, man, is, and to raise his consideration in what way respect and humiliation to the Supreme Being is due, or is agree able or consistent with the purposes of his existence. But further or more specific knowledge which lead him, or give him an assur ance, to more than hope, it is evident would not be suited to his be ing constituted as it is to live, and bear with this life ; and were it so that he had such further knowledge, for all that he can see, it would in truth render him a different being to what he is, or require that he should be differently constituted. It is enough, consistent with the peculiar nature of man, as we find him here, to raise his mind up to his Creator, a future, and hope, in every moral view ; and for every moral purpose, as far as man can recognise by his moral powers, his reason, and his judgement, he is justified and solaced in, by every reasonable consideration he can give the subject, as essential to his happiness here, and good conduct in life, and that he may not despond to give him hope for the future. In reference, then, to the idea which man can raise to himself of God, and the views and considerations he can have of that idea as affecting or concerning himself by his moral powers, it is necessary adverting to the subject, to make some observations to point out, as well as to prevent, any error or misconceptions which otherwise might arise. It is evident by the moral powers of man being constituted in man, that they are destined and designed to guide, govern, and direct him conformably with such powers or as a moral or reason able creature. But although the human reason raises up to men the idea of a Creator and of a future state or existence, and which is in no wise inconsistent or incompatible with it, and which is agreeable and consolatory to men, and even requisite for his solace in his moral constitution, with powers of thought, reflection, reason, and en quiry ; and who from his moral constitution in his powers of re flection, it may be truly said, is as much or more a creature of the future, than of present, objects ; yet what that Creator or God"], [64, "46 THE JUDGMENT really is, or what the nature of that future that he looks for, and expects, is utterly out of the power of the finite or limited powers we mortals possess to know, and all attempts to arrive at it, must be frustrated in vain and futile conjecture. The adopting which will only lead men into errors and absurdities, and the miseries attendant upon errors and ignorance. Such, for instance, as we find in many primitive states of men ; and in states and nations who have not yet opened their minds to science and knowledge, and the enlightenment and expansion of mind proceeding from thence; and who, in their ignorance or errors, consider images and fan tastical inventions of the mind as gods, and constituting the Pro vidence that reigns over the world, or adopting observances and formalities found among such ignorant and unrefined people that are hurtful and prejudicial to man, but supposed agreeable to God. Of the more exalted and refined notions of raising the mind up to a Creator of the Universe, and to a divine and intellectual Being in essence or existence, whatever that may be, supreme of all, such is worthy of reasonable beings. Happily for men under Christianity they are supplied that comfort and solace their moral nature seeks for and requires ; and in the pure religion of Protestantism as professed in the Established Church, nothing can be more in conformity with that discipline man is capable by his moral powers of forming upon the subject. But even Christianity is the subject of the human judgment; and has been the subject, con sequently, of all the errors and miseries attendant on the errors of the fallibility of human judgment on this subject. And we know of no instance stronger to exemplify the power and direction of the human judgment and its authority to man than in Christianity, for it has been under such errors of the human judgment in the Christian religion, that we must, in reference to former times, view its mere worldly influence and the deceptions practised upon mankind by its ministers, and that as much or more religious massacres and persecutions have been inflicted upon mankind more horrible in atrocity and blindness of zeal and cruelty, as were ever inflicted under any other religion. But yet we can only consider that it is by the human judgment applied and exercised in considering what is the true meaning of Christianity that we now have arrived at the pure religion as it may"], [65, "47 CONSIDERED AS LAW. be now considered to be, as professed in the reformed religion of Protestantism in this country. No better or stronger example of the power and authority of the human judgment can be given in directing men even in reli gion, than that religion itself must be accepted by man by means of his judgment ; or how is man to distinguish its merits, or one religion from another, or any doctrine, rule, or ordinance, or ap plication of its rules to worldly concerns, but through his judg ment. The disputes and controversies in Christianity sufficiently demonstrate that the human judgment is appealed to in the Christian religion, and the various divisions of the Church, of Roman Catholics, the Greek Church and Protestants ; and the various sects and branches and institutions, again, under each of these divisions, prove they resort to, and the authority of, the human judgment in the direction of man in religion. But notwithstanding the errors and frailties of men, Chris tianity is a religion of peace and reason in its true character, and as such is in unison with and confirms the moral judgment ; and is the most congenial for man to accept, and best calculated to pro mote his happiness. We come now to consider man being a creature endued with moral powers in mind and reason and judgment ; such are the designs of his being, created with such powers. We have then, in the moral consideration of the Supreme Being, to consider what is to be collected or inferred morally, or by the moral powers of man, as affecting or concerning man. It is evident then, in the fact that man being a creature endued with moral powers in mind, and reason, and judgment, such are the design of his being, created as he is, with such powers. The moral powers of man, we must consider are the design of God in his creation of man, or in nature as we find such power to exist. They are no more the design, however, in the creation of man, than any other power or quality, or property in him, man, or in any other being, is the design in these beings or crea tures as they are constituted. But reason being constituted in man, is that power in him, and which he has to direct and go vern him, and the benefits resulting from which he is, according to his moral nature or reason, to avail himself of, and is evident by the design manifested by his being created with that power."], [66, "48 THE JUDGMENT What therefore is consistent with the powers of his mind, and in this of his discernment, his reason, and judgment, is that purpose or object which in reason he is justified in, with regard to the design of his being, as he can morally see or discern. That the moral powers, or peculiar nature of man, is a matter that requires study, enquiry, and consideration to gain a know ledge of, and well understand, is as evident as enquiry and study is requisite in regard to any other subject. And that his, man's, improvement in this respect, is only to be attained by time and study, is evident in the ignorance and errors, in which former periods of man's existence, as all history shews, have been involved ; and is instanced in many cases of uncivilized people and races of men at this period of day ; and in nations who, al though professing some knowledge and science, and are advanced towards some degree of civilization, are yet far from being emerged from barbarism ; also in some people and nations who have appa rently retrograded in arts and civilization, and is witnessed by familiar example among every people, in those who have not had the powers or advantage of instruction or information being given them, and are at a low degree of knowledge and refinement in comparison with others of the same nation, or people who have had such advantage. Study and knowledge then being necessary for the understand ing the moral powers of man, it is no matter of surprize that men have not been more and better directed by their mind or reason than they are found to be; and it is only by study and acquiring knowledge of this power that it can be expected men can be better directed or guided by it, than they appear to have been. The object of moral enquiry and moral study, is to give men this better knowledge, to make him in fact, better acquainted with himself, his own powers and properties, in governing and directing himself, by that distinguishing power or characteristic which makes him a moral being, and places him in a different situation to all other beings. We are not to imagine that because reason is our guide, it there fore,will at once see all, and see rightly, and direct men rightly for all experience tells us the contrary ; and the experience we gain from childhood to manhood tells all men this. I make these observations to shew that it is not to any defect"], [67, "CONSIDERED AS LAW. 19 or insufficiency of his powers of reason or judgment, that a charge is to be made against these, the moral powers, that they are a bad and deficient means of decision or direction, and that the errors and mistakes of men have originated and many evils and miseries been imposed on them by mind, imagination, and device of men. Such have only arisen from the want of knowledge of the powers and use of them. For, in fact, to what is any error seen or correction made to be attributed, but to those very powers themselves. If, therefore, these powers set men right and correct their errors, it is to the want of study, knowledge, and cultivation of them, the moral powers of man, that his reason and judg ment have not been a better guide. Time alone produces the improvement, and let us hope the time is come of a true know ledge and understanding of the moral powers, as to their authority and their direction of men, and that we may hope to profit by it in a better state and condition of human beings. And assured we are of this, that in that which is more consistent, and in con formity with reason, and that which it directs him towards in what it approves, or the good, is that most in conformity with the design of his being, through the powers or means given him, and acceptable, if we can, as beings created at the will of him all omnipotent, suppose any thing proceeding from us is acceptable ; but that it is the design, that we are assured of, in our reason, and which may lead us to hope for the objects of the future. The moral powers directing us, that which is our guide is our reason, and what this points out in conformity with the design of our being, consists of whatever is the good, or that which is consistent with or in conformity with the being, man, as the ob ject, the reason is applied to consider. Applying these powers to the consideration of man himself, they give him his rights in his good which such powers approve ; such we therefore consider is the design in man from the design of his moral powers, which is the design of the Creator, as manifested by the fact of creating him with such powers. And whatever this good is, or whatever it consists of, and wherever it is to be found, promoted, or at tained, is that agreeable to the design of his being, and which we must hope as in reason we must conclude is the purpose of his E"], [68, "50 THE JUDGMENT creation. That we shall not see the good in all things, or the best, is most certain. But as far as our power and capacities ex- tend we are only in reason responsible, and the design is fulfilled to that extent, for it can make no difference to the power omnipo- tent whatever we do ; but on going counter to what is right or good, which our reason points out, or reason approves, as the power or means we have to guide us, we are not fulfilling the design of the power given us ; which is a matter only of our own concern, that is, affecting us, but not our Maker. But with the design made evident in our reason, that we are to do what that points out is rio-ht, or good, it were the greatest of foolishness to suppose otherwise, and therefore what is reasonable, and in our power, or practicable, is what men in reason are called upon to do. And if any future hope or benefit may depend on our own elec tion, then will virtue, as consistent with all reasonable views, be the course that ought to be observed by men in themselves, and be that to raise or found the best hopes of that state whatever it may be of the future. Therefore, with reference to what is consonant with the idea man raises, through the means of his moral powers, of the Creator as it may concern or affect him, man, here, in a moral point of view, or as he can judge and discriminate by means of his moral powers is that which they point out. What these direct him, as to man, or concerning himself is seen in his moral rights; and the judgment of man approving his good, and granting his rights in that respect, and requiring of necessity the regard and considera tion of men of one another in this respect, and in this raising their duties, is that which, according to his moral powers, is agreeable or consistent with the views he can form of the Creator, and the design of his creation as that approved by the powers man is endowed with for his direction. And what is good and are his rights in this respect, and his duties, is that which is agreeable or in accordance with that Supreme Being as he can morally see or judge. Thus it is seen that what is good, and men approve as such, and grant their rights to, and raise their duties in this respect, is what must be agreeable or consistent with the idea that man can"], [69, "51 CONSIDERED AS LAW. morally raise of that Supreme Being, and consequently required of him, as far as rests with him, and he can see and judge, and beyond which we must in reason or morally hold him not responsible. But to this extent it is certain, men, by their moral discern ment are required to have regard, by the view they can form or raise of God, independent of what is morally required of them by men, in the objects and purposes of life, or the good of men here, if the two can be separated, but which I consider they cannot, be cause the moral purposes of men, as far as man can see and dis cern are those designed in his constitution, and consequently agreeable to the design of the Creator, as far as man can see and judge by his moral or rational discernment. It is, therefore, evident that men, as rational beings, to act or be in conformity with that law God has constituted in their pe culiar nature of their judgment, that the moral good as that which the reason approves in whatever it may be or consist of, is that which they are called on to regard. And the contrary, as rests or depends on men must be repugnant to what is required of man or the design in his creation according to such powers with which he is endowed. Reason and his duties here, with regard to his state here, as depends on men, and his duties in a religious view as he can morally see, or discover, call upon him to do good, and we hope the stronger notion will be felt, and admitted, by men to do good, in the religious ideas that men can have, and cannot avoid in their moral nature ; and that the want of that self-control, or monitor over men, will be no longer charged against morals with this exposition, shewing the nature of the moral powers of man in this respect, which never can leave him desti tute of the Being or existence of God, the solace of the idea, and the high approving authority of what is good, being consistent with reason, being consistent with the design of the creature pos sessing it. It is not too much to say that men's powers are the means of pointing out and directing him in what is good ; as it may be necessary to make this observation to meet the idea, which may be opposed to these ideas of moral good, and men's judgment being the rule or law in this respect as vain and arrogant, and presumptuous ; for we are assuming nothing more in pointing e2"], [70, "52 THE JUDGMENT out, or judging what is good, than our means implanted in us common in all men, enable us to do. A rule, or guide, or some means of direction, we necessarily must have in ourselves, or we are not discerning or reasonable beings, or responsible for what we do, and we step not beyond, nor presume to any higher or further idea or knowledge, than what these give or can attain to ; and whatever may be supposed, as to moral powers, or upon the insufficiency of the powers of man to point out what is right as to man, the human judgment under all and under every circum stance must be the means of human direction, and our business is evidently by study to see what is truly most consistent and consequently right to the best of our judgment. A question arises, in contemplating this subject, in the idea of an Almighty Being or Omnipotent Power, that we are here brought to consider, which is, how is the idea reconcileable with reason, and the limited powers of man, since every thing that is, or happens, or comes to pass, that ever was, or ever will come to pass, how can we reconcile, that any thing that happens, or act that is done, or matter that comes to pass, can be contrary to the will or power of the Almighty. In the raising or contemplating the idea of a Creator, all idea, view, or knowledge of that power, that the human mind is capable of, beyond the mind's conception, that such must be, is inexplicable, and a mystery. All that man can do, is to speak or judge from facts, or matters that come within the sphere of his powers, and arriving at the idea of a Creator, man can go no further into the mystery of that so raised, or arrived at, in his enquiries and reasoning. That appears enough. It authorizes hope, and gives him solace in life, that his peculiar nature learns and requires. Having done this, or gained this view or height of his, man's, aspiring, in the power he has to ac quire by the pre-eminence of mind above other creatures, he is stopped, and must fall back to facts and things within his com pass, and of existence here upon earth. Having raised himself up in his imagination to God, he is repelled from all further solution of the idea, by the impractica bility of the subject to his limited powers to reach. He can take, and is justified in doing so, the solace his reasoning leads to, and which the conception of his mind gives him, in hope, but"], [71, "CONSIDERED AS LAW. 53 nothing more. He is thrown back to his means of progress on earth as his locality, and must, for the purposes of his sphere assigned him, apply to these means to direct his course upon the orb of his existence. In doing so, man reverting to facts and things as they exist, finds in himself a creature with mind and reason, and to which he must resort, and be content with that, for his direction here. As beings with such power as we have, to those we must refer, and be satisfied they are as God's design, given us for our direction, and proceed upon them, as they direct him, or enable him to see or discern ; and in using them to the best of our efforts, we are using them as in reason we must consider they were designed, and that as the law for our direction ; and as man is possessed of the power of reason, that is his guide, and means of direction. Man, as a reasonable creature, his judgment gives him his rights to his good, and raises his consequent duties coincident with them ; and gives him a rule for his direction, or points out the course for him to observe. And referring to the judgment for the individual regulation or government of man, whatever tends to health of mind and body, and rational happiness, and is the moral good, and is approved by his judgment, is that exem plified by the design of his nature as a rational or moral being, for his course in life ; and his duty in obedience to the design of his moral nature to adopt, as he hopes in the providence of God over this world, and has solace in those hopes for futurity. The moral law existing in the human judgment. I shall con sider, in the next Argument, the human judgment as the law of man, with regard to the objections that may be raised to it."], [72, "54 THE JUDGMENT CONSIDERED ARGUMENT II. THE JUDGMENT, CONSIDERED IN REGARD TO OBJECTIONS THAT MAY BE RAISED AGAINST IT, AS THE AUTHORITY OF MEN. In considering the human judgment as the law of men, I am aware that objections will be raised to it, until the subject has been duly considered, from the apparent incertitude in the human judgment, evinced in the errors and mistakes of men, their dis putes and disagreements in opinion on various matters and subjects brought under consideration, in which the judgment has to decide; and generally, we may say, on account of the incertitude of its nature, and the errors men are at all times liable to make in matters dependent on their exercise of it, or in its liability to make wrong decisions in a moral point of view. But let us see in what respect these objections will apply, and whether they affect the authority of the judgment in respect of rights. The uncertainty of the human judgment, and the errors it is liable to make, we shall find to be in cases of difficulty, and where it has to decide in matters relatively applying to, or affecting, the subject of consideration. In a plain matter of fact, as what is good, or what that good obviously is, in certain particulars or some matters definite or specific, as human Life, or Pro perty, it is apprehended there can be no doubt or mistake in men's minds or judgment. But in what shall be for the service, or in accordance with the object of his consideration, as his Life or Property, the good or human benefit, or is consistent with these, or as the matters themselves, considered good, may be dependent on, or affected by circumstances, or the various things, in human affairs or transactions, and connections, there may be doubt or uncertainty, and oftentimes, difficulty of decision, mis takes, and errors. In matters plain and evident, we shall not find any diversity of opinion or mistake in human judgment, and there can be no reason to reject or deny the human judgment, as a sanction or"], [73, "55 IN REGARD TO OBJECTIONS. authority, for want of certainty or validity in correct or right decisions. And it will be only in matters difficult of discernment, and in relation to that, of which they can form a competent decision from its obviousness, that men will be uncertain in their decision, or liable to error. The objection, then, to the judgment as human authority, will not be in matters plain and evident, and what we term the obvious good, which there is no mistaking or disagreeing in, or forming different opinions on, but only in those things difficult of discern ment, and in relation to, or affecting that, in regard to which such relative things or circumstances apply, men are called upon to decide. Shall any man mistake, doubt, or differ, in regard to that which is good, as a general purpose or object with men ? Shall or does any man or men, doubt, or differ in what that good obviously consists of, or refers to, of men ? Do any men differ or dis agree in the good or benefit of man being approved, and being that object which is mainly sought to be supported and promoted by men ; and that good consists of as to man, of his Life, Property, and Justice. But we will endeavour to exemplify what we mean by obvious good, such as no man can mistake, or shall not be able to do otherwise than recognize and acknowledge. What is the obvious good, is a plain or unequivocal matter, as Life, no one will doubt or gainsay ; and there will be no disagree ment or difference in men's judgment, as to this, or of Property, or of Justice. That they are matters plain and obvious, and there can be no mistake, and are what ought to be as regards men ; but of the relative good, or what applies to these things, and may affect such, and may affect them variously and differently, under different circumstances, or combinations of things, may be, and often is, matter of difficulty to see and discern. Thus, what may be beneficial for life, or prejudicial, or more or less one or the other ; or what may be wholesome, or the contrary ; or what acts or things shall lead or tend to the dangers or hazard of life, or the contrary, may be matters sometimes of doubt or of difficulty to discern or decide upon. And as Property as a general institution of use shall be good, no man will doubt the appropriation of things for the use of man, as food, clothing ; and the exertion of"], [74, "56 THE JUDGMENT CONSIDERED men, or the drawing forth, as it does, the industry, and ingenuity, and employment of men, for the increase of produce of it, for the benefit of a population. But of what things Property shall con sist, whether some things, and what, shall be common, or what shall be more select or exclusive of interests in common ; or what rules, forms, or modes shall constitute or determine what shall be Property, as possession, and purchase, descent, distribution, and in some cases, its use, management, and application ; are all matters of relation; and what shall promote Property, or its objects, are matters of relation, and all these things may be doubtful, and men may have different notions or opinions. Cli mates, soil, and modes or habits of men, will all make a difference of effect as to things constituted, or to be constituted Property. Justice is a matter all men will regard as good, as a fair and equal measure of consideration. But in matters concerning justice, as laws, and the mode of administration of them, are matters of relation ; and complex cases for decision may be difficult to settle and determine. In these matters men's minds may be perplexed, differing, and often opposite in their ideas on them. These matters are in relation, and the point wherein the difficulty may be ; while the broad matter of justice in fair and equal consider ation, is plain enough to all, and all shall be agreeing, and have no doubt, but that, it is what is good, or of its being beneficial to man, and what ought to be. Difficult as it may be, on some occasions, to see and determine what relatively may be good, and the incertitude or incapacity of the human judgment on these occasions, this, I submit, can be no ground of objection to its powers or efficacy in matters obvious in agreement, or consistency, with the object of men, in their benefit or welfare ; and in those particulars, we refer to, as such obvious matters, in rights. But, in all occasions of human action, and the use of his judgment in discriminating upon them, there are, in reference to the greater rule of rights, minor rules, which cannot but help and assist men in their discrimination, and will be found in the moral precepts ; good being the great or general object, the precepts, the rules of human actions, according with it. Yet, whatever may be the deficiency of judg ment in matters relatively, concerning, or affecting, the human"], [75, "IN REGARD TO OBJECTIONS. B'J object in good, and the incertitude, doubt, or disagreement of opinion, the judgment gives man his right to Life, Property, and Justice. In this obvious good, there is no mistake, incertitude, or disagreement ; and men, therefore, have a certain rule to refer to, in relation to other matters, they are, or may be called to judge, and act in regard to, concerning the rights of men ; and such is the first step towards correct judging of relative good; rights being a general rule or direction to refer to, for which every thing is of moment or concern, or not, and by which every thing is ruled or determined, good or bad, or right or wrong, as being in agreement or not with rights. There is no difficulty or disagreement in the judgment, as to the good, and what that obviously consists of; and it surely, then, cannot be doubted, or questioned, but the judgment is not to be diregarded, or rejected, for uncertainty, or liability to error, in the case of rights which refer to the obvious good of men. All men are concurring in their judgment in approving their good or their benefit ; and to refer to a more definite meaning, or particular idea of what this good consists of, or what is meant or referred to by it, what is obviously this good, there can be no uncertainty in, or mistake, or disagreement, namely, that Life, Property, and Justice, are the matters or things of which the good obviously consists ; and under which subjects the benefit or ser vice of men may be considered or comprehended. There is not, nor can be any uncertainty, disagreement, or mistake here, or indeed would these things be the obvious good or benefit of men, if they were not plain and evident to all men, and in which they cannot but see and know, and seeing, cannot mistake, or have any doubt or uncertainty respecting them. These are his rights, to his good I mean, in the judgment of man approving that ; and the objection of uncertainty or liability to error in the judgment is not applicable to it, as an authority for his rights ; since it applies to what is obvious, the terms or meaning of which there cannot be any error in mistakes, or dis agreement. And the objection of uncertainty, error, or mistake in the judgment, will not apply as against the judgment being an authority for rights, as plain and obvious matters. The apparent uncertainty of the judgment, and the errors and"], [76, "58 THE JUDGMENT CONSIDERED mistakes men are liable to, is in matters of relation, or in con nection with any subject ; and in good in that which relates to it, and is the relative good therefore. But we are not to confound the subject of matter of relationship with the things themselves, good, as Life, Property, and Justice, which are matters obviously good. What things are good in a relative sense, or serviceable to these things or objects of men, or accord, or are consistent with them, are matters of relation, and various as the nature of things and acts, their various effects and properties, and the infinity of their combinations. The incertitude of the human judgment, therefore, applies but to that which may be in relation to rights, or the relative good, or as things, or acts may affect for the better or worse, those rights. The judgment being uncertain in the relative good, is not a point of consideration here, though happy should we be, if we could give a rule of direction to men, in which they could not fail to agree, or never mistake ; but that is evidently impossible, the various relations of things being of infinity. Beyond the establishing of rights, the first object, certainly I wish, and have attempted something further for the human direction ; which is in the way rights apply, and can be considered in their accom plishment, according to human reason and powers of discernment, or what we may term, the working or procedure of the rule. In doing this, I have touched on those matters apparently inconsist ent, or not reconcileable to rights, as the rule of human direction as to particular cases, but not as a general rule ; and I have en deavoured to explain, as in contradiction of the rule of rights, the case of men as individuals pursuing their own good, which is opposed to that of others ; and the same in Property, which ap parently precludes all but the owner or proprietor ; but at the same time, it is to be borne in recollection, is subject to a claim of society for the general good. As these matters are involved with the relationships or con nections of human transactions, or modes which men can proceed in, practicably both as to Life, and especially as to Property ; the explanation of which is necessary, or should be given, in a work professing, enquiring on, and setting forth the law which governs"], [77, "IN REGARD TO OBJECTIONS. 59 man, to exhibit its consistence, and satisfy reasonable beings of its truth or correctness, in its own consistency as a general rule. And which explanations, we trust, are sufficient for the purpose. There are other matters, likewise, which are in direct opposi tion with rights, as cases in which partial sacrifices are made of them ; or they cannot be regarded : and the prime law, stands at variance with itself, and its rule of rights. This occurs under governments and laws of municipalities or states ; what we may call generally civil laws. They form exceptions to the general proceedings of men under the prime law, and prime rule given by it. It is requisite, in a work for the setting forth what is the law upon which men move in the moral sphere, or by his judgment in the relationship with, or concerning man, to explain the partial, but unavoidable interferences or obstructions, in the practicable observance of rights. And it is hoped this is satisfactorily ac counted for, or explained. The prime law or authority with man, of his judgment, and the rule it gives in rights, is, notwithstanding points in practice, or matters apparently at variance, and in others which are con tradictory, and, therefore, forming exceptions, clearly and effi ciently set forth, and unequivocally explained, it is hoped, in the present work. So that no being, with any pretension to reason or discernment, shall not be able to do otherwise than see it, and seeing it, acknowledge it. Referring, as we have before observed, to the judgment as the human authority for rights, we are not without apprehensions of the prejudices and light esteem human authority is held, in which the subject of such high importance as the human welfare, is con cerned. Much of this prejudice may be the effect of education, in habits, manners, usages, and customs, under which men are taught to disregard the judgment, in deference to the existing modes and ideas found among them as a people. But if men will reflect on the means of governing and directing themselves, the most prejudiced will confess, that it is to this very judgment they refer and depend on, in all they do, or whatever they considerately do, or set esteem or value in what they do, as rational beings. But views or ways of considering things, different from that, men"], [78, "60 THE JUDGMENT CONSIDERED have been accustomed to, are opposed by the prepossession which occupy men's minds on such subjects, in which a different mode may be introduced. As this is, and will be the case, with regard to the considering the human judgment as authority for rights, and we shall have to combat this difficulty, in the way of pro moting our own views ; we consider it a measure of necessity to advert to the point, and meet, in order to dissipate the objections that will be raised to the authority of the human judgment, and which may be opposed to the promotion of the views we have taken here, of rights, and the good of men founded upon such authority. To meet, therefore, the objections that may be made to the authority of the human judgment, I shall observe, that such authority may, upon first consideration of it, be objected to, from its appearance as unstable and unsound, and a frail and weak ground to rest the sanction or authority of men upon, for their rights and duties, or actions ; and what is good in this respect for men as morally existing or dependent on them, or human agency. It may, moreover, be said, if men do take their rights by the consent, or opinion, or judgment of man, so they may deny them, or refuse them, or take them away ; for as they were granted by the consent of men, so they might take them away by their dis sent ; and that rights of the good of men, resting on such a prin ciple or basis, is of no stability ; and optional and uncertain, and depending on human judgment and opinion, is wayward, and never can be rendered stable and certain, and principles of conduct so founded, are good for nothing as to their authority, or stability, or certainty. But what does any thing men value or esteem, or principle or rule of practice, depend on, but human judgment and opinion. What does any allowance, grant, or admission of men to one another, depend on, but judgment, or consent, and opinion, of its being right, or proper, under investigation of facts and cir cumstances. What does any unison or great resolve of men, in important interests to men, either in morals or in policy, depend on, but on the judgment and opinion of men ; and that being right, it shall be, or ought to be, maintained or carried into effect. In fine, what is there resting or depending on men, but what"], [79, "61 IN REGARD TO OBJECTIONS. depends on his judgment ; for whatever is moral, solely arises and depends on the human judgment, i. e., the mind, its power and influence. If the judgment is a frail ground to depend on, and liable to mistake or error, or of an unstable nature, or its approval, or what it grants, is liable to be refused, withheld, denied; or de viated in, or withdrawn when granted, men cannot help this. Such is their nature, and such their means of conducing to their good, or their ends or objects of life ; and its defects, if such men are pleased to view them as such, cannot be avoided. The judg ment and its fallibility, pervades every thing human, and to be effected or brought to pass through human means, or powers, or through the aid or agency of man. But the frailty of the human judgment, or the instability of human resolves, will not alter the authority he has to depend on. His judgment must guide and direct him, and however frail, it must, notwithstanding, be that which he has to depend on for his guidance, and to the end and object to be obtained by him in all moral purposes. But, on the other hand, instead of the frail and defective quali ties lamented in the power that decides and governs men, we view the judgment as the great and estimable quality, the distinguish ing and superior mark in man, and from which every thing great and good, and admirable, firm and permanent, and transcendent as to men, and human happiness, arises and is to be expected. But certain is it, that if rights are to be objected to, as dependent on the human judgment, then such good to man has no other or better ground to rest on ; but we cannot conceive a better, more sta ble, or satisfactory ground or authority ; and we cannot see that any thing dependent on human discrimination, can have any other or better, or more desirable to reasonable and considerate man, or more strong and stable ground. But in serious reflection, what does guide or direct men in what they do, but opinion, his discernment and judgment of things ? What holds him to any purpose or stedfast resolve ? what im presses on him the necessity of promoting and instructing men in various sciences and knowledge, but opinion, and judgment of the propriety and correctness of those notions and things he adopts, and spreads, and strenuously and devoutly adheres to ?"], [80, "62 THE JUDGMENT CONSIDERED What stronger force need he have to moral rights, agreeable and consistent with the feelings and wishes, common to all men ? what stronger force than his judgment need man have to sustain, ad here to, and promote them ? and, no doubt, seeing what benefit rights are to man, and how agreeable they are, he will not be more apt to lose sight of them, or the more inclined to disregard them, because they are shewn to be resting on his judgment. It evidently appears that rights are derived to men by each other, in their judgment and estimation, and they need no stronger base or authority to rest on, than the human esteem, for their maintenance and promotion and benefit to man. What will be in accordance, or best promote this, is another matter ; but the cultivation of the knowledge of rights, the source of which explained, is evident to the meanest capacity ; and their advantage will always be an inducement, I cannot doubt, because agreeable to the feelings and wishes of all men ; and when they reflect that the human good is morally dependent on men themselves, they will more attend, study, regard and esteem the authority, when rendered plain and evident. But let us make some further observations on the fallibility of the human judgment, which, being subject to error, may mislead men, and, therefore, liable to mistake or error, that the judg ment is, on that account, an objectionable authority to raise or found rights, and the duties of men. It is certainly true that the judgment is liable to error or mistakes ; but the judgment, as before stated, depends on facts and matters in relation to that subject it has to decide upon, and if it cannot see these facts, and the bearing and relation of matters on the subject ; or they are difficult to see, or make out ; error may, no doubt, be the consequence. But the occasion of error is the difficulty of seeing the matters, or subject, we have to decide on. If matters are clear before us, we have no difficulty, and the truth is pronounced by the decision of the judgment, and the judgment alone. And the matter we have to decide on, we humbly submit here as to rights, as the primary principles of human action and direction, and object of men, is one of these subjects where there can be no doubt, but is apparent for every man to see and judge of, beino what concerns every man in his good, and every man must be"], [81, "63 IN REGARD TO OBJECTIONS. acquainted with, of himself, when his mind or attention is di rected towards it. Every man is moved to his own good. As to himself, he must be alive and sensible to his own Life, and per son, to the subject of Property, and to Justice. I do not say, every child is, or that there may not exist idiots, or diseased minds and bodies, that counteract a healthy discernment and decision ; ignorance, prejudice, habit, education, and manners, may mislead and blind men ; but to rational and reflecting man we appeal, and we say none exist but in the course of experience of existence, or to that time when the mind enquires, and reason dawns, we say none are insensible or not alive to their own life or existence, their persons, Property, and Justice ; and of such it is, that men are called on to decide, by their judgment, whether these are good or bad, men should have and enjoy these, or should not have them. In short, whether the rights of man to their good, which good consists of, and exists but in these things in reference to society, are his object, his wish, is his desire or not, and what he approves of or not. Matters so evident, when once explained as the subject of consideration, or pointed out, requires no answer, whether man can be mistaken in his judgment upon them or not. The relative right or wrong, or what may be in correspond ence or consistent with the rights of man is another thing, this will depend on circumstances as before observed ; we speak not of this now, but of principles or rules as objects which are to govern that which is relative, and we say, if the rights of man, as principles, are not facily and clearly established, on which we set out to judge of other things in relation by, we shall ever be at a loss to discriminate correctly, although in our natural in clination, or self-love, we may be striving for something, and come to some fair and general conclusion, through even such defi cient or unscientific mode of procedure. If men are to act and dis criminate, let them know what their point or object is, especially in that called \" good,\" and his authority for adopting it ; for on that, without discrimination, though the motive with all, much error, much mistake, and much calamity, has, and will and ever must befall man without study and ascertaining truths, which are the only sure modes of proceeding correctly, and dispelling errors."], [82, "64 THE JUDGMENT CONSIDERED There can be no doubt or error in the judgment of men as to their rights, when the subject is considerately and properly placed under view as a matter of truth, or science ; and do not let us on the objection or diffidence, that the judgment may be liable to error, find fault with, or reject its authority, or consider light ly of it ; or the less regard or respect rights, granted or conceded by it ; and the duties of man resulting from thence, as established or originating in the authority of rights; which, deficientas such may be, is, nevertheless, the only means men have of directing them selves rightly, and which, when duly considered, however failing, is yet the great and distinguishing feature in the human charac ter, and from which every thing great and good and glorious, estimable and valuable to man, is raised, promoted, and sup ported. It may be another complaint or objection to the mode of ex plaining rights, or the authority it is maintained they rest on of human judgment, that men are constantly transgressing them, or acting in a manner opposed to rights so granted, which if as serted to be founded on that judgment, it is absurd and unrea sonable that men should oppose what their judgment approved. And it may be alleged that they therefore cannot be adjudged, or granted by men to one another, when men act adversely to them or oppose them. But the mistake here is, confounding the judg ment of man, with his actions or conduct. Men will not always seeing right, do what is so ; their judgment in moral conduct is generally right enough, or they could not know when they do wrong, or be judged by others when they do so. But it does not prove because a man or men act contrary to, or are opposed in what they do, to the rights granted as respects others, that they do not therefore grant rights. Do not men break their agreements every day, does it because men in breaking their agreements, are guilty of wrong, therefore disprove their con tracts ; or rather does it not shew that they make such, but break them. The grant of rights is the contract implied in his esteem of the good, and the acting contrary to, or opposing this, is wrong, as the breach of their agreement implied, which is right. Men in morals, will not act rightly, or in obedience to their"], [83, "65 IN REGARD TO OBJECTIONS. judgment in every instance, because their particular interest, or supposed interest, wishes, or desires, will be at variance with the good or rights of others. But his judgment of rights are yet de monstrated by his knowledge that he is doing wrong in abridging or invading those of others, as in the plain cases of fraud, theft, robbery, or murder ; and others considering that he does know this, deem him guilty of, and responsible for the act of wrong, injustice, or infraction of rights, whenever he commits such. It is clear, therefore, although he is guilty of opposing his judg ment, yet his judgment of rights has granted them, or considered others intitled to them, or he could not, of his own knowledge, be guilty of wrong, or criminal in acting contrary to them, which men are, that do act wrong by others, and others know this by deeming him wrong and guilty, having a knowledge of it. But let the authority of the opinion or judgment be weak or frail, the judgment directed by reason, with a reasonable and considerate being, is the guide and rule with man, and a more universal or powerful authority as respects man, and that moves him in every thing than opinion, we cannot conceive. But be cause it does move him in every thing he approves, he is not aware of it, or forgets it is his authority in all he does. The only drawback that we can see, is that .which man cannot help, which is, its liability to error in matters relatively of good. This it may be, and certainly is; but man cannot help it, or avoid its frailty or weakness. Still he must act and be governed by it, for whilst human, he has no other means or authority for his direction ; and weak and deficient as it may be, it exalts the possessor of it above all other earthly beings, and gives him do minion over them ; and raises himself from the lowest depths of ignorance, and the shackles of prejudice, and barbarism, where with the state of man is environed in his progress to knowledge and civilization, to the splendid height and power of moral go vernment, and not a creature of mere sense and passion, or little above brutes, as men are whose minds are unopened to their moral qualities. That the superior power of judgment which it has pleased his Maker to endue man with over other creatures, should F"], [84, "60 THE JUDGMENT CONSIDERED be respected, and venerated as his authority, is evidently more reasonable than that it should be rejected or despised, be cause it may not be perfect, or is infallible ; and however humble in its simplicity, or unheeded because the attention has not been directed to enquire concerning its authority to man, it is not the less of importance, but shews only that it is suited to the subject for whose use it is intended, both in the lowest stage of ignorance as well as the highest state of refinement ; but the true estimation of it, is only to be developed by time, enquiry, and research to see its importance for his moral good. How is it men in society dwell in amity, but by respect of each other, both in their person and their property, and by this live in peace and order necessary for a state of amity, unless by the rights given each other in the judgment. Otherwise what is there to prevent men existing but as brutes, in regard to the respect of life and property, and using the talent of mind, or the moral pow ers merely to effect brute objects and purposes, and no more, but that the talent or power of itself raises the rule of men's direction in contemplating the good or benefit of the beings possessed of it, in their approving judgment, esteem, or opinion of that good which should be had or enjoyed, regarded or respected in man, and for which men must regard and respect one another, and which es teem or opinion that they should regard or respect one another in their good, constitutes that which they term their rights. Let men reflect and consider that every good, and every action requisite for that good dependent with men, proceeds, is regulated, and is sanctioned, but by the judgment. The hut or cottage, and little property of the poor, and the earnings of his labour and industry, his wages, his time, and the reward of his honest and virtuous conduct, are secured and protected by the re spect the judgment considers due to him, and gives him in his rights ; were it not for them, he would be open to the power of, or interference of any who had the means of oppressing him. That men meet and associate in peace and order, only by the re spect and consideration of one another, by the same judgment of what is due to man in his rights, and in those of what is due to one another, that Property of all kinds, and requisite for the ex tended benefit of society, and of men in that state, and of all"], [85, "IN REGARD TO OBJECTIONS. 67 human establishments necessary for society, of houses, farms, cultivation of land, the produce of that and store, cattle, and other stock, that every matter of mechanism, of use and service, as carriages, machines, manufactures, implements and tools of hus bandry and mechanism, and every thing of the kind of use and service to man, are raised, regarded, and protected by the same authority or the judgment by rights given in Property, and by the respect and submission of men to this power of their judg ment, or by its authority over them in what it directs men to do. All trades and commerce, and intercourse and dealings by men, and between men, flourish and depend but upon the same respect and consideration adjudged due to rights, and what is right rela tively, or is proper for the rights granted men through the same judgment and the precepts of good conduct in truth, ho nesty, charity, temperance, and virtue, as means of accomplishing and effecting the same good in rights granted, proceeds, rests, and is sanctioned by the same cause or authority. Laws and go vernments exist but upon the same. Laws are altered, varied, and fresh institutes made, as serves or improves the state of men. Governments themselves are upheld and maintained, and dynas ties and institutions changed or varied by the judgment of men, and for the rights of men to good, raised and given by that judg ment; and more especially may we notice that the laws of nations are raised and depend entirely on the human judgment. Laws of nations are those rules observed in the intercourse with nations and people approved by them as being reasonable ; the acceptance and observance of which rules are entirely dependent on the judg ment, they being the subject of no superior power to govern or control, or command obedience to them. The observance of these laws depending on the parties themselves concerned in their observance or administration, they will certainly in a measure be open to evasion and breach, and as the fact is witnessed in many instances, that where one partly possessing more power or advantages than the others, or its convenience suiting, it will not always regard the laws, but make innovations in, and breach of what the laws consist of; or in other words, in that which reason says is right or just. Yet those laws which are now so much the base of all intercourse in peace, and conduct of hostilities in war in civilized F 2"], [86, "68 THE JUDGMENT CONSIDERED Europe, are laws not of legislative enactments, but of the judg ment exercised in the various points of common and necessary oc currence, elucidated and discussed by authors who have written on the subject, and such form the rules to guide and be observed by powers and their subjects towards each other in their inter course and transactions in peace and war, when unhappily such occurs ; and in commerce and intercourse. The laws of nations are stiled the law of nature, as well as of nations ; and they exist but upon the discussions and decisions of the human judgment upon points of action, all of which, however, bear relation to the rights of men in the rule and direction of all human estimates of action. They are stiled the law of nature as discussing and drawing the decision from, what is agreeable to, or consistent with man or human nature. They are, in humble sub mission, wrongly termed the law of nature, and with propriety may be termed the law of the human judgment, considering man or human nature as regards mankind, in -the character of large and distinct masses or portions of men composing nations, in their re lations, transactions, and dealings. They are the law of the hu man judgment and not of nature, because the judgment decides or gives the rule, and nature only affords the subject of its consi deration, the good or interests of the beings it concerns ; but it is the judgment that decides or gives the law or rule by what it sees is agreeable or consistent with the beings under the relations or circumstances it has, or is required to consider. The laws exist, however, no where in nature, but are raised in the human judg ment or moral agency of man, as applied to nations instead of individuals; and are similar as between nations, as the moral law or that so termed is between men. And there is the same compunctions of reason to observe them, and where men and nations regard their character as the elevated beings of reason, they will regard them the same. What more then can be said for the high authority of the human judgment than it being the law by which nations carry their bearing of regard and consider ation towards each other. Although we may be diverging a little from our subject in these passing observations on the laws of nations, yet it will serve most perfectly to illustrate the authority of the human judgment and"], [87, "69 IN REGARD TO OBJECTIONS. the difference between that, as the law of man and the law of nature. Let us pursue the subject a little further. What is na ture as constituted in man ? His component parts consist of flesh and blood and bones, limbs, and power of motion, and viscera and vessels or formations for performing certain offices of life, as breathing, circulation of blood, receiving nourishment and supply ing it to his entire body. He has senses, appetite, instincts, and judgment, and he has, moreover, mind or intellect called reason, the latter constituting a peculiar nature in him which distin guishes man from all other beings known. And man, thus alto gether constituted, we consider is his particular nature. The laws of nature, as to man, are the various powers, properties, and qualities of man, thus as constituted or organized. But these are not laws or rules of men as nations or subjects of different coun tries, governments, and powers, to observe in their intercourse or interchange with one another for respect and regard and to un derstand and regulate their proceedings by which they shall meet, and conduct themselves in peace and amity, and to the promot ing their mutual benefit and advantage, or if on disagreement, and disastrously, hostility shall occur to carry on and settle those differences and disagreements in war and peace. The constituted nature in man is not trade, traffic, and commerce, treaties and alliances, subsidies, and tributes, seas, and waters, boundaries, for tresses, armies and navies, and the material of war ; all these con cern the laws of nations. It is true these things proceed from man, but who can call the laws and rules concerning these things raised and founded by man, the laws of nature. The laws of nations and the moral law may be regulated according to or con sistently with his constituted nature, common in him as in other creatures, or as to what is agreeable to it, and. shall promote it, or not, or its objects. These laws are rules drawn or formed agreeable to nature in what is good or serviceable, or will effect its object in what is good or wholesome, but surely we cannot call such laws or rule made or instituted by man, those of nature, however applicable or referring to nature. Shall the protection of a go vernment, afforded to foreigners, received by such a power, be called a law of nature? and such is a main law of nations ; shall the fulfilment of treaties, be called a law of nature ? shall the"], [88, "70 THE JUDGMENT CONSIDERED interdict of foreigners from the land, or soil of another coun try, be considered a law of nature? But are these not laws, or dinances, and institutions of men, and proceeding from his judg ment ? His judgment, drawing rules and forms of action for his conduct or observance, founded we must consider them to be in the human judgment, agreeable to man, which forms one common standard for his rule and guide ; but evidently is the law or rule raised by the judgment, and not by nature ; but is a direction or ordinance for his conduct, that may agree with nature, or accord with its object or purport. The laws or rules are the effect of the exercise of the nature of man in the powers his nature has or gives man, and which we term the peculiar nature of man in mind, to distinguish his na ture from other beings. But the law so raised, or made, al though the work of his peculiar nature is a distinct thing from that we see constituted in man, and is a mode or way of conduct seen, or conceived in his mind, according with his constituted nature or objects to be attained by man, consistent with nature and acquired by the powers he has in mind of acquiring know ledge concerning that it is applied to, or of which he considers, namely, man. The fact, we think, we have made sufficiently clear for every man to see that the laws made and raised by man are not exist ing in his original nature, constituted as nature is, but a matter raised and founded on his judgment, by his discernment and the knowledge he acquires ; and which, indeed, the very nature of the laws themselves, prove, as they are acquired, and are to be learnt, or taught, to have a knowledge of them ; and, therefore, cannot be themselves the law of nature constituted in man, or all mankind would know them, or would have known them, as they knew their nature to consist of body, members, flesh, and bones, and blood. But the laws of nations, in many instances, are unknown and are found to be almost unknown, or very slight indications or traces of them in uncivilized nations and people, until they mix or have intercourse with other nations. The laws, however, alluded to, as those of nations, especially resting on the human judgment for their observance, shew the power that creates them, and controls men as to their performance, and"], [89, "IN REGARD TO OBJECTIONS. 71 exhibit the power and authority of the human judgment with man, and that the rule or law it raises, though harmonizing with nature, is the dictate of the moral power or agency of man in his pe- culiar nature of mind which perceiving what harmonizes or accords with nature, promotes the purposes and objects of it as discernible to reason or what is healthful. And it is plain that the judgment applied to the consideration of men as individuals dictates the moral rights as a rule in accordance to the common nature of man for the purposes of its healthful attainment or good ; and that the judgment consequently is, and must be, the authority of men, and that they rest upon no other, and men can have no other morally speaking. It is true men apply the term nature, or refer to nature, in many of their observations, as authority ; such, for instance, in the common observation. Is it not natural for a man to do or not to do such or such an act ; but such we consider is used only in reference to the act obviously harmonizing or agreeing with nature, but no more. If a man protects his child, it is called a natural act and justified as such, and instinct and natural love and affection prompt it; but, if a man does this, or any other act, agree- able to nature, on his knowledge of it and approving it, or his judg- ment approving, on the consideration of such act, such knowledge and approval is acting upon his judgment, and is the moral property of his action, and which constitutes it moral, and he is justified mo- rally, or by his judgment approving, the act being good or according with or agreeable to nature. And it is but the connection of the act with our common, natural, but good feelings, and its correspond- ence that makes us not discern that it is otherwise than a natu- ral action. As we may see in the case of what self-love dictates, and rights, being in harmony with or corresponding as to the same object, namely, man's life, or good, and as we shall say more on hereafter. The conclusion we arrive at from these facts and observations is, that the judgment of reasonable man applied with considera tion to the circumstances, to every thing coming under his cog nizance, and where his agency is required, or called into action, is his law and authority, and his justification in all his decisions and acts, and morally speaking he can know no other or better."], [90, "72 THE JUDGMENT CONSIDERED But however obvious when pointed out, the law of the human judgment is, the consideration of this law, and record of it is ne cessary for the more facile and accurate instruction, and purifying and correcting all errors and mistakes in human conceptions and con siderations respecting the subject ; which, left to the mind or re collection, and oral instruction, it might be liable. To preserve also the knowledge of the law or authority of man, it is necessary it should be embodied in characters; such we hold to be the great use of letters in science, and in morals not less than in natural philosophy, and lore of all kinds. The object and utility, there fore, of giving these considerations, and the committing of them to record, is the offering the more ready means of instruction, and the better means to correct as well as prevent any errors and mistakes, liable to arise, if depending on the recollection of men, habit, and oral instruction, and to preserve the truth of science in letters. But, after all that I have urged on the vainness and futility of the exceptions that may be and are taken to the insufficiency of the judgment as the law or authority of men for what they do, on the ground of its incertitude or liability to errors or mistakes, and all that may be urged against such exceptions or objections raised against admitting the judgment to be the law of man, let me ask would it not be the greatest absurdity to say that the actions of a moral being did not proceed from his moral powers, or that morals or morality did not derive their source from the same cause the moral powers or moral means of man, of mind, and in this reflection, reason, and power of action, in correspondence with what his reason or judgment points out or directs. No reasonable being, therefore, can deny the law of the human judgment or the moral powers of man, as the source and authority for the hu man actions or the moral conduct, for it is from them all his ac tion and conduct arise, are directed and proceeds, which we recog nize as human or moral. I have referred to the human judgment as this law or authority, because the judgment of a reasonable being is that point or internal act of his moral powers, or what we may describe as the concentration of the working and actino- of the moral powers of mind on which he decides that which it ap proves, or the contrary it rejects, and from which all his outward or corporeal acts proceeds, or his conduct deemed moral."], [91, "IN REGARD TO OBJECTIONS. But because it is liable to mistake or error, or be misapplied in what it must approve in reason, it cannot, therefore, be denied as his law or authority for what man approves, and does, or ought to do, in consequence. It may be a deficient power, or liable to err, as it is seen in what we term the fallibility of man and human failings ; but yet it is his means, and only means which he can see for his moral actions, or what is moral or proceeds from man, that he is responsible for either approving or rejecting. That it may not err morally, or as to man, it is his business to enquire into the nature, or what is required for the being, for whose use it is employed or applied ; and this is what we are doing in our enquiries, and shewing what it approves, or what it sees is right or proper for man, and what rule or mode of action it can discover correspondent with the object, man, it is applied to : and this the intellect of man does in discerning his good, which it necessarily approves as being consistent with the being, and, therefore, takes or gives that, as the rule of his action. This good, defined for his direction, is that of which it consists, viz., Life, Property, and Justice, as being matters obviously in har mony, and necessary. These approved, are taken as his rights, and in them he has a rule for his direction. How man is to pro ceed on them, is again explained, in those matters which are necessary to draw the human attention to, as relating, or con nected, or involved with them, and such is the work before us. Confining ourselves to what is approved as consistent with man, as that to be explained for his information and direction ; and the contrary, or what cannot be approved, not being consistent or agreeable for the human being, in relation to the whole race, as that which he cannot receive or accept, as the rule for him to adopt and act on with a view to promote or obtain, \u2014 but on the contrary, to avoid or refrain himself in doing. I will not dwell here on the observations which can be made respecting the au thority of the human judgment, as I have such frequent occasion to make them in the course of this work. It will be evident, that all men do act on, or that their actions refer to, the authority of their moral powers, reason, and the human judgment ; whether a man acts either in reference to a moral purpose, or as to any other object or purpose he is desirous"], [92, "74 THE JUDGMENT CONSIDERED of accomplishing ; his moral powers directing, both as to what is moral, as to its object or relation to man, as to other things. That this is the fact, will be evident, if men will reflect when they act, that they act in that way they consider right for their purpose, properly moral or otherwise. For a man, acting ac cording to that he considers right, or adopting that which he does, because he considers it to be right, refers to an act of re flection or consideration, however slight or unperceived, from the spontaneous act of his mind. This act of consideration is his moral power in his mind, and consists in the act of decision, of his judgment ; and he does that he considers right, this power deciding that it is so, and, therefore, is his authority for that he does or considers right, in the relative meaning of this word. Right, it scarce need be observed to the reader, will apply to various things, as it is merely a term used of approval, consistency, harmony, or generally of agreement, proper for the object con sidered. As right, morally, whether it is good or proper, as concerning man, or himself, or others, or those his acts concern; right, in this sense, as the principal subject of his concern, applying to what he appropriately denominates, Rights. Right, as to any thing he has to do or effect, in science, arts, commerce, trade, or any thing under his consideration, or his acts relate to, or as to his understanding his subject, or mode of treatment of it, or in any thing else he has to do or accomplish, whether it is proper or consistent for the purpose, and as opposed to the con trary, or what is wrong. Here it is only applied in morals, or as to what relates to man, and in which they have any doubts as to their authority in their judgment. Men only doubt the judgment as their authority for what they do, when they come to consider and reflect on it as a law or authority to men themselves, conceiving it fallible, and, therefore, an incompetent means for their reliance, as a justification or sanction, therefore, for that they do, especially in morals, or his acts, right or wrong, as they relate to man. But not adverting to this high or responsible office of justification or condemnation as to man, they invariably do resort to it, and act on it in all they do, as their sanction or means of decision and justification ; and in reality, it is their authority in morals, though not adverted to"], [93, "!\u25a0> IN REGARD TO OBJECTIONS. as such, reason pointing out what is agreeable or consistent with the subject they are called on to judge in, or under contemplation, and their judgment deciding on their reason. Except for the doubt and objection commonly raised against the judgment, as the authority to men for their direction, it would be needless to say any thing to satisfy, or point out to men, that the human judgment is the law or authority of men ; I shall, therefore, advert to the occasion of this diffidence or doubt, in men's minds. The cause of men not immediately perceiving or admitting their authority in their judgment, is, we consider, owing to the circumstance, that the moral powers, or their reason and judg ment in moral concerns, is of such spontaneous or ready appli cation, that men do not advert to their judgment as that authority upon which they act, in whatever they do, or may do ; and in referring to it as so high an office as their authority for what they do, or ought to do, from its being liable to error or fallibility they are not prepared to give it due consideration or weight, as such sanction, and doubt the truth or reality of its being such authority, from inefficiency or want of soundness for such pur pose. To such cause, we must attribute the doubts men have of their law in their judgment, and rather adopt maxims or dogmas as rules of action, forgetting, that in such adoption, the very authority rejected in their judgment, is the means of giving or adopting those very maxims they set forth as a superior claim for their attention and respect. While in truth, as moral beings, men can have no other, for it is that power or means they have, which constitutes them moral agents, and all they do, moral acts. But the efficiency, or right, or just decision, will depend on their just reasoning, or discernment, as regards that which their judgment decides ; or the right discrimination of their judgment will depend on their just or wrong way of viewing the subject, relative to which they are called on to act. The judgment will, also, as well as deciding on what is to be done, or ought to be, give rules to direct men in attainment of their object or purposes; as in morals it will give men the precept of truth, of honesty, charity, as in other matters, it will give or point out to men, rules in them in what it sees is a right mode of procedure, as rules"], [94, "76 THE JUDGMENT CONSIDERED of art by which men learn the modes of procedure or what relates to such other matters or things, the same as the road or track laid down for the traveller or voyager on his destination. Such are what is seen to be right or proper or agree or ought to be as respects such things, and is the judgment discriminating on what the mind sees or learns as to the matters which are right or in agreement consistent with them. But to judge rightly, the mind must enquire into and investigate the subject, and learn the facts and circumstances relating to it, and obtain a knowledge of it, for without which, it, the reasoning, will be on uncertain grounds, and the judgment liable in consequence to make wrong decisions. In considering morals, men are applying the moral powers, morally, or in relation to the subject of man himself, concerning which subject, therefore, to act rightly, and that his judgment may discriminate and decide what is right relatively to that, men must enquire and investigate the facts and circumstances relating to it. It is true his judgment may decide erroneously, but he has morally no other means to direct him, and it only remains for him considerately to investigate his subject and ascertain the facts and circumstances relative to it, and he may then form reasonable conclusions on them, and his judgment founded on his knowledge are the means for his being correct and right, and more he cannot do ; but so far he is as a reasonable being required to do according to the powers with which he is endowed and blessed beyond other creatures. Rights, as a most important subject to man, being their title or claim to their good, and rule of direction for that good, I have directed my attention to the consideration of them, the better to understand them, and to shew that they are founded or rest on, or are derived from the human judgment. Taking their origin in the approving the good exhibited by man directing or applying his mind to the consideration of man himself, and in this consideration, or man himself the subject of his own consideration, his judgment approves the good or what is in agreement or consistent with man and thus raising his rights or claim or title to his good. And that rights are thus founded or derived from the human judgment can be no disparagement to them, such being the law and autho rity to man, primarily directing or governing him in all he does,"], [95, "77 IN REGARD TO OBJECTIONS. and the distinguishing characteristic above all other creatures, of which his rights are the emblem. In fine, every thing moral must arise from and proceed on the moral powers or law, and this is the human judgment, the decision of a reflecting and reasonable being. What, therefore, can be greater or more universal authority to take for his rights than his judgment, and to found or draw the grant of all good resting or depending on men. What needs or can be given more in proof that in judgment is the law of moral man, than every thing being decided on and resting upon it as rests with man. With his judg ment is his good raised into moral existence, and by it promoted and maintained to the best of human power and ability. And certainly, were morals and virtue not appreciated in the human esteem and judgment, little could we expect that their actions would be in accordance with that which was not esteemed. \u2014 Were the good, therefore, not esteemed and rights in this respect, consequently esteemed, they would not exist. They would either not be developed, or if raised or ever in existence, they would, without the appreciate of human judgment, be an nihilated or consigned to \u2022 destruction at the instant they arose into existence, and men would be as brute beasts, influenced by instincts, sense, and passions, but without moral modes or rational approvement as the great feature and grand distinction of moral man. Hoping that I have disposed of all question and doubt as to the authority of the human judgment to man as his law, and that, in fact, he does refer to it in all he does as his sanction and direction, although he does not recognize it in the case of morals, or in his descrimination of what he terms right or wrong, or good and evil, and as his justification in these respects, until it is brought into his consideration. I will refer to another question, on the subject of rights, founded on the human judgment on the supposed objection, of not having sufficient influence over man, and I shall make this reference in order to dispel such, or shew its futility, previous to entering on the further enquiry and exposition, as to rights being founded or derived from the human judgment, and being the rule for men's direction. Another question may be raised on this doctrine of rights,"], [96, "78 THE JUDGMENT CONSIDERED which we consider is proper to meet, and that is, that it raises a consideration of men towards one another, but it does not raise a consideration of a man's acts as regards himself alone, that is, although they require his respect or regard of others, yet in his own acts as regards himself, and where they may not affect others in respect of their rights, or be supposed not to affect them, here, in his own acts concerning himself, it throws no re gard or restriction, farther than his own will, pleasure, or dispo sition, be it good or bad, serviceable, or injurious. We have said his own acts, as regarding himself, and which may not affect others, or be supposed to do so. We have thus described it to combat the objection on this ground, as appearing at first sight without consideration plausible, it may have favour with some, but not to admit the truth of such position, because we can hardly imagine an act bad or improper committed by a man as affecting himself which shall not in some way affect or have relation to another, and therefore concern their rights. The rule as affecting himself may be said to be improvidence and extravagance of his means, bringing on ruin and misery, in dolence, drunkenness, debauchery, and profligacy of all kinds, sickness and ill health. If a man does not affect, or can be sup posed not to affect the rights of others, in these things, but only himself, the doctrine of rights, except as regards his own wisdom and prudence, has no control over him in restraining vice or evil as it is called in these respects. But is his wisdom, or prudence, or our reason not sufficient in this respect ? We think, however, man, in granting rights to one another, grant all the good that may be resting or depending on one man towards another man, practicable ; not to a purity, and minute exactness or interference that would be an evil from the perplexity of its fineness and mul tiplicity, but that which is obviously the good and practicable. And men are so dependent on each other for their good that private vices, as such matters alluded to, may be called, are, to which we have alluded, cannot be separated from their duties of life towards others, in what is the good weal of society. But supposing such did not affect the rights of others, then individu als must be left to themselves, on their own prudence and wisdom must they depend as their monitor or guide, and to their con-"], [97, "79 IN REGARD TO OBJECTIONS. science, and the inward and higher calls of religion. And as they can reconcile their actions, consistent with reason, which it has pleased the Almighty to endow man with, for his better guide and direction than mere brute instincts, appetites, and passions. It is to these resources men must be ever left on such occasions, and that they are left, where their actions apparently affect not others, or others in a way to be cognizable to men and the laws, or thought fit to be made cognizable to the laws. It is in private life, it is commonly said, a man is his own director, and for his conduct as regards himself and himself alone, he must take the course he chooses, subject to his own good sense and his con science and religion. But it is so very difficult to conceive a man's actions in some way or other shall not affect others in the rights granted of their good, that his conduct cannot be separated from his duties in life, meaning his duties towards others in respect of their good, either by example or indirectly, though not of direct effect, and all private vices, though most affecting himself, are always the sub ject of the approval of men, or the contrary, their deprecation, proving that men do think they have a claim on ; and, therefore, a right to judge of the good or evil conduct of men, though more applicable to private life, than affecting society. Where, how ever, such are ostensible and flagrant they are made the subject of laws, and proving that men do consider private vices as affect ing society, or which society has a right to interfere in, as drunk enness, swearing, or bad words, or expressions of obscenity, seduc tion and riotous proceedings, though confined to the parties in competition, as quarrels, fighting duels, and party rencounters, cruelty to animals, and perhaps many other instances might be mentioned. But laws and interference cannot be carried into every transaction or action of a man's life, and (except where such are outrageous, and flagrant, and evidently the good of society, and, in the term good of society, evidently points out that the rights of a man are considered their good, is affected to a degree fit for the interference of men) must be left to the rational moni tor of their mind, and conscience, and religious duties. But, when men reflect that they grant each other their right"], [98, "80 THE JUDGMENT CONSIDERED to good, and how this is related, connected, and involved, with every thing concerning or affected by men, human actions, or human agency. How much this depends in property, especially, and upon laws and government. Then, if men will thus re flect, they must see directly that every act of men in society will more or less affect one another, either directly or latently, and rights granted, the obligation of men to regard and have con sideration of each other's good exists in whatever this relates to or concerns, or may concern it ; in which the actions of one man may be concerned with, or any way affect another. Now, what men are pleased to refer to, or term the private virtues or vices of men, it will be found, on examination, ap ply to nothing more than that conduct with regard to themselves, and their property, which shall effect, or have a tendency to effect good or evil ; or the benefit or injury of others. Drunkenness, for instance, indulged privately is prejudicial to health, and a man deprived of his senses or unduly excited commits many foolish actions. The example is bad, and in all that he does foolishly or prejudices his own substance, he injures those dependent on him, or who may more or less be dependent or interested in a due management of his property. The like may be said of a man wantonly and foolishly extravagant, and when reduced to want and charity he becomes a burthen on others. Intentional false hood or lying, when affecting others, needs no comment on its being an injury, however trifling, to the rights of others, in what is their good; but where (if possible) it does not affect others, it is a mean and despicable habit, and bad, because, as habit may become practice and ultimately affect others, and in most serious ways. All other acts and propensities, however privately indulged or given way to, where the interests of others are affected, or may become so by the practice hurtfully, are wrongs done the rights of others ; and it cannot be otherwise, for all right and wrong re latively is so adjudged one or the other, from the relation of the act to rights, which are granted or given by men to one another in their judgment and estimation of what is good. Men should reflect that their rights to good is granted generally in the appro bation of men of what is good, and that the duties are commensu rate with these ; and that, if their rights to good in every respect"], [99, "IN REGARD TO OBJECTIONS. 81 are granted, then are duties imposed in the observance of every thing that is good. Personal rights have least, perhaps, to do with what may affect others, that is, a man as to his own person may be said may have more controul over himself, independent and without regard to others, than over any thing else ; expecially where a man's act only directly affects himself, and does not directly injure or hurt the person or property of another. Yet here his moral example, as to his own good, shall be of consequence to the good of others ; and in doing that which is of prejudice to himself, though ap- parently prejudicial to himself alone ; yet if the act is a precedent or example of moral evil, being what is injurious to human beings, he is doing that which, by example, may affect others and preju- dice to the right to good men grant to each other, and his obli- gations cannot be separated from his actions. But how much more shall a man's act, with regard to property, affect others and his acts, in consequence, affect their rights. In Property, men relinquish what is or may be of use, and essential for their own good, and create a right in another to that requisite for their own good, and thereby raising in such right a good which is to be extended to others by the management, use, and employment of that the right to which is so given. As will every act in regard to Property as it is more well-managed, or as a man's acts in the use of it be moral or otherwise, will it affect the good of others and their rights ; and a moral and good use of it shall be a duty owed to society or the rights of others in what concerns their good. The every act of men cannot be regarded as subjects for the controul, or rather regulation of the municipal law, but their duty in rights granted and inseparable from them, will be to do good and render in obedience to the rights of men to their good, all the good they can ; and the better way of acting, obvious and practicable, will be that required of men, and will ever be the subject of human estimation, criticism, and observation, and more or less regarding such, will men be judged by one another; and though only considered as thoughtless or needless, and the most trivial sentiments of reproof, or deficiency of esteem as an act or condu ct, is passed, such is nevertheless the pass- G"], [100, "82 THE JUDGMENT CONSIDERED ing sentence on their conduct, and evidence of men's judgment, and of the rights men have, and therefore exercise and pass their judgment on all human acts, because all men are affected by such, however slightly or trivially or indirectly, even if it be only as opposed to right or wrong in human judgment, or estimation, and the feeling experienced in accord or not to this, even in mere matter of opinion. But every man's act, and every act of man, as it may more concern himself, and not affect others in a manner to be regarded by them as injurious to them, or to the society, will be a matter of very little concern to others ; and if a man choose to indulge in gluttony like a brute beast, or turn the beneficial purpose of his Creator in reason to promote the brute character, more than a rational being, keeping it to himself; or to be miserly and deny himself the requisites for his health and comfort; the world will have very little care for this, save where his gratification, or his denial, or his avarice obviously and oppressively prejudices the good of society. But I have shewn man to be a religious being, by his moral powers, or through his peculiar nature, and as man, therefore, he is bound by his mind or conscience, to observe or follow that which is in reason, correct or right as concerns men, and himself as man, and a moral being, in all he does, whether as concerns him self, or relates to others. There is, in truth and reality, therefore, no deficiency in the moral power or the judgment, as the law of man, in subjecting him to the wholesome controul of religion. The human judgment being then, the law or authority of men, which we must consider it, is, from all we can see, and which I have here stated, is it not important, I ask, to enquire into and know the mode of its procedure; or, as we may say, the creature man possessing that power, proceeds in using it ; or what it sanc tions or authorizes men to do. The judgment determines the moral good and evil. The de cision marks or stamps the one, or the other ; for we, morally viewing the subject, do not admit, or cannot see, good or evil but what the judgment says is so. And in those estimations, and according to the degree of either, as may be merited, is honour and reward, or condemnation and punishment, awarded."], [101, "IN REGARD TO OBJECTIONS. 83 As applied to man in approving his good, it gives him his rights; and in them, the rule of his direction; by which he esti mates all relative good, and the contrary ; or the good and evil as resting with men; or in other words, the moral good and evil; for in the respect of which rights, the moral good consists ; and on the contrary, or disregard of which, or offence to them, the moral evil. A man may be inclined to his good, but how does he shew his title to it. By a knowledge of his judgment as the law, which does give him claim by approving his good? But if he does not see this is his law, to what else does he ascribe his claim to his good ? By the laws ! And what as authority to the laws ? Na ture! And this; or his rights founded, as supposed, or assumed; is the best explanation hitherto men have given of their claim to their good. But in the judgment, he has the plainer mode; and the plainer mode, because it is the truth, and the fact, that it is the law which does direct him; or on which he acts, And it ap proves the good, the good as to man, and therefore gives it to him, sanctions and justifies him in it, and all he does to support and maintain his claim. And this approval is, his rights. But this is not all he obtains, having attained this truth, or fact; for by the same truth or fact, or knowledge of his rights, he finds his rule or limit prescribed for his proceeding in his claim for that good; and he finds in his rights, his duties are raised and im posed by the same law or authority; and by the same act, or procedure, that gives him his rights; and he only takes them with the duties attached to them, in the regard and consideration it imposes on him for the rights of others, of all men. The law on which men act, and the rules it gives them for their direction, appears to me, and surely will be allowed by every one to be the first and most important subject of human consideration, and for men to know. Rights as the important subject to men, on which they pro mote and justify their claim to their good, and respect and con sideration in that which it concerns, and the duties of men in such respect are raised, as these rest or depend upon, or are de rived from the authority of the human judgment, I propose to consider in the next argument. a 2"], [102, "84 THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT ARGUMENT III. THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT AS THE SOURCE OF RIGHTS. All, or most authors, in treating of the basis of laws and moral right and wrong, or what we may term first principles, are in fact, only accounting for, or explaining the ground or reason of respect or consideration of men, as the source or authority upon which all laws are founded, and moral right and wrong arises, men are judged by, and their proceedings are justified in such respects. This respect or consideration due to men, is therefore, we may consider, as the first principle with these writers. But the cir cumlocution used to explain and support their doctrines, are so involved and prolix, few can, or are disposed to read them; few feel satisfied when they have read them; many know nothing of them ; and of those that do read them, after they have waded through the masses of lore and logic, the entire, or with few exceptions, rest more upon their ideas founded on the obvious and intelligible object of the human good, or the benefit or service of man, being under whatever view may be taken of the subject, the reason for the adoption of good and rejecting evil. The first principles I conceive, can mean, or be, no more or less, than the rights of men. For if men have rights, in what it must be presumed, is the object with all, as their lives and wel fare, or their good, then all the rest follows as to the sanction and justification of laws and acts that are effective of their good, or that are founded to meet the various circumstances of human affairs, for that purpose. But if men have no rights, then the respect and consideration of men, and all laws and argument to sustain the good of man, fall to the ground. For then it would be difficult to see what"], [103, "AS THE SOURCE OF RIGHTS. 85 claim men have to their good, or rationally concern themselves for the regard of mankind. As the latter position has no recognition with me, I shall not comment on it; but refer to the former, that of men having rights. And I think it will be evident to all men that rights comprehend all the ground and result, and the real object of the arguments of authors for the respect and consideration of men, and on which they build their ideas of moral right and wrong, or what is proper or not as regards man, and found all laws for the protection and regard of mankind. Resolved therefore into rights, as all the observations and ar- guments of moralists and ethical philosophers finally lead to, and as their results are in fact founded upon, I think it is a more plain matter and ready mode of treating the subject of the basis of all laws, civil law I mean, and of moral right and wrong, to establish rights as the first principles and ground work of respect of man, and of all laws and government, and the estimate of every concern of man affected by moral means, or through human power or agency. And in the hope of producing a more correct notion, or by shewing the truth or fact of the rights claimed by men, I trust I shall satisfy every one on this head, and give them just ideas, that they may clearly and facilely understand the sub ject; and that the facts evidently made to appear, they may at once see and readily recognize proper views of their moral course and duties in life ; and proceed as well to correct any errors they may have formed, or imbibed, and prevent such as they might fall into, for want of accurate ideas of the first principles or ground whence they proceed in all that concerns or relates to man, as that may or does depend, or rest, with human powers or agency. Authors have drawn their principles, or founded the rights of men from nature. We contest this, and hope and think we can and do shew this to be an erroneous idea, or mistake; and that it is the cause of all their difficulty in reconciling what a rule or law deduced from nature would give to man, or authorize them to assume, with that which is practicable; and is really that principle of good and justice which seems to pervade the minds of all men in estimating what is right and wrong morally, or as as-"], [104, "86 THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT fecting men. But therefore resting on nature as their authority, they find a difficulty in reconciling nature's law with that which is requisite to meet the cases of human exigency, and the ideas pervading all men of what they consider as good. Hence they are driven to qualify their principles as they do with rules and cautions opposed to, or inconsistent with, nature. And when they deduce their rights, they, as immediately, and I may add, abruptly, are forced to appeal to reason for the rule most at va riance with their principles, being directly opposed to them, and adopt the rule in contradiction, as, that no man has a right to injure or prejudice another in their persons and their civil rights; and are fain to shew that the rights of nature are restricted, and must be understood with all the modifications requisite for civil society, and all its relations. All which is perfectly true, but it is a difficult matter, their doctrine being at variance with, and in contradiction of itself, to draw or give men a right from nature, and immediately restrict it with the bondage of reason, and the trammels of civil society. Perplexed to reconcile the opposing principles; the modes, and rules of limit are not made very per spicuous, so as to be acknowledged off hand by him who is fas cinated with the licence afforded to his views in the first instance in the law of nature. I take man as he is a moral creature, endued with mind, com posed of reflection, reason, and judgment, and come at once to the judgment of man to give him his rights. And if the judg ment of man does not give him his rights, I know not on what pretension of reasoning, the authority men can claim, or found, and justify any good or any proceedings for the maintaining or pro moting their lives, their welfare, or their happiness. Surely if men will but once reflect, that what proceeds from them as man, is only recognized as that which characterizes him as mind ; what his judgment therefore, as a rational being, approves, is that which alone he has sanction or authority for ; he must see and admit that gives him whatever he can claim or pretend to, and feel justified in assuming or asserting. It only remains to see considerately, what this does give him, and a reference to facts will at once satisfy his mind, and explain the first rule that go verns all his proceedings."], [105, "AS THE SOURCE OF RIGHTS. 87 The distinction shortly is this. Imagining rights to be founded in nature, there is no limit in what a man may do, having power, but by interposing reason to consider what is good for men in their relations of a social state. By founding rights in the moral powers of men or reason in what that approves, it is apparent they are the subject originally of limit in the human judgment, in the requisite consideration for them. Referring to my own views, and resting on the human judg ment as the law of all human proceedings, there is no occasion here to enter upon or discuss the doctrines or modes of these writers, who draw their first principles from nature; although I shall have occasion to advert hereafter to the error of such notion, in illustration of the principle of moral rights, and of their being founded on the human judgment, and not on mere nature. And I therefore, proceed at once to the consideration of the law of the human judgment as giving man his rights. In referring to the human judgment as the law of man, we are looking to the discernment and decision of a rational creature. In the necessity there is for any enquiry into the law which go verns or directs man, it is not that man has not made use of his reason, and has not been guided and directed by it. But the manner it has been used, and the proper use of it, is a subject that we shall find in our enquiry, a matter fit for our investigation, and most important as it concerns us. It is not, I say, therefore, that man has not been governed or directed, by his reason, that the enquiry is proposed, because even the wild savage makes use of his reason in furtherance of his objects and views, and necessarily must do so. For man, as a reasonable creature, must ever be directed by it, more or less rightly, or to his advantage, and otherwise. In the savage we shall find the reason directing the man to the supply and attainment of his wants and necessities. We may find it raising up rules and customs, under the idea no doubt originating in their use and benefit for his guide, direction, or observance. But we shall find it more employed for the aid and assistance in the immediate object of his wants, and promoting any object or views that may be of use, or which may be con ceited as of use, or for his observance ; or effecting as rules and"], [106, "88 THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT customs what he may have conceited for his observance, or ac quired among those with whom he lives, from them who may have preceded him. But we shall not find the human mind en quiring into its own nature, its use, and properties ; and apply ing the reason to mark or institute what ought to be the pursuits of man drawn from the facts of his own nature, arrived at upon such enquiry ; and proceeding thence from the dictates of his mind and reason upon what it discovers as right or proper, and, therefore, ought to do ; instead of following or aiding the instinc tive prompters of his action in his common wants and necessities, his appetites, and passions, and the prejudices with which he has been embued. It is a very different thing the progress of man in life, using and applying his reason to promote the wants and necessities of his nature ; and finding out and instituting a course or purpose to pursue, certainly agreeable or consistent with his nature ; but that nature in what may be agreeable or consistent with itself in its moral or rational constitution, or harmoniously ; and not wild or reckless of what he finds is the true and healthful course for him to pursue, pointed out by reason in his enquiry, as promot ing the true objects or interests of his nature, or his being, and the better modes of its obtainment. In the one case, man is the creature little more than of his animal instincts and passions, and using his reason to supply them. In the other, the intellect expands, enquires its purpose as to the creature possessing it, and directs the creature by the judgment's own ordering and direction. In the former, man is moved more by his instinctive animal nature and conceits. In the latter he becomes more a creature of mind, and thence amoral and civilized being. Men, in applying their powers of enquiry and discernment to extraneous things, as matters of art, or science, or philosophy generally, not moral, will generally pursue the course they dis cover to be right or correct in regard to the subject matter of consideration, and where they may have to act, or to adopt any measures, in respect to such. But, in moral philosophy, that which they see to be correct or they approve is opposed often times to the interests of individuals, their wants and their wishes"], [107, "AS THE SOURCE OF RIGHTS. 89 and desires. That approved being according to a rule generally applicable to men, while that which concerns the individual with out reference or regard of others, necessarily is oftentimes at variance with what is generally applicable to men, or the rule of consideration of one another in the relationship of society. This is the occasion of all human misdoings, in regard to one another, and is the reason why men, though they will observe what philosophy points out to be right in other things, they will not always observe that which moral philosophy points out ; their interests or desires as individuals drawing them away, or raising inclinations opposite to moral approvement, which can only be a rule of general application concerning men. But although men may err from the failings, or what we may term the vice, in their inclinations or desires ; yet, in what re gards the rule of their conduct, they will not fail through igno rance, or error, or mistaken notions by attaining a more correct or scientific knowledge of the moral law, and the rule it gives them, and sanctions them in. And we may hope correct knowledge as to their law and rule, may lead us to expect a better conduct and regulation of all moral concerns, and observance of what can only be considered as morally proper for men. Our business is to exhibit the law of man of the human judg ment, and the way in which it acts or proceeds, by giving men their rights, and in them a rule for his direction ; and the advan tages that appear will be resulting from this enquiry, will be to clear away many errors that men have fallen into, or that are pre valent, as to the course or modes of action for the moral progress or government of men in life ; and which errors must always serve to mislead or confound men in their ideas and notions, as to what is morally right or not, and perplex their judgment in its decision ; the difficulties occasioned by which can only be certainly corrected by proceeding on right principles or notions only to be obtained by the judgment itself studying and seeing its course of procedure for the direction of men, the being pos- sessing it. Among the advantages resulting from the enquiry on the law of the human direction, the first important thing is, the establish ment of the rights of men, or what we term the moral rights as"], [108, "90 THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT proceeding from his moral powers in his judgment ; and correct ing the error of rights, being supposed to be derived from, or to exist in nature. The next thing will be to explain that difficult thing, satisfactorily to make out and reconcile in practice, as to equality of rights. By shewing that equality of rights does not comprehend equality of good. And the universally admitted truth of equality of rights is perfectly reconciled in practice ; while it having been supposed, or being supposed by some, to include equality of good, which is impracticable, it has not been reconcileable in the practice of life, as in the conduct of individu als as regards one another, and government, and the laws, and institutions of society. But, mixed together in men's minds, as equality of rights and equality of good have been, it has oc casioned much confusion and difficulty in forming the opinion and judgment of men in considering the subject of equality of rights or equal claims of men ; witnessed in the ideas of Agrarian laws \u2014 partition of property, Moravian institutions, and schemes of common joint societies of labour, &c, and finally the judgment being the law of man, it enables us to consider the exceptions in the human conduct in what is not practicable as compatible with ad hering to the rule of rights, under the circumstances men are required to submit to in obedience to the laws instituted for the regulation of human concerns, and the governing, order, and peace of men and society, or the civil laws and institutions. At the same time only so far as the law requires men's obedience ; but where such are not imperative, leaving men to the rule of the moral rights or good or the law of human judgment. These matters will necessarily be interspersed with observa tions, and considerations, offering themselves in our enquiry on the human judgment, as the law directing men ; but these are the chief matters that will offer for our consideration, and on which I expect the advantages will be particularly seen, or derived, from the enquiry proposed. In the term rights, the plural is used, as applying to every thing as concerns man where the term is used. Rights, in the common acceptation or application of the term, meaning any specific matter, or subject, of claim or title which is assented to, or agreed upon, or admitted as approved in the"], [109, "AS THE SOURCE OF RIGHTS. 91 human judgment, as rights of a man to his person, his lands, house, goods or merchandize, or any other definite object, thing, or matter, and which are assented to, or assumed to be so, is the sense in which the term is used, or applied here. Rights of men, in respect of their good, generally comprehends whatever that good may be in, or consist of; but applied to any particular good, is a specific application, or use of the term ; notwithstanding the term good, is one of very general comprehension or application ; therefore, the term though applied generally to good, referring to any particular thing which is so, is specific as to that particular; for the object, thing, or matter, to which it is applied, denotes its specific use, or meaning. I have merely made this notice of the application of the term, to prevent any wilful mistake in applying the use of the term rights ; but under no apprehension but every reader of common observation or knowledge, will well know its use or meaning not to mistake it. On the human judgment as the law of men giving men their rights. \u2014 I consider that rights, in a moral sense, are an approval or esteem of men; and that nothing more is meant by them, than what ought to be, or is just, and proper, as regards men in their reasonable judgment, or opinion. And by rights it is not meant, nor are they alluded to, as, an existence or being of materiality or substance, such as life, or limb, or property, or things, or acts done, or to be done, or observances regarding these, or the measure of consideration of rights, such as justice. Rights, being but the claim or title to these things in moral esteem, or what ought to be, as regards or concerns men, as to the things to, or of which rights refer, but not the things them selves, are that subject we refer to, or bring under our consider ation. It is true, people use the term in common phraseology, of a man's Life or person, or his Property being his rights, and of Justice being a man's right. But I consider, we do not mean that rights are one and the same thing with Life, Property, or Justice ; but merely mean by such terms, that the things referred to, are the subjects of his, man's, rights \u2014 that is, that a man has a right to his Life, his Property, and Justice, or these are what men approve or esteem in their judgment. Such right, then, is"], [110, "92 THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT a distinct thing from the matter, thing, or substance, or act, it refers to. It is clear this must be the case, because a man's Life of itself, could never give him a right ; neither could a house, or land, his Property, give a man his right to it ; nor could Justice, give him his right to fair and equal consideration. And these things, do not give him rights, is evident, because, were a man's rights given by them, or depended on them, if these things, namely, his Life, Property, or Justice, were prejudiced, or taken away, his rights would be prejudiced, or gone with them. Now, a man may suffer an injury in his person, his life may be endan- gered, or himself deprived of liberty ; yet his right to his person, and his life, and his liberty, exist, however he may be assailed or prejudiced in these respects. So of his house, his house may be taken from him, or destroyed, his right to it, or compensation yet exists. And so of justice, which may be denied him, or be unattainable, yet his right to it exists. Or he could never claim either one or the other of these things, in which he suffered a wrong, or be justified in attempting to regain his losses, or to obtain redress for the injuries he sustained. A man's rights, thus, it is seen, exist, although the subject of them may be pre judiced, or taken away, or destroyed, and they must, therefore, be a distinct thing, or matter, from the subject of them. I have thus endeavoured to satisfy the mind of any reader, who may not so readily enter into the position, that rights are not one and the same with the things they refer to, or the subjects of them ; but are a separate and distinct matter ; and I hope I have been successful : as it is important for a proper consideration, or understanding of the subject discussed, that the distinction should be kept in view, as will hereafter be seen, when we come to consider their ground or authority. And I therefore hope, those who more readily see and enter into the correctness of the position just stated, namely, that rights are a moral sense, but not the things they relate to, or concern, will excuse this little detention from the main business of the work, by going through this previous exposition on the point, to which we have just adverted. Good, the moral good, in the lives of men, their benefit, and happiness, as this may depend on, or rest with men in their"], [111, "93 AS THE SOURCE OF RIGHTS. actions, or be any way affected by human agency, it is considered with reasonable men is the object of their regard or esteem. But the good, or the benefit of men, cannot be claimed, or promoted, with the recognition of men, without they have a right to it. Unless men have a right to their good, men can have no claim or title to be regarded, or respected, in what is their good ; and it is apprehended, that unless men have rights in therecognition or consideration of one another, they cannot, in the estimation of men, be liable to wrongs, or suffer any wrongs ; for wrongs are known only by the taking away, denying, or injuring men in their rights. Wrongs are only known, or understood to mean what is opposed to rights, and, therefore, if men had no rights, they could suffer no wrongs. Thus, persons might be assaulted, their Lives endangered or taken away ; if they had Property, such also might be assailed or taken ; and Justice, if they called for it, might be denied them : and these things might occur without being considered wrongs done to men, for which those who did them were responsible : but men have rights (we are speaking morally). They have, therefore, a claim or title to be regarded or respected in what is their good, and offences against this are considered wrongs, for which men are held responsible to one another for committing. The good of men, therefore, is acknowledged, and in this is the recognition of their rights. These giving them claim or title to respect or consideration in what is their good, and so far the duties of men raised in such respect or consideration of one another securing and promoting their good, it is considered the rights of men are the first and most important of all subjects for men to enquire into, and see how they are derived ; or to learn what is the authority upon which are founded, that which is so necessary to promote the object with all men of their good. Such are the short and plain reasons which have made me advert to moral rights. To this effect are former observations directed, and as here we are proceeding further in the subject, in order to throw light upon it, and elucidate the first law of man, we state the purpose of our enquiry, and trust these few introductory words are not inappropriate, and will be so considered by the reader."], [112, "94 THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT Rights, in the sense the word is here used as meaning claim or title, are what belong to, and are possessed by every man, and every man knows what they are, (we mean reasonable beings, and possessed of common sense or understanding,) that is, men know it is desirable, and that they ought to have, what is good, their own good, and which may be defined under the general heads of their Lives, their Property, and Justice. Men indeed may not have a proper or high consideration of their rights. These may not be sufficiently developed in their minds by reflection, and consideration, to see their high and just importance ; but what men possessing common sense and reason, shall not say, or shall not know, they ought to have or enjoy their Lives, their Property, and Justice ; or be respected or regarded in these, as far as rests with men, and as such may be affected either beneficially or otherwise, by the acts or consideration of other men. We say therefore, in the common terms used by us all, these are men's rights, that all men know them, and in the esti mation of all men they are what should be, as much as they may be dependent on men. I have considered these observa tions I have made required, preparatory to the introducing the enquiry as to the derivation of rights which I propose to show, and which observations I hope will not be thought unnecessary or use less, and that the reader will pardon my occupying his time on them. The QUESTION I propose is, how do men derive rights, and what is their authority ? Unimportant it may appear to some at first sight, not reflecting on the force and utility of a just sense, or a correct knowledge of moral facts. And assuming the fact that they have rights, and acting or proceeding upon that as sumption, it may be thought sufficient for the world, or the mass of mankind to proceed without troubling themselves with the moral explanation, or exposition, of the ground upon which their rights rest. The object here is the explanation upon which men rest their right, or assume the fact that they are entitled to their Lives, their Property, and to Justice, and respect and considera tion regarding these things ; for without such respect, or considera tion of one another, or the duties of men towards each other, to respect Life, Property, and Justice, the right is a mere word with out reality, as to the matters to which they refer."], [113, "AS THE SOURCE OF RIGHTS. 95 That explanation in such matters has not been thought indif ferently of, or of no consequence, by all mankind, as we have ob served on a former occasion, the subject of morals and moral explanations, have engaged the attention of the learned, and most profound philosophers of all ages, and of all countries. Our own country affords numerous and eminent proofs, and examples. Among many others, are the illustrious Locke, and that great moral ist and divine, Paley. And though we do not presume to emulate any that have gone before us in the field of moral enquiry, we may yet be permitted to make use of the road they have prepared. The road they have opened of moral disquisition, conformable with plain reason and common sense ; and I hope by travelling the road of these great authorities to accomplish my own task, and by the truth and plainness of the foundation of morals on human au thority, in rights, to render the subject plain and systematic ; and to cast away the mystery that renders the subject perplexed, and still darkens the understandings of men. Have the writers on morals and moral doctrine done no service to the cause ? I consider they have ; and most essentially con tributed to the expansion and liberality of mind and intellect of the present day. Superstition, divine rigrfts, and preposterous power, pre-eminence and usurpation of rights and privileges, claimed both by institutions, and individual men, above their fellow creatures, have been dissipated before moral truths; and men have learnt to claim a more common consideration of regard, as belonging to one and the same class of creatures blessed apparently as the more favoured upon the earth. This has been done already. What if we can, proceeding upon the same path of exposition according to reason and common sense, satisfy men of the authority of rights, render the authority easy of comprehension, and evident to the senses of the most dull, and least apprehensive, that shall render more plain and palpable the claims of men ; and with those claims their duties ; that shall tend to reclaim mankind from the wild and fierce and malignant passions of our mere animal nature, its licence, and exuberance, where injurious to itself: render men considerate in the highest degree of one another, and in fine more moral. Know ledge of the sanction and authority of rights, is the only certain"], [114, "96 THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT way of accomplishment of the more just, and the higher estimate of their claims with reasonable beings. And to give, therefore, men the more correct knowledge of their rights, and their duties, in Tegard to what they are founded on, arise, and exist ; to see the facts or truths, for their justification; seems to me, the most essential measure to found further improvement : and better at tain the end and object of all human labours, that of good, in the human welfare, and happiness. To exalt the moral character, and above all, to exalt the mind of the creature in admiration, but with humility, and fullness of gratitude to the Creator. I have considered that rights are founded on the human judg ment, and propose here more particularly to enter into the enquiry of his judgment being the authority of man for his rights. Rights, as that claim or title men have or assume that they have or ought to have to their good, which being a general term, I will for more certain defining and directing men's attention to the subject of their rights included under this term, more specifically describe to be, 1st, Their Life, comprehending under this, their person, their mind, their body, limbs, speech, their faculties, freedom of action, or liberty, and enjoyment of these, or happiness. \u2014 2dly. Property, as the produce or gain of a man's labour, and industry, his hire, his wages, the produce of these, and of his ingenuity. Land, and the creatures, and fruits, and all its various products, including food, raiment, clothing, huts, houses, and shelter, and all things agreed or understood to be appropriated. \u2014 And 3dly, Justice, as a fair and equal con sideration or respect of men, in their rights to their Life and Property, on a due regard of circumstances, or what is called an equality of rights. Life and Property in those things I have re ferred to or included under their meaning, comprehend whatever is of good to man in substance or materiality, and justice that consideration or regard in the views or mind of man, and his acts relative to these things or matters of Life and Property. And his good, the object of men's rights consist of these things. These things being obviously the good of men, and that of which it consists, may be designated by the term of, good. The rights then of men to this good, or those things which have been noticed as being obviously so, under which we may consider it"], [115, "97 AS THE SOURCE OF RI&HTS. more definitely ; and to which assuming or supposing they have rights, men justify themselves, and their acts in such respect. What or whence do these rights proceed from, or what is their authority ; or whence the claim or title or justification of men in respect of their rights ? A man's rights to these things termed his good, or which we call the rights of men to good, as rest with themselves, or depend ent on their means, their powers, or agency, consist or can only be in the approvement of them by men. Rights are what men consi der ought to be, and what ought to be is that which they ap prove ; and this in respect of themselves, as the subject of their consideration, or morally as rational beings, is that which is agreeable or consistent, with the subject of their consideration, themselves, or that which is their good ; therefore by men approv ing their good, consist the rights of men. The means or power of men's approvement is their judgment. The judgment being the decision of the moral powers of man in his mind, his reflection, and reason, and other properties of which the mind consists. The judgment is the action of the mind, or the decision of a reasonable being of what he approves or rejects ; and considers, being approved, he should, or ought to adopt, and act according to, as rests with him, or he has the power or means of acting, in what is consistent with, or in agreement with the subject or object his mind or moral powers are directed to, or' under consideration. This, in regard to man, or morally, is his good. Rights, being that which is approved, in men's judgment they exist, they exist in their esteem, or favourable opinion. In the human mind therefore or the moral powers, which in its action or decision is known as the judgment, is raised or derived their rights ; and such is their source, as originating them ; and the sanction and authority of man for them. The claim and title of men to their good is in their rights ; and their rights, and claim and title in them to their good, are a matter purely of the existence, or creation, of their mind, or their moral powers ; and not of any other matter or thing as we can see in this enquiry. That they do not exist, if they were not approved is certain ; for if men considered they had no rights, then there could be no H"], [116, "98 THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT reason or occasion to respect or have consideration of men as a measure due, or that ought to be ; and there would be no claim or title of men to any good, or respect, or consideration ; and if he did not approve his good as rested or depended on him, man ; and did not consider it as what ought to be, or he should have, then, he could have no right in human judgment or estimation. Whether they do exist men themselves must judge ; for men alone can have cognizance of their judgment ; and they must de cide whether that judgment approves or not of the good, the human good, their own good ; but as rational beings they can not deny, or say otherwise than, that their judgment approves the good, or that which is in conformity with, or agreeable to, their own being, or what is consistent. It therefore must be evident that man, as a rational being, and meaning in this term the whole race, sees and acknowledges, that he raises, and has his rights in his approving judgment of the good ; and neither to laws, or to nature ; but in the moral dis cernment and powers which characterize him ; and he ought most gratefully to feel the pre-eminence which he enjoys over every other earthly thing in being, constituted as he is a moral being ; and to fulfil the office designed by the Great Author of the uni verse in his moral powers, he should endeavour to see what they point out, or direct him in ; and observe, in whatever is practi cable ; as his reason, the great characteristic of his powers, and of himself, over every other creature ; sees and approves. This is what remains with a moral being to perform ; and what we in drawing him to a consideration of what high authority and eminence he has in his moral means developed, cannot leave him in the summit of his power, without suggesting. On this exposition of the law of the human judgment, I feel justified in saying in answer to the QUESTION, that men for the authority of their rights, whence they are derived, and exist ; I think it must be most evident upon the considerations that men can give the subject, that they are raised and exist or are derived from, and granted by, the power or through the means, of their judgment ; and I hope, considering the importance of rights to man, that I may be excused in stating more logically the mode of deriving moral rights."], [117, "AS THE SOURCE OF RIGHTS. 99 Let us consider then man as he is, a being endowed with mind or reason, consisting among a variety of powers and qualities, of perception, reflection, thought, imagination, and judgment. The power and action of his mind we comprehend under his judgment, as the decision of a reasonable being, as he, man is ; and in re gard to what he approves, or rejects, or does or ought to do, ac cordingly. \u201e The character and property of reason is its discernment of what agrees with, or is consistent, or harmonizes, with the subject con sidered, or that the mind directs itself towards ; and such is right, and proper, and good, or so esteemed in regard to the ob ject under consideration. Man a reasonable creature with judg ment, in moral consideration or applying his mind to himself, considering himself the subject matter of his consideration, and regard, being that we comprehend as moral, or as morals what concerns man, he approves that which is agreeable or consistent with himself, man, the subject of his consideration, and what, therefore, is consistent with himself, man, his own being or exist ence, and welfare. Such is good, in his meaning of that term ; and man as a reasonable being acting by his judgment, therefore approves his good. And it would be absurd in a reasonable be ing to do otherwise, or for man to reject or condemn what was good, such being a contradiction to what he approves, or con siders is good, and in reason ought to be as rests with him, being beneficial or consistent with his being or .existence ; therefore on all reasonable consideration within the compass of his moral means or power, good is that which is approved by man ; and the moral good in practice, that which concerns man, and rests or depends on the acts of man, affected or any way controllable by him or human agency. The judgment of men morally, or with regard to the discern ment and decision of the mind, is the same with their opinion, or esteem, therefore, we may say, they use these terms in common with his judgment, in designating the authority for his rights. The good of man is the subject of his rights, which we are considering, and in his approbation of his good, consist his rights, or the approvement of his good, as moral and reasonable man ; for they exist in his esteem, or approbation of what ought to be h2"], [118, "100 THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT as regards him. And in what else but his esteem, his good opi nion, or his judgment, can that rest or exist which applies to himself, and is dependent on him as ought to be, but his judgment that it should be, is consistent, right, and proper ? The answer to this necessarily affirms, that rights, are the ap proving judgment of man, as a reasonable being, of his good ; and in that, they consist. It will bs apparent to every one, in what has been stated, that what man approves by his judgment, is deemed, or decided, in the estimation of him as what ought to be ; and his good being that in his estimation, or favourable judgment, should be, or ought to be, as respects or concerns him, man. This is the origin or foundation of rights ; which are, the esteem of man in his judgment in favour of his good, or that which he approves concerning himself, man. And thus are raised or derived the rights, or claim, or title of man, to his Life, his Property, and Justice. Rights are nothing more than human esteem, or the judgment of man, in regard to himself; considering himself as the subject of his consideration ; and the decision of the moral powers in his mind by his judgment towards, or in favour of himself. They, rights, are therefore, it will be plain and evident, the human judgment in approbation of itself, man, and of that which concerns itself. The claim or title of man to his good, is one and the same with his rights in this respect, namely, to his good, morally speaking ; or as that which arises, or flows from the human powers of mind, and recognition or acknowledgment by that moral power. I consider, therefore, there can be no doubt or question in the mind of reasonable or reflecting man, that his rights are raised, or derived from, and granted, by his judgment, approving the good ; for his judgment approving it, is a moral admission, or consent, to it, as that which ought to be as concerns man ; on which decision he acts, or proceeds to consider his good, and justifies or maintains the justness or correctness of his actions, and conduct, in regard to it. And by this judgment approving the good, he condemns and deprecates the contrary, or that which"], [119, "AS THE SOURCE OF RIGHTS. 101 is injurious and offensive to man, or hurtful to his good, his rights; or the subject of them, the good, more definitely de scribed, of his Life, his Property, and Justice, and he does so as a reasonable being, as what is consistent in moral consider ation, or himself the subject matter of his thought or regard, in that which concerns such subject, or man. What else is the spring or source of his moral estimations, and of his actions in correspondence ; but this judgment approving that which is his good, and condemning the contrary ? For in his judgment he approves his good, and by that grants his rights, his claim, and title to his Life, his Property, and Justice, proceeds and justifies all his acts, and conduct, in conformity with it ; and deprecates and condemns the contrary. But where, or on what other ground that he can recognize, does man, of any motive or opinion that he can raise within himself, approve the good, or condemn the evil ? Morally, therefore, his judgment approving the good, grants man his rights ; and it is evident on the human judgment, and nothing else, do they rest or are derived from, or founded ; such, therefore, raises them, and is the source. By the approval of the good, man, therefore, grants his rights to it morally, as it may rest, or be dependent, on men, or affected by his power or agency. I have used again the term, that moral rights are granted, as on a former occasion ; and I use the term, as a more familiar mode of expression, to denote their origin and dependence on the human judgment. To shew that men do take their rights by the grant of them, in the judgment, opinion, or esteem of men ; (although I consider, that they have rights, or claim, or title, to their good, cannot be disputed, and is undeniable on the grounds before stated) yet the more fully and clearly to establish them, I shall, in the course of this Argument, call the attention of the reader, to some further observations on the subject of considering them to arise from, and to be supported by the human judgment, and to exhibit that, as the law of man, or human authority. Preparatory to entering upon the further observations, it may not be improper to advert to the fact, that rights do exist, and are known or acknowledged. That they do exist in men's minds, cannot be denied, or otherwise they are not known ; but they are"], [120, "102 THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT known, and, therefore, exist. I am only accounting for their ex istence, how derived ; and in their origin, the rule, they are for our direction, and that we may have correct notions of them. What, in fact, can determine for men is right or wrong, or should be, or should not be, as dependent on men, or morally, but their mind or judgment ? Or what can determine for man, for that depending upon him, but his judgment. This is a matter to be decided, upon the evidence of men's own minds, judging in regard to themselves, their powers, and modes of action, and, therefore, we can only put the question to them, and they must decide ; what, therefore, this decides, is his rule of discrimination or direction, whether that it relates to be proper or not, or should, or should not be, and his authority and sanction for all approved or condemned, and men are held responsible for, accordingly, it resting or depending on them. Their rights being in the approving judgment of that obvious good, or obviously requisite for their good, which none will deny or dispute, in their senses, and none can avoid seeing, if blessed with the least vestige of rational discernment. Men, therefore, in deciding upon their rights, as what ought to be, or that they have claim or title to their good, in their lives, their property, and justice, as matters resting, or dependent on themselves, or as far as they may rest with men, they, their rights, are evidently derived from that source, and what better, or other source than the rational decision, or judgment of men, there can exist, I repeat, it does not appear to us ; and such must be as firmly established to men, as it is possible for any thing to be that de- pends upon man, or his moral powers of his reason or under- standing, and his power of acting, or agency, according to his judgment, in this respect. It must be apparent, then, to every one who considers the least attentively, what has been said, that rights, as they rest with, or are dependent on men, in that which they concern, in their actions, to respect, and perform, or effect, by their decision or judgment in their favour, \u00bbr approval, or favourable esteem, or opinion, they are derived from, and take their source or authority in that judgment of men ; and that they can have no better or"], [121, "103 AS THE SOURCE OF RIGHTS. other, morally speaking, or be more firmly established to man, than through such means. By the commqn concurrence of all mankind in approving what is good, are rights given to all men, and men, in a knowledge of this, by their approving their good, are held bound by the grant of rights, and their duties arising from, and the result of rights. All men concur and agree in sentiment or their judgment as to their rights, and they are, therefore, granted by the concur rence of all men. That this is the fact, is evident in all men agreeing in judgment, esteem, or opinion of what is good. To exhibit that rights are thus granted by the concurrent testimony of all men to one another, let them consider that there is one common object that they refer to, apparently one and all, by common consent, to judge the good by, and that every thing considered right or wrong, or good or bad, relatively have refer ence to that object, such things may concern, by which, as they are more or less in accordance, or consistent with, they are esteemed good, and being the contrary, bad ; and consequently the act or thing that if perceived in agreement, or harmonizing, or consistent is approved, and deemed right, in relation to the subject considered, or if otherwise, is condemned and deemed wrong. Men judge, and commonly agree on this head, always, perhaps, it may be said, agree, on proper views and explanations of matters and circumstances connected. What is this that men refer to, and by which they judge what is good, and which cha racterizes whatever may be relatively good or bad, right or wrong; or what is it men mean by such an act or thing being good or bad, or right or wrong, in a moral view, or concerning man him self. Sure, no one will deny it is to themselves, men, or to man generally, implying the human race, that this reference is made ; or that it is to any thing else than what concerns man, his use or benefit, as the acts or things that may be, and to which they allude or judge of, may be agreeable to, or the contrary, that they deem right or wrong, or good or bad. But it is in referring to themselves, that as things are con sistent with their own nature and being, and agreeable to their feelings, that men overlook their authority for, or whence they derive their rights. Instead of discerning they are the approval of"], [122, "104 THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT their mind or judgment, or of the moral power of their discrimina tion and reason, on the feelings of nature and their necessities, men seem blind to the approval of what is consistent with, or agreeable to that nature, being the authority for what they do, or they ought to do, and they should have. They are in themselves the moral standard ; the object afford ing the means as a matter or thing, for their judgment approving, and approving to decide what is, or what is not in conformity or consistent with that matter or thing, man, himself. Which judgment gives them rights, or claim to what ought to be, or it approves. Hence there is one common and general agreement in what they decide, and while they all concur in their judgment, they forget, or rather never see, their authority in that judgment. Hence are the appeals made by men to nature, and often to imaginary beings and creations, and to doctrines, and principles of dogmatic and arbitrary assumption, to support the good; instead of drawing from truth, by study and scientific research, by enquiry and in vestigation of facts, and drawing reasonable inferences and con clusions from these; such as the good or benefit of man being what his judgment and reason confirms and sanctions, or approves and grants : and thus though all are governed or regulated by one common standard, and by one common authority, in moral good and evil; and all are concurring in sentiment and feeling, they often adopt an imaginary or a groundless base, instead of the plain fact of his, man's, own being or existence, and the authority of the human judgment in favour of that, and of moral appreciation of what is agreeable and consistent with his being. The concurrence of men approving the good, we may notice, makes moral rights common to all mankind, and belong to all men under such concurrent judgment, and thus all men are en titled to be respected in that which is called good in the rights they all possess to it; and being common to all mankind, is there fore a property in them which characterizes and distinguishes them. They, rights, in this respect, differ from civil rights, or what may be given by the laws, which are governed by localities, ob jects, and circumstances, they are framed for; and are frequently, though matters of common interest, nevertheless particular, and often partial ; even in their operation in regard as affects the moral"], [123, "105 AS THE SOURCE OF RIGHTS. rights, and so far opposed to them, but which matters will be adverted to under the consideration of government and laws. To prevent any confusion or mistake being made in regard to what is meant by rights being common, it may be proper to say, that I state them to be common, because as rights, they belong to all men, one the same as another; and in this respect, are equal in all : but this is not to be mistaken as the same with the good. Because though rights, and the claim and title, in men, are equal in all to their good ; yet that good itself may not be so ; and it is the right that is common and equal, and not the good. This must be evident on the simple fact, that we can never equal ize the good of mankind. It is a matter or position preposterous to suppose, and utterly impracticable. Although our rights we can equalize, being matters of consideration and regard to the good, which is the subject of men's rights. This is so important a point, and one so apt to be wrongly con sidered, and on which mistakes and confusion of men in moral considerations arise, that it will be a fit subject to be considered particularly; and will form, therefore, a subject for our consider ation of rights, which I shall advert to before closing this ar gument. That men should enjoy their Lives, their Property, and have justice; that they should be considered and respected in these things; all men may agree in, but they do not see that agree ment in approving their good, is their authority, and that it is sanctioned by the common concurrence of all mankind; and that the judgment is the means or law of them all in their decision, and thus their sanction and authority. But what claim or title has man to these, or has one man to impose a control or require a limit upon the act or conduct of another man, or of men to have the respect or consideration of his Life, his Property, and to Justice ; or in brief terms, to make them do good, and forbid and prevent the doing wrong or evil. For unless men have such right or claim, of what use is this dis cernment of what is good, unless it has their approval or favour able judgment in such respect. They approve of their good, and in that judgment it is, that their rights then arise, and do exist; and the authority of men for these rights, is in this judgment or"], [124, "106 THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT approval of what is good and their duties in respect of their rights. From the argument before stated, it may be observed in fine, that themselves in truth the Standard, or in fact the object, upon which their judgment and approval of that, agreeable or consistent with the consideration of man himself is given, that judgment is his authority, in whatever he does. Whatever is in agreement, or is consistent with this, the human being, in his judgment, is good in his esteem ; and hence is the decision of the relative rio-ht and wrong, and such is the moral authority for the adoption or rejection of every thing by man. Rights, therefore, raised and existing upon this foundation of human judgment for his good, and but upon this authority of men's judgment, such is their claim or title to their Lives, their Property, and to Justice, and upon men's judgment, opinion, or esteem of these things, do their rights proceed, or are derived, and do exist, and upon no other ground morally, as we can see or discern, and upon nothing else. The judgment of men as reasonable beings, as the law or au thority of man, it is clearly necessary therefore, that it should be fully and unreservedly enquired into and scrutinized in order the better to see and understand and appreciate it, for by it alone can he be sanctioned in any thing that he does ; and without satisfying the mind of this fact, it will not have its due weight with him : but he will, for supposed better and more certain rule, found his proceedings on arbitrary or imaginary doctrines, and be open to fallacious premises, although his own interests will incline him to his own good, the real object of morals; but for want of admit ting this more freely, and understanding his authority and sanc tion, by his judgment, establishing his rights and the corre sponding duties and regards, he will, until he does acquire this better knowledge, ever be liable to error and mis-direction. For his sanction and direction therefore, we enter into the na ture of the moral law, to endeavour to explain what it is the better and more certainly to direct him, man, in his object of good or what concerns the human benefit or welfare, according to his own peculiar nature in his moral powers of reason and human judg ment ; which I hope I have made evident to all."], [125, "107 AS THE SOURCE OF RIGHTS. But however undistinguished as the law of the human judg ment may have been, it is under this moral authority all men do act, however imperfectly in effect, or however imperfectly under stood, for it is from their esteem of what is held to be good, and the deprecation of the contrary, that all the good in the moral world proceeds, and is effected, through human means, or with human cognizance, and that the contrary is condemned, and re pressed; all that men do and approve considerately as the good, necessarily being under the corresponding impression, and is therefore adopted, esteemed, and approved. Not to undervalue such apparent humble authority for rights to rest on as the hu man judgment or opinion, this is the moral origin and authority of every thing good and valued by men. And what is the sum of moral authority ? Why it is the mind enquiring into, and sifting, and discerning what is practicable and best in this world, the sphere it has to act in, directed to the interests of the beings by whom it is possessed. In brief, what it is the province of man to do. But men do not think that their judgment is the sanction or authority for their rights. They cannot, at first, enquiring into the subject of the moral authority for their actions, bring their minds to consider that rights rest on or are granted by men by means of their approving judgment ; and that therefore, which they think they ought to have; and as far as opinion, esteem, or judgment can extend, that they give or grant by that judgment; that by that grant or gift of men's judgment, they really are given or rest. No ! they must seek for some more high authority, as supernatural means ; or even seek a solid matter to give them base, as if moral authority were solid materials, or any thing more than thought, idea, judgment, esteem, or opinion. So im portant do they consider their rights, they forget, or do not see, or bear in mind the ideality on which moral esteem flows and exists. Nor can they bring themselves to view that good which is in substance in things in being, and enjoyed, can be valued and sought for by man, and obtained, and sanctioned or granted ; and thus be justified; by man's approval and mental ideality, or moral existence of itself alone. Or why do men resort to authority,"], [126, "108 THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT otherwise than that which is mental or moral, as is exemplified by asserting rights to be founded in nature. The mistake is in confounding the ideality or the mind's con ception and approval, with the reality in substance, or with the thing esteemed and approved; and to which his judgment relates, or determines, or resolves; and which cause of mistake I shall endeavour to explain. How does it happen that men who are guided, (scientific and considerate men we mean,) by their judgment in almost every subject of science and research, obey their judgment as their au thority for what they see, and decide to be right or correct, in the subject of their enquiry, according as facts and circumstances relative to that subject, appear to them to warrant the conclusions they arrive at; and yet reject this authority, or do not see it in moral affairs. At the same time every act they do, or resolution arrived at, which engages their enquiry or investigation as to man, or in relation to him; it is appealed to, and determines his course of proceeding. How does it happen then, we ask, do men doubt the authority of the judgment in morals? Men, in con sidering the subject of rights, or in other terms, what they hold or consider they ought to have, from imperfect notions or in structions given, or from sentiment and preconceived opinion as to the good, are, perhaps, originally misled from the consider ation that their judgment decides in their esteem of the good. But whether this be the case or not, the judgment or approval of the good, and the good in reality, or the idea with the things, matters, or acts, that are the real good, being mixed and con founded together, we are apt to suppose the judgment of that approved, to be the same as the things or actual good. In considering rights, therefore, we are apt to suppose them one and the same with the actual good they refer to. It is evi dent, however, that the right is but the judgment in favour or to wards the thing it refers to. A man thus calls his life his right, and supposes them one and the same ; and that having life, his right follows of course, being one and the same thing. His right, however, to his life, is simply that which in the judgment ought to be, that is, as far as his life rests with or depends on men or"], [127, "AS THE SOURCE OF RIGHTS. 109 human power or influence, it should be ; and should not be pre judiced, or taken away, or be deprived of it. The effect of the error is this, that he does not discern the true nature or law of the moral authority ; and hence much ignorance, confusion, and mistake, and want of due appreciation of the subject of morals is the result ; and he does not set due esteem on the authority of his judgment. That the effect of the error, that he does not discern the true nature or law of the moral authority is a fact, will be seen in this, that his life being a matter of nature, a man in considering his rights, and asserting or assuming his right to live, he mixes the idea or judgment which is his right to life, with his life; and having life, he supposes, or draws the inference, that his right exists with it, or that his right is natural, and inherent, in him, as his life is, and that his right is one and the same with his life. Hence he concludes his rights are natural, exist in nature, and with his life nature gives him his right. One error or defect of this idea of his right being inherent is, that he is not dependent on, or under obligation to others \u2014 but, drawing as he does, his right from others, in the concurrent judgment of men, he is under obligation for such right ; and the duties are imposed, or result, due to others in the right, thus granted by the concurrence of men's judgment for rights to their lives, and by that means grant ing them. But it must be evident that the judgment, or other esteem of the mind, that constitutes rights, or determines, or judges, what ought to be in this respect, or that men' should be regarded or respected in their lives, is a distinct thing from life. It is the approval or consent to the thing, or being of , life. And is the effect or act of the mind in its knowledge, or perception of the being, matter, or thing, existence, or life ; of its, the mind's judgment, and opinion, in favour or towards it : but it, life, is distinct from, or another thing to, this moral decision in its favour. But men say, in considering rights, they are natural, and call them the rights of nature ; and life being natural, is esteemed or thought to be the rights of nature. I trust it will not be dis puted, the fact that men refer to their rights, as natural rights ; existing, and inherent, in the nature of the things themselves they claim as rights. Their life for instance being a gift of na-"], [128, "110 THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT ture, is a natural right of man, the gift of nature. If it is dis puted, the sentiment will be found in almost every writer on na ture, laws, and morals. Locke, Blackstone, Paley, and those they refer to, all speak of natural rights ; and they are in the mouth of every senator, lawyer, politician, and moralist, of the day, in the speaking of or referring to rights. Rights, however, are, as we have seen, but a creation of, or existence in the mind, in the judgment, esteem, or acquirement, morally or mentally, or in that power which constitutes the moral power of men ; in regard to that which ought to be, as concern ing men ; or what they ought to have. A mere idea of mind as to what should be as regarding men. Life exists in nature ; and rights in this respect in the idea, by the mind's perception of them, as what ought to be, in the esteem or judgment of men as respects it, life ; as rests with or depends on men, its preservation, or re gard, of it, and service or benefit rendered to it. It is evident that rights being a man's judgment in favour of or approving a thing, and that approved, as life is, are distinct matters, that the judgment, esteem, or favourable opinion of good as life is, is not the good itself, but the mind's perception of it, and favour or as sent to it ; which favourable judgment is the right ; and, therefore, the judgment, not the good, whatever that may be, gives the right to the good ; and the matter or thing, good, whatever it may be, himself, his house, his land, or justice, does not give man his right to them. If, supposing rights are natural, and rest upon nature, how shall we make out rights or apply them to things not natural, but yet essential to man, and his existence, and his well being. A house, raiment, or land, or any produce of art and industry. What can be the natural right to a house, or land, both requisite to man, and in some respects to his very existence? Apply the reasoning to modern improvements, or great works of art ; where can the natural right be in a steam-engine, a power loom, a ship, or any work or matter of art ? A man's right to his house, his land, or his labour, or industry bestowed on them, or whereby he lives ; we suppose is as good as to his life, and is as good or per fect in moral esteem, and moral existence. The right of a man to his house, we should say is morally as good in the estimation"], [129, "AS THE SOURCE OF RIGHTS. of men, as to his life, his person or being. The right of a man to the land he draws his food from, or he tills, or cultivates, plants, and raises grain or fruit from, are his, as much in right, as his life is, in human esteem ; but these are no part of his own nature. Ask the wild Indian what are his rights, will he not say my cabin, my game I have snared or killed, the grain or fruits I have grown or collected. Ask his notion of his rights, what they are, or whence derived, and he may confound them with his na ture as well as any moralist, or logician of his more civilized and learned fellow creatures. His rights, however, exist, he will claim and assert them. Rights are the same, and exist here with the savage, and with man, whether civilized, or uncivilized or exist ing in the free nature of his wilds. The existence of them, how ever, is his mind, or opinion, or esteem, or judgment, and the same moral law gives them to one, the same as another ; but the discrimination of the existence of the esteem, or the judgment, with the matters esteemed or approved, will be as much involved in the mind of the Indian, as in the mind of the more refined and lettered man, until his enquiry and consideration gives him a correct view or idea upon the subject. No sophistry will make out a natural right to a house, or land, because they are necessary for life ; and, as life being, or sup posed to be, the natural right of man, therefore that which may be necessary for this, is a natural right also. Such we are aware is the argument, but such is the mere trash of sophism, to say this is a natural right. No such authority is required, and we spare ourselves the justifying of our rights by such artifice of logic, to deduce it from nature. Property is necessary for man, or good for him, a house is that, and in the esteem, judgment, approbation, or consent, of men to such, or whatever may be considered as Property, is his right ; his moral right, as much as his life. It is not that things may be, or be necessary for, nature, and, therefore, his natural right ; but his judgment as a rational being seeing the necessity, or that it is good, beneficial, and useful, therefore he esteems it, judges it ouo-ht to be, and in his judgment is his right. The mind, the moral of the being moral, gives it to him. If nature gave rights where would the end, or definition of 111"], [130, "112 THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT nature's rights be ? They must be boundless as nature itself. But the moral power corrects the wildness and exuberance of nature, and gives a law to it, that is definable and controllable to limits and regulations, which, but for that, would destroy herself. But what can shew more clearly the mistake of men in con sidering the subject of their rights, and ascribing to them, their existence in nature, than the common notion entertained of liberty. Liberty as opposed to undue or unjust restraints of person, and action, and expression of opinion, in oppressive en thralments of power over the persons and actions of men, is a captivating theme of all men, seeking freedom from the tyrant's power, or oppressive laws, or governments. Liberty, as an in spiring motive with men, against all unjust restraints, real or imaginary with men, is considered the offspring of nature ; and the right of man, given by the bounteous hand of nature, in bring ing him into existence ; and is consequently considered the na tural right of man, born with him, inherent in his being, and all restraints of law, or order, however requisite, are nevertheless unjust, and infringements on his rights. Men evidently in such ideas, not distinguishing between the power of acting and think ing in any way they like, or fancy, and the judgment, opinion, or esteem of men as to the subject of the right, or what exercise, or enjoyment of action, they ought to have, and what extent, or latitude of opinion, or expression, ought to be allowed them ; or they might, or ought to, exercise. Or in other words, what restraints there should be on his actions, his sentiments, and expressions. But that which the judgment of men hold they ought to have the liberty in, or be free to do, in act or expres sion of his mind, his thoughts, or opinions is the only right a man in this respect has ; and which restricts the powers of ex pression and action to the respect of other men's rights ; and for which men are solely indebted to such judgment or opinion ; and they have no right, in the power they have or may have to act, and do, and besport opinions or expressions of their thoughts, as they like or fancy. If right in this respect consisted of men's power, then any extent that power enabled a man to go, act, think, and do, and express himself, might he do. This no man"], [131, "113 AS THE SOURCE OF RIGHTS. has ; or can he do without injustice to others ; and this no man can have a right or claim to do, and therefore right, in respect of liberty, cannot belong to his nature in such respect. But man has a right in this respect, for men judge or hold opinions that they ought to be free, or have liberty, to act, think, and enjoy themselves, under the restriction of respect and consideration of what is due to the rights others have, and to this judgment or opinion, consent or approbation, and esteem of men, are they in debted to their right to liberty. And to human judgment, there fore, but not to any inherency in themselves, or in nature, is to be attributed the rights of men, in what they are pleased to term liberty. Liberty is a fond and gratifying theme of men, because re straints are irksome ; and it is opposed to injustice, and thraldom of oppression and tyranny. It is always, therefore, a favourite with men, and liberty belonging to his power of action, or expression, the right appears to dwell in nature, while the power and latitude he ought to have which is his right, is existing in his judgment, or opinion, of that nature, in power of acting and thinking, and the extent and latitude men ought to have of acting, thinking, and expressing themselves. Liberty as a power of nature to act, and think, and do, as men can or may like, is on the grounds before stated, no right. The right which men may have in this respect, can only be what the judgment gives, which is the exercise of the power of nature to act, and think, limited or restricted, compatible with the respect or consideration of the rights of one another. It is wrong and an erroneous idea to say liberty is the natural right of man, convey ing by such term an idea that men may act as nature may give them power. A man has a right to liberty, and in this sense it is a restricted power, according to his rights, and his concomitant duties, to respect others. But liberty is a fond theme of men, with the patriot, and all who feel the pain and irksomeness of any restraint. It is a com mon and constant topic, because the occasion is almost ever pre sent ; and none more engages the attention, or is more fascinat ing. But liberty is but a part of man's rights in regard to life as to his power of action in mind, body, or speech ; one of the many i"], [132, "114 THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT accessories to the enjoyments, or matters, necessary to human happiness, and their well-being ; and a man in his rights to life has this included as one of the properties or qualities of his life in his person, his body, and mind, in his powers of action and expression. It is, perhaps, an essential matter, or thing, for his happiness, and for justice, but after all it is not a primary or a chief matter, that can subsist, or be considered alone, and forms but a component part of his good or of those things of which his good obviously consists : and certainly, possibly from opposition made to it, in the oppression and enthralment of tyrants, and op pressive laws, and governments, has been brought more into ob servation than otherwise, in reality is called for. It, however, as before observed, is almost ever present, obtruding itself as it were in every occasion, when we labour under any irksome restraint, and thus men are ever reminded of it. Men to have and enjoy their rights must have liberty, or due exercise and privilege or authority to act, and do, and express themselves, to an extent, and latitude, consistent with their good ; but with restraint, and limit, and control, to respect and consider others and their rights. So far have men their rights to act, think, and express themselves, and so far are they granted by the judgment of men with their rights to life, and what appertains wholesome, and good, for that. It is not our wish to detract from the blessing of liberty, but we wish to impress men with the proper estimation, and though giving it the due weight and importance belonging to it, aud its necessity, for the happiness of men, not to give it an imaginary, or fanciful, or deified estimation, which it does not possess ; and which can only delude, and render men irksome, and dissatisfied, as unfit for all restraint and control, requisite for the peace and order, and welfare of society ; or, in other words, the just and proper respect and consideration due from one man to another. But our object in mentioning liberty is to shew, that in the notions men entertain on it they esteem their rights in this re spect a natural right, and to shew how this error of considering the right belongs to his nature, in his power of action, and thought, and expression arises. But that in fact the right arises, or is given, by the judgment, and opinion, and esteem of men, of what"], [133, "AS THE SOURCE OF RIGHTS. 115 power or extent, or latitude, men should have of using and exer cising their powers of acting, thinking, and expressing themselves. And if his power of action was not judged favourably of, or es teemed by men as their rights, or what ought to be, his liberty would not exist ; but he might be made captive, or a slave, by any who had power, or art to compass or impose undue restraint, or control upon him. We repeat, then, that the judgment is the authority of men in whatever they do ; and that it is their sanction for what they do considerately and approve, is evident, and it is not possible in reason to deny it; for, whatever is approved by men is so esteemed in their judgment, and what could they do that is approved, that is not so esteemed by their judgment ; and it would be an evident absurdity to say men approved, or did what they approved ; but which was not so esteemed in their judgment. The judgment, therefore, is the decision or law of men for what they do that is approved, and it is the law there fore, that directs men in all they approve, for what it approves they do, or consider they ought to do, and should not act contrary to it, and it is his authority for acting accordingly, and sanctioning him in whatever it may be. The judgment, therefore, is the law of man, and rights are the term used for this judgment applied as regards himself, man, or morally, as concerning him in what it approves, as respects man, and to describe or convey a more de finite idea of them, and refer to that approved by men in what is good, that, being approved, and that it consists of as it does, of Life, Property, and Justice, such being obviously good. Rights mean and are no more than the approving judgment of men, as to men ; and it is in this law, they are raised or derived or depend, and nothing more ; and is that which is the sanction and authority to men for their rights. But in considering the subject of the law of men and rights, and shewing the case here stated, we examine into the fact ; and, in examining into and stating the fact of the law, which morally governs men, and the mode of its working or proceeding as regards men ; and which knowledge thus rendered scientifically, or according to facts, and truths, seen or admitted, as self evident, and past denial to all rational beings, will prevent the mistakes or errors, men are liable 1 2"], [134, "116 THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT to make in the subject of morals, and moral law and authority ; or in the moral nature of man, the same as they are liable to in any other subject ; and, mistaking in this, as we have shewn, that nature is the authority of rights, instead of his, man's, judgment. To what other authority are rights to be ascribed, or derived, or what other sanction can moral man have for them but his judg ment. They are not given by the laws of the land or the muni cipal laws, because laws are made expressly to protect, maintain, and assure them to men ; they being previously existing in men's knowledge and esteem. They exist, moreover, independent of all laws, because, how ever imperfectly or deficiently laws aid, secure, or promote them, the rights exist ; and men complain if they suffer wrongs, and the laws will not redress them ; or their rights are not well and pro perly respected, or protected by the laws ; they, rights, therefore, are existing as an object for the laws to maintain, and regard, evidently shewing they are not made, or originating by the laws ; which themselves exist but for rights, as the object for which they are instituted ; and this is the fact, for the laws are judged of their virtue, or not, by their accordance with, or better or more perfectly or well maintaining men's rights, or not. Rights, moreover, are imperishable, where a man has done no act to forfeit them, in the esteem which gives them ; and though men be deprived of that they concern, or apply to, or the subjects of them are denied to men, or we are abused in these things ; yet the rights exist, and on which that good they refer to, denied to men, is claimed and sustained. They exist, therefore, independent of the laws, and of every thing else but that law, or authority from whence they spring or emanate, of the human judgment ; and while men are rational, or moral beings, they always must exist in the law of man ; and entitle him to his good, and respect in regard to it. But men are liable to errors in their ideas, and conceptions of their rights, is evident; and, therefore, there is need in examining into the nature and authority of them, and to trace and shew them in the law of man, which gives them. Men, as we have before said, know their rights, and feel their right, or are sensible, to their own good, which they are desirous"], [135, "117 AS THE SOURCE OF RIGHTS. of obtaining ; and so far know their rights to that of which their good consists, their lives, their property, and their fair and equal consideration, in justice : and the reason and judgment of all men really does approve them, but they do not see how it applies to sanction them, as their first, and highest, and true authority. That men fall into errors on the subject, and know not, or are not able to shew whence they draw their rights, or they originate, men ascribe them to various authority. They assert them from their instituted laws. They infer them from nature. They look to their Gods and Idols among heathens and ignorant nations. But they never think of the law constituted in man for his direc tion, and give them to his judgment. Such is man in his igno rance of himself, without enquiry and investigation of his peculiar character, and nature ; and the necessity of enquiring into it to learn, what does direct him ; and what is that authority which he appeals to, and acts on, with comparative unconsciousness in every thing ; and is the noblest power and character of his nature, as his moral powers are and as his moral being is; but of which he is ignorant unless he enquires into his moral nature, the mode of its proceeding or the exercise of its powers, or he is instructed in it. We do not enter here on the particular actions or conduct of men, of what shall be good, or what shall be evil. We are con sidering purely and merely the law of the human judgment, as the primary law of man, from whence his actions or conduct in life termed moral, and every thing termed moral or properly human, proceeds ; and the rule it gives him for his direction, in rights, for those acts, or that practice of life, which is ap proved. To disabuse the mind of the impression that rights are natural, is as difficult as to satisfy the mind, that the sun does not move, to his outward senses, but that it is the earth that does. When a man begins to apply himself to the consideration of rights, or his claim or title to certain things, he considers as his own, as belonging to, part of, or inherent in himself, conceiving as they exist in nature, nature's law gives his right to them. He as na turally considers them the gift or rights in nature, and his right to be inherent in himself, as his life, his person, his limbs and"], [136, "118 THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT power of action. The bounty of nature required for his support, and obtained through his own act and deed, are also nature's rights, as much as his own being or person. They are needful, and they are acquired by his labour, art, and ingenuity, and he cannot at first separate his right from his nature, as distinct things, so connected as the idea of what is his good, and the good itself, as the idea and reality are ; and he does not consider the distinction in his own being or person, of his judgment and his existence being two things, and that the act of his judgment in the esteem of his own being, and what is needful for it, are dis tinct things to his own being or existence, and that it needs. But if he will consider one moment, a man must perceive his life is not his judgment in favour or esteem of that life, or his opinion that he ought to be, or live, as far as rests with him or men. He will see that life by itself, gives him no right or claim on others ; and without that claim, his life is in danger, or free to their acts to regard him or not, and to make him captive or to deprive him of life. And he will see that in his, man's, judgment or esteem, or opinion in favour of his life, and therefore that men should re gard or respect it, or him, and that he has a claim or title raised to be respected, and considered in such judgment, that it is his judgment through which he derives his right. And he will per ceive that the judgment is distinct from his life, but giving him claim, and title to it ; and without this judgment in what they see and approve, and agree, and consent, or admit to be their rights, there can be no esteem of rights, and no respect or consi deration of what are rights, and no claim or title in the esteem or opinion of men. It may be very possible, and very true, that men are not aware of, or do not see that they grant rights to one another, or have their rights granted to them, by their common judgment, or es teem, of what is good. Man acts and judges so spontaneously from self-love, or natural instinct, that he often proceeds without thinking, or considering what it is he esteems or refers to, in the acts or things he judges right or wrong. So innate or natural is it for men to act for their own good, or benefit, and judge every thing as it regards or concerns that good, that it does not occur to them, what is the motive of their action, or what that they judge"], [137, "AS THE SOURCE OF RIGHTS. 119 right or wrong relatively refers to, as agreeing with, or the re verse. And still less perhaps does it occur to men, or do they think of considering, the distinction of their judgment, or esteem, and the object of their favourable judgment, or of that which impels them to act or judge, and their judgment in favour of it or their esteem of it, which is in man himself or his good. And although men feel and know what they esteem or judge to be good, they do this so much from the impulse of nature, that the enquiry of what it is they do esteem, and the distinction, between their judgment and that their judgment favours, is overlooked or unheeded. That men proceed thus let us look at what it is they do esteem as good. Let us refer to Life, Property, and Justice, and these are so obviously agreeable and beneficial, they cannot suppose they require their judgment in theirfavour, or that it is necessary to sanc tion them in the adopting these things. But if they reflect, or will, refer to their judgment, a man cannot avoid seeing that he approves these things ; and approves them because agreeable and consistent with his being, he refers to himself in this approving judgment. Yet, it is very common for men to doubt or question the authority on which they proceed as regards themselves, or in what is moral ; and seem to think or look for the sanction of what is good, or what they do as regards men, as referring to some au thority separate from their own judgment, or what is founded on reasonable discrimination ; and for their authority in morals, ap ply to the laws of nature, and their rights supposed to exist there, without discovering their own judgment approves what is good, because consistent with man himself; that man is the subject matter of consideration, and his judgment the arbiter and au thority in acting in conformity with man himself. He accepts his judgment in other things where his interests, as in morals, are not concerned ; and why is it not as good au thority in morals, as in other things, or matters of mere art or science extraneous of his own being or self. It proves this, that men have not yet studied sufficiently their own peculiar nature in morals ; and to this time are ignorant of the law of morals, of the human judgment, and of the rules and modes of its proceeding in the plain fact of the object of man, be ing in his own self; and that it gives him his rights in such re-"], [138, "120 THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT spect, namely, to his good, and imposes his duties in conformity with his rights. And of nothing is he more ignorant than of himself, and of that most important of all things, of the power and authority which he has in his judgment, and does direct him. Always appealing to his mind for his direction, he rejects it in the most important of all things, that of being his authority as to himself, his own actions or morals. Self-love or self-esteem is innate, but judgment in favour of that object of esteem, or himself, man, or his moral esteem, is not that object of self-love, of himself in the good, the matter esteemed, but the esteem of it ; the mind's appreciation of it in its approving judgment, and is a separate effect or thing, namely, the mind's perception and approval, and is not innate but the mind's ac quired knowledge of himself as a being or existence, and his ap proving or favourable judgment of the subject his judgment is applied or directed to in consideration. Self-love, or the natural instinctive feeling or disposition every creature, man certainly not excepted, have, is innate, and moved by that, therefore men spon taneously refer by such cause in themselves to their judgment of things approved, or agreeable or consistent with their own selves, without perceiving the act of judgment in their minds considering and approving that which is so agreeable or consistent ; or in other words, they judge naturally by things being obviously in agreement or consistent with Use, and the benefits and comforts that existence is capable of, or of receiving, whether they are good, and therefore approved, or being contrary, are bad and not approved. But what is so esteemed either as the good in itself, as man's self, or as good in reference to that for which it is re quired, or consistent, and therefore esteemed, let them consider is something that has an existence ; and they must see that the ob ject he esteems, and for which he seeks and judges things, name ly, man himself, or life, is good, and food is good for his life ; but neither life, or food, are the esteem, or approval, or power to sanction his promoting one, or obtaining the other, or his right to them ; and that they are only, that esteemed, or approved, and in that esteem or approving judgment consist his rights. But his judgment does sanction him is most evident if he reflects, and approving as a rational being, authorizes and justifies him ; and"], [139, "AS THE SOURCE OF RIGHTS. 121 what he does with knowledge and his judgment approving is moral action in distinction to self-love, which is his natural action. Men seeing this, must see that the judgment in favour of, and es teem of, or approving, the good, and that good itself which is ap proved, are separate and distinct things. It is not till men consider that their spontaneous reference to some object or existence esteemed, as themselves in self-love, is the subject upon which their judgment is exercised, that they see that their own being of men themselves, is referred to, by which they judge or esteem what is good. It is thus by the innate self love existing in all men, and their natural action in conformity to it, or its dictates, that they pursue and adopt what is good, or what they see or suppose agrees with them, and is therefore right in relation with the object that moves them, that men na turally and commonly act, and proceed and promote their wel fare ; and thus the natural motive and action accords or corre sponds with the moral motive and action of the approving judg ment, and appears the same, and what virtue is, is learnt in the experience of their lives. The motive of men's actions being innate, namely, their good and self-love, they are not immediately, or without enquiry or consideration, aware of that motive. Yet they use their judg ment and their reason in seeing and discriminating, and deciding on that which accords with that which spontaneously moves them, or the innate principle of self-love; and they use their judg ment and their reason before they discover the distinction between that and the object which moves it. As in the instance of self-preservation, men act on the moment with out enquiring the motive, or adverting to the cause which prompts them to avoid danger, whoever thinks when he flies an imminent danger; or who, in dire hunger thinks, in appropriating food he finds ready for his use. Nor till men consider there is some ground or motive in themselves for their acting, and deciding what they shall do, do they see the existence of that motive in their own being, or the judgment acting upon that motive. This common motive with all men, and this common and spon taneous applying of their judgment, and reason, in obedience to it, make all men concur; and without perceiving it, give to one"], [140, "122 THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT another their rights in their concurrent judgment and approval of what is good ; spontaneously proceeding from them in that innate self-love which moves all men. But it is that judgment or ap proval, or consent, or opinion of men of that which is good, and which ought to be, that gives men their rights ; and not the in nate disposition to pursue and obtain their good or benefit; al thouo-h their natural inclination towards their good or benefit, may make it appear that a man's rights to his good, come from such innate motive or nature, that disposes him towards his o-ood; for it is the mind, or moral power of man, that recognizes, sees, or discerns what is good ; esteems and approves it as a ra tional being. But self-love can give men no rights, and no claim upon other men for their consent or agreement to what is good, or respect or consideration for them ; which can only be recog nized or known to men through the mind's agency, in its dis cernment and recognition, and judgment in favour of that which is good. I am afraid the reader will think me tedious in what I have said on the innate motive which prompts or inclines men to their good, and their judgment which approves it; but I have thought it necessary to press on the mind the distinction, that they may see the law or authority of the judgment, and why men may not have adverted to it, so much, as it is hoped they may henceforward do: which by the judgment being called into action by the spon taneous motive of self-love, and directed to the same object, the moral ground or authority for his conduct in his judgment is mixed up and hidden in the natural motive urging the judgment. Hence is the moral sanction attributed to nature, in the natural law of nature's feelings, and supposed nature's rights. The er rors of which, and the misdirection it is calculated to give, I trust has been sufficiently exhibited in the licence it inclines and jus tifies men in; gratifying past doubt, to their passions and feelings, while illusory and destructive in principle ; and at the same time, the opposite or good effect of the authority of the judgment shewn in granting rights; and in these, limiting and restricting men to their duties, in a wholesome and practicable course of con duct, by which the object of the good of men as related, or in volved, in the action and conduct of one another, is to be effected."], [141, "AS THE SOURCE OF RIGHTS. 123 It is by the enquiry into the ground or authority for rights, that we come to analyze the ideas and make the distinction between the judgment and that judged, that we see they are distinct things, and arrive at the true nature and authority of the judg ment and the origin of rights; and discover that they owe their existence to the human judgment, and not to a supposed innate being or existence in the nature of things themselves. And it is, we hope, made sufficiently plain and intelligible, how men derive their rights from the moral powers or agency of man in his mind ; and the importance of a knowledge of this fact from the sanction it gives, both to his claims and his duties. But so connected or blended as the judgment or approval of men, is with that judged or approved, or that he is disposed towards in his inclination from self-love, men are not commonly aware of this distinction ; nor does it appear without consideration, the judgment and in clination as to himself, or in moral concerns, seeming to spring at the same time, and from the same source, that they are separate and distinct things. But it is not the case as to other things, not morals, but of pure science or philosophy that a man knows not of the difference or mistakes his judgment and the subject of his consideration. For where a man applies himself to learn the nature or properties of other things or subjects, or any thing that may concern them, there he is aware of his judgment as to those subjects, and as a distinct matter from them. And there we see his judgment acting as his authority in his direction in what he sees or discerns re lative to them, and his authority and sanction for what he con siders or discovers as the truth regarding them. So where he makes any discovery and improvement, he adopts it ; his mind is his authority for this. If he finds a better mode of rearing or treatment of cattle, he adopts it; or of cultivating corn, or hus bandry, or improvement in machinery, he adopts it. What makes him to do so, is his mind or judgment that is his au thority ; or in natural philosophy, if he discovers an error in his ideas as to things, he corrects it in his mind, and that is his au thority. And where his own good, or morals, are not imme diately concerned, if a man is desirous of a better mode of in struction, or discovers a truth respecting himself he was not before"], [142, "124 THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT aware of, he adopts it; his judgment is his authority: and surely if rights depend upon that judgment approving the good, that is his authority for them, as other things. But he feels not the au thority of his judgment so readily in his own obvious and imme diate good, as he does in other cases, owing to the concordance with his disposition and inclination dictated by self-love, and the spontaneous acting of his judgment for the object of self-love in his own good, for to no other cause can we assign his admitting his mind, or his judgment, is his authority, in nature, or art, or science, or philosophy in general, and not in morals. But for farther illustration, let men reflect that in matters of science regarding man physically, as the study of disease, and me dicine, and surgery, the circulation of the blood, and other pro perties of his nature. Here having an object of science of the nature of the constitution of the being independent of self-love, his mind and judgment in this is seen distinct from that it is ap plied to, or judges concerning it; and the discoveries in the con stitution or conformation of his nature, its various powers and properties, its affections from disease, and the means of cure, or alleviation of his sufferings, he considers right according to his discernment and judgment, and adopts what he discovers on the sanction of his judgment. If then his judgment is the au thority for what appears a truth in science, and that science respecting himself, but of physics, not of morals, is it not the same discernment and judgment that decides in his enquiries into morals, or the subject of his actions and conduct in relation to man, and what are his rights, whence they are derived, and if he finds his judgment approving the good, gives him his rights, is not that as good or true authority that he does derive them from his judgment, or that his judgment gives them, as for any truth or fact he discovers in himself physically. The judgment is the authority for any matter of fact or truth man considers as such in the enquiry into and investigation of any subject; and it is evident therefore, it must be the same authority or sanction to him in morals as in other subjects. The only dif ference is, rights being themselves given or derived from the judgment, the judgment decides what it gives, and in the other cases decides what it discovers to exist independent of itself."], [143, "125 AS THE SOURCE OF RIGHTS. But it nevertheless must be very apparent that his judgment is as good authority for the truth of its own act, that man does grant his rights by his judgment, and that they are thence derived, and from no other source, as for any other matter of fact or truth that he is satisfied of in other things, from the decision of his judgment. What, then, men learn by a consideration of their moral rights is, that they rest and depend on men through the powers of dis cernment and judgment, and in this a fact or truth in morals as to their authority, or the foundation on which they rest, on that most important to men, namely, their rights. The result of any truth established, it is impossible to foresee, as to the advantages, and they may be of the greatest consequence in human conduct, their affairs, and proceedings ; and in what is not of least importance to man is, that in taking their rights resting or depending on men, that their duties are raised and imposed on them by the same authority : and that if they assert or pretend to rights, or any good or benefit at the hands, or respect, or consideration of men for their rights, they are but so entitled to them, subject to the duties and obligations consequent and coexistent with them, due to others, which are those of respect and consideration of others in their rights. In his reflection, that no man has any right but what he takes in his judgment approving the good, and also at the hands, or with the concurrent judgment of all men on this head, he will see *he debt and obligation to others, not only for respect, but for a consideration of them in whatever his power is, to render them service, as homage for the gift taken at their hands of his- own good in his rights. Pride and assumption of the innate nature of all things, and certainly not less in man than in brute creatures revelling in health, and strength, and abundance, when he is in the full enjoyment of riches, and power, will be lowered, and cor rected, in consideration in what, and on whom depends his rights, which gives him claim and title to his good, his wealth, and his comforts, to whom his duties in return are co-existent, and with out such dependence on other men, his own pretensions to any, the least enjoyment, the very earnings of his labour, the ne cessaries of life, and the humblest trifle he can call his own, are"], [144, "126 THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT of no account, for they are not his without his judgment ap proving the good, and the concurrent judgment of men of their rights. I consider that I have abundantly shewn that rights are granted by the judgment, and that in his judgment rest the au thority of man to his rights, and that his not seeing his authority rests with himself in his judgment, is from the circumstance that his judgment, esteem, or opinion, correspond with the motive of self-love, which prompts him in his good, and he sees not, or makes not, the distinction between his judgment and that ap proved as good, in the according of his judgment, and spontaneous action of that, with self-love, for the same object, that of good. But this being pointed out to him as a reasonable being, he cannot longer doubt but that his judgment is distinct from the good it sees, and is inclined to, from self-love, and approves in his judgment; and which, his judgment approving constitute his rights. But at all events, it is made most evident in the statements here given, that rights, moral rights, are granted by the judgment, and on that is founded all claim and title of men to their rights, and the good of man ; and whether or not we have made it clear to men why they have not more generally, or readily perceived, that it is by their judgment corresponding with the dictates of self-love, that they do not distinguish that it is by their judg ment their rights are granted, is, therefore, of little comparative consequence, and more a matter of satisfaction, to convince them of the cause of their errors, and to dispose them more readily admit of correction, than of necessity for their farther information and direction in morals ; a proper knowledge whence their rights are derived, being made evident to common sense, and as far as his reason and judgment can decide, that rights are granted by the judgment. To many men, possibly there was no occasion to enter into the long discussion of the error of men in supposing rights were derived from nature ; or of the cause of that error ; for many may consider the true authority of their actions and justification to rest upon their judgment ; and all practically do refer to that authority, or do so where they refer to their reason for their"], [145, "AS THE SOURCE OF RIGHTS. 127 direction. Except there may be cases in which men are governed by prejudices, and erroneous preconceptions, on moral matters. And no doubt, many who may not before have considered the subject, will be satisfied with the statement given, that it is the judgment which give men their rights. But it is a truth required to be known for the direction of all men ; and it is to be made, therefore, clear and perspicuous to the comprehension of the un thinking, the heedless, and those who do not consider ; and the dull, and those not of quick apprehension ; the knowledge of the law of morals being required, for the better direction of all men. Having, then, established the authority for his rights, my next business is, to exhibit the duties of men, and their authority, or how they arise. Men are alike acquainted with their duties as with their rights ; for men cannot see that they have rights, with out seeing that they have duties. For if men have rights, then must men have duties to respect those rights, or they must see, on reflection, that their conduct should be such as corresponds or agrees with the rights, or they could be of no avail. As if men have right to their lives, then is it necessary that men should have respect for the lives of men, and in which respect lay their duties. And the like reasoning applies to Property, and to justice ; and if men have rights to these, they must see they have duties to respect these ; and all men know it is wrong to take away life \u2014 to rob \u2014 or deny justice. In the estimation and judgment of men, therefore, all men know their duties in this respect. We say, therefore, men have their duties, and they know them, the same as they know their rights. And the same question occurs as to duties, as to rights, how or whence do men derive their authority for them. And the answer to this is, the same authority as raises or gives, or from which men derive, their rights, raise or impose duties, or they are derived from the same source, namely, the judgment of men. In raising or granting rights, men, at the same time, raise or impose their duties in respect of those rights ; for men, in ap proving their good, approve that respect or consideration of it which is necessary for it, and consider such ought to be the same as, or in correspondence with their rights, which is necessary for the maintenance, preservation, or promotion of their good, and in"], [146, "128 THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT this, of their Life, Property, and Justice ; and to refrain from, or avoid the contrary, or that which will injure or prejudice these ; and which respect or consideration of their good, or that of which it consists, are their duties. Duties, or the obligations of men to regard and have consider ation of one another in their rights, are necessarily coincident, and co-existent, and commensurate, with their rights; and as men approve of their good, and by their approval raise and grant their rights to it, they, at the same time, by the same authority of their judgment, raise and impose the regard and' consideration of one another in respect of those rights ; and this is evident, because if men had not at the same time their rights were de rived, duties, in respect of them, or were not held bound to respect their rights raised, and such were not existing together with them, and in equal extent or degree to respect their rights granted, we could not say men have rights. Because, then, others would not have any duty or obligation to them or would it be considered they ought to respect or regard them, and they might defeat, prejudice, and destroy that which their rights concerned, without any offence or contradiction to the human estimation, or judgment, in that which it approved, and approving granted. But the con trary to this latter position is the fact, and men in granting rights by their judgment or esteem, hold men have obligation for the necessary respect and consideration for the rights granted. It would be ridiculous to say that, man had a right to live, as far as that may rest with man, in the acts or deeds of man, but that it was not the duty of man, or man ought not, or had no occasion to respect life, but take it away, or that men might destroy one another. It is evident that rights, as regard men, and rests with, or depends on men, by their respect or consideration of such rights, and not to injure them, such respect or consideration is imposed in the raising or granting such rights, in which respect or consideration consist the duties of men ; and the duties of men, therefore, in giving rights, are imposed on men at the same time, are existing with them, and in equal degree to the necessity of their existence, and are coincident, co-existent, and commensurate with rights. Duties arise with, and follow rights so necessarily, that like"], [147, "AS THE SOURCE OF RIGHTS. 129 rights, men see not the authority of their judgment in imposing them, any more than they see their authority in their judgment for their rights. They both stand in this respect alike, and we need not observe more upon the want of the authority of the judgment being seen by men as their moral law. I consider that I have now sufficiently explained that the du ties of men arise with their rights, and are coexistent with them, and of their origin and authority of them with their rights in the human judgment. I shall therefore next proceed to shew and illustrate through the consideration of duties, the very obvious necessity of rights proceeding from the human judgment in con sidering the duties of men, as to their origin or authority. I ask then if rights are not derived from and exist not in the judgment of men, how can we raise or derive the duties of man ? If men in their judgment of that which ought to be, considering that which is obviously the good of men, and essential in this re- spect, and consenting and agreeing by the universal concurrence of men in these things which are so, and granting, therefore, rights to men in these things, did not at the same time raise the duties of men, in the respect and consideration of one another, in what they grant as rights ; in what way I may ask, are the du- ties of men raised on men ? We cannot conceive, and defy any reasonable being to conceive, that any man can claim respect or consideration of another without such is raised, and rendered due by the judgment, the esteem and approbation of men. But if re spect and consideration is due from men to one another in their judgment and esteem and opinion, then are the duties of men raised and created and imposed by that judgment of men. Whe ther it is so, the fact must speak ; and men, as has been shown, do by their judgment grant their rights, and in these impose the respect and consideration of one another necessary for such rights, and in that respect and consideration is the duty of men. Such duty, therefore, is raised by men in their judgment, it is raised or imposed by the moral powers of men in their mind, of reason and their judgment, and is founded in and emanating from such moral powers. But what duties could be raised in men if rights were natural. Suppose rights were natural, who ever heard of, or could imagine K"], [148, "130 THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT natural duties ? Who ever heard of the natural duty to respect or esteem property, as a house, or land, or cattle, trees, or corn, or stone ; or the natural duty to join and concur in setting up and maintaining government, or laws? What is there in these things even like the human person, or human nature, as to mere animal existence if that gave a right, to make the esteem or re spect of such things before mentioned a matter of nature (sup posing it to be, which it is not, a natural duty to regard or re spect men as to their lives or persons). But yet men have duties to each other in respect of these things, as well as towards men themselves. If men grant rights to property, or to protection and justice, men impose duties to respect that property, and to the means or institutions, of affording protection and justice. And men raise their duties by their judgment, as much as they do their rights, and their duties are the corresponding respect of men to one another in their rights, necessary for the rights given. The fact is, as before stated, men have imagined the objects of good being natural, their rights to be natural ; but nothing can show the absurdity of the error more completely, than applying their idea of natural rights to duties, for there can be no rights without duties to respect them ; but who ever heard of, or could conceive natural duties to houses, land, cattle, fish, fowls, trees, or stone, yet there are duties in respect of these, when they are property, or of good to men \u2014 but such are moral rights, and the duties consequent of them are moral duties, and founded in the human judgment of what men ought to do. Natural love, natural affection, natural kindness, and good nature, disposition, or will, are common and conversant matters with all, but these are not duties. They are grounds or matter to guide and direct us for our judgment to decide by, and control us in what is right and consistent with our feelings, and affections, where wholesome and beneficial ; and to justify and supply ob ligations where affection fail us ; but the natural passions or in clinations are not duties : and it is the mind that supplies the duty, according with natural affections, as relatively good and effective for the human good. The duty is that we ought to do, seeing what is right or proper in relation to that we are called on"], [149, "131 AS THE SOURCE OF RIGHTS. to do in respect and consideration of the rights raised, and granted to others by our judgment ; and such are duties. Affec tions and good-will, may lead the same way, but whether or not our desire or inclination is concurrent, what is duty or moral ob ligation that is what we are required to do, whether we like it or dislike it, or be well disposed or not. Rights raised, are a boon given, and impose an obligation, and whether we choose to obey it or not, it is the moral rule derived from the judgment, and duties are imposed by the same autho rity ; and we must submit to the tribunal of human opinion of approbation, or the contrary, and the evils attendant on the of fences to the judgment of men, as its weight according to the of fence, is heavy or light. Our attention is not called to venial matters, these need never vex us, but premeditate and wilful offence we must pay the pe nalty of, in the disapprobation of men as it is visited heavy or light according to our offence. The approbation, good esteem, and opinion of men, is the moral means of rewarding the moral duties, and their displeasure and rejection, the punishment of of fence to them. These are not to be trifled with, the man who de serves and has the good opinion of men, will have the regard and protection, good will and kindness of men, be respected and ho noured ; and him who has not will be slighted, shunned, and de serted, and in all deeds of crime and violence, all suspicion and odium will rest, where the real culprit cannot be found. It cannot be two strongly impressed, or borne in mind, that men cannot disrespect or offend against moral right without doing a wrong or injustice to others, whose rights will be thereby in vaded, and prejudiced ; and in a proper esteem of virtue and ab horrence of crime and vice, depends the moral governance of men, and the good and happiness of men, and evil and the misery and wretchedness of men, will be dependent on the estimation in this respect of one another. With respect to duties, although men all see and know and acknowledge their duties, they will not always observe them, any more than they will adhere to or observe what they grant as right. In truth, the very departure from the one is the infraction of the other, for it is the not respecting of rights, or men not k2"], [150, "132 THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT having that consideration of one another which they ought to have, that the breach of duty consists. But where the knowledge men have of their duties, with the moral influence or force of the good repute, and esteem men bestow for their performance, and of their deprecation at their breach, or omission, is not enough to keep men just in their performance and regard of them, here it is that resort must be had to the compulsory means of the law, in those cases deemed of sufficient importance for its interference. If men will calmly and dispassionately reflect, and discharge from their minds all prejudice ; than that which is an approval of their own rational judgment, and in that which is beneficial for them and desirable to their corporeal nature, and inclination, they can have no stronger moral force or influence over them towards that they see and acknowledge ought to be, and will, and pledge themselves to perform, or observe, or agree to, as depends on themselves, which they do in their approval of the good. Such is the rule for human direction ; but it is unhappily a truth, that men do not, and will not, always adhere to or observe what they grant, or admit to be the rule of their action or duty towards others. But the breach of a law or compact does not impugn, or annul the covenant, or deny the agreement or the knowledge of it. They have entered into the moral law, and needs must in their approval or knowledge of what is good ; and every man in taking his own rights, or approving the good, seal as it were their contract to the grant of the rights of others ; and this is the compact of society. The common sense or understanding of men explain the term of the compact, and what is the obvious good of men in Life, Property, and Justice, are the plain and evident sub jects of it ; and respect and consideration of one another in these things, the duties they are bound to perform. It is here, indeed, that compulsory means are called for, and where requisite to enforce the performance of the pledge, all men make to one another in the common and general knowledge they all have in what they approve, and esteem as good ; and their own interests always will move men in the desire, and endeavour to enforce, by seeing and feeling the failings of others ; and by that motive, therefore, calling for the observance of duties in others towards themselves : and laws and governments are institutions"], [151, "133 AS THE SOURCE OF RIGHTS. for the better maintaining, and carrying into effect, the object with all men of good, and respect of their rights as the obvious means whereby it is to be effected. On the institution of government and laws for effecting or en forcing the moral law, it is to be observed that the moral rule raised and existing in the estimation of men in what is good, and the grant of rights, as what that rule more particularly consists, is the prime rule of human direction, in whatever men do resting with man. It is pre-existing and independent of all other human institutes of law, as civil or municipal law, and ordinances and edicts of governments, although it may be, and necessarily is, subservient to government, and the jurisprudence of the state, with respect to the command over, and obedience of the subjects. Government and the municipal law nevertheless confirm the moral law of the human judgment in what that raises as the prime rule of human direction in the moral rights of man, and neces sarily must do so, as the base and the purpose for which such are raised and instituted. The purport and object of all law and go vernment being the support and maintenance and protection of human interests, and in this the moral rights of men. Although, as has on a former occasion been noticed, laws may, through error, or want of foresight in men, or want of right judgment in human affairs, and the complexity of such matters, not be efficient, de feat its object, or even be opposed to the purpose for which it is instituted in the moral good. The moral law itself, in what it specially relates as human rights, may be the subject of specific enactment, or declaration ; and is necessarily always implied, as the purport or base, on which all government and law are founded, which, for greater certainty, and to put it beyond all doubt or question, special or dinances and laws shall frequently repeat, what the moral law, in rights, prescribe. Such is more in aid and corroboration of the moral law, than to mark its deficiency or its want of direction to man. As such we shall find the crimes of murder prohibited, of theft, of robbery, of bearing false witness, or perjury, also pro hibited. But there is no deficiency in the moral law in this re spect, for the rights of men and the respect and consideration due to these fully proclaim all these as crimes, and all other acts ob-"], [152, "134 THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT viously injurious to man, and the moral good, to be interdicted of men : and although the moral law be declared in the edicts of civil institutes, yet the moral law exists in itself in the human judgment as well as the moral rule it prescribes of rights, inde pendent of such authority or command of municipal law or legis lative law. All which is evident by the existence of men's know ledge and judgment of what the good is, or is meant by that term, and of their rights in such respect. A man's right to his Life, his Property, of whatever it may con sist, and to Justice, all men know, and claim, as that which they ought to have whether it be sanctioned by law, or not ; and his right in these respects, is as good in his esteem, as if confirmed by, or they were specially mentioned as a law or ordinance, or decree, of the state or legislature. And all men know this, for, ask the wild unlettered savage what his rights are, and he will say his life, his cabin, his spear, his game taken, or killed ; and that he should have justice, or should not be wronged in these, or have them taken from him, or injured, which shews, that the moral law exists, and is a rule to govern and direct him, independent of all other laws, or municipal or legislative laws ; for whether such exist or not, men know the good and their right to it, and that they should not, or cannot be prejudiced in respect of it with out enduring a wrong. And no better evidence of this can be adduced, than they are the implied rule of men's direction, and that by which all men judge, whether they have acted rightly, or wrongly, as they observe them, or depart from or neglect them ; and if governments and laws were inefficient, or did not decree, or ordain, that which was moral or good, yet would men know the rule of their direction in what was good, and their rights in such respect, and would approve the regard of it, and condemn the neglect of or offence to it; for, if government neglected or omitted to ordain that men should not kill or slay one another, or rob, or thieve, or falsely accuse, or bear false testimony against one another ; men would yet know these things were wrong, and that their Life, their Property, and Justice were their rights ; and that they ought to be considered, and respected in them, notwith standing all neglect or omission of government or inefficiency of the laws. Evidently shewing what the moral law is in effect, or"], [153, "AS THE SOURCE OF RIGHTS. 135 practically applies to, that men know it, and it is that by which they are all primarily directed. Before concluding these observations, on the authority and source of rights being founded in men's judgment, 1 think it proper to notice that the idea of rights has, perhaps, the greatest effect, or are the greatest power morally operating with men as applied to their justification, to influence them in asserting, main taining, and preserving, because approved by their reason, and agreeable to their inclinations or their feelings, that, which may concern their welfare, or what is their good. Knowledge of, or the idea of, rights, as that belonging to men and which ought to be, exist with all men in their knowledge or estimation of the moral good or their benefit, and which as rest ing with men ought to be. And this practical knowledge of their rights all men unavoidably, and of necessity, must possess, if they have the merest glimpse of reason or understanding. \u2014 Rights are an estimation of men of what men ought to have, and they ought not to be deprived of or prejudiced in, as depends on, or rests with men. \u2014 And in the idea of rights, all men found their claim to justify them in what they consider or hold belongs to them, or is their own, and they should not be prejudiced in, or deprived of; or if they are, consider that they suffer wrong or injustice, and ought to have redress. These are plain positions, apparent to the most mean understanding, and they shew that all men have a know ledge of their rights, or what they practically mean by them. The appealing to men, therefore, by their rights, has been found to be of the most potent nature to rouse or excite them in that cause, their rights apply to, or are supposed to do. And I say supposed, because rights are frequently applied erroneously, or to topics not the subject of them or improperly and with sinister views of parties appealing to them. It may happen that men may not be alive to, or duly consider or appreciate their rights, although all men must act upon them, as is seen where men claim any moral respect, or consider regard is due to them, from their fellow creatures. The wild and unlet tered savage acts upon them. It is true some men may entertain a high and refined sense of them, while others may be so unaware of a proper consideration of them, that they may not make any"], [154, "136 THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT claim or pretension to them, but be supine to all indignity and oppression. It is the bringing of them under the consideration of men, or rather calling men's attention to them, that makes them operate, or give the high force of their power over men. Moral philosophy has done this, and moral philosophers have called men's attention to their rights ; and those men who have appealed to them, and called men's attention to their application to the pro motion of these matters of common and obvious interest to men, have therefore had a most powerful means of influence over men; and have raised the strong feeling among men existing in the present day, on the subjects of interest, considered specially as their rights, for it cannot be denied that it is by rights men morally claim any, and whatever good they possess or seek to obtain. The consideration of rights is important, as shewing the nature of their foundation, and the authority of them, and the rules upon which they proceed ; or that govern men, or is their means of di rection in the subject of rights ; and while, true it is, or may be, as before observed, that all men are acquainted with them, admit them, and are influenced by them, and even reason on them, they may not be able to explain the origin ; or refer to their opinion and see the power and force of that authority, when ap plied to their rights ; nor be in the habit of considering the na ture of rights, and see the law which govern or direct them in such respect ; although necessarily, by the force of reason, acting under that authority, in discerning what is conformable to, or consisent with, their good to which their rights apply. The consequence of their want of knowledge or explanation is, that men are led wildly and enthusiastically away with the idea and justification of rights, without considering the law which gives them limits, or imposes control on them ; and, moreover, under want of correct knowledge, very erroneous ideas may be enter tained with respect to them, which a knowledge of their authority would correct with the same force and sanction as it gave them their rights. And while a proper knowledge repressed the extra vagancies and effects of the errors of men on some occasions, it would give yet a stronger impulse over men in what was their rights, by shewing them the good or benefit resulting, was sane-"], [155, "137 AS THE SOURCE OF RIGHTS. tioned and confirmed to them in the truth or correctness of the authority they have, for asserting and maintaining them. It is, we apprehend, the errors in respect of rights ; or the in correct application of rights, in supposing they exist where they do not, and the ignorance in supposing them to be without limit or qualification, tha,t the danger is in the appeal to them. The resort to them, practically, more or less, is of a necessity a mea sure of all mankind, as all moral claims of men, and the justifica tion of the good, are in reality, and practically founded on them ; for what is good, but the respect of men in what is their rights. And it would be idle to talk of not referring to them, or not to call on men to attend to them and regard them ; you might as well endeavour to tell men not to care for or regard themselves ; but the correct or incorrect use that is made of information, and the application of rights, is what we have to admonish on, and put men on their guard with respect to rights. It is to this end that no better rational means can offer, than enquiring into them to learn their true nature in their authority, and what that gives or sanctions in rights, as the rules men have to guide them. It would be absurd, therefore, to interdict the consideration of rights, or to complain of calling men's attention to them ; but when men call upon one another by their rights, or call them up in men's minds, they should not omit, at the same time, to remind them of their duties, which flow from, and are consequent of their rights ; and which limit the rights of each by the respect and consideration due to those of others ; and under which re striction or control the power or privilege, or benefits bestowed upon men by them, must be understood. As, likewise, of their subjection to circumstances, and especially to that of the power or authority of government or law, without which society could not exist. And although moral rights are the rule raised by the moral law of the judgment of men, for the moral direction, and are the prime rule of such, their first law, yet they are not first in authority over civil institutions in respect of command over men, or obedience ; and in this respect, are subject to civil laws, which, nevertheless, are founded or based on rights. Though civil laws occasionally, or mistakenly, may be opposed to rights, and while laws, are of necessity, to be obeyed as the"], [156, "138 THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT first in authority to command, or be obeyed ; yet founded on rights ; which is evident, by their being judged as to their correctness or goodness or sufficiency, or the contrary, by their conformity and efficiency as to moral rights; the law of all civil institutions, inevery instance where rights may not be opposed to the existing and posi tive ordinances through necessity or error, imply the moral rights, as the general law, as agreeable to its objects, and commands ; and will expect them to be observed, and will preserve and main tain them, and enforce observance, where their interference may be considered requisite. In bringing, therefore, before men, the subject of their highest interest, as their rights past question are, and establishing on an indubitable authority, as we shew the human judgment to be, and that authority all men are capable of seeing, and shall be satis fied, they take their title the one the same as the other, and one not before or after, or more or less than another, to their good ; I consider it is a matter of no little advantage, and consolatory re flection, that by the same means his good is established as his right, by the plainest facts and reasoning, that his duties are raised and established ; and that this is made evident to the meanest capacity ; for as he takes his rights so does he take, or is he made the subject of his duties in respect of those rights ; and that same judgment which is the authority of men's rights, is also the authority to bind and require men to regard and observe their duties. Apprehensive of the influence of rights, and aware of the ef fect of new views and doctrines with regard to moral authority, we fear we have done much wrong to our former labours in treat ing of that which concerns morals from the beginning. But fearful of elating men too much in setting forth their claims on the principle of the human welfare, when duly considered as rights, are this, and the law and authority of man of his judg ment sanctions and justifies this, has rendered our style on former occasions insipid. Time alone could enable us to reach the pre sent development; and for any distaste excited in our former works, although it may be supposed it is a subject for some apo logy, I consider it is a matter more of regret to ourselves than of the claim of others on us in a matter that is gratuitous on our"], [157, "AS THE SOURCE OF RIGHTS. 139 part. But any failing of fixing men's attention to the subject, I hope has amends made for it in the present volume. Under the consideration of the subject of rights, it will be proper to make some observation on the equality of rights, to point out that equality of rights are not the same as, or do not mean equality of good; and it is the more necessary to do this, in order to correct an error men are very apt to fall into of considering that equality of rights means equality in every thing as to man, and of good especially. The error men fall into causes inexplicable difficulty and confusion in considering rights, and the subject of government and legislation, and every matter connected with polity and human concerns, and conse quent inability to form correct notions of rights, and satisfy them selves upon these subjects. I propose, therefore, to enquire into the subject of equality of rights, to shew what it means or applies to, and that it does not mean equality of good, and that it is not the same thing. With respect to equality of rights as a measure of considera tion, or justice, as applicable to the consideration of the subject of rights in Property ; it may be proper here to introduce the sub ject of equality of rights, and to shew that it does not mean equality of good ; unless under equality of circumstances ; and which, in the ordinary consideration of rights, we are not consider ing now, but shall advert to hereafter, before concluding this notice. The rights of men are equal, as we have seen, for we can make no distinction of claim one man has more than another to rights, and so is their claim and title to respect and consideration of their good ; and the duties therefore of men, which is this respect and consideration of one another, is to regard and respect men equally in their rights to their good. But though it is the duty of men to respect the rights of others to their good, it cannot be supposed, or is it practicable, that men should equalize their rights in what is their good, with the rights of others in what is their good. Or in other terms, that one possessed in their rights to greater good than another, that he should reduce or lower his larger quantity, or greater good to that of another, or by adding what he reduces of his own to that of another to make both equal. Or that he whose rights extended to a small"], [158, "140 THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT share of good, should deprive the possessor of greater good of his enjoyments and blessings of life, or take or help himself to the larger possessions of property of another. These things it must be obvious are impracticable with the good of men ; and under the idea, that equal rights give equal good or possessions to all, that would extend to the equal distribution of every thing : so that all should be equal, and no one possess more good, or greater benefits in life than another, otherwise there would be an ine quality, and in this sense of equal rights giving equal possessions, any inequality would be an injustice. This state of things it is evident is utterly impracticable. Although what one man more talented, more industrious and virtuous, more prosperous or fortunate than another in his posses sions, so far precludes another from having the same good as such enjoy, and the want of what others possess, may be to his prejudice. Men never can be held accountable for their rights extending to greater good, in their greater blessings in life, of person, of health, power of body or mind, talent, industry, better discrimination, their success and prosperity, their greater acquirements or possessions. \u2014 Were it so, the reward of merit and virtue would not exist, but the paralyzing of human exertions and industry, the prevention of human benefit in enterprizes, and the defeating the promotion of the human good and benefit in raising wealth, and Property, would be the consequence ; and if practicable, the misery and de structiveness to human good at large, would be the effect of it. The duties of man in regard to justice requiring an equal con sideration in regard to rights, cannot be applied or extended to an equality of the good, from the evil it would evidently produce, and the impracticability of it. What then, is an obvious question that may be asked, is to be understood in justice, as an equality in rights, and respect and consideration of one another in their rights ; if it does not apply to an equal consideration of men in regard to their good being equal good ? The equality of right in justice, and the duties of men conse quent of equality of rights to have equal respect and consideration of one another in their rights, applies to such good as men may possess in their rights ; which good, may at all times vary, and"], [159, "AS THE SOURCE OF RIGHTS. 141 never can be exactly alike, or equal ; and which good, therefore, may be larger or greater, that rights extend over with some men, than with others. The duty of men in regard to justice equally to consider and respect the rights of one another in their good, is a respect of that which is their good, of whatever it may consist. But this is not to respect or consider men equally in good, in a view to equalize that good ; but to regard and respect that good which men may have right to, be the good greater or less in one than another the same equally in respect or consideration the one as another. Equality of rights, and in respect and consideration of one an other in such rights, therefore, applies to such good as men pos sess in their rights, be that good greater or less in one than another ; and the equality of right is an equality of consider ation or respect, but is not an equality of the good itself, which must of necessity almost constantly be greater or less in some, than it is in others. Moral rights have been shewn to be the esteem or approval of men of the good, but a separate and distinct matter from the good. The one the mind's conception or idea in favour of that it approves. The other that, which it approves. The esteem of life is not the same thing as life, the esteem of property is not the same as property, and the esteem of justice is not the same as justice or the act of equal consideration. It is therefore quite obvious that rights being the approval, or esteem of that which is good, and the good that approved or esteemed, rights may be equal, while that which rights apply to or that approved may not or cannot be so. Equality of rights may therefore exist, and equality of respect and consideration of one another in their rights ; and it is the duty therefore of men in such respect and consideration to consi der one another equally in their rights, and in that good whatever it may be their rights extend to ; but although their rights are equal, the good their rights entitle them to, or in regard to which their rights give them claim to respect and consideration, may be greater or less and cannot be equal. In exemplification of what has been stated that equal rights are not the same as, or do not give equal good, let us consider that if"], [160, "142 THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT men supposed because rights are equal, all men have right to equal good, then every one in want or less beneficially circum stanced than another, might claim an equality of good from those better off; and take from those, who by their industry and pro sperity were enjoying the fruits of their labours. Equality of good would do this. But this we should say was robbery, and equality of good in practice would be this, for whoever had an unequal share of less value, would help himself to the possessions of another who had more. The impossibility of such a state to compass any good, must be obvious to all ; and the absurdity of equality of good proves the idea to be at once erroneous, and no principle to govern moral reasonable man, that could be acted upon. We trust therefore it is sufficiently evident that equality in rights does not mean equality of good, but equality of considera tion only of men in regard to the good they possess, and their rights extend to ; and that hence the error of equal rights giving men equal good, and thus equalizing all Property by those who may suppose so, as a matter of justice and principle cannot be reasonably maintained. And that equality of rights properly ex plained can only mean and apply to equal consideration and claim and title in such respect, but that it is not an equality of the good that such right or consideration applies to. It is in the explanation of moral rights and shewing whence the authority of them arises or proceeds, that we have been en abled to explain that rights are an equality of esteem, but not of the thing esteemed, which we apprehend has been the confusion in men's minds on the subject of equal rights giving equal good, or an equal share in the things or good the rights applied to. But under the idea of natural rights, although in reality only power or ability, yet morally considered, certainly the claim of all to the things of nature in common, and equally, would ap pear the only idea attached to justice, however by experience or practice men might and do find the evil, and the impossibility of the principle in practice. This affords an illustration of the doctrine that rights are granted or are an act of approval by man, and not inherent. By the investigation of moral rights, this truth or fact is made"], [161, "143 AS THE SOURCE OF RIGHTS. to appear, that equality of rights is not equality of good. The former is an estimation of mind, the latter a matter dependent on circumstances. But in innate or inherent rights, if such really did exist, the right being inherent in the thing or matter itself, to which rights was ascribed, or supposed to exist, or attach ; rights morally considered, being equal in all, right to equal good must be a necessary consequence or conclusion of the human rea soning. And we therefore, by shewing in this discussion of moral rights, that rights are not innate or inherent, but acquired ; and are distinct from the good, being a claim or title to it, whatever that good may consist of or be, but not the good itself, it clears up this error, and moral difficulty in moral rights if they were in nate, that would be irreconcileable with the human benefit, and the advantages of society and moral government, both on account of its evil and impracticability. For an equality of good never could be settled, ascertained, or arrived at ; and the moment any individual, by his own industry, talent or merit, raised himself above his fellow creatures, and matter not whose benefit, were it the thousands and millions of society depended upon such accumu lation in partial possession, it would be defeated or destroyed by the attacks and plunder of those less skilful, meritorious, or fortunate. A state of things palpably absurd, unjust, and impracticable, in any state of peace, quiet, or happiness of man. And yet if rights were innate, a state of things that alone under moral consider ation, could be justified or maintained in reason according to the principle and effect of equal rights, being equal good, and which idea of rights being innate or inherent, which mankind have ge nerally conceived, preventing men seeing the difference between rights, and that which they applied to, and that they were dis tinct things, but supposing them one and the same, they could only see if rights were equal, that must also be equal which they concerned, namely, the good of men also must be equal, or other wise injustice was the consequence. But I will endeavour further to exemplify the case of equal rights not being equal good. Rights, it will be remembered, are the claims or title men have to their good, and admitting their rights to their good being equal, as they are, the right as applied to the lives of men including under this person, and every thing"], [162, "144 THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT comprehended in this, the life of man is his good his right ap plies to. Right then to his life is equal in one man the same as another, but is the good the life of man in this first instance equal. The life of man comprising in this, his person and all compre hended under it, will consist in one of greater strength, or greater mental powers, and talent ; greater skill and art, and virtue ; and these again can be improved or increased by study, labour, and industry. The health again will be greater in some than in others; and this again will aid his mental and bodily powers. And men will be, and are, as different in the greater or less de gree of good of this matter of right in life as they are in merit, powers, and talents. A man will yet have no greater right to his good of life one than another; yet it is past contradiction the good is not equal, but will be greater in one man whose life and powers in that life are superior to, or greater than another. It will scarcely be con tended that equality of rights should reduce the man of superior powers of strength, health, and intellect, and virtue, to a level with his inferior ; or were it practicable, who would agree to it ? But the dividing it, adding to it, and improving others, would be incomprehensible and absurd. The idea of equal rights being equal good, fails in the instance of life, in the evident impossibility and absurdity. But life is a matter not under the control of men, to regulate and divide, or take from one and add to another; and the idea of equal good does not apply to the case of life it may be urged. But mark the absurdity of the man who would contend for equal rights, and assert they mean equal good. No man will deny right to life, but all must see it is of the first and most important nature ; nay that right upon which right to every thing else depends on being enjoyed, is comprehended or refers, because but as things con cern life, or the being of man, can man have any interest, and right to life is right to every thing relating to that good (life), and necessary for it. Right to life is of essential importance, for right to life is essential to the right to every other good a man has or can enjoy. Right then to life is equal in all men, and equal rights are equal good, and the good in life is different in all"], [163, "145 AS THE SOURCE OF RIGHTS. men ; yet men shall not have equal good as to life, because it is not in his power to equalize that, but he shall in other things, that are in his power to equalize, or it is supposed he can equalize. Why if he cannot equalize the good of life, how can the prin ciple of equal rights be equal good, for if good is unequal in life, is not the good unequal in other things dependent on that life. Then why is the principle' of equal rights to apply to them any more than to his life? But he can, it may be contended, equalize other things, and therefore the rule of equal rights being equal good, is applicable where practicable, and such things or good as can be equalized, are therefore to be subject to the rule or principle. But this predicates that other things are in the power of men to equal ize. This is to be seen. The life of men are not equal, thus good is not equal in this respect; and the powers, capabilities, merits, and virtues of men, which their life and person comprehends are not equal. The good of men not consisting of life, will depend upon the powers of that life, the different powers will need more in that which is the greater power, and will acquire more, having the same oppor tunities and advantages of applying their powers to the other things of which the good of man consists and depends, as Property, than the inferior powers. Here will commence an inequality of good, that is, of greater good in the greater powers, and the less in the lesser powers. Will any man deny the greater good to talent, and industry, merit, and virtue, or the greater good required by the greater strength of bodily power, but equalize it with the less meritorious, deserving, and not requiring it : and then those who contend that the greater good should be denied to the most deserv ing, or those whom prosperity favours is that idea or meaning of men in what they approve or esteem as the good, and consequently derive their rights to it ; and they are driven to the absurdity of considering the acquisitions and reward of labour and merit being denied to the virtuous and meritorious, as right, and good, or proper, which they cannot do in reason ; and if they cannot do this, where lies the right which exists but in what they approve ; and which right alone justifies the equalizing the good in the estima- L"], [164, "146 THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT tions of such men, were it practicable. . The absurdity must stamp him who would maintain such a position with a fatuity that would place him out of the pale of consideration of a being pos sessed of intellect. But the equalizing of good must be a fair and just division and distribution, or it will not be fair or just, or according with the rule that equal rights are equal good. The impossibility of this, shews the perfect absurdity of the idea or principle, and that it is in fact, as we have shewn it to be, an erroneous principle or idea, arising from mistaken or erroneous ideas that rights are innate, and that rights, and good in matter or substance, act, deed, or measure of consideration, are one and the same; and that rights being equal, it follows of consequence that good must be equal also, or ought to be equal in all men ; than which no con ceit can be a greater error, or more evidently impracticable by all experience. But to expose the error with regard to equality of rights, that it is mistaken for equality of good, that has prevailed in some men's minds, do we conceive it necessary to enter into the refu tation, by shewing its absurdity and impracticability. Explain ing, as we hope we have, in shewing the authority of rights, that rights, or man's approval, are not the good or thing approved, and equality of rights do not mean equality of good, but of claims and consideration of the good, whatever the good may be, men may possess in themselves, or their property ; and for the further purpose, to shew the advantages iii obtaining a better or more correct knowledge of moral rights, by shewing their source or au thority, and in giving correct notions of rights, shewing, although rights are equal in all men, they do not mean equal good. Although we trust we have made it plain, that equal rights do not mean equal good, yet there may be cases wherein a colour may be given to the idea that they are one and the same. The instances where this may arise, or appear, therefore, ought to be mentioned that the distinction may be seen, and not be mistaken or confounded. Although in a general view of the case, the good of men never can be equal from the circumstances affecting such, as the different powers, talents, and merits of some men over others, and the fortunate circumstances of some, which do"], [165, "AS THE SOURCE OF RIGHTS. 147 not, and cannot apply to all. Yet, there may be cases where the good of all concerned, are considered equally, and it would be unjust not to do so. Such may be instanced where a plot of ground is to be divided equally between all who may have or de rive one common or equal benefit or good in it; or where a divi sion of land or treasure, or things of value, are to be made among persons, no one of whom have greater pretensions to it than another ; or none are possessed of any share or interest by their own merits or acquirement; rights here of each being equal, will govern the division. Such cases may be instanced also in chil dren after the decease of parents, dividing their property; or where persons agree among themselves that the joint produce of their discoveries, plans, schemes, contrivances, labours, or acci dental fortune, shall be divided equally. These and similar cases form particular cases distinct from what is the general case of good or generally as to Property and acquirement of it. But even such cases as alluded to, do not establish the case or fact of equal good belonging to men as of equal right, they are equal good only to a portion who benefit by them, and to them only temporarily, as the greater merits, time, and circumstances may vary the original possessions of each; but as to any others, or the rest of the world, they shew as a general case, that good is not equal. The very fact of that portion only that are partially benefited by the equal division of a particular Property, is a benefit more as to those than others have or possess who do not participate. So that the fact holds, or is still the same that good cannot be equalized in a general view, although rights are equal. I have, therefore, now to call the attention of my reader on what has been said, and briefly recapitulate, that it appears that every individual human being have their rights, and the co-exist ent duties imposed in the human mind by the judgment, ap proving what is good, and we only here unfold or explain how the mind acts by its judgment, in regard to the being, man, pos sessing it, concerning the subject it is considering of man, or the power moral of mind, in its moral application. But men can have no other apparent ground or authority for their doing good, in regarding one another in this respect, than what is moral and l2"], [166, "THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGMENT, ETC. 148 reasonable, and, therefore, approved by their judgment. But their judgment approving the good they regard it, and give men their rights to it, and in their rights men have a rule, for what they ought to have, or be regarded in, but on no other ground, morally speaking, do we see, that men do good, or admit they ought to do it, or that they have rights to their good, but by their judgment, as reasonable beings, approving it. The judgment of men, then, is evidently the law or authority of man approving the good and giving him his rights, and im posing his coexistent duties in this respect ; and in the rights of man, affording him a rule for his direction on that which is gene rally approved as good. It is only because men approve what is good they have sanc tion in it, and justify themselves in all they do as regards it, and condemn the contrary. But his judgment, as we have observed before, and trust fully established is his sufficient authority and justification, and is not to be considered lightly of, or less valued because a matter of opinion or esteem. It is an opinion founded on facts existing in himself, in the object of his own good, and of every thing dear and of interest to him, known to all men, and in which there can be no mistake, and all mankind coincide in one concurrent sentiment, by the standard, the subject of their moral consideration of man himself, they all have to refer to, of approv ing the good. On this estimation of the approving judgment of man, rests the rights of man and all his claim and title to his good, and to be respected and considered, and is he bound in his duties to wards others. Whether the subject is important, therefore, to man, the en quiry made on it, and to settle and ascertain the fact, and what it authorises and justifies him in, namely, his rights, I leave to man himself to say, setting the facts before him. Some matters, with regard to the exercise or practice of rights, and the rule they offer, being apparently opposed to them and other matters, apparently being incongruities with them ; I shall in the next argument, notice these, and make some general observations upon them ; and shall especially consider the subject of the rights or claims of the poor to relief."], [167, "GENERAL OBSERVATIONS, ETC. 149 ARGUMENT IV. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON RIGHTS AS AFFECTING OR CONCERNING THEM IN PRACTICE. Rights and the duties of men having been established, there are several points applying to the subject that require notice, to guard men against errors or mistakes that might arise relative to their rights and duties, and that are very necessary to be men tioned. No doubt I may not advert to all, that observation may be proper to be made on ; but those points and questions com monly occurring, and obvious, I shall endeavour to bring under consideration, and for any omissions, or the imperfect manner of our viewing them, throw myself on the kindness of the reader, always admitting in what I may say the liability to error, and be_ ing open to conviction where any really may be shown to exist; and for any omission or deficiency hoping others more able may supply them, or that through what may be observed here, it may lead to further and better elucidation of the subject, and afford better instruction to mankind. I have for the general direction in regard to rights, considered the subject practically under the three great and obvious matters of which his, man's, good consists, namely, Life, Property, and Justice. And as I am here proceeding further upon the subject to throw further light and illustration upon this part of it, I pro pose making some further remarks relating to these subjects of his rights, and the more definite matters in which that esteemed good consists, in regard to the practice or effecting it. If, however, in these remarks there is a repetition of what I have said on a former occasion, I have to crave the reader will excuse it as necessary for connecting the observations on the subjects which are again treat ed on for further illustration and instruction. In a general view of the subject, men do not, I consider, re quire their own individual good in their rights pointed out, nor any urging towards their attainment or promotion. Though it"], [168, "150 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON RIGHTS may nevertheless happen, and many instances might be referred to, where men bora and bred under a suppression of their rights, do not seem aware of all the good, to which they may aspire, and are content to remain in the state in which they are born without any elevation of their moral character as men ; a confirmatory in stance only of what has been often observed by authors, and is a general observation among men, that the human mind accommo dates itself to the situation in which it may be placed, and aspires to or recognizes nothing beyond what it has been taught, or of which it has experience ; and without expansion by enquiry, the good that is every instant placed before men, in their own benefit and happiness is not regarded as their right, but rather as the favour bestowed by another mortal, who nevertheless in moral consideration is only an equal with themselves in their rights and claims. Men want no urging towards the attainment, or promotion of their own good ; yet may be in many instances supine, to their rights. The distinction is clear. Their good as their benefit, or what they so consider, all are prompted to it. But their rights, as a claim, or title, to it, is a matter of mental action, or consideration ; and as a matter of acquire ment, a matter not known to some ; faintly to others ; and on a scientific and enlarged idea, but of comparatively modern acquirement of the philosophers, may we say of the school of the great Locke ; but yet contested and disputed by many, as to its correctness, or existence, and not distinctly recognized, as to the ground or authority from whence arising, or emanating to the present day : therefore rights as a matter of acquirement in reflec tion, and consideration, is a matter of knowledge, and that of which all men may not be possessed. But we say men want no urging to their good, commonly speaking, inclined as we are in the self-love of our common na ture. This is a sufficient and ready prompter to the most blind and illiterate in morals, and the most abject in discipline and habits. Men therefore all of common accord in self-love being urged to their good, will require no argument or stimulus from the moralist to incline him to the object of his rights. The knowledge of his"], [169, "AS CONCERNING THEM IN PRACTICE. 151 claim and title is that alone he requires information upon, and it is important I say that he should be correctly informed on what this is derived from, its source, or authority ; and I do not say that convinced and satisfied of his authority for his good, and the legitimate promotion of it ; that the impulse of nature in favour of the subjects of it, will not be stimulated, nay, very greatly so, beyond any extent to which may be imagined, by the satisfaction, that he is fully intitled to what his inclinations naturally lead him. It is not required to urge men to the attainment or promotion of the object of their rights in their own individual good or wel fare, their rights being explained to them, the stimulus is in themselves towards the attainment of the object. I consider therefore I have, in setting forth the claims of men, only to ad vise them of their limits ; and to this end I admonish them, that in their claim to their good, that good is limited by the due and equal consideration of the rights of others, and their good in their rights, the same as themselves. In the estimation of rights no distinction is known or can be made between men, all are alike included in the estimation of rights morally considered, and concluded by that estimation. And it would be absurd or ridiculous to suppose or assert the contrary, the good in men's consideration being that of men; and the standard of judgment, in man himself, no one can stand upon any precedence before, or different, to another. The good is that of man ; unless it could be shown man is not the same creature every where, and in every part of the world, there can be no dis tinction, or difference, between, or as to, men and their rights in their estimation of what is good, and the claim to that good, by their rights. As all have rights, and morally stand in equal degree to one another, the limit and restriction in the object of their rights, namely, their good, is necessarily required by the consideration or respect due to those of others. Such of necessity impose on men, that they are not to look to, or can they have more right to their good, than is compatible with an equal consideration of the rights of others as well as of themselves, and forms a limit to their rights. The \"rant of rights imposes a duty in respect or consideration"], [170, "152 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON RIGHTS necessary for the rights of others ; and this limit, and this duty of respect and consideration of others, is a matter not less im portant in considering the subject of rights, and obtaining the knowledge of their source and authority whence derived, than the establishing of the source and authority whence rights themselves are derived. And this duty is a matter of more necessity to be impressed on men, as opposing the inclination towards what is ap proved in rights, the natural inclination of men toward that their rights concern, existing in too great force or degree to permit them to think of those of others, or make them forget, or inducing them not to regard, rights in others. Therefore that which men in their own natural promptitude and inclination, and which is further promoted by a consideration of their claim and title and justification in their rights, are so strongly urged towards, as they are in their own good, make it the more likely that they should overlook, or forget, or not be inclined to restraint ; and the more necessary is it to recall them to a sense of the rights of others, and the duties imposed on them in the grant of their own rights, to respect those of others. It is in the natural inclination of all men in the animal nature of man or self-love, and the mind untutored in moral science, or knowledge, and applied no otherwise than aiding and supplying the wants, desires, passions, and capricious propensities, that the breach of duty arises, and hence the greater necessity of law, and too probably the necessity of the greater severities practised in ancient times to enforce such moral observances as are neces sary for society, and to preserve order and peace, and dispense justice. It is the limit then of men's rights and the duties of men we have more occasion to call, and urge, to their attention and to re spect, than to point out or urge them to their good, or that which their rights concern, such being that which all are inclined to in nature, and being inclined to, know ; while the limit of their rights in their duties is the limit and restraint in that, they are all inclined towards; and duties hence as opposed to their inclinations, what is to be acquired or learnt, and men require more warning upon and instruction, than in that which is agree able, as their rights are, and in their object is taught or learnt"], [171, "AS CONCERNING THEM IN PRACTICE. 153 through the natural means of self-love, or what is little more than mere animal instinct. The necessity of an investigation of moral rights, as to their source or authority, cannot be more apparent than in their use fulness, to adduce their duties, and establish them ; as showing on what their rights rest, establish their duties in the same au thority, and beyond all contradiction or denial or mistake. As man in recognizing his rights as a matter of moral grant, or rais ing, by the judgment, of necessity sees the duties coincident with their rights ; and that the one cannot be without the other, simultaneously ensuing, and from the same source or authority, namely, the human judgment. Does it need exemplification to man, by reminding men of the fact of their proneness to their own good, or interests, real or imaginary ; and that only in the regard or respect of others is it required to interdict men in too great indulgence, or considera tion of themselves, their own will and inclinations, and in in vading and annoying others in their rights and their interests ? But to impress upon men their duties towards one another, has ever been the great business and difficulty in morals ; and it clearly will in deriving their rights from one another, not be less pressed upon their consideration, the 'obligation they are under to one another for their rights, and the recognition of their duties with their rights. There is however a circumstance in the consideration of duties, which requires observation to be made on it ; and although it has previously been adverted to, yet as I am here explaining further upon the subject of morals in considering moral rights, I deem it necessary to advert again to the circumstance, especially on the point now under consideration in reference to duties. All men by their rights are justified in the adoption and pur suit of their own good. The common dictates of nature in self love direct men to their own good, and the judgment of men ap proving it grants and confirms their rights in this respect; and at the same time men are bound or required to respect and consider one another in their rights ; and the duties thus imposed, require they should not injure or prejudice one another in their good and their rights in such respect. But men cannot exercise or enjoy"], [172, "154 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON RIGHTS their rights without in some degree prejudicing others. A man cannot pursue and adopt or do what is necessary for his own life, safety, or existence in some instances, without doing what may prejudice another ; and especially, as concerns Property. A man cannot have or enjoy this in crowded or populous states without prejudice or injury to others, or without others suffering for want of that which another supersedes him in as to claims, or in his right to his Property. That the distinction of the case may be seen, where men can not act without the prejudice of one another, or such may occur, and men shall not be held responsible; and where they shall be held responsible : and that men may not confuse that evil, if evil it can be called, which of necessity and for the general interests and good of all men cannot be avoided, but with the sacrifice of rights and the justification of men seek ing and doing what is necessary for their good and welfare : That men, I repeat, may not confuse the unavoidable evils and sufferings of life in the necessary transactions of men and society, with that which is unnecessary and avoidable, and therefore the duty of men not to commit, it is proper then to consider in what respects these affections of the interests of men may occur, and cannot be avoided, and yet men have their conduct or actions re gulated, or may pursue or enjoy their rights, and be justified in these respects ; and where the duties of men to one another, al though imposing the respect and consideration of each other's rights, such are not interposed, or do not require men to regard each other, by yielding or relinquishing, their own good, or where the restrictions or limits which are required for the regard of the rights of others, do not apply in the exercise and enjoyment of their own good. Let us see then first with regard to personal rights. Men in the very act of preservation of their lives, their maintenance or existence, will not be able in many cases to do so without preju dice or injury to others. Men often times in saving themselves from immediate and imminent dangers may unavoidably occasion the injury or sacrifice of the lives of others. In obtaining food or subsistence they may, in supplying their own wants, take that, the want of which, and but for another previously taking it, may"], [173, "AS CONCERNING THEM IN PRACTICE. 155 cause another to perish from hunger, such may be, and happily are cases of rare occurrence ; but such may happen. There are cases which unhappily are not of unfrequent occurrence ; these are those of necessity in self-defence both of Person and Property ; particularly of the former, when unjust or unprovoked attacks are made, or are threatened and about execution ; the destruction of the assailant may be a measure oftentimes of necessity. Men, however, having due regard of others, in the pursuit of their own rights, and having a just and equal consideration of others, where in their power, and doing them no wilful or wanton injury, and none but what is unavoidable in pursuing their own rights equally with others, which they are justified in ; those so acting, cannot in reason be held accountable for the prejudice to, or injury sustained by, others. The precepts of virtue are the rules of direction for men, or what point out how men should conduct themselves, or regulate their actions ; and the contrary, the vices, or those modes that necessarily must produce mischief or evil, point out what they are to avoid : and these rules as they are ob served or not will ever govern men in the estimate of the human conduct, for the plain and obvious reason, that one is beneficial for men, and the other course injurious. With respect to property, men in their rights to their own Pro perty, and in obtaining and increasing their own wealth, what ever is possessed by one, or gained or obtained, is necessarily a prevention to another having the same, and so far may be consi dered a prejudice or injury to another. The constitution of Pro perty implies this, but then the compensating good is by increase of stock and stores, employment, and arts, others receive benefit by, that otherwise never would have had being, and being, could not exist but for constituting Property, or appropriation of those things of which it may consist, and holding that in respect, which is appropriated. Whatever moreover one man from time to time obtains, gains or acquires, is depriving another of that, or pre cludes others from obtaining the same, and such in a measure may be to the prejudice of another. But such possession or ob taining Property by one, to the exclusion of another, or others, is a necessary effect of its constitution, or in the appropriation of things. Nevertheless there are rules respecting Property, the"], [174, "156 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON RIGHTS possession of it, and obtaining it, and dispensing it, that men can follow, practice, and adopt, without more prejudice or injury to others than is unavoidable ; and by which men can hold their rights, and pursue their acquirements, with good and benefit to society. These rules observed, the deprivation of the less fortu nate, or the suffering they may endure, the possessor of Property cannot be held accessory to, or accountable for, and provided a man obtains his Property honestly, acting fairly and justly by others, and without fraud or robbery, cruelty or oppression, or undue means or advantages : and in the using of what he obtains gives employment to others, and charity, and in dispensing it renders it useful and of benefit as opposed to the abuse of it by hoarding or rendering it useless, denying the calls of necessity and distress, where otherwise it cannot be made available to the possessor, or others, who may need it. Rights in Property involve many complex modes. That is, it is of good to man, and is necessary for the welfare of society, while others in want may be suffering, but the greater good, and more requisite and necessitous establishment of it in society, or in the community of mankind, countervail the evils, that may be experienced by the possession of one person causing the distress of another, and in deprivation a denial to their wants. It may be most important and useful to make some further ob servations on the subject of Property, to explain the nature or constitution of it, to prevent any erroneous ideas arising in the minds of persons, who, wishing to consider the origin of it, or how it is constituted, rather than merely adverting to that which may be denominated Property, and taking for granted that it is duly constituted, may direct their enquiry and attention to the way in which that which may be considered Property owes its origin or constitution. In considering that which may be termed Property, admitting the necessity of it for the benefit of man, and therefore the good of it, and the approval of man, and the regard of it and respect of men's rights to that so termed, it may be asked \u2014 whence is the original appropriation made, or what is it, that con stitutes, or justifies the particular appropriation of that call ed Property, or gives to each man what is considered or"], [175, "AS CONCERNING THEM IN PRACTICE. 157 claimed to be their respective Property, in whatever it may consist, be it land or the produce of it, or houses or other mat ter of human ingenuity and creation, and that claims the respect and regard of it. For a man, or any portion of men setting up a claim to things, on their own appropriation, apparently would never justify their right, or be a reason to demand the considera tion and respect of others towards them, or their rights in respect to that, they might so claim as their Property. I have referred generally to the term Property, meaning that whatever it may be, and wherever, in whatever land or country, and to that which is so considered as belonging to each in their possession as such, or considered as their particular right and claim as such, be it what it may or where it may. The enquiring mind will naturally ask but whence is the origi nal appropriation made, or under what form, mode, or circum stance is it derived, or what are the means or signs by which we know the things to be appreciated, so as to be considered Pro perty. The origin of municipal or the legislative laws of that which may be considered as Property, is not here the immediate sub ject of our enquiry, but whence, we should respect Property or what constitutes or makes that appropriation of things termed Property, that the judgment approves, and imposes the respect of men to it, is the immediate point on which I am calling the at tention. What then we refer to in any case that may be considered as an appropriation of things termed Property, that, in the hu man judgment requires our respect, is that possessed or claimed by men any where found to be received or recognized as such, whatever it may consist of, or wherever it may be. Appropria tion is recognized of whatever things is said to be Property, be there or not any government or established rule or authority for the directing or ruling men or laws. But where laws exist they regulate it. It will be open to question, dispute, and contest, and the consent of others where assumed by the individual, for without consent or some acknowledged rule of recognition, no assumption would make what any one appropriated, his own, ex clusive of another, as whatever it might be, the consent of all is ,"], [176, "158 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON RIGHTS necessary to consider it a right in one exclusive of another. But then that consent is given, is inferred, assumed, or taken for granted, in the obvious good to men resulting in Property or ap- propriation, for all men do appear to recognize what is Property, in every state of men from the rudest states of man to the most refined and cultivated and complexity of interest. So that all mankind do appear to approve the right in Property, or the ap- propriation of things ; and whatever may be considered as such, the respect or consideration of it, or the duty of men, necessarily follows in the right. This is witnessed in every instance from the appropriation of spears, clubs, and huts of wild Indians, and the game they take, to the division of land and the product of cultivation of the earth, the animals on it, and products of labour, art, and industry in the most populous and civilized states. The difference is only as to nature and extent, but Property itself is universally known, and the right acknowledged by all mankind. Property, therefore, may be said to be, that which has the ad mission of men to belong to those who apparently claim a right, exclusive of another ; and such is a matter of respect and con sideration to be regarded as such. It is as morally dependent on men, certainly open to invasion, or being attacked, taken away, or disallowed by others : but the obvious good or necessity of it for that good, is so well recognized by all men, that all men assume the right is known : and is a jus tification to defend what is so considered. And where such right is not known, or may be pretended to be denied, or is not re spected, then men are equally intitled, to defend what they con sider as such, as those may be, who assail them, or to take it away or not respect it. For, if the Property or rights in things is not acknowledged, then neither is any right acknowledged in him who would take it away, or not regard it ; and the contest for it will be as well justified in the one claiming it, as in him who would not recognize such right. From the practical knowledge men have of Property, it is suf ficient to refer to it, by such term, in reference to rights. How ever, I have considered it satisfactory, and therefore proper, to explain morally the mode of its constitution, or recognition, be fore making the observations I have deemed necessary on the"], [177, "AS CONCERNING THEM IN PRACTICE. 159 subject of Property, on points and questions that will offer them selves to notice, that being of difficulty, or involved, all may not understand, or may mislead some minds until explained. In this origin, there is not, nor can be, any formal rule or mode to mark what is, or is not, Property, or considered as appropri ated. It consists in the recognition of any thing deemed Pro perty, and to such, the right is given or considered to be granted, in men approving the good in it, or wherever it may be, or what ever it may be, and to be in men, to whom it apparently or osten sibly belongs, or claim it, no other pretending a prior claim or right to it. It is evident laws and rules would soon attach themselves to Property, for men's convenience, and to prevent contest and dis pute ; and that in settled states, or governments, or with people among whom there was any acknowledged authority, laws, and re gulations would arise, and be established: These, then, will super sede the moral right apparently, which rests upon the human judgment in the good or benefit, but has no mode of marking, or rule for deciding beyond apparent possession, or claim, and such laws will be the direction of men of what is considered as Pro perty in such states*. But the moral right in the esteem of men or judgment approving it as good, rides over it, as the law of the human judgment for his direction to regard and respect it, and impose and raise his duty in such regard or consideration, corre sponding and acting in union and sanction with the laws that re gulate or control it, and governing men in respect to Property, where the legislative or constituted laws do not reach it. Considering the right advocated of all men over Property, and the claim all have in respect of it, the fact, though a prevailing principle in all human proceedings, may, and it undoubtedly will, to many, be a novel and new principle, and so it may be con sidered in the noticing. But it is only in the notice of it, that there is any thing new. In this sense, viewing it as a novel prin ciple, from men not seeing or discovering the law or rule of con sidering one another in relief as a right. A right in the poor to relief and a duty therefore in others possessed of Property to * Paley gives the right to the law of the land at once, to save all further trouble."], [178, "160 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON RIGHTS have respect or consideration of them in their wants and necessi ties, and to supply the relief required to alleviate their distresses. I consider difficulties may arise in the application of the prin ciple viewed as a right, in human transactions as to practice, both in morals, and in policy ; though under due or deliberate consideration where such could be given, of the principle de veloped, all or any difficulty would soon disappear, or rather the course of action to be observed in regard to it, would be evident. Mankind, heretofore, it would appear have not seen the claim of the poor as a right, or, if they have, it does not appear to be ad mitted by them, although practising the measure by actually af fording relief to the distressed. To prevent any mistake, or misapplication of the principle, I beg to offer the views here taken of the principle in practice, of the claims and relief of the distressed part of a community. A right or claim of society at large is shewn to be existing on Property, in regard to the distressed portion of it, in virtue of their claim on it. For rights altogether exist, including Property, but in the concurrent approving of good, and thereby depending on, or beholden to the suffrages of every man in approving the good, who thereby has a claim acknowledged, by his approval or consent. Whatever rights, men have, they must be subject to the control and regulation requisite for the welfare of society, which is in fact only effecting the good granted in the approval of the human judgment, and the objects of the rights given, that of the good, and benefit of society, and of the men in society. This principle, past controverting, is indeed self-evident in it self, when once shewed cleared of the confusion in men's minds under which they first are apt to consider rights. I have, in ap plying the principle of the claim of the distressed on Property, merely to see, in what manner as to extent of claim, relief is to be afforded, or can be afforded, in any state or community where the necessity of the consideration of it, as unfortunately will but too probably at one time or other, and more or less in degree of intenseness, occur in every state or society. For the peace and order of the state and society in any coun try, the distressed, cannot be, any more than others in wantonness, admitted to take the relief of themselves out of the ordinary"], [179, "AS CONCERNING THEM IN PRACTICE. 161 course of moral or legitimate acquirement, as labour, industry, means of employment, and honest obtainment of a living, or through the course or operation of laws, into their own power or discretion. There would be an end, if they were all to help themselves, of all security of Person and Property ; and the welfare of the whole, dependent upon order and security, would be annihilated ; and the benefit of the invader of other's rights, would be very temporary ; as again in turn, by the same rule, they would have no security against others ; but the result, from the anarchy and un settled state of society, would be want, riot, and universal plun der and contest, and from civilization men would revert to an un civilized state. Of distressed persons in any community or society, two classes may be noticed. Those on whom sudden and extraordinary cir cumstances bring distress ; such as tempest, flood, earthquake, fire, and other dire catastrophe, has reduced ; and comprehend ing, perhaps, great failures and stoppage in trades and manu factures in highly commercial countries, and other extraordinary circumstances which have deprived people of the means of live lihood. And that, of the common or ordinary poor, arising from poverty, age, sickness, and incapacity to work ; the ordinary sources of labour whence they derive their employ, stopping, or ceasing for a time ; a total want of employ ; and a superfluity of labourers and workmen, and others, for the work or labour re quired, and without means of sustenance. It is to the latter I more direct my attention, because a con stant effect existing in society, calling forth our humanity, and the best efforts of our moral powers to understand and meet prac tically with its object in the good of mankind. For the common poor is a moral effect, or arising from that state of men, proceed ing from the exercise of the moral powers in society, in attaining the object they are directed to in the human good ; and affords a matter of difficulty to reconcile with that object, and to effect re lief in it ; being a matter of human suffering, which in every moral consideration, and in reason, it is the object and purpose of mo rals to prevent, and provide against. But as the case of the poor M"], [180, "162 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON RIGHTS appears a matter unavoidable in all large and extended societies, and of a certain density, it must be considered as an evil, if it so can be called, men are exposed to, that is unavoidable, and must therefore be experienced, borne, and endured by some; and the business with the object in view of morals, is the mode in which it is to be met and alleviated, efficiently for those who suffer, and with least prejudice to the general interests of society, for which appropriation or Property is essentially necessary. As to the former classes, they being of casual, and generally temporary nature, I do not intend entering on them ; but leave the exigencies to the periods when, and as they may hap pen; only mentioning such as exemplifying instances, wherein the general claims of all men on Property, or the things whereof it may be constituted, may draw forth occasion to exercise the general right of all men, to their good, recognized in the general purpose or object of morals, that of good. In order to administer the relief required to the distressed, let us first consider the nature and extent of the rights of the distressed, or the rights of those requiring relief. We will view mankind in a state of society, or at least of community, where respect and consideration, and order and regularity are re quired for the peace and good of society, and man in that state. The rights of all must bear reference to the rules and regulations that are requisite for the good of society at large, and hence is the necessity of respect of Property, although in unequal divisions, and although that held by the possessors may deprive others of a share, or what may be requisite for their support and benefit. The rights then of persons to relief, cannot apply to the dis memberment or annihilation of Property, and the claim upon it should be in the extent and mode as little to interfere with, or draw the disposition of it, out of the course, or order and purport of the rights of the owner or possessor as may be practicable, with the object and means to be taken for relief. The object of relief in its most extended view, cannot be ex pected to comprehend more than sustentation, decency, and pro tection. And in all instances where the individual can assist"], [181, "AS CONCERNING THEM IN PRACTICE. 163 themselves, the demand upon others would be unreasonable, and infringing on the grant of rights, free of the interference of others, as practicable. Beyond this, Property, industry, trade, and commerce, on which the general welfare depends, is disturbed, and diverted from its free and natural, or usual channels, more than is re quired, and cannot be justified for the general good, and respect to rights on which it depends. It may be observed that Property, or rather that of which it consists, belongs not to one more than another, but by the con current consent of men in approving the good, and raising the rights of men to that of which Property consists. And it may be urged, if this be the case, why is a sparing hand to be had in re gard to relief. To this it is answered, that but by that consent to Property, are those means of sustenance and relief raised or created, which serve to suffice society, and afford relief to the distressed. This is the very necessity of Property and its good ; and if an unlimited claim to relief is looked for, and taken, by that means is that destroyed which has been raised for the obvious good of men in society ; and the supply invaded, or Property not respected, there the failure of supply must result, the state of the society be broken in upon and disturbed, and the whole system in which the good and happiness of all composing that society, deranged, in anarchy and confusion. It follows that in a state of society or community, that men can only exist by the rules requisite for that of congregating of men. The subject of Property is an essential, if not the first rule or measure of society, and is raised by such means ; and no such Property would have existed, but for such arrangement and order, which follow from right or Property being approved. Men, there fore, in such state, cannot draw for their relief without limit, and the least they can interfere with the rule to the right to Pro perty, requisite for the whole society, is the extent they can ex pect ; and it is for that state of society existing, where they may be, that they are indebted for such, and they could not have been in being themselves, but for such institutions. They can then m 2"], [182, "164 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON RIGHTS have no claim beyond the least interference practicable with those arrangements, and none without those rules requisite for society, of law, order, and regularity. Where and wherever the contrary has taken place, from a pres sure of society, there of necessity, the state must be broken up, and probably such has been one occasion among other causes, of the destruction of once flourishing states, communities have decayed, and poverty, and misery, and want of rule, followed. All his tory shews this, and the history of eastern nations shew, this more especially. Men, in comparing a state of wild and rude nature, which they are apt to do in considering rights, with that of settled society, make this mistake. In the desert or wilderness, all is open and unreclaimed, all is common, and men may take where, and as they will and can, as to game and wood, and wild fruits and pro duce of the earth. But this is not the case in settled society and community. Even considering tribes and nations in community, but not of settled society, respect and regard is observed to Pro perty, such as stock, goods, and cattle, and subjects of merchan dize, among each other. But settled society cannot exist with out appropriation of land, and of the produce through art and cultivation, which is required ; and rights to Property is given, through which-, the state is raised in its numbers, and the state of prosperity such may enjoy. It is evident, therefore, men can not invade, take, or appropriate, what belongs to others, without destroying the rules and regulations, or means by which that so ciety exists, or holds together. Nor can men break down and disrespect the rights given in Property, without exposing them selves to the same law or rule of invasion and plunder, they have practised on others. The rule of rights disregarded, what shall prevent men from forming leagues and bands, not only to protect themselves, but to invade others. And this, in earlier times in growing out of barbarism into civilization, and the better knowledge of morals, and its laws and rules for the universal good, was well exemplified in this country in the baronial times and feudatory institutions ; and now in predatory nations or tribes, and savages : and such"], [183, "AS CONCERNING THEM IN PRACTICE. 165 would arise, and follow again, as a measure of necessity for pro tection and good of those leagued, did we throw aside the rights raised into existence by reason and human judgment. Let men throw aside the law of rights, and assail each other for what they possess, men will cabal, and club, and form into league. Party leaders will start up, and the society will be broken down and formed into tribes and parties to maintain themselves, and their own good, and assail others as power and opportunity suits. For rights then cease, and the law of might, of warfare, spoil and plunder, and captivity ensues ! The moral power of man, by granting rights, impose and teach men universal respect and consideration of each other; and the means by which men can congregate in society in peace and har mony, multiply and render the good and happiness of millions. Moral knowledge and power unites the force of millions to protect and maintain rights, and secure them, instead of a few wretched hordes and tribes, and petty despots living in dread and misery, and preying on each other like beasts of the wilds and forests. To pursue the subject of the claim of relief, although almost unnecessary to mention, I yet consider it right to draw the atten tion to the question of superfluities and luxuries which cannot in reason, be expected by those who are drawing their immediate subsistence as a charge upon others. The relief to the poor, therefore, in reason, cannot be extended to the superfluities and luxuries of life. Every individual of society must be expected to be chargeable with his own care and maintenance, and not to be dependent for it at the cost or labour of others, further than in return or exchange for services or benefits, or compensation ren dered in the course of labour and trade ; however necessity may require that assistance be afforded to them in distress by those in affluence ; and the necessity is therefore the ground of the resort ing to the general claim which otherwise for the purpose of their maintenance from those possessed of Property is restricted or dormant. The Property acquired or raised by the industry, la bour, assiduity, and opportunity of those possessed of affluence, cannot be expected to be shared and divided between the more rich and the less rich, or the poor. For were this the case, there would cease the excitement to improvement, and art, ingenuity,"], [184, "166 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON EIGHTS and industry, which is conducive to society at large, and the ge neral welfare. Those moreover in want in all states, whether such states be the most opulent, densely peopled, civilized, or even in savage states, (for even there are poor found,) can never in reason, ex pect or look for more than what will suffice their wants, but from their own labour or good fortune. In states of society where administering to the relief of the poor is required, and there is a certain density of population, and opulence is possessed, as well as arts, commerce, and trade flou rish, it is to be considered that in such states, the funds and Pro perty of the wealthy who have superfluity, are applied and di rected in channels that employ others, and give support to those among whom it is circulated, as among different arts, trades, and manufactures. Thus employed, whenever Property has been ap plied in certain channels, it cannot be drawn from thence or ap plied in others without its being felt, and a species of distress felt where it has usually gone, being withheld, or stopped. If fine arts are encouraged, \u2014 if much furniture is used, \u2014 if carriages and horses and equipages are much employed, then are the artist and workmen, and persons employed in those trades or business, and men dependent on the superfluity of money or riches of the affluent for their support, supplied from the rich. And if such affluence or Property so employed by the rich, is called for to supply relief to the poor, the arts, trades, and manufactures de pending on the affluence of the rich, and on which these riches were before applied, will feel the loss of it; and in that loss will those they gave employment to, suffer a loss likewise. Taxations in general, of all kind, have this effect, but such are unavoidable, and these judiciously laid, and employed, are often diverted into new and other channels of employment, by which imposts are not only not felt, but by giving employment in other directions, promote a more general diffusion of wealth, and operate to the general benefit of the society. But this is not so much the case of charges for the poor, the supply of whose immediate wants are always the subject of common trade or traffick, as the necessaries of life; and the charge raised for them, notwithstanding the poor thus maintained may be differently and even usefully employed,"], [185, "AS CONCERNING THEM IN PRACTICE. 167 flow into no new course, or rather do not originate any new course or channel of employment, of the money or impost raised for their support or sustenance, and which existed before beino called forth to supply the mere necessaries of life. Although it may transfer or change the mode of trade from the hands of one to another. The doctrine of rights it may be supposed, and urged, do not admit of this construction of limit to the rights of relief implied or reserved in the grant of rights. It may be said, that the argument on which limit to the necessities only, of those wanting relief is founded, is in favour only of the possessor, and borders on absolute right ; is good for the rich but not the poor ; and it may be said, were it not that the land, or riches, or other Property, in the pre-possession of others, and those in want, consequently, kept out of it ; the distressed would be able to supply, or would have the means of supplying themselves, out of the superfluity, with food and comforts, and luxuries of the rich ; and in short, that being kept out of the possession of, or not permitted to take and apply, what another holds as Property, is a deprivation or wrong, supported only by violence and force, or power. But we must again advert to the rules and regulations necessary for society ; and that which has been raised and created through those means, and the protection it affords for effecting the good of men generally, would not have existed or been in being, but for those rules which are requisite, and the poor or distressed in a society would not have had that supply produced, by means of which their wants are supplied, but for that society ; and for that society the rules and means by which it is raised, promoted, and main tained, must be observed, or the whole fails. The poor are kept out of nothing that they could or would have had, had it not been for the society in which they have been raised, as beings, the poor, therefore, cannot be said to be wronged of that another is possessed of, through the rules requisite for society, which, but for that society, such things or Property possessed by another, would not have been in existence. At the same time, the Pro perty being in existence, and the poor in a society, as all are contributing or accessory in the grant of rights, they have claims to their \"ood. And these claims are recognized and met in"], [186, "168 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON RIGHTS affording them relief, when circumstances preclude their obtaining it for themselves, or the Property of the state being pre-occupied, none is left, or offers itself in a way of labour, or otherwise, to possess themselves of honestly for their support. This argument may have the appearance, both in what I have said and may have to say, of being laboured, but I wish to meet whatever may be urged by the destitute against those possessed of Property, even of a colourable pretence, although, when con sidered, not having any reasonable ground or pretext to rest on. The great inequality of Property, excites the desire of those possessed of little, or destitute, and makes them suppose, were it not for such an unequal distribution, they might be happier, and not experience want. These cases are calculated to excite envy and jealousy, and the desire of those in want to apportion the possessions of others among them. But we must look to the laws and rules necessary for society, which render Property secure and sacred, without which, there could not be that abundance, or those supplies, which they see others possessed of, and which alone, through rule and order, can be dispensed to society, or otherwise, that is, defeated or destroyed, namely, Property, by which alone numbers can be raised and multiplied. But for these rules, these supplies would not have been in existence, for it must be evident, had there not been an appropriation made, and Pro perty raised and established in lands and other things, produced or multiplied through human aid and agency, then would the earth continue, to all time, an open wild and common wilderness, a desert, and mankind would have continued, and would be, wild, and unreclaimed from the savage state. Men, by settling, how ever, and establishing Property in land, and all things controllable by man, and society established, man, in that society, can only subsist by those laws requisite for that state. Hence, the obvious necessity of respect to, and the sacred nature of Property, and on it, the happiness of millions raised by it are depending. The envy and jealousy raised by the large possessions of some individuals more than others, and the sufferings of want of others, whilst there is a superfluity, is a matter of necessity in society ; but such whose envy and wrong desires are raised, and who en dure penury or want, would never have been in existence but"], [187, "169 AS CONCERNING THEM IN PRACTICE. for that society ; and it would be unreasonable to disturb society for that which cannot be avoided, and for which state of society it is necessary these rules are maintained and observed, by which alone it can exist, namely, by respect of Property. But let us, instead of detracting from the rules and regulations of society, by imaginary favour or partiality, shewn for the rich against the poor, view the case as of society, and the laws and regulations essential for its existence, in the constitution or grant of rights, as the means by which the welfare of the many are raised and supported, by that respect and consideration of one another, by which men can live in peace and good will, and by means of Property the supply and support of millions are found, instead of the precarious and uncertain produce of rude nature in woods, the waters, the wilderness, or the desert, which afford but a miserable existence to a few, whose necessities opposed to each other, and scant means, render them the fiercest enemies of each other, and who live in constant horror and dread of each other, instead of being united in amity and good will, and of mutual assistance. Let us consider that, in the numbers of society, and consequently, by its rules, by which men harmonize and agree, and are rendered of mutual aid and assistance to one another, arts and science arise and flourish, calling forth the powers and energies of human intellect. That nature herself is explored, and sources of employ and subsistence found, that otherwise lies dormant and hid to man in his ruthless and uncultivated state of nature in the savage life. We are speaking here of a state of society, and of a state where all is appropriate. It might be, and is, different in a state where it may have yet uncultivated wilds and deserts unappro priated, even to herds and flocks ; and human beings, wanderers, may roam and settle unheeded and uncared for, and without con cern or interfering with rights settled and vested. A case, ne cessary to mention ; because a case, apt to be confounded and misapplied, and to mislead men canvassing rights in settled states, and societies, and where all is appropriate; comparing that, and mixing it up with cases, where there is yet unappropri ated wilderness ; and they suppose the case of land and its wild produce being open to all who choose to go, and seek there for a"], [188, "170 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON RIGHTS subsistence, the same with a case of land where it is appro priate. Whether a being's existence is bettered in settled society is another question. We have not to argue this ; we have only to look to the case we are considering, a state of society, and men's rights in that. We must look to the object before as the good of that state, and the welfare of all as concerned in that state, and the means of effecting this. That man's existence in that state is better or worse, cannot be entertained, they are subjects of it, and must be subject to that which is the good of all in that state, and by which the society can exist, that is, by Property, and a respect of that which secures it in rights. But suppose the worst, and the case of individuals in some degree, both in numbers and sufferings, are worse in civilized society, than if they were wild men and savages and had to shift for themselves ? Let us ask, is the good of the whole to be disturbed on that ac count. Are the multitudes of men raised into being and exist ence, and we will suppose the major part, nay, by far the larger part, rendered happy as beings desirous of life, and enjoying, therefore, that existence, it must be presumed ; are these to be destroyed, that the few may return to a state of savage life, or are the multitudes not to be raised into, being, through the means men associate and live, and exist associated, because the few raised in it that suffer, should be considered, and therefore, were it practicable, should not have been born into a state of so ciety, but in a state of savage life. Such is the absurd conclusion of those who argue the preference of a state of nature over a state of social civilization. Such that suffer in a society must be ascribed to owe their be ing to that state, and would not have had their being in another state of things, and taking men's existence in that state of things, they can only be considered by the rules found necessary for the state in which they take their origin, and must, in reason, be the subject of the laws necessary for society. Then, in reason, we could not disturb the laws of society, and by which alone it is raised, and can exist in respect of Property for the few who may suffer from want. But are we necessitated to argue upon this extreme view of"], [189, "AS CONCERNING THEM IN PRACTICE. 171 the worst side of the case ; that men do suffer, and suffer in so ciety, what they would avoid were it not for that state. \u2014 Is this the case, is the state of man in society in the most suffering state, worse than the wild and wandering and precarious existence of a savage ; let any man put this case to himself. I conceive the state of the most destitute and most suffering, compared to the destitute and suffering Indian ; for we must compare parallel cases, and bad as both may be, if we are driven to make the com parison, the Indian is, at least, lost past hope in the desolate wilderness. The man of society has, at least, the produce to look to, raised under its protection, the compassion of his fellow creatures, and his claim for succour, where his own means and labour fail him. Property, it is obvious, is essential for man, his good, and so ciety, and therefore, the welfare of man, individually and generally. By Property, all have a claim on it, and therefore on that which would not be without its establishment, or its being implied under the acquiescence of all in establishing it \u2014 and men raise therefore, what they could not otherwise have, by the implied reserve of a claim on it in their grant of it, or rights in this re spect. By Property the destitute of possessions raise a means of support through others in possession, and a claim for that sup port, where they could have neither support or claim to it, were property not raised or existing. On the subject of the general claim that all have upon Property, it will be a consideration, therefore, with many, if Property is un equal and is necessarily so from circumstances attending it, does not the very principles of its nature or institution shew an exclusion. And therefore proves that no such claim as that of all people of a state in the Property within it can exist, and that the admis sion of Property is, from its very nature, a justification of the total exclusion of all except the privileged possessors. The subject is, I trust, very capable of explanation, and so that all will admit the doctrine and see there is no inconsistency. I will beg leave, however, to call to the mind of the reader, that Property or the privilege, or advantage of the possessor over those things appropriated and deemed Property is of a limit ed nature, and not absolute in the possessor, which quality or"], [190, "172 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON RIGHTS limit admits the claims upon it, which claims again are stated, must be considered of a limited nature, and not a power in the discretion of men to use or exercise at licence or as they please, but under limit and restraint, by which alone Property can be secure, and the benefits of its institution be secured to man. Property, in a moral view, is that which is only allowed or agreed to by men. Land and its products, or riches, acquired by or descending to men are no more, exclusively, one man's more than another, not even his that reclaims the forest, or by his in dustry, clears the land and raises corn, or flocks, or other pro ducts, resting entirely upon his art, talent, and industry through his own act, but through rights, which are that title founded in the judgment of men, allowed and consented to by the common concurrence of mankind in their estimate of what is good, and thus morally granted, admitted, and allowed. In this judg ment of men they give right to that which a man acquires, and hence is a man's right to Property. The right is one thing, and the subject or matter of which Property consists, another, and Property, from its very nature of being a man's acquirement, may be of any extent whatever, while the right is a privilege, or a claim, or title given by man to that so acquired ; and whatever may be a man's Property, his right is as just to it, and equal with that of all other men to theirs, though in extent or quantity and quality, the Property itself must ever vary ; and which we may observe by the way, illustrates the position, that though rights are equal, good is not so, but various and indefinite, as to extent, kind and quantity. But Property resting on the rights given to it. We have argued the very nature of rights, shew a power is exerted over it by all men in raising such rights. Since then, men in granting rights never can be understood to exclude the very object for which they are raised to effect, name ly, the good of man ; and the right given to Property, as we have argued before, gives but a limited privilege, or advantage to the proprietor, over what is deemed Property, but no more, and the proprietaryship is but a means given or acceded to for bringing into use or effecting the good to be rendered, by that of which the Property may consist. But this can never be supposed to give an absolute and exclusive power or privilege, which, if the"], [191, "173 AS CONCERNING THEM IN PRACTICE. possessor took an unlimited power, he would have. Why the matter of fact of Property being the subject of laws, denies that. By rights to Property, is it conceived or conceivable, a man has an absolute power over it, or any thing but a limited right, ora power subject to the judgment of man of what is good. Rights them selves are but this judgment, and to say a man in the possession of his Property had a right beyond the power or limit or control of man, would be to say that rights were not the judgment of men ; and to say this, would be in defiance of truth and fact made evident and here established ; and must be first denied or disproved, before it can be asserted rationally, that rights are absolute, and not the subject of human judgment, consequently, of the control of men. Whatever rights, therefore, men have in their Property morally, and privileges and advantages in their rights of exclusion of others, and acting as they like according to their own individual judgment, or circumscribed by the laws ; such exclusive power and privilege is but of a limited extent. To that extent that it is necessary to encourage the skill and ta lents and industry of men, and promote the benefit and use of it, a latitude of acting, not definable in precise terms as to modes or uses, but yet to limitation by what is reasonable and good. Property, therefore, in its institution, and the rights granted men by one another to it, is the subject of the claim of all, in the object of good, and the law of the human judgment, for that purpose ; and in this sense, all men have a claim on it ; while the proprietor has the immediate control and particular ad vantage in his Property. And while rights secure to men, their Property and the benefit to society arising from it, in the object for which it is raised and established, namely, the good ; they, preserve, in that, the general claim of the society on it, and limit and restrict men in any power to abuse it wilfully, or per vert its object, which they would have, were rights absolute, or not the subject of limit, a control; for their rights would be in effect authority to do wrong at the pleasure of the possessor. It will be said if the moral rule of rights be equal does not ap ply to the good of men being equal, and that Property may be possessed very unequally, yet, that all have a claim upon it, and that when called for by necessity, the claim is to be answered,"], [192, "174 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON RIGHTS and indeed is met, or acknowledged either voluntarily or by course of law, the charges or imposts on Property to meet the claim, will have a tendency and effect to reduce the inequality of Property, and may eventually produce or effect the equalizing of Property, and in fact, an equalizing of good, and it may be said, this is, in contradiction of the explanation given, that equal rights do not give equal good, and that good may be very un equally enjoyed or possessed. It must be apparent to every one who has paid the least atten tion to what has been before said, that Property must be under stood as the subject of limit, with regard to man's rights, both as to the owner or proprietor and the claims of the society, and likewise subject to the laws. But it must be evident that all charges made on it for the relief of the necessitous in the state, or those who are poor or destitute, must reduce or take, in some degree, from the proprietor a portion of his Property, and by di minishing it, so far rendering the remainder a nearer approach to a level or equality, and thus has an effect or tendency to equalize Property and the good in respect of it ; and this, it is possible to conceive, may bring all in the society, at least, to an equality, or perhaps, we may say, worse, by rendering one and all, even the once affluent, themselves subjects of a state of pauperism. In some degree, I am afraid, there are or have been cases in this country which appear to approach this state of things, whether from injudicious laws or injudicious administration, it may be difficult to say. It is not the design, nor is it the policy of the law, but through want of caution and judgment, or fore sight, in framing laws, and of their execution. Such cases, how ever, are local and partial, and not general. To suppose the case to become general, and that all the society were reduced by the supplying of the poor, and combined with other taxation, (for taxation has the same effect, or operation, or tendency, to an actual equalization of Property,) is not a very pro bable, I will not say impossible, case: and there must be a won derful equilibrium of law, and nature, and of events, before any thing like an approach to such a state of things is conceivable, in any extent of territory. But if such did happen, who should have a right to escape or exempt himself? As when the ship is"], [193, "175 AS CONCERNING THEM IN PRACTICE. in a storm, who can escape the common dangers ? and all must bear alike the labour and hardships, ay, and share the last biscuit. In every state of society we must expect some poor, to whom it is incumbent on those in affluence to afford relief; as also, that all Property must be subject to taxes for the charge and exi gencies of the state. With respect to the poor, as the subject we have to consider here, it is scarcely possible to imagine a state of things to be such, that they should ever require such an ex action on the rich as to reduce them to an equality of fortune with those who need their assistance. Before this happened as a ge neral case, the ruin and dispersion of the rich would probably be such, that the poor themselves would no longer be the subjects to promote their claims upon others, but would themselves be in volved in the common desolation of the abandoned, and neces sarily deserted lands, and once luxuriant fields of the rich, the tenants of whom, or themselves, were no longer capable of culti vating them, from the charge upon their sources, and no capital in the market to remunerate them for their produce, and make an adequate return for their outlay and support, to be thence drawn. Long before this state arrived, famine and desperation must have succeeded on the face of that territory which, we may presume, had been prosperous, and once a happy society. I can conceive a state in which the cultivator of the land may again be the subject of more frugal habits, and limited enjoy ments, and the humble labourer raised above a state of wretched ness, and, consequently, the two classes brought nearer to a level with one another, at the same time, that this might happen in not an unenviable state, and one wherein, probably, more true happiness may be realized, than in a greater disparity between them, or in other words, without prejudice to the real happiness and substantial prosperity of the people. I can conceive, also, a more wholesome state of manufactures, and markets to exist, than a forced vigour of supply and demand for a while, but ultimately, in effect, producing a stagnation, and consequent ruin succeed ing, overwhelming with distress and despair the artisans and their families, dependants on these manufactures and trades. Yet let the claims on property, in respect of the poor, or of"], [194, "176 CENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON RIGHTS the calls of society at large in taxations, be what they may, and even to reduce the owners and proprietors to a level with the poor, or worse, still this is not, because equal rights necessarily imply equal good, but arises from a state of necessity, that is unavoid able at the time, that reduces all to a common level, and like the crew in the ship in distress, all are subject to one common danger, must bear alike the sufferings and hardships. Equality of rights are not to be understood as giving equal good, yet the good of men may be brought to a level or equality, or the good of men may be brought nearer to each other by circumstances. In a dense population, or the want of labour or employment for the poor, the relief required for the poor may reduce all Property nearer to a level, or an approximation to it. And general and national distress, or calamity, may reduce every thing to a level or eventually destroy all, but we are considering the case of the common poor. A question may be asked, how do rights secure to men their good, if a man's whole Property be thus subject to the claims of others. The answer is, they do secure to men their good, but if circumstances reduce all things to a common level, all must bear alike the calamity ; and if the claims on Property become so great, or such case happen, that all the Property in a state became in requisition for the wants either of the poor, or the exigencies of that state, and past the control of man to do otherwise than take the whole, and divide or appropriate it, rights, nor any other rule will excuse one man in his Property, exclusive of all other mortals, that he alone should complacently enjoy undisturbed tranquillity and happiness, while others perished, or could it be expected that all should suffer, that he alone may be considered. Such a selfish and miserable idea can never be maintained, or if maintained, allowed by mankind, and is an idea only of those who cannot have contemplated the nature of Property, how it is derived, or on what it is dependent, or for what purpose it was originally instituted. Let men remember the institution of Property is under an im pression, that land, and every thing besides, admits of appropria tion, by there being enough for others, or that, through that set up as Property in a settled state, or society, others shall draw em-"], [195, "AS CONCERNING THEM IN PRACTICE. 177 ployment and subsistence. If through the pressure on a state, the improvidence or inefficiency of the laws, and the density of its numbers, this is defeated, rights, no more than any other laws or rules of man, can be of avail to make men happy, the claims of all being levelled by one common distress or calamity. I beg that the reader will recollect that I am taking a view of Property least agreeable, or in that way most opposed to our feel ings. As the subject of the general claim that exists as to all Property, will no doubt be very repugnant, if not to the interests, yet to the inclinations of the proprietors. But can any proprietor suppose that the right he possesses to his Property, gives him a claim to exclude all the world from it, and no one can interfere, or in any way make any charge or regulation as to his estate. To such I would say, who gave him his estate, or his proprietary rights ? Did he give them himself, or did the society admit his rights and give laws confirmative and correspondent with rights? and if society does not admit rights and give laws, where are his rights ? If not thus given, his rights are no where. Suppose a man possessed of a very large territory in land, and his right probably to that would be less owing to his own merits, than a man possessed of a small estate, or goods and wares, the produce of his own labour and industry ; and who, therefore, in debted not so much to any one perhaps, as himself for acquiring it, might rest a better claim from merit to the exclusive power over such, than the large proprietor to his estates, but these he acquires, or what he buys, are invariably the subject of laws and duties, of taxes and imposts. Suppose then a man possessed of large territory in land, ima gining that his right being exclusive, after paying his labourers for what he chose to cultivate, or turn to useful produce, and after employing so much of the produce by sale, or other disposition of it, that would supply\" his own wants or indulgences, chose to let the remainder of his produce rot, spoil, or waste. Or suppose he would cultivate but a small part, and let the remainder be a desert or wilderness. Or slaughter all his cattle and stock, deny its use, but leave it to corrupt and breed a pestilence, or set fire to his corn or woods, and his houses. A man might do all this, if he had absolute and exclusive right over his property. He N"], [196, "178 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON RIGHTS might answer as to letting my estate lie waste, or without selling my stock and produce, or even to destroy it, this is my own loss. But as to doing a positive mischief of creating a pestilential air, or endangering my neighbours by fire, the law will take care of that, and prevent it, or punish me for doing so. But what is the difference between a passive act of not letting his estate suffice for the use and wants of society, or by his act or deed, dealing with it so as to render it noxious and destructive, in regard to the abuse of it ; and the law will prevent the latter, and the former, no one has a right to interfere with. Certainly it may not be policy perhaps, to interfere, as a general rule, as to the mode of its ma nagement, if brought into use, but not if abused, in any way, even passively, of wilful perversion and mischief, and injury of others. But if he admits the law will prevent, or prohibit, or punish him for positive injury done to the society through his wilful abuse of it, he admits an interference over him and his estate, and by what right has the law authority to do this if his right is exclu sive. The only right the law exercises here, is that power it is delegated with, in right of the general claim of society over all land, and every thing comprehended within that society or state; and if this right is acknowledged, there is the general claim ad mitted of society, for which we contend. It appears then it is no longer a question whether society has a claim on every thing in the state ; but the question is, the proper and judicious exercise of this right. The claim is shewn of laws and rules, and in taxes, duties and imposts in almost every in stance of that termed Property ; yet people enjoy their Property sufficiently secure to be assured in its enjoyment and profits, sub ject to the laws and the charges imposed on it. The claim, there fore, is shewn in regulations and laws touching Property, its ma nagement, and its use. And the claim of the poor to relief, is past question. The only point is, if required, and where re quired, the proper and judicious mode of meeting and providing for the claim ; which for the peace and order of the society, must be regulated and administered through the laws. What is stated, is an hypothesis to shew the case where the necessity of interference cannot be disputed, and therefore, if the right exists of the general claim of the society, Property is the"], [197, "AS CONCERNING THEM IN PRACTICE. 1^9 subject of that claim wherever it may be necessary to exercise it. And what is the fact ; why that all Property is subject to the laws, proving that no proprietor has an exclusive right, but that he takes his property subject to the laws, the purport of which is the good of society, and subject therefore to that good ; and for which the possessor is only an instrument or means of ef fecting ; and the effecting of which, and exercising the right in respect of it, is to be through the laws. The very rule of ho nesty and fair dealing, should tell every man his property is not his own exclusive of others, but subject to all fair claims, and the just dues of others on the proprietor. But let us take another view ; supposing a rich man possessed of the most part of a dis trict, and the stock and store in that, required for the poor and destitute, that were on the brink of famine and destruction ; that they should starve, no one will be hardy enough to say they should. By what other means than the rights of the poor and society have over Property, and the state is empowered with to charge and cess, or draw from the abundance for the care and maintenance of the poor, should we propose to relieve them ? If rights are denied the poor to relief, on what other moral course or channel are they to be relieved. Relief they should have, all will be agreed ; and if rights are denied them, on what rule of morals should they be relieved. We can only resort to virtuous precepts if rights are denied to them ; these are charity, and all the kindly principles and feeling of humanity. If we would propose relief to the poor through the virtuous precepts, and we know no other mode, if the right and claim is de nied ; and the virtuous precepts should induce the rich man to con sider the poor in charity and humanity, and that these forbid him the misuse of his Property, or to withhold his Property for the re lief of the poor, and the man of generous feelings would say more, that he could not allow his suffering fellow creatures to starve while he had his loaf to share with them. This may be all true, but where is the efficacy of such principles if the will of the rich is not correspondent with them ; and with the will, I confess I am not satisfied to leave the question. It is dependent on will, with the rich man to shut out the poor from his abundance and n2"], [198, "180 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON EIGHTS superfluity if he wills it, if property be supposed to exist in an exclusive right of all, but the possessor. Religion may be used as a stronger authority, and virtuous motive, to influence men, and advocate the claims of the poor ; and that authority that cannot be disobeyed without the highest penalty to its transgression, and who shall, under the awe of such transgression, not supply the poor and the necessitous when they are in distress and in dire need. The virtues, charity and humanity, the liberal feelings of ge nerosity, and the duties or injunctions of religion, may be re ferred to as the rules under which men are called upon or bound to regard the suffering poor, but these modes are all dependent on the good will or the conscience of the persons possessed of the means ; and in fact place the poor at the option of such for their relief or not. By the moral powers, men are directed to act and to do what is requisite for the object to be obtained : and are not alone de pendent on the mere will or option of others ; and it is on this authority that the instituted laws are grounded that sanctions and makes the charge in every state for the support of its poor. The Christian religion enjoins, nay commands, us to regard the poor, and as a claim upon the rich, and in the plainest inferences to divide with them if necessary, we must consider all our sub- stance. And the moral powers of man by his judgment, gives him his rights ; and in these rights the poor a claim on property for their relief. The moral powers are those means of direction which God, in his providence, has constituted in man for his direction, and by them the right is given to the poor on Property for their relief. An illustration of the accordance of the injunc- tions of the Christian doctrine, and the moral law in the human judgment, or the rule derived by man in the means he has for his direction by the moral powers of mind, reason, and judgment, than which nothing can be more complete or more exactly in cor respondence. The distinction is that while religion leaves it to the conscience, the relief of the poor ; the moral authority jus tifies and directs men to adopt those means that will effect it ; but religion and morals finally accord in the same object, on the subject of supplying relief to the poor."], [199, "AS CONCERNING THEM IN PRACTICE. 181 The fact is, as I have shewn, and repeatedly adverted to, that all Property in the original constitution, exists but upon the right granted by the judgment approving the good; Property being the adoption of powers and privileges over things, of which good con sists, or essential for it. But the right given is necessarily the subject of limit and restriction, and of a reserved right in all the society to their good. The policy constituting as law, or confirming the rights of men as to Property, necessarily supersede its mere moral existence or origin, and seem to be so wholly the authority to which Property is the subject, that the base on which it arises, and which the law is but secondary to in establishing, by confirming and regulating it, that in regard to Property, we retain or have no other idea than as a matter the subject of, and held under the law. The policy, however, of its establishment, and the law exercised in re gard to Property, shews the right of the society over it, the rules and regulations regarding it, and the charges it is made subject to, or to which, the owners or occupiers are liable in respect of it, being on the express purpose of the good. The same good on which government and law is based in the exigence of a state, for that good, for the service and benefit of the subjects of the state, wherever it is considered to be required, are the source of the laws and regulations in respect of Property. A doubt cannot exist that all Property therefore, is the subject of the rights of all society, but for the safety and effecting the good of that society, and that society and the good may not be defeated in the end and object of its being established, that right or general claim so ciety has on that appropriation of things deemed Property shall be exercised through the policy of government and the laws. It remains but to examine into the obstacle to the seeing, and admitting this fact of the general claim of society on that account ed Property That self-love, which is coeval with moral exist ence, in aid of which the judgment is prompted and acts spontaneously, as has been observed, is the occasion of this blindness to the claims of society on Property. Self-love is so strong, in its native influence, that it will not allow us an impartial consideration of what this moral law is, and until viewed in the light of a science of the means of the direc-"], [200, "182 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON RIGHTS tion of the being man, it is not seen that the judgment as the law gives the rule or mode of obtaining or effecting the good of that being, considered rationally and consistently. The passions and feelings in self-love, point out or call to mind the wants and necessities and raise in us the desire, and prompt the exertion to supply and provide what is required for our good in support, comfort, and security, and men are by that alone urged by personal interests as opposed to the consideration of others in the moral law. All men feel justified in the evident good of the appropriation made in Property, and in admitting the justice of considering the poor, and the necessity and justice of bearing some burthens and imposts for the state and good of society, and even to occasional attachments of capital or foundation stock, supplying their current wants and necessities; and at the same time feel happy in their possessions, and rejoice in their means, and the enjoy ment of life and happiness such afford. But in social life, it is never contemplated that a want or urgency may come when all our means may be called for or required for the exigencies of so ciety ; and that a right or claim may exist to sanction the de mand, dormant it is true. And may the extremity ever be dor mant, and ever be averted, for the right to its utmost extent, cannot be called forth, but from dire need and distress that must render a whole population to deplore the miseries of their wants, and the density of their numbers overflowing their powers of subsistence. We are viewing the subject of morals, as a matter of science, and we are not to hide from ourselves the truths and facts of cases that may be possible because unpleasant ; but we are looking to the nature of our subject, that if there be matters that are cruel to our feel ings, offensive and noxious in truth, that we may see them, be prepared for them if they do happen, or prevent or obviate the miseries that would arise did they happen. All men feel happy in their possessions ; and for the good at tached to Property we must look to that repugnance in mankind to admit a claim of right existing in society over it, and in which the right of poor exists for relief. It is well to consider our inter est and good in our possessions, and in a degree to consider others and admit of certain claims and authority of the laws, and"], [201, "183 AS CONCERNING THEM IN PRACTICE. tfhe demands of society ; but to go further and admit a right in the poor to a claim on our means for their support is too fearful, is too threatening to reduce all we have, to claims so vast and ex tensive and enormous as they portend. To this is to be ascribed the repugnance of many to the claims of the poor, and more especially to poor laws, such admitting the claim, apparently threatens all Property with a demand for their support ; and that demand admitted, to what extent may it not go, is too evident, not to excite their fears. What happiness, and what safety to the society can be contemplated, is there re maining in fact, the admission granted, is the consideration springing from their inward fondness. There are many persons while a matter of civil justice is his topic, or a political right advocated to be possessed by the society at large, or the poor serves his purpose, and a glimpse of justice stimulates his conscience into fierce indignation, I often observe shrink from the subject of the poor laws. But the doctrine promoted of late years, much favoured by po pular men or advocates of the people's rights, who at the same time deny relief to the poor as a matter of right, is good pre sumption of the fact, that repugnance to an invasion of their Pro perty is the strong influencing motive they have of objecting to the poor laws. Unwittingly I believe, in many cases, is the right denied from that proneness in self-love, to deprecate what they see must be an admission against their own dependencies, and never having gone into the subject of rights so deeply as the sub ject is capable of being probed. The annihilation of all Property, in the support of which not only their own, but the happiness of society rests, is too apparent they conceive. The doctrine admitted of the rights to the poor for relief, the liability of all Property alone is seen ; but seen, is enough to deter them, by that inward fondness prevailing with all, from the precipitation of their apparent destruction. In this dilemma some are too happy to find a relief, however temporary, as it would be, were an attachment in consequence re sorted to, of supposing that tithes are the means and are the sup ply from whence the poor are to be legitimately provided relief. I wish to avoid in purely scientific views, involving particular"], [202, "184 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON RIGHTS cases of individual's notions. But it is a point, the notion that some entertain that tithes are that provision originally intended by the law and ancient usage for the poor, and so likely to be seized on by the mind of many, and is so apt for illustrating my argument, and at the same time giving the opportunity of showing the fallacy, that as a guide or help to direct men in what is their true policy, I hope I shall be pardoned for the mention I have made of it. The sanctity of tithes as Property is surely as great, as that of any other, whatever may be the defects of its system, and espe cially as applicable to a high and improved cultivation, where a large capital is expended on the land, and that of inferior quality; and adviseable so far, if it could be, that a remedy should be found. But tithes are that supply for the clergy above all others best calculated for their support, as not drawing them away from their ministry, as land would were they to cultivate it, or exposing them to the effect of bad tenants if they did not ; and not entail ing on them the prejudicial effects of dilapidations between a de parting minister and his successor. Be this as it may, tithes as the ministry's support, are as much a Property while they are his support, as any other means of his remuneration and mainte nance, or that of any other individual in the state. In justice then they alone cannot be taken to suffice the poor, whatever por tion of burthen in common with the Property of the rest of society it may be fair they should bear. But the idea is the strongest argument, that those who would suppose tithes are liable, consider the poor have claims, or rights, that they should be provided for, and should be provided for by the state. Here then we have a recognition of the right of the poor. It only remains how they are to be provided for, and it is but too evident that if that can be done by referring it to another medium than their own Pro perty, and be the means of securing their own from the burthen, it. is too great a temptation not to approve a plan and doctrine so agreeable to that self-love of our animal nature that, inwardly moves us all. But suppose the clergy are the ministers to' take care of the poor, it would be a very erroneous idea that the tithes were, and are now the means through which the supplies are to be found."], [203, "AS CONCERNING THEM IN PRACTICE. 185 Will it not be remembered that when the clergy or the religious institutions dispensed charity and alms to the poor, their posses sions in land far exceeded all the tithe in the kingdom. That they were moreover in the constant habit of receiving the dona tions and contributions of the pious towards those objects, and that with funds more adequate and infinitely beyond their present means, the poor of the present day are increased more than a thousand fold ; and moreover the clergy or religious order were wont in former days to collect alms from all around them for the poor. How many cases are there where the tithe no longer be longs to the clergyman, in others a portion only, and in some cases where there are the most poor, as in populous towns, where the fields occupied by houses bring poor in a thousand fold, while it takes away all tithe. How are tithes to meet the supply of the poor here? the clergyman himself is either labouring on a pen sion settled by law, or receiving himself the free-will alms and donations of his parishioners for his own often scanty support. It must be evident the case of tithes will not apply to save the Pro perty in the state at large from the burthen and just claims of the poor for relief. To relieve the prospect of the weight oppressing it, in contem plating the right of the poor, and the burthens thence that might overwhelm all Property, even of the most extensive pro prietors, a consolation offers for our consideration. That in states of any extent of tract of country, even our own insulated domi nions for instance, (though in particular instances of confined dis tricts and dense population, a case bearing a resemblance to the whole of the Property being in requisition for the poor, and yet not sufficing, may occur ;) the variety and uses and abundance is such, of Property in the mass, looking at an ordinary state of any soeiety, independent of extraordinary circumstances, that it is almost next to impossible that the wants of the poor, taking the country as a whole, shall ever exceed more than can well and facily be supplied, leaving ample superfluity to remunerate the exertions of the industrious, and of talent, as also to leave those who happily profit through the course which Property passes or descends, not of their own acquiring, ample for their own necessi ties, comforts, and happiness."], [204, "186 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON RIGHTS I speak in reference to the usual course and progress of things, in a social state, but not in reference to the mismanagement of the funds raised through defective laws or administration, or of public commo tion or calamity that cannot be foreseen, or provided against if seen. A great objection is made to the present system of the poor laws of England, and of course various are the arguments used against them by those who are opposed to the system, and the evils and defects enumerated, as a ground to substantiate their objections. It is however the principle of the poor laws in recognizing the Tights of the poor that I consider them both just and proper. It is only the mode of their constitution, and mismanagement that may be under them, that they are objectionable. The system and principle is both good and justifiable on the ground of claim and policy. It is not my intention to enter into their merits or defects. But as to the object they are instituted for, and which I think on the foregoing arguments they are most justly founded. There are unquestionably many things, errors or evils as they may be termed, comparatively with a better mode that might be formed, in the particular constitution of the poor laws, and evil arising in the management perhaps necessarily arising from them, as the occasion for them is of itself an evil, but an evil necessarily attendant on the constitution of society which must always bring with it that portion of society, we have termed the common poor. Yet the laws are good and just in principle as meeting the claims and rights of the poor : and deficient as they may be, they are a less evil, or a less prejudice to the society, than the evil other wise of the sufferings of the poor, and the moral evil of crime in the injustice of denying their rights, in refusing them relief, or a means of providing it for them. The providing for the poor is a matter of policy and of legis lation. To these we must look for the laws, and rules and regu lations, and if the measures provided are not founded on good policy that will meet the distress, and instead of aggravating or adding to the burthen, increase both, and the mode besides is offensive and degrading, and producing bad effects, that must be laid to the defect of the law, and want of art or wisdom in framing"], [205, "187 AS CONCERNING THEM IN PRACTICE. them, and making the laws and rules efficient for their object ; and not to the occasion which justifies and requires them can be attached any evil or injustice, of such defects. The policy which directs the legislature of making poor laws is not to increase or to aggravate the distress for which they are required, and while they give relief and afford all reasonable com fort, they ought not to encourage the wish or desire of the poor to apply to them, and this will be a rule or principle as evidently the wish of the poor themselves in calm consideration, as of those who have to supply their relief and maintenance. I had intended attempting to suggest a sketch of some plan or mode for making a provision for the poor and laws relative to the sub ject, but I have on consideration thought it would be such a di gression from my subject, although a subject springing out of it, and think it would, which I fear what I have already said on this subject in some degree may do, lead the mind too much away from the direct subject I wish to bring under the particular considera tion, the object I have in view in this work, namely, the exhibiting the law of the human judgment and the rights of men proceeding from it, and the importance of this to mankind. So important a subject however as the right of the poor to re lief and the mode of providing for it when there may be occasion, and forming part as it does of our subject of rights, I may I hope be excused for making a few observations on some points as refer able to Property. I will only offer a few general observations on the subject, more with a view for the consideration of others than under any presumption of supposing they would be efficacious or so bene ficial as abler judgment might suggest. The points I have therefore to advert to in the charges made on Property to meet the relief of the poor, and the observation will apply to other taxations, which is, that charges made where they destroy the means of their supply defeat their own object, and that with re gard to the cultivation of the soil, and producing supplies of all kinds for sustenance as well as for other purposes useful to the society, the charges imposed should be so managed as to avoid the land being thrown out of cultivation, or more charged than its produce is capable of meeting, with the continuing of the cultiva-"], [206, "188 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON RIGHTS tion, in order to obtain its produce for the benefit of the society at large, appear to be points to govern all charges and taxations ; and essential to good and judicious legislation on the subject. But 1 offer them as hints in this place as a matter essentially to be regarded for avoiding the aggravation of the evil of poverty. And more particularly as the case may apply to this country at the present day, it being with too much certainty to be appre hended much land that has been in cultivation is thrown out of culture, and much land is not brought into cultivation, arising from the burthens affecting it, by injudicious and improvident taxations, and charges, it must be considered ; not regarding that charges which swallow up the whole or greater part of the profit able return to the agriculturist or cultivator, must have this effect. That the pressure of relief of the poor might be more fairly and equally borne, it might be made the subject of a general sys tem of management by the means of stations, at the same time preserving the parochial divisions in regard to a just valuation and assessments, and for dispensing the relief in detail. By this means, the removal of the poor, and the disputes of settlement and great expense attending these last two matters might be avoided. As manufactories and all works requiring large numbers, and of uncertain employ, produce, generally, the greatest quantity of poor and distress, it appears but reasonable that they should con tribute specially to the support of those from whom the proprie tors derive the immediate benefits and riches of their labour. In charging landed Property, I would suggest, that not only the occupiers should be charged, but the landlords, receiving rent ; as both receive a profit, and both should therefore be charged in proportion, the one to his net produce, and the other to his rent. In cases where a man farmed his own land, a charge for profit in produce and supposed rent, would be implied on the preceding idea, should be made on such. A larger charge might certainly be made, but it does not follow, a man occupying his own land makes a profit in proportion to the farmer as a tenant, and the rent paid his landlord. It appears, however, but reasonable he should pay more than a farmer would, renting his land ; and as"], [207, "AS CONCERNING THEM IN PRACTICE. 189 it may be supposed, a man farming his own land pays more to his labourers, or employs more, and the stile of his farming is more expensive, and he contributes in this way to the circulation of currency, or to the benefit of society ; it might be reasonable to charge him on a valuation of his land, allowing for the greater number of hands, and the expense of husbandry, if such was the fact. On the subject of wages of husbandry, and period of hire, it will necessarily be regulated by circumstances and customs, and the laws and statutes which may be prevailing, either of a local or general nature ; but as a principle that cannot be too much in culcated, it does appear that the raising of a permanent service, at least, in so many hands as a farm requires constantly in employ, the wages and terms of service and treatment being such as would subsist the labourer comfortably, and attach the interest that would make him desirous of remaining where he was, and considering the interest of his employer, and as that in which his own interest was likewise depending, would be that best calcu_ lated to insure his honest industry and care in the labourer for the welfare of his employer. But whatever may be said upon this subject, the great point that offers for consideration, in regard to the subject of the claims of the poor on Property is the prevention of distress ; and the prevention or avoiding of the distress arising among the poor is far more preferable than the consideration of relief, and the means of affording it, when the necessity that requires it arises. The poor requiring it, and those from whom it must be drawn, or afforded, is a subject, too, certainly, to occasion dissatisfaction on both sides. The one thinking they are hardly used, and not sufficiently considered; the other thinking it a hard case their industry, and savings, and Property, are to be called upon to sup ply the wants of others. Those who are fortunate to possess even abundance and super fluity to excess, seeling that which any way interferes with their full and more entire enjoyment, and especially under the admis sion of a claim, or right, however modified, makes their title a questionable point ; but, at all events, a provisional enjoyment. A provisional enjoyment, however, be it always reflected, that"], [208, "190 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON RIGHTS under the peace and order of society, is assured to them, what ever reasonable subjections, for the good and welfare of the so ciety, (under which they hold, and are alone secure in their pos sessions,) are required to be submitted to. It must be evident to the poor themselves, that to repress the occasion of theirdistress thatrequires relief, offers the best prospects of the happiest and best mode of promoting their interests, that can be attained, or attempted to be effected, if within the power of man, reasonably to be effected. To have the power and means of sup porting themselves by the exertion of honest labour and industry, must place them in the happiest position of society. They be come of as much importance to their employer, as he is to them, and mutually indebted, under which, each feel the level of their importance, and combined with a just sense of rights ; and neither assuming, the one a false notion of superiority, or the other a pre tended humility. The pride acquired by power and affluence, it may be considered, would be corrected on the one hand, while on the other, those of more humble circumstances would be raised from the abject humiliation, created under want and the caprice of power and pride exercised over them, which engenders a feel ing of justification, when driven under their necessitous condition, to resort to insincerity, fraud, and deception ; and those evils, pride and abjectness, avoided, which affecting the one the rich, and the other the poor, the characters of both the one and the other are certain of becoming demoralized. Independent, supported on their honest labour and industry, the poor so happily circumstanced would take an interest under such prosperity, which would attach them to society and their fellow creatures, and cherish a sense of moral rectitude, which would be the best safeguard to preserve them, from debased man ners and criminality. In considering the subject of prevention of distress among the poor, from an overabundant population, as that must be consider ed to be the case, either locally or morally, where the numbers are exceeding the source and means of their employ. The local abundance is easily remedied, by removal where employment may be found, but where a population becomes too dense for this, it becomes a matter of consideration, how to regulate the conduct"], [209, "AS CONCERNING THEM IN PRACTICE. 191 to meet the exigency. The subject of population is considered by Mr. Malthus, to whose works I beg leave to refer ; and any correction can only be met by the regulation of the conduct of in dividuals themselves, and only to wholesome and moral restraint, we consider the intention of that able economist to extend ; and which apply as well to one class as to all, even to the more afflu ent classes of society, and not merely to the poor. Finally to the laws then, and policy, we leave the relief of the poor, and to the consideration of opening fresh sources of supply and employ in the wilderness of nature of any country remain ing unreclaimed, but capable of being rendered, by men, service able to the society of man, for sure is the world open to all the human race. The adverting to government and law is necessary and im portant as connected with rights, and being the means of effecting and securing them. Rights in themselves are, we have seen nothing more than the judgment of men, approving the good which is the authority and direction of man in all he does. But rights give men no power or means of effecting the good of men, farther than the sanction of men's minds or opinions, and the consideration of them, is but conveying to men what they mean or understand by the term rights ; and they consider they all ought to have or belongs to men in what they agree or admit is just or proper as concerns men, dependent on men. It is governments and laws that are the powers and authorities instituted by men, or supported, or maintained by men for effecting their rights. Government and laws are, there fore, based or founded for the object of men's rights, and the good of men in their rights, and for the security, preservation, and promoting, and, are the power or means resorted to by men, to ef fect them ; and generally for the purposes of peace and order, which are essential for the security of rights, as the infringement and injury of rights is the opposite to peace and order, as well as justice. At the time, nevertheless, men refer to what is good, or their rights, for their instituting of government and law ; govern ment or law, being raised as an authority over men, it is a mat ter' of command to control, and of necessity requiring their obedience, in priority, and superior, in respect of command, or"], [210, "192 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON RIGHTS requiring the obedience of men ; even to the rule of their direc tion in what they approve or not, as their rights are, and that which they may direct. We mean as to government and law being the superior authority over men, in reference to them, as subjects of the law, or as individuals in a state, subject and amenable to the laws ; for if governments and laws are not supe rior in command, then are they no authority over man, and the consequence is anarchy, confusion, and disorder in society. But we do not mean, by the superiority of command over men, which government and laws are, and is, necessarily, implied in their being instituted as the means of government and control of men, that they are superior to the primary law of men's judgment in what is morally right or good, which institutes them to effect its object. I have had occasion before, in the course of this work, to refer to the superior authority of the civil law to com mand ; but here I am bringing the subject of government and law under consideration relative to rights, and as the means of effecting them, and, therefore, have again occasion to advert to it. Rights, as a mere rule or estimate of man, and without the aid or means of more than opinion, but without force or power to effect them, and carry into effect the purpose or object of men, would be entirely at the power of individuals whether they chose, or it was their interests, individually considered, to regard them or not. Governments, laws, and ordinances are, therefore, re sorted to by men to protect and secure to men their good, and in this the regulation, and peace, and order of society, and in this, of justice. But laws so far engross the attention, or supersede the motive or object for which they are instituted, that they alone appear the rule and authority of men, that the purpose or object of their institution is much lost sight of, and in some cases, wholly forgot ten, in the institutions being ; but for which such institutions, namely, the effecting of the good of men, or their rights, originally were founded. We need not here waste our time in reverting to cir cumstances, or in revising governments of ancient date, or laws and constitutions, but confine ourselves to the object before us of the rights of men, and the institution of government and law to effect them."], [211, "193 AS CONCERNING THEM IN PRACTICE. Governments and laws based or founded on the rights of men, such is the object or purport of their institution to effect, and we have only to consider them relative to this object, the rights of men. Neither am I here entering into the constitution of go vernment or law. This is a matter of polity, and of the decision of men, as a congregate body, or in their collective capacity, or organized as constituents. Here we only consider the original law of his moral nature, in his judgment which directs him to establish government and law for effecting that, The formation or constitution of civil authority we do not here enter upon, as government or law are matters of polity and art, or forms, to ef fect the object of the moral law. But in their connection, or as his, man's, resort to them to effect his rights ; it is proper to no tice them so far, and their relative connection. Government and law as an institution to regulate and con trol men for the attainment and effecting their rights must ne cessarily be considered as delegated with power and authority to require the obedience of men. They are the authority of the en tire people, or must be so considered, in a collective or legislative capacity, reposed or placed in a form or institution to govern and command, for the general good ; and men as individuals, or as portions of the society, cannot be considered as having authority to oppose the power so constituted ; but as subjects are to pay obedience to them, and laws, therefore, necessarily are prior o\u00bb superior to any other authority of men, as command, and men as subjects are required to obey, or otherwise, government or law cease to be that power or authority to regulate and control men, and to effect the peace and order of society, essential to the good of men, and to secure their rights in that respect. I advert to the necessarily paramount authority of government and law, because it may happen, we may say, unavoidably hap pen, that the rule men have for their direction in their rights, although the base or object in, or for which government and law are instituted, in the complicated cases arising, and the supe rior object in the good of men generally or the society to pro vide for, there may be, occasionally, instances where rights or justice cannot be so particularly regarded as they ought ; but deviations, and occasional disregard, or neglect, or infraction of o"], [212, "194 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON RIGHTS rights, or partial cases of suffering will happen. These, as minor considerations to the good of men, and necessity of laws for that good, and as compared with the greater good of the law, must of necessity be borne with. Whatever evil may result from obedi ence to the laws are taken by the laws, and the subject is held discharged of them, provided he could not avoid them, but by disobedience of the law, in what are its positive commands to be observed in its penal injunctions, and not having a discretion in the case. When we speak of law for the general good, we do not mean that laws can be justified on the general good to do a partial injustice. But in a matter for the general good, if all are con sidered alike by the same law or rule, there is no injustice, what ever evils all may sustain. This is exemplified in all regula tions imposed by law for the general good, in such regulations, some wrong or evil may be sustained, but if all alike are the subjects of the same rule, there is no partiality or injustice, and the greater good or ostensible good of obedience to the law, justifies the measure in reason. Measures of policy, again, in government may oftentimes be very questionable as to their accordance with the moral rights of men, yet, on that account, it is not the less imperative or neces sary that men, as subjects, should obey the laws, and on the go vernment must rest the evil. On this head we have before made our observations, and will not discuss the subject farther than by adverting to them, and this notice. The rule men have for their direction in rights is a general law for man, and serves to direct as far as it applies, but men will not always interpret alike the rule in its particular applica tion, or observe it if they did, where particular interest, may be supposed to find an advantage in a deviation, or might do so in re ality ; consequently, governments and laws are raised to regulate and enforce their observance, and this very authority of itself is a power over man, that is an infringement upon his rights. They impose regulations, they impose tribute or taxes, they are a minor evil essential for, avoiding, and compared with, a greater evil in con fusion, disorder, and oppression or anarchy, because men of themselves will not always do right, or be agreed in rules and"], [213, "195 AS CONCERNING THEM IN PRACTICE. modes of action, subordinate or in relation to the prime rule of rights; and hence, such governments and laws, although imposing control and regulations, (which otherwise, but for the vices, fail ings of men, might be dispensed with,) are a moral good as the better or more beneficial course for men to adopt, and therefore reasonable, and because reasonable, moral. Of the right to protection and justice, this is a claim of men, of government, or at the hand of justice, granted in the estimation and judgment of men in the object, namely, good, for which go vernment and law are raised, and their powers and institutions established. This is proved by the judgment of men passed on them, where government or law is defective or inefficient for the purpose they are intended. Government and laws involve complex modes of consideration, as mixed with opposing interests, or objects, to be obtained, and in obedience to the law, that, requiring the occasional sacrifice of rights. As where all contingencies cannot be provided for, and of need minor good must be sacrificed for greater good, where opposing ; and lesser evils, must be endured to avoid greater evils. It is in the mixed and complex modes of action and consider ation, that any difficulty or perplexity arises ; but it is yet evi dent, an attentive consideration of these cases, will satisfy men of the necessity and benefit to them generally in government and laws ; and it is under the laws, that exceptions may arise to the moral rule, and be submitted to, in the higher necessity there is, in regard of obedience to government and laws by men as subjects. But it is here only, that a departure may be occasioned from the moral law, that men can receive sanction, or justification ; and in such cases only, can be exempt from the moral obligations and duties of men towards one another. The exceptions themselves presup pose, or presume a necessity for a greater good in men's obedience to the laws, paramount to the lesser duty, or good, as between men one towards another in respect to their moral rights, and observ ance of their duties in such cases. It may be, and I believe often is imagined, and maintained by some, that laws give men their rights, and that their rights only o2"], [214, "196 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON RIGHTS proceed from such authority, and that men can have no claim or title in such respect but through the laws, or what they permit or recognise or do not interdict. But if laws alone gave men their rights or men had no claim or title to their good but through the laws, then men could have no claims but through such authority, nor would men have any responsibility but what was recog nizable by the laws, or in any matters or acts but what were amenable to the law, and the evil of this, and the fact of this not being the case, is too obvious to need being pointed out. But if this were the case that laws gave men their rights ; whence, let us ask, do the laws derive the rule or principle of their dispensa tions ? Is it on their arbitrary authority, that what they pro claim is right or ought to be as to men, is so, on that dictum alone ; or does it seek a source in the dictates of the human breast, and a reference to reason to investigate, enquire and de termine thence on those feelings inwardly prompted, its approba tion, or the contrary ? Surely the answer to this is, it is consi derate of what is for the service of the state or society, or in other terms, for the good or benefit of men the subjects of that state, and refers to the inward motive that promotes unwittingly all to their good, but applying, for a guide, to the mind or reason of man to direct its course or proceedings. When laws prohibit or punish theft or robbery, assault and murder, support the good against the unjust, the weak against the strong oppressor, and maintain and support the power of government and law to protect the good and peaceable, and to dispense justice, and give laws for the regulation and good of the state and society, the law has in this, the good of men, and in this their rights, and what reference or evidence can be stronger than that the good of men is the motive, and their rights the rule, that is referred to on the appeal to rea son or common sense, as the purpose or object that is to be met, aud towards which object, namely, their rights, which is their good, the efforts are directed to serve, however unseen, or lost sight of, or however, in consequence of such want of science in their subject, it remains unknown or insufficiently known, or not properly re garded, and under such clouded vision is often perverted or mis takenly directed, and wrong arc men's course or proceedings. The"], [215, "AS CONCERNING THEM IN PRACTICE. 197 rights, therefore, are pre-existing to the law which is but raised on their account, and referred to in effect in every measure of its proceeding that is approved or esteemed by man. But some knowledge of the motive or admission of a principle that is a rule or guide to men, is admitted in cases where the consciences of men are aided by their faith ; or principles are assumed that men should obey in obedience to their consciences as responsible beings to the Supreme Being; for in these instances it is most notorious men are called on to follow and adopt what is morally right or correct, and frequently in opposition and in de fiance of laws, being evident there is another rule of action, and one of higher reference than the laws, though submitting to them in obedience, as where it happens the mode of action required in conformity with the laws may not be strictly in accordance with moral duties, or moral rectitude. For though what is moral and good is the foundation and object of all laws, as it is of every thing human, or proceeding from moral man, yet it may happen from their errors, from defects, and various opposing circum stances, that the laws may not always be in strict conformity with the principle on which they are founded in the good, and for the promoting it, but sometimes on the ground of policy that is held sometimes almost to sanction measures and lines of proceed ing certainly any thing but correctly moral, are the very reverse. Be that as it may, men are notoriously called upon to obey moral courses even to disregard the laws, and men's consciences are often the excuse offered for their opposing the laws ; and not un frequently received, if not as men's exculpation of offence to the laws, yet as an , alleviation of the crime of stubbornness or refrac tory conduct, or mode of proceeding as opposed to what may be the law. There must be in these cases and on all occasions where men are called on to regard their moral duties, however imperfect for want of scientific arrangement or developemcnt, knowledge and in struction, among men in morals may be, a law, and a law of their direction separate from and even preceding the instituted law, both in time as to men's acquaintance with it, and in a supposed priority of obedience from a priority of claim upon men for obe dience, and which in fact is the law of the human judgment,"], [216, "198 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON RIGHTS though not so seen or admitted. But as laws, while acknowledged, must ever be that which in point of command are the superior au thority over men as subjects to such, that whatever may be the su perior authority of his rule of rights, as a matter of approvement, it must yield in obedience to the laws as a command. But I deem it right in saying this, to add, that it is not to uphold the claim referred to here which laws must be considered to have over men as subjects, as opposing the consciences of men or their duties to the Supreme Being, but adverting to such superiority of claim to obedience to the laws on the ground, that laws themselves are the means conformable with the reason of man, and therefore the ful filment of the duty or design of the Supreme Being, as man can discern, in the best way he can. And laws when differing from the consciences of men, it must either be in their mistake, or in the impracticability of that, the conscience may dictate, or point out, with the more imperious good, and therefore imperious de mand of obedience to the laws. We do not speak here of usurpa tion of all power by the laws or of laws obviously reckless of all moral good and rights. It is evident, therefore, that men's notions of morals, and of good, and consequently of their rights, must precede the laws, and governs what men approve, in what really is good or right relatively, although not always of command, where laws interfere with or oppose them. To say nothing that laws are not general, but only particular or specific directions to men for certain pur poses the objects of the law, and that laws, generally speaking, leave the conduct of men as to their duties towards one another generally to the implied knowledge men have of morals, and im posing only restrictions in cases of real or supposed wrong conduct requiring prohibition, or in other cases imposing observances which it considers ought not to be omitted, admitting a reference to another authority, that, in fact as it is shewn to be the law of the human judgment and the rule it gives men of their rights. The fact is undeniable, that men derive their rights from their judgment, as has been established in what has been previously said and shewn here upon the subject ; and an authority prior to all law or government, and as a rule of direction in what man approves or not, it precedes government and law as well as every"], [217, "AS CONCERNING THEM IN PRACTICE. 199 thing, they all being approved or esteemed as they agree with rights, or being the contrary, are deemed wrong, though under circumstances of necessity, as before alluded to, they may be adopted, or tolerated, though not in strict conformity, or con sistent with rights. It is a rule, therefore, independent of law, existing of itself from the source derived in the moral nature of man ; and if laws and governments did not exist ; yet still, would the moral rule of rights, founded on the moral law of the human judgment, exist to direct man ; and when clearly developed to him, would obtain his attention and obedience, and lead him to adopt all that was rational and proper, or in accordance with it, for the furtherance of his, man's, motive and object, namely, his good. It is not denied, nor is it meant to deny, that laws do give men rights, and impose duties or observances on men, and many rights, as civil rights, are raised, and necessarily given by the laws, and enjoyed by men under them. But the moral rights are purely those existing and depending on men's judgment, approving what is good, and, therefore, what ought to be, as rests with, or is dependent on men, and exists by the discernment and judgment of men, independent of all other law, except that of the judgment, for every man knows and desires to have what is good and beneficial for him, and approves this in his judgment, and that his good consists in his Life, Pro perty, and Justice, and that these belong to all men, although laws may promulge, support, and promote the moral rights of men, and, in fact, as a principle, always do, as to the object, namely, the good ; yet in such case, they are only as a means to effect, or auxiliary, the engine or machinery established to ac complish the moral purposes, and do not originate the rule itself, for the origin of the rule is the law of the human judgment. Laws, certainly, give and prescribe rights to men, and laws may declare or express what are the moral rights of men, and what is the law, may be in strict conformity and correspondence with moral rights, and always imply them in object and effect, in what is good ; the moral rights are, nevertheless, not dependent upon laws for their existence ; the moral rights exist purely on the human judgment, of what is good and whatever men see and"], [218, "200 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON RIGHTS, ETC. judge this to be, are their rights. And for their direction, their Lives, their Property, and Justice, offer themselves as matters which can be referred to specifically, as what his good consists of, as a means of giving him better information or instruction of the knowledge of morals and its concerns, and what every thing may be referred to, or comprehended under, for his consideration, for his di rection. Laws may give or confirm these to men, but they do not originate their rights, laws themselves being founded but for these things, to maintain and secure them ; and as they may accomplish their object, or are deficient for their purpose, are they adjudged good or bad, as they effect the former, or produce the reverse. The moral good is implied, therefore, in all laws; and whether proclaimed or not by the laws, as their object, will be that, which, founded for its promotion, preservation, and maintenance, will be meant and approved, and by which the laws will be influenced, and directed in all their objects and purposes, unless interfered with by policy of measures, or mistakenly, or viciously perverted. I have before disclaimed here all intention of entering on the constitution of governments and laws, as these belong to polity or the art, or science, of government and legislation. But whatever they may be, the ENQUIRY now made, I hope, is sufficient, (however defective, for the great purpose intended, as that cer tainly is, of an exposition of the moral powers of man, that move and govern him, and the rule he has for his direction,) to enable all men to see clearly the law of the human judgment, and that it gives them a rule for their direction in their rights. That the law, giving men a rule for their direction in their rights, gives them a rule in government and laws as institutions, the purport and object of which are to effect the rights of men ; and that whatever the constitution of these may be, with the rule developed thus clearly, government and laws will, of necessity, be directed or confined to their purpose and object, and that modes will be rendered more pure and simplified, and obvious to the compre hensions of men, for effecting the general object of all mankind, the good, and securing to men their rights ; and which, better understood, governments and laws will afford more satisfaction and happiness in the purposes for which they are of necessity instituted."], [219, "r APPENDIX. Having, as we think, and hope, manifestly and clearly shewn, that the human judgment is the law of man ; and that the rights to his good exist in, and are, the approving judgment of men, of that good, the moral good as concerning himself the being, man ; we have not deemed it requisite in our discourse to pursue the consideration of that law or authority as regards itself further ; but rest on the exposition given as sufficient for our purpose, and therefore, to avoid encumbering the argument with further dis quisition, have proceeded upon the work, in the consideration of the judgment as the law of man, and as the source and authority of his rights, and the various matters considered connected with the subject of that law, namely, as giving man his rights \u2014 the errors of men in respect of their rights whence derived \u2014 the duties of men being co-existent with rights \u2014 and the final notice on equality of rights not being equality of good. But as it may be acceptable to the inquisitive mind, the consider ation of the law itself as the good of man, I have subjoined the following observations as an appendix, not to interfere with the course of the exposition that has been adopted ; and which, as being the plain fact and truth, has, therefore, been considered quite sufficient for use and practice, for information and instruc tion upon the subject. In the reference that is made to the law or authority of man in the human judgment, which we hope we have made sufficiently clear and evident to all, so as not in any manner to be doubted ; we have not adverted to the judgment itself in approving what is good, being, in itself, its own act of approbation, in what is morally, or rationally consistent in regard to man, good. This will be apparent ; when it is considered that what the"], [220, "202 APPENDIX. judgment approves as consistent, or in agreement with the sub ject considered, man, (or what is moral) is, in itself, the same as, and identified with, good. And the judgment in fact to be con sistent with itself, must needs approve what is good, or consist ent with that, the subject of its consideration, or being con trary, it would not be sane, or healthful ; and which it is not where it is incongruous, or not in accord, with that which is evi dently consistent, or in agreement with the subject it is applied to, and it is hence termed insane ; and such is the case with the being man, when unfortunately this great characteristic fails him in perverted judgment and conclusions in self-evident and appa rent facts, or in true premises in which it has, or attempts, to judge. The judgment, however, is a power separate and distinct from that it judges of, or applies to externally, or not being the judgment itself, as affecting or concerning man ; and as that separate and distinct matter, or power, gives the right or claim or title in its approving what is good, and is the power, or law, deriving to man his rights in such its approbation, and for his justification in adopting what is so, and acting correspondently with that so es teemed. So that it is apparent that the judgment approving the good being in itself good, yet the statement that it is the authority of rights, or that his, man's rights, are derived from it, is quite cor rect, because it is by the act of approbation that they exist ; and the approbation is distinct and separate from that approved, and is therefore the power or authority in that approbation. And in this, the right or claim or title to that approved. It is not necessary to state the fact of the judgment, being in itself good, for the purpose of establishing, or rather we should say of exhibiting the rights of men to be derived from it ; but as a question, or matter, that may occur to many in their considera tions of the subject, we have thought it advisable to notice it, to point out that in the reference to it as the authority of rights, we have been quite correct, that those considering the point may not upon first adverting to the fact that the judgment approving the good, is in itself good, suppose it makes any difference in its being the authority, it is referred to as it is, and by so doing"], [221, "203 APPENDIX. cause a doubt in their minds to be thrown on the fact of men de riving their rights through such law or power : or that through any mistake, however absurd such must be, seeing that the judg ment is in itself good, consider it may not be the sanction or au thority to men, as in fact and truth it really is ; and which, as before observed, we hope it is past contradiction or mistake shewn to be. But, for the prevention, or mistake, that might be made, by touching on any new point, which such is that is not considered in the body of our work, and this is such, to which we make adversion, have we considered it necessary to explain, that the judgment approving the good, is the same as, or identified with the good itself, is in no way, and cannot be considered, otherwise, than authority to man ; and as such, the source whence he de rives his rights in the approbation of what is good.
