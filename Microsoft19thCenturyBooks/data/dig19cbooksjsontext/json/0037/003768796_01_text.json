Strange it is, That after all my toil and weariness In hewing at it, now 'tis fallen there, I scarce can bear to look on't ; so like A man cut down, 'midst life and strength and beauty.

He neither heeds nor hears : his vision next Is bent on yonder tall and solemn pines, Whose straight bare trunks and high and airy heads Shoot upwards most of all our forest's trees Unto the sky.
